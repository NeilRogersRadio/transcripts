I'm at him at the Marlon's. He's a great guy. Yeah, I'm at him at the Marlon's. Morning Neil. Yeah, good morning Neil. Good morning crap. Yeah, you and yours. There are 500 who's laughing now. Woo hoo hoo, heavy duty, man. What about 85 on a straight line? Hey, listen. You got a great job. You're missing a breaking news story of all time's port story. What? The bronze James on CNBC on the gambling channel. Being interviewed by Maria Bartowromo with a heavy bags under her post. Taking his crotch like he was digging for gold for like 15 minutes. I've never seen anything so gross in my life. That sounds like something I see every morning around here. Yeah, this morning, this morning for else, coming in at Moe, digs for gold in his spectrum and front everybody else. I want you to tell the audience this. He's picturesing them and back of his pants and everybody else and digs her finger very sweet. And the front. I love that he's so comfortable with the Ferrari that he can. He can work that. Mine. I don't want to remind you one thing. The first day that you came on a year. Yeah. And he reached out and shook your hand. Like maybe seconds ago. Oh, they were saying there was some bad art there. A little, all the crap you could run out. A little crap you could unwrap. You could unwrap. You could get a little better. You know, remember, I think a man used to smell that. He smells his collar finger. See how it works now. Oh, see how it works. See how it works. Oh, crap you could unwrap. See what kind of weather systems are blowing through the area. So you've got the blue jays in the Marlins. You're too favorite teams. Toronto's playing great ball. Oh, God. I'm talking about you. Great. Great. Baseball out there, man. What's the problem? Blue jays are only two games out of first. I heard that guy from Canada yesterday called you. He was like, hey, dude, we got to be where do you live up here? It was great. That guy sounded like a friend of mine. I swear to God, he sucked me. And so bad. I thought I was a friend of mine from the hockey news. From their offices there. Probably was Bob McKinsey. Some Montreal. I spoke. I hit for the cycle. I know you're excited about that. I'm talking about the brown james picking his crotch on the worldwide he lives at the December. This guy, this guy has got like like the mad dog would say he's got the IQ of a boxer rock. I hope that he has the worst down nine. He's very dollars for a guy who couldn't write an X to show his word dick. And I'm glad he has to play in crappy Cleveland, which is like playing in hell. And they're going to stink. He's going to stink. And I'm telling you that he's going to show my men. He's a little boy with a big card. His mama likes to steal from the little girl. He's got a big toy. He's got his big card. And all the little black kids love him. And you know what? I hope he drowns in his own. The hypocrisy of the amount of attention this kid gets. You hope he drowns in a sea of his own excrement. In fact, I hope he slides off the road. His home on the right. I don't care if the kid dies. You know, the NBA to me is about as exciting as one of most bowel movements. You probably got a little piece of the evidence on it. And I want to work with George on Fridays. What's the problem? That's another story. All these people are lying. They're all lying. We got more freaking liars than every time. You have to know from muff and clearance. They break. They break. Ask me if I was actually farting on the mic. So near. Yeah. I mean, I think I do have better farts than you. But I know farting. And I told me that you volunteered to like help out. But I'm on do my two day weeks. And I'm going to do eight to noon in Georgia, Do ten and two money once being farted. Two and one. One and one. They went out. They went out. Let's hear the truth. Well, they want me to do eight to noon. They're going to have to, you know, get some ship and Cache in here from over to on the other coast. And say, I told him I just wanted to do an hour with George on Friday. And then I'll still cost about the ass. My great. There's one thing I have. Like champions. Man, it's the a two-way muffin. They lie to the team. I want free food. Lots of money because I'm good looking. I'm pretty. I'm on a move. And I'm like you. I need lots of cash to entertain the masses. And there's plenty of any it's down or tane. Maybe that's what Mo is reaching in the behind. Or maybe he's going to pull out the never see anybody. Just openly pick their trout. You know, something I wish you would have told us this yesterday morning. We're going to put it on our pole. He works on his pole. I see it with a full fist on into the saddle. I can't even see the window. I love what he does in that. He just has no mercy. I mean, I can see him up there at the country club. Up at the buffet table. Picking his mind. Yeah. Oh, crap. You can unwrap. Oh, I'm just brief. Because you know he wears those lights. Maybe just right. Or we connect a bag. You look like I'm about that. Maybe the novel fell out. How big they got. How old they got. Howard David's bitch. Now usually I don't do this. But let me tell you a little bit about the way. I was a little bit about the wheels that I drive to work in. Now I'm not trying to be rude, but you can really get screwed. By those dealers trying to sell you. You're automobile brand new. See I don't need the fancy grails. All those new consummants. I've had my baby 20 years. She can all those stripped out gears. See the horn go. And the horn go. It got a four on the floor. It got a four on the doors. But not a hell of a lot more. It needs a brand new ignition. It got a broken transmission. It got some holes in the body. Got front and rear fenders. It's in the excite to son of a gun. But I'm like so water grums. It's a piece of you know what? You get at least it's paid for a huh. 10.07 at 5.60 WQM. That is the grossest thing. I mean combining the bronze James picking his package on worldwide TV. They're a thundermary of art aroma. And I'm not just talking about like, you know, we chained down like adjusting briefly. I'm talking about like, uh, Give it a hand. Just, just, I just kept screaming at the set. Get the camera off this crazy bastard. Give it over, you know, wouldn't do it. And anyway, and then of course here in about most picking seeds out of his Thundermat is, it'd be here to run. Could have a pick off. Didn't. Yeah, well, that's a baseball thing. Oh, it's a pick off in first base. Anyway, look at that. We're going to get 1600 votes on yesterday's poll. So we'll wait because we need five more. Being a boy's got some more tragic stories anybody wanting to hear? No, no. I just can't handle you anymore. I can't handle these tails of whoa. Whoa. Yeah, you're starting to turn into another Eric now. Whoa. It like that crap, you know, we can't handle it. He did show up though today and it's how salinity is real quiet. He's working. He's working on what? I'm getting the stories up. He's an artist. I noticed he also let us down yesterday. He was going to put the instructions on our web page. How to get rid of that crap. All those pop up things. Didn't see him on there. He'll do that really quickly too. Huh? Taking care of all. We switched rooms. So he's in there using your computer. And I'm in here. I see. I see. That's good. So there was let's keep him off the air for a while. So I do get a bunch of lies from Clarence and Duff now. That's not there to defend himself today because he's getting his assets. They got a search party to see who's been in there. But so he's not in. But Clarence was in Brighton early this morning. He's been in Brighton early this morning.

Hey, listen, why should they go out and waste the 28 bucks when it can hear it for free on his show and in addition, which it's now we're 28 cents. She says, This is a third paragraph page one, okay? See if they would take this every day they could like put it together like into a talking narrative. My story began in the years following World War II and men like my father who had served their country returned home to settle down, make a living in razor family. It was the beginning of the baby boom and optimistic time. The United States had saved the world from fascism and our nation's working the United former adversaries in the aftermath of the war reaching out to allies in a former enemies, securing the peace and helping to rebuild a devastated Europe and Japan. How do you like that? Starting in pretty emotional, ain't it? Yeah, I'm getting a lot of money. Every review of her book that I've read has been skewing. Basically, she doesn't say a goddamn thing. It's a lot of pages nearly 600 pages didn't say a goddamn thing, but nevertheless, between that and Harry Potter people are like, just grab it enough like solid gold. Here's the pull result. Which of these statements about Mohour David and you, uh, believe most strongly, 1600 votes a great total. He's a total asshole 47 who picks seeds out of his button for everybody else. 30.4%. He's alienated just about everyone, 295, 185% who's Mohour David, 285. Still 17.8% haven't got a clue who the old man is. His talk show blows 277.3% Neil picks out of too much. 144.9%. Remember what was like about 13% yeah, and then it went to 10. Then it was like just a little over eight and then I made a comment about that and they boosted up to over nine, but now it's 8.9%. He does great play by play 75 or 4.6%, he's a great talent only 37, 2.3%. Out of 16.4, on a Mohour David pull from yesterday. And then this keep in mind is before they knew that he picks seeds out of his button in front of everybody else. I still think he's trying to reinsert the tube. 2.5%. Cold date for fresh breath. Maybe a soccer flush. Seriously, don't you think that if you had like a bag that you have to, I don't want to get too graphic, but don't you have to like stick the tube somewhere? Maybe he's applying prep H. Anyway, here's our first fan. I still can't get over to LeBron James thing. I'm not exaggerating. It was just beside the fact that for 90 minute bucks, he can't say crap. He's just he's done more than sawdust. And he's on there and he's like adjusting and moving around his package and got his hands in his crotch and poor Maria. You could see she was getting really uneasy and just start interviewing one of the other. Oh god, who also couldn't speak by the way. Here's the fact that says hello, Neil. Sounds a little like tough. I'll have to do the break first because this is a lengthy couple of facts. Very important stuff. Today is Wednesday, by the way. Oh, right.

The process of cloning has always been extremely controversial. It began in 1997 when scientists cloned Dali the sheep since that time. Millions of dollars and countless laboratory hours later scientists at the University of Idaho are reveling in another incredible cloning breakthrough. It's the world's first cloning of a mural. Scientists now say based upon this incredible success they have plans to clone other asses with me Houston. My eyes. My Tyson. I broke my back. Rosio Donald. Little really well. Monica Lewinsky. I was some sick-draged person. Dylan Hillary Clinton. I was very more a world than I did. I didn't want to. That's certainly what I did right now. Ascoding. Ten-18. I love the way that just like chops right off at the end there. All the crap you can unwrap. All the slime all the time. Absolutely. Anyway, we got to the new pull us up there. I'm gonna use the delay as soon as I gave the result of yesterday's pull on Mo. Eric got that new thing up there faster than you could say. I'm telling you it was incredible. Do you see that? We saw it. The new pull is up there and the voting is started. The new pull is should Neil keep posting the bedtime stories on the website. We got six choices for you. First choice. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's important. I rarely read them. I only care about the pull. I mostly care about the goofy stuff. I'd rather see more naked pictures. Or I don't need it. I read lots of news websites. I think that covers from either from our Vark to Z. Don't you? That not could pick up. Should I now? Yesterday would have been very interesting if we could add a, even a Mo. Picks a lot of winners. Yeah, maybe Hank ought to take them to the racetrack with him because he seems to be picking a lot of winners lightly. I can't, I just can't envision that. So an old guy like him reaching into his lime green checkered pants and digging around for gold and his ass. I mean, in front of everybody else. It's just more than we can handle. I thought of it. Makes me nauseous. So we got, well, we got five oats on there. It'll be real interesting to see this, you know what? To see whether the fruits of our labor now. Let's see. Let me read this facts first because this one's a little more coherent than the other one. It says, here's my opinion regarding the bedtime stories. Keep doing this as much as a pain as it is to do it. If it's stopped and there'll be no single good source for these articles, common sense.com and the others are good, but don't provide the same resource that you do as you refer to all sorts of new sources, where the other sites rely mainly on their own writers and contributors. Moreover, your stories are from all sorts of media outlets from around a planet, also by starting with your stories. I found those media outlets and of red news are other news articles or opinions that it's all. This provides me with the opportunity to determine if those outlets, newspapers, etc. have a particular political or philosophical slant. Also seeing the same information in different articles from a variety of sources is worthwhile, not only for the usefulness of having the same facts discussed from different points of view, but also for the satisfaction that the information, especially, that could be considered to be anti-bossious out there and being stringingly researched and reported. What is goes on? Lastly, in my opinion, anyone who feels the bedtime stories should cease completely even partly perverse having their head in the sand or up their own ass, or is the type to call it a media just so they can say, retire. Thus fulfilling whatever purpose I don't know what that word means. Pathetic naval and picking need they have, or as picking is the case may be. I hope that even if the poll shows disfavor with the bedtime stories, that use last George Slash Carlos continued to post them anyway, slash Carlos. Well, I'll add this point, could it hurt? Also, I've be curious to this to the percentage of people responding to your poll who are from South Florida versus from some place else, and of those witch groups, South Florida, and the versus some place else, both to keep the stories compared to those who don't. This is one South Florida, and says, keep the stories and keep up the good work. Wow. As an aside, I couldn't do your job except for the money. If I had to beg for calls at times, then have to listen to more runs, A-hols, and other losers in the quantity that you do have it of hung up the head set, and move permanently to Toronto Florence, or Cologne long time ago. Well, let's talk to me, church about that. What do you say? Do you know what my church is, motto? All the crap you can unwrap. Yeah. Now, let's see, how's the early voting on this? Uh, Bino by the way is working frantically, because let me just give you the update on today's chapter in the Bino boy's soap opera. His father has Crohn's disease, and he had an attack. He's in the hospital. He's going to be a stepfather. He's going to be okay, though, right? Yeah. He's fine. He just has these attacks a whole times a year. That's an nasty thing. Luke Crohn's disease, very, that's a kishki disease, intestinal thing. And the other thing is his computer just died. Blue up. It's been under verge and it died. Boy, I'm telling you, if I was you, I would like to be very, very careful than I crossed the street. In fact, I wouldn't cross the street. How does that get to you? He's working frantically on my computer on that nice new one that I bought with my own harder and money. And who get those bedtime stories on there today? And I whether we continue with this or not depends, of course, on a poll and whether we want to agree with it or not. 60 votes already should Neil keep the bedtime stories on the website. Absolutely. Yes, important. Absolutely. 28. I'd rather see more naked pictures, 19. I want to care about the poll. I don't need it. I read lots of news websites for. I mostly care about the goofy stuff too. That was probably, you know, the two work clearance in the beast. And I rarely read them too. Well, we got votes for every category on there. I think so it goes another good example of a stupidist pull. Here's another. This is a silly fact. I mean, it's intended as a serious fact, but I find it so amusing. George, I mean, this guy's name is George. That's what I'm talking about. George and Pablo B's. I don't want to like make funnier. I don't want to like because obviously the intentions are good. And you're an old, cool, like me, but George, come on. Says hello, Neil, long time listener. First time, facts are. I can remember when you used to say taking a stand would not accomplish anything just a wasted time. But I really like what you're doing about the bushes and that we're going through. You should have said the bushman. Also, I heard what you said about his tax cuts going the majority was so true. I started writing this last night. I would be sure if I should now after the last few minutes of yesterday's show. I know it's worth the effort. By the way, we're not a time because I just got that story. I don't know if anybody could understand it because I was reading so fast. We got it. Did you get it? Although it's very good. I didn't fumble too much to that because I had a very limited time. It was bad, bad timing. Anyway, here's the sentence. Here's the greatest sentence I've ever received in a facts of all time. Okay, hold on. Strap yourself in. It says, Neil, we need you to save this country. I even circle it with my pen. That is a great lie. We the people of the have not that includes me a 55 year old trailer park resident says, George, I've been a part of the world. I've been a part of the world. I've been a part of the world. I've been a part of the world. I've been a part of the world. I've been a part of the world. And it includes me a 55 year old trailer park resident says, George, Need a new beginning and new start, if you will. Neil, I'm as serious as a heart attack when I say we need to abolish the income tax, run our country on a national sales tax, and otherwise then income tax. This will close all the loopholes for those big corporations and the wealthy. The have-skins start supporting this wonderful country and give the lower class of fighting chance and chance to save some money. Maybe work harder and extra job, instead of to make more money. Maybe we can all pay our own medical bills and buy food and housing. I think our country would roll so to speak. With your internet site, which is by the way great, and being on a radio you or we or us, I think, can make a difference. Search the night, it's already started. Search a ballastian, come to action, see the future. Here are a couple of places to start. Partitiononline.com slash nith with and detacksus.com. Neil, if you don't help here, oh, here we go again. I want you to listen very carefully, George and Beiner Boy. We're listening. We're listening. We're listening. Neil, if you don't help here, I think the country is going to go to part. And then in parentheses, to show you how serious this whole thing is. And parentheses, it's in total, George. But seriously, please give it some thought. Neil, thanks for everything, sign G. I'm not going to use his name, Pompatob HPS. G-Rod is a great job on a radio. That has got to be. We need you to save this country, Neil. That's right. We need you on a radio. You're going to save the country from itself. You're going to save mankind. God, I never realized I had that responsibility on my slope old, Faggy shoulders. What do you do? Well, if you don't save us, I'm going to hear all the poetry. I'll show you the much different altitude from now on. I guess it's more than just a paycheck. Which today is paid aid, by the way. Right. At QAM when our slogan is, All the crap you can unwrap, all the slime, all the time. Absolutely. That's it. 1027 at 5. 6. You have that thing going. Oh, look at that. They want the event time story. So far, and maybe we can also include some naked pictures. What do you say with that? Hey. Sounds good to me. Here's a copy.

Aren't you impressed? Yeah, okay. Shouldn't you keep posting the bedtime stories on a website? No, the reason that I'm impressed right now is because I was thinking of myself during the break. What will be the demarcation line? In other words, what percentage do we need to give us the encouragement? You're a truly invoiler boy to continue all the work that's involved in this crap on her. And I'm thinking like over 50%. When you? I wanted to put them on no matter what. Because I think if even we get it through the cover of people, it'll be worth it. Did somebody give you like a silver-ish-plated shovel for your birthday? I'm serious. Because you keep digging yourself a whole so deep. You're going to wake up on the day you're going to have to speak to your attorney of Chinese or Japanese. Seriously? I'm trying like don't you see the method in my madness here.

Do we have a call on it? Oh, we have a couple actually. Because when I looked up their last time there wasn't a call on the board. And I got a guy faxing me. Tell me I need to do this. I need to do that because I'm going to save the world. We can turn things around baby. And I'm thinking we can't even get the poll questions right. I'm always bragging about what a great poll I do yesterday. One of the choices was Neil Tixon, Mo Too much. We should also add one. Mo Picks is asked too much. Right. But we didn't know. But we didn't have the information. And let me just say this. This isn't something for elders made up by himself. Because you were telling me this before I ever spoke to for all this morning. Right. Well, I got. I mean, I got there between the door or door and the hallway door, you know. Yeah. They were just shouting it in the hallway there. They were out there. Apparently today was the day that they went over the top and couldn't take it anymore. He went over the edge. He stilled over. Oh no. Mo keep your hand out of your ass in public. Okay. If you're driving home in your SUV or if you're driving a Jaguar and not given day. And you want to reach down in there and start groping around and the digging for dollars or whatever you're digging for. That's fine. If nobody can see it. So I'm going to lend a like well in the workplace. I think there's something legal involved there in the workplace. Don't you? I do. Anal harassment. I'm going to give for all my camera to borrow, of course, so that we can get a picture of the picture. And my cable just went out. Can you believe that? I cable went out. Maybe because it's too hot. Do you know what's going to mean? Oh, it just came back on. Gonna be 95 here today, a little on the Toasty side. 95 sunny don't know rain. Should Neil keep posting the bedtime stories on a website? Absolutely. Yes. It's important. Absolutely. Just over 50% is right. It's hovering 74 out of a total of 146. 50.6% lot of pressure now. I'd rather see more naked pictures 40. I really think we could pacify them. We could make them a little bit more naked pictures with each bedtime story. We're not happy. We could do that. Just imagine how we could educate the world out there. Just like George and Pomp and a Vita's. We could save the world. Just put a little bit of nudity on there. And then if they, you know, that would that would be the magnet. That would be the magnet. And draw them in. And then they just might read the story. They'll see the catchy headline you put on. And they'll say, oh, that might be interesting. Before I scrolled out of the next naked picture. I only care about the pool 12. I really read them nine. I don't need it. I read lots of news websites. Six. And I most care about the goofy stuff. Goofy like that. Five. That's why it's laying out so far. I'm glad we're doing this because, you know, you have no way of knowing. Although we have had a spectacular response on our website. And especially, you know, when it really boost up big time. Wait, when we went back to tend to to. When for Rell 1 on 8 to 10, we went back to tend to. Oh, yeah. Check it. We had a spike on that website. Man, it was like all of a sudden we didn't have nothing but naked pictures. Like a porno website. We had such phenomenal response. By the way, Carlos is going to put many, many naked pictures on there today. So be sure and check it out. Check it out. Now we're not. We put naked pictures on the building by camera. Let's just lie a lot. Okay. Oh, and in fact, I want to see. Since we've been so creative on those, I love to see a picture of most picking seeds from his, Bracom when happy lovely. Or working on that. Because you know what they say. You have to plant the seed first. And then watch it grow. You have to fertilize it. Oh, here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hi, Neil. How are you? Is your radio show back up to the website now? What does that mean? Well, you're Paul Resolved. Show that, you know, majority of your followers, at least want to listen to the website stories. And you don't play it on the radio anymore. So I think you can be more aware of it. I don't play the radio. What does that mean? Well, you always, you know, Teases that you're going to read a story, but you never do. Yes, I do. I've read it. In fact, I read two of them, two or three yesterday. And how long is your show? So, in other words, what you're doing is you tell me I should go back to reading the stories all day again. Well, look at the poll results. No, I see. I looked at a poll that's much more important and that is during the seven months that I was doing at the poll. I would live by in his business called our ratings. And it was not. It wasn't a winner. They didn't like that. So you're saying, then, the internet people are different from your listeners. No, I'm saying that if we put it on the internet, those people, I mean, 50 percent want the bedtime story so far. It means the other 50 percent don't want to. We can't afford to blow off the other 50 percent for me to sit here and read them all on the air every day. But those people who do want it, they can go on air and read to their hearts content. They're there. Well, I must say, though, you do seem a lot happier. You seem a lot happier since you've gone to the bathroom for gay, humor. You know, whatever makes you happy. Well, what does that mean? So in other words, that's a shot. Is that what you're telling me? Yeah. Because it doesn't make a lot of your listeners happening. Happy. Because it's just adolescent, frankly. Yeah, well, you don't want to have a nice life. Okay. Okay. What a bitch. What an absolute sea of next time, honey. See you next time. Bitch. It's adolescent. I've been doing a show for a thousand years, honey, and for seven months out of all that time, I did the bedtime stories. It was an experiment because the phone calls suck. They weren't as entertaining as yours. And guess what? It didn't. It went over like a goddamn lead balloon. It went over like a pregnant pole of all around a hot day in July and Vegas. And she's calling to share. See this is what I'm talking about in South Florida. This is what they want to share is their discontent. She's programming the show. Well, blow it out. You're nasty, smelly ass, honey. That's not satisfactory. That we go through all the work to put this stuff on a wet. She could read it on there. No. No, this is the show. It's just a backup to the internet. Whatever it all that means. Back it up to the door. So we'd art. And we can all take turns jamming our foot in it. How do you like that bitch? Sweet call. No, no seriously. How do you like her? Nasty, miserable, sour. Okay. The sour is mine. God, that was despicable. Stop being adolescent. It's an entertainment show on the OK. It's entertainment. It's kind of like since I stopped reading the bedtime story. That's when we started like, our app stuff I've been doing that for like a hundred years. Okay. Try to entertain the public. Give them a few laughs. I'm not going to save the world. You sound like you know that Georgian poppin O'Beechan. Maybe the two of you can a lope. Group and a lope. Maybe that was him. We're in the entertainment business. We're in the entertainment business. We want to be entertaining. I'm using a little bit informative. And I just got you talking about that very important story. I squeezed in yesterday. I read it a mile a minute, but it was an important story. And I got it in there. But I'm not going to sit in there. We crap all day every day. Read it on the internet. Sit there and prove it. Take a peek at it. And look at that. We're under 50%. Now it's down to 49.7%. So does that mean we're going to alienate another over 50%. I don't think so. See this way when you go to our website. It's sitting right there for you. You can you can use it for whatever you want. You can look at the bedtime stories. You can read some of them or all of them. You can look at the nasty pictures of all those poor. Among the children. You could read the poor result. You can vote on a pool. Maybe if you don't have a well. You can look at the. Tutsy pictures of Mo and guilty in the. The beast and clearance. You can use it for whatever you like. Use it and prove it. Or you lose it. Or you lose it. But we have a responsibility here. There are pants. Some of us a lot of money here to entertain a public out there. Which means I don't need any directions from you. Bitch. Slot. Oh, man. I want to say that. See you next time. So bad. You have no idea. If you look it up in this year. Her picture is next to it. Well, to the wake off real quick. I don't need to. 1041. Boy. What a shout. The right off to that. Second call to the box. Was that the second of the first call? Of the day. So once again, softloader continues just sending their worst. Just shove it in the. Then bother me. What you do sound much happy. Well, that's right. I'm much happier in the audience. It's much bigger in everybody's happy. We're going to tremendous response on our website. We don't find a problem at the moment, honey. Other than the fact that you got a real nasty attitude that you suck. You suck heavy duty. In fact, maybe the problem is you don't suck. That's the problem. What do you think? Oh, let's take a poll on it. Yeah, she needs a poll. 1042 at 560 WQM. But now you've been hearing about lamina terrasso. And how lamina would flow in from lamina terrasso is the easy.

So call lamina terrasso today be sure and tell that ancient nasty adolescent Neil Tertid call toll free, 1-877-773336. My and local year sports radio 560 suing, suing, suing, yeah. You're warm. I had a chip in pay when they she flew away to Tio and O'Reather, moon is blue. Love old shish, blue. But with our right wing censorship, there are words in muscle sling. To tell you how I feel for kids. That you didn't mind. So, as you see came in Tio and O'Reather, I'll see you with Tio and O'Reather too. You can wonder how this is decaying, seller, I'm a service day. And the SBC won't let me sing this song. I wrote today now, if this decay, take your hand. And you say that after this transmission, I'll be out in 90 days. Oh, we're just decaying here because you want to. I'll see you with Tio and O'Reather. Oh, what kind of Tio would Tio want to try? Please don't fade your voice. Wow, how about please don't fade your voice. That's fucking bitch. 560, 750, 560, 560, on the AT&T. I mean, just do the math, honey. That's one of everybody's favorite cliches. Do the freaking math. I'm looking at the pool, 51.7% say, oh, it's important to keep those bedtime stories on air. Absolutely. Right, which is fine. We enjoy it. We have a good time doing. We're spreading some opinion out there. We'd like to give the other sign as opposed to the vast majority of the media in this country. The right wing group balls. But that's 51% which means that 48.3%. Don't give a crap that much about it. How can we afford to blow off half of this audience? Just to make that bitch happy? Because that's really what it boils down to. Now, you gotta read those stories. You're gonna say, if the world and the alerts will be all won't. Not this adolescent juvenile stuff that you seem to like. Right out of the box, right from the get-go, right off the freaking bat. Why do I want to even take women call this? You know, we should just ban women from calling the show. We don't get that many anyhow. Right? Yeah. I mean, how do we, how many women call this show any year? About third man. Maybe if we're lucky. Take out the ones that are calling free loading. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let me give you the categories of women callers. Not that the matter, like, you know, because generally speaking, you know, I think it callers anyway. But women callers are in three or four categories. Number one, free loaders. Can I have the tickets? Can I have the tickets? Can I have free something? Then you got the bilingualism crowd. And so Florida, women callers. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Then we'd have one a year. Absolutely. Then we got the women like this bitch. Everything has to be what she wants. It's all gotta be heavy duty, politics. It's gotta be the Randy Rhodes. I'm gonna save the world from itself, I'll fall for Los Angeles. You know, that kind of crap. Wow. Yeah, forget about that. That's not what my audience wants. I mean, if you open up a restaurant, and 95% of your people want to have the cheeseburgers, but you're like spaghetti better and it come to find out that your neighborhood, nobody likes spaghetti. And you are insist on forceful and spaghetti instead of the cheeseburgers that they want. Guess what? You're gonna go out of business. You gotta give the public what they want sweet heart. Okay. So I've repeated it many times. Because I'm too worked up into a frenzy to read it right now and do it justice. Because for justice, for justice, we must trace that call and go to her house and just beat the snot on that bitch. I mean, she's just nasty. She's a nasty freaking bitch. If you don't like the way to show is, then go away. That's all very simple. Have a nice life. I don't wish you any yield. I mean, you have it a trip and break your neck. That's okay. But I don't wish you any harm or bad health. That's not the way it works. I see. Change it for me. So I gotta do what she wants. There you go. I gotta do it her way. I gotta sit her in read. Ponderous, ponderous crap. Hour after hour after. I like I started the sabie for you and erupted me. I interrupted myself. I couldn't believe the stack of crap. You can only imagine I'd start to show with each day. Just to make sure I didn't run out of course. Then I hit all the, all the tabloids, the inquirer in the star. All of that stuff to try to let it up a little bit. There's enough grief in the world. Just ask, be near boy. He'll tell you, there's enough grief in the world already. Without my sitting here and trying to get everybody depressed. This show and that's a one thing I'll again, here I'm pet myself and other shoulder. There are, I can't think of any other show ever on a radio. Or they actually did both. Where you could like try to entertain, do, you know, but I don't know what percentage. Heavy percentage of comedy and comedy bits and try to be lightened up. And also try to pass along some worthwhile information. Educate, entertain, whatever the hell it is we do. Just to guide the radio show. That's all. Infotainment. Infotainment very good. Not original but very good. Thought I didn't say what's. Oh, and I what is this that somebody just sent me? Where did this come from? Didn't come from you? I ain't factzing anything. I'm in the other world. Ex-trans overview report. I see this is all they care about. It's the WQAM. Not how did we do. It's not important that you succeed, but that your competitors fail. WRFX. And it's funny. This is right on the heels of the interview. They did with that obnoxious David Ross from Chief Channel a few days ago when I was down there. I never got around to reading that. Somebody facts it to me. About well, we found an opening there when the sports market and of course they have a talent on in midday who doesn't do a sports show. WRFX in his last in May of 2003. I want you to guess how many diaries reported WRFX. I want you to guess the number. I kind of already know. Oh, that's right. You facts this to me? No. Oh. The number starts with an engine. Oh. Zero point zero point infinity. None zero. Nice going David Ross. This to me is unprecedented. You should have thought of cartwheels in the hall yesterday. And again, keep in mind of Greg Reed had wild diarrhea for about two weeks when they first decided to turn that thing all sports. See all sports to begin with is a very, very, very narrow slice of the human pie out there. There's only a certain number of sport there. I want to see LeBron James picking his crotch on an NC and B.C. Although they probably get aroused by it. No, Clarence was all turned on by it. WRFX. I mean, they had. They had done the numbers. They did before were point three. What this is 12 plus. This is the whole audience. This is from birth to death. They have nobody listening based on this may report from arbitron. Did my fast machine just get jammed up or something or what? LeBron, please. Tha'e. I think there's more crap coming. Yeah, I was setting more stuff over. It's just, it's, it's, it's, uh, getting the crap. This, I would like to send us to PD Bulls your David Ross. Ronna Fink, audio assholes there at cheap channel, Lowry Maze, audio geniuses. Audio rocket scientists who thanks to your friends and thanks to your right wing friends and Washington are going to continue destroying this radio business that we used to know and love and enjoy. They take 940 on the Dalin and I'll say it again. I do have a bug up my ass because I used to work there. In fact, Moe, let me reach down a grab it. Oh, it's a bug. It's moving. 940, W-I-N-Z used to be. 50,000 watts in the middle of a dial. Great frequency, great tradition, great history. Once great ratings, once upon a time, when some of us worked there. And they've turned it into another sports nerd station that has no audience, not one diary, not a zero zippity duda, how do you like that? Stick it up your ass David Ross, you jack ass. Nice work. Another radio genius. And this is what Michael Powell and his Republican colleagues on the FCC have done, or what they're trying to do all of the Senate's trying to block it. Is give these people the opportunity to own more and more on newspapers, pretty soon, like in the spue they're right wing propaganda in every office in your body, because that's all you'll have. If you put a goddamn piece of toast in your pop-up poster, when it pops up, there'll be more right wing crap from cheap channel. And nobody is buying it. Nobody is eating it. Nobody is touching it. Nobody wants it. That makes me very pleased. 57 at 560 W-Q-M, you know, hurricane seasons here. That's not too pleasing.

Marlon's had sexist 35. And yeah, they're 500 for real, but they've been fed enough on the underlings on the wallers the match and the Tampa Bay Devil raise. That's all they play every day.

We had a whole bunch of calls on here and then they all vanished because this show is so They're important. We're going to save the world with it. They just ran away. What's going to be good? How do I know the bed? This call's going to be good. I don't know. Here's my any. Hello. I'm going to call and show you some. Call and show you a tire from can calling. Good. Okay. Goodbye. That's the same. Got a cousin line. I know. At least he called on for today. Goodbye. You know, this asshole, the one he also not only called twice yesterday, but facts as well.

So you don't have to answer the phone. I don't want you to. I don't want you to have an answer to phone in there. We're looking at all the great calls. We get on screenless. You get to talk a lot more people. They're busy. They don't have time to sit on hold in the goddamn heat. Okay. They're busy sitting out of the air. Can just try to get their breath back. Try not to suffocate. I'm a good one to talk man. 95. They're in a smog alert. A little toasty these next two days. 34 tomorrow, which is I think about like 94. But then back to 77 on Friday. Oh, you're in Tio. We got you beat. It's raining flaming meteors today. Again? Well, not yet. Oh, but it will be. It'll be pouring cats and dogs. You'll see. So here's how we want you to do the show. See it's the same thing with these cronics. Don't make up as we go along. It's the new Roger show. We decide. Me, George, Bina Boy. We decide what we're going to be doing on a show. We don't do it for the cronics. We don't need to your input like 80 times a day. If you're that much of a group, he's sit back. Do what we want you to do. Don't worry. We ask you to listen. Listen and enjoy it. Squeeze yourself. Have a great time. Squeeze your girlfriend, your boyfriend. Whatever. That's it. But don't try to inflict it. I mean, every one of the cronics. It's always been the deal that that misfit from forcing Lucy. All of them. Oh, but you're like turning on us. We love you. So, so fine. Just leave us alone. That's all. That's all we ask. Don't be chronic. Don't be obnoxious. Oh, but we like you so much. Stalkers. That's what most of those people are. They're like. Phone stalkers. Facts stalk. SIT is what they are stalkers in training. How would Brian Murray's pronounce that SIT? Should I do QIM? Yeah, I'll speak with a door to our neal. Okay. Is this your deal? This is your deal. I don't have a question for you. I don't know if you guys want to put it in there or not. And it's been driving me fat when you guys were discussing movies. Yeah. And once upon a time in America, what an old-fashioned thing. Oh, if we knew the answer that we wouldn't be sitting here. We'd be veeringers. How many really knows? No, well, I mean, you do. You don't know that James Woods got chopped up in the garbage truck. Right. The waste management dumpster too. Yeah. Right. Because that is special tonight's the go on dinner, some kind of a ward they gave him. Right. And every coast star that in the movie in each movie had a little of a net on it. And they did one of the long time in America, so whatever. And I'm afraid. I just like you. Okay. No. Not just like me. I was just curious about you. I need exactly what that was. And I'm glad you reminded me because a couple of weeks ago the directors cut the Whatever it is. The DVD came out and I forgot about that. So I have to pick it up today. I mean, it was a great movie. Be sure to the girl I never age. Just show. He's supposed to be 50 years older. Right. The ending was bizarre. Anyway, Neil, keep up the show and do it anyway you've done well, please. Thanks a lot, pal. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to watch the unended version of one of the last about seven to eight hours. Oh, God. And see what if I can figure out what it is. I don't know. I mean, if you see, one thing I've learned is that if you're going to ask, what is this movie all about? You're in for a lot of trouble. It's like a nightmare. Yeah. Magnolia. What's it all about? Well, I mean, that song is basically the essence. What did I do with those CDs? But CDs? Those but CDs. I think they're in Howard's. That's me. That's a movie. It's pretty CD. Hey, Howard went it out. Pick some out. All the crap you could unwrap. Yeah. You know, I thought you said there were sending me more of this stuff. Well, and I was going to have another crappy where facts in me that you're battling about. There's this button come from you anyway. Those are the only sheet. Those are the sheet clearance gave me. Oh, he gave you this. Yeah. Oh, my God. Clarence gave in this. So in other words, Clarence being the sports nerd. See, this ends the debate. And George already knew this. You had the right answer. He doesn't need sex. His life is sports. That's it. He's a sports nerd. Sports? Yeah. When a hurricane's win, whether it's football, baseball, he scores court in his pants. Okay. He has an orgasm in his pants. That's why he wears that rubber underwear. Oh, it's kind of hot this town here. Oh, seriously. Because he does a lot of that. Every time the dolphins wins, scores court. There you go. Oh, Clarence. He had ejaculated six times that in the fourth quarter. In his pants. Because that's it. That's his life is he's a silly person. He just I like him. He's a good guy. And it is payday. So that check better be there in my box. But other than that. So what does he facts one sheet from this, which is this is an extrapolation of the arbitron, the trend rating that came in yesterday, which we suck when. But WRF has like it. I said, not important that we did well, but that they completely fall on their ass. They did. You can just see Greg and Clarence running around on the hallway arm in arm. You know, you should have seen it. I'm sure of it. I'm positive. I don't have to be there to see it. I'm they running. They were doing hand springs and cartwheels. I mean, actually, when you look back to the winter book. And you look to March. I mean, how much and they had day parts where they had zeroes. Like March, seven to midnight, they had zero. And we're talking about persons 12 plus, which is the whole audience. We're not talking about some neuro demographic. We're not talking about 18 to 34 year old women who wouldn't listen to a sports station anyway. We're talking about the entire audience 12 to a million, even the morning show. Even at highly touted morning show, even with all our help, even the one that the crow is on now has got a big fat zero. That's a zero point. Oh, not a thing. I have never seen that in my life in the history of my freaking life. I've never heard of such a thing. Right. Maybe on some of these like penny adhesion brokers. I mean, keep in mind to give a thousands of diaries. So I mean, even if you suck when even if everybody hates your station, just by osmosis, some smock is going to say, oh, I listen to Fox Sports. I'll listen to that. You know, one. None. Zero. A clean sheet. That is just, I'm saving it. I'm putting that right. I'm talking to the thing that's got Moses home address on it. 560 50 50 50 50 60 on the AT and T and Verizon. I don't forget our big one to two hour today. We look forward to it every Wednesday. And we took a poll on that too. And you know, it was men's dementia. Come see. Come saw. We're doing okay with it. I like it. The audience seems to enjoy it. I like her. I like it. As a given the chance to listen to all types of ball games. WQAM. Nobody there in inpatient man. Bad sign. WQAM. Yes, sir. How are you? Great. How are you? The bush monster came on and admitted that he was a face man for Pinky, winky and foul well. And admitted that he was in the pocket of insurance companies. His approval rating was still be 68%. Thanks. Yeah. What happened in middle America was they care? If he admitted that he's teaching stuff for the war? No. They wouldn't even care. I don't understand it. I can't fathom it. In fact, one of the most grotesque stories. Was he the one we headed on yesterday? We got it on today about the poll about going to war in Iran. Fifty, fifty six to thirty eight percent American during favor of going to war to Iran. If that's what Curtis majority backs you. The force in Iran. Fifty six to thirty eight. The public endorses the use of military to block your end from developing nuclear weapons. So they've already basically told us they lie through their teeth. They're doing their own weapons and they're structuring their rack. Now they're singing a song about all Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And then fifty six percent still believe it? Well, they can come on in like I said, they can come on in a knit. We don't have anything but we just want to do it. And it wouldn't matter if they did these. Right. And the other thing is they keep talking about war. We're good at, you know, oh, firemen. The firemen so important to find them. Well, Rudolph had a work up to a garbage can and North Carolina for them to find them. Right. It's right. It was from some Bonnie five got a sound. That is correct. Hey, listen, what about the Ted Kizinski? If it wouldn't have been for his brother. If it wouldn't have been for that. And that letter in New York Times. Then everyone would have found him. Yeah, but they keep talking about war when we capture all the the deck of cards. We're going to have all these people consulting about everything. You know, as they keep moving the ball. Because they say, well, we have all the people in the scientist stock. Then we're going to know what weapons and the instruction. And all the people are and me want to have all these people at least the majority of them. And nobody's apparently said anything. Yeah. So, you know, they know they're totally incompetent. It's just, you know, the people just don't think in this country. They don't have a crap. They're busy waiting for American Idol. And, you know, who's there when the goddamn ball game? Have a great day, pal. Thanks, pal. See. He's forgot to stumble right on him, man. 56 to 38. This is the latest pool. Just came out. Washington Post ABC News pool. Back, the government going into Iran. If that's what it takes to keep Iran from developing nuclear arms. Oh, my god. What, what, what, this guy's got to stumble right on it. What does it take to convince the American public? Because they're stupid, you know, most people are stupid. Iran, Iraq, Syria. They wouldn't know where to find him on a, you know, got to get a search part. He got to get modesty on his hand in it. See if he can find it. Maybe that's what he's looking for. Maybe he's looking for those weapons of ash destruction. You think? 560. How's the pool come? We need 50% bonus boy. Or your efforts are going to be, that would be a real shot in the head. When you take that personal. Very. I would. I'd be, I'd be offended and wounded after all the hours that I've spent digging out those sea stories. 314 votes should Neil keep posting the bedtime stories on the website. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Hey, there we go. Hey, y'all, my name is France, the Eugene Thomas, Festival's just nominee for the Supreme Park. And you know, there's lots of people's identity, think just cause I'd smoke a little marijuana when I was in college. Yeah, they weren't nothing but a pin joint. Yeah, maybe sing our sign, y'all. I know the real name we are. Didn't they don't think I'm fit to be on the Supreme Park? Yeah, I got too much. That's who this quick and get out of here. I want to sit down straight. When I'm stop reviewing the law, I don't just review the law. Tell y'all. I mean, token. And I don't get to the East. I don't get to the West. I get on token by now. Look up, send a deal, kind of. Let them. I'll be token. Ha ha ha. Let's go very well, y'all. So I'm a Marine Dowd license that he's New York Times. Here you go. I'm sure now you know she's still listening, right? Oh, yeah. She's got that thing cranked up real real loud. In fact, she's probably got the radio right between her knees now. Point down one of my favorite favorites. Rights could Thomas be rights, big and a clearance Thomas. She says, what a kind of man clearance Thomas is. He knew that he couldn't make a powerful legal argument against racial preferences. Given the fact that he got into the year law school and got picked for the Supreme Court. Thanks to his race. So he made a powerful psychological argument against what the British call, positive discrimination known here as affirmative action. Justice Thomas's descent in the five-before-decision preserving affirmative action and university admissions has persuaded me that affirmative action is not the way to go. The descent is a clinical study of a man who's been driven barking mad by the beneficial treatment that he's received. It's poignant, really. It makes him crazy that people think he is where he is because of his race, but he is where he is because of his race. Other justice is relying clerks and legal footnotes to help with their opinions. Justice Thomas relies on his id, turning an opinion into on race into a therapeutic outburst. In his descent he's slightly dismisses the University of Michigan's law school's desire to see minority faces in the mix as racial aesthetics, given the effort to balance bigotry and social in the moral way to be a better than that. The phrase racial aesthetics would be more appropriately applied at WD's nominating convention in Philadelphia when a republicans put on a minstrel show for the white fat cats in the audience. Justice Thomas coined affirmative action as a fattest slogan of the cognacent, quoting Frederick Douglass on the Negro 140 years ago here, just all I ask is give him a chance to stand on his own legs, let him alone. Your interference is doing impositive injury. He is at the pinnacle African-American who succeeded in getting past the immediate Hill sexual harassment scandal by playing the race card, calling the hearing a high-tech lynching, and who got a million and a half dollars advanced to write his African-American Horrace-O-Aldrace story from pinpoint to points after. So why despite his racial blessings as he come across as an angry bitter self-pitting victim? It's impossible not to be disgusted at someone who could benefit so much from affirmative action and then pull up the latter after himself, so maybe he's disgusted with his own great historic ingratitude. When he switched from a Democrat to a conservative, as a young man, he knew that he'd be a hotter commodity in politics, but he also knew that it would bring him the scorn of blacks who deemed him as a pawn of the white establishment. People like Justice Thurgood Marshall, the ridicule, Clarence Thomas, and others as God damn black sellouts for benefiting from affirmative action and then denigrating it. As Jill Abramson and Jane Meyer writes in Strange Justice, Mr. Thomas himself complained in 1987 and has speech that, to what acceptance and conservative ranks, a black was required to become a caricature of sorts, providing side-shows of anti-black quips and attacks, just as blonde conservative pundits flash long legs and sneered feminism. When the 43-year-old was nominated by Bush 41 with the preposterous claim that he was the best qualified man for the job, GOP strategist, averated attention away from the judges' scant credentials, and controversial record by pushing his inspiring life story, grants out of a share-cropper and son of a judge woman who picked a meat out of crab shells. But it's as if Justice Thomas has been swallowed by his own personal grammar, just as Bob Dol and Bob Currie were swallowed by the gripping personal grammars on the presidential campaign trail. Mr. Thomas is so blinded by his own autobiography, he can no longer focus on bigger issues of morality and justice, having used his personal story to get on the court. He's now left to worry that his success is not personal enough. President Bush, the Yale legacy who also distains affirmative action, is playing affirmative action politics in the preliminary vetting of a prospective Supreme Court nominee, Alberto Gonzalez. No doubt Bush 43 will come Mr. Gonzalez, the best qualified man for the job, rather than the one best qualified to help harvest the 2004 Hispanic vote. President Bush and Justice Thomas have brought me around. I don't want affirmative action. I want whatever they got. That's what Marine Dowd said. If it is New York Times, stick that in your pipe and smoke it. Okay. Put that in your income. Pull it out, Mo. Okay. Absolutely. Good. Hope you enjoy it. You know, most slogan. All the crap you could unwrap. That's it. Isn't that a great line at last line at that, sir? I wasn't that Bush and Justice Thomas have brought me around. I don't want affirmative action. I want whatever they got. Oh, what a great line Marine. She's the best. See, there's another thing about that bitch that called and got us off to a really sour start today. I'd rather hear the retired. I'd rather hear that guy. You know, at least he's almost, I'm not a musing, but yeah, I don't know this something about him. I think that's him though. He said him online. I don't know. Retire line. Hello. Brilliant article by Moorin Dowd. She's great. You're a writer. And hits everything right on. He excuse me the head. Two things. First of all, I just recently got done reading blinded by the right and lightning and disturbing all rolled up into one. Second thing is, I don't know if you discussed this already, if I'm rehashing and I apologize. I'm keeping my speaking of blinded by the right, keep in mind that now that David Brock has a scene at least we can sleep easy and night knowing that there's always a misgrudge there to replace him. Oh, absolutely. Would you even more disturbing this thing? The, the whole incident yesterday in Good Morning America with the encolter. Did you hear him? I don't see it. I didn't hear about it. Oh, yeah. Apparently she got up there. Diane Sawyer was interviewing her because they had called to run a new book which apparently she, she goes out of her way to commend Joan McCarthy and talk about how he was just absolutely right and doing what he did. Lovely. But nevertheless, Diane Sawyer said something to her about the fact that you're going to be going head to head on the best seller was with Hillary Clinton and Colter said, I hope so. She said, I'm going to win because I have a, or she has a three to one pound advantage over me. And normally Sawyer is pretty flappable and she said, what did you say? What I think you just said. And you know, basically sat there and called her fat and pissed off a lot of fat. Yeah. Yeah. Viewers, for the show, somebody even wrote in, I'm reading this off the MSNBC's website actually. That somebody wrote in and said that the encolter is appearing on the view today and what's just see if she makes a come in from the start. Oh, yeah. Well, happy. Well, at least you get up and beat the crap out of her. And you know what? As much as I can't stand star Jones, I would actually tune in to see that happen. I pay money to watch her lay that bitch out. Oh, that makes do of us. That's it. Thanks a lot, Palli. I already. See you. Excellent. How do you like that? So there you go. On one hand, we had a good call with a guy like, you know, he didn't carry on for a long period of time. He said, is peace knee a guy out here. Had something to say as opposed to the other bitch who didn't really have anything to say, I've been to tell me how to do the show. We don't take instructions on how to do the program. If you like it, listen, suck it up. The price is right. It's free. If you don't like it. Have a great life. We wish you nothing but the best. Maybe a couple of car racks along the way.

I realize that's probably silly talk and some Florida. But whatever makes you reasonably happy. Everything being relative the way it is. See what I'm saying? What a great deal. Good.

But we're here to like get and by the way, Clarence, since you're so whipped up into a frenzy in your squeeze in your little tiny penis all about Fox News didn't have it in him. And you've got the extra and extrapolation here. How come we can't have some stuff about our station? Wouldn't that be nice? That might be useful to us to give us a. You know, we went down. QAM in his trend. I mean, I realize it was a heavy, spongebob month. Okay. Big deal. But nevertheless, we went down. I mean, when Howard sperm goes down a month and a half, he realized that our kind of radio is zero and when the other sports station gets no diaries, it wasn't in the car. It's for us to do well at month. But instead of reveling so much in the other guy had no diaries, how about taking a look at what we did, Clarence? Huh? I just mentioned that in passing. Why do you squeeze in yourself? I'm going to give him that picture of you in the beast on the website. It is a lovely. And, and speaker, that, why don't we go to get the other one. A colorful one of being a by the way under a lot of stress. The wedding picture. Don't go pile and down. Why not? Why not? Why not pile it on? That's a loony. John Moyers is editor in chief of Tompane.com and rights. Oh, I'm going, I'm going to squeeze myself on. I read these words. George W. Bush is a liar. I said that the L word someone a Washington had do. Thanks to A.W.W.M.D. people all across America have the L word on their lips, but here in D.C. it's still a hard one to mouth. Few Washington-based commentators and fewer politicians have done so. On Sunday, June 22, the New York Times had a chance to be the first big league out bid to say it plainly. But the headline on Washington-based reporter David E. Rosenbaum's story. Bush may have his ever exaggerated, but did he lie? Was it that the story would pull up short? Rosenbaum considered a narrow question, whether Mr. Bush has told any neat, tidy, obvious lies, and concluded he is not a couple of Fives in Distortion, maybe but no lies. Whether the President twisted intelligence at WMD can probably be answered conclusively, only by historians when all the evidence and consequences are known Rosenbaum wrote, so our kids get to pay the debt of our imperial aspirations and our tax breaks, and someday they'll be the first to know how it all happened. Distance seems to make criticism easier. The Times Princeton-based columnist Paul Crockman has written that the administration systematically and brazenly distorts the facts and is choosing and exaggerating intelligence and misleading the public, close but still no L-word. Boston-based William Rivers' pit isn't dotted. The administration lied us into a war-writes-the-high-school teacher whom one might as a comment for truth out.org. Trust a teacher on this, we can spot liars who haven't done their homework a mile away. A full page ad on New York Times-lifeweek by moveon.org and WMDWMD members across the nation put it plainly in voice to the President on his own pointed WMD words of mass distortion. Under the headline, Miss Leader, the ad stacked up five of Mr. Bush's P. War Woppers and noted, it will be a tragedy if young men and women were sent to die for a lie. Full disclosure, Tom Paine.com liked the ad so much we paid to run at this week in the weekly standard. Harley-Sorenson, writing on SFgate.com gets the prize for directness. Why mince words? These are the facts. One, President George W. Bush's a liar, two Secretary of State Colin Powell is a liar, three Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is a liar, four National Security Advisor, Combellies, Arreys' a liar, no mince in there. So the word is out there in different forms lies, lies, lying, liar. When will Mr. Bush pute the de-apponents of the government that Democrats decide it's time to tell it like it is? Democrats have accused the president of a pattern of deception and deceit Senator Bob Graham, said he's not been entirely truthful, Howard Dean, and led us to war based on unfounded assertions represented Dennis Cassinat, strong stuff that still no ill word. Opposition worthy of the name would push the GOP control housing senators' beyond the question of what the intelligence community knew about WMD, where it seemed stalled. Senator J. Rockefeller, the ranking Democrat on the sentence intelligence committee, and invoke committee rules that would allow his minority party to launch a full investigation, but he won't, reportedly, for fear of being seen as partisan. If this isn't the time for partisanship, after while we're talking about manipulations that led the nation into war, what is? Rockefeller's timidity is allowing committee Republicans to cover what looks more everyday like a lie of literally global magnitude, perhaps Democrats feared that they went WMD or found and they will be found by Hooker Crook. But they needn't worry, even if his lead in the nation to war weren't an issue, Mr. Bush's record is full of lies. The president says he supports our troops, but he proposed cutting veterans benefits in size stepped along meant to protect the health of soldiers headed for combat. His lead no child behind pledges of fraud, he's vastly underfunded his own education plan, and he signed the recent text to leave an after GOP minn and sneakily removed provisions benefiting low income families. Mr. Bush says he's co-a-compacient conservative, but only a hard-hearted radical would push his Robin Hood and reverse tax policies. He says he wants to expand national service programs, but he's presiding over a huge cut in AmeriCorps programs. Candidate Bush promised to be a United out of the divider, but his foreign policies have profoundly divided the international community isolated American divided her stock in the eyes of the world. Mr. Bush's administration is built-on lies, which means the grand daddy of the mall is to promise to restore honor and integrity of the awful office. Presidential brain Carl Rove must be worried. Rove knows that any president's popularity rests more on whether voters think he's a believable and admirable leader than on the substance of issues. George's W. Bush has that going for him. People might not like his policies if they understand him at all, but they like his swagger and certitude and they trust him to do what he says. But that trust could crumble if questions linger about whether the White House deceived us into war. Few of the president's allies could have would defend that even GOP TV aka Fox News would have trouble explaining away that one. Outstanding article by John Moore is editor in chief of Tompane.com.

It's a clean swing. 5.6. Oh, 5.6. 5.6. Did I mention anything about Tony Blair? Although I don't like him. But that mention anything about him. No. In other words, I don't agree with you. And I express my opinion. How do you like that asshole? But I'm expressing my opinion. I'm not a goose pepper. I'm not stepping in a line. And I'm also when I read these bedtime stories reading the opinions of many, many other people, not just yours truly. Who are offended and that's find it up not just this is a matter of fact speaking of a very else your own. I wasn't even going to dig in with this. This is when it was on our website the other day. Howard was digging into it this morning? Rectom. All the crap you could unwrap. Netanyahu says your rack is really oil line. We'll open a near future. Remember we had that right on the heels of the initiation of this so-called a rack attack? Yes, you did. Is really finance minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Boy. Another one I don't like by the way. Add that to your listener. Another right wing zealot. City expected an oil pipeline from Iraq to Israel to be re-opened in the near future after being closed when Israel became a state in 1948. It won't be long when you'll see the Iraqi oil flowing to Haifa. The port city in northern Israel Netanyahu told a group of British investors to climb to give a time table. It's just a matter of time until the pipeline is reconstituted in Iraqi oil will flow into the Mediterranean which is exactly the story that we had back at the time. What are the reasons why we went in their fourth-futthas bogus war against nobody, basically? And why people are still dying there every day are people. And the Brit people. 567. Oh, so you don't like this one. You're a moron, sir. You're an imbicil. Okay? Don't confuse you with the facts. WQAM. Hi, Neil. Hi, are you doing today? Oh, sir. I got a little bit of a breaking news for you. Breaking news. Wait a minute. Here we go. As I was flipping it in my cable, too. Yes. I came across these bands where they were debating and approved a congressional metal of honor for Tony Blair for his unwavering support of the United States. Great. Isn't that something? Boring. It's incredible. Yeah. Thanks for the band, those values spoil my day. Thank you. If you don't like Tony Blair, not enough because he's a sellout. Because I'm sure that they must be naked pictures of him in Prince Charles or something. Or a big bag of money. Or maybe just a big sack of cash that might be it for just a sack of crap. 50. A 1.7% on most bedtime stories Carlos don't work too favorously on air. Now because if it drops under 50% we're just we may be allowed. We may be allowed on a whole thing. A lot of work, especially for Carlos who's who's who's who's who's who life is a lot of work. Getting out of bed in the morning is a lot of work. Getting to work is like an almost impossible task now. Eating breakfast. Just suck in that free bacon up a little bit. Even that's become a gigantic major chore for this sad sack of ours now. So the idea that he's going to spend 15, 20 whole bunch of hours every day. About 10 minutes. Work in feverishly to put this information on air for a bunch of simple. I don't know. We'll find out. We'll see just how feverishly they feel about this. WQIM. Any other day. Pretty good sir. I don't know what anybody has against the bedtime stories. I mean I don't have time to go scaring the internet. Look at first stuff and look at for the truth. Which apparently we don't get here and I don't get the what is the CBC is what you get up there. Yeah. Right. So it's this good. I know I can't vote on the poll because I have AL blow. Oh God. I'm not going to do it. I'm switching anyway so the hell with them. Neil, real quick question. On the best of CBCs. Are you going to have any anger Anderson bits on there? I don't know. Are you going to put any of those on there? Sure. Why not? You have a bullet on there just for you. How do you like that? For the one to two hour. Can you place them in grandnastien like the anocornic over one? I'm losing. Those in my thing here. There should be some in there. Under what? Yelling guy. Oh and that's right. They're under the yelling guy. Yeah. Because I know who you're talking about but I know what we have. One moment please sir. I love it. We got a man.

Yeah long time ago Didn't have like a lot of nuts. It does have nuts. Oh and new get new nuts and new get what a great combination In fact, maybe nuts and new get is what mow is picking out of the vacuum He's just nuts about new get Why I'm seriously that is so I'm trying not to think of it because it's been close to the end of the show last time, you know Oh boy, it's there. It's been so hard not to think about the thought of watching mow walking around wondering around the bullpen there with his hand deep in his lime green pants Ticking a godowing knows what out of his ancient And this isn't just from for real we know is a sick bastard for from a whole bunch of people who are screaming in a Hull this morning just to freak out we will get a picture then and that when he went around trying to shake everybody's hand I think that was a little over the edge just over the top of lifting his fingers Don't you Q a m Hey Oh, WQ a Oh boy, we're gonna have a good hour.

I hope that I hope to people put it over the top because they help me out without You know surfed around and going crazy They're actually I thought it was a magnificent service on our part for those of us who are to the left of it Tell of the haunted would like a little bit different You know perspective a much lower-end of world and the prices right. It's absolutely free We don't charge for it, but only 51.4% right now, which isn't exactly overwhelming Not only that at least that I discovered Some of the websites common dreams of whatever right which is great. I do not ask you this. I look to your movie list Watched wrecking for dream How was that movie about what is it about it's about addiction and now right? It's so The music the pace it's really it's kind of difficult to digest I was watching it as gold I was waiting for something. It's supposed to watch it not eat it Correct, but I guess I was expecting something a little bit more in the way it ended one of those endings where you go what the? You do You do go that I don't think so I know what more did you need to see I mean you could have seen her a little bit later on when she was like an emergency death Well with the support today I figured how I think they would sort of tie everything together Either the kid would come back or or Yeah, what happened with the girl? What was it? No, I know this scene now you're sending like George with this critique of Magdoddy He did like the ending movies don't tie up everything with a nice bow on it to the end I mean at maybe a year ago they did that but that's ancient they just don't do that Movie makers now they give you like a wild story and all sorts of different things going on and then that's it There has to be a point at which they say okay, we what did you appetite now you figure out what how you? What you got out of it? Is that the conclusion you came to with vanilla sky the same kind of No I that's that's another word ending that didn't really No, it didn't but that was different Yes, but I mean I was other than last you come a whole I mean what movie had an ending that the even the Hitchcock movies is great as many of them were Just about everyone that I can think of and it would like a you know happy ending and Grace Kelly ran off with What's his name with Harry Grant or even Marie St. you know any that went off and we're getting married and everybody Happy ending after all the wild adventures on my worst more whatever you know You know that's true like I guess You can fit they just don't do that anymore now. It's a little more esoteric and We've identified they all hit rock bottom at the same time Okay, let me ask is there difference to the one I got that added it's a difference between Added it in a where did you get that sir? That's one of the video places. How do you know you got an ended one? Yes, that's added it on the box that it is first don't ever do that again Okay, if you if they you pick up one that says edited throw it near face Say I want the real one or else I'm getting out of here.

It just dawned on me here During this last break It just dawns on me. Why is it that she's listening to the show? Since she doesn't like what we do and she is interested in the bedtime stories Why doesn't she just go on our website for free and read them at her leisure? Wow what a concept but you see that would take out the bitching and moaning part Yeah, yeah, and then she just can't be a woman She just can't be a woman unless he's bitching and belly it can And it's just not good enough for her. That's not a matter of heart Don't you know that women believe that they can make a bad situation better by bitching I see they're helping by doing that also in other words. He was bitching yeah Then see her is this still the uh, this is still the same Stuff we had on yesterday is being a blanket and any making any progress today He's in the on our website. Yeah, box on all of loaded again. I thought There should have been half of them should have been up already Let me this all looks like old still a stay and on the day when we're taking a poll about the new stories on our website about the bedtime stories This looks old and ancient everyone leads to me sabotage Get out of here. What do you mean sabotage The road to cover up is the road to ruin. That's that's uh ancient story I said it a Robert bird that was his other comments. Huh, that's one of the ones that got today That's one of the ones from today. Yeah, like I said it's from earlier in today. It's old like him No, maybe that is new. Okay.

I would fax some new I might have to like try a couple of times there on a weekend 11 o'clock in the morning to fax you the stories Because your computer might might be turn on yet You might be in jail whatever would be but generally speaking it was like automatic like falling out of the sack like picking the seeds out of mosaics But now Now it's turned out to be like a major project. Maybe it's propitious Maybe it's propitious that we're doing the survey today on this because it's a certainly propitious me off It will be again. It will be as it was. Yeah Well, I sure hope so because the ball isn't your court anyway. You're gonna be responsible most of these days once so that once that big day comes up next week That was Tuesday July first is not Canada today. It's a holiday.

Okay, and it's fast me that stuff He's getting a real real sore about back them Even the beast was grossed out By Mo and in fact, I think I have it on tape here somewhere Maybe we'll play the whole the whole beginning there.

It's epic ponderous, but movies should end How ever I want to end they shouldn't now that doesn't mean you're gonna like the way they always end, but we shouldn't have a set Platform and life they used to like like I said even the hitchcock movies. I can't think of one of them that had an unhappy ending Can you no In the apartment everything was fine and it was always a male star carry grant or Jimmy Stewart It was Grace Kelly even where he's saying the tipy heaven and in the end Everything now and I wait a minute. I'm trying to think back to the birds. How did the birds in? Kind of yeah, you know words it was the birds is the one exception because it seems to me They just got on the highway and they started driving off and the birds were like attacking everywhere So they drove off and no one said you're waiting for that that was possibly like really a bit of iconic wait a minute The birds were just sitting there so the implication is that they get away What are you talking about in the birds will be mobile movie did you watch the birds and At the end of the movie they get in the car and they drive off and like the reports are coming in from all over the guy They in place and they drive away to get out of there and but they don't know what is waiting for them But the birds were just sitting around and kind of like let them go Those were just the San Francisco birds all I was We're not talking about the second or the red birds Here's another fact.

It's there it is 50.9 Hang on on you if it's under 50% we just very well may This continue the effort because it's just didn't really worth it. You know for a small handful What are you laughing about his cry? Oh, I said we very well made now That does me we will I'm not I can know promises here.
