Ortingale. Moran's got. So what was their big rock and roll concert that kept everyone up all night in Toronto? So Beterbor City really enjoyed the tube stick at your birthday party, it was great. Yeah. And as a barbecue sauce, she said, really was the fine touch. That worked for him so well. It was unbelievable. You had 37,000 people there, which was nice at the ballpark. That was nice. Yeah, I would be the in the tea train and all this other crab, all of her running phones. Yeah, they could have had a... They didn't have as much fire as me seeing. And a big hairy ass mop, and I could have said, wow, I want to, you would have loved seeing this concert here last night because CBC and all their glory. I'm like the American at worst. CBC doesn't censor anything. So when he brought the side to start taking her tops off. Yeah. Because the first time I saw it, you would have just flipped out. There was this unbelievable blonde, and she's like, from the waist up and totally naked as a jibber, except for her nipple rings. Yeah. And I thought boy, somebody some director's going to he can't put him out on the air. And like two minutes later, they show her again and they focus them like for five seconds. You got to be with me. You should have seen that crowd man. I have him made an almost naked, beautiful, unbelievable, perfect. A headline in a paper show this morning is one of the best commenters. It says, like Woodstock run by the Swiss. That sounds the crowds decidedly, really. There were no fights, no gunshots, no stabbing. No crap, nothing. Have him ended people and just had a great time. That is crazy. And it was what the Rolling Stones and ACBC and the BBC. What was? First guess who and a best part of the whole night was one of the performers that got to it up on stage and in withdrawing water bottles at him. Guess what was? Justin's family's little Justin, take her bow. I would say invite that fam. Now in fact, his, his, his, his comment was his comment was I felt a little that out of place with all the little bit like what the whole thing done. Yeah, what a, you're right. He's a little fan of the, after watching him last night and then seeing him speak. These are little screamer. Carlos, what's that? It's not the end of the pathetic, the way they command you fact your all these romance. I'm not going to have, if they're going to hook Brittany up with somebody, hook her up like a real guy, not some little food fly. You know what I had Carlos doing, different handshakes with guys nuts. Who was he? You, you look up the expression, Schmidt faced in the dictionary. You'll see Carlos's post right next to it. I think you're website. That's what your website is. He's, uh, I'm going down and obviously the, Mozo is the best, but I love when I see that picture of you as Bruce Lee. That is, that tells me with a non-shox. I just, I tried to tell that it was Mo who was attacking from the rear. Yeah. You couldn't fool him because he said it was no dingleberry. So he knew what wasn't wrong. Or rather new contest now on the Ferals show. If that's what you want to call it, the program in the morning, who takes more vacation days, Mo or God. And I mean, you're going on another one like next week, right? I'm going on one like the afternoon. Where are you going? I'm going back to Amsterdam again. Give another try. Yeah, bring the Beast back some reaper, right? Give it another shot. I'm being in Breck. I got your dits already. I'm shopping at the brick. I'd have a, have a great day now. Thanks God, have a great vacation now. Don't fall asleep on a boat at 9 p.m. with any boy with a big ass around. Or we'll be able to hold sandalsmith face for me. I got you covered. Little barbecue sauce with your breakfast. He said it tasted like barbecue sauce. I'm 100,000 people man. Just dabbing. No shootings. A great time was head by all except for them just now. He's good.

Only he wasn't funny. Anyway. Oh, we got some bad news to get started. I don't want to start on a sour note because we got so many good things going on. Including the half of many people in the last night. Let me see it again. Woodstock. Woodstock run by the Swiss. What a good headline. I love that. I mean, it's an old line. It's just like that line about if you woke up with Vaseline on your. I mean on your hands. What? Or anyway. In your case it was both. No, seriously. He had Vaseline on his. Back home. And on his face. Now maybe you're a contortionist. Maybe in a moment of infohirance. Maybe you able to like do a wrong Jeremy and own. I love he or double-join it. They flipped them over. The crowd turned him over. Yeah. For round two. I hurt him. He was a real headturner with the party. Is what I heard. Something about him. I mean, a picture. I think the picture. The ash in the face. Pails in with significance about the guy. Who's about to open his fly. Who's standing on his way from Carlos's. Plus that's the one that leads to that father. That might bother you just a little bit. Okay. Wow. It felt like barbecue sauce running down his chin. And anyway. Wait. We have a phenomenal response yesterday on it. Not to on the pole. The full sucked of course because this sort of just pull. But on the website because everybody want to see those pictures from Carlos birthday bash. And especially they want to see beiner boy that take a little ass in the face. It was. Well, but I'll still call it. I mean, I was almost. Excuse me. Taking a big ass in the face, man. And the best part of his before the show. He admitted this morning. He liked it. He was a little bit in coherent, but just just has enough memory to remember. He enjoyed it a lot. Bad news. Record producer Sam Phillips dead at 80. Oh, that's bad news. No Sam Phillips. Yeah. We knew it was coming up. Why do we know that? We were sick. What sick? Yeah. Well, Bob Hope was sick for a long time. Look how long he held on. Man. Just refused to go. Some records found your Sam Phillips who decided that had been unknown. Elvis Presley deserved a recording contract when he heard him sing. Sox for his mother has died. He was 80. You know, 80. You sounds like, well, that's pretty old. But to me, it's like, oh, that's not so old. Tomorrow. Yeah. When I first heard him Elvis, the essence of what I heard in his voice was such that I knew there might be a number of areas we could go into. Phillips once said, just like they got was in the pictures with Lena Boy. There are a number of areas he was planning to go into. You're never going to live that down. Now, that's that's a legacy that will last you a lifetime. And believe me on this show will make danger that it does. Oh, God. People show me it just so you know. Yeah. Putting that as their wallpaper on the computer is up around. Excellent. Okay. I can't get away from it. Everybody. The invite to web be nice if you like wash your mouth off a little bit. Phillips, the record producer helped us. You're the rock and roll bar pollution died Wednesday. A respiratory failure at St. Francis Hospital. And Memphis Tennessee is some Knoxville upset. He said his father been into climbing health for a year. The older Phillips founded some records in 1952, how to launch a career of Elvis that a young singer moved from Tupel, Mississippi. And the summer of 53, Presley went to the Sun Studio record two songs for his mother's birthday. Phillips noticed him on for a pressly recording contract. Phillips produced the pressly's first record, 1954 single that featured that's all right. Mama and Bluewood a Kentucky nine more. I've had those here somewhere. So San Phillips is dead. That's bad news from some records. He was a pioneer. Change the face just like that asked the decarals. Change the face of rock music forever. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Back home. Oh, he has face man. God. Let's see. I've got to do that Hillary program today. We've got to give the results from your pool. We have a George bashing pool today. And George said to me before to show why you've bashing me. The message. Just don't know why. Why is that? Because I ripped that poll building show you did the day before. You did. I've made mention of it. What was that? I said that they're getting to be like give away shows. You just hear the same thing every time we do a poll building show. No, but that was a good poll about the rock wood. But they never understand the question. So they just call up with names. They just throw names out and it gets old. I didn't think your eyes thought was pretty damn good. Listen, most of those people don't have anything to say. But I guess you haven't figured it out yet. I figured it out. So you give them their moment in the line right like that. They just the bird out of name or a ward or a phrase or something. You know, like a cry. I know an answer to a question. Meanwhile, I'll tell you why we enjoyed who I like a lot of Sam Roberts. Oh. You don't know from Sam Roberts it's a Canadian group. No, not just a guy. It's a group. They have worth the concert. And I'll tell you who was. Right. I'll say I don't want to sound negative because there was nothing negative about it. It was just great. And even though the stones look like they're about 95. But it's a guess who, which is certainly one of my top favorite three or four groups of all time. There isn't a bigger guess who fan in the world. I don't think at a bigger Burton coming Spain. Did I always say that he may have had the greatest voice of anybody in the world? You said that and I won't argue many times. And that's in past 10. Now they did do taking care of business, which your course wasn't there song in the first place. But they did do and of course the crowd went nuts when they did that. They did a really rousing version of that. But when they were doing their own songs, it was so obvious to me that Burton coming just he and Academy, where he's lost that voice, that fantastic thing. And when they sang no time, he was like squealing. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's sad. No time. I mean, it was just a... I'm not. I mean, nothing is perfect and it was phenomenal and sensational. And this city is magnificent, it's incredible. But like I said, he used to be great. Of course he's only about what 90. Right. Okay, we'll get to the results of your really embarrassing pull. By the way, that's one of the oldest lives in history. Adam on being a boy to feel like George was that creative about that. If you woke up after a party with Vaseline on your ass, would you tell him, that's older than the Thuslan. In fact, I think the Thuslan was probably the worst part of it. It worked up with Vaseline. He mentioned it on his ass. He mentioned the whole of the voice. But I just saw the pull and I thought, here we go again with that anal business again. If it's not eating ass, it's Vaseline in the ass. And of course, well, this one tried to incurred events. When I was opening up his fly there and I won picture, I caught you up all sorts of things after he heard about the report on Venus. Welcome. Twelve minutes after 10 at 5. 60 W.

Ten 18 at five, 60, or people probably think it's a real spot, you know? Yeah. That's an honor of whole Smithface down there, who's there, and obviously a hell of a time. Somebody sends me a fact saying, 50 Internet, it's down. The Internet's free, he's down. The Internet's free means down. I have to notify, watch the Tommy notified, the engineering department, and they are working feverishly on it. The day that that engineering department works feverishly on anything. The day of the cool day in hell, okay? So, we're not streaming an audio right on the Internet, and you do understand that this is another way the QM continues shooting itself in a foot. Every time we build up this moment, I mean, for real is so hot, he's like, you can't even touch him, you know, even if you wanted to, which I don't. But he's, he's hot on a firecracker right now. And we got to his Marling Game, I guarantee you that the 37,000 people are last night. 20,000 were there for Don Trell and the other 17 were there because of all the hype that for else me given. You believe that? Yeah, sure. Just pretend you believe it. But seriously, he's going to have like double digits in the next trend. And then of course, then then it's really going to become glaring, you know, because that last the book, which that got thrust by the way, but that book, there was no way reflection of him because he had been on long enough. Right. But we'll only get to July trend out. Do we have any idea when it is, August? What? Yeah, this is an argument. Yeah, and the August. And then you're going to see the morning go shooting up and somebody's not, and we can't get the hour by hour during the trend. So somebody, of course, for three months will have the opportunity to come back and do it. Yeah, the thing that it's in ratings don't count. But then when the whole summer book comes out, we get the hour by hour. And you see that all of the forward motion is going to be 8 to 10 a.m. And that six to eight is going to be continued to be just deadly. Then then we'll separate the real broadcaster from the wannabes. Okay, from the crusty old assholes. Speaking of crusty assholes, George S. yesterday. If you woke up after a party with Vaseline on your ass, would you tell anyone? I took one look at that pool and I said, there he goes again. Right, though, Mr. Ass. Ass George a question, have you been to an assor? If you woke up after a party with Vaseline on your butt, would you tell anybody no, no, on 519, when's the party? 160, 3. I bet you've been her voter for that. Does he get into it now? Who's going to be at this party, 80? I certainly thought it was my vote. That's what I voted. Who's going to be a different person? It doesn't make a decision if you don't. That definitely makes a difference. It's like optimistic or whether you're like terrified. It doesn't matter. Only my close friends, 57. And yes, I tell everybody 56 real perverse. The girls say, all right. The girls that he'd take out an ad in papers. Yeah, he's full of crap. Isn't that a closet, a spectacles all he is? No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm getting a thousand phone calls saying the internet is working. So I don't, and that it's been working the whole day. Yeah. Well, how are we going to know? I don't know. Well, who told you that it was down? Just that facts? No, no. There was like five different people I called and people were fact seeing and people in the building Couldn't I go to the party? Let me take care of my, let me take care of this very important call from Pompano, because you know, who's going to be here's Pompano, hello. Hey, hey, hello. It's not him, yes sir. Yeah, sir. I'm just going to remind you that, you know, I'm just messing with you. You didn't even start a drug and all. And how come you've become decaying all of a sudden? Well, that's an excellent question now that you mentioned it. How come do they can't become? Well, you know, the plaques you really can't create it for rock and roll. Who? Who should take credit? The plaques they stole. Oh, so I know what you're making this into a racial thing. You mean like, you mean like, fats, water and fats, domino and those people? Yeah, because they started it so. Okay, you got the credit, man. Thank you, sir. You feel better? You want to? You know, I'll light up a little bit of four shades of be good. The black sugar, you credit. How is it that there's some black people out there? Everything they turned into a racial thing. I didn't know Bill Hilly was black, did you? I don't think black guys had spit curls. Just spamming. What does that all about? What a horrible way to start. I would have rather heard wreck tire. I'd rather heard that guy was thinking of my head to be him. Do you? Sure. Go call. So anyway, there's another one of George's ass polls, which leads into our poll today. Which of these terms best describes George? I don't really know what inspired me to do that.

Anyway, here's the paragraph today from Hillary's book. Living history. Hillary Rodden Clinton. She is boring. And has much to do by nothing. Anyway, she says my father's father. He was senior was the sixth of 11 children. He started work at the Scranton Lace company. When he was still a boy and ended up a supervisor five decades later. He was a general soft-goek and man. Quite the opposite of his formidable wife. Hannah Jones, Rodden. Who insisted on using all three of her names. Hannah collected rent from the house. She owned and ruled her family and anyone else within her reach. My father worshiped her and often told me in my brother's the story of how she had saved his feet. And then of course, tear the story. You'll have to wait till I come back from vacation. So we're going to leave him hanging like an assault popper. What did Kathy Bates call them? The chapter plays. Yes. The soap popper. Believe you, hang in. And then you can do the story about you, Rodden's feet. Or whatever it is. You. What's smell even worse than Carlisves? 560 50 50 50 50 50 50 on a AT&T and Verizon.

Fidi was removed as Patrick Saint Margaret of Corona. Church on the West Side, make full 2002, and remains in inactive status for the Columbus Al Roman Catholic Diasis. Said Tom Burke.

Our straight eye for the clear guy team does more than redecorate. They give this game an a fashion makeover from the bottom up. Let's stop by getting you out of those clothes. Oh, easy.

Straight eye for the clear guy. Only on bravo because they're all to be at least one straight show on this room through network. You don't know the name of the guy, are you listening? No. Ew. Oh, yeah. This deal was the clear guy, which I know is unusual. And anyway, there's only one category at our vast pool there that doesn't have a whole yet and that's brilliant. I was thinking there might be a little bit of a little bit of a hat. And what would that be? Don't fall asleep next to George. Don't fall asleep while George is around. Someone you don't want to fall asleep. Or was it? Oh, the question was. Who's asked best fits on Carlos's face? That was the pull question. Well, in any rate, so I have an anonymous fascist as Bob Vermuth is into building. No wonder we're having problem with our streaming. Every time that asshole shows up, we each starts dittling around with our streaming. The stations internet quit dittling in the middle of this highly rated show. You asshole, where the number one show on a radio station. Where number one show on a radio station. Where number one show on a universe. And he's in there dittling with a goddamn internet connection. Every damn time. Man, he's going to have naked pictures of the beeslies up there doing it in that tree. And entry. He's got to. This man is so incompetent. Anyway, let me just ask you this since we're talking about stuff that I'm going to be nervous getting done. Best of since tomorrow's August, number one. The best in the old CD 2002, 2003 to want to be farting in most face. So, as long as you got his grave. Should be on. Next week. No, no, that's not what I'm asking. And also, I need to get an update on that because I had such a quivering call from month of the day. What a, what a pussy. A more how a David of key change. Right. There will be a slight delay involved in changing that. How are zaconate? Not a more than an additional week. Uh, she's, you know, my fused. You make my, you make my kishki's just tremble. You make my, you twist my kishki's. Oh, everybody, everybody is so afraid of their own goddamn shadow. It's pathetic. It's tragic. Well, we don't, we don't have to ask anybody's permission. That's, that's material that we play on a show. That's why I tried to tell him. I didn't raise a stink about it. But the thing that we're going to have to delay a week when we got this important fundraiser. The, the bit is, we'll change it and rate me. Yeah, so what's the behavior with that? He said that, didn't he? Obviously. You didn't create that. That wasn't one of those phones. No, you put together to try to make it look like a jackass. I'm bigger part. I did not slice or dice that. I will change it and rate me. Yes, it wasn't being the old with that. But oh, well, we got to remake the key change because, wow, but I've got to beat that up. And the reason we got to do it is because Muffins are afraid that it's going to come down on his ass. That's the reason we got to do it. And he's probably sitting there like, you know, puking his guts at me, you know, at the radio. Too bad. There comes the time when you have to butcher up a little bit. Okay. We can't be like, when you say somebody, we want you to be outrageous. And not a little bit outrageous. We're not like a teeny tiny bit either. You just go full steam. You know what I'm saying? Let's be ahead. No, no, no, no. He's the one who owns some miserable nasty rotten disgusting filthy smelly old man with the dead muskret on his head and a big fat coloss me back. Well, everything we do, we gotta worry about all. We gotta walk on egg shells because it might get more upset. That's really good. We don't want to get him upset and no more, because then he might escort another two three years on his contract. He may be working to raise about a hundred. So anyway, what's he answered in my question tomorrow? Are we going to have that stuff up there where they can start ordering? No. We're not? No. Let me see if I understand this again. The question was, since tomorrow's August 1st, which is what we've been Valley Hoon is the starting date for our fundraiser campaign for abandoned pet rescue, which I love so much. And you're telling me the answer is, no, no. No. No. Unacceptable. And what's the reason for the answer being, no, I don't know. What do you mean by that? Well, let's have a meeting about it. Who's having the meeting? Who's holding your meet? I guess me and Miguel and Eric and all of these, uh, Eric? Well, he's doing it. You get Eric involved in this and it'll be like July, a 4,087 before we get to ball going here. He's slower than freaking molasses man. Let's blame it on Eric. This has been, you know, this being a boy. This is George's new technique. This is the new tactic. Every time something screws up, every time there's a button. What? What? What? I agree with him on this one. Well, that's, say I was giving you the opportunity to slice Eric too. I didn't want to stem like I was doing it. We don't want to be piling on just like those two other guys who are like, you can't see them in that photo of a beat of boy pants down on the ship. But they're also two other guys who are like, start unsip their flies, speaking of piling on. Yeah. That's in the more exciting. I mean, what is all that barbecue sauce? I mean, you might as well do something. Right. Do you follow what I'm saying? Or was it mayonnaise? So anyway, the best of this keep watching our website. Well, I said, well, these days very, I beg your pardon. The middle of next week as in Wednesday. Wait. What? I'm sorry. Like I said, who's giving you this report? Let's talk to Miguel who actually knows some things. You're taking your phone from Chuck Eoria. Well, he flops. He wanted to just give us the answer. The question Mr. Perinoia. The key change should be in my hand on August 6. It'll be in your hand. But what about the key chain? I'm sure it'll be in your hand. And the key chains too. Yeah. But that's not the answer. That's not the question. No one is going to be up on the website. We're going to have the information. So people can start ordering this stuff up on our fancy schmancy website. Jesus, man. You think I was asking? Why? Why doesn't have to take the longest six? Do you have to have it in your hand? We'll be able to start bitching after two days. Oh, you are such a, why don't you go in your hand? We can put it up. Or listen to me. I want you to go in there. Close the door and stuff. So if it's the two you can do the limbo rock together. Okay. That's fair. I mean, you are such a pussy. If they order it, they know it's going to take a while to get their few days. Whatever. Yeah. Right. I'm glad you get all those phone calls. And I'll be delighted to put right on our website. You're home number. Your cell phone numbers. So they can call you to reckon speed up a little bit. Once they have to noon, they're bitching that they don't have it. See now you're siding with him. It's that stick factor again. It's one against three. Because that's not the reality. Because that's what happens. Yeah. They want it. The date. Okay. So let's make it a facial then. Okay. Let's put the onus on your bonus. Next Wednesday. I beg you pardon. You didn't get a bonus. No. We did. I'm sure. Those of us who work on the top rated neo-riders show. We made our bonus. Oh, nice going. Thank you. But you know, you're one of those people who unfortunately got dragged down by it. I want to mention no name. I'm so lucky. A certain show where they give you like. All the crap you could unwrap. Yeah. The crap, myster. So you're just another person in the buildings. Got good reason to hate him like poison. I'm not suggesting that you ought to because he just not your nature. And easy going guy. And you shouldn't be walking around hating people. It's not it's not it just doesn't speak well for it. Don't play hate. I mean, you already hate the reen so much. So you know, don't want to screw any for him. I don't hate anybody. Really? Not even Doreen? Not even you. How about that? Not even after she chased you into the men's end of the events from that day? Oh, that was been. And then, of course, what we got really Miguel of. So was the cheat. Had a bigger one than he's gone. Anyway, what's in these terms best? The scrims George. That's our poll question today. He's okay 34. And now you see, you're lucky you put that on there. You know what? Well, that's the right answer. You got all these. I didn't vote for that answer. I don't say you're okay. I know, but you've got. We know it's the right answer. Now, he's telling me how I should vote on a poll. What's the right answer? You've got the like brilliant entertaining. All these things, you know, and all these other choice. Well, there are a lot of people who like you. I mean, it goes in every votes yet. It's the only category with zero vote. And he's going to vote on a hundred and four. There he's sarcastic old man. It was that one. It was sarcastic. There are people. Oh, I've heard people calling you. How old goes in his business sucking your ass or are. Oh, my God. Your shop right in charge. You really know your. Yeah. Well, well, let's see. What's no bill about that. And I would say this day when it comes to certain obscure historical facts and information that you are brilliant. And you know, in certain part of your mind, what it used to be there, current events. Before the drugs war them away. He's okay, 35. And if you want to be 20, we'll get a big response on this second smell of boring 18, Pond had 15. And that's not negative. That's like they'd like to, they'd like to sit around and share a big fat one. We'll just matter five entertaining 12. Posit Queen 11. They just are convinced. Yeah. There's a good pull for a can't trust much. George or just in Tickerbell. Oh, I'll kick it. Here's a good one for you. I'm sure if there has ever been a mincing little fruity queen who got bottles through and in a month stage here last night. Bye bye bye. That was the message they were trying to give him is Tinkerbell. Bye bye. He floats like a butterfly. He looks me look like Hercules. He makes freaky curls of front look like Sanson. That's how, maybe David Sanson. Posit Queen 11. No, it all 11. Here for insomnia 8. Juvenile 6. I don't know what that's all about. Juvenile 6. Hard aspect 5. That's certainly the correct answer. I am Juvenile. You are? Absolutely. I would think Hard aspect is right on, but they don't, they have to know you personally to anal for sexually frustrated for another getting warm. Pervor 2, immature 1 and bring it out of 152, bring it in still a big one. I don't know. You know what? I think you're part, no. No, because I don't want to put all negative things on here. I mean, that's the ultimate compliment. If somebody said you were brilliant, but the positive ones you put on there are so extreme. Nobody would even vote for that. Well, we have to even get fed there. You put the godlike on there. No, I could. Well, you, you've entertained. You've got 12 votes for entertaining. What's wrong with that? Nothing. I'll take them. How, why, why would I ever want to do a poll where I give people a chance to rip? You can do this to me that one day when I'm on vacation. Oh, well, the me. I don't give a crap as long as I've ever checked. I don't care. I know. I'm old. I'm dodging. I'm on a way out. Man, I don't care what that logic of a crap. God. 10. And you should be objective the same way. You're getting old. You're dodging. Your hair is growing. You're on the way out. We all. We all. We all. Sooner or later. Let me say it again. Woodstock run by the Swiss. We had a great night here in Toronto last night at Downs View Parkfield Air Force Base. And what can I say half a million people? Almost half a million. Between four fifteen and a half a million. No, I mean, not one. There were a couple of arrests of unreliable drugs, whatever. But there was not even one fight, not a fist fight, not a pushing. Is it nothing? Nothing. Zero. Exactly. Unlike, of course, remember the stone's concert in California where the four, the hell's angels got in the, oh yeah, and four people died? I mean, every kind of time is a concert. Almost any place in the world are like people that get badly injured and mean, and wounded and killed and all of these things. Not a church. And you want to know why? Because it finally convinced me of the one word that separates Toronto from my soft offer example. I know what it is. Yeah, civilized. That's got to written down right here.

I like some kind of... Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It was a mod tickets because they have... Okay. And that's it. You got to tickets. I mean, what you do with it, right? But don't give any tickets to Fat Boy under any circumstances. So he's annoying. He's obnoxious. He's pathetic. He's a grotesque. He's overbearing. He will not go away. The answer is... No, no. Hi, I'm Pally. The answer is... Bye-bye. Five... On this story, I guess I better take another one or two of these calls. But I wanted to end this story that I hadn't heard anything about this story. Because I was... See, yesterday here, I hit the break the news to you. But all those coverage... That's all they ever was talking about was the name stone thing last year. That is it. But there was a whole lot of media at the event, including local, national, and international. And they're still... That's not the... Because it was a great event. But to story about the hoax in the case of the long-ressing Indiana girl in the... Yeah. Oh, how embarrassing. And then, of course, CNN gets in woodwood stance for certainly not news. You people at CNN... They try to save their ass here last night. They actually sent somebody here, which we appreciate that. Everybody in Toronto, the fact that he gave us worldwide coverage. A lot of great event was now well-weldable stage. Now wonderful. The city is at Cedric and so on. But this on the heels, they even admitted that since they were at the forefront of hype and all of that SARS-Crap, including a lot of cases were supposedly... It was exported, which we know was not. Remember those bogus cases in Texas? If it had somebody sneezed in Texas, oh, they got SARS. They were at the airport in Toronto for ten minutes. Crap, you know. And so they tried to redeem themselves. But to make a long story, sure, I didn't see this story about this so hoax, which we'll get into. And you'll explain it. Because you're brilliant. Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello. Fort Lauderdale. Long gone. Miami Beach, hello. Miami Beach, yes sir. And back to you. Are you going to answer them by any chance? Yes. Yeah, because they have the bare ass parade on some of their think on the canal. Yeah, this is pride weekend, Amsterdam, which I have no idea that it was when I made the reservations. Because you ordinarily have ordered those things like the plague, but at least there should be some people at this time. No, there's come to be a lot of people. I was just reading an industrial newspaper. Excellent. Can you do a poll on the week the day for you on and when Uncle George is on? Because I really like to see, I'm not tuning in anymore to this guy. He's a great guy, but he's trying to run a show with no subject and he just can't do it. He's much better when he finally has the subjects who people can call him for something. What do you mean by that? Can I run a poll? I don't understand what that means. He likes the whole building shows is what he's trying to say. No, no, what I'm trying to say is, it was a shot of me. You can't take a subject on the day if you're on because it's much more entertaining. You know, well, let me ask you this, what's the subject today here? What's our subject? Oh, you can run it without because you have that talent. Because I'm entertaining, which he is not right. I'm not here with only my point. And then you're a great guy, but I'm just, I said, I'm not right. How do you know he's a great guy? See, you do like it this claim or they're to try to like soften them all the time. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sure he's off the air. The great guy. He just cannot run away. He's going to a great guy. He's okay. I would say he's got to raise okay off the air. I'm great, but he's okay. I'm not a great friend, man. No, I'm a great friend. No, I'm a great friend. Okay. Talk about doing. What are you talking about, Bernie? Five, six, seven, five, six, five, six, five, six, five, six, six, six, the only AT&T. I tell you what they were going to humongous responses like I predicted. Never any shortage of votes when you bring up yours. Two or any, 85 votes. And how many? I'm curious about the brilliant. Nine, still stuck on nine, but it's a guarantee you ever thought you'd get nine. You said I'm not going to get you for that. You know, all defensive, all like that's another thing that they don't like. Don't be defensive, be more offensive. I don't think nobody's here. Don't like a wimp out like that little weasel sitting across me. They're in the chair, the weasel. Oh, he is. He's a weasel. He spends half this time on Moeshead. The other time passed out on the couch waiting for the lineup. You know? That's what keep in mind. That was just still picture. That was only like part of a long line. That was like a punga line. It's just a moment in time. Yeah. And if there's anything we love on this show, it's a punga line. There must have been a whole bunch of guys. I've heard a man standing on my waiting for a refill on the barbecue sauce. Waiting for their turn. Exactly. How was it being? Was it good for you there? I guess that's why he turned all of a sudden. Did the show last Thursday he was straight. I come on here today to a show and put a being. He's out of the closet. Must have had a great time at Pearl's birthday party. Gay. Post discovered in case of long-lossing in the Anna girl. You have to fill me up. I better do the break and then we'll get into this in the end. Because I don't understand why they would put this clown on TV. This poor bastard who's getting conned right. And why wouldn't they tell my head a time? Right. That's the big issue at this point. And it's not only the cops who have do closely with this, but what about CNN? Right. Didn't they know? Of course they must have. Everyone knew before the fact except him. Nobody bothered to tell him that it was a setup to catch his tears. I'm sorry that I missed it. Are they going to put it on again? Or if he are on the hour they had been for the past two days. Good. I'll be here because I never watched CNN and MSNBC anymore because it's nothing but propaganda and a lot of pompoms which he gave me dizzy. But I'll be sure and check it out today maybe.

Join us tonight as we delve into the life of Dubinai Thai and Silia Crew. Born in Oyster Bay, Long Island. Cecil Fragman was a gifted child in more ways than what little did he know what one it would be. The early days of his career were in Bobville, performing stand-up comedy in Bragg. So I tell him if you want flowers, don't bang a floor as a crown! Is it being gibbison? Who? One by Biffred's bottle's fill! Oh boy! Cecil signed up as a merchant marine and was sent to Cuba, where he retooled his knife of a back, and became the well-adowed Superman that was featured in the film Godfather too. Little did he know, Castro would rise to power, forcing him to change his act once again. Look how I'm around the tide right around that time, and there was a voice to be filmed. So I happened to be unlike Uncle Milton and I here, to try to slip on a dress and start singing. Cecil changed his name to Celia Cruz, and became enormously successful as a drag queen salsa singer. Rubin's dealings earned Celia his fortune, like they did song he had after a record label offered him 85 cents per record in royalties. Oh the saddote, Celia died. It's 45560. It's an 80-day game, I can't imagine it. WQAM, here's a facts from Feral fan across brings it says. I had a revelation last week regarding the free that works the reception desk of the studio. Now this obviously is one of our listeners who picked up some free stuff. Biggest on the rest of the facts that says he should be worshiping Feral and craving his package, and then over backward look his ass, why? Because with all the free tickets for else give it up, Rapunzel Chin has had a steady stream of guys to check out when they go get their tickets. Like this Feral fan across brings. So next time you see him wearing his office, let's sure that there's a freebie giveaway and that's his bait to tool for something to hit on. I hope that this facts are in Rapunzel Chin at a good time when you think he thinks they can beat him or go out there and like, referee. Kind of hop in. So let's talk about this. Folks discovered in case of long-missing in Indiana girl, what it first seemed to be an achingly beautiful story of a missing Indiana girl who found her way back home 17 years after she vanished, turned out yesterday to be nothing more than a cool hoax. Any ass state police officials had a woman calling family members of Shannon Cheryl and falsely claiming to be Shannon who was cis when she disappeared in 1986. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Donna Walker 35 of Tupica. Walker's were about to run known as of this morning. Did they see any update on the story? No. State police first sergeant Dave Burston said investigators have found no clear indication of a motive but he said, police believe the Walker contact the news media herself to get up interest in the case. We learned an age today where people like to receive attention he said. The drama began over the weekend when Dorothy Cheryl picked up the phone at her home in Thorntown, Indiana. A woman police officer, Billy Edna, ISIS, tried again. A woman police believe was Walker told Cheryl she was her missing daughter. The woman also spoke with Shannon's father, Mike Cheryl, who is divorced from Dorothy before Shannon disappeared, she even agreed to meet him in person. The phone calls once the family in a joyful frenzy. I'm just ecstatic over the whole thing. My Cheryl told Walker reporters, it's okay. Like George it's okay. Okay. Very right. But. State police investigators who kept the case open since Shannon disappeared were wary. The woman became skittish to soon as police try to arrange for DNA testing confirm identity. She would call police but refused to provide a phone number she could be reached. When pieces of the puzzle didn't fit accurately together as when we started looking harder, Burton said, during the investigation, Burton said police believe that the woman called them three times, posing as other people once as a man and tried to disguise her voice. They believe she obtained information about the case on the internet. Investigators didn't make their doubts publicly share them with the Cheryl's fury that the woman might never be identified and charged. The Cheryl family was unaware of the hoax until minutes before was announced yesterday at a police news conference, which was broadcast live by CNN. This is real hard. I was expecting this at all when they called me with the information for a news conference. I thought for sure they were going to bring Shannon in here. I thought this was going to be something. Marshall said before melting into sobs and bearing his face in his hands, Dorothy Cheryl sent by wordlessly, diving it or eyes with a tissue. You ready for that? Right. And like it goes on to say, the hoax part of it is not so I'm common as we wish they were. But what's abhorin about this is that the police and CNN and everyone knew, except this family, that this press conference was going to be all about nothing. How could they, how could they do that to help the police do that? How could CNN do that to him if they knew? Well, we know that they knew, yeah, we know CNN and all the media people are heartless bastards. But what about that? That sounds like a tremendous lawsuit to make her, because he's never going to get satisfaction with luck as like he said before the show this morning. I mean, this is like a misdemeanor, what's he like a prank call as well. She gave that. But the fact that CNN put this guy on there for a press conference, and then he finds out when he announced that this was a hoax on the air, so they didn't see that's what they love. That's what the news media wants. That's what you grave robbers want is to put people on the air crying and sobbing and catch them in their weakest, most emotional personal private moments. So I'm saying, I'm saying that when we catch what's your name? What is your name again? This broad dog or longer? Donna Walker? That we line her up and we let everybody have one shot with a baseball bat. That sounds good. All right. And CNN, we just don't ever watch it again. Plus something like that. I just give people a CNN make me surprised that a man you're a joke. You're a, you're a farce, you're a hoax and that thing of sure. I said to the guy up here last night, you talk about trying to cover your ass. They made a big deal about that bogus story and Texas a couple. We see after we finally got over the second star at Saras wave here and finally starting to make her come back. Oh, and Texas, there's these military that was at the airport in Toronto for 45 minutes. But above all, they got a cold and they got a bleeding oozing hemorrhide. Now, when they finally did the retrace in the next day, it wasn't the lead story. It was like, it's like when they do a correction in newspaper. Right. But like if the Harold from our puts on a front page, George Rodriguez accused of raping 15 women. And then, you know, the W.A. George George, and then if they put on the page two, you know, where they have like the, um, the subscription information and the thing that nobody reads, tiny little micro type. Tiny old correction. It was not. It was George Rodriguez from a sweet water was not George Rodriguez from the top because it's time to make in George Rodriguez in South Florida. They heard the regrets sincerely out of yoddy, in other words, don't sue our ass. Once you're crap, people at CNN, you should only croak, okay? The NMSNBC only nobody watches them. What a sad excuse for freaking news. 5670560 pound five 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. Here's plantation, hello. Gone? Yes, sir. Hey. What is your article? What happened to plantation? Okay. It's killer. Yes, it is. Mr. Rodgers, I'll put you to speak to you again. Yes, it is. You please afford me 15 seconds to make my point. What is that mean? I am a listener since 1987. Okay. Data. IOD QAM. All right. Yes. My point. What is your high slash wee tune in to 560 AM from 10 to 2? Thank God. Want to hear, by the way. Yes. Thank God for 10 to 2. I know. Absolutely. 9 to 1 is like, you know, close. What was it, correct? We want to listen to and hear the voice of new Rogers. You know, this respect to George. Yes. Because he is a great guy. And when I and Lee want to hear your voice. Yes. Why not the tapes? No, Henry has no substitute. When he's on vacation or whatever, they play tapes to fill in. But when he's not there, why doesn't cure? Are you sure? Because we have to add a lot of to do it. I don't want to re-hand. I don't want to. Listen to me. You are the best. That's what we want to see. Sir. We're only saying something to you. I don't care if it was a tape from yesterday. Sir, we're just. I don't want to. I will for you every month. Okay. Hold the sucking for just one second. Harvey? I say give me one second. Yes. The fact of the matter is this that I don't believe in tapes because everything we talk about and it is just like the story we just had on now. But the the the hopes on the fight and the growing the end. That's what we talk about whatever is going on now in town in the world. I'm talking about the big concert here last night in Toronto. Six months from now, a year from now, any of the things that I'm talking about today would be meaningless. It's like talking about alien and the pope visiting Miami. All these things and when it's to play the tapes, it's a bunch of outdated crap. Nobody wants to hear that. I response to that is you're absolutely 100% right. Right. That's what the fact that we love hearing the voice and the Rogers. You know, it was yesterday's tape two days from now. We do want to hear your voice. Well, how about how about if I just did like a generic tape where I read like the Toronto telephone directory. And it would not be outdated until I come up with a new phone book next year, which gives me a one year and at least you hear the sound of my voice. Okay. Survey says clean and outright. Do you understand my point that we love to hear your voice? That you're obsessed with my voice and you probably do a so-and the solution stays while I'm on the area. We're addicted to your voice. Yeah, see there's the dick part. Okay. Okay. This is the donut guy. Yeah. The donut guy. Yes, I do. Okay. And also listen to me. And play them clean up your act by the way. James, Harvey? I said, I'm glad you cleaned up your act. I have. I have the names of your agent, Jeff Beak. I want to say I love both of them. And I have the list in the two uses, 1987. We need tapes on those days. Not the district's back George George has a great time. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. See it, Winchels. I see it, Winchels. That. Ha ha ha ha. Ah. See that. There was a great cover. You know, the, the, the, the, the name of the same before. They just want to hear the sound of my voice. They're obsessed with the sound of my voice. They feel like they're okay. Like life is okay. And that they can get up for another day as long as I'm on the ear. I show up. Now, what are these people going to do when I return about five minutes? I mean, about the three and a half. How come it keeps it continues being three and a half years? It seems like I've been saying that for a long time for a lot of years. Not third and man. Every and a half years sounds like a lifetime away to me, especially another. I'm a dotting old fool. How how am I going to do this in three and a half years? I was saying to somebody yesterday, I'm thinking very strongly that this Tuesday and Thursday thing. I could get used to this in a heartbeat. Of course, there have to be a lot of occasions like the one I'm starting out. Huh? No, and I think Bina Boy is very important for you. And it's good that you got to summer schedule on there. But now that I'm going on vacation today, and we'll be back until Tuesday, August 12th. You probably want to put that on there for people like him who desperately need it. It's not a shot at George. It's just that George is not being taken right now. George is not being. George is not being. He's not those awful awful tapes. I mean, it happened to other really good people back at IOD. Remember when they tried to go? Who was that? A defo, Randy, Rick and Sides. No, I thought you said it happened to good people. Oh, I'm sorry. I was Sides. Yeah. And they were just shredded by the audience. They will accept what? When did Randy fill out on my show? Did you say it was the end? It was the end. It was the end. And it only lasted two days. Why is that? Outpouring according to Gary was just way too negative and they replaced it with tapes. Because they couldn't stay. They were ringing the phone off the hook. You mean, I was like, when they tried to re-affoon and they put the long because they came to this side. I mean, I'm not in Randy there. Am I? Yeah. But stay had her filling in for you for a couple days. I still have great respect for her gigantic pair though. I really do. Show not. She has big balls. Yes, she does. She loved a few people. All ears are working this business who had the balls to tell men is with the ghost to get right up their ass. And that wins a lot of points with me. Because most people in this business are a bunch of wimpy, nervous little nellies. I don't want to mention stuff because he's already got problems. They're when I keep changing things. Nervous little wimpy people who like kind of cow or an a corner. Oh, it's a fight. Greg, it's a fight. Yeah, I grab. Very sad. That's not a good guy. I don't know if he's a good guy. But the, the posture that he brings to the table. He's so wimpy and so in effectual and so lame and so weak and so useless and so. Swishy. 156. It's at 5. 60 W Q.

See how better I tell people because I told I'm going back to Amsterdam. A vacation oven's railing and screaming. The only how we'd never go back there. And it was very disappointed. And it was. The last two trips I've made there been extremely disappointing and there weren't a lot of tourists and it was like Nothing but a bunch of Dutch people which most of us don't want to be around and that kind of like that But in August now see in southern Europe like in Italy and in Greece and a lot of the country Spain parts of France that's August is the month there where it goes on vacation Not so much in northern Europe in fact a lot of those people from southern Europe may wind up in Amsterdam People are like taking a vacation time looking for a hedonistic place where they can go and screw around have a good time It's gonna be really interesting what's going on in those coffee shops because I don't know Remember that's start we head off there now. What's up in a band the weed and hash and the any about because of the anti smoking Fanag is not because of the drug element Gonna be everything to see if there's still smoke any We're gonna rope we'll be eagerly awaiting your report not that you normally go into one of those places But you might want to just stick your head in there and see what's going on. I have never been in a Coffee shop in Amsterdam in my life. Well, do it's a favor. Well I'll stand outside enough. I'll sniff In fact, there a lot of places in Amsterdam you go outside But you don't want to sniff too hard because there's so much dog crap on the street if you sniff too hard to like You just destroy your nasal passages. It's bad for you So I forget I'll give it one more chance and a great thing about Europe unlike the US which is so damn big, you know And Canada to Canada's gigantic. It's you're gravity Europe is tiny it's small And Amsterdam's a good and easy place to fly directly to from here or from Miami and as a result of that if you like get there And it turns out there's nothing but scumbags and a bunch of nasty clone leather queens and stuff like that Then you get on a planery get on training or someplace else Hit my drift. I caught it. There you go. So that's why I'm going back but not that I need to explain to anybody But probably there are some scratching their heads one region. We're just carrying on hysterically about how Amsterdam sucks and don't go there I'll give you a report when I come back. I'll you know because there's there's no point at spending your vacation time and money on a place that's gonna suck So take it for me if there's too much suck and go and I'll let you know and probably there will be on pride weekend We must suck and go in on being a boy if I'd maybe be no boy I'd like to go there Don't you think I don't think oh I can I won't be glad to I volunteer to take some pictures or you with a Screen okay I can't say the one on there But you got the camera for it and some of those other places Here's a call from Where is the plantation hello?

It says I just got back from a trip overseas but a couple of days in Amsterdam I could have saved a lot of money by taking I-95 stock through overtime In fact downtown Amsterdam is Miami look like the cleanest friendly city in the world the word that comes to mind Describe Amsterdam is Ronti along with all of its synonyms. Belgium was outstanding See I have to engage for myself because it sounds to me like Ed who sent this fact. Maybe that was his first time there Okay, I don't I don't know But I mean some some people would have gone here like five years ago Instead obviously really wrong you place you know bohini and whatever I don't know what you describe it But if there's a lot of people there it'll be fine. You follow him saying no If there are a lot of tourists there and if the city is really hopping and buzzing it'll be great It's only when all the locals are there and the roster drug crowd out there in the streets and there's not much else going that they stand there so conspicuous Because I'm used to that But when there the only thing there it's kind of disturbing and you get on a train and go to Colony immediately I'm gonna tell you right now and this is the honest to go to this truth if anybody in the world out there wants to go to what you got some bucks You got some vacation time. I'm begging you in fact. They just had a big story on him last week because they had a big Hail storm so I again a calcesterman colon very bizarre in our like in the middle of July And they showed it look like it had snowed about a foot and it was all hail All I went went all the heel and colonial but anyway seriously I'm not exaggerating is such a fabulous city and There's so much to see and the even just in the train station Is spectacular what is that tell you Have you pardon?

There It's not no why Because I'm not you So what does that mean or see what you don't understand? Is that I keep telling the server here because you're out in the summer and all of it case the best especially the summer time But people are listening now. It's not my audience Some of it is but there's a big part of the audience you have that hate me like poison.

I've got to IQ larger than than some unlike you I'm not going to sit here and hit political opinions to try to please you bye bye Rather than call me and give me a son that's used to be speck me. Okay. I've been a liberal Democrat and even though the Democratic Party sucks I tell you that all my life and then for me to start closing up to some right wing much of fascist lunatics some corporate Looking assholes and they gonna happen. Okay, so I don't act like I've done some wild turn to the left Right on this right there because I haven't done it I'm consistent consistently right okay not to the right politically, but correct Right, but that's saying he's called that same crap people on he's been listening he'll never turn it I say same garbage man Just call sit there waits for 40 minutes to give me the any nose a knock-on-o-sen was bull crap See how paly see how just do a little boost up man just give me the practice there you know Check ass Here's my any hello Yes, sir What is to your grandma Play most taught this Comment on the George thing I mean I mean I just because I admit those couple of times go ahead my dark conflict is for them So I do cool one thing about George is he doesn't buy this time he says his own his mind right and He never suck up because if he did sometimes he expresses this just pleasure about Gay So-where I'm for instance, right and at the risk of Papa's on fat with you now he doesn't look like any fight because he knows I hate those shows too. It's a So right even do that okay You know Is that okay Okay, I do What he's trying to say is your anti-symmetric what he was trying to say? Yeah, that's what he was trying to say he was trying he was observant he realizes that you have this Jew thing Even got rid of his Jewish accountant Which by the way that was a good thing my Irish account may be an opera couldn't refuse good excellent. I like the Irish No, it's to be a counts out of me like sexual all I want to be anywhere near them.

It was okay, but Watching on TV naturally being the old purve that I am I'm watching those young people in a crowd and of course It was a hot afternoon evening and the guys most of them had their shirts off and like I told you a couple of the girls had their shirts off Which was pretty exciting for some and it was it was unbelievable You see because generally speaking this is a city that's like most real cities that has loads and loads of young people living in breeding beautiful people You can walk out like downtown you go out on a young street and like go to a restaurant to sit there at the window and look out and your tongue is down here Down here knees down here ankles because there are so many beautiful people to pick and choose and squeeze from See what I'm saying as opposed to South Florida with the ever-jages about 90 In addition to which you've had a whole bunch of banana boat people look like the spaceship just landed. Yeah, I mean I don't mind banana boat people if they look human But for some reason South Florida seems to have attracted a lot of banana boat people are looked like you know My favorite Martian or something you know I'm talking about sure You see it in your car you're out there trying to drive on a highway it's frustrating enough and you look to your left And you've served here right to try to stay alive and and you're looking at those assholes that are out there and you're one of you so Who are these people I can't tell you how many tens I've done it you're looking and hopefully maybe once in a while You see somebody who looks feel fairly attractive might be interesting, you know Maybe a little cruise right out there on the highway or real one And the beautiful I beg you, pardon and chances are it'll be an asshole and it'll be like beiner boy Sitting there, but his guy damn license plates stuck up his ass Maybe that's what the cop was upset about the other day maybe the thing is you know and of course Being a boy is trying to put anything there and try to heal it up real fast In fact, I got a great name for beiner boy Since he came out today how about the Vaseline queen oh No Vaseline queen oh, I think we got our thumb on a baby.

There's no paper trail It's just it's just like in in the e-thrick it's just a number that comes out of a machine somewhere and and you and and once it's done Once you've touched the button and left How do you know what what it shows up? I have right you don't you know what huh? You don't It's crap, okay I say paper ball of a crayons for everybody. That's what to do it Just just a bunch of places to check and if you're really too stupid just make an X anything How come I used to be the thing they knew how to do an election? What once upon a time? Well, they thought they knew how to do it before the gray robbers decided that there were better ways to fix it right Fine by the way this next year we got some bad news for the right wingers there will be a few people black people Love the vote and they stayed afloatly will allow a few black folks to vote this time That'll be it which is a start Here's a call from Miami. Hello Yes, sir sounds like you Look at that. I transferred you to the handset from the hands free no problem this time. That was outstanding. Yeah Listen first off. Let me press this what I'm gonna say with George et cetera With in a perfect world. I could listen to Joe Rose in the morning right you and he afternoon the mad dog Tilt six and then for all of the evening so I have the choice of turning him on or off right too much baseball But anyway George I'm a 40 year old heterosexual male but Dude you get stale after like 10 minutes it's a thing over it. Oh I mean nothing against George. I'll listen to him on an off-foot right You know well what is it that he talks about it is that there's internet connection That he's having so many problems with the reason that the swing club or the anti-emal fixation Who's it though? You know I mean the the sex and all that is great You're quick First of all you're getting you're talking about talk about something different every day every segment of every day You're gonna Backed in a corner I do like do I didn't mean to but anyway I just want to just I'm one buddy who does like yeah, but that's cuz he you know He's been said to the smoke cloud all day and he loves the George talks about that Okay, okay Thanks pal. Okay, well that guy didn't like you too much, but no they can't all of you and In addition to which let me ask you this what's more interesting to hear people calling in who like you or people calling in a one-review An answer okay, no, okay, so I think as you I mean I'll make something up for a change. I may have pulled this out of my very anacet to clean ass See one thing about maybe cute. I don't I don't know anybody behind okay I just you know if I'm gonna be in a back-alien I'll start up against the wall just to make sure there's nobody behind me And I don't get stowed off my ass and fall asleep especially Especially wearing them a position where somebody can sit on my face to him sing Like I was all hidden I mean how many and we don't even know I mean, you know of course he's fantasizing Maybe there were a few women in the crowd, but no, I don't think so It was like a Daisy chain of guys. I would say All it's said on his face during that Grootette There was no there. I went around but they were in a crowd, but they weren't crowded. They weren't crowded to see the cue boy Okay, so it'll call up George right I know George route that all those guys up and gave a sleep in the middle of a room in the center Right the room in the couch in the middle pictures on our website by the way everybody needs to seem I will say this I want to go on record to sing and spread the fact that he is two marlins and sense of all of it is baseball Season now, but for all this guy in this next trend then you're gonna start seeing it. You again He's gonna have a number that's gonna be huge You'll see I'll see the only problem being that in the morning it'll be diluted in half in other words If he got a 10 and it'll be a six Which will still be where from a three and many on his last book, but you won't be able to divide it because in the monthly trends We can't go out by our we can't we can't do this stuff as when a full book comes out Those are your ratings experts in the audience But you'll see can I have a big number? Of course that'll help you during the summer It'll help us right and I still say that with all of our fingers George as in the past two summers when he's filled in He'll still have and midday will stop the highest number on the station as pipedition Is there any doubt about it? No, no, but you say VQ boy Absolutely no doubt You don't have to be defensive or depressed about the name Everybody if you're gonna have a nickname at least let's put a little bit of honest into what being a boy You're not Mexican. I mean being your age just it The only reason I did that is because it replaced ugly Chuck which George came up with I Which I thought was really grotesque and as usual Much more cost it than I am George, you know, he'd like to make me out to be the bad guy But George is the heart ass spit like I said You got a point everything like tell somebody In between it's just an alternative to because you do sound like being a boy But it was an alternative to ugly Chuck which I thought was even though you are extraordinarily ugly and take it for me because I know ugly I'm an expert. Well, we're gonna sleep on a couch with but with being a boy is a vassaline queen who they is sprouted out of the closet is there Come into the sunshine which for a Julio for a cubano no less a monicon a book at home I think I would have been appropriate there today But it wanted to come out and like write it right out in public on a highly weighted show to say I'm a fag I'm a vassaline queen. He's a very proud of that But I'm very cultural. We he you everybody keep saying that he was asleep on the couch There's a time I never said that I wasn't there. He was he appeared to be asleep on a couch past if you examine the question Outro yeah, yeah, oh, I was drunk, but actually I'll take that to go to sleep and you remember nothing We posed him like an action figure and he didn't wake up So so that I think there's almost saying it all long They're gonna be not 30 guys are gonna like 75 guys. They're taking their turns, huh? Maybe that's why there was that economy that gigantic family size jar at home So we'd like as a as a as a as a man if they all Vaseline queen I Oh my favorite Republican this is mad rod and it's time for the skills they are blowing it's time once again for the Neil Rogers one to two hours Oh Oh My friend Think about this and All things Oh And Green so I live in all my face And I went to work I look like a jerk and I was fired in this frame It's They got nuts, and the red thing comes Rolled on the soft pinks It comes pink to our door All the soft pinks Tarn the pink to our door I saw him on the side of the top Oh, and the hook has all my arms I saw him in a bowl of sick-yating The shabby's got a little bit of a shabby It's a soft pink to our door All the soft pinks Tarn the pink to our door All the soft pinks All the stiff-pulls I saw him on the top of the top Oh, and the hook has all my arms All my friends, they got nuts Down and a bit of a...

It's boss news with a powerful prime timeline of so powerful that we're going to keep repeating the word Powerful is much as possible. First it's the O'Reilly factor. Oh no, no. I'm not letting you get away with that. It's more debatable than eight on Fox News. Kennedy and Goam discuss the issues of the day at the top of their lungs. The Hillary Clinton issue of crazed twisted liberal or just a vicious can I be. The news presents the edge with polo's arm. We don't know why she has a show but she's your load skill. Tonight on the edge will examine why George W. Bush is the greatest president in the history of the universe and will hear from both sides conservative Republicans and liberal Republicans. Fox News, that's how it is always fair, accurate and balanced towards our point of view. On Fox News, watch news. We distort. You decide. I was on with the while I went down to the grocery store.

I'm too good at lunch and meat to write back to my friends. What's up with Jeff? I once wrote the Oscar Maya and he called me right back. He's because I got a good look at the ingredients of the label. Now I know why I was on sale and store tried to unload him. Because it's made out of snouts, lifts and picks grow them. And watch with all that nasty jelly anyway. I watched my hands 15 times. This is still ain't going away. The child don't care. If y'all don't care, I got 12 more cans up in the fridge.
