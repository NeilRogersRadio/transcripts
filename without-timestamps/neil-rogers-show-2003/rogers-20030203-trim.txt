in sparyl he doesn't be between the period gives all the scores whatever up there on a big good diamond scoreboard with a squeaky voice how about kelly is he also not allowed since he's an employee of this radio station does the morning show with more every morning is he not allowed to express as a opinion about the trade or anything else or do we all have to go step in line like Michael Russo fat little poor hacker Michael Russo and write about all mad colon is great and this is really good you're an idiot Mike you can at least your consistent you have got any idea what you're writing about sandus ozolins was wasn't playing good anymore but of course so it was my keen in that play them into the ground overplayed him was his fault well so it playing out on him and by the way sandus ozolins just closed on a house a few days ago down here you don't think the organization knew that he had just closed on a house and didn't go to him and say uh don't buy a house not so fast we're considering a worth thinking maybe yeah did they do that no and you could see by the staying ovation he got when he was introduced and how embarrassed he was just to be there by the way that a force him into showing up that you know you fool the fans here at one time too many okay Alan Cohen and and this thing right here it's like saying well you know you hated Wayne high single but he has no more so now we got a fresh new star we're going to go out there we're going to spend money we're going to did they do it did they spend the pop l money no i mean it's tragic how many times do you think you can keep slapping people in the face and having them come back and spend that kind of money for an inferior product and everybody on the cbc telecast of the all-star game yesterday basically virtually everyone said this trade sends the message that the team is given up for the season they've written off any chance for the playoff they've given up well that's not a message the public wants to get and this guy goes on the air post or what it hell he is i guess he's the he's the success of the omelet i guess yeah who's it was going to be next after they get rid of him cinnamon roll pop tart pop tart that's not that keeps that in mind Paul I know you're listening right now that's right there still on the earth are they are they probably do six to ten like all other morning shows on real radio stations they probably do six to ten i should point out to you by the way that email it started all that crap this morning wasn't about me wasn't about to show wasn't even about that particular bit and yet somehow that conversation got carried along and he'll Roger says this and he'll order said because that's basically what we got now is an orchestration of all the dentists and all the anti-neils who pretend not to have a sense of humor not to understand then as you virulent anti-semite by the way who's very upset that oh it's only when the Jews get picked on it you people get upset but anybody else didn't we have the story about the rabbi up there who in the bokeh rubber was was millesting the kids who went to jail then we had that story sure yeah and about the the other rabbi or canter whatever was that was soliciting sex from that the kid on the internet didn't we have that story yeah so you see when you just get a lot more rabbi in the canter is another you wish you a man of the cloth to start molesting children maybe then they'll get as much press as much airtime as the Catholic church dentist made it out of pacify so far we don't see that happening in fact we got a new one today speaking the Catholic church which former resident of Boy's townfile sex abuse lawsuit on the Hannah Brassgobl get to that but it just reached the point I mean here again here's a guy that expresses his point of view you're fired you can't say those things you're on the payroll of the organization I'll tell you one thing Wayne has been as bad as he is was never any worse than what I'm seeing there now the faces change in that organization but the thin skin uptight we can't take any criticism we want to manipulate everything you say that mentality is just as strong now as it ever has been ever has been how many years in a road you think you can keep going along and sell us the youngster that which there are some good ones and there are some stiffs the youngsters in the organization you know that that bull crap and I'll make the playoffs and have the people keep coming back spend them that kind of money so this weekend including yesterday's all-star

that is good and decent look as ridiculous as possible we hope we reach that goal or leave me tonight on he and entertainment television Michael I heard to use to use little toy and teetle for spare parts but now assistant group from Europe's cloning babies you'll be able to clone your own stuff yeah I can't wait that is wonderful it is wonderful this is unbelievable so what do you want to clone

broward stations please let me know if anything is going on with rick and suds I miss listening them CT and homestead answer rick and suds are still in the area hoping to find a new gig the orangers keeps their names alive but they're only a few stations in which they would fit and clear channel which let them go on's most of them go to answer Tom that's right see that's basically what it's boiled down to an honest radio business and uh this market is a classic example of that you work for people who lie to you and they may call kinds of representations and they jerk you around and if you don't like it well who you're going to go to work for huh because clear channel owns all the other radio stations so take it or lump it so not only have they done the list is a tremendous disservice not only have they eliminated an enormous number of jobs because like that thing we from the hearings of the FCC on Friday talked about they pump the same syndicated crap and it just about every market around a country but also the fact is that the people who are left in the business their choices are just about gone to you don't like it here see you good luck go work for David Ross that's what it boils down to so they destroyed this business every possible aspect of it for the listener for the people the working for the people who aspire to be in it nice going cheap channel okay and as far as Rick and Suds are concerned good luck to them good luck to his sons that would not see there you go again smurking a little bit why do you do that why do you always do that they can't hear you smurking which is why always call you on it on the year so they know you're smurking at Rick's mixed mixed portion he's a mick there you go again on your Irishman out there protest protest how much is all lined up outside all the way to godday my is very wrote well it's not that far guys oh and speaking of the media going crazy Friday CNN did you see that what they were doing we had the little chase here luckily everything turned out okay with a mail truck and the lady attracted her by the way had big balls nice gone sweet archie did it right she had also very well thank goodness that's why she's probably still alive but right right down to road here practically in fact a past right in front of the station that they want up on the 183 and 27th of them but not that far from where we're sitting right now this all unfolded through the afternoon and it it was you know a very bizarre event whether with a reasonably happy ending always love it when they get the robot out you know they had the robots in their pointing at it I'm not looking at you know that kind of thing and I go home and I turn on CNN horror in Miami! all right did you see that? no horror in Miami now I got to be honest with you it was an unpleasant story that was unsettling and especially put a truck mail lady but it wasn't horrible okay it wasn't like you know and especially at a time like this when everybody's really concerned about the potence of another terrorist attack something really horrible but the media don't ever confuse them because they got to have bigger and bigger headlines they got to have big red uh shmared all over your TV screen that's the way they do it just like they they're still going on now it's still going on now about the Columbia it's almost 10 o'clock on Monday morning it's over two full days after the explosion we have seen every possible angle we've heard every possible explanation we've heard all the talking heads every theory I got articles if you go to our website and ask the dismissed advisor who warned about safety experts warned of budget cuts and safety concerns so there are a lot of people are offering their opinions but in the meantime they don't even have all the pieces yet and then how much more do we have to hear about the pieces of the bodies they fill in the yards of the people and Texas you think we need to hear a little bit more maybe we could see some of the pictures on television uh of a leg here in a arm there what I mean what is wrong with you people you're crazy people you're nuts and we take the heat here on a show for a few comedy bits because we have people out there pretend to have no sense of humor who want to be up tight who want to go and the thing with Bruce Fremming by the way I hate to break the news to you Bruce Fremming is an empire who works for major league baseball he represents major league baseball we are paid on this radio station for example to give our opinions whether they're serious comical us are casted costig whatever they are and I'm gonna tell you another thing even though it's very politically uncorrect to say these days in America and that is not said it before you show me anybody who doesn't have any prejudice and I'll show you somebody doesn't exist there's no such thing how many times have we taken at pull and we have some of you liars out there oh I don't have a prejudice born in my body right right sure you don't who the hell are you kidding and this thing with toast you whether we know it's gonna do it there near a hockey fan or pants event it's not the point the point this isn't just another example of how you cannot speak your mind in this country today without jeopardizing your job because everybody wants to tell you what to say and when you can say it where you can say and I say the Panther organization screw you guys that's what I say to you okay I'll be there Wednesday to see the Maple Leafs play and that is that's the only time that I'll be coming to those games and I got all my tickets for free so all your free loaders oh gee can we ever take it now no that's it I've had it screw an over jerk in a public around try to make something into something that it's not using your little puppets in the media they're like that fat pudgy Michael Russo to write a puff piece all that bull crap I'm surprised we didn't have a thing in a paper this morning about Ray Whitney falling in a Ranger game a couple years ago before we got and by the way nice go on Ray he ripped the organization big time nice go on baby he didn't keep his mouth shut that's the way they do what a player's in this organization they they treat him like crap they blow him out of town again nothing and exchange and then they badmout them oh he was bad into room he was divisive he was selfish pop out was this ray was they right and the meantime here comes another dreary season with a bunch of boring games and you know it's in that ain't gonna make the playoffs and how come you folks aren't coming out to give us your hard earned money I mean we got tickets like ten bucks a piece dollar a hour how about for free you want to come out show us the drivers license when you show up no anyway be that isn't me and here's our night of ten hour I don't see a call on a board there do you oh we had one and did you get that drop of Howard and Goldie say and blah blah blah same one dick oh did he playing again 147 votes under Paul and by the way moll let me say it again Danny he'd leave our four goals in the game and the fifth one which doesn't count as a goal but nevertheless in the shootout I just thought I mentioned that he's trying to match the Sun Sentinel and the Harold I guess no interest whatsoever until the all star festivities and because it was here in town oh gee this was a great of about what do you know about it you know anything about it mom no how were you personally impacted by the Columbia shuttle disaster I asked this morning on our pool it was a tragedy but she had happened 101 how do you like that so you know the reason I took this poll because I was thinking of myself is it only me is it only me 101 out of 147 almost 69 percent I didn't make that number up almost 69 percent said it was a tragedy but she meant happens what else are you gonna say I'm not like it all Maroce about it it's a sad thing it's unfortunate it's you know but that's it how does that help anybody anyway getting all Maroce and it helps the media it's good for ratings makes more people to an end not if we don't somewhat somewhat the impacted 27 very greatly 15 and not at all four so only 15 less than 10 percent out of 153 people in this audience said it were very greatly impacted by the tragedy so at least I feel a little bit more human now that's not just me that I'm not some hard-hearted son of a bitch I'm just a regular old son of a bitch is what I am as opposed to some mean spirited hard-hearted prick like they say follow what I'm saying George prick here's Boko hello okay sir yeah you know about the special thing I felt that for a little while I was too bad but it's like you know the airline are goes down they lose like you know 300 people right you know it's worth it's in the paper for a day or so and that's the end of that and you know I was watching them when the the post-alaiting got taken over by the uh and then you know ended peacefully I was that was pretty good and but I was watching the news people say wow we're all grateful that that ended without a shoot out of it and that's below and it would have loved that the media would have been and they would have been having to change their underwear every five minutes if that would have been a shoot out. One thing before I got I did you get a chance to look at the sun's time I guess that I was reading the article about there's gonna be used in rap lyrics to teach in teaching English and history and some of the schools now. Oh yeah the big of a big article right in the second the front page is open it up uh like the third page in the front page. Well this be careful what you say about in public mister. Oh no it's ridiculous it's gonna say no I'm you know that I feel bad the leadership and that black community is gonna help them go you can't complain about the leadership because there isn't any that's the problem and now the dab of just gonna test market and colleges and see if it goes over and then it's totally silly shocking and they're in there he just went now you I don't think he uh ready oh yeah it sounded like a normal one it did sounded like abnormal to me whatever you say sir I have no idea what you'd be saying nine fifty six and five sixty wqm I'll tell you the beast I don't care what anybody says the beast is a uh midget now compared to what he used to be I bet you when he comes in this Friday he's down like around two thirty-ish.

off and again we're going to have real problems by talking about this on power ninety six right down all you know down here yeah over ask you one thing oh yeah what's that crap they plan on a hall on power ninety six yesterday they had a recording every half hour so saying no one was working out of respect for the astronauts they couldn't have fun after such a tragedy almost drove off the roads as this facts are chronic facts I mean can I ask you one of the things what we all doing here today then I'm bereaved we acted as shuttle disaster it's it's that but what some obviously it's still a tragedy how could no one have been working oh maybe the janitor was like plantapes I don't know we don't have an automated system over there who's we what what what do you mean we we the state as in

right there's a say in here a computer plan stuff it says they had a recording on that doesn't mean that nobody was working the recording was saying that now you're calling them liars not only are you making fun of the fact that we're trying to show a little bit of respect but now you're calling them liars and kid courage's going to come in here and beat you up a little bit or a lot he likes to pick on little people maybe Carlos too and just for the holiday might beat the crap out of you well let's tell you about Anna squeak in her great ass so there you go I mean talk about it and understand that it wasn't like it wasn't like nine eleven it wasn't like a president died or something like that or like another terrorist attack it was an accident like the poll sash meant happen 72.3% of you saying that out of almost 200 votes already she meant happens it's sad I mean we were happy about we're unhappy it's unfortunate it's a terrible thing but terrible things happen all the time there's six seven billion people crawling around on a planet okay they're uh that thing on North Korea on sixty minutes last night I still can't get over that I still can't I wish you the scene it you haven't got any idea the hospitals have no beds and no running water what they use for IVs they use old dirty beer bottles with tubes stuck in whatever fluids they got in there I can't only want to imagine maybe some old mice to brow and it got tubes running out of there and going to the veins into people's arms that's a idea of IVs they showed people eating bugs insects they said there's almost no birds flying around because every time a bird comes anywhere near they capture it and cook it up and eat it birds eye yeah they showed a nighttime aerial satellite view of North and South Korea and South of the border because South Korea of course has become very cosmopolitan and it's all lit up in a lot of light and nor and it like pitch dark there wasn't a single light they have no heat no heat they showed this gigantic skyscraper that they built that's got so many structural flaws that it was never opened it's just standing there they showed these condo buildings that the the the handful of affluent people of there that they have apartments in they also have no heat and no running water North Korea and we're worried about Sodom compared to the people in Iraq the people in Iraq are like the people in Fisher Island compared to the people in North Korea and that maniac over there Kim Il-Jong he's got the guy damn bomb he's moving around now they showed all the people out there goose stepping those are the only people who get fed at a million million people who's got a military I've been looking his ass before six o'clock tonight I'll say that right now if we want to have you know find some people to be really worried about it's amazing to me how you know Stalin had all those nuclear weapons and the right long after his death the Soviet Union had as many nuclear weapons are more than we did and somehow we're all still here oh weapons of mass destruction possessed by manifestly irresponsible lunatics and somehow we managed to coexist now if we had gone to war against them yeah we wouldn't be sitting here talking right now now it's all about a problem's a 255 oats how were you personally impacted by the Columbia shuttle disaster it was a tragedy but she meant happens 150 73.1 percent some luck 35 very greatly 15 7.3 percent not at all five five and the media can't look at this getting a Palabias final Boyd here's a call from sunrise hello yes good morning Neil you sure when is the yes well we're really got to do is worry about the people within the country I think we got more problems here I was watching TBS last night and they had a story on Andrew Jackson and his wife Rachel and due to the fact that hard divorce was in final he actually had married in adulterous anyway the point being in the 1820 something election against Quincy Adams they went crazy and they used the fact that this is a Christian country this is only 50 years after the fact now today the front page of the son Sentinel if you take a look there's a cross with some of the bodies were found you know what is the Jewish guy of the Hindu guy you know and it's just the people within this country all these new evangelical idiots level one so we really got to watch out for you say that's it that's what that's out of the country amen that's a good day blinded by the right David Brock I go out to IBM I waited the book stood a B. Donnser our borders one of those books there is right now if I was you people and I would sit there I would lock myself and a room with a flashlight and a couple of bottles of soda or whatever and I'd read it from cover to cover and find out how to help we got to where we are right now not a pretty picture this from 3000 degree heat I mean like I ask you a question how many days is this gonna go on in the media another week and let me say again the only reason I want to watch in a hockey game me is to am glad I did because it was very entertaining because I don't care about the old stuff because there was nothing else on there was nothing else on and you know what saved me the rest of the book of Ryan can relate the game show channel there you go I want to say thank God it is good for the game show channel I'd rather watch any day the week 85 year old episodes of match game Hollywood Square is the old one or any of these then watch this non stop finger a squeeze in the hand-written wrenching how long can it go on what more is there for them to say are those astronauts still dead last time we checked yes is the shuttle back in one piece yet we don't think so it could happen and how many more people all all you know something this in the midst of all this other stuff I made this light out on the floor after I tell you this because obviously nobody else saw it luckily Saturday morning I go get my haircut the guy oh built synth on he gave me a good haircut he was very grateful for the tip of the way go get nice haircut I come back home it's now 10 past nine I turn on MSNBC and they're in the middle of well Houston's lost contact with a Columbia and it's the first time you're getting an inkling that's something is wrong okay now if it comes obvious that the worst has happened it's a good to be about nine thirty so now they're putting on phone calls this one at NASA this one in Houston this one from a so-and-so the local affiliate in Texas about the fourth call they put on the R&MSNBC you haven't heard about this though the guy calls in a dull voice and says and just paraphrasing because I don't remember I don't want to remember the exact word oh I spoke to a close to a personal contact in mine inside NASA and he was fearful that Howard Stern was on the ship and at that point I said to myself what's the use what this is one of those same assholes who used to call every kid all the time oh I present it my book too I would like to know what you think of the Howard Stern you know and on rare occasion it was funny okay in a sick way which is you know Howard's audience in a sick way but here we just had seven people die we had this horrible miss app grotesque thing that just happened and here yah yah yah see what I'm saying this is this is the crowd out there I'm telling you they just make me want to vomit make me want a puke and I'm not playing Howard for that I mean that's just that's just a part of his crowd just like and you know nothing that we don't have the same because we do but isn't that just it's just let me sit in there like limp I didn't know I always do that you'll never stop pretty funny stuff huh pretty funny you'd you'd like to be able to trace that call and take that individual all we're gonna say person but that would be a stretch take that piece of crap and like strap him into which here and put him on network TV on all the networks and PBS at the same time and are all the cable affiliates at the same time and just watch everybody just beat him to death with a stone to death like it says in a Bible how can you find something funny out of that beat beat him up by my Carlos I roll beat him up again he's just a little yeah he can't help him so anybody who takes a bath in the sink but he's expect what he's washing his balls 10 past 10 at 5 60 WCM happy money and spite of it all we go on baby we go on we go on right mo you bet we got the big mo walk by my mental hall this morning had a very strange moment he was in there talking to clearance in the doorway yeah and I think that thing was like halfway down his shoulder I get his wake I guarantee that things alive it's moving hey we ever presented with an opportunity when you'd should have cut it or whatever done something but you didn't do it well there's an incredible fanyman mortgage rate out there at 3.45 percent the rates available by calling financial group toll free 1-800-94053-63 if you had to compare a 7% rate with 3.45 percent you'd save $3,500 and the first year loan for $300,000 that you owe $100,000 is only $447 a month out of your pocket so here's an opportunity that ain't got a last long because it's a 40-year low if you're thinking about refinancing or buying a home do the smart thing right now not stupid be smart call financial group toll free at 1-800-94053-63 the process is simple to call as free 1-800-940-L-E-N-D financial group has been an equal housing lender to thousands of borrowers with

don't be playing that 74.60 reason or do you have any idea how god damn hot that is for on the inside here almost 75 degrees here's the fact this is dunia all of your show you the only person in this market who says the truth absolutely correct except of course for George when he's on but he's too lazy to do it all the time because it's uh yeah it's a cop-up I just wanted to let you know that not all media people are crazy I'm a journalist and I refuse underlined in a cap of letters refused to use my degree in self-loaded uh or any US radio market good for you I think the media should do a service to the people not a disservice like self-loaded US media see you in Canada have a great day and back to your sir thank you man and on your team we won't get one call because the pants of people first of all never call anyway but this thing about toast it all is not a big deal he did the stuff in between periods but it's just a principle of it again you can't say crap you can't say

something to say underline the almost part 567560 the catch got there tons again I realized that the public is in mourning a nation in what is it say where's that what I keep doing that here it is I keep trying to sit on it not good for my roads I'll tell you that a nation in pain big big headline on the Sun Sentinel today and I'm looking at this something what are you people talking about have only been through enough already here did we already have 911 have only been through enough grief and agony and scare tactics why is it it's it's it's like the media is telling us what we're supposed to feel that's what pisses me off that's the new deal now the media tells us how we're supposed to do I say this a long time ago like with alien and I said this is a child custody case it's not a big deal oh no this is ever but and and they made a big they did pick and choose what we're supposed to react to and let me tell you this luckily our audience which are a little more independent minded than most we got 73% who said so far it was a tragedy but she made happens but that they don't like that see you're supposed to be a ingrown witness you're supposed to be 24 hours switching back between MSNBC and FoxFascius News and CNN back in fourth and fourth and fourth and like your whole life is supposed to be bogged down in this love is if you're going to learn something new and even if they do learn something new you'll find out that the light was any highlighted with TWA 800 most of them they'd lie through their teeth we're never going to find out the real answer on that to 174 votes a hundred ninety nine said it was a tragedy but she made happens how were you personally impacted by the disaster 45 say somewhat very great or twenty or greatly twenty one a seven and a half percent of not all nine but with a media you think it would be like ninety nine point nine percent greatly impacted like uh the end of the world and just uh the three of us uh and she made happens you know see uh we're gonna go on a revolution against the media whatever you say we're gonna do the opposite if you say jump we're gonna lie down if you say don't do drugs we're gonna like shoot up yeah not just light up will shoot up well that's you American way anyway in it I got my little piece right here baby guys see it I got my little plastic piece that's right I don't paint that baby black I'm gonna make that piece hopped off his forehead tomorrow here's dear field beach hello yes sir okay um I have to agree to one hundred percent these people do knew what they were doing and they it was

and peccops in the York during 9-11 I mean when you have a dangerous job they're gonna be times unfortunately we have a bunch of people we're gonna die 100% correct sir one other thing that hurts me

an independent concert promoter and Denver's come forward with certain court what many have been afraid to say out loud that music industry giant clear channel communications runs any legal monopoly that thorns competition that's the only correct filing an anti-trust student Denver federal court laid money at the in last week nobody in particular presents or NPP a small promotions firm that over the years as handle local concerts for parole jam uh Sarah McLaughlin and the Beastie boys among others charges the company with using monopolistic predatory and competitive business practices now we already talked about them on the front it's nothing but a monopoly like I said destroying a radio industry and a constant industry in the billboard industry and new name it thanks to our friends and a federal government who just say hey we never met a monopoly we didn't like five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T and Verizon line guess who died by the way George the pressing news thank god for these passes by the way keeping coming i the phone is dead as a day Anthony isley no no best remember this half of television's glamor's detective doing the series Hawaii and I died Wednesday he was 78 no death was enough died Wednesday and this is from the AP today I guess it was a little slow kind of like Dr. Laura's mother isley played traces steel to Robert Conrad's Tom Lopak in the show don't you remember that Hawaii and I I don't either the show which ran from fifty nine to sixty three also starred Connie Stevens as cricket Blake and Ponzi Ponce as taxi driver Kazoo O Kim the show frequently had crossovers with 77 Sunset strip I easily originally build as threat isley to one of our other changes name to Anthony isley for the Hawaiian I rule but again is TV career in the 1950s without appearances on operation secret the real McCoy's and Perry Mason almost makes me want to reach for those theme CDs you know or maybe that's looking at this phone let's play all the TV themes today and that will go up and down a whole thing and find out what's objectionable about every comedy but we've got which ones are racist which ones are anti-Somantic which ones are anti-Hulio sexist disgusting vulgar grotesque indescent here's sunrise hello hey Neil um you just took me off my top of for a second I want to say I've got the Laura is got to be the most despicable person I've ever even heard she's in the running the worst I mean she's uh um on the space thing do you think um now we should come back to your amount of money we spend on on on sending these these shuttles up there no okay um no because with this administration power believe me Mars is starting to look pretty good all right I just thought that maybe we could take some of that money and put it somewhere else and then lay off the space thing for a couple years no all right I think I think all we got to do is eliminate the tax cuts for the rich and there will be all the money you're looking for right there well I mean let's talk about something that may happen you know oh we know that's never gonna happen yeah good point okay thanks thank you Neil okay that takes care of calls again for today another Monday and Perry dice now they're Monday I'm all whipped up to a frenzy it seems that the calls are in direct proportion in other words the opposite if I'm whipped up to a frenzy like this morning then there's nobody on the phone pretty much and if I come in like that then all of a sudden they're all whipped up we're just not whipping it together that's the problem you know you're out of sync out of exactly out of sync like Justin out of sync 5 6 7 0 5 60 let's see oh no during the chase lies Friday the post of trucks are more on call than the channel 6 news claiming to be one

kind of crap happens I'm not a fan of his and I like him at all I'm a lot of fans right and let me tell you the only reason why I look into him is because you're coming right after him there you go I

Neil Roger I only talked you Leslie i've never met the guy for the short part of your session that our inside what there is go get to go got ready ken 447 at 550 got ready everything we know about the So what if some fat dumb fat unparcalled someone a jubit? It's not news, no one cares. What if it was the truth? Has anyone considered that? Take Dr. Laura, she is a jubit, which we agree with that? Take Mo Howard David, he's a jubit to just ask anyone who ever waited on him in a restaurant, it says. Jews, speaks, niggers, crackers, guinea's wipes, it's all part of Americana just like moms, Apple pie, sign prejudice in Miami. There you go. I've been telling the public that for years, words are words, baby. But everybody's uptight and boy, if you say something about our organization, we'll never get one call on that, you know what? I'm that toasting and it just frost my ass. It burns my toast. And I don't even know who Daly is other than I see him up there in between, you know, on a big stjumbo trion, he doesn't okay, John. He's better than our goofball that we had from a power over your next term. Remember him, we used to have to do that, what's his name? Tony Thicker, Tony Thicker. Not a bad guy, but he was so out of his element, he did what, one or two games and I ripped him on here and he like resigned his position. Of course, I think we know what his position is, but nevertheless, freaky Carlos told me what his position was, but I'm not gonna repeat it. What do you mean laughing about, huh? You're a little squirt. We know what your position is in the sink. In the sink, next time I can, in fact, tomorrow morning, I might just walk in here real quick and just punch down that thing, punch the plunger down and let you go right down the drain. Might as well the rest of us are here, right down the drain. I might just do all the bedtime stories the rest of it because I can see I can pump it and squeeze it and yank it and twist it. There ain't gonna be nothing going on this phone. Nothing. We got one call here, one at a time. Here's Boca, hello. Neil? Yes sir. For am I okay? No, you're just about holding on, but listen. What do you mean by that? Well, you got, you can't have that hands on the table. Here I'm not holding on to it. Well, I think you should go back to no calls. You were to talk of conversation over the weekend at a party and we really enjoy it. You know what? Enjoy you, not these other assholes that are calling during the day and trying to screw up your day. Yeah. You don't want? Go back to no calls and teach them a lesson. What do you mean teach them a lesson? Well, what does that mean? Well, I'll keep them off the air because they don't appreciate the genius that you are. No, it's not just that. It's just that they have nothing to say. It's not a question to be an genius or a moron. It's that they have nothing to say about anything. Here it is 27 years later. And I still haven't figured out that they have nothing to say. It's that the same old crap. Well, an animal, maybe they need it. OK. Goodbye. Goodbye. Well, he was a little porked off. OK. He's a good boy. Bye. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Not going to get to me, Mr. I'll take that right now. Not going to bother me. Just deliver that check. Next Monday is payday. Brog, you will write in here what I check clearance. And I'll also write over the bank that I have to do. And on it goes on and on and on for another month or two. I mean, for however long I can tolerate it. I mean, what they've done to this place. I'm serious. There are people on debt. This is the truth. There are people on debt's row for less one. They management of this place has done to it. In the last year and the last year. And even though that bit that I played before about the night at 10 hour, even at bit and spoof a lot we had on before we'd run up the Hershey Highway, you know something a year ago at this time. And spite of all of the angst we were going through here. The ratings were a pretty damn good. Winter book a year ago. They were like, remember that? And a gigantic girl got an over. Maybe because of all the confusion I was going on. I don't know who knows why it was. They were tuned in to see what's it going to be this day. Who's going to be on tomorrow today? Is it going to be running a Hershey Highway? Is it going to be Carolyn? Is it going to be guilty? Is it going to be default with or without the ankle bracelet? Well, you know, what is it? What's it going to be? So we kept them on their toes. We had a Mark Van der Mer one day. And then just a really shock him. Once in a while we'd stick in there too to really piss him off. You know? Who else did we have in there? Where are everybody that would like within a 10 block radius? In fact, if radius would have shown up, we'd have put him on a year too. With it without his toothbrush. 5, 6, 7, that last guy think had a good point. Go back to the bedtime stories, Neil. Teach these people a lesson. Everybody else is losing their freedom of speech. These people have got their freedom of speech. And they still have another to say. And that's something. That's the best part of it. Just waiting till Uncle Sam comes along and says, oh, we can have any more telephone talk shows because who knows what these people are. And they might even criticize the government. And we can't tolerate that. Here's Pemberpine, hello. Neil, I think you're right. I think that these people are traumatized with what Bush is up to. And that leaves too big a problem in general that they just don't care. Nobody speaks up. Because if they did care about the abortion issues, they care about the economy. They certainly care about the stock market. If they don't. They don't. They care about the way you're show is also. Yeah. You know, the fact of the matter is you're absolutely right. You have your piss and vinegar back. And nobody's calling anymore. Right. I agree. I mean, you know, your show is five times better than it was six, eight months ago. Right. And at this point, you know, I can't even believe where what happened to all the clothes including the cock on moon lady. She died. She did she really? Yeah. Oh, God, I never, I'm sorry. Yeah, you should be. No, not in the head and the way not. No, but anyway, but anyway, we'll feel bad the well day about having said that. She was dynamite. She was. She was, she was classic. But Neil, seriously, please let the call was coming. Your show is great. I don't know. Anyway, even George is good, although I swear to you, he's a closet pack. Is he really? Okay, not my type. And why do you hang up right after he said that? I would let him continue. I think the audience would be interested in here more about his theories. George doesn't carry drinking a free snapper. He don't give her crap. As long as it's free. Yeah, that's all in it. What does that mean? You know, the whole marriage and the kids and everything. Oh, I see. There we go. Is it good? Why are you responding to him? He was okay. He just wanted to take a little bit of a just response. No, you're not. You're getting all defensive and all psyched. Yes, you are. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a defensive. You're not attacking me. By the way, next time a treasure island, a week from Wednesday, George is bringing this boyfriend. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Keep him guessing, okay, George, that's the way to do it. Keep him guessing. Keep him off balance. Just like, no, you never know which piece he's going to have on on a given day. Every day comes in. Is it going to be the purple one, the yellow one? Okay, the blue one. Here's Oakland Park, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I wanted to call and let you know I'm on my way to Roger Dean Stadium. I'm going to go with the Caravan today. Stop by stop and support our local baseball team. Go about what stadium? Oh, the the mountains are having their kick off to the season as a caravan through Palm Beach County. So we're going up to Roger Dean. And that's where it started. Jimmy, you have stadium? Yeah, three Jimmy Dean. Three Jimmy Dean hot dogs today. Yeah. And we'll be able to meet the players, sign autographs, all that good stuff. It's happening at 1130 to 130 and then they move. So we know who many of the players are besides Pugge. I noticed that Pugge has got a big statue of himself in front of his house. Did you see that? Yep, I did see the statue on the inner crystal down and forward. Well, we don't mention how old things they money are. 560, 560, 560, 560, on the idiot. You didn't see that Pugge has got a huge statue of himself in front of his Miami Beach home. It's a little Pugge, but we've got a huge ass. And then I read that thing that one article about how he's not going to be here very long. Well, what did that mean? So in other words, this is just another one of those deals where they like, yeah, they don't want to really pay them all that money. They're just going to use them as trade bait, put them on a big hook, have to be a big heavy hook. I'll take it that way. We love your Pugge no matter what they say. Okay, I thought he was going to play in Japan, George. You were telling me all about that. And what about all the calls about toast? The Panther organization fires the toast marcher. They'd be like, if Stanley Panther, Stanley, see Panther here to say, oh, I thought that trades suck. I like Sandwood, Josellinch. You know? And by the way, Stanley, did you see him lined up to shake hands with the players at the end of the game yesterday? I almost peed my pants. They get the, they get them with a shootout, the game is over. And everybody's all excited about how great it turned out. And the players line up, like they do with the end of the play, Austin, they're shaking each other's hand. And Stanley, see Panther is in the line up. And actually a couple of players shook his hand. Which I thought would nice God Stanley, you're okay in my book, but don't knock the organization because you'll be out. You'll be out fast and then you can butter your toast. Okay, sweetheart.

It came over California Minutes before they saw pieces already falling off So it was breaking up like 250,000 feet in the air or more Surface the air missiles have a maximum range of 10 to 15,000 feet This is up there 240 or 50,000 feet Plus it's traveling at many many times the speed of light Sound Don't those guys have those magic carpets that can fly real high advanced And everything about that We'll have to check that out Could it be terrorism related? Could it have been like a suicide bomber on there you think? Oh my god It's a miracle that there's any mental health left in America the media is going now Families families in mourning What a surprise you know families are in mourning if you're losing their loved ones Isn't that shocking? It's a bulletin It's breaking news Here's a call from sunrise hello Yes, it's totally ridiculous I mean they're just pushing this whole thing to the whole As far as they can go and the wire is they can carry it They're milking it I mean this is what they do milking and exploiting tragedy That's what really pisses me off What more is there to say? Right It's no no there's no way off the go The way you try to stretch it and you know you trying to hide the fact of the economy stuck Right You know when the verge of going to war and you know start a war that's going to lead to got only knows what And at the same time this is all they can talk about In fact if you to watch TV network news all we can long you to thought that's Adam Hussein And some of your mom never existed Yeah Yeah After that But I just wanted to hopefully I heard you talking about something about somebody Finding a anti trust suit against a company I want to know if FK and elk consider them monopoly Yes Okay Nobody's doing that You want to sue them?

No How many dead seven Casualies on a ground unknown but unlikely I Find myself ranking this tragedy in a context of recent i'mrsness Sedans me The loss of the shuttle Columbia is a terrible event But it is not the cataclysmic suffering Offering that we fear awaits us The men and women who lost their lives were heroes The angra bababa I remember in 1986 when the space shuttle challenged your exploded 10 miles high And in Florida sky I was in my last year at Colorado State University Sitting in a political science lecture when a student ran out of the classroom and scream The shuttle exploded the astronauts are dead they're dead 17 years later I can still hear those words Still see that young woman's face I remember the gasp and the tears the prayers ended this belief Did you cry when the challenger blew up? No Ask me if I cried No I went to the student center watch the challenger explode a hundred times on a jumbo TV screen I couldn't move I couldn't think I was stunned and pain At took the events of nine eleven for me to feel I waged I stared at my TV for the hours as the towers from above above above above Saturday shuttle is actually let me work and fuse then pain Oh I mean this column is enough to make me barfe I tell myself I haven't drawn on the death of the astronauts Because I don't need the additional pain such thoughts would bring But if I'm honest with myself I worry that even if I try I won't deal bad enough I know it's wrong to compare one of that with the other but the repetition of horizontal world has made me And I suspect that someone hardened at this late strategy I say that this knowing how poorly this reflects on me and with no disrespect to the men and women of the shuttle Columbia lost their lives and the pursuit of science and others they deserve better than I'm able to give them 17 years ago I went for a shuttle crew that died in the ball of fire Saturday I felt like crying because I didn't Oh I remember how many times you voted on our pool about movies that made you cry Do you think they make them right? I don't know what that I'll tell you one thing they don't make them like they used to 267 figure that out. You think about it 26 after eleven and five six team get I'll choke that from this room again I think I think both got the poison gas In here either that he dropped his bag right outside the door in an active defiance just before he left the building think that could be it So we talk about our net show is about this one's a big hit and that one did this and this one's a big hit and blah blah blah blah stuff like that Thank God thank the Lord That we got no a bigotry on at you 4K fills in for the pipes woke at this morning at 9 o'clock Hey guys, guess what women really want about times they agreed to put little fun creativity into your gift This year expressed yourself in a fun and original way and sit with a Vermont teddy bear just call 1-800-829 beer and a friendly bear council will help you choose from over 100 beers and Corrected in Vermont delivered in the couple gift box with a free card and chalk with tell her she likes your fire with the new burning love bear Dressed like a honky fireman with a love tattoo on his arm or say I'm wild about you with a jungle love bear They even have an officially licensed love me tender Elvis bear Sending your Vermont teddy bear is creative and personal alternative to flowers and it'll be around a long time active Valentine's day to remind her of you Sending a birthday office so that her coworkers can see how tough our manicure is a great idea to overnight and Valentine's day delivery be guaranteed Call 1-800-829 beer or shop online at Vermont teddy bear dot com this year state with a runtimey bear for Valentine's day and be sure and tell them that all of Neil told you to call 1-800-829 BEAR Stay baby Oh That's so fun and good is to be the perfect fat hole Don't want to hear about it alone I'm better with the media blitz we know everything about the pitch we need to go I don't fall to see the next belly home We hundred pound the page the boss The stock boys think that's pitch on us everybody's had a dump of that big fat hole I don't really care about who she blows What else can you say?

I've seen that thing so many times Even you turn on the comedy channel and they're showing that you turn on the sci-fi channel. They're showing it You turn on the game show channel and thank god they're the ones that are show like programs I'm I would even watch a show with Bert Convey that's how desperate I am to see something beside this and I'd rather croaked in much Bert Convey even though he's you know he did he've croaked You want to say I don't like your convey. He's not he just I don't know something about him. I didn't like him. Was it the hair or you know who else? I can't stand game show guy Chuck Swillery. Oh, huh. Now. What's that show kind of lingo?

Oh, watch the game show channel He knows his game shows Mr. Okay, all right then let him answer but at any rate Well now what that was I just say about Bert Convey and who's this other clown Chuck Swiller it's Chuck Swillery Chuck Swillery was the original host of one of the great shows one of the great money makers that made more of Griffin as which he's today and law before there was any pattern Anna squeal fortune and when he was on it it was a bomb it was like On a verge of going off the air because that's how bad Chuck Swillery is the public just they see him whether it's a quesio Whether it's a commercial whether he's just walking through them all and they start swooning man They see him on TV and they start hitting that button so hard that they're remote control falls apart the button start popping off They just don't like Chuck Swillery.

I keep finding them and gig all the time He'd be good mornings here Here's Carl Gables. Hello, how are you doing pretty good? I'm doing okay and spider this place. Yeah, you know, I don't you know want to be a program director I like the breakup. I like the morning the comedy hour that you did the first hour. That's that's excellent I like a few bad times story. It breaks it up and your colors are killing us here But thanks for doing that. I appreciate that you made a very silly and point a little while ago that I'd like to make a comment Siring point It's about the administration and the press. You're really working hard to get us depressed and I think that this is it's part of a repeat pattern pattern of reoccurring pattern. I think this is a preview to get us ready for a lot bomba baby You could get us ready to go into and bomb the crap out of Baghdad. Yes, it's that kind of whole bunch of people Yes, and it's great cover for all of the refutations about the more of this evidence that the Bush administration supposedly have evidence Right, you can't complain about the evidence because they don't have any Right, well and it's also I believe part of the obfuscation of the warnings prior to the accident just like 9-11 One of those alchite guys wants to go flight that past right over Baghdad because didn't land or anything but he passed right over Right, right. He was you know, he was an extradited and you know, but they threw him out But yet that's harboring things bigger got pissed when he had something to do with Passover And don't forget that this so called alchite a gas plant is a weapons of mass destruction that they have is in the U.S. protected zone in the northern alliance area Very interesting, but anyway, I just wanted to point out that part of the obfuscation of this action is the we have no idea sort of rhetoric that we're hearing Just like after 9-11 when the evidence has turned out that they did have an idea and the reason why I'm saying this is that the MSNBC reported this morning That the panel that NASA had assembled to research the possible damage from this foam in the enton launching They weren't in internal memo that was leaked this morning of a 1.5 foot section of tiles that were missing Right, the leading edge of this wing and there are there are alternate there You know NASA's one of the most amazing groups of people that had the as you remember on Apollo 13 They have incredible capabilities to save people and to get them back here This shuttle could have docked with a space station it was outfitted with a caller and there are methodologies of returning crew members back to Earth without using the shuttle And the Russians have a very capable system and this is what this panel has recommended Well, that's not what they were saying over the weekend. They were saying that once it took off they had no longer had the there was a problem with it They didn't have the ability to dock it Well, you know, this is what the panel had recommended that they could have been parked there After not could have been launched up to the space station where they could have repair these tiles and not risk this now Of course this would have taken six months to nine months to do this Yeah, but there are methods of retrieving crews and getting them back up on the York Times today He's got a great story NASA dismissed advisors who were about safety which I'll get to an event That's the way it always goes man. I know I could add part of the other cover up is there If you pay attention on Friday nights this administration releases all of the horrific news like the Medicare cuts the 18% Medicare Right, but and the changing of the regulations regarding over time after 40 hour work We're tapping your phone right now, man. I want to get your nervous, but they're tapping your phone or tracing this call Well, I wouldn't I wouldn't doubt that's an eye on your door.

I said this missed advisors who were about safety this in the days New York Times to find a whole article on our website. When an expert NASA panel warned last year that safety troubles loomed for the fleet of shuttles at the agency's budget was not increased, NASA removed five of the panel's nine members in two of its consultants. Some of them now say, the agency was trying to suppress their criticisms. A sixth member were retired three star admiral Bernard M. Couture were self-centered to firing that he quit the group, NASA's aerospace safety advisory panel at group of industry and academic experts charged with monitoring safety at the space agency. NASA said it changed the chart of the group so that new members younger and more skilled could be edited, and had nothing to do with shooting the messenger said Sony Alexandria spokesman and S. Edward is in Washington. Members of Congress who heard testimony from the panel last spring said yesterday they would re-examine whether budget constraints had undermined safety but several said they doubted it. Right. Dr. C. Morsee, him, a little bit fired from the advisory panel said yesterday, we were telling it like it was and we're disagreeing with some of the agency's actions and as a result, by by they're out. And you like I said we'd the whole article on neowargers.com. NASA dismissed advice is more about safety these New York Times got it good. Well, I'd tell you we can sure make a difference on this show like that bitch that called you that day. Remember? Of course. We could make a difference. Look at that phone matter.

Couldn't get the adult at the Furacoon as he back on. Hello. Anya, sorry. And you want to know something I do have a tremendous point to make. Excellent. Okay. I've had some interludes with some of the law enforcement in South Florida. As I said, let me tell you something. There is a group of police officers in every department. Yeah. And I say probably 50, 60 percent that are there the most corrupt. They break every law there is. Okay. Yeah. And I experience this first hand. They make up a wise. Yeah. They do whatever they can to build their case even if they don't have them on against you. Whatever it takes. Let me tell you something.

Sounds like a good idea. I'm going to show you how to do it. I can do a blow by blow on it. Here's a call from candle. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Speaking. Love this one of the show. I just called it way in on the paper or plastic pulp. I'm just kidding. Hey, listen. If I really did it, I'd still have trouble getting calls because it's Monday. You know? Over the weekend. I had to think about it. I definitely wanted to weigh in. Sure. I had to call for another reason. But the cops down here suck. Yeah. I had a buddy who was a cop and he quit because he couldn't get along with him. He told me he says, man, you wouldn't believe. In the off-hours, what the cops do. They, they party just as hard. Just as illegal. Just as dirty with stripper's drugs, horse, everything. And they're time off. And they get to do it legally. You know, that's why these people become hard. How about that? How about that. Horing. We had down there in candle and all over the day. I was listening to you about that. I'm going to put anything in the newspaper. It's about. We had one little tiny article and they swept that out of the rug. And then there was like a little follow up about 18 words in between the obituaries. And that was the end of that. They, they, they, they, they, quite, that thing up like. You never saw. They were, you were, they swine about it two years ago. They were working that girl around the corner. I wasn't just one girl. And I know either, but they were under age girls. They were minors. They're minors. Yeah. This, this town. I mean, there's a fine line between law enforcement and secured. And where's the way to investigate journalism? I kept screaming and screaming and hollowing. Where do I know all these great people in television and news papers here with all their budgets they got for investigative journalism? Where do I know how was the follow through on it? Not a thing, man. Somebody got to the right people somewhere. They were writing puff pieces. Yeah. Even though I wanted to call you over the weekend, I saw a great show on channel two about the history of radio. And it was with these guys. Well, that, that would make me cry. Sorry, no. And deforest. I wonder if. If the forest is related to that guy. But they was a very fascinating show how they had, you know, bought us to be mass produced. I never knew what A M and F M stands for. Now I know. We know what it stands for now. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Not, you know, that clear channels here at stands for. George does a great job. He's sensational man. I got put in my right now. I love him. Have a great day. Yeah, George is going to do the rest of the month by the way. It's only the third of February you're going to shot at it. What are you laughing about? You'd be a city lady, man. This month you'd be perfect. Just exactly what we need now to bring these people back to reality. And shake them out of their depression. A nation in pain. I'm in pain because my local newspapers here are such crap that even if I had a pericator or a cockatoo, they wouldn't allow me to put the paper in the bottom of the bird cage they'd bite my hand. That's right. If you had a big parrot, you ever see how big a beak is there. If you had like a maca. If you think if you went to like the parrot, John, go ahead and try to stick the arrow to the sun settle at the bottom of the bird cage. They'd snap your hand right off. That's right. Snap your freaking hand right off at that newspaper unit. Swill garbage, a nation in pain. Quick telling us how we're supposed to feel. Just report the news, okay? Quit pretending like everybody's on a verge of suicide now because we had an accident. What I got to him is spatial. It's unfortunate it's tragic. We lost seven lives. It's always said. But the crap happens every day. There are bus accidents when 30 and 40 kids wind up getting killed. And they don't make such a big simis over it. Are their lives worthless less than the astronauts? I don't think so. Or anybody else that gets killed. You people in a media, you're a part of the problem because you're busy sucking a ass of this in the administration. You're going to leave us right down to Garden Pan. You pretend to tell us the truth. You don't tell us squad. You're supposed to be the anti people. You're supposed to ask the tough questions. You're supposed to be the voice of the public. That's the world of the goddamn media. And all they do, how do you like the new deal of the press guy? Every press conference is yuck yuck time. Whether it's with rums fail to airy fly shear. And they make it all a little joke. Have you noticed that? Yes. Well, screw you guys, okay. I hope they're feeding you a lot of good freemials up there in a press corps. You scumbags. You douche bags. Anyway. I know there's no sense of getting worked up because the people don't give a fly in fart anyway. Okay. All I care about is when it early bird starts and are their teeth that are ready to take out of the glass yet. Three minutes till noon at five, 60 WQAM. Snow in Miami unbelievable the Tom Lehman. And his good close pies on Joe Prieto are buried up to their armpits. Up to their ear, eye lobes. And their ear of lids. The fact we have said how it's so many cars, there's no place to stick them. Even Tom Lehman had a park house in his driveway. He's got so many. He loved the place when in yours. And you drive way too. How about is blowing out all the new vehicles regardless of profit right now, including that nifty. Pontiac Vibe starting only 13,998 and you get up to $5,000 off on your GMC on boy and stock plus. Get you zero percent financing, ruptu a $3,000 rebate. Maybe the president will give you like a personal tax rebate if you get a mess you've eat. If he goes a more than like if he if he if he give one to kids like about two miles a gallon. He'll give you a just a whole bag of money. And of course, how let's also go to dependable selection of great use cars, trucks and SUVs. If everybody else in town won't even if they turn their nose up and hear when you walk on their luck because they think you're quite a really blows and maybe it does not a problem in hell.

Listen to the show set of course for those right wingers who are monitoring us. And we welcome them too. Like maybe they ought to read it. They might learn something. Here's McCallow one of our lady listeners who says I wonder we come to short story about the Columbia shuttle as asked you're going to puke when you hear this. Since the disaster happened on Sabbath I decided to call my folks to let them know what had happened. The first thing I was told was this means the Jewish astronaut is dead the rabbi was right. I was closest to what they meant but amits the screams and cries they finally told me that the Jewish astronauts rabbi told them not to travel hence his return on Sabbath. Apparently this topic was something that was being heavily debated along the community. I was beyond disgusted they weren't upset because the disaster had happened. But only because this Jewish astronaut had the audacity to travel on the Sabbath against his rabbi's counsel. Speaksless and browwards his McCallow. Honey, I like that. Huh? Yeah. Oh, oh, oh. 560, 560 on the AT&T in Verizon line. 585 votes. How are you personally impacted by the Columbia shuttle disaster? And we got 405. It was a tragedy but Schmidt happens that's almost 70%. Somewhat impacted 106 18.1. What about your wisdom teeth? Somewhat impacted? A little bit. Very greatly 47 and not at all 27 4.6%. Crap happens man. It's an accident. We're not going to go into mourning. We're not crying. We're not weeping over here. Did you know any of these astronauts? No. See, I'm one of those people. I'm not ordinarily. I mean like 9 level was a different story. It was a grow test gun thousands of people died like 3000 and it was a whole different thing. It was an assault upon all of us. But the fact of the matter is this was an accident. It wasn't an assault on anybody. It was a freaking accident. A nasian in pain. I just keep looking at that thing. Would I dig cross on my front page there? Well, thank you for sprucing it up. I put a star David over it on my thing. Just in case for the one Jewish guy, they is really guy that died. And we don't have, I don't know what to handle. Simplis for the Indian lady. Yeah. I find out we'll draw an on the road run on or even that. You idiots at the Sun, Sonny, you morons.

Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. I tell you, you know, I guess the dog would be a symbol for the Indian. A dog? A dog? A dog? But other than that, is our countryside going to be lit with little crosses now, wherever it's a piece of debris found? I thought we got done doing that by the way. Didn't they upset about the people who put the crosses out on the highway? Well, these things are going to be like all over Texas, as if they weren't enough already. Yeah, good point. I'm talking about the administration just changed. There was a thing yesterday, a Sun Sentinel, not written by the Sun Sentinel about the, the super-card, the 80 mile per gallon card that was started 10 years ago. And the Bush administration obviously swatched it two years ago with the auto industry, because they said, well, people want us to use. And Christ will have the call. That is in the Christ, they have Christ's own museum. Yeah. It was in the yesterday's Bay, was just kind of interesting reading. And one last thing, not about the shuttle, there was this program on the way, Michael Kington, about the, his fan of the house. Oh, damn it. I forgot to watch that. I read the Jika wrote a piece about that. Not the one of his puppies, not the one of his shoes, but I read it was going to be pretty good. I thought it was pretty good. In the first 15 minutes, you had two Mexican drug dealers grabbing their crotch as yelling at people. You don't have wave balls. Oh, right. Yes. That's my kind of show. It's on again two things.

It was a tragedy but Schmidt happens 423 69.3% Some what 110 18% Very greatly 48 7.8% And not at all 29.5% Crap happens Since it had completed that Refurbishment so in this regard Seriously there are days when I feel like I might lose my mind from the media I'm glad I took this poll today And that is coming out overwhelming Because it can't just possibly be me I'm not that insensitive I'm not that much of a hard ass I'm not that much of a bonehead But good, golly Miss Molly give it a rest There's got to be something else going on in the world Got a mail truck being hijacked on Friday See it in horror in Miami Here we are right here where we're going They went right past the building Was there anybody horrified? Anybody like fearful for their lives? The people of power a little bit nervous They thought they got one and make a request They thought it was coming by the building But other than that Horror in Miami got a damn it Scream Come on get a step Here's West Palm Beach Hello Good morning Neil Yes you're good after them Hey that king can show is really good It's believable You know not like when he's cheesy Typical thing that you see putting on So I recommend that Now let me ask you Erica straddle wasn't it was he? No, I don't know why he's here You don't know why he's here Okay But you know names The picture on the front page of the Palm Beach Putts had a big area of shot That mail truck hijacking And I counted quickly over 50 police cars Surrounding that truck when they finally pulled it over What was watching it donuts? Good point let me ask you one other thing How come they had those schools all closed down To late in the afternoon? They knew that this guy had one other accomplice And they already had him in custody And the guy they had already shot the tires out on the mail truck He wasn't going anywhere Why did they have all those kids like in school And prevent their parents from going and picking them up? I just want to understand why they needed 50 cars in case one Yeah a little bit of overkill But what I call them out? Yes sir I called you about a month ago And I brought this up and I'm bringing it up again And I'll probably call you another month on it And that is my assertion that did lots of debt I keep hearing you referring to the fact that he out there on the loose stuff I don't keep saying he's out there on the loose stuff I haven't got any idea I never said that I said I don't know You keep making remphorses I'm not going to waste my time Every month you're going to call me again How do you know? Every month he's going to call us back and tell us That no thanks will pass Just send us a fax I can when the last time I said he's out there running around Did I say that? Whatever We don't know We have no idea And the fact is he's not the issue The fact is that all kites be organizing They keep admitting that They're out there That's right He's not the one who flew the planes into the world of the trade center Or the Pentagon They're out there and they're reorganizing They're getting ready to do their crap And that's your people that are telling us that So what are you talking about? Just gotta call me next month to tell me the same thing See you sir I was wrong with radio talk shows Like Dennis and you and the same The same little core of Jackass's Callin' who feel compelled to say the same thing Over and over again Every day, every week, every month Ooh cares Like that one punk I called up Orlando last night and told him this And he repeats the same thing He told Orlando on the station a few hours before Who wants to hear it again? Probably wasn't that important to me Said the first time he's gotta repeat it again? Oh my god Virgin Mary makes guess the parents are crowded I'll straight in beach The Virgin Mary or a figure resembling the traditional image of her made an appearance before a thousand of spectators at a crowded beach suburb In Australia Whether fake optical illusion or genuine religious vision Remained an unsolved riddle But for an hour and three quarters in mid-afternoon The apparition was cited on a fence post At the northern tip of the beach at Kugi Kugi Now you think she lost your flavor on a fence post overnight? Was you worried traditional beachwear? Several thousand spectators Some beat a lever, some curious others skeptical Turn out to watch after several sightings Were widely publicized here last week In Kugi, Australia Some expressed amazement by what they saw Others were disappointed Diana Kawati of Morubra was emotional and teriyad And she put it out the vision to friends I saw it last week this is my second time I've come to see her In other words, she's just hanging out there out of a fence post Can't get to get much accomplished there, I don't think It feels so good that our dear Virgin Mary is with us She's trying to get it this close to a god or son and lord Jesus Christ She believed the apparition brought a message of pieces The world prepares for a war But Tony, Teriyov, Subred and Strathfield said It didn't really matter what message she was trying to bring Different people see different things he said They reckon she shows up in different coloured shawls Sometimes blue, other times maroon Another local girl, Natalie Wysabek Agreed, it doesn't matter because everybody gets a different message She said, I think it's amazing that so many people are gathered And once bought to see her Like Pasta Son, our Pasta Tony Phil Yeah, that's amazing 30,000 people came out in Pennsylvania over the weekend To see Pasta Tony Phil who saw his shadow Or did he, I don't know how that goes He said it's going to be six more weeks of winter, what he said 30,000 people Showed up to see a groundhog, okay? Not that there are people who are superstitious These are just people who really want to say I have no light Right Better than playing golf anyway It depends on what angle or whether you were squinting your eyes But it gives happiness to people and it doesn't matter why she's here It says Perhaps the happiest person of all with the man selling picture Postcards of the Virgin Mary And flowers just meters away from the apparition For people to place it the base of the fence Post at $2 each, that's $1 US Now we're talking And Gary Quinn of Hocking with Sconson The US said referred to the many bikini-clad girls on the beach I saw an apparition, all right, but it wasn't Mary Now we're talking, there you go, girl Oh right Mary can for you, good gone Wow 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 Here's a call from West Palm Beach, yellow Oh, the last one, you have to say What is it? I've got the last one, the color of the instrument Neil Yes sir I was up the game, I thought it was a lot of past We give it to those ones, it's a great car Great car It was great, it's a standing-go-vation It's a very kind of touchy situation It's a kind of beat-air What is it? I think Coach Keaton really did him Wrong way for some reason Yeah Why couldn't he have waited for the latest He did a straight or whatever I'll tell you one thing, Coach Keaton I'm reversing my opinion about him He did a great job in Boston with Joe Thornton And I was at he done a great job here with Oli Okin And that said he wants to trade Christian who's Evious He doesn't like Bobby LeWango who's a tremendous gold tender I know what that least thinking about He wanted to sense the wife down in the miners Rick Dudley had a role in keeping up here He was one hell of a little player, he's great I think he's losing his mind, maybe too much sun Well, I'm what he's the great coach of course Well, maybe he was once a great coach But he sure is hell isn't here He's making one guy into a real star It doesn't mean you're a great coach There you go, but I think it should be And it's also different There's no way he should make a trade Christian and I felt starter going to a different kind of...
