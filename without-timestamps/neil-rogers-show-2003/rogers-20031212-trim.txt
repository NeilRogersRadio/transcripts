Why did you wear Steve? Bill Clinton was exposed as an adulterer. One of his goals may have been to humiliate me publicly, but now is my turn to show him what I had discovered. On that auspicious day, lunch was served on the grounds under an enormous white canvas tent. One of my challenges that afternoon was Fidel Castro. There was a mischievous gleam in his eye. Then he said something that left me in awe. Hillary, I have a picture of you in my office. Mmm, delicious! Almost immediately, we crashed into bed. It was wonderful to lose myself in sheer physical sensation. A few days later, Steve wondered, called and asked if he could come over to see me at the White House. I answered, yes, you must come to see me. That night, I was ushered upstairs until the Putonic Wig and Hoops skirt. And he periodically broke into giggles for no apparent reason. I'm not all that athletic anymore, but the next thing I knew I was swinging back and forth, squealing. When Steve finished, I felt numb. Another surprise soon followed, Palma Cartney, George Harrison, and Nick Jagger. Bill didn't mind. After all, it happens. It sure does, you go, girl. 10, 0, 1, 5, 16, WQM, happy Friday to you. You were right, I was wrong. It takes a big fat man to admit it. You were right. It'll come any bigger, Fatter. Well, I guess they did. They, I'm in a right place for that. When you're in South Florida, no matter how old you get, that's one part, you're still a youngster. Yes. You're a spring chicken, and no. No matter how fat you are, QM, you've got lots and lots. People will make you look like rumple stills, demand big fat tubby people. But you were right about the fact that they'd been put on at the same time, and then it would have won the 9, 11 thing. Oh, yes. Well, we didn't. So we gave kind of a handy camp. And we had little, a little note of no interest to George, but just some just for a point of information. And the Toronto Sun yesterday, here's the little burb on the sports page. Bruins, one panther's one and it says, the panther's offered season ticket holders, four free tickets to the game, and an effort to fill the arena with NHL Commissioner Gary Bedman and attendance. There were 17,465 tickets distributed, although the crowd appeared to be no more than half that size. That's what it said, both in the Sun and the Star here yesterday. Where truth, of course, makes a little bit of difference. As opposed to the U.L. propaganda, you get from the shields like Mike Russo and David J. Neal. And very badmasses. Oh, I didn't need to have any of that done, because I watched your games on TV. Oh, ho ho ho ho. At a boy Gary, if I'd like to get a nose job, you idiot. You've simpleed in you. So there you go. So the beast, I guess, is being generous, of course he likes generous portions. So when he called in yesterday's said, or maybe 12,000 people ever done a game, he was exaggerating just a wee bit, maybe about 50%. Anyway, 1446 votes on yesterday's poll. Oh, got the new inquiry to there, I should point out. Wow. Got some stuff in there, including, I'm even going to do an article about Lacey and Stacey and Macy, which we've, a situationally avoid talking about that. Yeah, so why you're going to know. Because it's important stuff, it's as Lacey was smothered. Scott Kilder and her sleep cops chilling evidence. Got the new Michael Jackson crap. By the way, what was on last night was not your main to the case. And all that's gets serious. Oh, you talk about what you say yesterday. It's all spin all the time. Not just that story, but every story. It's all spin politics, Michael Jackson, you name it. The spin doctors hard at work to manipulate public opinion. While the public is busy shopping till they drop going. Like that, who's Scott Peterson and who to help wash it, I really care. And we get a little bit more on Hill Pop and Rush quite a bit more as a matter of fact. Chuckle. No, I love the headline. Can I find headline in the new inquiry? Could you please web closing in on Rush? A rap, police web. Oh, right. Blacks, is they're just trying to smear him and make him look bad. Yes, smear this Roy. It's all fishing, expedition. Smear this Roy. 1446 votes on yesterday survey. What news of other the past 50 years had the most significance to you? Before we get the results on, here's our very first important call from Lion6QAM. Recyl, I heard. George W. Bush deals the 2000 election for 113 votes. 9-11 which we didn't put until nearly the end of the show. 360-2. You're right if we'd have put them on simultaneous side by each. A lot of people would like to have changed their vote. Because originally the poll said other than 9-11. Because we assumed, automatically, when by a landslide, we put it on right near the very end of that was my bad. Or maybe it was my bad punter on it all. JFK assassination was a strong 3171. Hurricane Andrew, which also I apologize for putting it on very late, stuck my mind, I'm out of touch 87. Vietnam more 78, collapsed at a Soviet Union 48, Johnlet and Murder 41, the Challenger Explodes 32. Demary Al-Boltlift 31. The Alien saga. The Alien saga. The Alien saga. 28. Berlin Wall comes down 28 Internet Bubble Burst 26. Clinton impeachment 23. Watergate slash Nixon Reservation 17. Elvis Crooks on a Krapers 16. Martin Luther King assassination 16. Prenses Die Dyes. Die Die NU 11. Arnold Schwarzenegger becomes Governor of California 9. And the RK assassination only 6. It's just they just don't care about Bobby Kennedy, I guess. Why is that? I'll see that. That really well. I'm asking personally, and of course they can't tell me what I want to hear. But it just seems to me in terms of significance. Because he was upstage by his brother. Because he's not been assassinated, he would have won the election almost for sure. And we never had Nixon or Watergate and the whole lot of things would have been much different. But then again, if chickens pee, they'd have a wet underside too. So stop and think about that. Let's see. Now this where did this come from? What? This looks like a listener wrote it. Why? Ha ha ha ha. Best of Neil and Joe Mark to a drive with Joe and Mark at singular wireless. At 1920 South University Drive in Davy, new to two today. Is this from a girl? Yes. I see. See, yesterday we did okay. Thanks to the fact that I threatened to put your hands on here today. Would you brought out tons of people? I were like just toppling all over each other. And when looked like we only had 20 bucks there with the shell station. We're on up with 500. What is it? 3. 503. I thought I was misreading my run and where did he get 3? Well, remember he threw in the three bucks. So I guess that's right. 503. So anyway, our total for a van in Paris use getting up there. We'll make 50. 46,000, 148 bucks. We ought to make 100,000, but we won because most of you are cheap backters. And then some of you don't have a job. And some of you, even if you didn't have a really good job, you still wouldn't give a dime. And you've got all kinds of excuses, but that's okay. We're used to that. So anyway, singular wireless and, of course, Joe and Mark always raised tons of cash. Every time I'm in, when they go out, there's nothing like it. You know, when you agree with that, when they go to collect money for us, there is nothing like it. We'll take it. We'll take whatever they get, you're right. So that's known to do today just mention that in passing. Anyway, this very important internal memo, which we try to avoid putting internal memos on here. WQAM, hello. Yes, hello. What is it? What is it? I don't know what my name is Roy. Open park. Oh, let's go to a rock. Okay, park. Hey, how you doing, Roy? Okay. It's one of those things about that. You really have to think that why I say charge in them people with obstruction or, you know, I've just got to be lost. Abstracts are adjusted. That's right. That's a good point. They have to throw their ashes in the slimmer. You're right. They're busy, sue, and people to try to hop on a gravy train and get their skirts and money out of the apartment. In the meantime, they ought to be charged with obstructing justice. Excellent point, Roy. At least they don't think that. Have a good day. And you too. So he's going to quit while he's in here because actually agreed with, well, it's not to agree, right? Right. I think that Maris Grease ass and the rest of her two and let Lazaro and, uh, some of those other drug and my lives, they ought to be in jail. For obstructs and adjusts. But of course, they didn't want to piss off all the old Cubans. Get them all riled up again. And then get all the attorneys that fat Armardo Gugliers out again, and some of those that roll, foul, foul, foul, Sanchez, whatever's the image. Right. What he hears. You notice how some of the most obnoxious people in South Florida have that same last name Sanchez. Well, I apologize to the other eight million Sanchezes in South Florida. I had somebody else in mind. Anyway, maybe Rick Sanchez would like to be because his TV shows obviously a bomb or a bomb, but a bomb. It's going to be going off here one of these days soon. You know, he'd like to be on the morning show. Have you been trying to watch it for just, you know, that was great. Oh, God. There's no audience. There's no studio audience to understand. It's just right. Him and attorney little broom closet talking to people on folding chairs. And you didn't like it. Oh, oh, I loved it. No, okay. What's long as you like it? Anyway, here's our first poll today. Now, yesterday, I don't know how much response this one won't be up really all that long. Because it's one of those, you don't want to like waste two hours on. I got another one later on. What's your take on the lake worth woman who got four years in prison for serving booze to miners and having sex with a 30 year old boy? What's up? They're already. Five choices. See, I don't know what to say about that. I just don't think that, especially when you consider that some other people like murder people, get like a slap on a wrist in a few years, then to get out early for good behavior and not raping any inmates. I mean, I don't know. Here are the choices. Four years is way too much. I agree with the sentence. She should have gotten more. She should only be on probation or she got four years. My collection should get 40. That's not your main to the question, but never less. If anybody missed it, your main says, oh, yeah, to police abuse Michael and they beat him up in a, he's got bruises and he's got a sore shoulder and he's all sore about it and he's got a sore, uh, back them, all these other things. They gave me a monkey, Boba, Maru. Yeah. And then, in the meantime, course, everybody saw that he was just a waltz at a long, just fine. He was moonwalking right into the goddamn jail and he moonwalked right out and hopped in the old van and zipped off to a Vegas. New game. I've been the zipping it on zipping it all these other things, but oh no, now we got a new spin on at the, of course, nobody. Oh, nobody believes that. Try even terrain, don't believe that. But it sounds good. They abused him and they beat up on him. To which if that were true, we'd probably say, Oh, right. They gave me a wedgie. Yeah. Uh-oh. Man, oh man, it's hard to find any room left over in here. I come. Good deal, birds. So the first pole is up and I don't know if, you know, I also should have, dammit, one more archaegory, I'm sorry about this, Eric. Right? We had to put a category in there. I don't know, I don't know the story. Oh, all right. Boy, got to put that on the idea. Yeah, I got a side up. Not for making it with a story. Let's get that on there. Tell Eric, uh, give him a nudge. Just poking the, uh, puppet. I'm counting. 7, and it's 10, and 5, 60, W, Q. I'm happy Friday, too. We got a full duck it today, and I didn't get to the memo yet about that morning talent that we were looking forward to. I'm listening. Officials Q, A, M, M, M might be. It says, morning showing out, sir. That's a good thing. So if somebody evidently from over here in his squeezes, could last me bag all morning long and all paranoid, of course it's not paranoid when he have good reason to be fearful, Howard. Oh, I mean, does he Howard. Attent in horse racing fans, Pompano Park is the open along with a card room for their 40th anniversary season.

It was kind of like a, um, oh, what the hell was it? Like a hoes. Oh, hi. Now. Now. Now. Take. Now. Take. Now. Let's come back to me. You should be able to. You're getting close. Pompano Park, horse power, you can bet off of the new racing schedule 9-5-4-9-7-2-2000 or go to the wicked web at pompanopark.com. My, my, and the vehicle. We are sports radio 5-60s, you and you, A-M. No. How young is too young? I don't know. But, good, man. I got you, you're not good. I am the winner. Well, it wasn't even close. I terminated for all great day, Chris. You're people didn't seem to care. I grabbed the movie and the little miss. California has spoken out to winner. Lots of women said I filed them in all it was like 33. But that don't care. And the water's okay. Because now I'm done to prop a data on the California team. Well, I used dollar my muscle and I used dollar my sex appeal. I'm very hot. I guess the borders didn't care that I may all those big mouth, who chees could screw you. Well, if you're honest with your public, and you tell them you're adding badminton to the free. Trust me. Therefore give you, like they did me and the link you told the GOP. He's a key change in the song. Who's the man taking the fat man to a Mario brother? Never had a prayer. Oh, probably, but, terrible. The boy to start about his naked, he still had men on the way. With a little teeny tiny holes. On the big, I'm the winner and my hot wife is a cannot be. And now I'm done to prop a data on the California team. Yeah, good for you. That's 17 at 560. By the way, that investigation about that, he's going to investigate himself. Ain't going to happen. No? He said, well, but I investigate myself. And that kind of stupid I lied. Let us see you on Tito. What's your take on the lake worth woman who got four years in prison for serving boost the miners having sex with that 13 year old boy? What's your take? If she got four years, Michael Jackson should get 40, 20 people said that. Are the first 63 votes? Four years is way too much, 14. That's what I voted. Do you owe for that? I voted for the probation. Tisha only beyond probation, 10. I agree with the sentence eight, she should have gotten more, four. And I'm not familiar with a story four so far. She got more, you look about 50 years in a slamer I would think at the very least. Here's a couple of facts as people get in pretty pressed about certain things. This one just very simply says US age, July 4th 1776 to October 7th 2003, RIP. How do you like that? And Greg and Sunrise is just so out of control. I wish he'd put it back in his pants just to kind of like, cool off for a second or two to heal. Says, how about a pool of nasty if I were present, I would blank. For me, I eliminate all taxes and options to all religions. Like I said, nice going Greg. I don't need a long assumptions from money's used directly to wait the poor elderly in the disabled. Oh, that's no fun. After all the other money they make is used to support the religious beliefs and build big fancy churches and temples. I would rate segue into the story of the day. You know what the story of the day is? What's the story of the day? The Reverend Robert Schur, and the crystal cathedral in that hour of shower power. But before we get to that, what we're going to take the call online. Number one, QAM hello. Hello, Neil. Yes sir. Yeah, one more for your poll. I know you're not taking poll things, but where was she when I was 13? Okay. Yeah, I was thinking about that. Yeah, we might be in poor taste. Oh, that's a bad way to put it. I always put my foot in my mouth. Anyway, let's not overburden, Eric. Okay, he's under tremendous duration. Unbelievable stress. Can you imagine a fat person like him at the holidays? Oh boy. I don't have to imagine. They're all little and man. Because holidays are just a convenient excuse to be really pigmented. Most of us fat people, we don't need any excuses. We just pick out just as matter of course, but during the holidays, I got some very bad news for you by the way. Guess what I found yesterday, and I wasn't even looking for it. Candy? Well, now you're warm. It was a kind of candy. I used to have my name on it. Rogers, almond, brinnell. Oh boy. ought to be illegal. Oh, gee. If I just wouldn't have seen it. I wasn't looking for trouble. It was my own business. I was just going to get like a bottle of water. And that's the truth. Available only with a prescription for people. Available only where I happen to like fall into. Oh, brother. That stuff is your right. It's a seemingly good. You can order it online. I don't see red there on the market numbers. Do I? That's bad. Oh, see that's bad. Anyway, here's a memo QAM position of the house. A. M. position available. December 11, 2003. That's yesterday's date. If I'm correct. Position morning show an answer. Availability in immediate. Absolutely. Description. Knowledge of sports and the ability to meditate is a must. Must also be highly motivated. Creative and a team player. Oh, oh, maybe that's why we're looking for a morning show an answer. Because maybe we got somebody who's not a team player. Absolutely. Frozen gate until fuel. Peace and resume. To QMA. Attention. Attention. Josh. Joshua. Oh, Joshua. That's a really Joshua. I'm guiding light. Joshua. I mean, Joshua in a Bible is Joshua. Do you know anybody named Joshua? I do now. Who did Joshua slay? He slayed some all of them. The keen and I. The Palestinians. The men and nights. He gentrified his real life. The Palestinians. The. Falacious. I don't know. He slayed a whole bunch of folks who's got to pull them. That's a lot of pain. Oh, listen to this. Here's the story of the century. I love this. Heftner burger ads upset Reverend Schuler. Rhyme. Oh. Woo. What a great time to Greg Spanx from sunrise. By the way, Greg, you can still put it away for a while. Los Angeles, the Reverend Robert H. Schuler, who's wittly our power televentilist show Ayers nationwide, is objecting to TV commercials that used playboy founder Hugh Heftner talk a new line of hamburgers. The ads are for line of five sandwiches called the six dollar burger sold by Carl's Junior restaurants in 14 Western states. A Carl's Junior, that's not where they had to eat coal. I burgers was it that was the other one. Or maybe it was Carl's Junior. What's the other rich thing out there? The big boy. The big boy. No, not big boy. They don't got no big boy. Jack or box. Jack and a box. I think you're very good. What a great comeback. That was after just sticking both feet in his mouth. That was good. The ads feature Heftner 77 and a signature silk pajamas holding a bulging sandwich. Oh. People always ask me, hey Heft, you have favorites. He says in one version, I love them all. It just depends on what I'm in the mood for. In one add, his comments are in the spruce with appearances by three women. One of whom says, I feel for Heft. It's so hard to choose. The tagline of the campaign is because some guys don't like the same thing night after night. In his weekly sermon, table I Sunday for broadcast this Sunday, the 77 year old Schueler denounces the ads as harmful to children and demeaning to women. Wait to hear his comments. He says, I have never been so appalled. Heard wounded embarrassed and I cannot let it pass. Schueler said from the pulpit. American kids are dying in Iraq every goddamn day, including Moriester Day. But he's concerned about commercials for Hamburg. Heard that Carl's Junior with Hugh Heftner. I have never been so appalled. Heard wounded embarrassed and I cannot let it pass. Schueler said from the pulpit. The ads as sparked hundreds of complaints since they began hearing in early November, Quintacarral Junior spokeswoman Caroline Leacon. She's Leacon. Last month, injections from the leaders of Thomas Aquinas College, a liberal, a Catholic liberal arts school college in Santa Paula, California, resulted in the resignation of Andrew Puzder. President and Chief Executive of CKE restaurants ink from the school's good board of governors. He's a Puts. Schueler said the company's founder Carl Karcher is just heartbroken that a company he founded on Christian principles has taken such an immoral act that can be so dangerous on the impressions of what the children who watch. Leacon says he hasn't heard from Karcher about the campaign. Where sorry people took offense, but were standing by our advertising, she said, unlike those whips that have a crowbee in bitch. Where sorry people took offense, but were standing by our advertising, she said, there's nothing sexual about them. Leacon said the Hector campaign will end at the end of the month. The change, Agi, and the spark complaints for years including one, where young woman rides a mechanical bullmaid eating a burger. Another word team of people manipulated chicken and church of its nuggets. That's what's grand was doing the thru! Yeah, he was searching for his nuggets. The end with the towel, by the way, the good news is to restrain for it is to deal with this. The end with the tagline chickens don't have nuggets, with the restaurants chicken strips. CKE restaurants based in Carpentier, California, or I never heard of that place, but I sure like the name Carpentier. Don't you like that? That does roll off nice. Carpentier, California, also operates hearty's and lost salsa restaurants. It's Specy and Spicy Baby City, and the Reverend Schiller is pissed off and fired up, so you those who are more on, they're going to be watching his hour of power, but let's go take a shower this Sunday morning on TV from his crystal-to-federal from his expensive pigs there in his crystal-to-federal. You'll be able to see him vent and from it the mouth. He has never been, what's that line again? I've never been so appalled hurt wounded and embarrassed, and I cannot let it pass. Sure we're said from the pulpit. He cannot let a big one pass. Wow, that just doesn't that just do something for you? No. Next we want a barf. Oh, it will. Besides that. Anyway, how's that thing with that, maybe I shouldn't even take a pole on this story, but I think it's important. It just struck me as really being bizarre, especially the way we distribute justice so unevenly. Yeah? I mean, what she did was obviously unacceptable, and in addition to what there's nothing in the story that I read that indicates that she gave the kid, like Michael, who was given in that Jesus juice, written it through a lot of her can with a straw. Yeah, that's in today's story again in the inquire. We knew about it in the Vegas story, but now come to find out the kid with a cancer. Okay, that's a man, the centerpiece of this new allegation. He was feeding him Jesus juice, which is what he called when you drink wine out of a can through a straw. It's Jesus juice. But I mean, there's no education that she had to look at a kid up, but of course, she was 27, he's 13. So don't say it. No, what you have to plan with wine. Anyway, what's your take on a lake worth woman who got four years in prison for serving booze to miners and having sex with a 13 year old boy? I know what Reverend Schoenor would think about it. If she got four years Michael Jackson City at 40, 33 people said that. She should only be on probation. Guess how many said that? I'm 30 man. Four years is way too much, 17. I agree with the sentence 13. I'm not permitted with a story 10. She should have gotten more six, six angry suffer of an idiot. Just in time for the holidays, you should have gotten the life honey. They should have fried you ass in the electric chair and old spurkey. Fire an head baby up again, just one more time. What you think? Oh yeah, definitely. 10 26 and 5 60 WM. It's a wonderful time of the year. And the holidays. A lot of people enjoy it. They do their thing with their families and their friends. But a lot of people hate to crowded malls in the traffic and a lot of register lines and all the parking hassles. In fact, some people go to get so pissed off about a parking space or you know how that goes. So make your gift giving a pleasure. A little easier this year for you and your loved ones.

Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story. In one song he mentions banging seven women. He was Lou Bega. I'm not a guy. I'm not a guy. I'm not a guy. I'm not a guy. I don't want to brag but the Lou Bega is cavalier about his mega hit. Mom, number five. I'm unlike me so many epic nights. I must snack often. God is this guy for real. Desperate to get a viewpoint was conflicted with this obnoxious mother. We start outside counter stock or Jane. Oh man suck. This Lou Bega is a despotional sex addict. He has the lesions of rander and a severe fallocum session. He should be castrated and forced to eat it. I mean really. You don't catch me having sex with seven men. Ever. In my life time. But we are attempted to spread it Lou Bega had backfire. So we went the other way and found porn star Ron Jeremy. Jesus that's f***ing fantastic. You know I don't think I ever did it with seven women in my whole career. I mean at one time four was the most they gave me. But then it kind of evens out because I was you know. Let's just say I'd that Lou Bega didn't put it in all the places I did. So for me four women was more like ten or twelve. You know come to think of it. That Lou Bega is an asshole. Who was he to say he's better than me? Were you listen to this typical man. They all have to whip out their things and brag about who gets to do me. I mean not me. Oh hell yes I mean me. Do me Lou. Of course my lovely for that is what I do. I sort of a still lovely ladies. Oh Christ we're back to him again. Well somebody please kill me. It's a big juicy shopping with like a show business tonight. On the inside of a hide. Henry 3. Yeah I don't get on here we're here to oblige 142 volts on there. And the audience don't agree with that sentence ridiculous. That's why I put it on there. Coach to show you man this judge. What was the judge? What more? The judge was somebody. Where the hell is that? I know was in here. Jack Cook. Palm Beach Circuit Judge Jack Cook. Follow me one reason to give Dwayne a lighter sentence that she was the guidelines called for a sense of eight to sixteen and a half years in prison. Gads. Eight to sixteen and a half years. But he said the psychologist has to fight. She's ever so made a pen of personality disorder and wanted to be like by the neighborhood teams. Well what better way to be like by the neighborhood team. I give a bunch of boos and screw at least one of them. That she was really popular right. He liked it. So wouldn't. Anyway this fact he just sent me from Philly Bay allegedly in Rio de Janeiro Brazil do you believe that? No. No. Because the handwriting was too familiar. But it says do you think anything will happen now that they find out that Halle Burton is over charging the pen of gun on a November contract. Yeah stick Cheney's going to go away on this weekend. Spend a whole weekend killing peasants again. Right. And if anybody has to go out and he'll give give them the bird. Somebody call that story. It's coming just relax. Okay. Everybody has come down. A little bit too pushy. Okay. I got a big pile of stuff including this. The brand new and choir. Oh. The December 23rd edition. There's only the 12th. I was so excited when I saw the new and choir on the shelf. I just about pee my pants. Then I saw those Rogers candies. Those almond burles. That was bad. Can't see nothing is perfect. Speaking of nothing is perfect. That's what your president would tell you because three suicide bombers in a furniture truck blew themselves up at the gates of US Army Base yesterday killing one soldier in owning 14. It was the 3rd suicide attack on American troops in Iraq this week. There was another soldier that drowned yesterday which should have the story. I had it. But if he didn't look real quick, it wasn't important to put on the news. I guess. That's how sad this is. This is just like Vietnam all over again. Not in terms of the numbers yet, but in terms of the way the media is dealing with like, well, that's not so important anymore. Americans getting killed in Iraq. Well, that's commonplace. It happens every day. So let's have some more flu stories on there to keep the public in a state of panic. And psychosis. Oh my God. Right. Oh my gosh. There's this flu going around and people are lined up 50 yards deep for that flu shot. And a few kids. They put this statistics on there. There's thousands of people die from the flu every year. Is this something new? No. Is it revolutionary? No. Is it the end of the world? No. No. Let's just keep them occupied and pee in their pants. Now let's not talk anymore about dead soldiers because it's not good for the bush mice's reelection. Pentagon auditor is found that Vice President Dick Cheney's former company may have overturned the Army by as much as $61 million for gasoline in Iraq. See me defensive. Officials say yesterday. Halle Burton apparently didn't profit from the possible over charges. Officials said speaking on condition of enemy. Of course, the problem the officials said was that Halle Burton may have paid a subcontractor much for the gas in the first place. The Pentagon official said the Halle Burton subsidiary involved in the Iraq construction work Kellogg Brown and Ruth. Also submitted a proposal for cafeteria services that was $67 million to high. Officials said the Pentagon rejected the proposal. The defensive official said they had no reason to believe problems for anything other than stupid mistakes by Halle Burton. Well, that sounds like all of our work. There's a bunch of no big contracts. They make stupid mistakes. With your tax dollars. And the meantime we're saying, Hey, guess what? Are you countries that didn't join in with us? Germany and France and Canada and everybody else? All or Canada and I were saying, Oh, we still like you. But maybe we'll give you like a little bone. But we do want you to forgive all those loans to the Iraqis. You know, I help us out. But in the meantime, we're going to stick our foot way up your ass. But they help us out because otherwise it'll be cost us more money. To try to bail their ass out. To try to extricate ourselves from this quagmire. I'm going to read that story that article later by David Corn. But when I was starting to read you about the hordes, about the stir in the Hornets and this because you I used that term before. It's an old concrete phrase. David Corn was in the end of the nation. I'm going to read that later. I got a lot of reading to do. They in between the very important calls of course. A lot of important calls. Here's the second poll. We're going to be starting at 11 o'clock. Not noon, Eric 11 o'clock. Because this one I just wanted to see the lay of the land. We got the message. You know what I mean? Got it. Second poll today. Which show biz figure gives you the biggest pain in the ass. We've never asked you quite that way. No, not that. What show business figure gives you the biggest pain in the ass. I got a short list. Dear Liz Taylor, Michael Jackson, the cold kidman, Ben Affleck and Robert Downey Jr. Can't put him up. I'm so sorry. I'm tired of day low. Yeah, well, while we get them all on just relax. Because I don't be pushy. Here on the inquiry. And to brand new one, Nicole's engagement disaster. The cheating scandal and why fiancee's friends Hayter. Man, Hayter is an understatement. She just makes me gag. She got an Italian. No, not really. She's okay. I'm not gonna, you know, she's not okay, actress once in a while, right? Generic. Yeah, it's very generic. Oh, I was trying to watch sexy beast last night. Did you ever see it? No. I just, another slow starter. I just couldn't get into it. Then I kept flipping back over to the hockey game. And I just, I'll watch it another time. I'll wait for your review. It looks like it's got possibilities, but it's, I don't know. I just, little bizarre. Little too strange for a normal guy like me. I can't get past that title. You say, I've got the worst news in the history of mankind. This is even, in fact, the story by Reverend Schuiller, I take it back. This is the story of the day. You step yourself in? All right, it's wrapped on. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said yesterday he's leaning toward another independent run for the presidency, and will make his decision public in January. Was I right? Yeah, that's bad. Really bad. We're testing the waters, Nader said an interview with CNN and it's a high probability, but that's yet to be determined. You miserable, egotistical arrogance, son of a bitch. That's what I have to say to you Ralph Nader and anybody it would vote for him. Didn't we learn our lesson the first time? No. He didn't. Nader has formed an exploratory committee for a 2000 for a one city would gauge his support to the success of fundraising efforts, and the number of volunteers who come forward. I think it'll be a lot. God, good man. The consumer advocate last made a bid for the mama. We know that he won about 3% of the popular vote. In some fact, some Democrats blamed Nader, 69 for seconding off votes that might have gone to democratic candidate, Al Gore, especially in Florida, where Nader took 97,000 votes. Those crooks say they won by 527 votes. He had 97,000 votes. Clearly the overwhelming majority which would have won a go on to Gore. Meanwhile, what is responses to that? Gore beat Gore, Nader says. He didn't get to see his home state. That would have made him present. He blundered in Florida. I didn't ask for state by recount. Right. It was Gore's fault. Not the Supreme Court. Not James Baker the TUR. No. Not those chat. Tony agitators, they shipped in from outside, pounding on the courthouse during the county. But I said, but I said, wasn't that. It was Al Gore's fault. And Lee, but I didn't mention that. That would be a bad taste. Right. I would say the Democratic voters are following. If you think that a third party candidate is going to take votes away in cost of Democrats' election, you've got the power entirely within your own franchise, but you go to the voting and vote for the Democrats. He's anyone I would say? What would you say? All right. That's exactly what I'm going to do. My life and love. This is the first one to end this right. You and I. The fourth afternoon. The fourth and you. You and I. I know that the Lord even loves Neorodgers. Have it up the election officials left you, confused? Here is your guy to understand. How to cast your vote. In all beach county, Florida. Follow along with me to see just how easy it can be. Let's get started. Shall we? Joining me here in the booth is Mr. Murmell's D. Who are you voting for? I'll leave me. You, I see. Now, leave the butterfly baller. Starting with Bush K.D. in the left column. You, Cadden, Chickal, Grower, Mangala, Ikemen and Gervils in the right. Where's our leave of over there? This guy, Bullsky. Yes. Is this guy who makes my baby food? No. Now, simply, punch a hole in the 1959 Univac key punch card. Okay. Wait. Over there. Here. Use this microscope. All right. Oh, there. Is that it? Okay. Oh, no. That invalidates your vote. All right. Yeah. Punch it again. You do that again. I'll punch you. Who else would put magic? Why do you cheat? Not a ring old heave. Remember, comrades, if you want to live in Florida. Exercise your right to vote in accordance to the little brother. 1045 at 560 anyway. While a little footnote on that eight or six, his data was in Prince and yesterday for a strategy session with Green Party activist to consider the pros and cons of another race. He said his decision will be too full. Whether to run for the presidency at all and whether to run again on a Green Party ticket. Meanwhile, the party is divided on another eight or can of the sea. That's a good news. Green Party member Larry Barnett former mayor of Sonoma, California. Now, member of its city council said the party's priorities should be defeating George W. Bush. Absolutely correct. Any diversion from that even rooted in principle interferes with that goal. He said explaining why he's against another need to run. I would urge him to throw his weight behind. Whoever they democratic party puts up Barnett said. You go boy. See, said it across the show you. That some people will have learned or lessen. Let's all urge him. Let's be see. Let's see. Mad says. Will the Democrats allow heterosexual men to marry each other, so they can not have children go girls, for instance. Hmm... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Heanne receives this. He knows how to fix this.

I agree with a sentence 27. I'm not permitted with a story 27. She should have gotten more only 14. So Judge Cook, well you see I guess you know he figured he was being lenient.

Well, you guys are really doing it. Lacy was smothered. Front page story on the inquiry. I've avoided talking about this. And I promise you I'll never talk about it again until tragic mom to be Lacy Peterson died while she slept in her bed smothered in death with a pillow held over a face by her husband's sky. Then after driving to a warehouse where he had hidden his boat he removed Lacy's pajamas and read restaurant and tan maternity pants he'd been wearing earlier in the evening. Finally, the 31 year old fertilizer salesman. Pulltweller drawstring at the waist of the pants and strapped her thighs together with duct tape. All they tried to do left to screw in all the time. And an apparent effort to ensure that Lacy's baby would not be born before he dumped your body in San Francisco Bay. That's the shocking never before disclosed scenario of Lacy's death, presented by detectives to prosecutors and reveal prior to the very first time exclusively by this which in Quarre. This sensational information obtained from insiders close to the case will be used by prosecutors to try to answer the question mark has been asking for a year. How did Lacy die? Have anybody asked that for a year? At least. What's more? The inquarre has learned that police have seized chilling physical evidence from Peterson's bedroom, supporting their contention the cold blood of killer smothered Lacy after she'd gone to bed. Detectives also discovered a telltale pillow case was missing from the couple's bedding, possibly disposed of by the killer after becoming stained in the struggle, according to a source post to the case. Investigators became so sure of their horrifying murder scenario that we speak before. Lacy's body was discovered this past April a former family that all the evidence pointed her being killed in her sleep revealed the source. Police believe that when Scott Lacy got home December 23rd they had a fight. It was physical enough for Scott to suffer cuts and Lacy to throw up the source post to the inquarre. As reported exclusively to the last March traces of vomit and specks of blood matching Lacy's were found and I kitchen mop. Everyone said the couple had a physical fight and that Scott had mopped up the floor clean. After the confrontation police believed Lacy got on dress went to bed, not knowing that men's later her young life would be cruelly snuffed out to the close source. Imagine that beautiful young woman eight months pregnant terribly upset by the fight yet, finally it rushed to sleep and probably dreaming of the baby wore she'd soon hold in her arms. Then suddenly she's awake and fighting a losing battle for her life. The sea ravage body of Lacy and her unborn son Connor washed up and San Francisco Bay nearly four months after the pretty 2070-old vanished from her home in Medesau, California, Christmassy 2002. But the killer was unable to cover all his tracks revealed the close source when police got a search warrant for Scott and Lacy's house on February 18. It took away a lot of things from the master bedroom including a white couperter blanket fitted bottom sheet and top sheet even a ruffles and mattress cover. The detective's made a startling discovery of bloodstained that proved to be from Scott on the company on top of the bed to close the close source. And in a strange twist, a pillowcase was missing from one of the pillows in the master bedroom according to the close source, Investigators theorized that Scott got rid of it because it became stained or damaged as he held the pillow over Lacy's face. The detective also found Scott blood on a doorframe in the house and in his truck corner of the source, Incredibly only ours after his wife's disappearance along before was declared a homicide, Scott seemed to go to great pains to establish an alibi for the spilled blood the inquire was learned, As police searched the house for clues on Christmas Eve, the flandering husband struck up a conversation with Lacy's mother, With her mother's best friend, Sadie Rickard, and made a bizarre statement according to the close source, Sadie told police that out of the blue Scott said to where if they find blood anywhere that doesn't mean a thing. I'll always say that to people. Then he added something about getting cut off cut off and because he was an outdoorsman said I could drop blood anywhere. Sad's like O.J., all over again. Yeah. He just bleeds all the time. He's an outdoorsman. Robert, he drank water from a creek too. So if you find blood anywhere, it's, it ain't no fun. Sadie thought it was very strange that Scott would even be bringing up the subject of the moment when everybody else was thinking of nothing else but finding Lacy. The dead woman's 22-year-old sister Amy Rocha also helped detect his tight in the web around Scott during investigators' additional search for the house February 18. The pretty young hairdresser which had a wood Lacy while she cut her brother and all Scott's hair on December 23, was brought into see if she spotted anything unusual in a dresser in the master bedroom Amy found a black maternity blast like the one Lacy had warded the salon where she cut Scott's hair. Oddly was inside out as if somebody had pulled it off a Lacy and was scrunched up in a ball on top of other things in Lacy's underwear, a drawer revealed the source. Amy told detectives that Lacy would never put a dirty blast on top of her underwear. Then one of them found a grocery bag in a bedroom closet that contained blue pajamas that obviously had been worn. He was pretty smart, wasn't he? No. The police officers who originally searched that, and you know what, I'm thinking I'm not going to be the rest of it. It's written this week's inquired December 23. Mark Garagos, I'm just thinking this, I could be wrong, maybe it's wishful thinking on my part, but I have a feeling he's going to be old for two. So fair, Ray quiet, Linky all worked together and changed. But never crash, no but they might want to fill up, Ray I want her big butt, ow, ow, fuck him, ain't trials, no I can stay at home, and chase college tail judging from what I've seen, but choices are up seem. It's either why we leave her matter, help her and be, can I call her? I don't know, I can't get a license, but I'm taking on his chest. Please get the wits to run, so I can have some fun. Wow, me and Cha-Fuck-Wan, her and Washington, I'll hold out that T-shirt, contested my yard, and all they look, I'll look, or else they may hard, it'd be a dream come true, it'd be a major coup.

What's your take on the lake worth 1,000 to got 4 years in prison for serving booze to miners, and having sex with a 13 year old boy, 243 votes? If she got 4 years, Michael Jackson said he had 40. Of's a movie. 70 people said that, she said only beyond probation 57, I agree with the sentence 35, four years is way too much 33, I'm not permitted with a story 31, and she should have gotten more 17 hard-hearted bastards.

And it's going to have like a zillion names on it. But first. Victim held hostage at Neverland. Oh. I'm not going to read that part of it first. It does like a three part story. Okay. Singer bought passports for victims' families, say sources. The incredible reveal last week that according to sources, Michael Jackson offered his alleged molestation victim and his family a one-way trip to South America to get them out of the way. Now sources say that Jackson went so far as to get them all passports. Jackson made the offer back in March just after the Martin Vesier TV documentary aired, and the scandal was mushrooming over Michael's boy in his bedroom or her relations, said a source for the family. Do you think it's your main to the case? No. Michael offered the boy in his family and all expenses paid trip to South America, Brazil and Argentina were mentioned, but according to the boy's family it was a one-way ticket. Michael let the no the message was clear, don't come back. Michael offered to pay their air affairs accommodations on medical bills. He promised his support them for the rest of their lives. You'll love it down there, he told them. The family feels he wanted them out of the way to shut them up. He got them all passports, it was done fast, and he handed them over to the mother the boy his oldest sister and younger brother, they still have them. An insider disclosed police officials believe Jackson hired Beverly Hills private investigator Brad Miller to help to get the family of passports. The day that 70 officers served a search warrant at Jackson's Neverland residence, another warrant was being served at Miller's Beverly Hills office. Investigators seized videos, papers, and computer hard drives. There were also looking for information regarding the fanboys passports. And, Jack O'Skeam to stop boy and family from seeing his creepy TV show of say sources. I love the way the inquiry inquires, say sources like in Little Tiny Print. Yeah. Michael Jackson hit the Martin Bashir documentary from his life's molestation victim and his family by whisking them off on a private jet and making sure they were nowhere near a TV on the day at air its sources say. And what sources believe was an attempt to keep the then 13 year old boy in his family of the dark about the disturbing onscreen interplay between Jackson and the youngster, the singer sent him on a floor to vacation, Florida got it. Got it. The day before the BBC show aired on ABC's 2020 late, Alas. February. In the documentary the boy is shown holding hands with Jackson resting his head on the star shoulder and Jackson confirms that both the victim and his younger brother and eyewitness to the alleged molestation slept in his bedroom. I think Michael felt the family would be distressed to the point of seeking legal action so he devises his own blackouts of the source posted investigation. The day before the show aired Michael threw the family down to my name as private jet and put them up in a forced or hotel but cops believe he made sure a security teen kept them away from TV and newspapers. And to keep the victim as preoccupied as possible Michael had one of the boy's favorite actors accompanying him. Then thereafter David the victim and his family told police that rush hour coaster Chris Tucker and his wife joined the boy and his family on the flight. Oh Chris. Police believe Jackson's people asked Tucker to accompany them to my meet-up put their minds at ease. The boy actually first met Tucker back in 2000 while he was receiving chemotherapy and they were introduced by that comedy club owner Jamie Masada who runs a comedy camp for underprivileged kids. Boy he sure screwed his soul. Masada told the inquire the boy was in a hospital in too much pain even to eat. I told him he's got to eat to live what can I do for you in a whole world to make you wheat. And the boy said I'd like to see Chris Tucker in my room and I'd like to meet Adam Sandler and I'd like to go to Neverland to meet Michael Jackson. What no pony? Masada managed to make all three dreams come true for the boy who still can recover from cancer but reportedly needs a new kidney. Added Masada perhaps the only good thing to come out of this whole sorry message that a boy who was once given 14 to eat to live is still alive. And that's not even the meat of the story yet. We'll get to that. Really? Yeah, didn't there not a whole lot of new stuff? And they're like I said, Vic and held hostage in Neverland. We had that last week's story. But for anybody who missed it plus a little bit more, can never like stick it in there and twist it too much in the case of this son of a bitch pedophile piece of crap freak. Which obit figure gives you the biggest pain in the arse? Okay. We got some votes on there already and I'm sure they're waiting for their favorite right before they vote. 57 votes. Look at that. He got Sanders 12. Oh man. There is a God. Michael's action 12 rose. Yodana 12. J. Low eight. Ben Affleck five. Let's tailor three. Nicole Kidman appear. Robert Downey, Jr. He's got a small pair.

Out freaking standing. Why haven't one? The facts. I just said it to you. I just grabbed her right now. She's no movie star. I want to read not asking for movie stars. Showbiz figures. She certainly a showbiz. But yeah. Show no. He's no movie star. Only at the disgusting obnoxious bitch. Nancy Grace doesn't that bitch ever go home. No captain Richie never goes home.

I'll do the next one in the 10 o'clock hour will be the one to clock hours for my spots. God, who's that? Who's that? Who else cares? Anybody keep in track? Oh, just pass the money. Okay. All you spots is out there. Just send us the money. A QM that's her model. And if your spots don't get on too bad, we still want the money. I get him back to Michael. See, it's true. I'm awful little bit. I'll never recover from that. That was intentional. T. He. But George won't be there next week. I'll be here. He's never figured about the time he comes back. I'll forget. But guess what? By the time he comes back, I'll be gone. Here's one. This is good. Although I do like that movie. A beautiful mind. But this is. Oh, he's a good actor. Just a good actor. But he's a major asshole. Russell Crowe. The Crow man. Marty and Miami says Russell Crowe is an ass. I went up to one time and coca in a girl. Maybe six months ago. He asked for his autograph. He said I'm busy. And. And that doesn't go hand in hand, mate. Or something like that. I'm not the rude and what he wrote. I stood there in Oz. He walked away with the parent bodyguard, laughing and cracking jokes. He said you're a spartzer. I'm not reading the end word. Why? Why? I guess you don't like him. Marty, let's get Russell Crowe on there right away. Rosie O'Donnell has moved away into the lead. How do you like that with 19? She's. She's tipi-toed into lead. Can you see her tipi-toe? Oh God. No. She's got 19. If I can ask him, can you see an adult elephant tipi-toe and through the Chinese shop? I don't think so. Michael Jackson 18, the on-sadder 16, J. L. or 12. Everybody else in the single digits. Although Nancy Grace's got five. She'll move up there. But. Bitch. God. She just. I just see her and I get angry. I don't want something like an angry old man, but you know what? Sometimes when I see certain people, I feel like an angry old man. Anyway. Vickham held hostage at Neverland. Michael Jackson held his Les Malestation Victim in his family hostage at his Neverland Ranch. Exclamation point. A 50. Plus page after David to be unsealed in Jackson's January 9th agreement claims that the Cancer Strict and Boyne is worried mother weren't allowed to leave Neverland. Never. And the hostage situation culminated in the mom's dramatic late night plea to a sympathetic Jackson employee we need to get out of here followed by an escape. The mother's insisted to officials that she and her children were held hostage for several days in Neverland. Sometime after February's airing of Martin Bashir's documentary in which Jackson and the victim spoke about sharing the singer's bedroom according to a search post to the case. The family maintains they were held against their will. It was an odd situation to begin with. The mother staying at another house on the property and the victim and his brother sleeping in Michael's bedroom. When the mother grew suspicious of Michael's client destin activities with a role to son. Tensions came to a flashpoint. The affidavit states that the mother was especially distressed when she was called Michael had been serving wine and a soda can to her gravely ill son. In the affidavit the boy says Michael called the drink Jesus Jews said the close source. Yeah. Maybe they misunderstood. Maybe they're going to say Jesus are you on ads use again? Jesus Christ. The mother claims to the affidavit the family wasn't allowed to leave the property without an escort name where father closely by Neverland employees throughout the day while on the property. It's apparent that she believed it was a hostage situation. And it got to the poor were reached to crisis level. An insider disclosed after the mother was told by her son that Michael by giving him wine to drink she blew her stack. She had angry words with Michael. Ultimately, she decided the family needed to leave but the mother told investigators. Michael wouldn't let her leave. He told her in the children you cannot leave here. He may have been afraid they might say damaging things about him. According to the mother they were prisoners on Jackson's vast estate. Exclamation point. Doors were locked. And security was warned not to let them go. Finally, after Levin O'clock one night the panic mother approached and Everland House manager and said, we need to get out of here the close source reveals. The House manager agreed to help the mother and her children drop the 2700 acre range. The manager said he needed to speak to someone in his security detail first. If we turn to a few minutes later and struck the mother, get her children there along together quickly. As soon as this was done the manager loaded the family into a vehicle and drove the 100 miles to their home and L.A. himself. From the mother's claims in the afternoon you get the impression was similar to a prison break. Since the incident the House manager who helped the family flee the ranch as part of the ways with Michael Jackson never land chief. He's also, I can't imagine why. He's also been interviewed by investigators and his cooperating with them. If they could amass enough evidence it's possible police officials could charge Jackson other members of his organization with the legal detention. Another one saw to resuscitate with the investigation told the inquiry as part of the child molestation case against Jackson. They sent a barbaristic attorney will show that he waged in a labored campaign behind the scenes against the alleged victim and his family. They believe evidence will show that Jackson knew he was guilty and took action showing that guilt. He didn't even have to conduct investigation like Arnold. They believe he literally kept the family hostage and never land this will come back to automatically inside of it. It's really sad the boy and his family went in with love and came out with fury. Now here's even though this is the last paragraph of this story. It wasn't until about three and a half months ago that the boy was interviewed by police and told him his whole story. And some of those talking heads on there a couple of nights ago trying to say, Well you know the LAPD was involved in that first investigation in February with the children's whatever that children's agency California was and they were not coming to find out. They just made that up. So there you go. There's the latest on Michael Michael motorcycle. 560 pound 560 on a 1810 Verizon Marvel slime which hope is figure gives you the biggest pain in the ass. We also got the latest on your friend Rush the pill pop in one my buddy your close personal pie. On WQAM. Hi Neil how are you? I'm doing good. Well my my little two-cent years for someone who I used to love and adore but who has since become such a a Relid well he's always been a religious not but no Gibson is not to be the biggest pain in the ass. Yeah. This whole Jesus movie that he did. I mean that's that's enough. That's taken it just a little too far. And and you'll be this major knowing in fact I have this story here somewhere way down in my pile which I was hoping not to get to it. That they've Vatican that there are three three different groups in the side of Vatican who saw the movie and they just loved it. Of course they did it when they know about their you know their whole enchilada there. Right. Let me tell you something about Miss Nancy Grace. Tell me something about that bitch. I was watching during the death Friedman trial because it happened to be friends with death and I knew of course of Renaissance I knew the whole story. When I was watching her and she was so smug and so. You know demeaning she when that whole thinking that we're that was supposedly in the hot tub with the boy at night. One o'clock in the morning. Miss Nancy Grace in that bitchy southern draw says and a quote. I bet it wasn't. The analyst and she was given him a not hot tub. Right. Can you. Can you. Can you. Hey man. Hey man.

I sure it's going to go a ton of the thing today. But when you'll see today. Yeah. Just like that. Mel Gibson just got three thumbs up for his controversial movie. The passion of the Christ from a Trinity of Parval groups in the Vatican. His producer showed it to the Secretary of State. The Pontifical Council for Social Communications and a congregation for the doctrine of the Faith last weekend. It was a religious experience. It says America's Zeenah.org which covers the Pope. Asked one of the moviegoers. Theologian priest Augustine De Noya about reports that the flick is anti-Semitic. Let me answer you. Plainley. He said there's absolutely nothing anti-Semitic. Rantide Jewish about Mel Gibson's film. On Tuesday, Andy DeFirmation League had Abraham Fossman told Hollywood Reporter, I don't know if the Vatican is the best to judge and how it's going to impact the Jews. Oh, they don't master of understanding what that he is. Mel Gibson, another religious freak man, and she said, when in doubt, toss him out. Ascle. Michael Jackson, 27, which Joe Biz figure gives you the biggest pain in the ass. Now you know what's how he went up on those reading that story. Right. 27 for Michael, Rosie O'Donnell, 25.

What is this mean? Do I am I supposed to know what this means? I don't know. I just got the Justin from it. Okay. Let's see. Use another one says, oh yeah, he's a big enough celebrity. This is a good one. I like it a lot. Bill Mar, M.A.H.E.R. He's me a huge pain in the ass. I can't stand his smug on funny persona. He fancies himself some kind of king political satirist, but everything I've ever heard come out of his mouth is a economic garbage, a so called libertarian who voted for Naderwin 2000, and is they called anculture a Kindred spirit. I can't stand him. I might change my hope. Bill Mar. When you ride with alone, you ride with a sauna. Oh, brother. Get rid of him. And his post personal buddy with a suspenders. Uh huh. That one too.

Keep changing. All the proceeds from our stuff go to a band and pair rescue. noon to two today. And now I want to give a big sendoff because hopefully it'll raise more than 20 bucks. Which they generally do. They're usually good for about 20. Oh, baby, they'll be good for... God turn them! Jim, who continues getting a little bit too verbose on his facts. He's got about 40 words on here. That's the usual too. Jack Deckleson says, just an annoying thing. Now we'll put him on there just to humor. You want to think he's gonna get many votes. No, that would be that field. No, well, well, well I've been getting any field. What's annoying about him? I do, I will confess when I see him at the laker games, when I always have to show him there. I just... I don't know, it just bugs me. But... I like Jack Newell's in a line. Yeah. But then also Jim says, well, I certainly like to have his exes or anybody on his anybody that he's banging and my jealous or what the answer Jim is. Very jealous. Now this fact you sent me this is a barn burner man. Yeah. This goes on nearly forever and unfortunately for us in Iraqis and I hope he's listening on the internet right now. The part about Bush is so sad. It's just, oh, makes my him or its quiver. He says on a recent trip to Fort Laudernale, you show us recommended me by several acquaintances since I was a visitor to the area I live in Denver. I took a chance to took the recommendations from the locals without reservations. I don't know whether or not it's a good thing, but it took just a few minutes of listening for me to get hooked. Unfortunately, I'm not able to listen to you show us often by the internet as I'd like to, but I try to listen whenever possible. Hopefully you're listening to the day, Russ. Whenever I do listen to know it's always a delayed recorded broadcast from either the same day or the day before, that's not right. What does he mean by that? I don't know. It's not a delayed recorded broadcast, Jim. The recorded shows aren't you able to listen to, but I'm never for the chance to participate in any polls or voice by opinion on a current topic. Why would that be? He must have a well. Your views on most issues are strongly agreed with, however, there are those issues which we don't agree on. As a matter of fact, we are at extreme opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to Bush. And the ways in part of this is he's talking about President Bush, not what you might think. Although he may indeed not be the brightest most qualified, most experienced, most popular, even the best-looking candidate to ever assume the role as president. You are missing the single most tangible asset of his being an office. With Bush an office, the candidate favored of the people, such as Hillary the Ruggler King Lesbian, Oprah the open orifice talk show host, Barbara the bitstryson and Jesse the racist Jackson sitting it out. I realize it's not much of a consolation prize, but stripping away some of the powers of these other more dangerous people seems like a pretty good trade-off in the long run. Right, all of those lives that were losing over dinner, I rang all the friends around the world I were losing, the fact that the world hates America like Poison, now more than maybe ever before. That's well worth an addition of which I didn't realize that Hillary was on a ballot in 2000. I didn't realize that Oprah was on a ballot or Barbara Streisand, or even Jesse Jackson. And it was a world that would have done the same thing attack and I rack. Right. So I mean you talk about really reaching desperately to try to rationalize the fact that we've got this moron sitting in a White House right now, who stole the election, right in broad daylight. But anyway, he goes on to say, I apologize for bringing up the past, but Montreal candidate doesn't have the other of this people in a single city, and now he's getting right. I think he's got a good point. London England gets those honors, so I think you are- That's the only good looking people in all of London our visitors. If you have any doubt, take a good look at the Royal Family. If this is the best this country has to offer them, think about how ugly they're really ugly once. Trust me what I tell you Russ that scene plenty of men answered him, and oh man, they make the people in Montreal look like confession models. It says, how my golden retriever's got better bloodlines than that family. She has a straiter and wider teeth than any of them. I've actually seen alligators with better looking teeth at most Brits, so Neil, they're listeners who it sounds like many have never made outside the confines of their trailer parks and their rowhouses. There is life outside of Florida. It may be ugly life like London Montreal, but there is life. Also those assholes who call up and interrogate you on a year, kind of remind them they're several rapid other low-life radio stations out there for their kind. If the issues you deal with are too complicated for them to understand, they can always pack their trailers and go to Montreal, Canada, then not only will Montreal have the grotesque ugly people, I have stupid people as well. I enjoy your show. Russ and Iraq uses very verbose, but they long, amazing all over the place facts. Thank you Russ, kill some good time. Sure, what up? How's that pool coming? We've got a whole lot more names to add, just be patient, got a long way to go. Although just like the last two days, man, this thing is just zip and write along, you know? Showed up. Don't ask me why. We're done. We're rolling it. Anyway, 150 free votes on our second pool, which hope is this figure gives you the biggest pain in the ass? Michael Jackson 36, Rosio Donald has got... Fuck, turn the man! On Sanders 23, you know, I went... and thanks for reminding me that Josh too, because I would have not remembered. But when I mentioned that, I thought, well, they're gonna get like three or four, you know? 23, so I'm not the only one who finds him just obnoxious and disgusting, and one of the ugliest stereotypes. Every black person in America should demand that he be off the remaining leave not sooner. Drive as peace of crap. J.08, T.N.N.C. Grace 11, double digits for N.T. Let's hear it. Bitch.

I got that big story coming up in the next hour. Rush Limbaugh. Is he qualified for the pole? Yeah. That's just sweet acid. This is called votes already. Are we all ready on it? Yeah. We're working to help him move it up there fast. He just like yesterday. We got to give him a handy grant. He's got several. No. Yeah. Your aunt is going to have lots of handy crab. Pretty soon. That's why he lost all of that weight. When you start popping him. And of course you can't hear a guy damn thing. You can't even hear the splash it makes you want to hit the bull. But my mom said she'll volunteer to come to the house to listen to the door. She's just jealous. Edn for Lauderdale said Dennis Miller has to be the biggest tent in the ass. We just got him on her. Thank you, Ed. Now what are we going to do about this guy who wants to donate the dolphin tickets? Oh, I don't know. Explain to him that we don't do that. We don't. I don't know. We just don't have time. It's for the ego game on Monday night. Right. That's a big deal. And he wants to donate the two really great seats to the dolphin equal game in a stadium on Monday for Band of Pairscu for us to auction off on a year. We appreciate it. But it's a big nightmare. Payed in the ass. Okay. Thanks, anyway. Dennis. We appreciate it. I'm not saying that. I'm thinking about. And we're going to do a couple of days. That's right. Give him the 70 for the holidays, and then they can go watch the Eagles Christ it all for some Monday. Now this will pacify Bill at road before Haka Ma wasn't talking about Jean Critsch in. But probably mainly Bill because even while I'm sitting in Toronto, we don't do a Canadian talk Showay. Although, in case Casper Nova's listening, I'm sure he is taking notes. Whether today it's minus two, it's sunny in the 20 a little murky actually. That was sunny earlier. Little murky in 20. It could be. We always going to be today for a high. Yeah. 20 a tomorrow. Sunday. It's going to be. And Monday. Sunday. So at least we're consistent. Not bad. For just 10 a.m. It was a little snow on the ground this morning. But it's all gone. It's all gone. Damn it. How can you get in the spirit of Chris, Miss Nginuke and these things are new years with that little snow on the ground? Yeah. Like we get here for. And yeah. Right. That's why nobody wants to be there. This time of the year unless they absolutely have to be. I mean, they want to be. So let's go to the day. No. I just want to see. That's a lot of snow on the ground like water town Buffalo places like that. Candidate and other scooters from Iraq business. This will make Bill happier. U.S. president George W. Bush's grateful for helping to wear on terrorism and is working to a working. To include candidate and have to contrast to help rebuild her. And as fair while phone call to be tearing premise to Jean Cretjian. He thanked me for what we're doing in Afghanistan. And for the offer of money and the reconstructive Iraq. Rachel to the news conference yesterday as for the news in the newspaper stating that Candida would be excluded from economic activities. activities the President assured me this was not the case and that he'd be taking action Christians said so I thanked him were still good friends. Me and that moron were still good friends. The US announced this wait that countries which did not support the US-led war in Iraq last spring including Canada would not be allowed to bid on reconstruction contracts worth $18 billion. But Christians said Bush called yesterday was basically telling me not to worry. The Prime Minister who retires today received a call before A.A.A. yesterday the President said that the President's exact words on the issue were we are working to rectify the situation that Christians spoke to him and Steve in a hole. Probably Kim do a Ben Wall-Hogue. Bush's comments to Christians seem to fly in the face of what he was saying at home. In other words he's getting more like Christians talking out of both sides of his mouth. Now I take that back, Christian only talks out of one side of his mouth. He told reporters in Washington Bush did on Thursday that countries which sent troops to Iraq should share an e-murcan finance reconstruction projects while other nations are shut out. What is our Guinness? What I'm saying is in fact the Bush will be in the Guinness Booker Records. What I'm saying is the expenditure of the taxpayers' money the US people the taxpayers understand why make sense are countries that risk lives to participate in the contracts in Iraq. It's very simple. Our people risk their lives from the coalition folks risk their lives and therefore the contractions are going to reflect that. Presidential spokesman Scott McClubley said will be glad to discuss the issue with you when asked about Canada's status. The upcoming Prime Minister Paul Martin said today that he couldn't fathom the US move to shut it to northern neighbor, especially if Canada's put nearly $300 million for Iraq reconstruction. Canadian troops in Afghanistan are also carrying a very, very heavy load in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan. Martin said he said he'd raised them out of the US ambassador. Deputy Prime Minister John Manley suggested Canada to make cut aid to a rack and respond to the US snub. President Bush talked about ten minutes yesterday. Bush congratulated the credit card on your very, very distinguished and honorable career. Cretion was very moved. The Prime Minister said to Bush, you know we've had a few disagreements in the path of relations between our two countries have never been better. The chat was described as very warm and cordial. The two leaders have never formed a kind of bondcretion enjoyed with former US President Bill Clinton. There was an infamous incident just over a year ago when former Cretion Press aide Francois DuCro called Bush a moron. He lost your job after Cretion's attempted to tender widely mocked in the US media and they squeezed around. And I guess they're forgetting that also was Cretion himself shortly after Bush took off as he said. Basically the same thing. A mole of saluting. Ron. Well here's some good news. You'll be pleased about that you'll feel safer here in this. Okay. A driver in his passion, you're crashed through the gates of the Florida Governor's Mansion and it just stole an car from nearby Parkan. Law doesn't appear.

Card didn't hit the mansion, nobody was injured. The car they zoomed right through the Northgate when right off the Southgate later were caught for the carbine stolen.

Said the source to small town of Altus wasn't prepared for the havoc that Paris and Nicole had in store and it goes on a great line in the December 23rd in Quarce that there you go again another bitch. Yeah. Now getting to the meat of the matter. First the New York TV news before we get to the inquarer story. The York TV news today says. Rush Limbaugh's spin team came up with a secret plan to say their boss after the conservative commentator admitted he was addicted to painkillers the New York TV news learned yesterday. The plan involved taking up former senator Bob Dull's offer to help the embattled radio joc and suggesting he read a supportive letter to Newsweek magazine. The October 13 memo to prepare radio networks president Craig Kitchen obtained by the news also recommended doing a survey of Rush's listeners to gauge the reaction to Limbaugh's embarrassing admission. If results are positive we can use PR with station advertisers and media the memo states if not we don't have to publicize. It also were just great to send memo to Congress with updates on coverage advertised in a affiliate feedback. Confended with her memo, Limbaugh spokeswoman Kevin Bellos said the Congress was referring to was she was referring to was the senior management team at the Premier Radio Network's ride. As for Dull Bellos said he offered to help after Newsweek did an unflattering story about Limbaugh's addiction and the criminal investigation of his alleged suppliers Dull didn't return a call for comment. Limbaugh hasn't been charged with a crime and repeatedly is denied being the target of Lord Investigator is probing a black market pain killer ring he went into rehab as video yada yada yada. Fearing that Limbaugh who once called for jailing junkies may be branded a hypocrite and lose the loyalty of his right wing listeners his team's spring into action. Post to call to wax nonsensical website telling his audience the best way they can support him is the stay tuned with local station fellows wrote let the station know they're listening to the program. And additionally providing addresses for rushes fans to send letters Bellos recommending getting the message out that Limbaugh's advertisers would stay loyal to the show assuming not pouring a protest in our state we alert the wall street journal. Limbaugh was his usual liberals vanshing self when he returned their way of last month with his audience apparently intact. A short time later investigators and thwart his Palm Beach County where Limbaugh lives in splendor seized his medical records and suggested he went doctor shopping it was the first sign Limbaugh could face criminal charges for buying black market drugs. Next week, a general decide whether the medical records should be made public. Bellos said the records show that Limbaugh's addiction stem from his numerous medical problems and they want to make public. Also yesterday and I have it in my hand right now the National Enquirer reported that the police web is tightening round rush limbaugh and they could be arrested in just a matter of days. Oh please Limbaugh's lawyer right black yesterday called the tabloid story pure fabrication and a thinly veiled attempt to destroy Mr. Limbaugh's reputation in theory right. Lot that up your ass you know. Just like somebody once said in fatso remember that scene junior. No I don't remember that. When we're seeing in the song about the something boys whatever the the the Napoli boys. Oh. Lot that up to the day. Yeah, lot that up to the IRS. So that was a dom bell we said that to junior one of the keys to the he wanted the keys to the refrigerator the coverage baby. Don't you remember that? I did the keys get the honey junior. You just you're not into it. Anyway I got it in my hand right now. What charges could come down against drug scandal players police web closing in on rush. I also got a great story about somebody that you were really like a lot. Roy. Cone. No. Why undergo a secret surgery you place part of his skull. Yeah. He just has like a little hole in it and it's head to how's it holding up. Well, look at to him eventually got a lot of crap here today. Boy, a lot of facts is pouring into the almost like we have an audience or something. Police web closing in on rush. Talking pin had four docs feeding his bill. Have it say authorities and here's a picture. Rush with his glove. His golf glove on one hand. His hearing aid in place in his ear and smoke at a big fat stogi. It says the news is tightening the Palm Beach County's task forces investigating Limbaugh's doctors. The police web is tightening around rush Limbaugh and his suspected drug suppliers as the inquire on the arrest of key figures including rush could come soon. The inquire has learned exclusively. Record seized by Palm Beach County Task Force investigators alleged the talk show host got overlapping prescriptions for powerful pain killers only days apart. More than 2,000 pills over approximately a five-month period this year. Mr. Limbaugh's actions violate the letter in spirit of Section 893.13 commonly known as Dr. Shopping States Research War in Application of File and the Cirqueur to Palm Beach County. According to the search warrant application, no fewer than four physicians wrote prescriptions for Limbaugh in the week just partly inquire is blockbuster exclusive in October exposing Limbaugh's massive drug addiction. After police raids on the offices of Limbaugh's doctors, a source posted investigation of all to the inquire where Rush Limbaugh is currently part of a major criminal investigation could face a risk. We saw the medical professionals mention in search once for his medical records. The names of at least two other doctors allegedly involved in the dispensing of large quantities of prescriptions and medications have been given to investigators. This investigation could also soon result in the arrest of doctors. Oh yeah, this is sweet. Oh right. Armed with the war, investigators seized the 52-year-old conservative Kingpins medical and prescription records from two medical officers on November 25 and a mind-boggling allegation. The search warrant application claimed that one physician prescribes 60 tablets of North Pole and extremely potent pink color August 28th and 240 more the very next day. Oh, back in April the same doctor also prescribed 84 North Pole tablets on the 15th and 180 more only nine days later according to the war and application. 84 tablets on the 15th, 180 more nine days later, boy he must have been in a lot of pain. In the inquire's world exclusive expose in October Rush's housekeeper Wilma Klein confession provided Rush with massive quantities of pain killers. Now she reveals radio-small successful top king fear leaving a paper trail by dealing with doctors. I need pain pills, but a man in my position can't afford to have be looked ridiculous. I can't afford to have his name on a doctor's prescription Rush explained according to Wilma. The housekeeper quits a plan Rush into lie 2002 and she told the inquire that if he broke his gold and ruled by turning the doctors for drugs he must have become absolutely desperate recently. Rush returned to the airways of number 17 following five weeks in rehab received prescription medication of a controlled substance in the year 2003 from four different positions between March 24th and September 26th 2003 according to a search warrant reported by test court before agent max devali. These prescriptions were issued sometime in the same week and less than 30 days apart. How many? God, third man. The radio host never told individual doctors that he was receiving pain pill prescriptions from other physicians in order to obtain excessive amounts of controlled substances to support his addiction reads the search warrant application. Four doctors named in the search warrant supplied limbo with two thousand 130 pills court records claim that pills included Norco, Osi Kahn, Lorset, Hygro Kodon and Kadyan. What the was that? You know, nothing I've heard of. Limbaugh's attorney, Roy Black claims Rush's the victim of a fishing expedition by prosecutors of targeted him because of his well-known political opinions added. Rush Limbaugh is not part of a drug ring he was never a target of a drug investigation. But, but state attorney, very crissure quickly had back he referred to the ongoing investigation Mr. Limbaugh and added. It is not my office policy to come and of an open police investigation. Whether Mr. Limbaugh's subject to prosecution or any crimes is still under investigation. That's almost as shocking as that memo about. Our QAman is searching for a new morning of sports talent.

Small potato so far. Let me say it again, Norm. Your facts machine is screwed up. You don't know what you're doing. And that great one somebody fancy you something that comes out like a blank sheet of paper. Oh, that's free paper. It's kind of like when the equipment is screwed up.

By the way, Joe just called and a bunch of people have come by, but no one has bought CDs and no one has bought a toy. So, so what does that mean? They've come by for what?

Oh, speaking of animals. I'm going to go a secret surgery through a place part of his skull. What are you laughing about this story? This is sad. No, it's not. It's sad. No, come on. It's sad. Las Vegas legend. Roy. Horne is undergone secret life-saving surgery. Replace part of his skull that had been removed after he was severely mulled by a 600-pound tiger the inquire of his learned. Who was trying to save him? He was trying this. Of course, even as the tiger teaming a timing half of secret and Roy tried to battle back after the growing six hour operation. His partner, sick for his locked in his own battle with insurance companies to get him to cover. The enormous expenses. Sources say doctors waited till December the 5th to do the surgery because they needed Bro, could be strong enough to withstand the rigorous replacing that section of the skull that had been implanted in his abdomen for safekeeping after the attack. The section of his skull that had been implanted in his abdomen for safekeeping after the attack. Are you ready for that? That's a pretty doctor-friacant. The lines. Do you? I know we had a storage pouch in there. The painstaking operation took so much out of the famed illusionist who had been breathing on his own. That sources say he went to the ICU after surgery and was put back out of ventilator. It's one step forward to clear the source post to. And a half step back. He's certainly not out of the woods, but he survived the six hour brain surgery. And that's a good sign by itself. SIGPLY remains in an emotional turmoil. He also wants to cover that he wants to be recovered so badly. He's the loot himself and a thinking his partner already has made a miracle recovery. The truth is as far as conditions concerned it's still touch and go. Touch and go. Kind of like my ass on the toilet tonight to go. Touch and go. Thanks, Dr. Rackens. That's not Dr. Bob. Believe me, if he were still alive, they didn't have to put those things out. Those indulged. He was already starting to get into it with those advantage bars and whatnot. The advantage bars have been around for years. They don't make you crap your brains out? No, they just taste like. That's the choice. That's it. No, no, seriously. I think he just touched on it. You fell into a pile of crap. Always touching it. Either it tastes like crap or it if it tastes good, it makes you crap. Yeah. So knowing between that's the thing with this losing weight. You can't get away from the crap. Right. Right. Anyway, getting back to the important stuff about Roy. His commissioner still touched and go. It's been that way since the tiger grabbed. I'll be showing it on a bigger stage in front of a horrified the group of fans October 3rd. Now, what I wanted to say horrified from what we were hearing. They thought it was part of the show, remember? Right. And some of us might be related. I don't want to question the inquiries. Viracity, accuracy here, but to get with it. Soon after, Dr.'s head removed a portion of his skull because his brain had swollen and was pressing against the bone. What if nothing worse than when there's a brain pressing against your bone? If the pressure got too great, Roy would die. Doctors placed a skull in his abdomen to keep the tissue viable. Sources say, Roy is airlifted from Vegas to UCLA in Los Angeles, October 28th, because the couple's Hollywood friends told sick breed his best chance for survival was in a caracalifornia specialist. Slowly. Roy. Made progress. He could open when I seemed to be emerging from the coma. Says the source. The biggest step was when Dr. is finally took him off the ventilator. He was able to breathe on his own. They find with the side he was well enough for undergo the operation. It was a success. But now, the insurance company is saying sick freed moved from the LA hospital where went after the attack without getting permission from their carrier. And therefore, they may not cover his medical bills say inside. So when you go on C. Joe Costello, they give some extra money for Roy. Roy. Right? No. All sick freed wants his the best possible health care for his potten of the source said. Roy. Means everything in the world, the him is devotion to his heart-wending. Sick freed is terribly distraught over the insurance where the tapies had over the paper pushers and it's driving him mad. Hopefully Roy will fully recover the insurance company will pay the bills for it right now, it could go either way on both counts. Woo. Pretty spooky, huh? Yeah. Don't let me forget. Maybe I'll do it in the one of clock hour. That article by David Corn, editor of the nation. Author of the Lysa George W. Bush, mastering the politics of deception. About the horn and says, don't let me forget. Okay, don't. Just make some buzzing sounds like horn and sound remember. Oh, what is with all these faxes here? Good. Got all mighty. Charles and dear field beats. Don't know if you got this fax on Wednesday. I hope any statements that can't always live there. Uh, verse number for today. Show got it. And what is this other stuff on here that goes on and on and on and on. Charles and dear field beats. I don't got time for that in the middle of the show. Charles, thank you so much. Here's what it says. What is it about religion that you hate so much? Is it just Christianity or all religions? I'd appreciate some intelligent insights as I have problems with religion myself. Let me just tell you this, whoever this is from, is it got an A-mon at no. But whoever this is a del computer preferred customer. Ha ha ha ha. Are you excited about that? It's all about your fairy tales. It's all about your hate. Religion is a big tax exempt business that teaches people to hate and go to war and kill each other. Not just Christianity, not just Judaism, not just Muslims and all this other crap. It's all of them. They're all crap. Their man made fairy tales for morons. That's the answer to your questions.

Bush's bacon from the fire in fact there may be no way out it's not much fun to be gloomy about a war that Bush now says was fought to bring democracy to the repressed people of Iraq while they can't keep singing went to find weapons of mass destruction yet Bush is stuck in a hole of his own digging pulling out of Iraq and leaving the Iraq to their own devices and the mercy of numerous vathas thugs would be an immoral act but staying in Iraq is a capire seem at this moment a problem at a position as well a few days ago the York Times noted on the front page that the u.s. is adopted Israeli-like tactics in Iraq jailing the relatives of suspected insurgents demolishing buildings that might have been used by the anti-merking guerrillas surrounding whole villages in barbed wire and the article quoted captain Todd Brown a company commander in the area of one fence to invillage observing you have to understand the Arab mind the only thing they understand is force forced pride in saving face. Bush can deliver noble speeches pledging a decades along u.s commitment to democracy in Iraq and the Middle East deputed defense secretary wolfwitz could articulate lofty reasons for the occupation of Iraq but captain Brown others like him are the ones who are in a way making the policy in Iraq with their attitudes and the interactions with Iraqis. I don't be grudge ground his hard-ass position for which he's been placed in a tough spot. What is chilling is that his remark may be a more accurate description of the realities of u.s. policy and Iraq than anything concected by a White House speech writer. Was the American public informed before the war that success in Iraq would depend upon practices that were increasingly failing and falling in the disrepute within Israel? Almost every week another former or soon to return a senior military official in Israel confesses that aerial shirones hit them with a stick policy has not only failed but has been counterproductive. So when u.s. faces a situation in which the military had to imprison Iraqis with their own villages it's not quite fair to demand that critics propose a sure fire remedy to the Iraq problem. What is there to say? Picket fences instead of barbed wire? The democratic presidential candidate to each blast of the occupation imposed similar alternatives in Iraq. They generally argue that Bush must turn over the occupation of the United Nations and that's such a handoff would pave the way for internationalizing the military action in Iraq. The resumption is that if the Bush administration yielded control over the political and economic developments in Iraq sorry, Haliburton, then the other nations of the world will be willing to send troops to Iraq to assist the U.S. there. This is an untested assumption. But as the war becomes uglier, who said anything about barbed wire, is it likely that other nations will deploy troops to Iraq for what is not a peacekeeping mission but a counter-insurgency operation? More over could a multilateral force be more successful and vanquishing the insurgents which is now the challenge at hand than the U.S. military. It's pretty to think that the UN can make things right in Iraq but its a notion based more our hope than fact. It could happen? But fortunately for the Democratic candidates Bush shows no signs of replacing Paul Bremor with Kofi-Anan. I say fortunately because this means that Democrats can continue to advocate such a course and claim they have something to offer beyond criticism of Bush even if their proposal has obvious shortcomings. I don't fault them, they have to have their own plans, but no one should imagine that just as an approach would definitely succeed, and maybe the only option we're trying but let's be real, it's no slam dunk. Recently Anthony Cortison, a military expert of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, produced a series of the pressing studies on the war in Iraq. A report on U.S. intelligence on the missing WMDs in Iraq notes? Even a cursory review of U.S. and British charges about Iraq's WMD capabilities shows that point after point that was made was not confirmed during the war or after the first two months following the conflict. The U.S. and Britain went to war with Iraq without the level of evidence needed to provide a clear strategic rationale for the war. In a paper on the current fighting in Iraq, he says that neither side of the U.S. and the insurgents can now achieve their original grand strategic objectives. This is forced each side to limit its objectives to the point where neither side may be able to win in grand strategic terms. It's true he observed that Bush did end the regime of a cruel dictator but failed to achieve the objective of removing an urgent and imminent threat because there's no evidence such a threat existed. More on the point of what to do now than he writes the U.S. may be able to give her back significant new opportunities but won't be able to shape her rack-in-away modern democracy or free market economy. The U.S. will have to leave long before the political economic and energy issues in Iraq playout and immaculate in face years of not a decade of instability. A decade of instability? Dick Cheney never said anything about that. Court has been also maintained the situation in Iraq is far more likely to compound U.S. problems with Islamic movements than reduce them and will probably produce a significantly less secular regime over time. That is if a secular regime does emerge from the political mess in Iraq and court has been asserts, the U.S. is having mixed success in Iraq in part because it failed so dismal to effectively prepare for conflict termination, nation building, security missions and the risk of low-intensity conflict and because the Bush administration in any logical view of Iraq and the region was badly decoupled from reality. The couple from reality, I like that. How can one act reasonably or rationally in a situation board of delusion? Some things broken cannot be repaired, yes, morning will not make things better unless of course leads to Bush's replacement, and non-dolludional minds ought to try to find a path out of this mess. But it never should be forgotten that Bush weds an elective war based on a phony rationale that he did not prepare for the easy to force the aftermath and that he rushed in with his stick and that he unleashed the hornets their his fault. That's David Cornt in the nation. He poked it with a stick just like you were saying. Isn't that what you're saying to the ones stick? What? What? So Joe Castellos got 40 bucks out there and so the few toys and people are finally showing up. Let's not sell him short job. He's really doing it or so he says. And what was that he was talking about this money? He's raised for me in the past what century was that man? What did he dream that? Err? Talk about delusional. Okay, here's a facts. Boy, the facts are just pouring in here. I looked on the internet and found some other name, Brendan I. Colonel Rich Spurs. Plains have preceded you that your man or horn on the old was that. Underwent has been referred to as either a decompressive. What is that crane electing me or a hemocrine electing me? The former is considered a slightly less risk. Oh, I don't want to read all this about about what's his name. Ruh! Are you? No, no. I don't want to hear about his brain that used to be there. Thanks anyway, but we don't want to hear about Jim Boes says someone called or fact you were really about Russell Crowbing a racist. I have a similar story. I went last summer to LA to visit my best friend as I usually do. We go out and hang. I took him across Mr. Crow and up to Meshake his hand and the mother ever looked at me and started laughing as if to say, do you think I'll actually shake that Negro hand of yours? I don't want to say, no, no. He didn't say like the last call or Schwarz, he called me a nigger. If it wasn't for that tower he had next to him I'd have kicked his ass. A foul man. That's really lovely, isn't it? Yeah, nice guy. No, he's not. But that was a good movie. We liked the movie. We just hate his stuff. Like a Russell Crow makes a sick or stomach. Just because your talent to does not make you a nice person. No, first on. There's this plenty of people in show business. That's why we're taking this poll. You look up and down this list. I challenge you to name the other than Jack Nicholson who I like. And I mean, I mean, you don't know these people personally. Okay. So you never really know if somebody's a nice person. I didn't know them. But but yeah, let's face it. Is there much debate? We got a flatfooted tie for first place. Rosie O'Donnell. Another glove one. Rosie and Michael neck and neck nose to nose. Yeah. So I think she's got a leg up there. Look at Rush who rushed up the list. 63 of peace for them and Rush is just Russian. I've got a lot of that would explain a lot. No, he's now he'd be drinking vodka if he was Russian. Maybe he Russians by the way. Don't want to part him. Rush has got 44. Those former county bastards don't want to do with him. Dion Sanders doing very good. 36. He be doing good. J. L. 29 and Colver 18 at Skanky's Skabby bitch. Whitney Houston, Ansyg Rays Type, 12 of a piece. Maybe we can get Bobby Brown to be up.

Film a great list Taylor six just in Tinker Bell six Robert County, Jr. No relation to Joe Mars Jr. He's got five perusultant five, Boba Streisand five, Russell Croze got four that bigoted piece of crap Nicole Kidman for Jerry Lewis. Hello lady. He's got four. Ellen D. Jennifer has got three. Dike. Oh, and see, not that we don't like dice. We just don't like certain ones. And she and Rosie are two good examples. Speaking of that, you know, there have been lot of those rumors about Oprah, you know. Yeah, no, what do you don't want to mess with her with all that money? Oprah's got two Jack Nicholson two. Canter Reeves has got a pair. Mel Gibson only one. And Jessica Simpson only won. I'll 360 ad votes. Cutters him slack for Jessica. She's just a moron. Absolutely can help it. They cut her slack because of a rack. Or you can start with a rack stuff. I rack. It's okay if you say I rack, but not just plain old Ray, right? For Rallern at the hard way. And I want to say it. Brendan and Holly would said he's got a website. This link will take you to a homepage called The Propaganda Remix project.

This might soften up some of our listeners out there who aren't clean You know loose with a cash this year Tubby owner suit pines pets director dog falls ill and die Okay, what? Well, it's a terrible story yeah, and I think that if we start thinking about the animals and see That's the thing to me this hold and part this religion crap well man has the soul and the other animals are just there for our amusement Well, what an arrogant obnoxious discussion I bet in the golden retriever Bible doesn't say that that's right and in their Bible It just is you know just wag your tail and humor them They're animals anyway. Let them lose their souls something like that So that's what really irritates me is that's always an excuse well. I think just here for our convenience It's really tragic Cause I guarantee that most dogs are a hell of a lot better and most of the people on our poll list today. Hell of a lot better Puppy owner suit pines pets director dogs follow you and die six people claiming their puppies became sick or died Found a lawsuit yesterday against the Pembroke pines petster when they purchased the where they purchased the animals so says today son Sentinel The six planets including a mother and son who bought one of the puppies claim the owners of Wizard of Claws Misrepresented the quality of its puppies violating state law three dogs died to our alive the suit states The suit filed and borrowed chicken court come six weeks after a lawsuit was lodged against Puppy Palace Inc a pet store but locations in Hollywood and Bointon Beach That suits nine planets claim the store is also misrepresented the quality of its puppies In a suit file against the Wizard of Claws the plaintiff said the puppies hold by the store were sick Which inedic diseases such as hip display show a bleeding disorder and pneumonia The plaintiffs including two South Florida residents has to be reimbursed for the price of their dogs and vet bills Terry Vaughn's Sal a Cooper city was searching for a papillon puppy. What what is that? Is it a butterfly?

Amaged controls, so they can pitch in holes. He's going to the Rush the Grand Box. He's going to the Rush the Grand Box. He's going to the Rush the Grand Box. He's going to the Rush the Grand Box.

ABC News decision angers, Cassinucia and Brown. ABC News is it will stop having produces travel full time with a presidential campaigns of Kermosley, Brown, Dennis Cassinucia and Al Sharpton. How come he's not in the headline? I think it's a racial thing. Although she is, she's lighter. The network says it's a routine coverage decision but a Desangred Brown and Cassinucia especially after the Ohio congressman had a Test the exchange with ABC News's Ted Coffle during Tuesday's debate new hamster. I didn't see it, did you? No. Thank God. ABC said the change was designed a better deploy forces for the upcoming Iowa caucus and the first travel with the three candidates will continue to follow the campaigns by Phone even if these candidates don't frequently make it on the air on ABC News. The producers assigned them to contribute to the note. A widely read internet newsletter devoted to presidential politics and B.C. News has has young correspondence to sign to follow each of the nine candidates. CBS monitors each campaign but does never full time staffer with each. Cassinucia says while competing yesterday in New England College, I don't think ABC should be the first primary. The media is not going to be on a television network. Brown followed a following a former conquered high school in New Hampshire, since he was sorry to hear ABC News producer was leaving. If they don't want to help me get my message out, I have to find alternative ways to do it. I think it's a terrible commentary, however, on the state of the media, if they're the idea of democracy's only relating to those candidates for the most money. Fusin is criticized, coupled during Tuesday's debate for beginning with a question about the investment of Howard Dean. Later he was angry when copal asked whether he Brown and Churpet are in this sort of a vanity candidacy, because Senator applied, that may be he may be inconvenient for some of those in the media, but I'm sorry about that. There were really pissed off a couple's questions, but as an asshole. On Thursday, because Senator noted ABC's coverage decision in his criticism during the debate saying, if it's going to appear, ABC may have taken it personally. In other words, this was business and they're taking it personal at ABC. He should just go over it and just reach out and pull the couple's piece right off his head. And it's a good idea. I would've watched. I thought that was a comb over it. No, it's a... Are you ten-compo? Right? It's a how do you do any hairpiece, man? You better get with it. A comb over it. Man. Rush Limbois pulled away. I'm impressed. I'll tell you even I'm impressed by the astonishing. Lasting part, this is a top of crap. 90 votes.

What's better than a live radio show every morning on TV? Just about anything but that hasn't stopped MSNBC from teaming up with radios original bad boy who now looks like an nasty old lady. Listen Friday! I'm a sell-in intern as a coffee shop! Yes! Every morning, see, I'm a swiss-n-to-a-tape of other people's county myths. Live on the air. I need a hammer to bite into this muckin' you know somebody who has question plate I guess. See his wild behind the scenes at it. I also think he's doing it silently. I'm annual walrus cookbook at you and I get me some fresh coffee or your fire. I'm a he's irreverent. So I wasn't able to pull. He's topical. So I wasn't able with his water game play. He's incoherent. I'll tell you what. That's a double of a person. What does that? I don't know. He's a good standy story. And he's only on MSNBC. A cable channel nobody watches. And a bunch of AM radio stations go. But he listens to them. That's somebody got some fresh jingles. It's Ivers. 147. Be sure of much that. Anyway, I was watching sexy beast. I was trying to relax then. I couldn't get in. What I don't think it's going to be like a beautiful mind where I started watching it. And I did the finish and turn out to be a name with movie. Well, think about beautiful mind is what's you realize what's going on. And then all of a sudden then becomes riveting. Right. But it takes a hell of a long time to get from here to there. Well, it pulls you. But sexy beast. We're Ben Kingsley plays this nasty hateful obnoxious thug. And Ray Winston is like retired from the thugry business. You know, no longer against it. And it seems like 90% of the movie depart that I was. He's just a bank case. He's trying to talk him and go, well, you're going to do this job. And you're going to do it. No, not. And they, you know, pounds I'm a little bit. And yeah, you are. And I'm not. And I'm just sitting around the pool. And yes, he is. And this one is banging his wife. And that's it. I just wish they would have named it something else. Well, a beast of course. That throws a dark shadow over to an entire thing. In fact, when he comes to work, it throws a dark shadow over most of the block. Beast will be full in for George next week. By the way, he'll be sitting in your chair. Well, I better swap it out then, huh? Maybe he'll leave you something. I'll say this about the beast is he never stank up chairs when he sat on him. Unlike. What? Some people we know. The action to say that. I was thinking about her. I was thinking about her. No, I'm not thinking about her. You're thinking about Josh treatment because you want to take another gratuitous shot of him. Sure. Where is he working now? Is he over running on 940 or something? I don't know. I'll go ask. Josh. Josh. Somebody can tell you. Josh. I'm telling you. Somebody mentioned his name. That he's working on one of these supposed sports stations in town or somewhere. Better than that. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all. That's all I can say. That's a stench. So sexy beast that you never saw. No, no, don't. Don't. Okay. But it's not what is what we said. So highly touted and it's just that maybe it's one of those you have to sit down on a rough and just become fixated. I can't stick with that. I never heard it highly touted. Who told you it was good. Well, I'm on a sleeve. It says. Well, they must be on the sleeve. They had to nerve to actually put raver views as opposed to people going to the truth like, hey, don't buy this. It really sucks. You know stuff like that. And that's in that. Yeah. Plus, that kind of had me the long facts before he was right. How could we have left off London when we did that pull last week where you find the ugliest people in the world? See, I was so inspired by my trip to Montreal. There really was focusing zeroing in on them. But the British are 100 times earlier than those grotesque trigbolites in Montreal. Well, you wouldn't believe it. You just, you couldn't even begin to imagine. The percentage of ugly people in Britain believe you may. I feel like a beautiful guy there, like a beautiful mind and behind. Man, are they grotesque? It must be a genetic thing. I like he said, take a look at the world family. Mm-hmm. But all the buck teeth, you know, and the big ears, the big says. And keep it mind, of course, the batten birx aren't British anywhere. They're German, which is really strange because the German people are beautiful. Most of them, 180, 180, 180, go to England. They got kicked out. So the ones who, maybe that's what Hitler did. All the ugly ones, they had a ship off the England. The go-am. WCQ-A-M. Oh, yes sir. All right. Listen to your, um, once it gets George Bush on that pole. So business figure, what show business figure? Yeah, George is George Bush on a pole. Uh, I'm so glad it's almost too o'clock. Like I said, these last three shows have just zipper out on by real quick. But, ah, I'm glad it's almost too o'clock. Ain't you? Oh, yeah, lots. We got a final total from Joe Custell, a lot here in T. He did more than 250, I'll bet your life on it. 320. See, I told you, 320. Not bad Joe. First, I'm going to recommend you for little, uh, grease ball. I threw away the final total of them. Boy, am I a, I got it. I got it. I got it, relax. Go ahead and say today, we had 45,000. I don't know what the hell we got. We had 45,000, 45. We did 503 yesterday, right? Okay. I'm trying to, like, keep, ah, I don't feel it. Whatever. Like I'll worry about that. Let me give it to you. I'll stuff that I do. Okay. After he skins a little. After he won. What? What? You pick it on Miguel again? No. I bet he's back there. Cherry picking all of that crap that, uh, that other one used to, like, uh, take on, let's hope. Yeah. Are we going to see her again? Who? The one that used to be there in promotions that we can't talk about because she's suspended, but we're not supposed to be mentioning you on the air. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh. No. We are no one good thing. We like Torres Stratford on this program. All right. Okay. Troy to boy. We like him a lot. We like to rub his bald head. He's like a slightly darker, complicated Buddha. Just keep it down to a two drink minimum. That's right. He just can't handle his booze. That's all. And he can't handle certain other things. All right.
