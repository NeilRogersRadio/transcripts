They're always honoring why did the players get you as a money? Chies that lives in the past why do they get US money if they live in Canada and Error is occur on my page here. Can you believe that I can't believe it? Why is it that Canadian hockey players that play in Canada get US money? Because they got good agents. That's why I guess so because why the NHL is an American sport in Pader US money too if you had a good idea I thought they said that was the Canadian sport. It must be an American sport because it's in New York a bunch of losers But you're American. There's Duffas and Keybuckers Duffas and Keybucker fan of feedback. Did you know that? Oh, that's right.

It is phenomenal Okay, Michael more for president. Oh, that's what I say he'd be the best Dan rather's an asshole. I want to mention that even though I've been watching CBS news for years. See here's the difference Here's the difference Walbert Kronkai who used to be of course for many many years The respected father of American news on CBS TV he retires they shove him into the background But he still I got the presence and the the conscience to keep writing these columns in different newspapers and appear on the king myster things like that and the speaking out against the war what an asshole bushes But in the meantime here his successor Dan rather Who everybody knows is a Texas liberal which is unusual, but nevertheless and he still comes on there and sucks up to what end Distorts and twist the news like everybody else and goes on king and says well I'm an American I have to do that which I never realizing until I read this book Are you ready for that? No, I'm not enough to make me almost watch Tom Brokoss see I would I would turn over to NBC news permanent If they would put Brian Williams on there all the time yeah Brian Williams is great. He's an excellent You know I've been a word broke us as right you can't he's got a terrible speech defect He's gonna have naked pictures of the peacock and everybody else associated with general electric because there's no other way in the world He would be on there Tom Brokoss at a squeeze So I would definitely watch them if they would just put Brian Williams at or at least call me at home And let me know what nice brown lady must be doing the note not and then I will have to be watching Dan turn coat rather You make me sick Dan. I've lost any respect I ever had for you your piece of crap Everybody please go out and buy the book today Dude wears my country Michael more his a genius is a freaking genius who's got a big big smelly pair nice gone Mike Here's the result from Friday from your poll Who has the most obnoxious sounding on the by the way speaking of the George being on his poll things like that? It's about time that the audience has been ripping George and ass and sometimes deservedly so for all this time Realizes that this summer book. He finally broke out of the pack I'm looking at the hour by hour here at the shares from the summer book the four highest hours In terms of rating and in terms of People listening Well, I'm actually managed to end the rating 777 and 3 to 4 hours, but but forget about that But in terms of people listening are tend to each and every one of our four hours And George was on I would say well of course September I was on Right, but July and August you went like more than 50 percent I was on maybe percent and George was on the rest of the time especially August when I get a week off in there So all these and I would also want to save this instead been away and even I can go online and read whatever I want I wouldn't waste my time with a son sentland here or what I'm an Amsterdam, but I'm sure there must be a whole bunch of articles about the rating right Kevin Jack there and I'm jica I'm all these people have it. They were in the in the gym Sarny that grow test piece of turd that fat tub piece of crap and very jackass with a little brown paper sack Didn't they write all kinds of stuff about Qaman is big summer book Know about how George and you have this gigantic number and even Mohad a number That was beautiful for us for well did the good and really good in this first full book Huh, did I write that now how mad dog and Hank were spectacitor any afternoon?

No, did you get as well? Huh? I shouldn't open up a mountain so I know what we're actually gonna have on there Oh, you mean like a lot more? I don't know you know it's worth mentioning since we're talking about the Online store that these other products that that they have are really yeah Would have been nice to somebody would have told me about it. Why didn't know? I just saw the pictures online. I didn't know that these mugs were actually huge and substantial by the way Don't miss skin on fox TV on foxa. See that's the interesting thing This son of a bitch this group of Murdoch What a clever devious man.

You gotta take with the old bitch and die. Don't forget it's out this way, square and with a carotography. One of the pink, one of the stink. It's 133 at 560WQM1382 votes on George's pool. It's taken me a long time to get around with this. Yeah, we got a lot of catchin' up to do. Who has the most up, not just sounding accent, draw or a speech pattern? George asked, New Yorker is for 115. Blacks, mini ebonics, 263. Why did you have to put ebonics in there? Why can you just sit and dart off? I just wanted to make someone with confused. And let me see, you got black Islanders down here. Are there any black Islanders, Scott? Sure. Maybe one black player on the Islanders. Speaks 127. Old Jews, hundred and twelve. Hicks 86, you had to like that Hicks thing. I would like Julian 7, sort of describe it. Drilling Souther's, Yahoo's. Flaming Queen 69. What an interesting number of votes. Haitian 69. What about flaming Queen Haitian? Come on. Talhead's 46. You there at that many Talheads in South Florida. No, that's quite many. That's why it smells a little bit better there. New Englander's 43. Frog's 43. Surf punks. I don't have any fouls. I have no idea what that means. I'm sure by the 22. I don't want to know what that is. Crowd's 21, Scott. Black Islanders 19. Kevin Weiss never played for down. Where's today? No. Brits 18. Goose 7. Goose. Conooke 7. Midwesterners 7. Comey blockers. General with that is either. I know beta blockers. Comey to block member. Oh, comey blockers. I see. What does see this is George being so much hipper and cooler that I am. Comey blockers 5. Philly is 2. And mix one. Ha ha ha ha. Mix one. How about Tom mix this? Yeah, mix this is right. How come I can't find my damn thing here. I'm looking for it. Oh, I got an idea. No, probably because I don't want to have my glasses. Yeah, I'm just going to ease back into this. I'm going to make tell you something. My crum. Yeah, that's what I was looking for. But I was having trouble finding because I can't see what they're doing over here. Oh, I do like this. Do you know who I am? I'm more green. I made my bones when you were going out with jelly. Exactly. So there you go. There's a result from your world famous pool. New York is with an axiom and it just. Oh, something about it makes us nauseous. Makes us want to puke. Especially when you do a talk show like this and you talk to so many of them all the time. You can always tell. Oh, it's richy from boys head. It's a marked adjacent. By the way, the jets are sucked. They lost again yesterday. I just mentioned that in passing and guess who beat them. It couldn't have been done. I'm going to make nab in and fill it off the Eagles could have been. Oh, why is one of them? And the bills. They took it up the pipe. Man, that was beautiful. Did you see a neck in front? I heard it. They were briefly ahead. Two to nothing. Safety, which was kind of amusing. But they lost about 600 to five, which are like the bills blow. Yeah. So I can the dolphins are going to take it up to pipe and say the egg and I, one of the big ups and I said, our dolphins ever got to play a real team. And it seems to me correct me if I'm wrong, Scott. But while I was away, wasn't there an overtime game there would be between the Patriots and the dolphins? Yes, there was. And didn't Olando Marae. He kicks up didn't he miss a 235 year of field goals at overtime? No, one in regulation and one in overtime. Right. And didn't Tom Brady throw like a 65 year touchdown pass to win again? Yes, he did. So it seems to me to funnel squirnicking was the, a dog the dolphins 13 and the new England Patriots 19. I could be wrong, but I don't think so. Now that's correct, sir. Let's see. Here's a loyal listener, Factsy Mason information. It says for your info, Brian Williams is a right wing pig. Wait to the right. Check him out sometime on his own shows on cable. He's brutal. Another one that's spread the lie after lie about Al Gore in 2000 for incompetent Unelected fraud. Not that I'm defending Brokaw. He got 50. I mean, I was a well, I'm just saying Brian Williams at least I can tolerate his newscasts. You know what I'm saying? You can understand. This is try ABC and Peter Jennings. No, if I want to see Canadians doing news, I'll watch the news right here. The Canadians doing news. I don't need to see that right poor Pete. But the other way, see need to see Tom Pete Peter Jennings. I can't see. It's a spy. I was a turn on a BBC, see whatever it is. It says I've switched them. They seem to be the network that goes down the middle more than any of them. But they're all bad these days. You're correct. And it would be amazed. You folks out there would be shocked to see that CNN international is got like a totally different approach on the war and on everything in the world and on rums filled and everything. They're just just excoried and just ripping the bush mice to an ass. And it's whole Iraq nightmare that's going on this quagmar that he's got us into. Just a time because CNN international is generally speaking broadcasting to the rest of the world who are involved all this crap. You know, taking on this the ballooning. So it's really astonishing to me that they got a whole different altitude about on CNN international, which I guess you can get if you have like direct TV right? Okay. How many people in the US are watching that? About 30 men. It says by the way, fat faced blovier to Tim Russell said the same thing is rather after 9.11 that he was an American first, which is bulge mid. The media should be totally neutral. How else can they get the viewers to know what's going on? So I know that America's full of morons, but when they don't get unfiltered news, how can they possibly know what the F is going on? And the answer is they can't. Can they? No. So thank you for your good point. Okay. How's the pool coming on because I did hear guilty this morning? I knew it wouldn't take long. Oh, the stadium. We gotta get the stadium bill right there. We sure don't want to build it by a PP park. No, we don't want to build a stadium. First of all, we don't want to build it by any way. It takes a lot of money, but I do live in Broward. Thank you. But the point is why would you want to build it in a place where it's so convenient today, Broward and Palm Beach? Right there off the turnpike. Right there by the county line. You could throw a rock from there to county line road, right? But that would be a bad idea. Yeah, that would be a really, really bad idea to build a worse convenient to everybody with a lot's roll empty with a lot of water. Or maybe they have like Wayne, we negotiate the deal there with a Marlins, which he was certainly wouldn't do that because that would be like doing something benevolent. That wouldn't just be out of pure greed and being a real prick, which he is. That's the only hope that they got because this all this shenanigans that are going on behind closed doors again and may or the asses this sinis once is that and may or pinga pecanius. It's all going on behind closed doors. The deal will be sealed and you taxpayers are going to get fleece again. It's going to happen. And there's guilty. Only on this radio station when your assels coming on here like guilty. Say, oh wow, let's figure out where we're going to put it. Not are we going to do it, but it's already in his mind to done deal. Because like the astute mo mo my stir of sublip saying over and over again. Oh, you don't want to be in a city where you don't have baseball anymore. Oh god. Yeah. Would you, would you want to be in a place where you don't have basically baseball? What would I do? For example, right here in Toronto with the blue jays ever like I can't even imagine being here in no mo. I can't imagine being in this town. It would not be blue jays would be like being in the desert. It would be like being in a tenth world country or something. It's still have the Argonauts. Like I said, who the hell give us a crack? Hundred and how many votes we got on this thing? A lot of votes already. I totally their Marlon intensive 143 votes. We got another Marlon pull coming up later. What's your take on a new stadium for the world champion Marlon? Not just the ordinary pedestrian Marlon's. The war freaking champion Marlon's boys and girls. None of my tax dollars of bill that say 69 and at 143 it's almost half. Let's do what they deserve at 36. 25.1% of the people are still sniffing their all in the state of euphoria. I don't give a crap about a 23 and it was great but good by Marlon's 15 out of 143.

Hundred ninety one votes on a pool. Well, I think we're off to it. What did we do this was this on the Thursday before the provocation. We also had that staggering or is it a couple days before that? I don't remember that far. And that day? No. We had to fund that phenomenal. Oh. I think it was like over 800 during the show alone. Hundred ninety one. What's your well? Of course they ought to be whipped up about the marlins. We're world champs. Huh? When I think about it, I get the cramps without the M. Hundred ninety one votes. What's your take on a new stadium for the World Champion Marlins? None of my tax dollars going to build that sucker. Ninety one people. 47.6%. Let's do a theta-servant. 49.25.6%. And keep in mind we're doing this pool right on the heels of Saturdays. Game six. They're the clinching victory. Too nothing. Right there in Yankee Stadium. You know what? Maybe the happiest about that? I give up. Is George F. and Stein better man? Even you should be happy. Oh yeah. Just just to piss him off. Just because he's such a prick. I can't stand people who have a lot of money who act like assholes. I don't begrudge anybody who's got a lot of money. If they earned it or stole it or whatever. And if they were clever enough to do it. But at least if they're like a little bit humble or maybe not humble is not the right word. But like invisible out of my way. Well whatever. Not evil. But when you're like a real domineering prick like George Steinbren who was hated by virtually everybody. Not to mention of course his little gangster passed all his problems that he had. Not to mention all that on top of it. What a piece of turd man. Scott did you see the look on his post when they kid they showed up was late in the game. Was like obviously was all over. I don't know what it devastated was anything. Oh my god he had it. It looked like oh I can't wait to get this thing over. So I can go down and bitch everybody out. We lost. Too bad Steinbren are you suck. 198 votes 94 say none of my tax dollar going to build it. 51 let's do what they deserve it. That's 25.7% because I'm sure that the Samson and the Lyle of people over there in Jeffrey Loria. I'm sure there's glued to the radio wanting to find out just exactly how much they've put to the wall over to you. Of course they don't need to get the public support because they're pulling all those strings behind the scenes like I said close their meetings government in the dark. Mayor Pinga Picania Mayor Manny Diaz during the Miami they'll put together some kind of a sweetheart deal and they'll give them all of this land and they'll do it and then you'll have another white elephant just like that Miami arena anybody planer these days. Oh. I don't give a crap about a 35 say that and it was great but goodbye Marlins. I don't think it's going to happen again anytime soon. Right. It's first day after they dump off all the salary. You think Pudge is going to be bad? No. And there's zero to his contract. Right. And if he knows stuff crossing himself already and pointing to the sky. I'm always going to bring we've got to bring back Jackie Gleason one time just to send his answer to the moon and go ahead tell you that that would like increase the size of the moon like double send Pudge's ass up there. Is there anybody in baseball got a bigger ass than Pudge Rodriguez? A right. Huh? A right. I think what's his name? Cecil Fielder had a bigger ass. Yeah. Bigger everything. And a Mickey and Mickey. How do you know he had a bigger everything? He played in New York. He had a bigger everything. But what a loaded line at is Scott. I think you've been hanging around that station too long. Huh? You're starting to turn into one of them. Your ex-wife ain't going to be too crazy here and about that. In fact, your child support just went up. Do you have any kids? A certainly does he pay child support George? Yes. Say, is there you go? So you can't say a fudge me, Pudge. Your child support just doubled because of what you just said. Because now she knows you're fooling around with guys on a side. Which is why he sounds a little off his feet today because Muff ain't there to keep him happy. His wing muff isn't in keyweights for fat if he fath. Oh my god. What a flamery. You know what? Good off this. What a screamer. I think he is. Opera is one getting off this. That wouldn't surprise me. Man, oh man. People like that. People like go to places like Key West and Providence Town and Amstudam. We're talking things. We're talking about that stuff. Right. Toronto. Faggarious. What we're talking about. Make no mistake. I'm not a good piece of news though. This will make you people much happier. Leave it to me to come back and cheer you up a little bit. I could take some of those calls. I'd take one call before I give the good piece of news from any of that. Sure. From Rome. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes. I'm a good friend. I'm a good friend. Very weak. Very lame effort. Okay. Plus he's got all I remember. Get a new phone. Come on. Pettles and drugs. Here's a call from Orlando. Hello. Yes sir. What do you think about those announcers on the World Series that Jack Buck? What about him? He's pretty damn good. He's good. He's okay. He's not a foul or shot in the car. Can the car be a sin that he'll feel so he did ever shut up? Well he's not. He's worth the least in his pocket. He's worth the least in his pocket. He's a pain in the ass. But I mean that Jack Buck is great. I mean funny. Jack Buck is dead. This is his son. This is Joe Buck. Joe. Right. But what why don't you two excited about the model? It was a great, great up playoff. Come on. I'm the one that told everybody that they were going to win a series. Everybody laughed at me all year long and they said, Yeah. He's nobody can beat the Yankees. What do you say that? What do you want me to do? Jump up and down. Make you feel better? No. I mean, but have some civic fries. This is great. I mean, I talked to Ed. Ed capital about it and we're going to throw a party. Yeah. And I mean, I mean, get into a deal. Get lost. He's an orcon from Orlando and he thought he's going to throw a party. Just another front running phony jumping on the bad wagon. You couldn't give a flying crap about tomorrow. Let's be forward to God damn playoffs. And especially the world series 66,000 people there for game number five. 66,000 give or take. And just like Ferrell said this morning, the home opener. And after the home opener, the second home game next season. I'll have like a 6, 7,000 people there. Am I right? Absolutely. We all know that. Nothing's changed. I mean, it was exciting. And like I said, but he wants me to sit or hey, we love them. But where do you want me to do like a crap in my pants? Get all excited. That'd be funny. I'll retry that way to hear this. A tight in court, bands crucifixes from school. Oh, right. Make it some progress, but this is of course, is in Rome where they're on to that silly old dead man that they keep slump it around and a chair. He's been dead for months to poke. Nobody. But you might know it would be bad for business until they can blow some smoke. That's why he had a little select those 30 or 35 new right wing cardinals, you know? Yeah, I know. And the new one is a, uh, a greaser, as a matter of fact. The new one, if they're saying the most likely, we'd be new one, a right wing Italian. But in Rome, an Italian court earned their state school to strip all crucifixes from its classroom walls on the weekend after a Muslim activist, complained that his children should not have to study in its presence. The high court in La Quilla, in the southern abrutsu region, based its ruling on the 1984 Concorded, I just love to say abrutsu. I love that. Teregan. Abrutsu. Fabrizio. I don't know. Based it's ruling on a 1984 Concorded between Italy and the Vatican, that agreed Roman Catholicism could no longer be considered a state religion. The landmark decision is expected to deepen divisions between Roman Catholics and Muslims in Italy. And as a, here's the best part of this story is a bitter blow to the Vatican, and it's authority in the country. Oh, right. Oh, right. See their onroam. They've been onroam like I've told you this for years. 97% of people, Italy, don't go to church. They don't rub the rosary beads. They don't go there with all the jet keys in a Vatican. They don't want nothing to do with it. They're not worshiping no old man and a dress, and a soy after with a stupid beanie that even a jews are embarrassed by. The judges said the presence of the symbol of the cross leads to a grasp of the expression of religious faith, which is deeply wrong because it manifests the state's unequivocal desire to put the Catholic faith at the center of the universe as an absolute truth, with the least respect for other religions. Absolutely. The ruling was seen yesterday to buy political analysts as a blow to Sylvia Obrolusconi Center right government, which is campaigned to ensure that crucifix is premiering on classroom walls. Boy, you talk about the anti-Christ. Oh, did you see the story about, uh, I found the Pudry port? No. About Ronnie Reagan? No. Oh, my gosh. I got a during the breaker. I got a download that about how he was. He was not so what he was in a White House. It wasn't just afterward. Right. And he was crying and sobbing. He's the anti-Christ and history's going to record him as the anti-Christ? No, that was, uh, W. No, no. Seriously, no, W is going to be. Well, he's just another one. If you give him all a shave in a haircut, it's all the same numbers on a head. What are they doing? We're supposed to be in a five-season show. Do you weigh him? Do you drugs, Packing? I said down for dumb. What you gonna do? What you gonna do when they come for you? Oh, my God. Yeah. What you gonna do when they come for you? Oh, my God. Yeah, we're at a code 2318. We've got a jumper on the roof of the Mohammed savings alone building here. And I'm trying to talk him down right now. Everybody out of my way, I am going to jail. That's our copy. Give it a microphone. Sir, do you want to have to do this? Don't want to down. I'll talk to you, stay here. Excuse me, Lieutenant. We're able to try down the jumper's mother. And no? Oh, my God. See you, man. Here, look. Take this microphone. Okay. Can try talking some sense into this guy. Oh, God. Oh, God. Get me. What do you want to do? Yes, I can hear you. He can hear you. God. Oh, man. Did you say, sedun? Oh, yes. Yes, sedun. Yes. King of bipolar paving. Grandfather, no. What do you mean? Hugo, take a look at him. What do you want him to do? Oh, God. in this group. Tom Tom. Wow. Good. I never got to play the upshot. As far as my world's service tickets is concerned. Yeah. And about that whole business about eBay, which I never should have said that on the year, see come to find out that it's very, very illegal. Yeah. To be a scalp in your tickets on eBay or any place else. And Canada, it's not illegal as scalp tickets. Okay. Hey, stand right outside of your Canada Center and a scalp leaf tickets like left and right like to do on La Blas, but make believe garden. It's going to be a big gigantic supermarket with hockey bucks. You ready for that? Okay. But anyway, it's not illegal to scalp. Here I forgot about that. And so naturally, I had my friend put the thing on eBay. And one of our student listeners out there, I'm positive it had to be. I don't want to say which one. But nevertheless, oh, and I've contacted the local authorities. And above all, he's emailing everybody who's selling tickets on eBay. That it's against the law. You're all going to go to jail on the SNN. So why would you not know what's happening with those tickets? Do you? Do I? No. No. Good. Let's just leave it that way. Always got to be some people. See, in America, that's what America's all about. They want to put everybody in jail. It's just no matter what it's for Jay walking, scalp and tickets. You name it, picking your nose, pop it a bad roiid in public. Whatever they can put your ass in jail for, they'll do it. Because that's the American. If I'm way, especially now, that we got the, the, the, the, the stopo there. Watch, you know, and speaking of the party, we have a big party coming up. We wish we could invite the audience. Can we? We actually probably should. That would really piss Greg off big time. And if anybody deserves it. Oh, by the way, he's prominently, he's prominently discussed in that school and autobiography. One of the pink and one of the stink. Most of it is about Greg and the honest with you. You got the book yet? No. That's unrightened yet. Oh, yeah. Anyway, the summer ratings are in says this memo and power ninety six and WQ and both show significant gains in their target demos. Oh, right. Can we care about power ninety six? No. Not the least. We like can carry a lot. There's some people over there. We like or you like. I don't care. Yeah, but we don't really care about power ninety six because it's not for us. It's got nothing to do with us in addition, which we work on A M. So they most of them people that are looked down upon us. Oh, you're on A M. Well, you like that. That's just how they when you pass it into horror and the elevated. Because we're on A M. And we can relate to it because that's what our civil sounds like. Most of the time, right? Oh, yeah. So that's us. QM was number one over on Kozon. Here with all this about we did this. Neil and summer reliever George Rain first with a healthy eight point two share tend to do. Absolutely. Jim Madditch, ranked first with a 7.5 two to four. Absolutely. And we're going to do a number of goldburg ranked number one with a sporting. He was sporting a big one, the hopper a six point eight share of salute for the 7. And wait to hear this all together. Adominated men 25 to 54 summer book. Congratulations to Josh aka Clarence Duff. Doreen and the entire QM staff were job well done. Couldn't have done it without him. Now what the hell did Doreen do to have anything to do with those numbers? Oh, behind the scenes stuff. Yeah, she was doing stuff behind the scenes. I was trying to get a hold of it. Trying to sniff it. It was looking at how does that bitch kid in that fat disgusting bitch. Josh and Duff and Doreen. I mean, what is this? What? And you remember the employee of the month? How many years ago that ended the QM? How fast it ended? And you want to know why? Why? Because you went out of people who could take the pin. Seriously. If you were named the employee of the month, you had a choice to take in how much was it 50 bucks? 200 I think. Was it 200? Yeah, 200 or a QM pin. Well, naturally, and of course the deal was it wasn't ever written down, but everybody knew that if you ever took the money, you'd never get picked and played the month again. Except I broke the record. Right. And I used to give the money to your cost. All the time. Well, of course Greg doesn't like your cost. All the too much. So that's why. Plus it's too embarrassing. Always be in the medium. Play of the month every month. Every time the numbers come out. By the way, thanks to what's his name? Great Perry for a check for a band and pair rescue. Right. Am I right? I sure hope he gave it to you because you said, No, no, he sure. Good guy. How about the check? That tip. So thanks to Ray, we got Ray Perry and Mufflenzy who's busy gushing it up in Key West, the fantasy fact being a real professional. And who else? Correct. And we've been out. And Curtis. And that's it. Anybody else from inside to building? Give us a check. A dime. A penny. A dollar. A dollar. Adam. Adam. Other than that. Zippity. Do do. All these high paid colleagues of mine. It's not like we got some kind of charity that's like controversial abandoned Petrescu. I mean, anybody doesn't like dogs. I mean, cats. I can handle or a weasels. But dogs is something wrong with you. If you don't like dogs. Because to be very honest with you, I'd rather associate with dogs than many of you. Not all, but many. Trust me. Send a picture. But it's almost the end of October. And you people have been telling me, Oh, well, Ray's 100,000 is your easy. Right. Yeah, I guess if you're each going to put up like 30,000, you and Miguel, that keep telling me to scan Scott put in his 10 grand. I think we got to lift. There's a 100 right there. We already got 35 10 of which is mine. Pretty weak. Go online. George was starting to say before I interrupted him last hour. But you notice how, I'm like, this is just. Well, it's after a long vacation. It's only good. Is it really? It's all over the place. I like it that way. I like it all over the place, too. Believe me. Anyway, we have an of in celebration of our success, our ratings party for both power 96 and QM is taking place. Thursday, October 30th of a faith in and beverages will be served. The party will be held at in, uh, Pemberg Pines. Right. Staff only. So I can't tell you where it is. Cause otherwise, some of you people would show up and say, Hey, where's the free food? Where's the buffet? And where's the booze? That's have a double barrel party for the Marlins and QAM. And power 96. I'll be taking applications for instant interns. Send the picture to George at wqan.com. Oh, I'm waiting here this in order to give you sufficient time to prepare for the evening's festivities. Our office is more close at 4 p.m. This Thursday, October 30th. Well, isn't that nice? And any signs of Greg would at squiggle on there, which, uh, you know, is a glaring example of his deep seated inferiority complex? Well, it's not a complex as in his case. It's real. Anyway, here's the story. And I can't believe that Ms. Fudge, he must be busy with their boyfriends. It must be, oh, maybe Ms. Thrig is down in fantasy. We've got two, you're thinking, Keywatt? Well, it's because this story was on their last evening. And I don't, uh, let's see, uh, 2047 is what, 847, right? 847, PM last night. And it's still the same. There's no addition to it, but it's well worth reading. Explosive. One shocks in the final production script for CBS's upcoming tenth film The Reagans, captures the former president declaring he is the anti-Christ the Fudge Report can reveal. During Iran-Contra-Scanville, Reagan's breakfast room in a White House morning, Reagan and Nancy sit in front of their breakfast, they can't eat, can't drink their numb. Reagan, it's Armageddon, that's what it is, Armageddon, the leader from the West will be revealed as the anti-Christ and then God will strike him down, that's me, I am the anti-Christ, Nancy, no Ronnie, Reagan overwiting, and the Lord will strike on all civilization in order to make way for the new order, a new heaven and the new earth. Nancy reaches out grabs his hands strongly. Nancy, hold on, you've got a hold on Ronnie, Reagan's eyes are filling with tears, he can't help it, he's crumbling. Reagan, I saved 77 lives in 70 years Nancy, but I couldn't save those people in Lebanon. Nancy gets up, puts her arms around him, she rocks him slowly, silently back and forth. Former First Lady, Nancy, Reagan has reached out to Hollywood heavyweights, including Murve Griffin, that lady, to somehow stop the controversial movie, said for broadcast during when November sweeps, I'm going to watch that five times, how did it, maybe I watch it? Yeah, and by the DVD, oh my God, I'll buy the DVDs, I'll be able to meet some extra pair because I'll be crap in my pantaloonies watching that again. She had her psychic on one line, and he had his Bible in the other hand, and he was out before they would like put on at the shoe polish, to keep me black shoe polish, to grease him up. He was always standing in the mirror looking to see where the three sixes were, because he was the anti-Christ, and believe me, anti-neal knows the anti-Christ when he smells him. That is just special in it. I can't wait. Crazy people in a White House, and like I've told you, the crazy people are religious people, you'll find a part in Michael Moore's book which I loaned to a friend, I'll get another copy for tomorrow. I'll read it for a bit, because he says it's so much better than I ever could. But basically, he says the solution to the Middle East is whether I'm just blow each other up. But I'm all coming to you. Why not? How should we care about it? Just give enough weapons, so they can all kill each other and then let's go on with life. Because if that's what they want to do, hey, more power to them. Tubman dreared, more firepower to them. Right. Look at that poll, Jeffrey Loria. Look at that poll, Daniel Samson or whatever hell's name is David Delilah. Let's take on a new state-in-for-the-world champion, Marlon. Oh, come on, where's your community spirit, Neil? You're always peeing on our parade. I'm just telling you the way it is, okay? Some of you emotional cripples out there you can't handle the truth, like Jack Nichols and said. 275 votes, what's your take on the new state-in-for-the-Marlon's? None of my tax dollars gonna build on 131. 47.6%. Let's do what they deserve it, 75. I don't give a crap about it, 44. It was great, but good by Marlon's 25, a strong 9% its constitutes. You're at number stand the same for 9% say, hey, it was great, but we know we're gonna get screwed in the end. You're gonna start big and first-stating again. You're gonna try to fleece this again and buy a buy. By the way, speaking of fleecing, I do like that on NBC evening news. Because on the England, 1130 at night, which is like, is it 1130? Well, that's 1030, Brit time, because they're like an hour behind a rest of your feel, like everything else, they're way behind civilisation. Take care of the NBC news on BBC and on Sky at 2 hours later, 1 30 more in the carried Dan Rathah. I get Dan Rathah, 1 30 in the morning, as Al Golzzi and your close friend used to say. And I was seeing the thing on the fleecing of America, I do like that. You see that the government spent $33 million to promote the new $20 bill? You see that? I didn't. They spent $33 million to educate the public about the new pink and black and the PUSE $20 bill. Yeah, it's very gay too. Yeah, it is very gay. Meanwhile, $87 billion that the president wants to stick over there and interact and try to put the pieces together. I love the way that they keep running around and say, oh, well, we're getting them electricity and rebuilding the hospitals. Yeah, it's like if I come to your house and I blow it up, but I say, oh, hey, look at this. Now I'm going to go out and bake for money so I can put it back together again. Thank you. Why? How do you like that? Here's a bag of nails. The 87 billion, in the meantime, we got all these people out of work. We've got the hospitals in America that are worth a crap. We have schools with no textbooks. That's another thing that really frosted my ass. Remember we had the little Joey Conan as wife as a school teacher. A couple of years ago, and kids in date County didn't have textbooks to take home because the schools didn't have enough textbooks to go around for every student. And in the meantime, oh, we got the supply textbooks for the kids interact. Well, screw the kids in Iraq is what I say. Okay, we are. When they hello, we ever going to start taking care of Americans is what I'd like to know. That's right. I have no dish TV. That's right. Let's get this TV for Scott is what I say. Let's get some free tickets for the Marlins for next season. So we actually put some asses in the seats of war. Look so embarrassing. Let's take part in that 87 billion and build a nice new stadium at Don stadium for the Marlins that are facing the damp taxpayers this out for again. Here are the place to shreds. Every day now we got kids dying in a public is sitting, I went, or they got a one of the, I know they had a couple of protests over the weekend, big deal. When is the public in the media going to finally get together and start saying, it's time for impeachment, baby. We're not talking about a couple of blow jobs. We're not talking about the devil with a blue dress on her, a stain on her dress. We're talking about impeachment, man. And of course the big push now is, oh, it's the George tenant in the CIA. There are at a one to give us the bad intelligence and you want to know why? Because we're the George tenant come from. He was the holdover from the Clinton years. Oh. So it's real going to be real easy. They're going to like nail him to the cross, speaking of a crucifixion. They're going to nail the CIA to the cross. And then the meantime, everybody knows even Jay Rockefeller was spot the yesterday on one of them talking. It shows that hey, they planned this all ahead of time. And you're even starting to wonder about that one passage there from Nick Pack about, it would take some gigantic, head of clismic event to be able to pull this off to go into a rack. Like that, Nick Pack. Meaning 9, 11, P.N. Whatever to hold. What I call it, Nick Pack. I mean something else. It's all like Nick Pack better. Nick Pack. I have a 15 at five, 60. I like my backpack. It's actually when the matcho shrooms are and the furniture is still not this copy can't possibly be right, can it? No, this copy's old. It's ancient. It's like all are other copy. The sales department of WQM, they're the anti-Christ Ronnie. Don't worry about it. They're the anti-Christ they suck. Anyway, if you want a great deal on a name brand, Mattress, all you got to do is make one easy call to my friends at Dalama, Chris 365 days a year.

Let's do what they deserve it. 94 people 28.5% say, here, let me empty my wallet, okay? I don't give a crap about it. 53. And it was great, but goodbye Marlins. 27. That's not a 0.2% thank goodness for that. It's dropping now. Oh and guess what else happened while I was gone? I give up. The big story about your friends at Walmart and all the you leave. Oh yeah. We had a couple on them. Let's hear it. All right. Legal aliens at Walmart. Oh, right. The anti-Christ. Right there Walmart. Anybody who helps at Walmart? We don't like you very much. What? Telling you for years. You're right. I don't shop there. Evil. Ooh, evil, do we? We're shemby evil, do we? We're shemby evil, do we? We're shemby evil, do we? We're shemby evil, do we? We're shemby evil, do we? Now let's get these phones hopped up here. Although we do have that OJ story from the inquiry, which I'm a little bit disappointed in the inquiry. Because the headline, this is from like before I went away. I didn't have time for all of that. And let me also say one other thing. Have you noticed how very rapidly somebody some story has like vanished? I mean I've been out of the country. I grant you a pretend to. But you know, I got the internet. I got the CVC and BBC and the PPC and PBC. The Nick PAC and PNAC and all of that other stuff. It wears the beef. Am I right? Yeah. What's the story? I think he's drying out with the Jeb's daughter? Because I understand she knows where to get the pretty good stuff. Not one more worried about Rush and boy, you talk about numbers. Man you talk about mumbling down. Oh. five weeks you should hold your breath it's been about five weeks for him to come back. But anyway we got the Robert Kardashian died as you know who was OJ's good buddy in the first attorney. Really dumped him. Got that story got Dr. Phil is a fraud. I love that story. Anything bad about Dr. Phil people that we despise people are total phones and making millions as a result of it. So I got tomorrow's poll already about the companies I'm not going to do it right now. See if I tell them not then they'll start calling with that. I don't want to interfere with all the tremendous of volume of calls we're getting about the marlins and the world series victory. You see that? Here's one from four lauderdale right now. Hello. Four lauderdale. We love that there's not a call on. Well now there's one. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line at noon. Eric will change the poll. We'll go to poll number two. Which will be? Here's the question. Because we want to put the Io emphasize the state image. Do we even though we do know that the community will be pressured and blackmailed again. Hey if you want us to keep all these players man, see we already went through that one time. What was called a macarina? Well if you want to keep the panthers you're going to have to build a civic arena and power it in the adi adi adi adi adi and all another crap. And then we'll spend the money. We'll have a winner or keep this great thing. And of course they they seize the pun that one big year when a panthers got hot for two months. They really have such a great season. They got hot for two months. I'm going to tell you something right now and you can mark it down. Okay. If Broward County would change their mind and decide they want to build this facility, I will not play here. Because I will not have you guys looking at me for the next 10 years saying here's the guy that said one thing and went out and did something else. And now what do we go? We had another white elephant. We just had to stir a couple of weeks ago about how the fact it was Michael Holda Mayo that wrote that stir in the scum sent about how Broward isn't getting 50 sent from the macarina there that the Wayne is fleece and all the money again and all the concessionaires and wherever else. So you know it's just a question. If you want to ask yourself, you want to go down that road again or you really care about it really that much. You know what I'm saying? So far they don't. So far, it's only about a little bit less than a hundred man. We're sent who are still wound up with that you if you're in probably a little bit plastered. Come on, the big parties over the weekend. The celebrations to big parades. Hey, we love the. Yeah. Same damn people. Let me say it again. And I noticed that Kelly this morning line again, 17,000. They did not average 17,000 a game. The average just a little over 16,000 a game. And if you took away the last month from that, it would be like more 11 and 12,000. When I had those gigantic crowds of an affer running phonyism started and all those people started showing up because they could smell, oh yeah, we want to be on his vanwagon. 27 passed 11 at 5, 60 WQN big news.

Did I just get through saying little while ago and several times during the show today that we had the scenes all the all the Hands of being greased the palms of being greased all the wheels are turned in behind the scenes and no matter what the tax Preset of public think it'll find a way It says there will be a there will be a public vote in date County concerning a new ballpark during the 2000 four-lash money know what let me say it again.

We've been sufficiently warned that we better knock a lender and say all of the right things now I say the chases are 100% what do you think? I think then nobody else is gonna be stupid enough to take right in In addition to which I don't even know when a Marlins contract is up Oh, and and nobody cares the fact that we're playing those promos on there now Pat and ourselves on the back all of the games were brought here on a flood the flagship station and playing highlights from Dave and boring Even even Jim Sarny who you is as boring as vanilla putting even he I noticed so a few days ago to the shot I think was last week in a Friday column and Made a comment about the great call by boob shambi and a game laying home on by elephants allus what the they was that there was game five Yeah, you know the 11th inning home run and Alice Gonzalez to win a game Well anyway whatever day it was and Sarny was oh it was a wonderful call can you imagine the The call if would have been the vanilla or whatever adjective he used the vanilla calls of Dave and boring's up up in a way Yeah, good points Sarny it's about time he said something Playing highlights by Dave and boring this man is so coma inducing so terminal It's the disgrace they should have just tossed him off to the side. Pay them off to go away and let boob's through do the whole game during the playoffs And the serious am I right about that? Yeah, everybody knows that even George knows that what about boob's there. Oh, yeah boob's then outstanding broadcaster I'll call the right and pick about See I get accused of being misdemeid negative, but just like this facts this is the tone of it you people in Dave County You voted for the metro rail to how's that coming huh? Oh that's looking really good I mean it can snicker you one way or the other all I got to do is give free passes out to the cockfight So that's about all the takes and Dave County Put it how do you people shouldn't huh all the palms are being greased and all the right places Which is why we'll be on a ballot and by the way if it is on a ballot the verdict will be no If that's the only way that they think they're gonna put it over and to put it to a public referendum it ain't gonna pass There are two chances none and much much much less than none you can bet your life on edge M Oh guess what you in that must have been all right. He's off today. See he's on right in taxes And dogs off today. We got Joe Rosa too Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha How is chuckle when Joe is on you wonder why? Why is that? Because I know that during part of his show He's gonna talk about our Fumoka Yeah you're gonna see take a shot The hopper'll be on between four and five another tough assignment for hang today because we got a Dolphin game so we are so sports intensive now it's nauseating Five o'clock we start to four hours of pre game and sanity so we can cram in not 45 about 55 minutes esports echaror for Andrew who's upset that we played too many spots. Dolphins count out a kick off at five and then kick off at nine. The dolphins at the, another girl's team, San Diego charges. What kind of a schedule is this they got this year, huh? Uh, there was a change. I just got a call. What is it? Joe Rose from 2 to 5 today. Oh, how about that? Joe Rose 2 to 5, not 2 to 4 because they're not going to have the Humper come in for one hour. Or guy of his, uh, statue inside. Don't come modeling in for one stinking hour. So 2 to 5, you get three hours of joy. Should have plenty of chance to talk about more of my right. That's a good shirt. To rip him in ice. I'm going to, we love you, baby. So Joe Rose, you get three hours of the little dog and then you got to count on the kick off. Dolphins at the charges at nine is they play another weak sisters of the blind. Dolphin point after 11. So we have two hours of post-given in Joe Mark 1, go 5 and AM because they're not going to bring in any K for one hour either, huh? No. So that's the schedule. Congratulations, and Joe and Mark did not tell you that that show there's was really kicking ass that tell you that every day. A 7 point, uh, something. What do they have overnight? 7.7. Whatever was they had a big number in there. One to 5 AM 7 points. And I think they had a 7 for or something. Whatever was there's a big number in there was a real strong QAM book in man, every element in town where listen to what's including the ones, they're sending these facts. Is, oh, you say this and you said, if you're listening to me in time, this guy's going back years ago. So here you have this guy sent me facts about stuff I said, how many years ago? I've heard of man. Yeah. And he's still listening. That's what counts. Okay, because we're still kicking ass. We're still number one. We're still breaking into bucks with or without them, Arlen's. But you know what, it reminds me of what? It reminds me of that business with Donna Shalila and that crap with the billboards about we've got balls, you know? And again, it was all stirred up by the same one, uh, agitated out there, the Ojo on Provocator. Oh, well, you'll see the hurricanes are going to resound with QAM because they're going to be pissed off of these things that you say, and you'll live out to her, a cooons, it about those billboards, and guess what? What station did they resign with? WQAM, okay? Am I right? You are. Absolutely correct. Got my thumb right on it now. You were right, 740. Yeah, 740. Hey, I don't mess with me on those numbers, man. I mean, not no much else. I like Ronnie. I know three numbers. 666. What's your take? Here's the last chat. No, well, change the pool. Because we don't want to get JM upset. What's your take on a new stadium for the World Champion Marlins, 43 votes in, uh, hour and a half? That's pretty heavy duty, George. None of my tax dollars have built it. 2146.4% anyone in a while can vote for that because I live in Broward, not in date, but in Broward. I mean, we're a stupid and Broward, but not that stupid. No. Let's do what they deserve at 130. You know what percent that is? About 30 minutes. Exactly 30%. Right on the money. Nice going. I don't give a crap about it. 64. And it was great, but good by Marlins, 38.7% say enough already. Well, look at this. A new copy. Look at that from fat boy. You are such a. I'm telling you, this sells department. They need to be in prison. There are people on death row for lesser crimes than they've committed to our fine clients, or spending their hard and money trying to get some response. Oh, look at this. Survey shows big support for rush. In a survey of rush, Limbaus audience conducted for critical mass media by breaking corporate. More than nine out of ten, Listen, who said that news of Limbaus drug dependency had not diminished their regard for them. Haha. Keep reading. Indeed, 22% of those questions said they had gained respect for rush because of the way his handling is problems are only 8% to the headless. And over well. Oh, here comes the best part. As Senator John McCain might say, critical mass media like the NAB is a wholly unsubcitiary of clear channel communications, which also just happens to syndicate rush by its premier radio network. Okay. Yeah. So that is kind of sounds to me like the flora election. Like maybe a little bit. Suspect. Suspect. As in that in 30 cents. Well, I about a half a cup. Coffee at Starbucks.

What does it mean carry a carry columns? Yeah. Cry baby. Cry is a lot of the resume. Our operations manager of mufflands. He cries a lot. Although I don't think he spends any time in key west. mufflands. If anybody's looking for muff is in the key west of fantasy. Fath. He's having a gay time. Good luck. This. It's a wonderful time. Every time you play that. Good luck. This. Because he takes his vitamins. 5, 6, 7, 5, 60. Come on. Let's hear it for those marlins. What a ungrateful bunch of bastards, man. And to have it, I did not say older and a playoff. That it was good for the community. That I was glad, even though I wasn't going to be a front-referring fan. Fony. That at least I thought it was something positive and other, and other ways. And otherwise, bashed in bad, in negativity. Now what I said. Yep. Sure. I did. But I just don't want to be fony enough to say, hey, let's get done home now. Let's run a campaign to get to stay in because that's full crap. It's ridiculous. It's absolutely ludicrous and it's unacceptable. But there's the new pool. Let's see. How much did the world series? What am I going to vote on here? No, a bit. I watched Summer All of a Gain. I was like, a little tiny couple of pitches here. And then in there. So I'll be generous. I'll vote for that one a bit. I watched Summer All of a Gain. That's what I did. Didn't make me into a real fan. I was having it. On at one night I saw some of the fan used to me. Why did you voice your time? So did you write it? Yeah, right. Do you write it? No, too. W to Q AM. Hi. I wanted to play the order for the lyrics. You want to say one? Hello. What is it? Oh, man. What a ball of fire. It's self-floor to bathe. The town is on fire. Everybody thinks it's California. That's on fire. It's self-floor to their flaming man. You can hear it. He's called the enthusiasm. The excitement. It's beyond belief. All of a get our bunches are cancels. It's like a fact. It's a hostility because it's a... That's our Florida for you. Well, look at there. Blowin' a lot of smoke out there and say the ego. State of destruction. Maybe there's a lot of work to mysterious ways. Just like Pat Robertson said, he's got the whole state on fire now because of Arnold the therminator. He's going to terminate California. Man. Talk about crispy critters. That's a here's one. Dear Kermudgeon. During your brief vacation, George and Sudge did a brilliant job of keeping a little stimulated and entertained. Now we're in the midst of a two-day celebration here in our beloved South Florida because of our Marlins' wonderful victory over these soulless Yankees. Is it too much to ask you, show a little joy for us? We have so little to be happy for you down here in our third world situation. Why do you pass going to resort town of Toronto? Oh, this is a resort town. That's a good one. We each got our mega resistance here. So, as expressed joy for our baseball team, a phony facts here. Our fonts were my husband. It's only till tomorrow that we can forget the existence till next summer providing their winning. So, at least you got back to honesty down the end. As long as they're winning, then everybody, a few people stay on a bandwagon. If by some chance they wind up not being able to, you know, resound a lot of these high-priced players like Pudge, Fudge, Mr. Rudge. Well, and then if the team should go on a shmit house, then all of a sudden they'll hop off the bandwagon just like they have over and over again. The excuse being, oh, they broke up the team. They did this so they lost a couple of games. I mean, it's ridiculous. I'll tell you about what's ridiculous. Yeah, I should have asked, don't let me forget to ask for well-democracy broadcast to thrangest your games for what one season I think. Yeah. Now, you know that they're off to this tremendous start and spite of the business with heat-lead and dance night again and kill. But they're off to a phenomenal start. In fact, they finally lost their first game to the Panthers no less three to the other night. Now, I watched a little bit of that game Saturday with the rimman, and I'm going to tell you something. There was nobody there. The box was that it was 16,000 people there. I think they had the 16 part, right? But not the thousand. And it was nobody. You talk about a horseball sports thumb and Atlanta is one of the worst. The brave don't even sell out the playoff games because, wow, we know they're going to choke. What is that? That is one of the worst-freak in sports-down. So even though the thrashers got a really exciting young team and after a really good start, there is nobody at those games there. That was, did you see any of it? Yes, I did. And am I right? You are correct sir. There was, I mean, it was frightening. If there was 5,000 people there, that was a lot. Maybe they counted them each three and a half times. We had about 12,000 for the wild game. Yeah. We won a medal. We won a medal. We won a medal. We won a medal. We won a medal. We won a medal. What do you mean it was a pretty full house? This place eats 19,000, 12,000 to full house now? How many of those were paid tickets? How many were actually paid to get in? About 30, man. If that. Okay, here's the early result on our, this is the important pool. The other one. They'll slide it through. You'll see. Just like they did the arena and Broward. 33 votes. How much did the World Series wins by tomorrow's impact? You're interested on the team. A bit. I watched them all at the game 16. Tons. I'm a real fan now. Six. We believe it. Not at all. I still don't give a Schmidt about him. Six. And some. But I've been a fan all along. Five. There you go. That's the, ladle. Five six, seven, five, 60.

Rodriguez Gonzalez Martinez in the, sounds like a guy named Mafia, Buncha Mafia Cuban Hitman. He's what it sounds like. They are. It's all like the scene from Scarface. WQAM. Hey, are you doing pretty good? Okay. Does he all sounds like me? I do a heal. Let me say it again. Pretty good. Great. Two things. On the people who are saying bad things about the Marlins and not getting stadiums, all this country and the bankions fans. Yeah. And second go, Jan. Go out and come home. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Five six, seven, five, 60. Pound five, 60. Amanda, it's talk about the game that couldn't shoot straight. I don't know.

We will. Oh, yeah. We got no memories. We got to cut the check. We guys don't have any deadline. We got until whatever till we feel like we got enough. I'm still waiting for those tests to come pouring in for my colleagues. There. I'm going to go to the market and pay rescue. How about a check from Greg? That would be nice. And then in response to that great book that we just gave them. That was surely be nice. Here's a guy that's got more money than God more money than the boot. Maybe he's just all part together. Why?

Yeah. I mean, you could see him just like gripped off. And then when you knew that he didn't have much left because when he said that he didn't fall down, he meant to get to the whole thing without falling down.

He wants to know. Yeah. Yes sir. Yeah. I just want to mention a pectoring game for five of the series when they had the rain delay. Right. Well, after they started playing again, and you're looking to stand and you're going to be there when they all go. Where did they all go? Yeah. We're going to say that's crap at a lie. You're going to see you for a crap. Well, what kind of this Miguel known? A lot of people did go, but they didn't leave. They just went underneath to get to give me shelter. It weren't a plane. Give me shelter on the PA. Yeah. See, honest negativity. I don't know when it gets accused all the time. Well, how come you can't be more enthusiastic and healthy though? The pie pie for the big parade in the meantime. I'm not hearing any enthusiasm. I'm hearing any excitement. I heard like something good just finally happened in the middle of that cesspool. All I'm hearing is all this negativity. Just a hostile, as usual. So nothing has changed. I could totally be for the show. I wouldn't have missed. You said nothing. We've seen. It's in a little crap. There you go. Oh, it's just like party time. That sounds like a few ending parties. It's going to be held at noon in the pebble finds. That's right. Right out here in the street. Yeah, it's right out there. Yeah. Now out in the street, that's where a screen is servicing all the clientele. Twenty. Twenty cents by the way. Twenty cents a pop. I. Five six seven. Five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T. And for why is it more or less line? It only person line one and see what it looks like. Look at that. It doesn't even do anything. A state. Well, what what happens when you press it. No, seriously. It's nothing. It's a no. It's a deed. Oh, my god. It sounds like another engineering debacle. Oh, my god. I got a few. I got a few. I think that guy Andrew had a point. WCWM. Hello. Hello. Pretty good. Is it Neil? Sounds like Neil. Hey, Neil. I'm going to have to train him from Windsor. And I've been down there two years. Not him. Sick of tired. It is baseball. Talk to talk to what a real story. Talk to the Maple Leaf. Would you please? Okay. Time tired of these fans. I know they went to championships in seven years. We don't want to have a shift to seven. I'm 35. I've never seen a lease raise a cup. But I've been to about 100 games. And every game of adventure was sold out. This town has no passion. So why are we talking to a sport that don't care about? Exactly. Well, I love talking to that. Well, he just ended that call real fast. If you think baseball don't have any fans in South Florida, hockey. I mean, you're talking. I'm not a sport in language. You're talking to a different planet. Okay. The community is in one place in, you're on Uranus. Forget about that. Hockey. Like I said, like a four language in South Florida. I mean, I have no, there are certain teams in the NHL. I have no business being existing. One of them is the Panthers. A lot of Mr Buffalo Savers. Others, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the other ones. The Atlanta thrashes as well as they are because nobody shows up. Those teams, uh, they're no reason from to exist. Do I mention anyone that I was wrong about? They got the Calgary flames. Calgary flames. But it's Canadian. They got to like, you know, it's an ego thing. They keep hanging on hanging on. They know they're not going to make the playoffs. They're not going to contend. But they got to hang on because it's Canadian. They already lost cool back in Winnipeg. At the end of the world. And they did a lot of Vancouver was like on shaky ice too for a little bit. Calgary came from Atlanta. That's right. These to be the Atlanta flames. Then they were the Calgary flames. And other the Calgary on a way out of business flames. Well, that's what people wanted. They wanted parody. They won. That's what they got. Media. Crack. I got the NFL package on flipping yesterday. I mean, the Patriot game puts you into a coma to pay prison of Browns. And it would be exceptionally maybe two or three games, which were the, the, the Steve is in the other Rams. Right. That was a good game. Yeah. That was a shoot. What else was a good game? There was a two or three others. The Seattle gut bushwack there at the end. Who the hell did they play this? You know, any. So by the bangles of all people, right? How about that? Took it right up the old. But oh, it's so pleasing for me to watch even though the Patriot didn't play well. It was a terminal game to watch bush dive as they were in a sideline. You talk about a drooling redneck man. Much dive as the UN factor right on the. The rapper. I was going butch you suck. Twenty seven past noon at five 60 and you know, how good Seattle is after Dennis. So what's his name? Then he's going to be another beer. That's the Harrison. Will he Ferrison remember that? Yeah.

If you say something. They got a hockey team? No. Basketball team. Basketball team Scott. And you still have one? They got one now. NBA? No, they don't. No. And the chargers and the pod raise, they're interchangeable if you ask me. They're like two stiffs. I mean 84 set of pod raise one and they went to the world series. And that's it. Big deal. They went 98. I think they're a crock. Shinnes said that Joe crock just died. Ray Crock's wife just died. Here's a fashion Alex who says, hey, he's our, we blessed here in South Florida. We have their hurricanes kicking ass. Dolphins are competing for a playoffs spot and play a girls team tonight. The Marlins won the world series. And finally we have Moe Howard David in the, we what? We have Moe Howard David in the morning. We're truly blessed. Thanks, you know, you're right. Alex, we're blessed in South Florida. I'm so glad not to. I'm so glad to be a part of it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. So see, let me do the Robert Cardanshi in story. Okay, from the, the couple of good stories. And I'm glad that I left this laying around here. Otherwise, have a Schmidt candidate. This was the car that had the follow up on Rush. Remember that we had certain people out of one of my channel names in the building. Forward denying. Oh, that's an inquired. That couldn't possibly be right. All that business about Rush doing drug. Remember that? Not that. But I converted to a real. He's an inquired of the cycle. Now, I'd probably subscribe to it. Probably paying for it. OJ Simpson and I see I take exception. I want to make sure I separate myself from this first paragraph. I don't like the way the inquired handled his story. The first paragraph is especially. OJ Simpson, increasingly confessed to his lawyer and former best friend Robert Cardanshian, that he brutally murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman, the inquired has learned exclusively, which I would say. No. No. I mean, you can interpret that from the rest of the story, which I will pass along, but that's, that's how what he said. Did I do a good disfamed there? I think. Yeah. That's the blockbuster secret cardanshian nearly took to his grave when he died at age 59s of 10 or 30th, eight weeks after being diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. Sources say OJ made the shocking admission after the inquired track down and published a bombshell photograph of the fallen football hero wearing a pair of Bruno Molly shoes that matched Prince thought of the crime scene. Those ugly ass shoes? So, what get to that? It says ugly ass in here. OJ at Tull Cardanshian never owned a pair of the ugly ass shoes after the photo surface to learn demanded that his friend tell him the truth. OJ laughed and told him, I don't all know shoes anymore. Got that? Got it? I don't all those shoes anymore. According to the source, Kardashian was floored. It was like someone had punched him in the gut. He had been a patty for OJ, he realized OJ had been lying in for years from that moment on the two men were no longer friends, dammit. Kardashian, who met some citizen in 1960, had been the former NFL star, Starchist, defended in the days right after Nicole and Goldman murders on June 12, and on June 12, 1994, Kardashian had been on the phone with AC colleagues during OJ's freeway chase in the white grunko. He read OJ's bizarre suicide letter on TV before his arrest, and he took OJ's luggage out of the rocking amistate when a Simpson returned from Chicago, implicating himself as a possible accomplice in the murders. OJ called him the best friend to go I could ever have. But, but that changed in 1996 after the inquiring cover the photo of Simpson wearing Bruno Molly's at Buflo Bills game, the rare shoes were the Lorenzo model where I wonder if that's Rodler-Renzo. The Lorenzo model, or maybe Lorenzo Llamis, you think? Maybe. With distinct silka souls, the same soul pattern left in bloody tracksure on Nicole Brown's body outside her Brentwood apartment, sounds like another one of those strange unfortunate coincidences for OJ if he acts me. The evidence led to OJ being found livel for the deaths in the 1997 civil trial. Bob went to OJ with a photo and demanded so I thought you never owned a pair of these shoes. OJ said he tried to brush off Kardashian with a lamp, but it only made Bob angry. Finally, OJ blurted out. I don't own those shoes anymore. Alright Bob, you satisfied? You get it? I don't have them anymore, so when I said I don't, I didn't own those ugly ass shoes. I meant it. I don't have them anymore. OJ said Bob was stunned and it was clear that he finally believed that OJ did it and came as close as he ever would to actually confessing the murders. I see a lady you're sinking in and you're shoes. You're soaking in it like the blood soaking into a shoe. Seriously, take that paragraph and then think back to the first one. So you see that they really, the first paragraph was misleading in terms of what he actually said, but he might as well have said it, you know? Right. While Kardashian never publicly revealed OJ's confession. He did tell Barbara Walters in the 96 interview that he doubted his former friends in a sense. When Kardashian died last month, OJ was in Shreepport, Louisiana with girlfriend Christie Prode, he barely reacted to those. The source said, OJ just said, it's too bad he was once my friend. Kardashians passing came to six weeks after marrying girlfriend Ellen Pearson, his previous wife, Chris later married Olympic, the Catalan champ, Bruce Jenner, you know who she is. Yet she and Kardashians for children were with him and as in Cino California, home when he died. His death was shocking a pal told the inquirer over the summary of taking a vacation in Italy and falling love again with lovely Ellen and Ellie Mortgagebroker and he had a very successful business creating songs that play before films and movie theaters. Nicole Sister Denise Brown expressed her sympathy in an exclusive interview and choir interview, but she said it was too bad that he hadn't come forward. While I feel sorry for Kardashians, kids who've lost their father Robert never came out and said that OJ was guilty of murdering my sister in my Goldman. She said, I guess it's better late than ever, but I wish Bob would have questioned OJ's innocence during the trial instead of after he was acquitted. She said, I hope that Johnny Cochlan and Robert Shapiro in the rest of the dream team will eventually come around to publicly speak the truth that I'm not holding my breath. Everybody in hell right now. Okay. So there's the deal with OJ and Denise and it just never goes away. That's one thing that will never die until he does. Especially in South Florida. Another black mark in Cinear, there you have to go again. And being on our parade, we have it as big parade for the Marlins. They want a world-serious. They beat the hated Yankees in George Steinbrenner. That Jew bastard from New York, even though he ain't.

Have you heard of it? Are they going to do something at Joe Robby? Like they did in 97? They're going to do something like what? Like that. They had a party in 97 about 80,000 people showed up at Joe Robby. Yeah. Have you heard of it? They're going to do that this year. It's just come out of this. No. Now we're just going to forget about it. And we're going to go on to important stuff. We loved them, Marlins. They're just up there. Against the Yankees. They passed the test. And out at it. Yeah. Huh? Come on. Let's see what you're saying. What was your name? That did that Panthers song? No, look. What was it? Joel in. Oh, yeah. Good old Joel in. And then she got smart. He left town. Hello, not too smart because she went to Nashville. Yeah. He, although she probably fit in pretty good. Up there means she was a nice person, but she was kind of like always had one finger in her nose. She was picking an agreement. I want this back. So, all chronic. Why do you send me these? Chronic. Over the weekend, I twice tuned into the radio station. There and got Josh Dero both times. Clarence. Who's programming decision is there? Well, probably his because he's like a D. He's a god awful show host. Well, we're certainly going to agree with on that. I was crying after an hour of that torture. Well, so, see, this is what kills me. Somebody is on it. You don't like, why are you listening? It's like you people right now don't can't stand me. Why are you listening? Crystal set radio. At least give me Joe Rose or the big. Oh, on a weekend while when they're asking for the big. What Joe Rose, I could understand. But when I want to hear the big. I'd rather hear Clarence myself, at least, you know. I mean, the big. Oh, he's just a pretender. He's a pretender. He doesn't have a clue what he's talking about. And he speaks with that Spanish baby talk man. He has no business being on a year. He is one good looking guy. No, I know Joe's got a thing for him. A little thing. By the way, the picture sector of your website could use a little update there. No more beauty in our best. Bees please. What does that mean? We got beauty in the beast pictures. Are there still? What is with the beast? Is matter, fact. Where's he this morning? I don't know. Okay. Is he somewhere like traveling with the hurricanes to some like. Leopard colonies for the next the big game. I don't know where was the beast. I heard big fat Zach. Well, at least they had something fed you on here. They couldn't have the beast. So for all of stuck with Zach. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 were. The input here is just phenomenal man. I just am waiting for a little something little enthusiasm. A little excitement. The team. I'm sure that the people connected with the team are probably depressed and morose now. This is the kind of response that they get from the South Florida audience. From their sports station, from their flagship station. W. K. and Marlon celebration line. Hello. Q. A. M. That was Wayne. W. K. and hello. Yeah. Hi. I was trying to get the whole meal. Speaking. How you doing? This is, I wanted to make a couple of comments. Number one, I wanted to thank the management of the Marlon. I wanted to make a couple of comments. I wanted to make a couple of comments. I wanted to make another comment as far as the stadium. I thought we would do the stadium down here. So we don't have to play second-fiddle to the golfing. As far as time, even on your radio station. You cover the dolphins. And the marlon. But you get preference to the dolphins. Well, that's in the contract. Exactly. But that's in my space. We make a lot of money on the dolphins. I don't know if we even break even on the marlon's. Right. That's my point. I think that they need to have maybe even their own radio station. I mean, you know, marlon's radio. That sounds like a winning domain. But the problem with that is we wouldn't have any of those early days off on this show. If we did that. Right. He just vanished. You just went up and up. Huh? That's a big one. We like those days when we get off at 12, 30 or one o'clock or whatever. You know, a little extra time off. That always sounds good to me. All right. You bet those afternoon's when they have the big games. Mad dogs got the whole day off. Oh, right. Comfort comes in maybe for an hour. Maybe not at all. What do I know? What I'm saying? It's right. Too bad we're not on noon to four. We're going to be on when every tomorrow's are playing day games. Rest of the time we're just taking the day off. Sounds like a real winner to me. Maybe this is just get their own radio station. See now. Now, if the enthusiasm is so intense. It's like, well, you know, Q amp was okay for a while. It was adequate. And now it's so big and so important that you guys, uh, small pith is we're going to build our own radio station. And our own stadium and our own goddamn city. And we're going to have like all the ships at sea and everybody in the world is going to be like Marlon intensive. Does anybody believe any of them? No, of course not. They're going to like come coming with their hand out again. Just like John Henry did and just like Wayne did for the Broward Arena. And now all these people with all their millions and billions of dollars. Oh, please, please. Like what we did for you. Please build us a big dome facility. And then if the team should suck and go soft right away, uh, everybody will vanish again. Like they do every scene, just like Jacob is feeling Cleveland. Everyone of man, the Susan team starts going in the cramper. Everybody vanishes and all that enthusiasm excitement. Like the guy said before to call him line nine, could be paying for some textbooks with that public money. But in America, nobody gives a crap about educating their kids because they're afraid their kids will be smarter than they are. That's the problem. That is the problem. Everybody talks are really good game. But here's another, these facts are just unbelievable. We were waiting off on your assessment of the bullet train ball. Keep the kick, but I said it is a long getting great amusement. You were wrong. You made it a mistake. 114 by the way, by paycheck just to show it up what they said today like over the weekend. I just mentioned that in passing for all these negative people out there. You know, money gave you a little stuff. Don't interest me at all. Look at that. You're going to go to the parade. Still at the south Florida parties. Did you see that on CNN for about two seconds there? Wow, holy Toledo is Rick Weaver would say. That's what we need. Let's take a hold of Rick Weaver and bring him back to MC the celebration. Right, Alex. Hey, when you see McRezder is advertising a 50% sale off. Is it a trick and treat? Have they inflated the regular price to you a false impression of savings? Do they just have one piece to sell it to sale price? Then it's gone and then try to sell your full price set. The McRezder industry is full of phony claims in shell games. That's why I only call dial a McRezder 1 800 mattress. You ought to be doing the same. No false promises. No bait and switch.

We��ル and the Kraining family to heat up. It's a little eight year old Jimmy Archer against his grandma. Little Jimmy's playing this one beautifully. I must say he is down to one card and, oh, hold on. Oh, he forgot to yell. Oh, no. I'm going to be on four. Oh, no, you're not. He's not. He's not. He's not. He's not. He's not. He's not. Well, you know what that means. He's got to draw two cards. Now when that puts grandma firmly back to the driver's seat, yeah, too bad. That's a rookie mistake. And that's just going to hurt him. It sure is. And what is your name? Oh, oh, no. He's throwing a tantrum and running upstairs. Oh, no. As you know, that's an automatic disqualification. Well, I'll try. Jimmy really needs to work on his Uno phase. Give him time. Give him time. You're right. He's young. And we'll be seeing more of him. I'm sure. So congratulations to our new world series of Uno champion. Grandma. Oh, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh, no. Well, that's all for now. We'll see you next week when we bring you the world series of go fish live from the Caesar's palace. Take care, set it. Oh, right. One point of your five six. He WQM. That's so perfect. You know, it fits right in like a globe. So when we have this follow up facts from the chronic facts, who have been asked before about the bullet train, is it who that gives a flying crap about the bullet train anyway? Says my gosh, don't these two sensitive truth be told you were way off on your assessment of the bullet train vote and a half sense sales tax vote, same with the new ballpark. There's a great story today. Some similar on your website about today being the day that we choose a contractor and the route you think we should use jet engines of electricity should be up and running by 2011 a real bullet train. Uh-huh. This guy, what time is his show on? Right after years. Luckily it ain't on this station. This QM and here's the best part. Does WQM really believe they can make the marlins a better offer than clear channel. David Ross is what? It is and what is that? Heard before about the threat. Oh, you guy now that they want to world series, you guys can't have the marlins anymore. Now they're really big. Not just the threats but boy, they in touch with clear channel and the powers that be or what? Yeah, like all the money clear channels making on the Miami heat. Oh my god, that's a real where for them and all those big ratings. Anyways, David Ross is moving in for the kill. Didn't didn't anyone at QM notice all the clear channel execs around L'Oria? Oh yeah, in fact, they were all crap at in their pants that were so nervous about that. Don't feel too bad. There's a very long list of people lined up to kids David Samson's ass. Yes, chronic facts. So not only that most of those people are the same ones with the beginning of the season. We're talking about what an asshole he and his brother and la are father. What are your father and la is? I have a sense of humor. So I won't take what you said about my wife seriously. She's much prettier than a of your boyfriend. Well guess what? That's what you're wrong. I'm ego. That's where you haven't got to clue what you're talking about. If you only knew. Five six seven oh five sixty here's another facts. But the facts are pouring into the day. Thank goodness for that because the calls are really suck. In this cultural melting pot of assholes called South Florida's no wonder why no one gives a crap about the marlins. Do you really think this highly intellectual greasy crowd which you any motion toward a sports championship? People who don't realize that certain cities in towns would sacrifice their young virgins just to smell a championship little alone two and seven seasons. This is a town that got extremely emotional over senior crews. It always forgot all about that. That's a good point. Because you know, and again because I'm out of touch. I'm not there. I don't have the the feel for it. Like Tom Jikasin. I'm not that he was done so I can tell now. When the mortician lifted up my skirt. He said, I live alone alone alone. I can't do it. I can't out of the lake at home. It's a call. It's a call. It's a call. That says everything it says. As much as you rip off a local, can you imagine that I see don't start with his buffalo. Buffalo is a cesspool. Okay. Buffalo is garbage. As much as you rip off a local, can you imagine that time of the bills ever one one. The sick of you. After watching our game against Kansas City yesterday, I would hold my breath anytime in your lifetime who ever does any defense. The sickest part is I came to this town as a nice guy with business ventures and 10 years later, I'm sitting here realizing I've morphed into a soft photo asshole. Just like them. Thanks for your refreshing honest teacher. Why does this happen? There's so many good people when they come here. Anyone can answer this. I greatly appreciate it. It's called it goes with a territory. It says screw the marlins just based in the fact they represents South Florida. Mexico City, Marlins has a nice ring to it. Sign Pete. P.S. I do like Georgia in a video, but we all did not relate to four hours of marijuana slang or colors calling and offering little baggies of the green stuff from other other than that. He's adequate. Were you doing drug deals again on a year? No, they. How about off the year? Yes. No. Better way. Once I'm really good chef man, I brought George back at well. A brick. Long story. In your naval. A big brick. Five and we're going to throw right through the goddamn window with the party on Thursday. Yeah, that's right. You're all invited to come to the place for the big Wem ratings party. What a laugh that is. Especially where he says congratulations to Josh Duff Doreen and the entire QM said, well, what the hell is that all about what the hell is it done? It doesn't even put the gel on there who does more work in one day than that bitch is ever done in a whole life. That's number one. And number two, what the hell is the promotion department? Have to do with a successor ratings? Anything? Zero. They promoted us. Oh, is that what it was? Well, you mean like that big banner when they put up their, I would have left my knee off the speakers. That kind of stuff, huh? And we still beat everybody. All our mad dog man, seven five and at the two to four slot. Huh? I scroll in our mad dog. He's not there anyways in San Diego. Try to put out the fire. Five six seven between now and two o'clock. I want to hear a little bit of enthusiasm on your World Champion Marlins. This is of a disgrace. Aren't you amazed and shocked in the, uh, huh? No. No enthusiasm. Let's look at that poll. How much did the World Series win by tomorrow's impact your interest in the team? 286 votes. This is our second poll. The first one wasn't too promising on the stadium. Some, but I've been a fan all along 92. A bit. I watched some of all of the games, 88. That's what I voted. I watched a couple of things here in there. Not at all. I still don't give it to you. I've been about them 58, 20.2% and tons. I'm a real fan now. 48, 16.7% are real converts. They're really fans, at least to the parade is over. Now what's the story on the parade and the festivity? So it would be nice if somebody would cool me in on this stuff Scott. Since like time jickices, I'm so out of touch. I had to like it. Huh? I have no idea. Well, we are good about it. Well, not that David Ross is going to spirit the Marlin broadcast away from QAM. Oh, man. Oh, man. How are we going to survive after that? And like I said to Miami heat, what have they got about a point of point nothing? Just like on 940. Just like the same thing with a big the big challenge from Fox Sports 940 with their fractions. How did they do in the last book? I got a right here. I get for all the stuff you fax me that Thursday. Look, let's take a look at the morning where they're up against some stiff competition. Absolutely. The mole man and for real, at least if the first couple hours. Wiod 3638. This is in men. Okay. Now, what does the college? WRFX? Just and believe you me, I could make that. All I'm going to have point 6 to a 1.3. Oh, but there's still number 23 in the market. 50,000 watts with a 1.3 share. And the only reason they actually increased in this is because they've got the secret weapon on here now. So he's a mom prop prop prop problems. Right. The crow put them over the top. How about in midday? How about against us? How much do they were like dangerous? Especially with the one George. That's right. How how could you compete with Rome? I can't. Do you know if you are FX? Can we find them yet? Oh, I think they might have had like a double digit on here. From a 1.3 to a 2.1. See what I mean? They're on the move, baby. How about against the Humper and the Mount Mad Dog and the afternoon? Which by the way QA was number one in men with a 7.0. Let's take a look at our FX, huh? 0.6 more than double 1.4. Oh, oh, oh, look out now. Reminiscent shades of the fan. Remember the fan? No. 1790 on your AM dollar. But I'll tell you a little bit. No trouble. So we got to be real nervous about that. Plus David Ross with his fox sports. What is Miami Heat? And now with a Marlins. Good luck to him. Okay. We'll pack them up to the Lami Sandwich. WQA and Marlins line. You. Yes sir. Oh, I gotta go. I gotta do my break. One. What? Nothing. Find a handle here. I have to do the break now. Right. Time to talk to him. I'm sorry sir. I apologize. Okay. I'm just like a guy. I'm just like a guy. I'm just like a guy. But the fact is this spots are what we're here for. We got to get him on a year and spite that I've won. Got it. It's upset. We run so many spots. At least on this show we don't run all those sports spots. Like all the rest of the sports segments where they were like 56 minutes in our spots. You know, one of the best kept dining secrets in town is right there in Coral Springs. The Gold Coast seafood grill.

We're talking about the Gold Coast seafood grill. We're talking about the Gold Coast now we're at evil and here's the reason why we think she is. Her butts too big for her body too big for her body too big for her body. The dress can fit no more. No more. 133 to 56. You can't tell you we're really keeping on top of things you're at the Sports Center of the Universe. Not come to find out the dolphin game that I did not be played in San Diego Scott. It's being played in Arizona. How come nobody told me that? We did. You told me that? Or is it a go? Yeah, something like that. With major wildfires burning in the area yesterday the NFL moved it off and it was going to be a problem with listen. Move the game against the Charger Stein from San Diego to 10th year of Arizona. How many people are going to be at that game? You think they're driving in San Diego to 10p? No. You think anybody in 10p gives a flying crap about the Chargers or the dolphin? No. No. So that's to be interesting. Well that will take away the home field advantage from San Diego plus they suck anyway. So it should be like a walk over again. What do you think? I think the Panthers could beat the Chargers. Now I don't want to be talking about that stuff because of this other fact you just sent me here since they're so they're really hostile man. I think that the town to be like in a good mood. Right. High school. No. It says hey, gay guy in the radio. There is no one is calling you to talk about the marlins because you have repeatedly said. Now see here again you repeatedly said so if somebody listens every minute hangs on every single word you repeatedly said you show ain't no sports show and no sports holes are listening. Now whatever repeatedly said as I'll talk about whatever hell I want to talk about. So shut the f up and do what you do best. Criticize, criticize, criticize, criticize, anything and everything fed up with your BS. Signed Jeffrey Luria. No. It's not signed by anybody. Un signed like all of these kind of a lot of hostility coming. I guess they've missed me last 10 days, huh? Lots. Have an event at it. You would all last one. Are you kidding me? But that's not it. Now they love you. Yeah right. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound by. I want to hear before we only got 26 minutes to go till Joe Rose. And I want to hear one enthusiast to call one legitimately honest of a misent enthusiast with somebody's something that positive to say this is at its grace. Even for some for this is way above and beyond the call of duty if you ask me. WQAM enthusiasm line. Hey, how's it going man? Pretty good. Yeah. What's up Dave? Hey, let's go to Dave online too. Hello. Sock it. Yeah, suck this. See there. You know he was busy answering the good call. Yeah, that was a great call. WQAM. Hey, good afternoon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was a good. It was enjoyable. It was nice and winning. You know for change. But it'll be another few years because I'll break up the team like usual. How do you know that? Wow. You know, you know, you know. Charlie. Oh, I love it. The enthusiasm is just unbelievable. The sourest and nastiest the most hostile. And like I said before, it ain't never going to change. It's not me. I'm going to damn good mood. Main thing is reason is not there. That's a best reason. I'm going to good mood. Good going this Molly. What a pile of crap. Like I said, 24 minutes of counting waiting for one. Just one. Is it going to happen? No, not likely. Maybe I'm lying. That could be the magic line. WQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, they do and come about the mountains. Yes, go ahead. I'll tell you that the thing about the mountains is I used to this meal. Okay. I used to go to games a few years ago. And I remember that the whole sections would be like 23 people. Right. They're dogs. They're bread. It's correct. Bring picnic tables. Is this meal? I think so. Let me take a look. It looks like I haven't talked in a while. That's the thing. And so and I'm so in about like good seats. We're surprised. Probably nobody would ever go. So I don't really know what's going to happen. I think maybe she might be my big my big concern is that after this year I want to see if they break up the team because Well, after the first team went in every direction and nobody stayed back. So I want to see what's going to happen with that. But the other thing too before you get to emotionally excited is that we're trying to say because I tell you the thing is to I used to go to hockey games too and I kind of thought you know I like sports. I think I don't like cheap fans. That's the thing before it. I don't know if that's ever going to change down here. I'm not trying to say New York is all that. New York is a real team. A real city real real world. And they're like 15 million people within like shouting this. That's true. Most of the people in the Yorker under the edge of a hundred and speaking with yeah, but the other thing too, they've got a dynasty going. I mean, you know, the tune of the the braze and the Yankees. I mean, it's just like within the last 10 years, I think the Yankees have gone with six or seven times. So it's kind of a different ballpark. But I don't know. I don't want to take too much more of your time. It's just that I just wish it was more loyalty in this community. And I'm actually up in Gainesville now. But I'm going to you out, but I used to call you all the time. And I kind of miss you. I'm glad for the website too because I could listen to you like in the morning. I got for a website hanging there. I have a great thing. All right. You see, he was like kind of like Luke warm. He just doesn't want to get tangibly involved too heavy duty until he sees what the later lands go. He's a little bit skeptical to understand my sense of skeptical. Got a lot of caught a company out there. It's just was wonderful. It was a great experience that are going to stick it to us again. Now I haven't said that. Have I? No, it's a possibility. I have mentioned about Pudge because he's a guy that's going to command some serious books. You think he's going to be banned? The Pudge monster got the big expense of house with that monument to himself out there. He stands out in front of crosses himself and pointed the sky all day in the off season. Got a big ass. 567.0560. Come on. Let's have one really enthusiastic Marlon call. They won the World Series two freaking days ago. It's only Monday. It's only Monday. You have to be a sports nerd.

Especially on the day like today, it was just every how many times do I say this? Every time I say the same thing. I always think that I can't be shot by the responses software, but yeah, they can always pull another big surprise for you. Hey, you think that was exciting. You see all those people on the parade? Well, we don't give a crap. Okay. And then the responses, oh, all the sport nerds that are one who get well, that's pretty sad. Because we already know about the sports nerds. What kind of crowd that is? Did the ones calling Goli? Oh, let's build a stadium right next door to my house. How does that sound? What's up, somebody else's money? Of course. Let's build our right next door. It's not convenient for us, you know? And how is it that they got those 66,000 people in here for game five? Scott, how do they get those people in everyone such a bad place to play? And it's so hard to get to, and it's such a crappy stadium. How do they do it? That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. I'm not joking. I'm not joking. Just like that. 19 till two a QAM.

Kimbo bull camper tomorrow and Wednesday and I go on hopper excellence schedule. Dr. Phil is a fraud. Get out. That's the shocking revelation of two former guests who said the show's produces paid a stranger to insult them on camera to range for a photographer to do the same. They saw firsthand what a fraud doctor Phil's show is and they want the whole world to know about it. The source close to the woman told the prestigious inquire. Mary Ann Baudelay 400 p.a. 400 p.a. a administrator of the National Association to Advance Fatak Settons Napa and Sally Smith 374 p.a. a big beautiful woman magazine when a doctor Phil McGraw show last November. The lady said that after years of worshiping Dr. Phil's work they were thrilled to be invited out of his program to assess discrimination against overweight people. They said they thought they would be treated with respect. But before they could appear on the show, producer sent them an undercover mission to last Vegas. They said a hidden camera followed them around her hopes that strangers would make fun of them in public because of their weight. But the whole thing is Dr. Phil would say drove off into the ditch, Sally wrote an article about her experience. No one insulted the woman they said until program staffers arranged it. The producers were convinced they would get what they needed Sally, role well they eventually did but they had to actually pay one man to make a rude comment and convince the poor horrified camera operator to expedite the students as something mean to us. The crew then moved to Laudée, women to Los Angeles, set the number of restaurants to two diners, known to dislike fat people, hoping the strangers would say something nasty, it didn't happen Sally said. When the show aired in November of you were some Marianne and Sally visiting a mall of fitness center in a buffet restaurant. Can you say those two walking into a buffet? That's a set up for a joke, right? Hidden camera footage showed onlookers snickering supposedly at the overweight ladies. A different times in the restaurant one man asked, is that fat free ice cream and another told a woman leave some food for somebody else. But it was all a scam designed to fool Dr. Phil's viewers, the ladies say. Sally said she and her friend Marianne had been loyal fans of Dr. Phil from his days on Oprah. When one of us called the other with a problem our media response would be, what would Dr. Phil say Sally we called, what a silly bitch. The women told a pali appeared on the show hoping to change the self-help gurus philosophy that being fat as a psychological flaw that can be overcome through willpower but once I'm to show the rose cover glasses to which we'd seen Dr. Phil shattered Sally claimed. Echoes on it, like a great length. Anything we can do to not Dr. Phil we say. A rock. Excellent. He's a piece of crap total fraud. Another drooling southerner. Taxi. 360 votes there are votes. 359.
