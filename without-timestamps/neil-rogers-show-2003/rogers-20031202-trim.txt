Go, you'll, you'll, let's read, oh, read, oh, big child! That's how we've asked the time all wait in the geo jail of ours. It's time to get it on! Move, how we're the monkey faster! Has a variable this knows! When he gets raped or plastered, the phased on his nose will blow the tumble. Everybody hates him except the handful of homo. Sorrowful, calm, great kids. Grab the morning show that close. One day the well-tressed red breed has called him to read my CTS needs a new headline. You mind if I borrowed your veins tonight. There's another line that goes here. But I'm a love of magic, it was her fluency. I'm listening. I'm listening. 10, I wanted 5, 60, WCM. We must be both psychic because we're just talking moments before it. He concludes in the geo row show this morning. Near moments ago. That it was going to be a financial thing. See they keep making up these stories about well, NBC6 has to decide what a georos can do. Permanent 8 to 10 on QIM. Well, they can decide that it's either... Or it's one of the other can two seconds. And the fact that he's been fillin' now for about 100 weeks indicates the main answer is, yes, pretty simple. So that's just a cover story for the fact that the beastly is too cheap. He's tried to squeeze a lot more money out of Greg because he's got him over a barrel. He's got about a short hairs. We all know that. Gwals is going to stick in there between 8 and 10. And the very jackass three points out accurately, that it's going to be georos with Gildy. Because Gildy don't want to be working with that cranky old man one more day. What? But he told me that that last Friday that I was there. I told he stopped me in a hallway. I went in to take a leak. And I thought I was going to pee my pants. Not because he was so funny, but because I couldn't get inside the tea room. Because he did bap bap bap bap bap bap. He was just squeaking up a storm, man. Well, it's not a secret. Oh, it's not? And of course, in most case, I guess at this point, what difference does it make it? Yeah, one more person that he finds out hates him like poison. What difference is going to possibly make? Because he's batting a thousand. Got to give him that. Drop in the ocean. Everybody in the building hates him like poison. So who's going to work with him? Beast? I think that would be. That was the beast there today. Ah, yeah. He is. He's the one that pointed out the article to me. I'll ride. Let's hear maybe when maybe he was doing that. So we would talk about it. And then maybe he's getting back in the door. Because if John guilty, you're going to be together again. We sure don't need the beast in there. But again, being a third person, third demand in. Right. Right. Right. Maybe we would get the beast to come in and discuss with us for about 10 seconds. Just a joke. Bees get out. How is it fast? What do you mean? You're going to get in. You're going to get in. So what does he got to say? Put him over there by that mic. Okay. He's coming in here, boy. He can't. I'll put a way to support. He's going to be a big indication. I'm hoping his big point. You're the better chance of me being anorexic. Yeah. You working with more again. Well, he sees easy for you to say that. And open up a big story and push. But if a powers that be taken to that sit, you're not going to like walk out. And not going to walk away from a. A plus job. What if they make it off for you? Can't refuse. Right. What if they say, hey, well, double your pay. And we'll let you sit in his lap a couple of days. Like it paid six bucks an hour now. Right. That's right. He has rich parents. He doesn't have this. And you get to split the freebies from how he's with the moment. But Beast has to do all the tipping. Right. What do you say? No. No. He's won't take. What would it take? What would it take? Would Moha have to let you like change his hairpiece every day during the show and rub his ball spot when I do it like a Buddha? Only if the Beast doesn't have to clean out his bag anymore. And listen to this. And Moha might be inspired to leave the piece home because could you see the two shiny ballspots. Hey, my sign. And make a great. Make a great billboard. If you press her heads together would be illegal and braward. Oh yeah. Rub it up. Throw Moha in the tub. Absolutely. I can just see it now. Okay. That's it. Five beast. What is it? Start. Once he's starting with Moha. Or he's already started with Moha. Oh, I'm sure. No. Woman Rams Carr and the gas pump after clerk won't sell her booze. This is a great story. Got a lot of good stuff here. Including Barry Jackass's column. Thank you Beast by the way for pointing that out because you're the only one. That's pretty nothing to building to be very jackass. So he's the only one knew about it. Plus Moha and Joe. I'm thinking that what? Because I'm not really big on the cross over thing. It was fine with Correll. We had a lot of good fun. But you know. But Joe and I, Joe does a sports show and I do my own wacky thing here. But I'm thinking that maybe once in a while Joe and I could have a good time. You can spark his dirty end. I was like just Jones into jump in, you know. More to. Oh man, Joe got like curated way a little bit there. Rip and Moha and ass about Barry Jackass and about Don't Feel Back. Because Grace's program is entertaining and don't have to refer to it every day. And I know you're not listening and all I could stop. Absolutely. But maybe we could do like a low cross over once in a great while. Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking about it. Yeah. I was thinking about it. That was just tiny. Oh, we better be before we do the story about the woman ran the Agass pump. Here's the results from yesterday's marginal second pool. Actually, we had a pretty good response. 958 votes for a, well, I was a good pull question. I just don't think they get it because we got so many perkyl people there who don't go nowhere. In what city in the world you find the highest percentage to the people are very, very, very ugly. Even uglier than me, which is sandalot. High Alia, which was a late edition. Past everybody else like it was standing still, man. High Alia, 237. Is that true? I don't get to High Alia's often as I use. I haven't been to High Alia since the last time I was at the race track there, which is about Oh, years and years and years ago. Yeah. Remember that that I would be when we were trying to save High Alia and I still don't know why because John Brennan he was real asshole. I haven't been to High Alia since I stopped working at these so-ing. Since before he's used was a baby. High Alia, 237. And a Tampa 141 and Hollywood Florida 111. That's the frog factor again. But you noticed the fact that the top three in our poll result happened to be in Flored Dub because most of the people in Flored have an LED on it. Don't get around too much. So they had a fee per all the month. You're all there over 100. I'm proud of that 102. That was the obvious clear choice. Montreal 102. Cleveland of very competitive second 97. G. Perry Paris France was the only non-North American city on air. Paris said 80. O'Calla had 70. Nashville 49. Reading Pennsylvania 36. I don't think there's that many people. Everybody's Pennsylvania. How many people are there? Not 36. The English people in the world are in Reading PA. Ashville, North Carolina 33. And Bartholomew, which I still don't believe had six votes after Pine Ed's bogus. Probably somebody couldn't get laid and Barcelona said that. Sargrapes. Not buying it. So that's yesterday's poll result. We got two great polls for you again today. Should we do the first one? I give the first one. Quickly. Okay. What was your take on G. W. Bush's surprise thing? Give it. Now you didn't do this on Friday. No, I did not. I was amazed that people that's right. I didn't do it because you did that one about what's more important. Living forever or having a horseshoe up your ass. Right. What was your take on George W. Bush's surprise thing? Giving visit to the troops in Iraq. We got five choices for you here. It was strictly politics. It was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary. It was clearly courageous designed to bolster troop morale. Why did these day longer and see what's really happening? Or it was a sorry ass photo op. Nothing more. I think that covers all the bases don't you? What was your take on G. W. Bush's surprise thing? Giving visit to the troops in Iraq on Thanksgiving Day. It was strictly politics. It was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary. It was clearly courageous designed to bolster troop morale. Very courageous by the way. So courageous that he was watching the radar almost every second. He said of the trip and Air Force. What he saw the British airways guy. He almost made them turn around and go back. But it was very courageous. Yeah. From our A-wall president. Why did he stay longer and see what's really happening? Or it was a sorry ass photo op. Nothing more. Which I think is probably the definitive answer. Woman Rams car at a gas pump after Kirk won't sell her alcohol. Dini police are searching for a woman who ran her car to a gas pump early this morning. Cousin the pump to explode. And catch fire after intended to refuse to sell her alcohol. Shortly after five o'clock this morning police say a woman who appeared to be inebriated. Locked under the SIPCO gas station. I wonder how Brian Murray would say that. The SIPCO gas station at 3301 North University drive and try to purchase wine and beer. The clerk refused to sell those to the woman described as a five foot five blind wing about 120 pounds. Siting city and county ordinances that prohibit the sale of beer or why before six an a.m. She became irate and started screaming at the clerk but he held his ground. Maybe police would tend to build banford said. The woman ninja. WQAM. Hello. Yes. Neil. Yes sir. Are you doing all you picking up the cold huh? Well I just saw the line ringing out of the corner my eyes. I thought I'm up pretty important. I just want to see I think you should combine the first one the last one kind of for the same It's across over. You know more to sorry as far as the movie motivated. A little bit slightly different nuance but yeah they're they're close. Yeah that way you might get a true or true gauge on the. Okay. By the way that's my. I'm officially chummy and is the first vote. What's which one? You know politically motivated nothing more than a sorry as photo up as the same thing. It was just embarrassing and I'm just I just I can't. I can't humiliated and we don't. I'm the most embarrassed by the so called the Democrats and liberal punnets were afraid to call it for what it really was. Why why why is everybody so why is everybody afraid. Well what what's going on it. Why. Why. We're in the micomores out there. We're in the micomores out there. I don't get it. They're all like they all have to be very you know on there like walking on egg shells. I mean we're tower veal when you need them you know exactly okay. Have a great day pal. Actually a real call or a right off the bat see I knew it. I saw it on the corner of my eye. We're going to reset delicious computer because he can't answer the phone. Just so you know. Although we don't even answer the phone. Okay. Um anyway this woman became our rate and started screaming at the clerk but he held his ground. The woman then jumped into a dark colored car squeal out of the parking lot before leaving the area. She slammed on her brakes raised backward and her vehicle. Strecking a gas pump which exploded and erupted into flames. She left behind the back bumper of her vehicle in the parking lot. The clerk told police the woman often comes in the store and lives nearby. They have a video with a woman from a camera installed in the gas station. He texted us our searching release. They were probably got her ass already searching nearby apartment complexes. Looking for the vehicle we're expected to make it a rest today. Ponto because as she left first of all the bumper from the car and secondly they got her on tape and thirdly she's there all the time. And she had a little problem. Okay. Now probably was just an accident. Don't you think? Oh yeah. I'm sure. Well happens all the time and Florida. Guys the old forest. They think that they're hitting the break and actually the salarator. Oops. Oops. There we go. Now we have that very jackass story that we all missed yesterday. But it's a good thing because nobody was listening yesterday anyway because it was today after Thanksgiving weekend. And we're just now starting to put the pieces of our lives back together again. So we got a very very important, uh, more Howard David very jackass story from yesterday's money hurled. And then a bunch of other crap as well. And that first pull. Which will be up momentarily by the way. Just took a look over there and I thought for sure it'd be up there already but it was like my bad. Why is that? Because I haven't faced until like two minutes ago. You didn't facet in the air again. I facet in the air like at 738 this morning. Yeah, no. Fuck. 12 minutes after 10 at 560 WQM Imagine Imagine Todd Rek. Bleeding to death in your living room. Imagine zero closing cause.

The Reneckel housing lender restrictions apply rates are subject to change monthly 5.19 APR. The blockbuster hit pirates of the Caribbean followed by hunted mansion and now the Disney studios presents another exciting film based on an old park ride. It's Michael Jackson's. You can't eat all that I think we're under attack. Don't bother me now. I'm trying to find pigs so carries. Oh, they're handling us. Okay, here I come. Oh, and that's what you're gonna do. We have a warrant Mr. Jackson. Can't be yourself off. Oh, get the escape pass ready. I grant I can't keep hope. The escape pass ready. Oh, I'm sorry, all the sisters had tapes are in the now. Oh, oh, I'm not. Oh, my God. Michael Jackson stars in Captain Heal by a ticket at your data suit because he's rich. So he must be better than us. 10.19 at 5.60 we got the a new national enquire where I got some right here a little bit later on. All the latest on a little bit more spicy stuff in there. Jackson victim speaks where claims Jacko took new photos of men showed him x-rated videos. Oh, my God. I'd like that. There's more than meets the eye to this Michael Jackson story, but nevertheless more than. Again, the media just never failed or was taught to me. For example, the fact that they found this tape where the mother and, you know, she says, Oh, he was nothing but a wonderful to them and the family and the kid and there was everything in appropriate. What kind of a person has a parent make a tape like that? Unless unless they have reason to fear that they shoe is about to drop. See what I'm saying? Why would you ever have anybody make a tape like that? Can you look at you make a tape that says he always nice and, you know, God can't walk that out. Anyway, they're just a crawl on CNN. I saw the corner of my other eye moments ago. You and study says the flow of money, arms and support for Al Qaeda is growing rapidly. Now, isn't this exactly what the Osama Yamama said predicted was going to happen? Right. If we invaded Iraq, ever that poster we had a comical line. Right. I want you to invade that. Exactly. And the bus said, okay. Sure. We got that big hose all set the the Chevron people to hook up to the gas to the oil. And here we're supposed to be fighting the evil diversion. Instead, we're wasted a hundred billion dollars in all of these lives against a bunch of people who their biggest crime was living under a brutal dictated that the CIA stuck in in the first place. God, that was the biggest crime all these people that are dying. And then that bank heist that took place over the weekend. Well, all of those people supposedly were were insurgents. Iraqi insurgents come to fight out a bunch of more just sluppers who happened to be in a wrong place at the wrong time as usual, at least the ate them. And maybe a lot more. They had a little bit of mo. Well, let's see how that pull is started. Now we got to smell all spattering of hope. Just went on there. See, that's bad. We got to get those on there right away. My bad. Don't be doing that no more. Alex, who's just obsessed. Well, we got so many people obsessed with this program. I mean, just obsessed. You know what I mean? Uh-huh. In fact, I'm listening. See what I mean? Oh, listen, if I should have come all believe you may talk about the shoe drop and by the way, I wouldn't count on being around till the spirit of 2006. Based on some conversations I had before to show this morning with certain powers that be. They're planning on having a wini roast at PPP Park before the next dolphin home game. And right at the 50-yard line, they're going to put him on like a, like a pig on a spit. And they're going to roast them all right there in the 50-yard line. Wouldn't that be a beautiful thing? I think you might actually show up for that game. Yeah, I would. Ha ha ha ha. I'll bring a cake. Oh. Yeah, they can make most sandwiches of the concession stand. I'm listening. Okay, calm down. You silly old fart. Allure says, hey, Neil, I think the measlies are starting to make their final decision on the morning show till the end of the dolphin season so they can blow mold a hell out of there. And then that way bring back Bill's zipper back to work with the man dog. Everything will be back to the go-rule days. Life without mold will truly be paradise. Gurn in hell, mold and take one from little of Andy with you. And then it says, we hate mold in gigantic letters with eight million exclamation Park. Maybe not eight million, but leave it. Stop, turn man. He prepping mold. It says it's great. And it is great in the sunshine stay. And especially knowing that is listening right now and hanging on every word. I'm listening. I know when a Joe Rose ripped him a major ass. Now maybe Alex is on a something for once, you think? Like, I'm not saying to the go away to the end of football season because they can't wait that long. But maybe the idea is that somewhere along the line here, they'll pay the assario old man off. All the way, don't think the measlies will do that. And then have Joe and the guilty honor, six to ten. Why would they divide it up? Why would they do a silly thing like that? They did to be forced away to get for a while on the air, which they now regret, unfortunately. It just turned out bad all the way around. It was a great concept, but the, the let's you say about that to better. And then this morning, seven, 15, I come in here like I do every morning. Drag my ass out of bed and before I shave, shower, smitten to all the other things. I open up the pot. Smoke a little. Now I open up the pot. Listen to whatever's going on. Just to make sure that we are in contact. And there's a mole. And he's going on the first thing I hear right out of the box. Well, I plucked through old fur else fans out there. I plucked a scott yesterday. And he's doing just fine. Forrelants doing fine. And these are okay. And I thought to myself, you know, for where you are, you're on worst enemy. Because you don't know who your friends are. I'm sure he's listening right now too. Scott, you just don't get it, do you? Here's a guy that like danced on your grave. The minute after you got canned, went on the year and encouraged his audience for three solid hours to call him. He begged them and pleaded and controlled them to call him and rip you an ass. And danced on your grave and effected you got your ass fired. And at the meantime, you're talking to this son of a bitch. This miserable bastard. That's a looting. Wow, man. Aren't you shocked at that? Well, what's his intent? First we already know that some people never know that. Listen, that's unfortunate for all of us. Because it was like somebody putting a pin prick in the good, your blimp, the whole of a forrel thing, you know? We have remember kept talking about that mole. Mentor that we had. Not following mole, no mole. We had a big mole. Menton, go when I could feel it. You could smell it. And then all of a sudden it was like, like that. Like somebody stuck it with a pin. And just feel like a prick. And speaking of prick's very jackass writes in yesterday's Miami-Herald column in his rambling column. In response to a recent column about WQA and struggle. And by the way, Joe Rose is in with Gregory right now they're hammering out the deal. Okay, so have no fear. Because he wouldn't be in there talking about money if NBC-680 Pro. Why would they have any problem with them doing it? Just a higher visibility for their sports guy. Right. Right. Of course. They're not going to have any problem with that. So don't you have folks worry about that. And I've really got all whipped up when Joe started ripping both the end of the show. I think that I really believe that can be a regular feature. Right. Can we be a regular? We don't have to cross over. He's good at himself. Because he hates mole with a passion. It's just, see, it's one thing when people dislike somebody who works in a workplace. Everybody dislikes that person. This is way beyond dislike. This is a hatred. So deep. It's like a purple rage. You know what I mean? Hmm. You can see the veins in their neck. The veins in their forehead start like trying to pop out. You know? Just at the mention of the other person's name. So it probably will please you know and mode and know that Joe hates you even more than I do if that's possible. And guilty echoes that emotion. He's going to have to be in there for another few days. Whatever it's going to be. He can't wait till the last day when he, uh, Well, you don't darken his life. No, no, no. Can't stand it. Can't take it. Told me that right to my push right outside the T room there. That Friday. I could get five of the date. That Friday in November. 2003. Could get to hell away from me. He just went on and on whining like a child. Don't let me forget to get to the very jackass column. By the way, oh, I will. Well, we got great time again, man. We got to get these spots in here. We got a lot of caller to come in there. Screamless because Josh can answer the phone. That's okay. Don't worry about those things. Don't worry about anything at all because life is sweet. You know, the checks are clear in a bank places going to hell on a hand basket. Greg is doing his best to try to put the pieces back together. He keeps smashing him and crashing him. You heard what the clearance said this morning about mode engine. I better not repeat it. No better not. 61 votes on a poll so far. What was your take on George W. Bush's surprise Thanksgiving visit to the troops in Iraq? It was a sorry ass photo up nothing more 28. It was clearly a courageous act designed to bolster troop morale 12. Why didn't these stay longer and see what's really going on? 9. It was strictly politics 7 and it was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary 5. Dropsdade's sworey. Hey, Shelley Bloom's fashion quote.

I have a great app. With opens wide as they say. Yeah. Does it feel weird to make love to someone while your husband's watching? No. Absolutely not. He's right skeptical at first. Really? No, I just so care. I want to do them because I want to I want the experience. Yeah. Always been like that. Oh god. Yeah. That's right. It's like food. You've always been a good ride. I have. I have 32 at 5 60. That would be funny. No, the story of this. Thanks me Louisiana School punishes 70 year old for talking about lesbian mother. Mm-hmm. Just happens to be on our website. I have it sitting here in my pile. But thank you anyway. Whoever sent it. I mean, we do appreciate appreciate all of this stuff like Bob Lansardy's to say we appreciate it. But the fact that a matter is if you check out the 80 million good stories that we have on our website every day, then you save us a lot of time and grief. And thanks paper. Am I right? Yes. Right. Also before I do get to that very jackass story, CNN speaking of polls is taking a poll on near our website. And the question is, the Cincinnati Police act appropriately in subdoing a few hundred and see it's amazing. The good news for him is he lost 50 pounds in one day. The bad news is he still dead. Work day tell us yesterday he was 400 pounds. Right. Did Cincinnati Police act appropriately in subdoing a 350 pound man who later died? And, of course, we've all seen that video over and over. How many times we've seen it? About 30 man? At least. 57,287 votes is of a win of right printed this thing out. 57,287. Yes. 71 percent. No. 29 percent. He, they found the cocaine and PCP in a system. Got it? And? What's he doing? He was stunned man. He was out of control. Haven't you watched it over and over and over? Slow, Mow free stream. Instant replay. Haven't you watched it? Yeah. Midden times. I'm not all about it. But he was black and fat. Had a record? Had a rat sheet as long as the beast penis. And what the, I'm more, could you want? Was it a hit record? Anyway, here's the a very jackass story. I'm looking at there's speaking of our pool. But that it was between the British Airways pilot and the controlled tower. But regardless, British Airways says that they have still not heard anything from any of their pilots that they saw. Yes, you see the pilots are keeping quiet. You want to know why? Because they'll value their lives. Mhm. Well, they just don't want to be interrogated and, you know, raked over the coals and then maybe like son off to see the queen and never show up again. You know how those things go? Look at a way that polis turn out. This is shocking to me. What was your take on GW Bush's surprise Thanksgiving visit the troops in a rat? It was a sorry as photo up nothing more. 55. That's 50%. But it was clearly courageous designed to bolster troop morale 25. That's 23%. Are you believe in any of this audience? 20% of our buying in that crap? No. It was strictly politics 14. Why didn't he stay longer and see what's really happening in a rack 10? And it was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary. Five out of 100 nine votes. 23% so far say it was clearly courageous designed to bolster troop morale. I'll question about it. Courages. That's why it was like kept top secret even from most of them from, Did you know that the Bush won and Martha Washington, whatever hell of her name is? Bads? They didn't even know about it? No, I didn't know that. They didn't even know about it. And Laura only found out about like a couple days ahead of time. She said, oh, maybe he won't come back or something like that. How do you like that? Really courageous, which is why like I said he kept checking the radar. Anyway, we'll get to that later. Here's Barry Jackass's column. It took me 35 minutes to get to it. Nice going Neil. Thank you. So whipped up because the Joe Rose is great comments. You're the end of his show. Yeah. Could have knocked me over with the feather. You go, Joe. You're the man. See, he's pulling the gloves off. He's going to be. I'm listening. Rip and mow and answer every day for which is another reason. The most reading nervous and crawling people like Barry Jackass. In response to a recent column about WQMs struggle to find a viable long term. Morning show. Dolphins radio and answer Howard David called. Mean called Barry Jackass. To defend his record and assist he will continue doing a talk show at least through the end of his contract in the spring of 2006. Absolutely. David points out that in the most recent ratings book he and Steve Geldy Goldstein's every day five point share between six and eight a.m. Among the key, male 25 to 54 demographic group. Topping the 3.6 to do what generated a year earlier in that slot. In that slot. Back home. While fired, 8 to 10 a.m. host Scott Reldezers a lot of credit, especially in attracting younger audience. What we did between six and eight with the trackers in our own radio station is something I'm proud of said David, who called a syndicated Minnesota San Luis game Sunday and WQM and made many mistakes. WQMs hopefully convincing Joe Rose to handle the 8 to 10 a.m. slot with Goldstein says. Barry Jackass. How do you like that? Yeah. Huh? He trackers in the radio station. Like, I'm sure he means us, but generally like everybody because he's used to taking it up to buy from everybody in the building. You know what I'm saying? I take a lot. And Geldy just bug off for you. God. Hey, that's a good looking guy. Okay, come down. Joe Rose and Geldy were the happy two happy to be buddies to begin with. In fact, it was Joe that brought squeaky Geldy into the worst team in the first place, which created at the time a lot of, well, I don't want to say a lot, but a certain degree of conflict because it was always when there's three people involved in a project like that. Like three people involved in partnership and a business. It's always two to one. I mean, unless it's unanimous, it's always going to be two against one. And in that case, it was always Joe and Geldy against Defoe, poor Defoe on the outside. No wonder he went to the Indians in, you know, big for forgiveness or whatever the hell I was. You see what I'm saying? So there's the, it's not long. It's just a short piece in there, but there's some real interesting meat in the story there by Barry Jackass, who was much of a lemon and a weasel and a simple denazise and a little momma's boy. The fact that a matter is that he gets the inside poop because first of all, Mohour David had called him, which is embarrassing. And secondly, the thing about the Joe and Geldy, he knows because I'm sure that Greg told him that. Right? Right. Because he gets it right from the horse's ass, right from Greg, right from our general mangle, the Humpty Dumpty man, who's sitting in there with Joe, right now, Rose right now, talking turkey, you can take that to the bank post. They're sitting in there hammering it out. They're hammering it right now. Have her turkey. They're hammering it old bird. But, Dota QM is hopeful convincing Joe Rose to handle the A to 10 AM slot with Goldstein, the Joe and Geldy show, the first team junior. Right? Right. The first team junior. Oh. So, there's the latest scuttle, but from inside, the never-ending soap opera that is WQAM, where we can never get all our toes on the ground. And let me say again, for real, you're a good guy. You didn't have a good time working with you. It was a blast even though you got a death wish. But the fact that a matter is when, and we find out you're talking to Mohour on the phone. If I heard Mohour's voice on the phone, he'd hear it, you hear it right away. I get so fast. There you go. Sounds like a devil told to me. With a ankle in it, you're being a detractor. Yeah, another deal. What does that line he used again? Uh, what we did between six and eight would detractors know on radio station is something I'm proud of. This is the same guy who very shortly after he started his morning abortion on his station. Erred his audience, not to listen to the show that followed him. And he's talking about detractors on a station. How are you kidding you? Backstabbing phony old Kikah who you kidding man. I thought they had detractors on the farm. Yeah, right. Detractors are out in the yard trying to clear the way for your bang to scrape you there. God. Oh, what a piece of turd. 1039, 21 to 11 at 560. Let's take a look at this number from up Miguel.

Barbara Walden. Good evening and welcome to 2020. I've interviewed Christopher Reeve. Many times since the accident that paralyzed from eight years ago. But I wasn't prepared for the amazing achievement I witnessed this time. I have never talked to you without. I've never done this in Broadway. This is the first time. Something remarkable. My goodness is this interesting. This is the first time I've ever done this time. A very moment. And that's our program for tonight. Thank you for joining us. I'm Bob McWartys. I'm a Tiga Knifel. Anyway, a paid 60-arch post is Big Night for WD testers. This a misplug puts it on her own website, which is kind of amusing because it takes a little shot at her. She's probably fudge pack and right now. Kirby Rantuse as him star David Larry David's wife, Laurie, a full buzz for a nice political pow-off liberal Hollywood activist after she dubbed at the hate bush event. To which we said, Oh right. While the strategy session at the Beverly Holt naturally has the considerably less inflammatory title, a mandatory meeting to change the leadership in American 2004. Laurie and Evan environmentalists called a cause to stir when she forwarded invites with the email heading hate bush December second event. Internet gossip mismatched fudge cleafly seized upon a hate bush story yesterday, noting that the meeting will be shared by Harold Ickys, Bill Clinton's former White House deputy chief of staff, and Clinton Gore campaign manager and Ellen Malcolm, found where of Emily's list of group dedicated to electing pro-choice democratic women. Former AFL-CIO political director Steve Rosen-Towell also chair according to an invited pain by paid six, but Ari Emmanuel, founding partner of the powerful and devoured holiday agency, brother of Clinton White House staff, a Roma manual, an agent to Larry David and Westwin Quitter Aaron Sorkon, bristle at the hate bush allabaloo, people are assembling over a political issue, the 2004 election of the manual told us, I didn't know the free assembly was a bad thing. The invite didn't say hate bush, and I don't take the drug story was productive, a manual to kind of say who will support, but assure us it won't be bushed, which we say. Oh right. And not with neither will I we. Many, many times. I just mentioned that in passing. What do we got percentage wise? 21 and a half percent say it was a courageous thing and that enough to make you want a puke? Yeah. Means it's 21 and a half percent of the audience that got sucked in or that summer, they're just a bunch of suckle fans or were being prepped. Nah. We got 181 votes. What was your take on George W. Bush's surprise Thanksgiving visit to the troops in our rack? It was a sorry ass photo opportunity, nothing more, 93, 51.3 percent. It was clearly courageous designed to boost the bolster troop morale 39, 21 and a half percent. And by the way, that's the wrong answer. It was strictly politics 21. Why didn't these stay longer and see what is really happening 21? It was a brilliant way to backstage Hillary 7 out of 181 vote. Now. Now? Well, I was going to read the normal Ken story because I'm sure he's listening to out there right now. Another self-aggrandizing silly person. I'm listening. WQAM. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Fine. Okay. I don't know if you heard it yesterday, but General Clark was in town yesterday. Hello, meeting over the embassy street. Sir, I'm going to talk about that later on. He said, did you know that his father was Jewish? I know that after that, he attended an eight seminar at a synagogue that had over 600 people in attendance. Right. And he did a very long job, yeah. I haven't been a big fan of his, but I figured I'd go and care what he had to say. And he did a really good job. I think he's the one that might be able to be pushed. He never stole a freight train. I'll tell you that. No, and he might be able to get some of the right wingers to help the little sort of left. But if I was him, I wouldn't be a real person to delay. Beats. It's okay. But I wouldn't be an out seem to the whole world too much, especially in the deep south that his father was Jewish. And about his Jewish roots, I'd be kind of keeping that quiet, you know? He's still a good looking white guy. There you go. Good looking white guy. Nothing wrong with that. Have a great day, sir. Good looking white guy. What's wrong with a good looking white guy? That's what I've always said. Large, well, I'll put that ahead of the normal kind story. Large thumbs for Jewish votes, which explains why he's been hanging out at the Deli Dan and the Rascal house. Oh, he's coming to find out he's got a little Jew in him. Deli Beach, Connecticut Senator Joel Jew Lieberman, may have been in the sentimental favorit in South Florida after a few thousand butterfly ballots, prevented him from becoming Vice President in 2000. But he, I think would be appropriate if he were the Vice President. Or, or, but he wasn't the presidential candidate during a standing war on a crown of synagogue until Ray Beach yesterday. We turned army general Wesley Clark stepped into Jew Lieberman country, throwing hundreds to him, talk about his Jewish roots and his support for Israel. Oh, the general who's come under fire from Lieberman and his other Democratic rivals for a shifting Stances on the Iraq War and his passport for Republicans left little doubt about his goal, but a woman stood up to ask how he can rid the field of these spoilers, who stand between him and the nomination. I think she's talking about Senator Lieberman Clark boomed in the microphone at Temple M. M. It was, I think it was the M. M. Maybe he's got a speedy fact. Later speaking to reporters, Clark called his common a joke, but it underscored the developing rivalry between the two contenders who both decided to skip the January 19th Iowa caucuses. Now, watch it listen to this. They plan to focus on winning other primaries in later weeks in more moderate states like South Carolina, Oklahoma, and Arizona. Now, the idea that you leave early is going to win votes in South Carolina, Oklahoma and Arizona is so, you know, Wesley Clark, you know, no question about it. More moderate states like South Carolina. More moderate states, right, like South Carolina. Oklahoma. And the hotbed of Irby Wright Wing, for the analytical organization that's been kicked out of California, Arizona. More moderate states, which I think tells you a lot about the fascist you were talking about. The fascist you were saying right there. If those in the moderate states, I'd hate to see which ones that they extreme right wing ones. Clark and Lieberman, along with North Carolina Senator John Edwards, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, and Missouri representative Dick Gibhart, are trying to survive the primaries long enough to challenge for Mara Romant Governor Howard Dean, who leads in polls and fundraising. Did nice job. I didn't see the whole thing on last night on, what does that stupid show? Hardballs. Would Chris Matthews and why do they always have to start with a game marriage thing? You don't always have to throw a big song to dance and it has to ask the same question 50 million times. And how are Dean says what difference does the make what you call it, whether it's civil union or marriage? It means exactly what Wesley Clark said last week, full and equal rights for everybody, period whatever it had you call it. And I think that those people are insisting on, you know, back in anybody in the corner about the, you know, what you call it a marriage. Well, what that difference does make what you call it, call it spread. Most marriages in America are fraud anyway, so who'd outcares? Anyway, the floor to primary said for March 9, while the nominees expected to be decided with a flurry of big-state primaries on March 2, strategists for some campaigns believe the floor to vote could prove a decisive vote if a legitimate challenger to Dean emerges in the nomination remains in doubt. All nine Democrats, trying to attend the state's democratic party convention this weekend in, anxious or land though. Most of the candidates have devoted time to raising money at private events in Florida, among them is Clark, who collected about a hundred granted to private mimey fundraiser Monday night, but he also made it repeated public appearances. He is retina. Here's the part I like. He's rallied crowds in Jewish delies in Hollywood and Sunniiles, aka the Delhi den and the Rascal House. And money. Just to show that he's one of them, he actually stuffed a few bagels into a sacky brother-law. Yeah, he stuffed some sweet moan a couple of bagels and a couple of bill pickles into a sack that is a- Aids' problem. Is it luck, Mag? Right. Monday, he, once again, would a constituency that most experts earlier believe belonged to Lieberman and Orthodox Jew who started on the polls. The crowd applauded Clark Monday, his e-chided president Bush for his handling opposed war Iraq. Clark promised a new more internationalized approach to foreign policy. He spoke of learning lay did life that his father who died when Clark was three was Jewish and a native of Minsk Belarus You don't wear my grandmother was from Minsk Minsk Or you're like that Anna Solomon they could have been kin my man Wesley Clark my man He spoke of his personal visit Israel in 1976 of evening. He shared with Prime Minister. He had to talk rubbing I wonder if he said it's Fuck what I would have done that I would have done good. You know got him a lot extra votes Less than even get out free brisket and put hydrolock is couldn't hurt I was overjoyed and thrilled and happy Clark said of learning of his ties to Judaism I'm so proud of my Jewish family and my Jewish heritage. I just want he started to sound like barba stumbling out I just love Israel the Jewish people the Jewish people I love Israel and I remember her that bitch that slot now I Just wanted to share it with you. He said to the old Jewish crowd Wait till wait till he goes to one of those southern Baptist churches and he tells me that he was his father was black I mean he died when he was three he's busy. He's been spending a lot of time Check it out his family roots. Okay, maybe he'll find out his his and then yeah, and he comes to us out Florida Today's county and everybody finds out his father was Cuban hey it can be done his father was a philasha who braided to Cuba father. We're cool eyes in Minsk While the upper general support for a piece in the Middle East Park has been criticized for a vagueness on issues Was less direct on the issue He called the Bush administration's approach to the Middle East half-hearted city supports Israel's right to establish security through primitive strikes Uh-oh, but as for the fence being constructed by Israel and West Bank Clark caution You've got to be very mindful of the Palestinian's rights. You don't want to construct a fence that's going to be prejudicial to the ultimate of Willemu resolve the problems to negotiations. Yadiya diyadi Local them a credit leader said yesterday the turnout for Clark illustrates potential weaknesses for Lieberman's campaign and what was once considered a stronghold This demonstrates an opening for someone else to galvanize supports at state democratic Senate Democratic leader Ron Klein A Palm Beach County Democratic movement with Clark on Monday Palm Beach County Commissioner Bert Errant and a Lieberman support are Considered that the Clark turnout was impressive though we said Lieberman could match it Let's put it this way, Errant's and said I don't know Senator Lieberman's campaigns been disappointing or the other ones have just been better. Wow. That's an interesting way of looking at it, right? Sure Yeah In other words if a restaurant goes out of business it's like saying I don't know if their food was really crappy or maybe the other of our restaurants were just Better same Yeah, that's the good way of looking at it I don't know if our radio station was garbage or if the other ones were just better That's what the David Ross is always saying to PD Bulger. I don't know if the Clear channel station suck or if the other ones just happen to be better they suck and less They suck less. That's gonna be our new motto with QM.

Listen to this show even though who normal Kent is I'm sure the man Some sure that he's really depressed and morose I would have fact that I haven't gotten to his Something his fat newspaper story yet But I'll get to it His self-aggrandizing story about how he's gone From the hospital bed to a millionaire And how he's a big shot Got the eye But anyway, get a little bit more on that story About the U.N. what they said about the al-Qaeda Not good Not that we want to get anybody a little bit nervous up there But it's about time somebody started paying attention You mean we're not safer A lack of international cooperation And resolve his holding back efforts To stem the flow of money, arms, and supporters To al-Qaeda A U.N. report has warned As a result of the terror that we're blamed for The United States on the West's continued Let me try it again As a result, the terror that we're blamed for These non-loved attacks on the West's continuing to grow The U.S. in particular becoming a fertile ground Now keep in mind again Then Iraq wasn't a fertile ground Be afraid, be very afraid Be very afraid Be 40 march Iraq attack by the bush mice Doing his abandoned burying Nazis But now all of a sudden, Iraq has become a fertile ground Fort terrorism Yeah, they used to hold these opposed to be fighting But instead we're helping to create it Fending the flames Stoken a hornet's nest Poet were stoken and poking it The report released yesterday was compiled by a special security council Communists established a monitor international sanctions against al-Qaeda Especially worse in perdi-west-led forces in Iraq Oh my god The committee said that country had become readily accessible To al-Qaeda followers anxious to take up the battle against the coalition forces It's become like a maggot magnet Kind of like QAM, a maggot magnet Kind of like the Mohawari Davidicho, a maggot magnet Absolutely Right one It added the risk of the terror group acquiring And using weapons and mass destruction continue to grow Highlight and great concern over the possibility The group might stage an attack by using the so-called dirty bomb The committee headed by Chile and Ambassador Harold O'Munyo is monitored no relation to many Munyo's Monitorers the implementation of security council Resolutions requiring specific action against al-Qaeda Among the measures passed by the council Resolutions requiring countries to identify al-Qaeda-linked organizations and individuals Imposed travel restrictions freeze bank accounts And prevent other access to arms, etc. Munyo said a particular concern is that many charities are still being abused by groups Connected to al-Qaeda or the former Taliban regime in Afghanistan This is a very distressing fact he said Furthermore he added weapons continue to flow across borders on check and in large quantities Especially in the Middle East as a result of reports said al-Qaeda continues to have access to sufficient funds To recruit train and mount operations they're mounting it right now And he liked that Does this pathetic or why?

Bad PR His morale And that could for his reelection And it was a brilliant way to upstage Hillary 18 out of 447 Okay, here's the second pull And I realize I'm interrupting my fabulous reading here of this fabulous Michael Jackson story but nevertheless Pull number two In fact, we can say that guy the trouble going back to his other voice Maybe he's online too now, do you think? WQAM Hey now Yes sir Can I take a moment to touch a palm of story you read about the Panthers? Yes Just real quick because I know I don't want to kill anybody out there with this It is my firm belief and I know how you feel about it because you've said it already When they took the Panthers out of the division with the island, there's the rangers and the flyers I'm telling you it killed the crowd, it killed everything It really did it, it's boring Even though Atlanta is not right You don't think the fact of the team is not, and by the way Atlanta is not drawn flies I hate to be with our setting team, they're not drawn flies Correct But you don't think the fact that the team has degraded as such a degree that for the most part They've been non-competitive for most of the years that they've been a newer arena That's got a lot to do with it, plus the fact that it's not a hockey town You and all those ingredients together, plus the fact they never spent that ten million dollars from Pawel Bride That they've got to spend on margins There's not much of a draw there to bring people back Right, I can agree with that But we trust the constant increase in ticket prices Then went through the roof to where lucky got to pay 62 bucks for a good seat Right, all agreed, but let me just say this You still have some sort of a fan base here from people who lived in the northeast And now we're facing every time you go to that arena, you either see in Carolina, Tampa Or Atlanta, who is a craft of our own team? Or don't forget to hurry and wash them and catch Who cares about that? I'm a craft, yeah So I really, I really believe that that was the beginning of the end when they were taken out of that division I'm sorry, I really do Yeah It was a major hit for this team Well, when they survive or not, there's still a lot of hockey fans down here But other than seeing the Panthers, there's nothing else that comes here Nothing I know The Rangers come once, maybe the Bruins come here once And that's it, done And the rest of the season blows It's horrible, it's a shame And the arena's beautiful And I sure hope that people keep this in mind even though I know they won't And I don't want to pee under a parade in date, county with their Marlon stadium But keep it in mind, all that garbage about wane And if they build a new arena, they're going to have all this other revenue And they're going to be able to compete and all this other crap They've made the playoffs exactly one time since they've been in this new arena It's highly unlikely that they're going to make it again this year And you know, who wants to pay for it? I agree Have a great day All right, buddy Go, we go Hey, okay, sure Hey, we still got a team All right, first place in the division briefly anyway See, we got sidetracked on hockey there But that was good We've had all good calls to the atonia That you know what did it? What did it? Joe Rose I think you're right Joe Rose at 9.59 this morning Joe, we love you, baby sign that contract, sign to deal He's waiting When he ripped a moment and asked It was kind of like the green light That was the signal to the entire South Florida audience That everything is okay I say is proceeding post hast High school and Joe Now that we got Joe in there with us, see, unlike for real Which we love for real, it can be wrong Now that he's got can, I'm not going to like rip him an ass Because that would be incency But he didn't know who his friends were And there was Mo and I would try to influence him One way the other could say whatever he wanted But he just, you know, even though he did say Mo show blows, which he's right about that But Joe ain't going to pull any punches about the Mo man Okay, so Mo, if you think that what was that term he used to get about About In spite of the tractors in our own radio station We can't imagine who he was talking about there Right He got that five point Let me say again, this is the same son of a bitch that went on the ear And encouraged his listeners not to listen to the show that follows him last year, last summer The year goes summer Which to me, I never heard of such a thing I never heard anybody on a radio station anywhere in the universe Go on here and say, I urge you not to listen to the station of the show that follows me Or this one, whoever heard of such crap Even your good friends back at IOT like Dick Farrell And Alex Bennett that never stoop to that They never stoop to it because it's not done, it's just isn't done It's kind of like a Mo ought to be done, you know what I mean? That's a good one Yeah, done, well done Cook them well done, okay Anyway Well, I don't know how we're getting sidetracked from this very important stuff But the guy with a hockey call was good, I'm glad to see that there's somebody who cares which is good And number two, I want to get again tip my head to Joe Rose Not that I'm sucking up with Joe, I don't need to do that because we get along great He is a little bit of a backstabber, but I don't know why I say that, I just say it because I like doing it, you know? Why don't want to suck on somebody Anybody too much of an endorsement because then it's like, it sounds insincere Oh, he hates that, sir Yeah, or this audience can't stand that If they think anybody's get along too good, then they're kind of like suspicious Like, you know, like the Beast in France, they think there's something a little bit going on there Is it?

But they always picked some of it like Paul Newman When he turned 85 or something Oh, the sexiest man in the world thought it kind of silly The shaken mom decided it was time to leave But the source claims Michael made some comments That the frightened woman interpreted as meaning he would not let them go She stayed put for hours convinced he was being held captive She felt a little like Patrick McGoon on a bad day She managed to slip out during the night Then she called the house and told Jackson that she was going to call the police If he didn't let her children leave You can't keep us prisoner she yelled Jackson let them all go Soon as she said she's going to call a police, let them all go As the relationship with the family deteriorated The glove one took off the gloves and made preparations to defend himself he contacted Scott Peterson's lawyer Mark Garragos During a session with his therapist this past June The boy began talking about Jackson's alleged behavior And the therapist informed the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's department Which began investigating sources be saying The psychologist was alarmed When the mother was informed she was in shock shattered She asked the boy over and over again if it was true Remember okay in the godfather is it true Michael is it true The insider says the boy insisted it was true was a shocking realization The police pro-commonated with 60 officers raiding neverland out of him or 18 And Jackson being escorted to jail and handcuffs to remember the 20 Before being released on $3 million bail he vehemently denied the molestation allegations But the singer still has to face the music Officials are convinced there are at least two more victims And they're hoping they come forward to reveal the source of the investigation Another inside source is police are also curious to hear An if Jackson who has a history of prescription drug abuse Used knockout drops on the alleged victim did you know that? That he had years of prescription drug abuse problem right no You do now As part of their raid they were looking for medications They had questioned the mother of the boy before it before hand extensively about drugs The Jackson may have used under some they also spoke confidently with other parents of kids who were neverland around the same time as the boy Said the inside source in June 99 The inquirer revealed the Jackson of an abusing prescription painkillers even receiving some doses from an intravenous drip Give her have an intravenous drip No Jackson's alleged fascination with Polaroid pictures that children came to light ten years ago In the lawsuit filed against him by several of his body guards. It was alleged in court papers that Jackson instructed one guard to destroy a Polaroid picture of a naked young boy And an astounding may bias former personal mage. She said she's seen Polaroid photos of a young boy by his bed The recent raid a Michael's ranch concentrated on photographic evidence and medications they neverland employed Polaroid in cryer During the search they cleaned out a medicine cabinet all of his prescriptions were gone They took home videos that were in his master bedroom. They also took cameras, but the source disclose that police may not have gained access to a secret room above Michael's bedroom It's access to a passageway that is a couch TV and bean bags chairs in that room and appears the police missed it bean bags chairs Yeah, throw it that nothing if you're gonna molest somebody that at least be comfortable We're sports radio five six Yeah My God, you will have reached all my ethnicity And I keep children alone And they leave inside my path He goes, baby, I am gay That is why I married you, we are so worried It's great to come and say, with this song That's really bad I will never give up Played it on my child And I know those toys that I never had You need to write so in my mind What my dream had I been seeing, yeah If for you touch me I call me free Let me find a home I'm safe I believe in all my child Oh, we're fine 14 at 5.60, come take a look at who's tied with a mole monster We might actually have a bat-lawner hand today See that?

No Which we don't have it, but we can get it for tomorrow, can we? Maybe What do you mean, maybe? Maybe Why would she allow us to robber to get it for us?

Okay Jack or his lost Vegas boys only blow out when and out blow it out But anyway before we do that This we just were at the beanbag chair point, okay? That's right For the most part, the police were throw out of the source they even turned over a vase Or is that vase in the entry hall where Michael used to hide candy? Those SNM, I mean, M&M's The source told the inquiry a great fine for the investigators would have been a logbook Kip our security at the main gate, all the kids that passed through our entered into this logbook A decade ago Jackson escaped prosecution on several charges involving a 13 year old boy By reaching a 15.3 million dollar settlement with the youngest of his family This time around the same set of our registered attorney Thomas Snedden said The victim of the alleged acts who turns 14 this month Was cooperating in that he would testify against Jackson However due to his health problems, it remains a question if down the road the uncance or Patients will be well enough to testify in court The child's family is not seeking monetary damages said Snedden Should I be that paragraph again because Mark Erdogus is running around all they want Is money there? Much of great robbers The child's family is not seeking monetary damages It's then nevertheless said in the insider, Jackson defend his own preparing to show the Youngstus mother as a woman who's ultimately out to bleed Michael for money Right A major part of the defense will be that the woman and her son saw revenge on Michael Their benefactor when he long no longer wanted to support them in luxury They'll show how Michael's help and kindness enabled a boy to get his cancer into remission The singer will be a range and where the ninth Jay I thought was December 15 Err Sneaky push knit back push knit back The singer will be a range and where the nine predicts he'll be exonerated Lies run sprints but the truth runs marathon Jackson said the truth will win this marathon in court Michael said Now Alcohol cigarettes and two weeks of parting at Jack O's laws Vegas boys only blow out At the morage and it wasn't just a morage There is a picture of him with a SARS mask that's the only thing I can imagine that this is It's I just I'm looking at this thing.

Sure, he wants to take good care of us He always we're always hearing about oh he loves the children and you know Booze and cigarettes And something about packing Somebody young students came and went at the villa that some of them ever had a sleep in the bat Tubbs And by the time the 45 year old star left the villa to answer molestation charges in California Just as a young party mates had racked up 25,000 dollars in property damages to booty It was a 24 hour boy party hotel A 24 hour boy party a hotel inside and declared During a rare foray from the villa, Jackson drew up at the art diviniets art gallery With four youngsters He had one girl on three boys in the 12 to 13 year old range with him when he arrived at my store Said gallery owner Barbara Lee Woolen The kids were following him pointing at things in giggling Michael wanted a $6,000 dollar bronze statue of a bare chested boy looking at the sky with birds on his arm Which is pictured right here by the way The inside of the snow is Michael's Vegas trip was a continuous blowout for himself And his underage mailed guests I know he's being investigated for child molestation charges in Santa Barbara But his recent behavior with minors and laws Vegas should be looked into as well It says There was no apparent adult supervision for any of the kids who came and went They came and went Michael made a clear to the hotel stand that he was the only person outside the boys allowed to enter his villa The kids even ordered booze and cigarettes off a hotel rooms service menu The hotel's room service menu Get that I got a month. The items I saw delivered to the villa were absolute vodka, crown roll whiskey, Bailey's lacquer and Marlboro and Marlboro lights cigarettes In other words They were puffed on faggotts in there Well, maybe those were all for Michael How many faggotts do you think were in there? About third man Michael was decked out in full makeup It wasn't just a little bit of foundation but heavy showgirl makeup He was wearing very thick pancake on his face along with black eyeliner Are you sure girl? Whenever I saw him, he was wearing the same purple grey and black silk pajamas With two sets of buttons at the top. He looked like a geisha girl And Michael seemed to exist in his own spaced out world I felt like Michael was completely out of touch with the day-to-day reality The day-to-day day-to-day Oh, did I mention speaking of that norm canon as a sort of newspaper they expressed? We'll get to it, maybe Or maybe we can tease it for tomorrow Because everybody's hanging on the edge of their set Hey, by the way Norm, let me $50 million Okay, go to think he owes me like a fortune now Right?

That's what you told me See you just keep stretching it and stretching it. Yeah, I'm so nostalgic. Snap anyway getting back to this Vegas business at the Mirage. There's just not there's not a whole lot more of this because then we got a lot of important calls to get in plus we got that story about the bullseem Huh, we'll get to it three boys who appeared to be between the ages of 12 and 14 checked in with Michael and stayed with him throughout his 16 day visit the two bedroom villa Michael footed the bill for the villa villa one which was $4,000 a night while his staff occupied another three bedroom villa at five grand a night a lini room at 1500 a night and a hotel room at just a mere 500 bucks a night Oh, chum change Michael at his entire entourage went by the last name of Parker His personal chef was Mrs. Parker his driver was Mr. Parker and the three kids plus all the other kids who came and went all season the name Parker What are we gonna do with the broad Parker outside Two Michael's three kids were African Americans and one was Caucasian one of the African American boys seemed to be drunk much of the time he slurred his words The white kids stood up because his mannerisms were extremely feminine The three core boys were a little more polished than the other young boys who would chew up randomly to visit and kids seem more like street kids are runaways When the street kids showed up at the Marage they would remain behind closed doors and Michael's room for a few hours then leave It was strange because you never see these kids twice use them and lose them Or as a co-use them abuse them and lose them and whatever the new kids showed up additional room service orders for food alcohol and cigarettes would be called in Michael was the only adult allowed in a router fellow one he must have been drinking a lot of booze and smoking a lot of faggots, you know That's right handfuls of them. Wow Michael was the only adult allowed in a router fellow one the housekeepers at the Marage complain that even the maids were not allowed to enter the entire time Michael was there There was no one allowed in to clean up and became a mess The kids shrub trays with dirty dishes booze bottles cigarette packs and pop cans outside the door and let them be picked up When Michael and his party chat, let me ask you this before I finish these the last part of this How come we have to read the inquirer to find this out? Why is the mainstream media which all of a sudden has gone from that initial feeding frenzy to that OJ like a bronco thing on a highway? How come they've gone from that to virtual silence now because the president because Mark Jericho said we're gonna come down on anybody like a elephant on an ant if you know You think no Then why aren't they telling us all of these things because the president's trip to England is over oh and his surprise trip to Iraq with his turkey When Michael and his party checked out of Marageville a one looked like a bomb had hit it The carpets and a poultry on the chairs and couches and the bed spreads were all ruined with stains and had to be replaced And a number of prescription pill bottles some unopened were left behind in the trash heap The destruction inville a one was so bad that the hotel actually videotaped through as Michael and his guests have left it The hotel made arrangements to send a bill for $25,000 in damages to Michael's manager Because there's only one queen sized bed per room where everyone's slept during Michael's stay was a mystery until he checked out At that point hotel staff discovered blankets and pillow stuffed in the villa's bath tubs which had obviously been used as makeshift beds by some of the boys Michael's young guest also had access to the hotel's expensive shops and boutique shops and seizures palace and treasure island inside a reveal The kids were allowed to purchase souvenirs clothing toys games whatever the hearts desired Among the items delivered to his villa were two stuffed white tigers from the Marage I wonder if what him belonged to Roy We got a story on him by the way he's doing a little bit better he went He went He went The other day Two white scum tigers in the Marage lifeside statues of Humphrey Bogart and a buckingham palace guard and a slew of video games The villa was turned into a combination arcade toy store and kitty cocktail lounge Where were the parents of these young men reign to mystery just to come to Vegas to shoot a music video for his latest single one more chance How appropriate He'd hired 500 extras to work on the video, which is being shot at the CMX Sports and Entertainment Complex near the palms resort There were lots of kids hanging around Michael throughout the shoot Half of us in underrated boys were always hovering near him. I remember Jackson's honorage disclose Michael seemed very upbeat. There were no indications he knew when arrest was coming No tell on side or at it. I found it very disturbing to observe Michael's boy banderate is Marage villa The fact that these boys were there seemingly without parents of any adults in provision was wrong At one point I was tempted to call the cops because the whole situation seemed weird and inappropriate to me so he said Okay, okay, and there's a couple of other things. I need to just think about his the kids father the accused the kids father very strange But anyway, it goes on and on and get this way. So in choir, okay, the December 9th issue Jackson victim's story is on a cover Tax band who auction off bullseem and seized in Florida Well, what else are you going to do with it? Miami US tax and customs agencies more than 5,000 tubes are frozen bullseem in during a Florida drug investigation We'll auction off later this month.

How is it possible at none of the people that we added on have got any votes? Barbara Walters don't have any Dave and horn Paul Harvey and Dan Marino don't have any I mean the vote totals are increasing but how come they have none the big oh? I don't know if this small potatoes. Can you explain that to me? I cannot. Maybe they're on my thing here. Let's go to the regular home page, okay? And make sure that those are showing up on there because I'm sure that Eric wouldn't be a dick in a row with us, what do you course that? Because it is a labor of love. I just want to check underneath screen and look who's on her looking a lot better Roy. No. 24 is the vote total and those four people are gotten on they have an report. What? I just thought reloaded it. 287 Dave had an event horn just got one. Well it's about time probably his wife Now here's the question of the day Oh, high-opanels starts probing the fatal beating. Now I can't believe that one guy we had caught earlier hadn't seen it on he must watch the comedy channel all day I think they were showing it on there too. He must live at a cave. I just don't get it. How anybody could not have seen the 600 pound I mean the 250 pound guy 600 to 50 who was really been a cook after dipped in chocolate and now he's dipped in Schmidt. Let's see him no more Subit in watchdog panel born from riots that followed the shooting of an unarmed black man in 2001 is looking to another death This time a black man died after wrestling with six officers trying to subdue him and like I said everybody who's out of the cave Has seen that video over and over and over again. In fact speaking of the K-L-Bushella Assamacena. That's right. It's got a lot of money. Now Daniel Jones 41 died at a hospital shortly after being taken because they Sunday They 350 pound man was struck repeatedly with night sticks in the confrontation captured by police cruiser video camera The cause in the thing. Well Jones death was under investigation preliminary autopsy and I wonder remember all the riots of course in California Or rather a king incident and I'm certainly not defending the cops who beat the crap out of rotten a king But number one he survived and number two we turned out to be a bigger scumbag than the thought he was right He's sued he got all that money and he still turned out to be a scumbag Or I got arrested over and over and over again Am I right? That's he right who are I am The cause of Nathaniel Jones this death is still in investigation preliminary autopsy results show he had in large hard his blood contained cocaine and PCP or Angel does Both of which can cause erratic behavior.
