Okay, now see, I mean, let's get to one or two at least serious things. Obviously the audience has got a bug up. There has not good. I like that. I'll speak in a dangerous bugs. Yeah. The dangerous strains of cholera black fever HIV polio and hepatitis may have been lost during the postwar looting of Iraq's key disease control facility ABC News has learned this morning. The US military is where they may be used as weapons. An exclusive report on ABC News Good Morning America, Brian Ross Viel that scientists did bag that Central Public Health Laboratory are worried that an unknown number of viruses have been stolen. They say looters took refrigerators full of the deadly viruses Friday but they're not sure exactly what's missing. They're in containers. All of these things taken together. cholera aids in black fever one unidentified Iraqi woman told Ross. Not just one or a couple, not just two or three. Of the worst of possible things in a world but all of these things. Ross says US Marine showed up at the facility today. US sources are concerned that polio and hepatitis may have been stolen in addition to other viruses that may not be reflected in the official records in bag dad Ross said the Iraqi scientists say they have no idea who took the material. They don't know whether it was swept up in a looting rampage or taken by somebody who knew what they had. There is great concern and anger from the director of the lab about the failure of the US event of looting. God are we doing a good job, you know what? Between the library and between the museum and now the hospitals. The Americans shouldn't just protect or here comes the key line of the whole story. The Americans shouldn't just protect a ministry of oil. They should put it all the general public health services. The lambs directed to Ross. The written sign outside now reads an Arabic stay away extremely dangerous. Live is polluted with viruses Ross said there have been no reports of illnesses yet and the greatest danger maybe it'll looter who took it in the wrong hands however could be a potent weapon. Very important weapon. So I guess if we're concerned about finding weapons of mass destruction maybe somebody else found some. Yeah. Not that we want to get a by nervous.

Warning we have mercilessly taken a following material out of context without endorsement or permission from those depicted is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent look as ridiculous as possible. We hope we reach that goal or at least major like Dr. Philly's on daily. I'm not even remotely qualified. Oh I didn't know that. Expect cycle be able and buzzword with no meaning and no purpose. Let's go to your calls for Dr. Philly. Sure. Does down Ohio? Hello. Hi. How are you? Fine. Okay guys, what's the question? Yeah, I've been married about three months and my wife and I just had our first little argument. And what do you think I should do Dr. Philly? I think pull the trigger on the voice real quickly.

As a matter of fact, let's take a look at the schedule and see if any of our people are taking off for good Friday. So you know, but you took off for a pace off. Pass over just not that kind of a holiday. Right. It's an eating holiday. Oh look at that. What is that all about? The Humphor is off tonight where we got Joseph Gacky between three and seven. You think the Humphor is taking off for a good Friday? Is that could that possibly what that's right? Possibly. Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! Oh my! Oh we're sure you got a lot of Joseph Gacky lately. So I wouldn't be too optimistic for when that book comes out month and clearance. I wouldn't be too a whole my hopes up too high. Got some two pieces of great news for the one guy that called yesterday. Can't you see anything good about this war? Well, this isn't really good about the war because there is nothing good about the war, but and if you notice that kid Ali about how he's now like a superstar. Sure. He's under he newscast and thank goodness he's doing so good. Lucky. Oh brother. Just tears your guts up. And keep in mind he's one of the ones who turned out better off better off. I maybe. Terrorism threat level drops from orange to yellow. With the war and Iraq seemingly near and end the Bush administration lowered the official terrorism threat level today. Meaning yesterday. Top administration hates how the decision to reduce the perceived threat yellow for more. It was based on several factors. Maybe it was based on the or rally factor. They include the military progress in Iraq and assessments by intelligence analyst that the chatter in terrorist circles has subsided. Lot less chatter. You notice that? Nope. Oh yeah, just put your head out the window. You don't hear that. What do you see here? Yeah. Chatter. Nevertheless, announcing the lower threat level, the secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Rigid, warned against complacency. We must be vigilant and alert to the possibility that al-Qaeda most sympathetic to their cause, as well as former Iraqi regime state agents and affiliated organizations may attempt to conduct attacks against the US or interest abroad, Mr. Rigid said. By the way, speaking of organizations, how about the spokesman? What are I talking to the sweep? They got the broom shot and Brian Marie's mighty duck swept the redwayage last night, four games in a row. Nice going, Brian VM. Too bad all you phony redwaying fans in South Florida. Lease lost in overtime. Third overtime. Any bell for made 70 to stops. Of course, the three he led in were put here, but nobody's going to talk about those. They'll say, wow, wasn't he great after he led in the first two really bad goals? And I'll say, yeah, he was great. But didn't he rate? Nothing's perfect. So there you go. We're back to yellow. So everybody's are stand down just a little bit. Okay, you want to stand down? Okay, don't you love that expression? Yeah, what does that mean? The only military for the saying that I like better than stand down is, you like that one lot there. Oh yeah. Speaking of that, let's have a big who all for the big catch. Sodoms have rather the five of clubs, five of spades? Which one is it? Five of clubs like I said. You want special forces of captured Sodom whose veins have rather a senior former Iraqi government figure in the late night swoop in Baghdad. The snatch came as intelligent sources revealed that several key former Iraqi officials may still be hiding inside Iraq. Are you facts about me, crap? Yes. Wow. Must be important stuff because my facts machine, my facts machine just made these big clunky. In fact, it's still the one it must be really heavy to do this stuff. Oh, that's a kind of good thing. Might in the same pizza is the WD for what me worry. Right. I think we ought to put that on there. Don't add it. Are you adding it? I'm adding it. What me worry? What come on me worry? I like that. Although let me say it again. Don't ever call them Alfred. You know what again. I think you're going to apology to Alfred if you do that. That's been my consent feet. Not that. Let's see George White stupid man on our microwave bush says J and Tampa. Oh, what's going on over there in West Coast? We got people in Tampa and St. Pete. We might even start getting some response from South Florida pretty soon. Don't go crazy. Aw, you never know. Tampa St. Pete. Okay, Lutz will be calling next. So anyway, this is a set of clubs. I mean, the five. The five are clubs. Bizarron, Abraham, Hassan, Altik, Kitri. Altik, Riti. If you haven't. South and South rather than former senior presidential advisor was captured by a team of special forces by US Marines, Brigadier General Vincent Brooks told a press briefing in Qatar today. But there's a sad as little piece of bad news. What the other I do with it? About how they couldn't find all that all that important documentation. Did I print that out? Yeah, I see. I totally. I've got too much stuff here. Too much stuff. No, seriously. I've got 45,000 different things here today. I can't keep track of any of it. There was all that stuff. All these important documents and somehow and these big houses that they rated and they were all laying around like Sonam's all his little black book and all of his girlfriends and wives and head hunchos and terrorist connections etc. By the way, that Abu Abu Abbas Malpateh is. If we have time, we go talk about that. Abu Abbas. Oh, but that's the proof. We're going to be disconnected with terror. Guess what? Abu Abbas. Oh, the world is buying that. Let me stir. Got a very good shot up. Big story here from the BBC. Carlos slap him on the side of the head. Okay. He is already. It's not even 930. He had already out of control. God did we have a good time last week. Anyway, somebody mentioned Tim Robbins and the speech that he gave to National Press Club and it's on our website. Is that on our already Carlos? No, very soon.

And I have the transcript of the speech, which is I think a little bit too long to be the whole thing on here. Don't you? Well, I really don't care what you think. But I'm there's a couple of pages here that I am going to get to. A lot of reading that a lot of bedtime stories. I don't know some people get upset about that because we don't get as many of the really good calls. And we don't know what to freaking bad. As the booze boards said on the on passions or they will say today too. I'm bad, okay? It's just you have to see it. And then of course the clowns are going crazy too. And what's his name? Charlie.

Are we up the day to stay inside? WQAM? Woody? WQAM? Witty? Witty? Warmonger? That's a good one. We already got Warmonger. Witty? Yeah. Warmonger and white bread. I think white bread's not too bad, actually. Yeah, there you go. And uh, I have about a Jennifer Lopez George with Carmen Lowe. That was great. I loved it. I loved it in the car. It was great. Okay, see you. You're watching J. Lowe now. It was on South Park. They were making a perfect turn. Oh, J. Lowe has invaded South Park. Oh, they shredded her. Are you fucking carrying me? No, it was hysterical. Okay, I've been enjoying it. It wasn't as good as passions with the Abu's born. I guarantee if you saw it, you'd craft your pants. I'm telling you right now.

Will most accurately depict? It says, what movie do you think will most accurately depict life in 2000? What did I say? Most accurately depicted. We used to slap him on the other side of the head now for me. Please Carlos. Here's some obvious starters and suggestions. A million years BC sleeper escape from the York planet of the Apes Road Warrior in Swailand Green. I mean I appreciate the effort there but I think it's kind of weak. I like it, you like it? It's a good idea. I think it sucks. I'll tell you what I'll save it for next time you're on. Okay. So look at a calendar now. What is next year? So Tim Robbins writes or he didn't actually write this. This was the transcript of the speech he gave to the National Press Club a couple of days ago. As a matter of fact, it was two days ago on Tuesday. I'm not going to read the whole thing like I said it's too long but he's with the concept has always been a popular target. I remember when Columbine high school shooting happened President Clinton criticized Hollywood for contributing to this terrible tragedy this is we were dropping bombs over Kosovo. Could the violent actions of our leaders contribute so out of the violent fantasies of our teenagers or is this all just Hollywood and rock and roll? I remember reading at the time that one of the shooters had tried to enlist to fight the real war a week before I acted out his war and real life at Columbine, I talked about this in the press at the time and curiously nobody accused me of being unpatriotic for criticizing Clinton. In fact the same radio patriots that call us traitors today engaged in daily personal attacks on their present during the war in Kosovo. Today prominent politicians who've decried violence in movies the blame Hollywood as if you will recently voted to give our current president to power to unleash real violence in our current war they want us to stop the fictional violence but are okay with the real kind. And these same people that tolerate the real violence of war don't want to see the result of it on the nightly news unlike the rest of the world our news coverage of this war remains sanitized without a glimpse of the blood and go and flick to the upon our soldiers or the women and children in Iraq. Violence is a concept and abstraction it's very strange. As we applaud the heart-aged realism of the opening battle scene of saving private Ryan we cringe the thought of seeing the same on the nightly news we're told it would be we were our told it would be pornographic we want no part of reality in real life we demand that war be painstakingly realized on the screen but that war remain imagined and conceptualized in real life. In the midst of all this madness where is the political opposition where all the Democrats gone long time passing long time ago. With apologies to Robert Burd I have to say it's pretty embarrassing to live in a country where a 5-foot-one comedian has more guts and most politicians. We need leaders not pragmatist that cowardly for the spinsones of former entertainment journalists we need leaders who can understand the constitution congressmen who don't in a moment of fear advocate the most important power directed to clear war out to the executive branch and please can we please stop the congressional sing-alongs. In this time when a citizen we applaud the liberation of a country as it lives in fear of its own freedom when an administration official releases an attack at questioning the patriotism of a legless Vietnam veteran running for Congress when people all over the country fear reprisal if they use their right to free speech it's time to get angry it's time to get fierce and it doesn't take much to shift the tide my 11-year-old nephew was shot kid who never talks in class stood up to his history teacher was questioning Susan's patriotism that's my aunt you're talking about stop it and the stunt teacher backtracks and began stammering compliments in embarrassment. Sports writers across the country reacted with such overwhelming fury at the Hall of Fame that the president of the Hall of Fame admitted he made a mistake and majorly baseball this about any connection to the actions of the Hall's president a boy can be stopped and so can a mob it takes one person with courage in a resolute voice. The journalist in this country can battle back at those who would rewrite our constitution in patriot act too or patriot the sequel as you'd call it in Hollywood. We're counting on you to star in that movie journalists can insist that they not to use his publicist by the administration the next white house correspondent to be called on by a reflicer should defer their question to the back of the room to the banished journalist do juror and any instance of intimidation to free speech should be battled against any acquiescence or intimidation at this point will only lead to more intimidation you have the elected and not an awesome responsibility and an awesome power the fate of discourse to help the republic is in your hands whether you're right on the left or on the right this is your time that us and you have chosen. We lay the continuance of our democracy on your desks and count on your pens to be my dear millions are watching and waiting in mute frustration and hope hoping for someone to defend the spirit letter of our constitution and to defy the intimidation that's visited upon his daily in the name of national security and warped notions of patriotism. Our ability to disagree in our inherent right to question our leaders and criticize the rations define who we are to allow those rights to be taken away out of fear to punish people for their beliefs to limit access in the news media to differing opinions is to acknowledge our democracies defeat. These are challenging times there's a wave of hate that seeks to divide us right and lift pro-war and anti-war and the name of my 11 year old nephew and all the other unreported victims of this hostile and unproductive environment of fear let us try to find our common ground as a nation let us celebrate this grand and glorious experiment that survived for 127 years to do so we must honor and fight vigilantly for the things that unite us like freedom the first amendment and yes baseball. So Tim Robbins for the National Press for our enthusiasm. I've gone Tim I've gone baby because you are a little bit correct. How do you like that? I like that a lot. I'd like to I might read it like 45 foot or maybe not quite 45 maybe only. 21 until 10 a Q a m. You're a bad. Yes I am. We'll argue just her. The news today I asked you out you said no way. The week ends here. I'm alone. I'm horny now. I grab my phone with all my old friends. You're hand in a close air. Up and down. You think God for the rest of the world would come on over. I'm 43 at 5.60 WQM happy a pass over happy a good Easter happy Easter happy uh one else. That's a good Easter good Easter well that's but tomorrow's good Friday and a good Easter and a good good. All the same polycrap. I don't say that you can't say that. I just did because it's true. Here's a good one from Dave and Lakeland weasel. Let's get that on there. What do you say? I like it. Wish I could change by vote. All over you apologize to the one who died on Moes 4head. But that is a weasel in it. Let's grab or a durable Muscratch. He's doing a Muscratch ramble. I could just see that. Can't you see it? Moes doing a Muscratch ramble right in this video. They're with guilty uh playing the flute. Here's Stuttaring Giller home. It says George Wasting taxpayers money bush. It's a little bit uh unlike untidy yeah. Oh thanks for any wise Stuttaring Giller. I want to piecekinda Stuttaring Steve that calls a Mosho every morning along with one and Lou. Here's an interesting piece from the UK mirror newspaper. US pay off army leaders. Many of Saddam's top military hedge bin were secretly pay off and airlifted to save havens by US special forces as Baghdad fellow was claimed last night. The double dealing Republican guard leader Mahir Sufi on order his division laid down their arms after the US agreed to take him by Apache helicopter to a secret location. I phone is ringing again you know what that means. Booker Brian's dismount either. I'll die. Iraqi troops around Baghdad had sought to wait before the US advanced dumping huge caches of arms and the streets behind them. Details of the CIA's dealings were kept confidential as the Iraqi capital fell for fear of reprisals against Saddam loyalists as other negotiations took place. A military source that US Central Command and Qatar said yesterday the fact that the coalition was able to make these deals not we took bad bet with surprising ease. Now you're starting to understand why they went in there with like nobody there. Yes virtually no organized opposition. They cut some deals you know. I'm not how many bucks they had a pay to get these generals to a coal S. The U of the W and George Bush stands for we got the pull up there already. Workless 13. Wonderful nine. Woo out of 44. We got nine who say wonderful. Man a warm longer for white bread three. Reckless with the W three. Warp three. Worst three. Wretched appear. What me worry too. That's what I voted. Wasted two and length doesn't have any yet. You can't call the president of Wankania. Unless his name was Bubba. No, it's seriously just like Tim Robbins says when Clinton was in there and who is being just excoriated not only for his sex life but every every time he farted it wasn't the right flavor and he made up every kind of story under the sun. I mean it would just just brutalizing me guy who basically and I'm never stole a freight train like Michael Moore said he did a lot of crap to do make no mistake about it. His hands were mighty dirty when he left but nonetheless everything is relative. But the point being that we got eight million different sarcastic, caustic satires on Bubba in here was there ever a complaint was there ever a complaint about the jocelyn elders bit. Oh no. And last time I checked he's a hell of a lot darker than condolisa. But boy once you start messing with this crowd man with the ghost peppers we have taken control of the country in a bloodless cool well was bloodless to less business happened right then it's a different story it's a horse of it in color. Now we're going to get you off the air we're going to because they want they want one voice they want Fox News on all and they want clear channel on all radio and Fox News on all TV stations and that'll be it that's it that's all you need to know all spin all day unfair unbalanced tilted far to the right so far that your TV like your TV would look like the leanies how our pizza. And I'm saying you'd have to like put supports on it on the right sides we didn't tilt over. Yeah I think we're being freaked by the way. Are we? Why do you say that because wonderful just passed from like nine to seventeen. That but you understand there's 65 oats on here and 51 of them are there see there's only one positive category. Carlos slapping like on a forehead now. Yeah that'll do it. Why is it that you're so slow since you came back I think North Carolina kind of slows you down what does a lot where you did come up with something good all you came up with a stir from ABC that was very good because I didn't know none of them about the botchallism in the color we're on the HIV and the the uh oh. Now we're too busy are gardening the oil ministry we don't have time to wear about all these other things. Oh there's something very very wrong something really smells bad. I didn't see 60 minutes too much now I was watching hockey I'm so sorry but you said the Dan rather actually I did a couple of things yet they did a little warnings we warn you the pictures you're about to see your little because they were talking about the mop up operation so they went into a hospital and how they don't have supplies and here's all the children with the uh blown up faces and no eyes uh etc Well long overdue of course now that's all things over where I guess it may be a little bit late although it's something to think about for next time next time yeah next time like Siri the W and George W voice dance for worthless 15 wonderful 14 that's 21 and a half percent so you see at least 78 and a half percent don't say so wonderful. If there's some other positive ones be feel free to my uh call them in I have no problem with that but I couldn't think of any other positive one W is just a strange initial for a strange guy uh war

world's are one disappeared too something really strange going on here at QM maybe we're being sensitive anything it's possible I remember playing it if we had anybody let me just tell you this if we had anybody in a market who actually really wrote other than some bitches of being a DJ on live 100 again or some silly thing like jick or wrote a defunot of his column this morning but if if if ham or Glenn Garvin of course is a real right wing or anyway or a Ken back to his visiting a sports lady now if there was anybody in a market wrote about radio that whole story about condolisa and fox news and the whole all that stuff that went down that was a major story in local broadcasting of this past year there wasn't one word written about it and of course God forbid anybody should write about the chilling effect that's going on how about how and right wingers are trying to get all the rest of us off the year now we don't want to write about that because we don't want to give that fat fat any more publicity don't even mention my name if you want i'm not looking for publicity it's not going to help especially now we got the nifty billboards up but my report on it but uh you know and and this is what you do with because most of the people were writing about all the stuff just like Glenn Garvin you read his stuff in a hero and he starts pedaling his right wing bullcraft two right there when a guy damn instead on the editorial page is he's editor analyzing on a guy damn uh people page which supposed to be fluff so like I said good luck to myself and now I'll just hear the TV presents I like the information of a sir Camel Fuka and we are this close to defeating the great infidel americans once again they are not even in our act they're not even close to back then they have

10 out of two or five sixty wdqm the US campaign to the sir massiri are prompted a hospital response from Iran and Egypt yesterday with both suggesting Washington is doing Israel's bidding and it's going comfort with the mask is ready for that yep I think the Syrians were pretty clever actually to come up with a deal in the u.n security council short off put a resolution in there to get rid of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East of course that would include not just Israel and Egypt and Syria and Iraq and Iran but also Indian Pakistan you think they're giving up them noo I don't think so I think Israel's given up their 200 noo don't think so but Israel says he's thinking about it I'm thinking about to them settlements you know we says he'll let you know after pace off speaking of religious crazy people like him pedigons preacher earth's Muslims in a move angered the angry some Muslims the pedigons good Friday service will be offered by an evangelical preacher who dubbed Islam very evil and wicked last year and army spokesman says irrelevably small number of Muslims at the Pentagon felt the invitation was inappropriate because of Reverend Franklin Graham's past anti-Islamic comments but Lieutenant Colonel Ryan Yanthis says Christians at the Pentagon at astrograim and the Pentagon tries to accommodate the worship needs of all religious groups. Yes, you know that separate Muslims services are scheduled let the Pentagon the same day because Friday is the Islamic Sabbath Graham was heavily criticized for calling Islam a very evil and wicked religion in an interview with NBC not long after the terrorist attacks on the American Washington he wrote in a subsequent Wall Street Journal column they doesn't believe Muslims are evil people because of their faith but I decretting the evil he said that's been done in the name of Islam or any other faith including Christianity said why don't you sure a lot of that you know man I believe it's my responsibility to speak out against the terrible deeds that are committed as result of Islamic teaching he wrote singly singly after repressive treatment of women and the absence of religious expression in some Muslim countries you know thank god that the Catholic Church is all those women priests right right in fact not that we want to get into like a pissing contest but over the centuries throughout history in course Islam's been around a very very long time but throughout history which religion has a massacre the most innocent people good question which religion has made more people an offer that they couldn't refuse Christianity oh he also said that the persecution of a elimination of non-Muslims has been a cornerstone of Islam conquest and rules for centuries and it's been made other comments attacking Muslim for lack of religious tolerance what a guy Graham son of famed evangelist Billy Graham recently sparked fresh anger with plants this and Christian relief workers into Iraq when it war ends that's right we're gonna go over there and all those townheads all those impidels will convert them well bring them to Jesus baby can you imagine the money they can the dinars they can break in they can sit around have some good dinars together you did see that now they want to put the mercenaries in here because they said the dinars worthless right now why is that why is it worthless because of cause of us Samaritan's purse the really phagency handed by Graham is poised whereby shelter water medical assistance inside Iraq as soon as military clearance is available as American and ally troops roll into Iraq Samaritan's purse has a well equipped team already on the ground in the Middle East ready to help thousands of suffering families in the name of Jesus Christ these demon on a group's website says holy cow the was in the said that he that was bad so you gotta no matter what you say bad attendia well it's close close by Jesus Christ also that some Muslim groups believe Graham has ulterior motives given his past viewpoints people are suspicious about his real aim which could be to take advantage of a situation which people are desperate said hold on Hassan a spokesman for the council on american is lunar relations in Washington they'll have food on one hand in a Bible the christian Bible and the other a spokesman for Graham's group said religious issues might be raised we do not not deny the name of Christ can isics of Samaritan's first told new house new service Jesus Christ right we believe in sharing him indeed in world word

It said, this is a very, this is by Andrew Gumball in the New Zealand, Harold. It's a very good time to be alive if your Rupert Murdoch. He's just realized his long-held ambition to break into the US satellite television market by the market leader, direct TV after three years of torturous negotiations with its own original motors. His cable news channel, Fox News, is commodity a rat war stronger than ever. Having overtaken CNN with its hot blood and rabble-rousing style and differential approach to the Bush administration's every move, it came out as the top-rated cable station news are non-news, and 36 of the top 40 timeslot from March 31 to April 6 perhaps more significantly and maybe transforming the way Americans get their news in times of crisis. Murdoch's long-running campaign to deregulate the media landscape could soon come to fruition in the US thanks to the FCC and its chairman, Michael Powell. As early as June Powell's second son of CUS Secretary of State Colin Powell intends to loosen or possibly dismantle entirely to a cornerstones of US media regulation, a ban on cross-ownership between newspapers and television in the same market and a ban on anyone entity controlling access to more than 35% of the national television audience. But I just tell you before. That's where it's going. Powell is keeping his exact intention secret which is upsetting powerful senators and prompting calls for a proper public debate before any decisions are made. It may be that Murdoch having relieved newscorps' coffers of $6.6 million for direct TV is not in the best financial position that they can meet the advantage of more relaxed ownership rules. But the US has become an extremely congenial place for Murdoch. His agenda seems to fit hand in glove without a demonstration and he seems to be on a role that others struggle are struggling to replicate. Anyway the other of column here by Annie Lawson and the Guardian. Group reverse fox network is among the US media giants accused of tearing its work coverage to create favor with Michael Powell. The George Bush appointed Chairman of America's media regulator who was facing mounting pressure to scrap media ownership rules. Foss together with network heavyweight CBS and NBC is pressing the US FCC to dump rules that provide a TV broadcast to affroning another network or radio TV station and newspaper in the same market. Under the existing one we already did that. The Center for Digital Democracy and On-Provid Agency in the US that promotes diversity and digital media believes news organizations in the US have a serious conflict of interest when it comes to reporting the policies of the Bush administration. Mr. Murdoch has been criticized for imposing his pro-war stance on all newscorporational media outlets. Like the New York Post by the way. His on-priorled support for President Bush has also raised eyebrows about his timing of his purchase of direct TV. It is likely that decisions about how to cover the war on Iraq especially on television may be tempered by concern not to alienate the White House at Jeffrey Chester the Center's executive director. These media giant stand-and-make untold billions of the FCC safeguard our eliminated or weakened. You following this? Yeah. You're wondering whether they're all do stepping in a line? Mr. Chester accused the US media of adopting a narrow-minded commercial mindset reflected by their failure to effectively analyze and criticize the Iraq War policy ahead of an impending ruling by the FCC on the media ownership regime. And I'll go as well. Just pass that along for your information. Just like that. And Congress, they're all sitting back there, you know what they're finger up each other's comb but. Wopass, I do like that one a lot of putting that on a roll. I'm like the way they spell it. I'm spellin' WHUP-ASS Wopass. That good one? Got it. George Wopass, Bush, baby. Let's whop some ass. And there's some other ones on here, can we? Wako, do we have Wako? No, no, no. I said it earlier. Yeah, I think. Well, I had Senator. Are you pardon? You guys did have it. I wrote on the list and I said it to Eric. Maybe he didn't know. We had a Wako? All right, put it on Eric. Wako, don't be less of these guys. Just put it on there. Okay, follow orders. Dr. Goodwill be near soldier. Wako. Weener, did we put weener on there? Not yet. I like weener. That's what I heard. Wofel, Wofel's good. These are all good on this list. This is pretty good list to ever sent us in. We'll fill in and we can be gone. So what do we got now? Well, I'll take a look at it. Five, six, seven, oh, but we got a heavy plate today, baby. A heavy plate. God, lots and lots of stuff. And I realize I'm changing the world here, right? No, I'm doing the best I can. And little tiny Miami with all those mosquitoes, the size of bowling balls. Although at least we don't got no, do they have it? What? The, whatever that diseases I was talking about before not SARS, what's the other thing? No virus. Well, let's not a virus. Do not much of that there, right? I haven't heard. A few dead cats, but hey. I'll probably tighten our relations with the Chinese. WQAM. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes. I just got back in a couple. Conpower Sun is ahead of the SEC. Yeah, Michael Powell, right? Chairman of the SEC. And what was the job before that got his job? I'm a year-per-din? Why was his job before his father got that job? McDonald's. Climb through. Drive through. Good luck, you pal. Yeah. This guy's a little bit slow to catch up. He's a fine's very amusing. Yeah. Michael Powell is the son of Secretary of State Colin Powell. He is the Chairman of the SEC. He is one of a handful of powerful people in this company to solve whether we can say crap or not on the year. And let me see it again. I'm better whisperer because, you can't say it no more. Don't say that in half. Stop it. Throw on you people. Yeah. There you go. We said crap three times, Michael. Michael, Michael, motorcycle. So that's why I pretty much you got America speaking with one voice. That's why you got some justified people. I don't want to mention no name. Are you sure? Yeah. Who are like goose stepping in line? Feverously, hysterically, fading over backward doing like summer salts, turning into a human pretzel. They're generating so hard to try to like goose step in a line. And especially if they have anything to do with cheap channel I mean, I, you know, something as much as beastly we all know about visely and about Greg and about this screw-up company which it is. And the fact they don't like to pay anybody on time, but but can't say too many good things about them, but you know what the best thing about them is? What? They're not clear channel. Well. So I want to kiss the counter here and I don't want to say nothing good about Norma Kim because then he'll be calling me. And don't call me up here in Norma. You really bug me man. You drive me nuts. You're depressing. You're a permanent downer. Fah, fah, fah, fah, fah, just get out of here. If I want to hear bop-a-bap-a-gang, I have room or call. At least you know is hockey. But at least I kissed the ground that I'd decided to sign this deal as opposed to that the packs and thing which would have been sold over to cheap channel. Oh. Back in the arms of Pete Boulder, we're getting an aircraft of our business on lunatics over there. David Ross. I wonder if he's can't eat any of the antirross. That's a good point. Rosanna Dana, you know. Surprise me. I'm sure he had related to Walter Ross. Or Red Ross. 24, 11 at 560 WQM.

You got out of the UK. Where the bag is. You're. Oh my god. Every guy can change the news. We never yellow my head. They got to play. They got to play tonight. But if you name it by. Which we need. And we have no problem with you. Like a yellow light. We have a yellow light. Can't explain. What these white people win. With the dead of the tent. Hey, hey, don't run away. One can jump down to the lake. Have a yellow light tonight. Something they catch a fire. We have a yellow light. Of the light every time they pay. They're you are going on. We have a yellow light. Of the light every time they pay. You do understand the reason that we have this whole morning light system in the first places. Because it's a perpetual way to keep us involved in and psychologically glued to the concept of war. We're a perpetual war. I thought it was just stuff in nonsense. No. It's it's part of the a sci-op steel here. Psychological. A control of the American public. Like that word. Yeah, sci-op. Science and Cyclops. Said we could one I'd most remain. We can't go to the public. But anyway, that's what it's all about. Because we have to be concerned about that. So in the back of our mind, some people in the front of their mind, maybe in the middle of what used to be their mind. Like me. I mean, it's always we're always conscious of this. Well, we're in a perpetual state of war. Just like James Wolsey says, we're in WWE 4 and it's going to go on for the foreseeable future. So all of us are dead. So therefore, whatever they do, this this prepares us for whatever the hell they're going to do it excuses us. So we look the other way. And naturally, of course, manipulate those poor results and manipulate. Oh, and I want to tell you something that might want to rip a real ass. I want to tell you right now, you know, Lou Dobbs on CNN who used to be on CNBC, you know, Lou Dobbs. He's an asshole. I want to tell you right now, I was so pissed off last night. I emailed them, which is only the second time my life ever done it, emailing CNN. And I'm not that it makes any difference because they're not going to respond. They never do. But I just had to get off my chest. He had Bill Schneiderrunner to got the poster from CNN who's a good guy. He gives it to hear the numbers. You know, about pop abusions, a support after a Gulf War one was 98. 86% and this one at 73% and it's not as high and any shows the breakdown upon Republicans and Democrats. And our Democrats top abusions had like 80% and this bush has only got 60%. And Bill Schneider goes on to talk about these facted this bush is much more divisive and much more a right wing politically. And Yadiyadiyadiyadiyan since they once had you got on the berth first day has been that way. And as a result, the most Democrats have got a tremendous disdain for him. The Lou Dobbs mean while continues trying to reinterpret the results and trying to get Bill Schneider to say something different. And he's saying, well, but you do realize that 60% of Democrats, especially at a time when I mean Bill Clinton was elected by only 43% and we had Ross Peroback then a 60% is still a very impressive number. And Bill Schneider says yes, but the number isn't going to last very long is that it will be my prediction because of the fact that now that we're back to the nuts and bolts, the economy and all these other issues, the domestic issues, that's going to come to the forefront just like with pop of it and Lou Dobbs just relentless. Well, but you know, I'm one of those people looks at the glasses half full rather than half empty. And I'm thinking to myself, don't you understand what you're saying? Yeah, he does. Don't you understand what you're saying? You're saying that if his approval ratings are higher somehow that you like that better and it's good for America. I mean, how blatant can you be? Why did you just put a guy then bush buffer a sticker on your forehead? Lou, you idiot? Got all mighty. He's an asshole. Who of course is part of that whole charade again of the, you know, the gambling network business? A dollar a dollar a dollar, you know, buy some stock rhymes with Schluck. Oh, brother. I just, I was fooling at the mouth. I was just so rabid. He's he's done that before, but this was way over the top. And I'll give Bill Schneider credit to his credit. He's just kept repeating the same thing. He said, well, you know, he said you can call whatever you want, but he says I believe very strongly that these numbers will come down significantly with the passage of time. And Lou did not want to hear that. His eyes, they're rolling around like a pinball machine. Somebody wants to know if we had the article about the Peenack on our website, yes, we do. Thank you for your facts. And also we have another article on the project, which is even better, but much too long. Way too long for me to read on here, but I will read a couple of paragraphs. So it's going to be a taste from information clearinghouse. The project for the New American Century says information clearinghouse by the way, and the other logo is news you won't find on CNN. And they are. Especially when an asshole Lou Dobbs is in, who's almost as bad as Wolf Blitzkrieg. I said, and in fact, in my email to CNN, I said, only Wolf Blitzkrieg, and I spelled it though. Only Wolf Blitzkrieg, it seems Lou Dobbs in his enthusiasm to suck up to the bushmongers, the bush, whatever I call it. The project for the New American Century, this is an article by William Rivers Pit, that was written February 25th of this year. It is, no. New York Times bestselling author of two books, War on Iraq, and the greatest submission is silence. Okay? He's a high school teacher in Boston, Mass. He says, the people versus the powerful is the oldest story in human history. No pun in history of the powerful wielded so much control. And no pun in history is the active and informed involvement of the people all of them did more absolutely required. And he is, the project for the New American Century, or Peanack, is a Washington based think tank rated 1997. Above all else, Peanack desires and demands one thing. The establishment of a global American empire to bend the will of all nations. They chafet the idea that the United States, the last remaining superpower, does not do more by way of economic and military force to bring the rest of the world under the umbrella of a new socio-economic tax-americana. Remember what I called it before we're going to export democracy then what they wanted or not right? The fundamental essence of Peanacks ideology can be found in a white paper produced in September of 2000, entitled to be building America's defenses strategy forces and resources for new century, which is what it talks about in that other article. In it, Peanack outlines what is required of America to create the global empire they envision. According to Peanack, America must reposition permanently based forces to Southern Europe, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Modernize US forces, including enhancing our fighter aircraft submarine and surface fleet capabilities, developing to play a global missile defense system and develop a strategic dominance of space, Star Wars, there's a trillion dollars again, controlling international commons of cyberspace and increased defense spending to a minimum of 3.8% of growth domestic product up from a 3% currently spent. And it goes on for pages on it like you can read it on a website the project for New American century by William Rivers kit, a relation to Mickey Rivers or Brad Pitt. Here's another good one for our pull, Raffle with the W. Raffle as in Ratham but with the W. That's our pull today on neorodges.com. We don't take too many pulls on his show, but.

His mentor. Hey, go up those check it pants. A mole myster. Fred some of those calls on the most show this morning. He's right. He don't get any crank calls.

So what if a good calls or crank calls or whatever day are we urge you to call him to communicate so he'll feel loved and wanted. WQAM. Hello. Yes sir. Yes. Who you call? He'll. Roger. This is me. This is old Neil. Oh sorry. Pick it up. Don't be sorry. I'm just doing screenless lately because we feel like it is more so. I'm sorry. I couldn't forgive all of the cell phone. Let's see control TV. Of course. Not cable. Not cable only over the year TV. Well, how come they're letting them get away with a bullshmit on on TV, but not on the radio. On where? Channel 10 in white PD Blue. They're doing that in white PD Blue. Yes sir. And we're going to check on it. We're going to check on it right away. That is a polishman. It has been doing it this the whole season. I mean they started with an off air character that said it's not yet heard it. But I said I had to be wrong. But then and that's a network show. Yes. Yes. That's not a cable. I mean that's been doing it with the shield and now it's lucky. But that's channel fan. You're right. Well, at the very least I'm going to start saying she, I anyway. Okay. She, I. Okay. The file is a no. Thanks for a good news. See there you go double standard and why PD Blue on CBS. I see it here from the CBS guy. I because this guy just out of them. They're saying volgement on here. See in the news shows. Although they don't do that very much in the US. They even bleep that out. Here on the CBS. See them. Is they could have left the statue and they couldn't have left. I don't be talking about this. And on the BBC. Forget about it. I mean it's in here all the time. They just leave all the words in. But only for just a few minutes. I guess they don't say it for too long. There's in somebody might hear it. And it must double stance all over the place. You know, this I've said it for years. Nobody ever wanted to agree with me. They think I'm too radical. The idea of the FCC as the word police. It was never invented for that. The FCC was created by the federal government to regulate the technical aspect of broad castations. So everyone would have a chance. So everybody would have an opportunity for the signal to be heard. And it's a lot of different situations to like where it is. Nobody would in would jam their signal. Nobody would like put too much power on here. If you got a you know, license for a 5,000 lot station. He wouldn't crank up 50,000 watts. All would be nice. But you know, that's that's what it was for. And nothing to do with content. Right. The FCC has got no business. But in the 50s and in the 60s. As well as like Jesse Humbs is about the right wing lunatics. They decided to like sick the FCC on broadcasters. So that we can have. And then of course it all blew up in 72 or three would a George Carlin WBA. I think. Yep. With a 70 rewards. And then the FCC decided they were going to be the word police. And don't you dare whatever you do. Don't you dare say any words that we decide arbitrarily. Our bad words like mother and all those other ones too. Like you and those. That's another reason to watch passions today and watch the abuse boards, man. Worth a price of your mission. 10 57 at 560 WQM where we swear a lot. We're going to be here early on.

Every time you put the orange on your head you got to put your lip and shut up because of her. And like you say, you step in line. But, actually, I don't know who the hell we're going to get up in there. But, somebody else and I know more than four. If I were to say, you know how to do that. Thanks. No more than four.

And I'll sit here and listen. You guys eat. Because I got a weigh in. I'm, again, one more warning for the beast. If you don't even waste your time coming into Marff, you're going to be, if you're not doing anything. If you're not like doing it, just get lost. My patience room. I saw him just before I left. There's matter of fact several days ago. You know what you look like? I give up. A tub. The war according to Fox. Here's another in a series. This is from TomPain.com. Sharon Vasco produced this piece and Michael Ryan a former correspondent editor for Time and Publications. Who's covered conflicts in her island, Granada, Grenada, Panama, so the Southeast Asia as well as the first Gulf War. Gallatin, Gateway, Montana. Do you know where that is? Nope. Need to do it. It's in Montana. It ain't, maybe it's near Shelby. Roads. This is how learned a lot about journalism while I was traveling in Montana this month. In the Boseman Daily Chronicle, one morning I went and up at Peace by columnist Tamara Hall who Gushed over a Navy sea-lux-assized to secure an Iraqi port. I watched the remarkable maneuver on folding on Fox News, she wrote, I was overwhelmed by the heroism of our Consultors and the efficiency of the American military. Fair enough. Then she complained that NBC did not cover this particular story. Instead, the reporter complained that President Bush wasn't watching the war on television, she wrote, his arrogance motivated me to push the remote button. CBS didn't cover the story Hall went on. Instead, Dan Radder blathered the overwhelming majority of American people have now swung around behind the American soldiers. Radder was well aware that support from military action had remained above 70 percent for months before the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom. His dishonesty motivated me to push the remote button. ABC and CNN fear equally poorly in her judgment. The mainstream pressies every opportunity to portray military victories in a negative way she wrote, they speculate and manipulate and he reculate. This was only the most coherent and unspoken expression of a sentiment I heard in my travels. The pervasiveness of Fox News and he's got news in quotes as a definer of popular opinion has never been more apparent than during this war. According to a TV guide, Paul Fox News shepherds Smith tied to leave beats of the cable anchors including CNN's air and brown in popularity. Young, ribbon, good looking, Smith seemed to have become the voice of the Bush war for most of America and Fox News view of the world has been adopted by much of the nation. It comes as no surprise that there are conservatives in the big-sky country of Montana, although the copper miners unionized you more than a century ago and people still remember Joe Hill. But the fact that in some places I stayed wild driving through the state I couldn't find CNN and in a few places couldn't even find all the broadcast networks was a surprise. Yet Fox News was always there. In the opening day of this war coined the LA Times and average of 4.4 million Americans got their news from Fox 3.7 million in get information from CNN just 1.9 million in from MSNBC. In his book Harvard and the Unibom were the Montana author and former philosopher Professor Alston Chase documents how a series of myths and misrepresentations about the trouble life of Ted Kazinsky worked their way from one reported to another until after numerous news broadcasts and newspapers stories fiction started to be accepted as fact. National Networks quoted national papers quoting national magazines until the legend became more interesting than the news in this war Fox News has created the legend will be tied networks that try to report the news. Along the Idaho border I fell into a conversation with two men who were expressing the kind of attitude the polls tell us most Americans feel they were intelligence successful local businessmen mature people who didn't seem like warmongers, but when the subject of the war came up they spoke with an unmovable conviction. We've got to get that guy one of them said he's a bad guy. We've got to wipe him out said the other. These were not rednix, but responsible people community leaders the sort of citizens whose sponsor how a cleanups and fundraisers for local hospital. They had no question about the correctness of the war. As we talked in a quite serviceable stake in burger place I couldn't help but notice what was on the TV at the end of the room. Fox News. The same Fox News that was playing in the lobby of the hotel I stayed in in Bill grade Montana the same Fox News that was playing in the lounge of the hotel I stayed in south of Boseman. The Fox News philosophy had permeated not just the media but the culture my heart sank when a young woman a member of a feminist art collective commented I think we need to do this when we spoke about the war. Fox News has become the engine that drives the legend heroism on questioning patriotism and valor and during do are the order of the day ask whether the war is justified if progress is stalled if civilians are dying and you are if Miss Hollis to believe arrogant and manipulative. In middle America George Bush may be running the war, but Fox News is writing the script says Michael Ryan Lathontley and that kind. That's a good line George Bush may be running the war, but Fox News is writing the script. 1113 at 560 WQA and if you ever thought about getting you a wireless phone like most smart people do, I'll show you how.

The Harvard graduate here in Voices in his head and then one day he was feeling kind of weird. He moved to Montana and flew himself a beard. Crazy that is cycle path strange. Well the first thing you know to begin to prove. Can folks said jazz has to you to bomber do. Said California's where the trials on a piece. So they're loaded up the shack in. We can't believe. Exhibit a jury board. Where's. His lawyer says that says the craziest. If you don't believe in just read his manifest. Well now it's time to sing about it. And his defense, he would like to thank you folks for paying the expense. You're all invited back again to disco Calle T, to buy the first edition of his autobiography. Soon to be a movie, HBO. Jerry Springer. Okay, no step on me again. 11-18, get out of here. At 5-6-2-Q, here's a couple of fanczes, including one with the venom. Look at the handwriting on here. Yeah, it's like about 110. Cronic. Is it? Yeah. Well, we'll get to it. Here's what it says if your listeners to your station are sport holes, why it's supporters of our pressurary for your device, bush holes. Or just assholes. Mike Oxland thinks Bush is a wussy. I don't know about that. We, we'd Mike work on it. I got another one I want to put on there. Okay. Want to be dictator. All right. I'm not pan, huh? What do you mean want to be? He ain't yet. He's working on it. He hasn't completed it yet. We're still planning on other election next year. We haven't called it off. Yeah, you think. Have and I said that haven't I predicted that? And if we work to these people, there would not be another election next year. That's what I've said. Uh-huh. Wonder boy as then you always wonder what he's going to do next. That's cute, but I don't think so. Cute. Now let's get to this facts. And let's learn what it's all about. And we'll preface it by saying, come on, baby. Come play with these titties. What you'll understand at the end. You sound desperate when you use Tim Robbins to justify your anti-gulf war to ideology. I sound desperate. I don't think I'm desperate at all. I think I'm in pretty good company. In his pathetic rant Robbins accuses a Southern talk show host of encouraging his listeners to murder war protesters. We both know what this is low to crap. Well, I still have the original story over here. And I did read the entire thing as opposed to some people. And as a thought-see, where is it? Do you hear it? I've teach you in another nephew school as far as to wearing a t-shirt with a peace sign on it. And a friend of the family tells the listening to the radio down south as the talk radio host calls for the murder of a prominent anti-war activist. I don't doubt that for one moment, knowing the venom in these psychosis that comes from right-wing talk radio, which is most a talk radio, don't doubt it for a second. So even the sumits below the crap I'm not buying it. I have a feeling that whoever wrote this squarely appringing on here, he's probably the one that's got a real crap-trip problem. It's just like most Hollywood actors left or right, Robbins is an emotional basketball case and can't stand to be held accountable for his feature behavior boo-hoo. Well, what does that mean? I have no idea. I can't stand to be held accountable. It sounds to me like he's standing here for what he believes in and just repeating the same thing again. Your anti-war position is as extreme as a rally's pro-war position, neither is that interesting to hear day after day after day. And add breast and you and your parrot George could be mistaken for Randy Rhodes. Come on, baby. Come play with these titties. And it's interesting. They've spelled roads two different ways. Neither one of them even close to me. Right? Ha ha ha. So add some breast. Come on, baby. Come play with these titties. I'm playing with one right now as a matter of fact, the squeezy ones. Nobody would call me Randy yet. Somebody did say I lived in. Ha ha ha. That's just closest I got. Somebody said I was pretty Randy. Hmm. Don't forget to booze horns on passions this afternoon to a clock on NBC 6. It's a must see show today, the all-time best passion episode. Even if you don't like the show, if you haven't watched it before, you must see it. Even if only to see Julian Crain was Ozzy Osborne best. And the scene starts out where he's trying to put a, he's trying to put a garbage bag in a wastepast of mines and winds of stuck head first in a wastepast. It's a beautiful thing. WQAM. New. New. Yes, sir. Does it sound like me? How about we taught it? Ha ha ha. I like that. That's the winner. And what fun likes it too. Thank you. Hey, it's late. I'll be coming off. Well, no, I mean, you got to be quick with me. You know, man, I got a quick finger. Are you like we targeted? Yeah, let's go. I'd like you cut him off by the way. Why? I think he was going to say, what did I ever do to you? I think that was a. No, Carlos, now you know the guy. First of all, he always calls online nine. And secondly, that guy's got like a deeper more, he's almost like the whispering guy. The guy would have, then this guy was neck guy. This was a good guy. No one like so many people in our fine audience hate you like poison. No wonder the week that you run vacation, they were like dancing in each other's pants. They were like squeezing it all week long. You've got to like lighten up a little bit. You're always assuming the worst, okay? Well, just keep in mind my philosophy, okay? Prepare for the best and expect the worst. I mean, I hear how I'm spelling it. W EE-TAR-DED. We targeted. That was excellent. I love it. Oh, I wish we'd had that earlier. I'd have hoated for it. We targeted. Stuff to make me want to play some number of fudbits. I didn't want to have it. 560-50, 560, pound-560 on a yell. And by the way, this big deal about Abu Abbas and he's supposed to be the link to terrorism. Well, the BBC says, uh, no, it's not a serious everybody else. Seen several stories about this. Abu Abbas is a throwback to an earlier generation of Palestinian fighters who carried out spectacular attacks of hijacking around the world of drug tensioned their cause. His capture is being used by the West's evidence that Iraq was harboring international terrorist. His fate presumably prolonged imprisonment despite Palestinian demands that he'd be said free. We'll be an example to others in the current climate post 9-11. Also the Italians want him. They want to make him an referee can't refuse for the killing laurel. Turning our blind eye to anyone who has a record like his and his group did murder an elderly disabled man is not an option for US administration, but he's not quite the big catchy Americans are seeking. His arrest is a piece of unfinished business and not a break to an war on terror declared by President Bush. He's not the link between Iraq and Al Qaeda which Washington has been seeking to establish he comes from a different era. Abu Abbas ended up in Baghdad because there was nowhere else for this aging militant or terrorist leader to go. He and his kind of an partly overtaken by the New Zellots from Al Qaeda Hamas and Islamic Jihad who are motivated by religion as well as nationalism. Even Israel allowed him in and out of Gaza a few years ago as it accepted that he'd given a violence and was supporting the Oslo peace process. Israel couldn't prosecute him under the terms of the Oslo Accords anyway. Oh wait, I don't, I won't confuse us. See that's another thing about these fascists we have in there. No matter what treaty it is that we've signed or entered the whole rest of the world as we don't do treaties. We don't do treaties. Another Palestinian Abu Nidal, the most famous in his day for Acts of extremist violence in the manner we checked in any settlement with Israel, also ended up in Baghdad. He was found shot dead there last year. The weather by his own hand as the Iraqi suggested or fans of the Iraqis themselves for some reason was never clear. Abu Abbas was from a time when the West Bank and Gaza were wholly under Israeli control and Palestinians could not carry out the tax inside Israel very easily. Instead they resorted to action internationally across the Israeli borders. The Palestinian liberation front which of Oslo was a little known fact even at the time, but it was quite often daring and once he was hanged gliders to get into Israel from Lebanon. In its most notorious action, the hijacking of the line of a killie lure on the Mediterranean 85 is now mainly rumored for the murder of Leon Klinghau for an overly disabled New York Jew who was shot in his wheelchair and thrown overboard. Oh, Abu Abbas made an apology of source later saying the shooting had been a mistake. Give me President Bush to make an apology to little Ali. You think? I'll hold my breath. Anyway, the murder did great damage to the Palestinian cause internationally was one of the events which eventually grew with the Palestinians to change their tactics and open talks with Israel about a two-state solution. What will become of him is not immediately clear, he'll presumably be sent for justice to Italy. I can't, I just can't restrain myself, okay. Justice, we must go to the current opening. Well, I must be a, who's in Italy, hangin' out, where he was sentenced to five lifetimes in absentia. The attack ends at let him go when he was fighter planes forced down an Egyptian aircraft in which he was traveling after the hijack ended. They were forced to make a man's after widespread protest, so even a let him go. The days of those kinds of quiet releases by government-sikking aboard holding on the inconvenient prisoners are over. Says this article by Paul Reynolds, BBC News Online, how do you like that? Well, I'm a small potato, as nothing to do with Al Qaeda, as nothing to do with international terrorism today, but you believe whatever you want to believe, okay? And you want to know why? Cause they reported it breathlessly on Fox. As whole, hey asshole. At 5.60 WQAM, we just can't seem to get the morning show right, so once again, we softly advise about our crackhead chicken often salted, and we apologize for that too. And now, 5.60 WQAM proudly presents the Morgan David show. One and more? That's a good question. I know who I am. Morgan David? Yeah, that's good, you say. I forgot who I was. If what you name again, tell you. No, tell me. But you can call me, tell me. I'm in this dish. Fox. Look. What a baker. Two-shopies. Stop. Take it back. I want fish Nova. That's all. That's all. Get that out of here. And while you're out, get me coffee. I got a punch card full here for school, can't I get a free cup. Devil, wait a minute. I'll eat the both of the talk about sports. Oh yeah. I'll have a tell you about the time I had lunch with Joe Peppotone. No. How about that? How he can shuffle board team. They don't have that no more. I'm a big friend. Since they got rid of the rocket board, she's on Carlin's Avenue. Oh, it's a good thing I bought the normal Jean rules. Oh, oh. I'll see the card. Yes. Bracken, man. Cracken, man. I got you. Crack, right here. Bam. What was that? I flip my wig. Pew. It smells bad in here like totes. That's a very nice remote from the festival flea market. Sounds good to me. Yeah, they got a lot of nice matches there. Oh, okay. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. Hey, let's go. Can you smell the vacation? Oh. Happy a pays off y'all. And it's 11.30 at five. 16 also to Lynn. Lynn, even though she's in Vegas, still can't get off the email thing. And she just does a subsets with a show. She says, she likes to call W. President death. Also says, having a great time leaving this afternoon didn't want anybody but eight like a pig. That's the way to do it sweetheart. When it not work it off, this is a grotesque story about the empire. I'm sure you saw this being the worst fan that you wanted. This is sick. Yeah, again in Chicago, no less. A fan came out of the stands during two minutes, getting between the Ross and a white socks. And a tack for space on par last Diaz. Security and players came to Diaz's aid and the fan was quickly taken away. Immediately after Carlos Lee flat out to write to Andy eighth inning. The fan ran out of the field and tried to tackle Diaz. Rapping his arms around the empire's legs. Kind of like precious was doing to Luis on passions. It was the first appearance by the Ross and Chicago since Coach Tom Gambo was pummeled by a father and son who came out of the stands last September. Now certainly you remember that story. I do. I remember this one. Those two Yahoo Rednecks. Oh, daddy and his young clone. Three times earlier Tuesday, night the game was delayed when fans ran on the field before being tackled by security guards. U.S. Senator Field, formerly called Kamiski Park will host the All-Star Game July 15. That's on promising. Before the game, Gambo had tried to downplay as we turned to the field where he was attacked a month ago. I haven't really given it a thought. He says lightning doesn't strike twice. A wrap. Yeah. That's what Luke Christie said too. Wow. Oh, there you go. Just the totally out of control of all the empires that I could have picked to attack. There's so many fat overweight. Yeah. Empires that are out of shape. That guy's a Marine Corps reservist. Who was the upper who died with a heart attack? John McWiz the John McSury. That sounds familiar. Remember that a couple years ago? Yeah, right over here. Collapsed at home played before again. I mean, he was a good on par too, but he waited about 800 pounds. And then who's the big fat black-compires? He's still working? I don't want to see him. I don't want to see him. Kind of system to make him lose weight before he could have put her in system? What the hell was his name? The big fat black-compire. Who waited about four. And then he lost a bunch of weight and then I think he gained it back. I think he was like a darker complex darker version of the beast. What the hell was his name? See, this is bad when you remember that. Although I do remember Francis O. Here in mildered, oh, miliar. Miled guitar was German beetle. And were German beetle? No. I knew. He was the eighth beetle. You better get with him, Mr. You don't know your harness drivers for cramp. You better start studying on his stuff. You probably think Rosemary, oh, myster is a home, more myster. I'll get a book. Yeah, get a book. Dick Feinberg alone at two. He gave it a little instruction. It's called the Ali by Harness School of Life. Hey, Chevron, Texas goes to company that some people love to hate. And recent years, protestors have figured that the world industry giant for range of perceived defenses ranging from human rights abuses in Nigeria to World Contamination and Ecuador to refine repolution enrichment. Now, Chevron, Texas, go ahead and add the war in Iraq to a list of complaints. Several hundred demonstrators decided on the firm's San Ramon headquarters. Monday to accuse the company of encouraging the Westwood tax item was seen as the way to gain access to his nation's vast oil fields. And we are guard-grating that oil ministry with everybody's life, but the rest of the stuff include, in case you missed the beginning of the show, I don't want to get you nervous. But there's a whole bunch of toxic stuff. Whole bunch of crap that disappeared from that big laboratory, laboratory. Maybe Bella Lagosi was over there. You know, that's another thing about that video. A channel I got. I don't know if they got to wear Rogers thing on her be they. What? Hmm. You're a patient. Can find the wall loaded with hundreds. Look at that. Don't worry kid there, Dinar is there with crap. And what is land order? And we can take it on the drive and movie channel. And Dracula is a schnobie. No him. He almost got maximum kill. There you go. Say. Too bad you don't have the good thing. Oh, you don't have the CBC. You don't even have the BBC on your crappy, uh, direct TV. But of course now they're rubber murder codes. Oh, yeah. And you have his fox. Every channel now in direct TV is going to be fox. Anyway, Chevron texted us. No contrast to drone or rack, but the protests are going to leave the firm as sure to get them himself. So was, his Bush's National Security Advisor previously served on Chevron's Texture Gold Board. The company even named a ship after Rice before she joined administration once she arrived in Washington, the ship raised some eyebrows in Chevron Texture Gold took her name off the tanker tank. There was nobody wanted to ride on the old con Belize. They were pretty good to get seasick. Five, five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. The W. and George W. Bush stands for that's our pull question today. 468 votes so far the W. stands for wonderful 75. Ah, he's wonderful. Look at Breath of Fresh Year. That's only 16%.

And we got good Friday tomorrow. Easter Sunday. Get all those little eggs. Oh you know what I do like and you're just poison poison. And I noticed Kentucky fried a song like Big Buckets Up and I have no idea what it has to do with the chicken. It was a Cadbury eggs. Oh yeah. Oh. I could eat those and of course I don't want to say who my house keeps going out and buying them and leaving them around for me. Need like pounds of them because they're going to kill me but I can't stop eating those. You know how many I can eat before you even start stopping and short. Yeah. And then I start giving a second wind. You know the ones I'm talking about. I do they're great. They're great. Oh, dangerous. Like how old is that? Yeah. There's a lot of crazy about the marshmallow rabbits and all that I can look out that. The small Cadbury eggs. Yeah. Which of course they certainly have here. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. Not for me. I can't be doing that anytime soon. I'll tell you that. Yeah. Thank you so much, Miss Andrews. How's Brian Andrews doing? He's fine. So the great news is Rick Sanchez coming back to tell me the tale between his leg. Right. Yeah. What a surprise. Why we would think that before MSNBC would have hired him because they were desperate anyway. They got like nobody watching. But when you think that they would have watched some of his work from channel 7 and realize that he was a supercellious hyperventilating clown, I thought that's what they wanted. Who squats over the map? Well, didn't work out too well. Now they're moving on the other direction. Now they got that good right wing or Joe Scarborough on their night. Oh, have you ever seen him? No. Don't. And what ever happened to Jerry Knoxman? That big huge guy that was like sweating up his thermo 8600 pounds. Jerry Knoxman with the bald head. I give up. That was on the head. I don't get that. No wonder nobody watches that thing. Although I did play somebody audio this morning. You thought it was the CBC. She was asking some pretty balls. He questions there. They're going to get her ass over at that broad. It's she's on a rolloff. She's good. But they're going to nail her ass if they find out that she's questioning a third question. This effort of ours is glorious. Freedom effort of the US. I don't know. Eric Donald rum spelled him company. See the reason the audience don't dislike him that much. Is he's he's funny? Yeah. Just like here, my hearing was a blast at a party. W to Q a m. Don't talk the nail. Speaking sir. Deal. Yes I am. You have a great one for you. The way that the W represents for me. Okay. Why? That's not bad. Why? I like it. That's okay. I got a nail. Thanks. I mean, it doesn't work on our pool, but I do like that. Why? I don't feel like it. I was a great. It's good. I think you're pretty. Jackie Bales. I was Jackie Bales. Yeah, it was. Well, how do you remember that? Because I was there because she did it because I heard Rick Sances. Well, you said about him when he's, say Rick sucks in Jackie Bales. Five six seven. Five six seven. Five six. Five six. The only AT&T. Probably we're talking about Rick Riley when you said that. And I work saying right. That'd be a good pull question. Who did George just like more Rick Riley or Rick Sances? Huh? I only had one conversation with Rick Sances. Yeah. He was a big fan of mine. I don't remember you used to run around with his Sony Walkman. Listening to me. Then he started driving. You should have stuck to run it around Rick and not driving because you'd drive and could have, you know, kept that guy alive. If you would have been driving normal. Of course he probably would have run into him anyway. You know, probably would have hit him with his Walkman and given the guy, can's, hey, how's Dr. Bob? Do we don't hear any more about that? No. Anybody got any info? Any updates on poor Dr. Bob Ackens? Who was in a coma after Fawn and that's a horrible story. 72 years old and pretty good health considering. Considering all that meat and fat and he falls down and sits on a sidewalk and hits his head on the New York Ice several days ago. A couple of weeks now, I guess. He's been in a coma. Maybe he'll make a miraculous recovery. Now, if you think they're probably feeding, I'm sure the feeding him intervenously. Obviously, that's the only way. You think, you know what I'm going to say? No, no, no carbs. No. 560, 050, 50, pound 560 on the AT&T and that's to your lie. I apologize for saying that. Don't I? No. Even he would have a sense of humor about it. Sure. If he could. WQIN. Welcome, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you? I'm doing great. So glad to hear you get off that, getting off that bush and getting onto some hockey talk. Mm-hmm. There was a little pun fit in there somewhere. Yeah, right. I just, actually, I was listening to you talk about Ackens. I think what happened is right after they announced that the Ackens cult there circled the wagons. And they stopped giving out updates on that story. But it's pretty wild that that happens as often as it does. I mean, a lot of people, certainly down here, might not be aware of how often older folks do slip up north and end up in the hospital for that. Are you picking on me again after my fall and Amsterdam a couple of years ago? I don't know. I didn't even know about it. Oh, yeah. Broke a hand in my wrist. I didn't fall on my head, though. Thank goodness. Well, see, Amsterdam, everybody falls down. I'm not sure if you can find by the people. They have those cobblestone streets. I was right. Old fashioned. And unless you're really, and of course, in Amsterdam, it's hard to watch where you're going because there's a lot of distractions. So bike's flying all over the place. The bikes and those people under windows of all varieties and shapes and whatever. That don't grow. A lot of distractions. So I fell right on my, but at least I broke my phone with my hands. I'm assuming he would probably have a briefcase in his hand or something so he couldn't break the fall. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I've died. But here, right. We haven't heard another word about that. It's a deep dark secret. I've been living as a teenager up there. I'll tell you, I just wanted to say hello to my buddy Quieson who I've been spoken to a long time ago to the great job when you were away. And the other thing there is regarding the hockey playoffs watching that game last night. I mean, three over time. The hitting was vicious. Yeah, right from the beginning. All right from the time Tucker said on your main. Exactly. I was just about to say that. And did you see him? He was on the ground. Yeah. Rowan acquiesced. I was rolling around. Totally. I don't care what. And I know, see, the thing of bothers me up here for all the gung-ho hockey fans. I believe in the city is crazy. Yeah. But, you know, Bel for an even dawn cherry last night. Well, I, you know, look at what a great athlete he is. And he's all prepared. And everybody love a bad one and like that. And then the second period starts after coaches, court and referee try to make excuses. And he lets another greasy one in front of an impossible angle. And I was too nothing. That was. I don't care if he made 170 to say you can't in a playoff slid in a couple of greasy goals like that. The Leafs should have won in regulation two nothing. They'd have a strangle hole on the series. But just keep in mind back to last night. He led him to and even the winning goal by wrecking. He got a piece of it. But I've been. It's in the net. Let's everybody go home. That was terrible. Look what happened to Kojo last night with Detroit. He led in that goal. Oh, right. Yeah. That kid. Krob through in from the corner. He was already on his knees when it went in the upper corner. That'll teach him. That's what they get for swapping goal. Right. So, you know, anyway, I'm just saying it's been a great series. That's far of various games around the league. And I'm sure we're hearing lots of a discussion about it on QA. I'm on our sports day. I don't go to QA. I'm from my hockey talk. But I'll tell you something. It's been a great time so far. And I'm looking forward to the next couple of months. My favorite time of the year. And how about those lightning, man? I know. What's up with that? There are course. I like them. I think they're going to win that series. Oh, by the way. Have you noticed how need of Meyer and a few of the expanters have been playing in their series for the Tevergrate. And Stu Barnes for now is have a great day. We don't want to go down that road again. Okay. Well, let's see him no more. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60. I remember those days of taxing, you know. Yeah. And Rick Rally would come on on the afternoon. Rick and suds. And people would call up Rick and say, who's this Chris Wells guy must be awful. Important because that's all Neil talks about. Yeah. And they were right. They were right. And of course, you kept pushing me do more more hockey talk. Can't book and remember to be a guest on show. You stopped more hockey talk. Yeah, because now we don't do it anymore. It's a highly unlikely you ever get that free lunch. Oh, yeah. It was right on the verge. WQAM. Neil. Yes sir. Good morning. How you doing? I'm doing good. How you? Neil, I'm doing good after last night. I'm a big choir fan. What a game, huh? Oh, so sorry. I mean, I'm so sorry you won. You know, it wasn't great game though. I had no question about it. You know, they could not be on the house to take you this. Not only in Belford, it didn't two terrible goals in a marginal third one. But if you're going to be in a Stanley Cup playoffs, you don't get ten shots in two periods. And what the, or no, I'm sorry, they got ten shots in regulation in the first three Purs. How do you go to win a game with ten shots? You're right for two of them went in. Exactly. There you go. Well, you know, what as a goalie, it's hard for him to stay sharp. You're getting ten shots in a game. He's cold. I mean, you know, then you come to come to me. I think he's a choker, Jack Manic. I think that if they be taking a lot more shots, they'd be kicking his ass. And you've seen it throughout the series. I mean, at overtime, he was just like Belford. They were great. But during a regulation, they just got to get more shots on. The series that we're making makes us save. It's weird. I mean, he's just over the place. Yeah. Well, I mean, he had a great year, great say percentage. And, and Kenny Johnson hit the post and like before, you know, the overtime the other night. So that's the other way. And these are great games. That's not Kenny Johnson. What's that kids name? That's not Kenny Johnson. That's he plays on. Kenny Johnson. Kenny. Yeah. Don't say Kenny. Yeah. We got too many. Yonsons. Too many. Okay. Good luck to you, sir. Next season, but not any more this year. You're going to be there. George for the game five. I got my tickets. Hacking it in Canada. 5 6 7 0 5 6. You were getting pretty hockey intensive now. I like a playoff's going on. You never know it by listening to QMS. Especially on a morning show because he thinks hockey sucks. He's a bosom man. They're talking football this morning on a mo show. They're talking about junior's say out. And they're talking football. Oh my god. Woo. The aroma was whampton right through this board here. I had to go out and get some Mr. Clean. Good. Got all my the football in the middle of April. Oh, no. Don't forget what's coming up this weekend. Is it on the schedule? Set. I'm sure it is.

I thought you were right. Now that you mentioned that part. Yeah. I was almost positive that we're talking about this Saturday. Mean the draft show. I don't see nothing on my schedule. Don't tell me Clarence could have made another mistake. Oh, God. Clarence. Next Saturday. Oh, next Saturday. Well, that should be on my schedule for next week. There it is. Saturday April 26. So we got a whole week we're pre. So we don't have to do it to all my football talk. Got it. I mean, the middle of April. What's the temperature there, Dave? About 30 Celsius. About. Yeah.

Hello Baghdad didn't follow was handed over this also information throughing house from the Pacific news service. I'm not gonna read it not too many bedtime stories Arabic media are speculating with a safka Arabic for a secret deal was arranged between the US and the Bath regime to hand over Baghdad Although nobody can pinpoint the exact terms. There are three clear outcomes first. The lives of many American British forces as well as most senior bath officials were spared Second, Baghdad itself didn't turn in the blood bath widely anticipated by military experts and third the war was shortened dramatically saving the region especially Saudi Arabia from catastrophic consequences See we're doing two out of three wasn't bad, but once we got to the fact that we saved Saudi Arabia from catastrophic consequences that was unfortunate in my humble opinion If it gets my drift Well, we got some good stuff on there today, you know, this this may be the all-time award winner. It just gets better every day Oh, and it is a good website that's murking shimt.com Not only has it got the t-shirts and a mugs and all of us stuff, but verse them good articles on there including the one by area and a hopping did I forget to say that to you Which one? I don't have anything for Mariana hopping to where you calm down The one where the headline is a victory aside the invasion was a bad idea I didn't see it this morning. I'll send it tomorrow. I was it was in my pile, but as you saw it were so damn many of my just I forgot about it Starts out by saying the Bible tells us that pride goeth before the fall in Iraq it came throughout after it From the moment that statue of Sodom who's saying hit the ground the mood around the rum spill campfire has been all high fives I told you so as an endless preddling about the speedy fall of Baghdad is proof that those will pose the invasion of Iraq were dead wrong What other nonsense she says in fact a speedy fall of Baghdad proves the anti-war movement was dead right the whole pretext for our unilateral charge into Iraq was that the American people were an imminent danger from Hussein and his mighty war machine What it turns out that far from being on the verge of destroying Western civilization who's saying in this 21st century Nazis couldn't even muster a half-hearted defense in their own capital Well, that a good start up. I'll save that. I don't know how it's good. I'll save that And also to one by Tim Robbins.

Because eating lots of pizza tomorrow. He's sitting there shoveling food and you're put started by dieting You're like the freaking beast you're like a smaller slumber very good at being much dieting.

Oh, that's him He's talking about diet doctors anyway could pick it up. I'm a good friend Dr. Bob, but I was trying to say is Dr. Robert Hacens is best selling low-carb high protein diet was dismissed as nutritional Folly for years, but was recently validated in some research died today as folksman city was 72 See it it's just struck me. How do you like that out of nowhere man? This is And you know who I'm starting to get visions about out loud. You want to know though? Don't say no. I was just had a vision about Do do do do do do he Atkins died at New York wild Cornell medical center and was surrounded by his wife and close friends said Richard Rothstein spokesman said Atkins suffered as if you're head into your own you who's gonna be really distraught Who's already psychotic I give up here's a hint Las Vegas Viva. Oh, yeah I'm looking to do for living now I'm looking to have been looking at atkins diet things but it was cruises for a long time and of course Dr. Bob not that the Face man isn't around all of them sure that the People are probably atkins program will keep it going but it'll never be the same without the face man Right the name will go on Atkins suffered as if your head injury a parade after falling on an icy sidewalk while walking to work last April He was hospital hospitalized for cardiac arrest Which he said was related to an infection of the heart now related to the diet Atkins first advocated his unorthodox weight loss plan which emphasizes meat eggs and cheese and Discourages bread rice and fruit in his 1970 to book Dr. Rackens died revolution Its publication came at a time when the medical establishment was encouraging a low fat high carb diet Which is why so many people died prematurely by the way the following year the AMA dismissed atkins diet is nutritional Folly and Congress summoned him to Capitol Hill to defend the plan Leverling it potentially dangerous the AMA said the diets unscientific underpinning was naive and biochemically incorrect It's scolded the books publishers for promoting bizarre concept of nutrition and dieting right despite this His books sold 15 million copies and millions of people tried the diet atkins philosophy Injured a resurgence in the mid 1990s with Dr. Rackens new diet revolution Which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide and spent five years on the year times best seller list But criticism of the diet lingered with many arguing and could affect kidney function Raise cholesterol levels and the private diet of important nutrients Atkins said no study showed that people with normal kidney function develop problems because of a high protein diet And never gave into his detractors the fending his plan at the American dieted Because association is convention in 2000 atkins quipped. I'm very happy to be here not as happy as Daniel in the Lions then This year his approach was vindicated and part by the very medical community that's scorned him In February some half doesn't study show that people on the atkins dad lost weight without compromising their health The study showed that atkins dieters cardiovascular risk factors no raw cholesterol profiles change for the better Let me read that again the study showed that atkins dad is cardiovascular risk factors and overall cholesterol profile change for the better fact that at that Still many of the researchers were reluctant to recommend the atkins diet saying a large new study now The way could settle lingering questions of its long term effects and this thing goes on and on and on about the diet to this and you can eat that et cetera It does say to Atkins the key dietary relevant and obesity was carbohydrates He argued that makes susceptible people pump out too much insulin which internal encourages and to put on fat and least if nothing else On that he is So rest in peace doctor Bob okay and speaking of that or just what I'm gonna have for lunch now good doctorackens are no carb lunch bacon cheeseburger now We I don't want to do I can cook that up right here.
