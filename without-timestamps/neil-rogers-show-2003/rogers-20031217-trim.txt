Yeah, but he won't let me talk in his show But he's smart to the I am in addition to which he didn't have to let you talk because he's got just Non-stop those sports callers.

The inspired of course by the strum thermistor and that's what I voted for I think that's and that's so when and so far. That's the greatest is shocking. You know what's nobody's talking about it? Which of these was the greatest act of hypocrisy? Rush Lemba illegal pill popper? Copp who's had George W. Bush lectures about morality? Races tromburment had fathered illegitimate blank daughter 16 year old girl. He knocked her up. She had a daughter and then finally we'd find out let's see with 1941 15.62 years later we find out about it. Rush, it's got to be more than that wasn't she like 70 something? Whatever. Feline to re-represented of Henry Hard lectures Clinton on morality. I wonder how that guy out in Western is doing a piece to lie the guy whose wife and we hide stole and told that he wasn't married. Jim Baker rips off his father which turned out to be a pervert. He was selling condos in that way. What the other day called at the kingdom of something rather? No idea. King the Mugyushki. Yeah there were solid condos in other words they had like 100 condos but they were still like 200. They didn't have them. And then of course come to find out he was as cruel as brains out not only with women but with well. Jimmy Swagger it sends with hookers. My lord I have sinned remember that and then they still keep getting a son of their money. That's the thing that I love. And look what has no vote so far born again John Van B's book the Beezer calls one of his players nigger. Actually it was the goal on a minor league team he was coaching here in Canada. I don't know where to vote on this one. It was a tough choice. I voted for Strom Thurman. Because here is one of the well see you're not old no to remember just how virulent he was. He was in 1948. One of the lead segregationist in America with his dixie crat party and a whole deal and turned against the Democrats and to just a virulent racist son of a bitch. So I guess basically as philosophy was those darkies are okay in a bedroom but other nats is to keep me in their place. Okay. In fact maybe he screwed her in the back of the bedroom as opposed to luck in the front of the bedroom maybe on a packet of bed. Or maybe somebody was on their back. And that said that he let's the pull question so far. So far Strom Thurman illegitimate black daughter 12. Coke booze home George W. Bush lecturing about morality he's the guy that was bring her bring morality back to the White House after bubble with him bluestrain and squirts quarreled stains on the white dresser was at the other way around. Rush Limbaugh illegal pill popper 7 Jim Baker Ripsop his followers turns out to be a pervert five. Jimmy Swaggered sends with hookers three. Philandering Henry Hardlector's foot on morality 2 and born again John the Beezer calls his goalie a nigger no no votes yet. Nobody said I guess born again Christians can use the n word right. I've always been so good. Huh? I voted for us. 13 died 22 wounded his truck bomb explosion bagged. A truckloader with explosives that was apparently on its way to strike a police station blow up in the middle of a busy intersection in Baghdad today when a collider with a bus killing 13 people in wounding 22 the Iraqi police said. The explosion took place about a half a mile from the Amel police station in the Bayi area of the south west of South West Baghdad. Among that it were three children two girls in a boy who were ripped apart from the blast. It was horrible said second lieutenant Ahmed Suhaal. I've never seen a bomb this big. I want to remind you that every one of these people including these children who are being who dying and being decapitated in whose lives are being destroyed. Every one of these people is a victim of the illegal attack on Iraq. Just keep that in mind. While you're all swelbed up with glory and excitement about these pictures of Sodom that horrible terrorists used to be our close personal buddy. I know that's hard for a lot of people to swallow but that's the fact. I just like that letter that I read to the editor from the star. These are war crimes. Just as grotesque. Just as gruesome. Just as unacceptable. Based on a pack of lies. Here's some of those the beast is all excited about. Now I put it before the show you're pretty whipped up about it so why don't you just get sick. And then you can get some medical marriage a witty. Oh yeah. And appeals court rule yesterday that if federal law outlawing marijuana does not apply to sick people or allowed a smoke pot with an office recommendation, you're sick. Everybody in a building we go along with that. You're about as sick as they come. Yeah, yeah. So what's not to like? In fact, maybe we can get you back on balance for life. And inside your black sack, there'll be like a little something extra in the sack. Side me out. They're ruling by the night. A circuit court of appeals was a blow to the federal government. It's fight against medical marijuana. The justice departments argue that state medical marijuana laws were dumped by federal drug laws. The case also underscores the conflict between federal law in California is 1996 medical marijuana law, which allows people to grow smoke or obtain marijuana for medical needs with a doctor's recommendation. Eight of the states have similar laws. The justice department wasn't immediately available to come. It occurs to busy looking their wounds. There was a role in a big fat one. In its two to one decision, the courts had prosecuting medical marijuana. A user's under the federal laws. Unconstitutional. If the marijuana is not sold, transported across state lines are used for non-medicidal purposes. Judge Harry Priegerson wrote for the majority that smoking pot on the advice of a doctor is a different different kind from drug trafficking. The court added that this limited use is clearly distinct from the broader illicit drug market. Yesterday's ruling sent the case back to the district judge. And while the women's case is yet to be tried, the women who have brought the suit. The appeals court said that two of them straightened a strong likelihood of success on a mirror. It's how do you like that? Oh, right. That's one tiny step for mankind and one bad step backwards for the fascist in there in the DEA. The pop police. WCWM. Yeah. As far as that poll goes, how about Marion Barry for snoring the sport and cocaine and Jesse Jackson for father and shows him out of wedlock and then you'll leave the public eye and it's saying, oh, my people on me back. Or is there no racist? Yeah, it must sound like a racial thing to me. It's a racial thing. I mean, those two guys, and I think the reason I think there is there much, much more in the forefoot than strong term and especially in the last few years. Not in that Marion Barry. Jesse Jackson, I agree with you, but Marion Barry was the mayor of Washington DC. Most people, though, even though, who down Marion Barry was the thing he played for Redskins. Yeah, I was never done with him. I was never done with him. Anyway, you know what he was like. Exactly. Oh, but Jesse Jackson. I have a great holiday, pound, sick of the body. Let's get that on. Now you're going to email these Derek or not. He's probably listening because he does a lot of work. Yes, but after you're tragic, failure to communicate with him yesterday is pretty pissed off. Not. No, she actually, I, what I'm doing now this week is fact seeing the poll that I've before. Right. Because I realize it's kind of like a packed work situation out of your fillet in there for George because your main concern is the Joe Rojo. They have to do sports updates on him. I mean, consider the radio station is sports. So we're very grateful for the fact that they've loaned us the beast this week. Just to be with us and sit in there and like hold our hand. Sports. It's where it's out on this station. So let's add that on our Jesse Jackson father's illegitimate child. We, we, we ought to put the Reverend Jesse Jackson, shouldn't we? If you just make a kosher who has nothing to do with the Mary and Barry, I think he played tight in once. And, and the best part of the thing with Barry didn't they we elect him? Then he'd get like elected back in again after the first drug boss. I think so. I think he did. People like your crook like in the sunrise like John Lamello. He can man Raule Martinez and Haley.

Doug OOS OSE. Who was introducing a Bill in Congress. He wants to increase the FCC's infamous 70 awards to eight. By doubling up on versions of asshole. So in other words, if he got his way, we couldn't say asshole on here anymore. No more. No grammatical novice. O's wants to ban nouns form noun forms as well as verb adjective gerend participle infinite forms of the words too terrible to speak. He's pissed off when I was this from reason online. Pist excuse me, peeve that you two frog man bono got away with saying, Everything during the Golden Globes were broadcast a while back. Noted first amendment attorney Robert Cornrevere's quoted in the story saying, There's no conceivable way that an approach like that could survive constitutional review. This is one of the reasons why radio and TVs have on aweswitches. Oh, man. What a concept. O's is Bill, HR 3687 is filled with dirty language he wants to ban from the airwaves. You can search for it here. Which we're not going to read it on the airfrovious reasons because we don't want them up to have another heart problem. But at any rate, the Bill says to amend section 1464 of Thedley, 1896 code to provide for the punishment of certain profane broadcast and for other purposes by inserting this and inserting it and cert this, okay you jackass. And then as used in a section that term profane used to be spectral language includes the words Schmitt. And that's that's the only way. I can't read the other one.

Why would he? I don't know. It sounds almost impossible, but it's true. He was signing autographs and I was signing autographs. And I don't remember what that was all about. But he, you know, he was nice enough to me. He was, you know, kind of gentile. He did not say it. But anyway, he said it to somebody we know. Are you sure? The mad dog is a matter of fact. Plus he gave that finger the one time to the crowd. Right. Oh, he's an asshole. Yeah. Wasn't that in Buffalo that he ever was in the bird? Yeah. Hey, Brian. How are you doing? Hey, Brian.

They want me to obviously have a target. So they told him probably be a good idea to take off the bow tie. They don't wear no bow ties in Baghdad. You know, he was like, oh, it looks pretty safe here to me. No, you know, he didn't say that. Yes, he did. The hell he did. He was looking over his shoulder.

No, no North Charlton South Carolina The Reverend Jesse Jackson led hundreds of marches carrying signs and chanting slogans yesterday to protest a drug sweep In which police with guns drawn ordered students to the floor We talked about that story extensively on a show and by now you must have seen those pictures many many times Critics say the way to peer to a targeted black students which police have denied Seeing it's a racial thing even on the right saw a lot of white kids didn't you see them pictures? Feast I never actually saw them though you never saw the stood and first they had those greeny pictures You know from the surveillance cameras then seeing in somehow got a lot better quality pictures that even had the audio What do we want justice when do we want it now Canada marches just say no to the police state red one sign Excellent police state we're not talking only about in South Carolina We're talking about the USA. We got a freaking police state. We got the word police or John Ascrop got fine for We'll get to that For his last campaign for the Senate which he lost with dead man John Ascrop's are getting his ass deeper and deeper into trouble Speaking of assholes We're gonna march again and again and again Jackson told those are rally in front of city hall They'll get bigger and bigger until there is fairness in the land said Jesse Now which daughter do we like the most? Jesse's daughter or that one from a strum terminate The November fifth rate on my birthday no less they got some stink in her bit strat for high and nearby goose creek Do national attention after video from surveillance camera showed students ordered to the floor While officers with guns and a drug dog searched them About a hundred students were searched no illegal drugs were found and nobody was arrested Besides denying any racial profiling police have said they believe the aggressive tactics were needed to ensure the safety of the officers and other students I mean somebody might have pulled out a joint and shot somebody with it right Two civil suits related to the rate have been filed in federal court state and federal officials are investigating Who are there any chronologicals were broken by the police the cops burst into the school or the main hallway very aggressively And started pointing their guns at everyone as if we were criminals stratford freshman Carl Alexander told a crowd senior Telly were a Tory Richards and fought back tears as she spoke She said it hurts my sister still has to go through that school. I don't want to go through the same thing that happened Or I want anybody else's kids to go through the same things she said As Jesse Jackson is there leaning hundreds in a protest at stratford high in South Carolina as fascism in America continues once more Man, so it's a frightening thing to see that as their goose step at all around the brown shirts would air helmet a bunch of helmeted freaks 567560 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line don't forget mark Eisenberg is out there someplace I think we ought to start sending Scott Junior.

It is never necessary to insert prejudice and discrimination of the Constitution A document that is a proud history of being used to expand an individual liberty and freedom not take them away said Winnie Stackleberg political director of the human rights campaign So you'll be pleased that I'll breathe easy the president says whatever it takes to keep them feet on him fags Man, he's gonna do it stop him down.

Newsweek reports is article by Christ in Carroll, the little piece of it. Before the invading Iraq was one of the world's most tightly controlled societies. Only a few specialized stories could sell boos and in recent years, drinking was banned outright of ther's al alimasing in hotels. Except, maybe, or I don't know, there's alim lysine there. Many in the ministry of culture kept the strict watch against even mildly naughty movies, magazines, and films, convicted prostitutes could be beheaded. Hard-cored drug abuse was virtually unknown if he didn't count certain members of Sodom's immediate family in their close friends. Now Iraqis like Ali, and it's got this Ali character to have the stories about, are making up for what they've missed and many other Iraqis young and old are blaming America. Some people say the spread of such things is designed to weaken our society, says Colonel Iwood Selman, a police chief and one of Baghdad's roughest districts, every day we hear from people on the street not just to religious people, but ordinary people too. Iraqis call it the bad side of freedom. The problems go far beyond Baghdad's tailgate liquor bizarres where wild-catch shopkeepers pedal booze from the back of cars, or the arrays of skin magazines unfold display at the teaming, Bobby Sharjee Market in the heart of town. The worries isn't the only growing up, is known as growing number of visibly intoxicated people around the market, or the pharmacope of pills that are really available there without prescription. Maybe Rush can go to Baghdad. Stuck up on Samoxi. What bothers many Iraqis apparently even some of those who make their living from the sin industry is the question of where Iraq is headed. Walked down the street from the market to the adult cinemas where 70 cents buys an all day ticket, and the audience hoots in protest of a non-ported graphic trailer in reps the action. We have to compete with the satellites as the manager of one theater almost apologetically, a third of the country's population is estimated to have access to pornographic TV channels by satellite dish for those who don't enter pricing dealers, becord the footage on video discs and sell them for a pitence. Under Saddam this would have been automatic six months in jail, says of ender who keeps ultra-exuars and a drawer for special customers, and his video shop and Baghdad's Karatah district, now nothing will happen to us. And it goes on a great life. So in other words, you get more freedoms in Iraq than we got in the US, like that the poor lady in Texas that we had the story on yesterday about her a deal though arrest, her sex toy arrest in Texas, no, you've heard of Tex-Mex, there's no Tex-X, that's the problem, banned in Texas. Speaking of that, D.A.D. filed charges against Jackson, it's about time is that they sure are drag and this thing out a lot. Give us something to look forward to. Saddam Barber County prosecutor said they'll file charges in a molestation case against Michael Jackson Thursday or Friday, and they've hired a public relations firm to handle the expected crusher of news media inquiries. The charges will be filed at the court house in Santa Maria near the singer's never-land ranch, district attorney Thomas Stedden said in the statement, Stedden is hiring a firm to deal with the media-drew-mediod criticism from Jackson family spokesman Brian Otsman, he said it was improper because the district attorney is supposed to try the case in court, now in the press. Otsman also repeated criticism of Stedden from making jokes at a news conference last month when Jackson's arrest warrant was announced. It's an affront to common sense if not professional ethics, for a D.A.D. to have a celebrity crisis management team, which is what this new PR firm styles itself as being Otsman said. He added first we had a press conference where the D.A. told jokes, and now we have a PR firm, or the D.A. has hired that also represents the cartoon at work. A secretary at the D.A.'s office said Stedden would have no further comment. So tomorrow or Friday, I'm pretty sure it's going to be tomorrow. Are you, can you smell the coming? Are you here? I'm here. Are you awake? Are you getting out of quiet? Off the car, like you're taking a snooze, or maybe like you're eating. Nope, I just sent another shake though. Yeah, bull crap. It's not like you got the shake saw. I said I not have another shake. Yeah. In between the potato pancakes and brisket that the court he said, oh, that'd be good for Friday if we could arrange that. Corquise to arrange some juice food. Well, how are we going to arrange that? I can't do it. I can't do it by long long this. I'm still looking for the word. I don't know. I've been begging for it for two days. They don't see them. They know I'm not there. So they're not going to bring you away. They don't give a crap about you. And for a goi like Josh, I got to bring him. But they don't like his. You don't even know what that hell that is. He doesn't. No, he's not going to clue what it is. He probably like it though. In fact, the Duff said this morning, he's got something for Josh. That he doesn't know what it is, but he'd probably like it. And Josh ran out in the hallway. Looking for help. 354 votes on the poll. And of course, it's a good thing Clarence said that this week because he would run into him. He did come back inside. Talk about being cornered. Which of these was the greatest active hypocrisy. That's our poll on theorangers.com today. Rush Limbaugh, illegal pill popper, he'll be on an eight minutes by the way for the right wing. I did a heads out there. Don't miss Rush, baby. La ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta. Yeah, phony baloney. 104 c's the biggest hypocriter of all. I'm going first that I put that that lady on there that what's your name? LC May Schwartz. That her name is. Come on. God, that was pathetic. She looks just like Thurman. Looks just like Tram though. Just like him. Obscurious. She looked exactly like him. Racist Tram the Thurman had fathered illicitment black daughter 84. Hope booze home George W. Bush lectures about morality 67. Reverend Jesse Jackson follows illegitimate child 33. I think it's a racial thing myself. Jim Baker Ripsop is followers turned out to be a pervert 32. Jimmy Swaggered, since with hookers 17, Philan who represented the Henry Hyde, lectures Clinton on morality 15, and born again John the Beezer van Beezbrook calls one of his players the gold tender actually was a nigger 2 out of 354. Rumor voted twice. He's not fooling me. 560, 560, pound 560 on a AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line. Don't forget little schedule change, market down for those who keep score at QM every day.

He's kept dog. He looks pretty good. Good man. He's in you can ask him in person before it goes on here. Hey boo what's the likes of working with a dead man? That's a family. Why do you say that? They've been born a such a nice guy. He's horrible. He's brutal. I don't care if he's a nice guy. There's a lot of nice people. If you're out on the street corner right now meet nice people. That doesn't mean we ought to put him on the air. To broadcast ball games. Joseph Gekke's a nice guy. He's horrible. Great. He's embarrassing. I like to allow him. But his perfor. See you can't separate. That's the problem with you. You can't separate the wheat from the chaf. When your spad is you are your chafelot. You probably have to put like a lot of cashmere bouquet in a lot of gold bond powder. In your crock area from all the chafing, especially in a summertime. The crow said he'd loan you some of his. Some of that cashmere bouquet that he bathes in. No but you can't separate the difference between somebody you like and somebody who's got talent. Do you see what I'm saying? Now you have to, well you won't have to because you won't do it. You must admit if you're going to be the least bit honest. The Joseph Gekke is not a good play by playing out. I'm saying that so I'm being so diplomatic. No, that can that thing. I want to respond to him on Furby. You jump out words. Okay, see you won't do it because he doesn't want to shoot him. So does a great job. I think Joe does a great job. Of what? Do it in the games. Get outta here. Now you, as he got his legs and fingers and eyes crossed, Josh, you've got to be kidding me. Oh my, oh my! You are so full of crap, man. See actually the beast isn't fat at all. He weighs 150 to rest of it's all crap. If you could ever get all the crap out of your body, you'd weigh like I said, 150 pounds. Soking wet. All right, setting him aside. A davant boring. Now you've got to admit the guy is just coma inducing. He doesn't inject even the slut. How do you compare davant boring for example with boo? When boo is doing his uh, innings of the game, whatever it really does. How do you make that comparison? I think boo's a lot more enthusiastic. Yeah, which is a backhanded way of saying that davant's boring is hell. He is coma inducing. Why can't you just say it? You know it's true. You told me that before we went on the air this morning, you said he's the most boring man on a radio in history. Did you say that? No. Well, I just made it up. I'm trying to butcher you up a little bit. I'm trying to put you beyond beyond the state. There's just being another asslicker, okay? There's millions of asslickers out there in the uh, naked city. Why do you want to be another one? There's too many asslickers in this business. Why can't you just tell the black it is? Why can't you say he's a nice guy, but his work sucks. Just like I say. I don't show it. I don't think it's work sucks. I think he's professionally does a decent job. He's just not Mr. excitement. Oh, god, you're you're hopeless. You're really hopeless. 560 to 20560. The beast is a wimp. The beast is a suck hole. The beast has got his head way up in there. In fact, maybe the beast has got his eyes on daves' wife. And more, this is for trail by city. Way too AM. At a homeland security dam ridge, advising you to put duct tape on your radio when I raise the morning color to think for the Neil Rogers 12 to 1 hour. 10 What the highest summa gave me when they made it to me all the time, but go ask,"Willow, You're a shook-y fuel well-supply. If you need a ball, founding them footballs, you'll be able to bring me to a higher-assimal play. I can have a groom, rather than not get posted. Change to my friends in a higher-mold play. Go ask Willow. Should get you some horse and a handful of baseballs. You can see it. I invite my sub-legance and ready to build bulls up and sub-perce you. In other December's, friends, let's extract the gold out of their teeth and rotate the proceeds to the R&C. As we show a vice-a-force for our glorious leader, as well as Ruma. You'll get you through your show, and you'll be able to build a bull-mold by putting a logic out of proportion to justify your seemingly-made out-mars. I'm talking backwards, my little friend. Oh, damn, how's it going? Let's get you guys, please go. Yeah, remember what we're swimming balls in. All drug abuseers should be dead. This is for quite a lot of stuff. Come on, 3-5-60, W-2-M-Happy holidays to you. Booster for a mad dog at 2-The-Humper, the load at 4. Now, who's going to be a chulose? I believe it. Who's going to chulose Hank, the Humper in the studio? I don't wonder when we're going to hang 4-5. Then you got your pants in preview at 7-9. Big game, anybody going to be there? No. He watched in crampittals, man. He really sucked at the a panther. He's oughta be a good match. 7-3-9, maybe got a shot to win. After the hockey game, it's ADK and Jol and Mark overnight, 2-5. And Mark Eisenberg right now, to win his toy drive, to want to clock at the Sears Park and Lot, town center mall in Boca. He's got the best meal stuff with him. Any report yet? No. Yeah, he's got one toy. For us? No, for the drive, obviously. Or for him. He just pocketed 120 bucks. Well, that's not too bad. 120 bucks. I haven't spent nothing. No, no, he got one toy. Oh, one toy. That you said 120. He's got one toy? One toy. No. Man, I'll say that, Jol and Mark. Even even our group all scot. Jol and Mark, between the two of you guys, the problem is that their people are all sleeping right now. See their audiences up to the five in the morning, to the night owls, to the degenerates, to the other one. So, when they're drugged, you'll speak the second around in the dark night. Wait and sitting on the edge of their bed, waiting for most voice to come on, put them to sleep. So, that's not the right time of day. They'd be ought to be doing their things overnight, like late at night in a parking lot. Sell some stereo speakers, things like that, and pick up some toys. So, they got one toy. I thought you said 120. One toy. Oh, that's bad. Anyway, I've done as much as I can for him. But Dean leads Democratic pack in Pennsylvania holding Bush under 50 percent. See, this two-leagrement man, this guy is really frosted my as big-time. I mean, pissing me off. Going on the all-out attack. I mean, he occasionally mentions you know, Bush didn't have a plan. Yaddi, yaddi, yaddi, yaddi, yaddi, yaddi. But he's just, he tried to decimate Howard Dean, because he's the, he's the a-pimp now. Joligrement. The reason him is the attack dog. Great. But the good news is Howard Dean is pulling ahead of the Democratic PAC among Pennsylvania voters and is the only candidate to get this from the prestigious Boston Globe. The only candidate to keep President Bush under the crucial 50% mark occurred to a poll released only moments ago. The Quinnipiac University poll shows Dean the former Vermont Governor holding a double digit lead over his closest Democratic rival in Pennsylvania, the nation's fifth largest electoral prize, Dean gets 28%. He appeared to 17% for Jewelie Burman and 10% for Dick Gibhardt, only 10% Pennsylvania like Dick. Former General West now, he, you know, Clark isn't doing much, you know, are you kind of surprised? Yeah. I thought he'd be doing like right up there. I'd really know no why because he had a lot of Delhi, and South Florida hates some really good post-traumys sandwiches. One of them turned out to be encoder. Former General West, the Clark elected 9% Senator John Kerry's 7% he looks really scary good old John Kerry. Too much to go, Dean held a mere 5% of the support. How many of them? Too much to go, Dean at 5% now he's got 28. Look, a runaway freight train, a popular freight train is just running through America, baby. How about how hard to handle the bandwagon? No. You don't? I'm a carry guy. And that's that Massachusetts thing. He is that. Oh, just because he looks like his faces already been extra mile rush more. Would a craiggy pussy his? He's nothing man. No, that's because I met him before. Oh, well, that, that, my, I'm going to vote for Greg Reed. I met him. In the race of the Democratic presidential nomination, Howard Dean, I'm going to vote for Mike Rosen-Tall. I met him. And that's got to be the most stupid thing I've ever heard, Beast. And I see, you're, at least you're consistent. You're consistently full of crap. Like suck it up to Joseph Gackie. I'm not talking about personally about talent. Suck it up to David and boring and being, I mean, you just, you know, you talk of good game. But when push comes the show, you know, when you really are giving the opportunity to open up that fat mouth of yours and tell it like you really feel you can't do it. You're, you're just too much of a whim. You pretend to be like Mr. Out of Rages and Mr. All he's talking about Joe's contract and channel. So, you know, all the inside stuff about and you never did tell us the inside stuff about Moe, this audience would lick your ass. What do you mean? There's no anything. You get some of those stories that you always used to come in and like zip your lip at all. If you only knew of you only knew how about stuff. How about after you fired me from a show when he called me cell phone and, and it can, he, excuse me of telling all of his audience that, uh, he was a bad man and they should call up his show and, uh, T. He called you on his cell phone and told you, yeah, he called me on his way home from the show one day accusing me of like a spreading bad PR about him that his audience turned on him because of me. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. You should answer the phone. Howard from Broke. That's incredible. So now you're redeeming yourself. That's one really good tid, but that's excellent. Keep thinking of some more of them. We'll have 80 share by the end of the day if you just start revealing me. He called you on your cell phone and bitched you out in a queues view of turning the audience against him. At least you got him off my ass anyway. Briefly. Anyway, Dean 28 in Pennsylvania, Lieberman 17, give our 10, Wesley Clark O'Neighen percent, Carrie 7. In the race with Democratic presidential nomination the Howard Dean Badwick in the beginning to roll in Pennsylvania said play after Richard's assistant director of the Hampton Connecticut based Quinn P.A. University polling Institute. Lie Insta Tuta. Senator Lieberman and Representative Gibbard are holding on but gender Clark and Senator Carrie are back in single digits, he said. Even more telling. Dean would hold Bush to a 49 to 43 percent margin while a president would score 50 percent against Lieberman Carrie and Clark and 51 percent against Gibbard in Pennsylvania to the polls shows. But a slim majority of Pennsylvania voters are upset with the president for rolling back steep tariffs on steel and ports earlier this month. More than a year before it was sent to expire, the tariffs indeed the Republican president to political allies in what is it politically key rust bill states including Pennsylvania but now he's of tourists. So there you go. Dean is doing well in Pennsylvania. He's way ahead 23 point A. New Hampshire. He's going to do damn good in Iowa, maybe even win it. The Lieberman says he wants to do good in South Carolina, Arizona and some other gracious thing. I mean who the hell is he kidding? How many Jews out there in those three three states put together? About third man. They're going to vote for Jewelie Breman, who the hell is he joking? I got a great story, a great article about George Soros, one of my favorite people in the world who is now even more, one of my favorite people. First of all, he's got a lot of money, maybe he'll owe me some. This is a great article from cybercastnewservicecnsnew.com. George Soros, atheism fuels conservative rage. I love it. I'm going to read this. It's long. Do I have your permission to do it? Go ahead. I'm not going to do it right now. Okay. Because I'd have to interrupt myself. Well here's one you can relate to. Fifty cent. Fifty cent. One of your kind of people. I guess your rose don't like that kind of music though. He doesn't like the thug music. Yeah, I don't either. I hate it. I don't like the thug music. I don't like the whole concept. I'll ambience the whole gangster. The whole gangster thing. You know. That's right. I forgot it's a racial thing. I thought it was against the thing. I thought it'd be bad. George, I'm way out of it. Trapper Fifty cent recently accepted a video music award with his mentor Eminem. He isn't acting when he wraps about murder and mayhem and videos like many men. In real life, Fifty was shot nine times. Did you know that? How many times? How many times? Yeah, thanks Robert. He survived to make monster hits like Inda Club. Now he's getting hit with a barrage of lawsuits over his posseys allegedly violent behavior. I'm watching your posseys. That's what I told Scouran. I do every day. Music video actor Jamar Isam is about to lawsuit against Fifty cent real name Curtis Jackson. Charging the rapper's bodyguard struck him in a face with their fists. While it was at Rally Studios in Manhattan Beach to make a Fifty cent video, Jamar said he had photos taken of his injury shortly after the beating and in this police reporter witness confirmed the attacks. By the way, speaking of photos at a beating, whatever happened to those Michael Jackson photos that were supposed to be germane to the case. Remember that he was abused by the police? How could we didn't see those? Don't know. Anyway, this guy says he was the guy just rushes me and tackles me in all five six guys. Just come on top of me. Oh boy, the beast is getting excited about hearing that. Scouran, Scouran. Just stop and make kicking me my head just touching me. I couldn't do anything. I since it happened after we told to go to Wardrobe to thug up for part of part in the video. Thug up. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. It says it was waiting for his costume with several other extras when Fifty cent body guards told him to stand back and flying Fifty cent was in Wardrobe and they were too close. Iceman says they politely comply but says guards chose to attack him moments later anyway. Iceman's lawsuit is the latest in a stringer complaint say limo drivers also suing Fifty cent charging the rappers body guards attacked him after he picked them up in his limo Alabama with it without a banjo on his knee. And even the surgeon who treated Fifty cents bull are wound spheres who go with suit charging on paid medical bills. Now this suit demands Fifty cent also paid medical bills to mars as he racked up after his beating. Dermars says I've worked with a lot of people I've never had a problem. He says the beating left him with lingering pain smashes career he finds himself being shut out of the music video business. He says they blackballed me from the business and I'm just the innocent guy here. They blackballed and it sounds like a play on words to me. Court allow this is the story that they've the cop was foaming at the mouth of out in the past me yesterday. And just have a good point, this roach you have a fact this is to get it becoming. At least the pin court issued a traffic warning on Monday be aware of what whom you ride if drugs are found in a vehicle all occupants can be arrested. The justice is said in a unanimous nine zip decision. It was a victory for Maryland and twenty other states who argued police frequently find drugs and traffic stops but no one in the vehicle claims them. The court all gave officers to go ahead to arrest everybody like if they stopped the beast out of the way home and they found a pinjo in his anstreth. He could say oh that's moe as he left it in there right? Always blame it on moe. Absolutely. In a small space like a car and officer could reasonably infer a common enterprise among a driver and passengers they just as his rule. The case then proven incident in 1999 when police involved a more separate full of restfeeding car. A search reveal the rule of cash in a glove compartment and cocaine in the armrest in the back seat. The driver and two passengers did not have anything to do with a contraband. So all three men were arrested. So don't be driving with anybody who's like a druggy don't be driving with them. I just mentioned that for when George comes back. 1213 at five sixty wqm if your hair is gone like the beast you got to choice you can look like the beast or you can look like moe with a silly a musk right on your head or you can look like a munch.

From 2560-WQ, I'm going to get a big big one to two hour coming up. I bet there's going to be a really good day too. It's always great. What are you going to be doing based, even if you're going to be eating? Now I'll just sit here, you know what TV? Sit there and soak it in, watch some TV, watch some Pornow on TV. 435 votes, which of these was the greatest act of hypocrisy. Speaking of Pornow on TV, I want to have the Playboy channels doing anything Pornographic right now. Keep your hand here, the Nupon. The shop in private. Oh, with dot com. You plug this? I don't want to tell you where they're going to plug it. There are three of mine assofen. He's going to instrument, let me just put it to this way, you can't buy it in Texas, okay? It gives us five, four. Two, one. But not working. And it tells you to pump. Oh, you can't. It's pumping. It increases, it's like, you know, girth or whatever. Yeah. Yes, you've got an electric bill there and you squeeze it, you pump it up. Like, I don't know what to say. She's pumping it up. And like your cake goes sort of thing. Yeah. So it's timing thing and then he goes five, four, three, two, one. And that's when you squeeze your muscle. Okay. Anyway, well, I see I have, it's always dangerous for me to put that audio on here because if we, we got to get that dump button now. I'm right on it. Here's a facts that says this is from Jim who's very very tidy with his words. You didn't like to overdo it. Leave of Dave Horn. Do you see that? Leave a big one. Yeah. He is a great subscriber. What is going on? Don't like his terrible commentators. Well, okay, Bill, we'll leave of Dave Horn. He sucks. Now, here's another one and this one starts out like somebody has an idea what they're talking about. See, this is why sports in South Florida such a joke. The idea that we have a sports station because like I've told you before, most people in South Florida don't even understand what sports are all about. They don't even know what their rules are. This is a pathetic fact. What's I say? It's on a cake. It says, I don't know how any baseball fan could listen to this. Dave and what the hell? As you know, batting averages are state of her example as 0.357 is state of this 357. This layman's will consistently say 357. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. 357. I've never heard him say that. Well, wait, this will show you what a genius this guy is. Who facts this? It makes me pissed off and fired up when he does that. Wow, or I'm a short stop to second to first double play. We all know that is a six five four double play. I'm not way. Jesus Christ, he will say a six to five to four double play. Somebody shoot me, okay? I need to write the news to you sir. But a baseball scoring five is the third baseman. Could that would be one hell of a double play a short to third to second? I ain't never seen that one before. That's tough. So a six four three double play, according to this guy is a six five four. Sir, you would know a baseball of somebody stuck up, but it doesn't them and the four Haitian guys that were sewing them all up your ass at the same time. You idiot, you. That's pathetic. That is so soft Florida, man. So typical. Anyway, I better get to my story here. George Soros is atheism fuels conservative rates. They're pissed off and fired up and I'm glad. I say let's hire George for prison. George Soros. Conservatives are fuming over the 15 and a half million dollars that billionaire finance here in philanthropist George Soros is pledged to the feet president Bush, but they're also anxious to fight back and expose what they considered to be Soros immoral beliefs and atheists leanings. Oh, right. Several prominent conservatives told CNSNews.com that Soros's moral bankruptcy would prove disastrous for the Democratic Party. The liberal groups that have benefited from Soros's gifts America coming together move on.org and set up from American progress are run by Democrats and have a close allegiance to the party's candidates. Soros immigrated from hungry in 1956 later became an actualized U.S. citizen has expressed outrage at the Bush administration's foreign policy, especially its decision to invade Iraq. Soros and its foundation the open society institute OSI thought a way strict philosophy that runs counter-dabushes objectives. The idea behind Soros's open society these ideas appeal the anger among conservatives the OSI's website states innocently enough that his it's objectives include the strengthening of civil society economic reform education at all levels human rights legal reform and public administration median communications public health and arts and culture. Soros has given away nearly five billion dollars in his lifetime while a significant portion of that money has been spent on pro-democracy movements overseas some of it has gone or liberal causes in USA. From abortion rights groups to drug reform initiatives, Soros domestic funding generally unze up in the hands of liberals. The subproclaimed atheist also created a project on death in America to generate debate about the dying process and alleviate unnecessary suffering. Among the beneficiaries of Soros' largest is the Center for Reproductive Rights, the pro-abortion group that recently saw its internal strategy plotting memos publicized by a pro-family group and if the request of US representatives of Chris Shays included in the congressional record. A Chris Smith of New Jersey. Conservative commentator Armstrong Williams and authority on Christian values said Soros wants to destroy the values on which the US was founded. Williams called Soros morally bankrupt and he wants the US just to department to investigate his contributions. He hates God and his biblical principles. He hates everything that's godly what you said. He's jumping up and down as the thought that same sex merges could happen in his country. It's a direct assault on the church, the institutions that restrain a restrict our behavior and remind us of the standard of morality and moral absolutes. Other conservatives were just as harsh. The right-wing alluded to Reverend Louis P. Sheldon found her in Chairman of the traditional values coalition, said Soros had to be taken seriously because he's the daddy warbox of everything we do not believe in. No one knows what demons drive us to Soros to consistently fund anti-emer anti-family agendas, said Robert Knight, directed the culture and family institute, at concerned women for America. But he seems determined to turn the world upside down and replace morality with immorality. For much of his life, Soros shied away from public attention and wasn't until after his quantum fund became a huge success on Wall Street that he began to devil in philanthropy at about the age of 50. As a child and teenager, Soros was profoundly shaped as a Jew living in Nazi occupied hungry, his father Tidadar protected George's mother Eris Vett and brother Paul by obtaining false identities for them, at 14 Georgia assumed the identity of a Christian was separated from his parents. I would say that's what my character was made Soros in the 60 minutes interview in 1998. A biography of Soros by former New York Times reporter Michael D. Cuffman detailed the experience. When George was six years old his father changed the family name from a shorts to Soros to protect the family from the threat of Nazi policies targeting Jews. After surviving the threat of Nazi as a Soros parents, had to endure a Soviet let-commoness take over of Hungary, the eventually fled the country in the United Wood Georgia's brother in America. While these experiences shaped Soros as an individual he grew fond of the open society philosophy, while studying at the London School of Economics, their scholar named Carl Popper would become Soros mentor and influence his thinking of open societies. According to Coppence's biography, Soros was born a Jew but only began to take an interest in religion when he was about 12 years old. He had a bar mitzva a year later. Several of Soros relatives became Christian but as time were on, Soros' own faith on a higher being faded. In a 60 minutes interview, Soros' enmity was not religious and did not believe in God. I'll pause there and do the break because we believe in commercials. Don't we? We believe in making cash. That's our God at QAM. Absolutely. For a 27 a QAM, it's that time of year again.

There's no best football there, all all strike. Let's burn a place down, and ensure it can for sure be nice. I think the only problem is that the town center mall is that the same as the local town center. Or yeah, the sales parking lot, it's gonna be. There's only one series, huh? That's it. Maybe he pulled my Scott Junior on us, maybe he's lost. Have we heard from him again? No. There you go. So either one or two things he did, we gave up any luck because there was no action or he's in the end of his vote. Nice God Mark. Like I said, we don't know anything about Joe Mark. We have no idea who they are. He invited my George Cero story. His feelings about Israel generally run counter to traditional Jewish thought in his new book, The Bubble of American Supremacy. Cero's takes his swipe at his ready Prime Minister Ariel Sherone, whom he blames as much as Palestinian leader Yester Arifet, for the violence in the Middle East, perpetrators on our own charge on both sides, Cero's wrote. And he's right. At a Jewish funders network appearance in November, Cero's remarks on Israel and Antisemitism during angry response from the anti-deformation league, but that controversy died down after critics looked at the full context of his comments, said Michael Vaishone, Ceros Aide. Sheldon, Louis Sheldon, obnoxious head of the traditional bad news coalition, remained critical of his views on Israel. He said Bush's strong alliance with Israel could partly explain Ceros' desire to see the present defeat in next year. Vaishone disagreed and noted that Ceros's proud of his Jewish heritage, he said the attacks from conservatives are unwarranted, adding that Ceros has done more good for people in the world than most critics realize. In Ocean, at somehow George Ceros' and immoral character Isopra Pasta's Vaishone said, one doesn't even know how to begin the answers such a ludicrous charge. It's an outrageous claim when you look at the record of the man's life and what he's done. A former consultant, the Ceros Foundation, David Wife, said conservatives appear to be holding Ceros to a double standard. Wife compared Ceros to Richard Melon's scape, a wealth and conservative was funded projects frequently criticized by liberals and who's the man behind the scenes at the Fudge Report by the way also. He's putting his money where his mouth and as far as they conserved in the described where I've said apparently they can dish it out that they can't take it, like good capital list they thought it was the right of rich people to fund the activities that they believed in. A mayor conceited to be fully informed about Ceros had Robert McGinnis, a former vice-president the family research counsel of the ultra-right wing family research counsel, where research Ceros' philosophy while working there. Ceros' put his money where his beliefs are, and that's the American way McGinnis said, their radical and my estimation would be certainly has made a value effort across the globe. He had a citizen's need to be worried of the fact that he's embracing a pro-drug anti-life agenda. The capital research center which tracks the anthropists like Ceros found that the open society institute has a pattern of giving to liberal groups that support drug legalization, youth and Asia, immigrant entitlements and feminism. There's a consistent threat to everything he does to John Curlow editor of the Center's organization Transit Foundation watch, he's a devout secular ideologue. He's a nation that now is at Ceros as a secularist. He also said the billionaire could handle the attacks from conservatives, but Patron said Ceros concerns extend beyond Bush. He believes the concept of an open society in the U.S. is threatened. He's giving money to a group that wants to see the incumbent Republican president defeated next election, Patron said, a lot of people are going to attack him. He's hardly surprised by it. You go George, nice going, baby. Good man. And he's also not a good guy bull crap. Any likes a little Delhi once in a while? He probably likes a good postromy on Ryan. Maybe some kisskey, maybe some potato lock is it to this time of the year. Maybe even some of the Pacific candy. How come we, when I was in a difference between between kosher candy for Hanika and Pacific candy, there you go, for Passover. Don't know, do you? It's all about the yeast. Now, seriously, there's no yeast in candy. What's the, oh, now maybe you're right. Get out. Here, there's no yeast like in hard candies. Almost had me suck it in there for a second. I don't know what that's all about. Just another Jew thing. Beard and son, bearded, son, doll for sale, barely 24 hours after catching. You got to get yours. In fact, maybe the panthers want to get some people in that game that I see have worked really good with that, with that rumor, the yeast doll that bubble had doll? They originally had 15,000 plus, but I might be okay, I'm on a Saturday night, whenever given out the bubble had dolls. Maybe you could answer me that question. Why is it that people who say that the tickets are too expensive? Or they don't have any interest or the team sucks? Why is it when they give away those free bubble had dolls? Now they have big crowds. Because they're collectors items. I see. Specialists floppy hatch for the Mullins games. Mm-hmm. Gotta have yours. Anyway. I got mine. Americans can now buy a heavily bearded doll of the defeated dictator. The doll comes complete with a shaggy beard and ace of spades, t-shirt, a reference to the US most wanted deck. The side admits that first you might not recognize this action figure US soldiers didn't recognize them either with his ratty here and wild beard. The website also has an action figure of Sodom with a mustache which can be fitted with SNN gear in Northridgeard. The creator of the Sodom doll reportedly said it may have a voice of its own in the future. That all cost? Guess what? Bop, turn it man. It's gonna be purchased online at www.herobuilders.com. Gonna get yours? No. Come on. Hero Builders. No. Come. Let me say it again and don't interrupt. Herobuilders.com. Not for you, maybe we got some people out there with a sense of humor. It would make kind of a need gift, huh? Anyway, Phil and muggates has had a leading lunch that they almost puked while reading an article by the obnoxious right when he scumbag Kathleen Parker on the opinion page of the scum Sentinel. This asshole bro had a great full goro was to do the experiment for his endorsement of Howard Dean and added this bizarre paranoid delusion. A to exact revenge on Clinton, as to why he did it. Exact revenge on Clinton B. Goro loves Dean because Dean can get goro a Supreme Court nomination or position in Dean's cabinet as a vice president. What? A position in Dean's cabinet as vice president right he's gonna be VP again right. Goro is setting himself up for the 2008 presidential race or D. Leaveerman was an upstandy moral man and that outspoken critic of Bill Clinton's marital vaguences. The she continues belly it can about how Goro betrayed you leaveerman. I think Ms. Parker has been popping out of the content with rush or maybe just sniffing rushes ass. I don't know what to do it. I feel that would do it. It's well not smelly or that come in. What do I get lost all of that weightiness hearing when you think we have any ideas about that rush? Alfax's and says is real a screen to choose a course but American need to Middle East policy made in the USA not in Tel Aviv or at a pack or AEI. President Bush and restate US support for the survival of his real but also register America's discuss with your own duplicitous policy of creeping annexationism. I like that. And repression while talking of peace do you ever hear that word before annexationism? Or maybe just annexation. Shuron to be told a vacator resettlement and not post-put ups and bush to a office and tear down any part of his new wallet and encroaches on the land of the coming nation of Palestine else American aid stuff. Yeah I don't understand what they're waiting for on that. You like that three billion year? Well guess what? Cut the crap. Cut the crap now or by by. But instead what do they get?

But I like the number I should have played at last week after my growtesky experience with those Akans bars man don't do it again. Mike one of our good facts just says I was wondering if you're about the tragic death of Keith Magnison. Oh yes it did Mike happen the two days ago. Rob Ramaget keep Magnison we're driving back to Toronto and Rob had a little bit too much to my daughter to a horrendous wreck and it's been a big story here. Keith Magnison is dead in Rob Ramaget being charged with the DUI. Make go to jail as for as long as life. Former Maple Leaf Captain Rob Ramaget was one of the last players by the way to play without a helmet. Did you know that about you didn't you did? Sure. Who was the last player in the NHL to play without a helmet? I'll even give you his initial CM. Craig McTavish. There you go very good. Let's hear from the base. Alright. You little help and I am really hurt. I'm sitting here during the break and I'm thinking about that story you told about Mo and it just slowly sinking in. See this should give the audience a better perspective, a better understanding of the kind of creature. It's a person but that would be like a really an insult to all persons. The kind of creature that we're dealing with, you know what I mean? Absolutely. Because everybody and this is a tankerous old man. We think of the word can tankerous. You think immediately of Mo. Everybody who rubs him in a wrong way which of course is everybody in the world sooner or later. He's got a call like Joe Rose with that famous call. Or you. He's called Hank. The hump or yes more than a more than a monocation than a load. Never called me though and that's a good idea. Good thing in mode do not be calling me ever. Let me give him your number. Well you know I'll tell you what no do not underpettle you. That's you know what he would hear right away. So as I recognize his voice. Yeah. The watch the charge. Pete D'Alton that's what you hear. I mean the idea and I just I'm trying to imagine in my mind the. The tone of the call. There was when it started you answer your phone. This is on your cell phone. But I was taking an app one day. Right. And the phone rings and I didn't recognize numbers. So I figured I'd pick it up because who knows who it could be. And I hear him in his car. And he's telling me that that I've single hand. No, wait a minute. How how how how do the call start? What did he say? He sound hostile right off the bat. Oh yeah. Was that it up? Yeah. I mean he always sounds hostile. Did he save this his mole? No, he didn't use that term. And he he he continued to just say that I had single handily turn his audience on. I'm that when I'm out and about when I'm at Cames games. I tell everyone that he's an asshole and that that they shouldn't listen to him and they should call him up and call him an idiot and all the stuff that all the bad nuggets that listen to his show and call in are all my fault. Really? Yeah. In the other words, the idea that he's an asshole is something that you planted and everybody's mind as opposed to everybody perceiving that from his behavior last year and a half a QAM. It's the beast fall. And then I still say that the where he tried actually after trying to get me can and destroy my career and try to get George can and all the other crap that he pulled behind the scenes. To think that he was going to like, oh my new best friend I'm QAM, the a ride bubble. And because he couldn't take on me and Joe at the same time. But I will say pound for pound now. He is doing a much bigger chore taking on me and the load, the total and the load in the afternoon. Take it as close back as same time. So pound for pound was he's really bitten off probably more than he can chew if he catch my drift. Oh yeah. Man. So and of course if we throw you into the mix, my god. He's been doing it two on for next 10 years. Yeah. The old moments do we hate you, my like poison and you are an asshole and everybody knows it, including all the people you work for before you came to QAM. Nice higher Greg.

The FCC is determined that attorney general John Ascroft's unsuccessful 2007 Re-election campaign, you know what you mean against the dead guy? Violent election laws by accepting $110,000 in illegal contributions from a committee Ashcroft had established to explore running for president. In documents released yesterday by the FCC, Garrett M.

How do you like that? The FCC vote to find Ashcroft committee was $5.01 and a one-to-center sought harsh penalties and to her findings. How do you like that?
