That's what's agreed more thought that's tonight on animal planet emergency Betts a by the buy and these animal bowel movements. Oh my god. He's got fruit coming out the was who what? I meant the tiger 10 18 at five 60s big of that illusion is Roy Horne of sick freedom Roy was moved yesterday to a two day. How come the story took so long get into a CBS news? I don't know to a new hospital almost a month after a tiger attacked him during that sold out performance as people said Horne 59 had been and who gave you these numbers to fangs me by the way doubt I thought my final you could do it's we'd already pulled him out of his ass Back to him. Oh man What I touched them. Oh, and here's monthlies and Yeah, it's a good thing I've only got the copies because he pulled these obviously right out of his act We could probably also use the numbers for big so we could see how it's sperm digging Civil life in morning Paul and old Ron kicked a for else ass Can you believe that? I'm just buried in stuff here you ought to see this. I got buried in crap buried in a sea of crap What a way to go though? Horne 59 have been intensive care of university medical center in Vegas till he was transferred to an LA medical facility UMC's Nevada's only top level trauma center Pulices Dave Kurvin declined to say where he was taken or discuss his condition in other words. They're not talking I'd be like that if you want to see an actual photo of the tiger attack of tickers attack on a Roy You can go to our website yourrangers.com and see an action Figure going on there. It's a beautiful thing Roy. Why it's the funniest thing ever. It's the best thing in history here's for Lauderdale. Hello Good man. Yeah, I love you. Yeah, Sam When I talk to you about that book What book is that the South Beach diet? Oh, no Here's a thing Neil. Um, I respect your opinion and I I call it the book and the the puff piece about the South Beach Northwest they don't need any advertising as far as Austin's fair, but I mean I never bought a I never bought a diet book to follow a Reptitive book every day book that's ever made and here's and here's much to here's life take on it I don't care about I don't care about recipes. I don't follow the recipes, but it really It educated me on you know the How your body reacts to certain things and I mean I never thought about your act Seriously, but I'm gonna ask you something that I'm assuming you have way to lose, right? Yeah, well when you said educated you on something what what kind of a diet is it when it all it has There's a bunch of recipes it doesn't give you any guidelines it doesn't say what to huh? It does Where's that? Um, right before the recipes it tells you listen to Right before the recipe that tells you what you can and what you can't have now I can see getting discouraged about all those stupid ass recipes because most of the stuff sounds like crap Anyone I wasn't making or feel there and eat it anyone No, no, no wait a minute for Jay you're talking about where says foods to enjoy and foods to avoid But that doesn't really give you any guidelines. This is just basically a whole bunch of revenues Well again, I didn't go by the menus. I went by the guideline and You know reading how your body reacts to certain things how real sugar right Good, but we don't see but you never bought any other diet book. I was just jumping on every every other diet book That's ever been written will give you the glycemic index It'll give you all the stuff so I'm an answer about time beatings in about carbs and we find carbs 95% of diet books will tend to all of that stuff. There's nothing revolutionary You still got to raise it and I agree with you the book is probably crap in a way It's just a rip off of pumpkins man. It's the most flagrant rip off ever seen the only thing He says is what latkins recommends too much saturated fat and an official It's just a lot for an akin to the I don't know if you have to do I never follow a diet. I probably like you You know I'll break that against a fish with ice cream or something else Yeah, I'm actually able to follow you know that you know what I'm going to do In other words you're losing weight on it. I lost like 10 pounds and I don't like go off the diet And eat hot crispy cream don't look like I want It just has it's helped me but like you said you could buy another diet book Yeah, basically do exactly the same thing. You know what the key is though if it works for you keep it up Exactly like just like you said it would be with the ass and diet and what I'm buying the Fun part of the diet is the only rip off all the recipes because honestly as you ever fall in your recipe and diet But no How that help could you how could anybody in a right mind especially a man how can unless you're a gourmet cook? How could anybody almond ricotta cream You've got all these eating five degrees oriental cabbage salad with the five different ingredients and Somebody some of the recipes knew you're going to have like 20 different ingredients to make it I wouldn't do it but just just In closing as far as that the dessert is there and I sugar from jello I mean it works for me. Yeah, yeah, I get a little sweet. You know little stuff something and it works for me But there's a lot of the recipes. I'm really nasty. I would try to stir it behind it Seriously the theory behind it is a good idea If you never had a bad cook rip out all the recipes and it'll take you to eat something else Okay, keep it up. Okay, okay Okay, look at this Dill drill trim center with herb drill dressing Just in the shrimp. There's two for their six ingredients there and the herb drill dressing two four six eight Who do we appreciate 10? I love 12 ingredients there so you talked about almost 20 ingredients just to make their recipe Yeah, nobody in our mind is gonna do that you ever make billbread and as far as the foods to enjoy and foods to avoid There's nothing new there. There's nothing revolutionary This is acenes all over again only he throws in a few more vegetables that's all and not quite so much Heavy on a fat it's just modified anacons There's nothing at all new in here like I said it. I mean all died books have got some recipes in here, right? Oh, I've got a little bit of that But I would say about I mean From after the first 100 pages in here the whole rest of the guy damn book is nothing but a bunch of guy damn recipes It's a rip off how much is this piece of crap 24 out of five US 34 95 Canadian aid that I wasted my money on Jesus Christ in Joseph and it's the South Beach diet Now and I said bread to one country hand. He's probably the only one we've got the book in our audience I'm glad it's doing well for him, but for me forget about it. I'm just I'm Fulming at the bottom so tired of fat people including me being exploited by people want to pedal some goddamn book Whether it's Suzanne summers, you know, I don't I don't to be grudge doctor bomb because he's dead Right now and he wasn't a nice guy. You're right. He was kind of a shmit head in a real arrogant But but the fact that a matter is he was way ahead of his time right how many years ago he came up with a concept I think the idea that these refined carbohydrates turned to sugar in your body and they're gonna kill you and he's right He was absolutely right and now that now that he's dead, they're saying oh, you know what it really works Oh, what a deal and you're trying to summarize come way down and you're above your car cholesterol comes way down without taking those dangerous statin drugs in fact that's another thing This doctor and here he's he's piloted out in those statin drugs He takes him Dr Arthur Agotson you remember Dr McColle kill McCulle in whatever his name was yeah Yeah, with a homo-sistine in the follow-pholic acid He tells you about the uh, not those they're killing you Allers the statin drugs a zoco or in the lovestatin and the premise statin and the up your ass statin Statin island all of that crap all of these things what am I getting worked up about? I'm just I'm just tired of people being exploited because we're fat give us something give us something to eat There you go. Yeah, give us something good a dammit to how it all is other crap True feel buckless legs went that round rollings ball He has topped up its form from bad to worse and it's low because of the bamboo curse The red thoughts had it made Sweet new they made that they've written Why you're the running job and the Traditionary under Boston it just has joke 10 30 at five 60 W to Q I am happy a Thursday to it don't forgive a y'all's out there now We'll want to clock ding and then solutions three 70s out that see how in northeast corner Lzun us one first 10 people to make the $20 donation of the a band of per rescue and get some of our crap Get a per tickets to the heat the tried pistons gained or an eye opening night at the Mickey Eris and Arena 1 to 422 arena's in stadiums were gonna be having a bond day county very soon So let's see now a mole actually beat old Ron and young Paul In that the first hour can you believe that I need the numbers for big would be helpful month that would be really good those hourlies for big WB GG I don't think we can see Howard sperm and who's side by Hsibram saying what would be nice sure? Did you see the whopping September that we had? Yeah, pretty huge Huh pretty huge on that's 10 to three right eight point nine. I mean we did over a nine Well, that's nothing new we always used to do that now that we're back in 10 to two not We're back in a right time a lot another Greg is coming back to his senses So don't be dicking around with it no mole this year in fact this coming here. That's a new year's resolution for 2004 Don't mess with a line up no mole Next good idea. Okay. No, seriously just at least to the next year leave it alone don't keep tinkering and tinkering And screw it around the audience likes familiarity even if it's somebody they hate look at mole Absolutely can't stand it but now they's been there for a while or like warming up to him a little bit not much 5.3 in a six o'clock hour and the Ron and ancient Paul who hate me like poison and by the way the feeling is mutual and You're still like a higher your up hall 5.5 oh we beat him like a little bit then they just kick ass look at at 6 9 at 7 o'clock 7 48 As opposed to most week 4 7 and the for else 5 8 and 5 3 you follow those numbers No, so from 7 a 10 they just kicked our ass So that's something to be said for them. I have no idea why I know show what I think Promote because it's on at them That might have something to do with it as in flying mantras So we'll get those a big numbers. I'm sure I'm sure that Muck is working on it feverously right now Fox sports they didn't do squat they had two zmedicus of our non sports show so the sports nerds some of them Over there, but other than that they didn't do crap a boy we sure had an impressive September all the way around. That's nice Now let's see here's a look Should we dispense with that chronic in mirror mar here's mirror mar hello? I'm calling about a disability something about the S.F.D.S.D.S diet Yeah, a friend of mine while I work his mother actually wrote it And the doctor that's on the book name Yeah, he just bought it for Marcia. He doesn't even really you didn't even come up with this thing It's just some normal lady that uh just kind of changed around the act and died you know I mean so it's all absolutely That's what I was it thanks for the info pali How why did you put chronic on there? We never heard from that guy before Oh, I know I'll stop put him on her because he's trying to get my attention because he wants to thank the holiday of police department Yeah, yeah, he never's to say something I'm giving it that opening you could drive a Mac truck through with there You have a freight train which they never stole through it. Yeah, they're still all right with us. Okay A lot of words he got the impact both Scott Scott speeding tickets this morning our Scott and for all both got speed I go past them I I mean what's the speeding ticket what do you give you ticket for being a leader alien also being redress? Thank you pardon now this is this is interesting George and company It's a renewal and company. It's a good morning Good morning. I have a poll idea for you. Maybe you think so too. Most embarrassing moment Yani, yeah Mitch and son right not bad Mitch and son right. I'll put it under my pile of polls under my poll pile I was starting to say before we get interrupted by Scott who wants to suck up to the hell in the police don't suck up too much Any Rosenberg will sick him on your ass okay, and then you really be in deep crack. I'll make a note of it The interesting part about our poll against the Harold poll Now there's a poll on a Harold website which I'm assuming was in the esports section of the paper Or maybe it's one of those polls that's only on their website. I don't know But obviously it appeals to the sports nerds because you have to click sports and go to the sports crap in order to get courts right and the question they ask is should the marlins get a new stadium 310 people voted as of about an hour ago when I printed this on No way they don't need it 145 5% but you know this should the Marlok and his damn they're not saying how they're gonna get it Who's gonna pay for it so the question is worded week? Although not with taxpayer money 811 26% sure they did so well I don't mind paying right 151 34% and only if they don't dismantle the team 113 votes 35% so the Positive 69% to 31 You see what I'm saying 60% say oh, yeah sure sure As long as they don't take the team apart and they're willing to lose that extra $40 million Last season which I'm really a dubious about that our poll we had 1159 votes Which is pretty good considering it's only one little crappy AM radio show and a god-day and prestigious Harold had 310 votes see? Not too bad really Plus a lot of our people can't vote on this thing cuz a lot of our people are fools They have a well. I'm sorry about that get with a give it a a well. They suck it Who should pay for a new stadium for the marlins? We asked 1159 votes only the team on his 513 44.2% almost half people said oh, yeah, they want to build it great We'll maybe show up and maybe not blue cares No stadium no way Jose 180 people 15.5% the suckers in date 166 14.3% only people who don't speak English on earth 164 14.1% the taxpayers only 79 That's only 6.8% of our audience. Oh, yeah one of the taxpayers should pay for the stadium and Only the people of the games 57 4.9% out of 159 now some of the people would respond by saying well That's because it's your show Neil and you're so negative Well, what is the last time that anything that I had to say had anything to do with the result on our poll? I mean once in a while I would read with the result, you know the end result of the polls No, usually they they vote the opposite just to be bastard. No, no, I mean they vote however They were and they feel they're all anonymous. It's anybody who's out there in radio land They don't follow the leader they own coup step along. I only wish that I could go step them along What did I mention that we beat the crap out of rush Not it I glossed by this which I shouldn't have done I still don't have those big ourlies which I'm sure you know It's a little beyond myself. They're cooking them up right now. Are they cooking them?

You know what else he said? We want the world series. That's what he said wait And people couldn't but they were a gas they were shocked at the sound of that boy. We want the world series They were just their their eyelids were drooping Miami City manager Joe Ariola said yesterday the name change has been part of the negotiations all along It has to be Miami Marlon's and that's all there is to a the agreed with it. It's a bet that's it like it or not stuff it Miami date mayor Alice Pinga Piccini has said any stadium deal will be predicated on changing name from Florida to Miami So I guess we have to have the Browork white if that's the case. Let's play hard ball hard puck right Scott sure about the the Broward Panthers Right, right Or the sunrise how about the sunrise Panthers then aren't as in a city of sunrise Yes sunrise Panthers they really blow They're gonna be let's all get together and go what they're gonna be the Sanders tonight.

That's one of the reason so many people listen It was given a selector about well, you know there's four billion dollars a year for the brigade County School The story about by the umptious buddy nevens at today's son Sentinel lack of money delays maillings of 80,000 Broward voter cards. I realize that's in Broward, you know It's just a classic example of the kinds of things that we don't have money for in dating Broward and Palm Beach and all over the In place so get your priorities straight now is what I was suggest here's today's poll question What song is so annoying you never want to hear it again? Now I don't I really probably shouldn't say What inspired me for this poll? Oh come on If you just got through a plan with One of our fine spots is which I'm sure I don't know what to do with it I just I don't want to hear this no more, you know what I'm saying? Oh one more time with what one more time no this hour I'd rather I'd rather crow I'd rather go eat at the edge. Don't crash I'd rather go buy another coffee just a little bit I could do a couple of hours You know that hour or a horn Nothing worth an assala horn believe me Oh, I'm gonna play a lot with my comment paper Oh You Okay, that's enough. Oh man that was my choice. I don't want to hear it. I cannot stand it It's part of the whole pre-fabricated world that America has become everywhere you go Every stadium every venue even you go to a meal. Do you know somebody has a birthday party to start going to start playing that? Rock and roll part one Gary glitter and the other one that came to mind was promenery from CCR for back in my Zeta days. I added to Okay, let's hear what they are sweethold Alabama. Oh come on. I like sweethold Again, that's your choice. What up in the south? They just beat you the death sweet home. They like that in Tampa man. And Just a minute, I might need to download it. Skinner. I'm sure I spelled it wrong when I fact's it's Eric. I don't care and Funky town by let's think funky town. Yeah What where do you hear that? I heard that just never went away Why do you just don't like disco? That's your pro. I like to go a lot don't get me wrong. You don't like funky town I don't like funky town. Okay. There you go. There's a form to get you started Give it a word list and we'll put that up there. We can take the other one off of it Or you can get this thing going get this turkey going. Anyway, here's that story by the umptious obnoxious buddy nevens Election supervisor Miriam Olipen's office is so far behind in its work that new registration cards have been Males and mid July leaving about 80,000 Rao County residents without their voter identification 80,000 We have a backlog conceded Bruce Elridge. He lessons office director computer systems. He said the office ran out of money for the printing of registration cards and postage in mid July The office has fielded hundreds of angry phone calls from voters waiting months and months for their cards According to a state report released last week there was highly critical of Miriam Elephant The voter cards should begin to be male that connect with male in election now that the office has received money from the County Commission for new fiscal year that began October 1, Elridge said newly registered voters and those who changed the regressor party affiliation will need the cards to vote in the Special Prime election Florida House District 91 in January 6 and the general election January 27 This by the way is the same office that we had the story a couple of days ago have been setting out extra ballots Some people Like two or three or some people go Got a little while it mail it the extra one to somebody that didn't get theirs Also waiting for new cards or voters in as many as 50 precincts that have been changed because the old polling places didn't accommodate the disabled or the landlord no longer Wanted to make the property available Elephant did not of course return her calls to her office for comment. How do you like that? One of those waiting is Jay Marcus 18 of plantation his mother Sharon Marcus had a son registered to vote in May When the card didn't arrive she began calling elections office and was told there was a backlog They said there was no money no money no money sure Marcus we call three times in her no money Mitch Myers a plantation went to the elections office more than two months ago to switch his registration event Dependent to Republican badmow Mitch he never received a new card tank on his so he visited the election office earlier This month asked what happened? He was told the card was printed but couldn't be male the him is required by law because of lack of money He still don't have it. My or said which is good because he's a Republican now But how do you like that? lack of money 80,000 people in Broward still waiting for their voter cards What's that mean what's 80,000 votes in there? I've got that you know such honest elections So there you go. There's just one example out of thousands and thousands and thousands of examples in day Broward Palm Beach every damn county in a mirror her This really this really cracks me up Miami officials zeroing in an orange bull as a area side of the stadium Right, possible new sites are being checked out for the Florida suit of me Miami Marlins But the talk keeps returning to one spot the orange bull you go. Love the tea rooms. They're out of that SUNY manager Joe area. Alla said yesterday the area around the orange bull and perhaps the stadium itself Which university mommy football team calls home is a top contender. It's a contender It's a big consideration. We could fix the orange bull rearranged the orange bull build next to the orange bull or probably a better idea just blow that Anything up Howard David's a bitch good morning owner home lies at the heart of the American dream It serves as the foundation of many Americans financial security and the good news is this less than half of all African Americans and Hispanic Americans are homeowners We must prevent minorities from owning a piece of the American dream So I have asked the Congress to join me in creating a second obstacle to minority home ownership Permanent complexity and difficulty of the purchasing process But government action is enough that is why I've challenged the real estate industry leaders to join with the government In a major nationwide effort to increase obviously but unscrupulous lenders with an overriding In urgent mission prevent minorities from owning a piece of the American dream and we are doing just that Thank you for listening.

We don't want to rain on their parade thankfully no retractable roof was needed on a clear day But we have to wonder if we'll see so many baseball fans converging on Miami-Discune for the Marlins ever again Would they consistently pack a new downtown ballpark or would they jump off this band wagon as quickly as they jumped on? Would they turn off to see baby faced Miguel Corbura and rifleman Josh Beckett who plans to begasmonyed? Do you now he did the Yankees last week? If we build it would you come with the question that crystallized and state representative for Alpharza's mind Monday night He put it on a poster board and Miami City Commissioner Jose Sanchez held it up to the crowd paying homage to the Marlins at the Bayfront Park amphitheater Yes, we will they cheer it Now that would be a sight even more amazing than these Marlins The fickleness of south Florida's fans is what our government leaders have to weigh very seriously Even as they work out the details of the Marlins owner Jeffrey Lory on a tentative stating financing plan that was announced Tuesday night There was no denying that this is a lousy sports town South Koreans may shake their tan fannies at Chicago, Boston, Detroit or New York but people are support their teams Rainer shine Snored drizzle winter lose is at the target We should be so lucky to have Steve Barman and our stands we could use a few thousand more die hearts The Marlins heat and panthers don't draw unless they're winning The University of Miami football team only the best in the country for most of the two decades doesn't draw less it's playing a name opponent We lost a fusion soccer club which was supposed to be an old brainer with our diverse demographics We lost the WNBA soul, our college basketball team struggles to fill seats The offense have always been solid we like NASCAR NASDAQ tennis and golf tournaments but those come in bursts What about the long haul over a 162-V in baseball season?
