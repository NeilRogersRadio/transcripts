But in 2020, my god, my biggest parents pay. Just coming out of your allowance, son. Because it's lovely, go to take music without paying on me another man. Everybody does it. Now live, don't buy these face and charges, and he's not out of a bit brave yet. I suppose if Billy jumped off the Brooklyn Fringey, he would jump out of a tiny, tops in trouble, and he's got no idea what he's done. He was using a tiny body. They treated him like he was a kite, oh, kids, who's thirsty. And he's still stealing Bobby's wrong. And the lesson to be learned is when you should know from the day you're born. I'm not reading a cellulose and a me don't get caught down Lord. Music, save your distress, and a report, born. There you go. There's a best advice you ever had, Bobby. 1018 at 5.60 WDQM happy Friday 2. So it's raining here that I mentioned that. Yeah, I mentioned that. It's raining. I love this little thing you passed along. I'm here for one of our astute listeners. It says an elementary teacher starts a new job at a school in Tallahassee. And trying to make a bit impression on her first day explains to her class that she's an FSU fan. She asked the class to raise their hands if they too are FSU fans. Everyone in the class raises their hands and said one little girl. The teacher looks a little surprised and says, Mary, why didn't you raise your hand? Because I'm not a seminal's fan. She said, the teacher asked, well, if you're not a seminal's fan, then who do you support? I'm a gator fan in proud of it. Mary replied, my teacher now became interested in the loan to center ask, Mary, why are you a gator fan? Because my mom and dad went to UF and my mom is a gator fan and my dad is a gator fan, so I'm a gator fan too. Well said, the teacher and I, and obviously an oil tone, that's not necessarily a reason for you to be a gator fan. You don't have to be just like your parents all the time. What if your mom was a prostitute and your dad was a drug addict and a curthy? What would you be then? Mary said, I'm your hurricane's fan. Hi, guys. I'm fucking blow. Yeah. Nice going, Mary. I was so much bill. That's billin' for a lovelier. I'll not to want to hate George or boy in another bill. Thanks, girl. I just want to jump. I know for good. Hi, guys. I'm fucking blow. Make no mistake about that. Whether the name is a bell or any other. Whatever the name. Vinny. Geno. Remember Geno, Toretta? Sure. Yeah. That's you, dude. He's the only 85-year-old quarterback that I were played in an American University. Here's a, your friend PR Ralph says, we're the Puerto weekend people support Jorge, a job well done. Now you have money to pay the weed debt or else take our Thomas Los Oamos and congratulations. It's his PR Ralph. You're close, personal, me go to it. I think everybody in the audience ought to be calling in all you skeptics out there. All you people let bust little George's balls all the time. I mean, okay. So he didn't do like spectacitary did very, very well. He did great. Not, you know, a super sensation like double digits, like Neil. Like Neil sometimes does. But nevertheless, see, here's what a lot of these assholes don't understand. First of all, the best of Neil tapes suck. They're done. You will not hear those no more. Maybe I'm like some holiday when we have like Christmas day. We got nothing else to put on. No, you okay right now? On this day, shit. He sucked. They're outdated. They're put together very slack. I said, or I'll be before we get back to that. Do we have an up there? Hey, Tascos. I know the answer is going to be from yesterday. No. I mean, I'm not yesterday and not a new one today. No. How about your pardon? You talk about money, right? Right. No, not a new one. Because I want to see us get to 25 grand by the end of the day. Today, I'm going to be really porked off and a really sour mood to rest of the weekend. We're going to be a little bit of that until after that appearance. After what appearance? The one that's afternoon. Why don't have nothing on that either? That's on your fact, pushing. That's why on the fact machine. You mean now? Right now, if you reach over there, it is. I've just reached over at some of our fast machine. Best in the old stuff this afternoon. I don't know how Joe and Mark did that yesterday, but they usually do just a few bucks. I have a limit. How much? I don't know. I was yelling at my gal to come back in here. Yeah, come on, Miguel. Get with it. You're doing such a horseball job this year. I know do we need to get service to least once an hour, but we're going to put that thing away from it. Let's find out what's going on here. This is really sloppy. How much? 40. I must have heard wrong. He just shouted it out over the inner con. They raised $40. Are you serious? I'm sure I heard wrong. Are you sure? $40. 40 and he just got cut off. How much? I don't know. Pretty sure he said 40. You know, something serious. They have joined Mark raised only $40 for the abandoned pet rescue. Would have all of our good merchandise yesterday. Would have seen ease and more hard day than absolute change. I'm going to be so pissed at them and I know what they got. Well, I have nobody listening. But nobody shows up unless you're on the air promoting it at the time. You see. That's who. Well, so what's going to happen tomorrow between three and five today. To sack to know, George will be at Fort Lauderdale Harley on federal highway just south of Oakland Park Boulevard with prizes. Oh, yeah, those really heavy duty QA and prizes. Sure. Atlantic City subs from our good friends at Atlantic City subs. Dickens, cider energy, drinks and whatever else so we can give away. Plus our best in the emerge and I should be there three different. Five this afternoon, George had Fort Lauderdale Harley and we we better get with it. Right. It's a good place to go the Fort Lauderdale Harley shop nice close and there's always lots of brawls, babes running around the store. All right. Really, really. I'll be down. I shot you not. I guess I've had a turn on a playboy channel momentarily just to get everybody to read the previous. Come see the Harley toys and ask them to see their two packed tattoos. Look at that. One of the bees who's playing a band join a background while she was trying to finger out what life is all about. It was. I think there was a Bruce Beesley here. So anyway, go see George this afternoon and help us out because Joe and Mark just stumped the join. I had you have any idea how mortifying that is to raise for it and I was joking when I said, I was pretty much had my thumb on it. It's like one CD and one key chain or two CDs or whatever it had held a pedal to yesterday. That's lame, Joe. God, all mighted it. I just walk away if I were them. I just walk away. So we'll give it a good shot. Give it a lame shot and we just nobody likes us. John, no one in three. Yeah, that's a good idea. Because if I were them after seeing that last book, it would be a friend. Be very afraid. That wouldn't be, you know, spend it my next paycheck nowhere, no more. Anyway, so that's to the O'Gocie Georgia Saptenone. Give us some money. But I started to say I think everybody naughty and so is you in apology. The ones at least the ones who are the naissers, we're always ripping you and ask about your ads. Especially that bill and for Lauderdale, not the one who facts us that cute thing moments ago. Maybe here's somebody the first call of the day is somebody's going to kiss your ass. Here's Miami, hello. Why are you so much a person? Yeah, we're going to kiss your ass and get it right on it on all fours. Boring, boring, soft or at least we got the hurricane here. The remnants of what we got a little Isabel. We got you got Selya Cruz, we got Isabel. See? And she's got better an anters on her head. Just rain in a little bit of wind nothing. Absolutely nothing here. Okay, here's our poll question today. Who's your all-time favorite dead musician as we consider compiling a guy continue compiling these polls of dead people just to piss off. Absolutely. Who's your favorite all-time dead musician? I could have filled out a whole bunch more on here, but then that would take away the opportunity for you to have some fun with it. Or not. John Lennon, Jim Morrison, Elvis Presley or Kurt Cobain as you really for names I put on there yet. So you have a chance to add to it. Then Monday, I don't know how we're going to word that one on Monday, you know? Which, the one the other. I put for people like, famous others. I like that. Not politicians, not musicians and not actors or actresses. I don't know how we're going to word that. Carefully. Well, we'll have to finger that on Monday. We'll give it. But we're talking about people like, you know, historical figures and vendors like Thomas Edison and here we are forward and Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Alfred E. Newman, people like that. In fact, we might actually put Alfred E. Newman on there now that you've come right down to it. Well, the Narlie guy from Mad Magazine was his name Ed Gaines or something like that. You know, Ed Gaines was the publisher. Yeah, that's what that's what I mean. He's that. Yeah, he's done. Love Mad Magazine. That's why we got Alfred E. Newman is president now. It's how popular that thing was. 26 past 10 at 5, 60 WDQM. If you're looking for a really great new place to eat breakfast lunch or dinner. How about thickeners from Rochester, New York, Wight and South Florida, and on for Loderdale? Ficcerners has been around since 1934 as a small child about 100 years ago. I loved it. And still do. Ficcerners is located on federal highway just south of Brad Bovard on the tunnel on the east sign. Ficcerners is a flashback in town, though it restaurants used to be before fast food. If you love those rutschers, they're white hots even if you never had to be for a guarantee. You love putting one of those in your posts. Go in and enjoy a burger hot dog served hot fresh and fast. Ficcerners is brought to for Loderdale by the same guys feeding a cheaper grachie burger. Ficcerners uses the same fresh 100% ground shock meat as cheaper grachie burger. And offers an incredible big juicy quarter pound hot dog. What makes Ficcerners different from anybody else in town? Cause their burgers and dogs are served with thick signature meat sauce. Port on top giving you a combination of flavors available no place else in the universe. If you're looking for something else to drive, Ficcerners has got all kinds of great dishes like a great breakfast menu. I'm let's cook the order French toast pancakes of your favorite side dishes too. Go buy a viccerners and see what all the talk is about why they were so popular in Rochester just like they are already in Fort Loderdale. Ficcerners on federal highway just south of Brad Bovard Bovard on the tunnel on the east side. Tell them that old ruckus theory in the aradios since your boss. I'm a man who is a sports winner of Ficcerners. You weigh him. Come on, come on, come on, come on, now tax me babe. Uncle San Pedro, I'm all in that I'm in. And while you're at it all the day, you're in so true in theory. Just take my personal baby. Now I'm taking the Dutch ice out of the old game. I'm gonna find some taxables just to make those wheels all spin. The irresist. Come on, come on, come on, now tax me babe. Tax my dog, tax my freaking to pay. Okay. Tax my patience, tax my sanity. And I'm gonna lose it anyway. I voted for Jim Morrison. You should win this full hands down your pants. No contest. All right, we have a facts from Anna and Fort Lauderele. Anna says I vote for Kurt Cobain. Will you have a lot of nerve, Anna? 1032 at 560W to QA and 56070560 pound 560. I probably shouldn't have done that, shouldn't. I couldn't resist. I just gonna help myself. I go ahead. Count five 60 on the AT&T. By the way, General Wesley Clark was at the Delhi day yesterday. Picking out. Are you jump bandwagon? You're pretty much still for Howard Dean. I realized that that makes me an old funny, dirty. And that I'm just not, you know, just not hip and whatever I'm supposed to be. I like Howard Dean a lot. Because he's got balls. Because he doesn't change, you know, for one minute to the next. He doesn't say one thing one day. And then when things go turn out to well, it says, you know, we're just not managing this thing all I want. Because Wesley Clark said that he probably would have voted for the congressional resolution, like, if all, authorizing the war. During his appearance at the highly touted Delhi, then, which used to be great in Hollywood, and is now pretty marginal. At best. Everyone in the Delhi, then used to be really great. Didn't one of the owners come into a side? There was something. So where is that? Yeah, I'm puzzled by the way, William Gaines. William Gaines was the publisher of Mad Magazine. But genius. How about Tom Martin? How about him? How about cheese, Dad? Why, why would you say that? You think Tom Martin's still alive? I do. How do you know that? We would have heard about that. I think we did. But at any rate, say you can't learn from all. There's so many. The reason I enjoyed doing these dead pull, well, I don't want to say enjoys not to write term, but the reason it's timely. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like they're dropping like flies like those. It's, uh, it's going on. Famous people, well-known people, whether it's the local scene like our friend, Don Cox, Passing Away a few days ago, or like, uh, nationally. First we had Gregory Peck and Kate Hippern, and then we had Johnny Cash and John Ritter, and their dropper like flies did. Dino behavior, man. So I think it's appropriate that we start honoring the dead people. Because, you know, after a few months, few years, it's like, uh, yesterday's mashed potatoes. You know, nobody wants to eat it. Bon Scott, AC DC singers, a great choice for your pull. Bon Scott, I know Bon Jovi. Yeah. I know Scott Beo. I don't know. Bon Scott. It says his voice was on kilotunes like Highway to Hell, dirty deeds, TNT, whole lot of rosy at all. Thank you so much. Thank you for whoever told it. I thought Bon Scott was in the acacia with the stones. I had his body on stick. He could be up there with the stones, most of them are dead, nobody told them or dead, nobody told them. Don't forget Frank. So not sure. Oh, Frankie Panky, that opens up a lot of bits I can play. The reason I just played that task, me, it's kind of a weak bit, but it's only doors when I think that we got in isn't it? Nothing. We have a people or strange ones somewhere here. We do? I, I, I don't know what you call people. Oh, we got peppy fields. She's dead. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I just hooked on to peepee. Wow. I don't know what to call me. Anyway, so what's his name? Was there Wesley Clark? He was in Hollywood at Kickoff, his official campaign. And we got a lot of, you know, bad wagon jumpers already and Florida and around the rest of the country to see it's not just the Democrats, but anybody who realizes that Bush is a mitigated liar and is surrounded by a bunch of real evil doers and ought to be impeached already. I mean, yeah, it comes to has a host, but there you look on our website today. You'll find some really interesting articles there, but what the, in fact, one of them uses the effort a few times. Guys, so pissed off. How can this man not be being impeached right now? Oh, well, no, we never said, saw them had nothing to do with 9-11. And then, well, no, he really had nothing to do with Al Qaeda. And, oh, there aren't a weapon to match destruction. This morning, they were announcing to us recklessly that they discovered that they had no small pucks, uh, get all right. So every every couple of days will, well, they didn't have any of this. They didn't have any of that. They didn't have any serengetes. They didn't have any serendipity and yati idea. And yeah. So what tells us all about? Shut up. Yeah, that's exactly. So anyway, we're getting a lot of band-barking jumpers. And what really disturb me and his article in the Washington Post that says, General Clark said his views on the war resemble those of democratic senators. Jewelie Bremen of Connecticut. And John the scary carry of both of whom voted for the war. But now question, President pushes stewardship of the Iraqi occupation. That having been said, I was against the wars that emerged because there was no reason to start it when we did. We could have waited. He said during a 75 minute session with former supporters while he was eating kishki. And probably lots of moths of bri. Now you don't need that this time of year. Like, or have moths of bri? Yes, I have. Oh, Clark. Now here's what I did. He sounded a little like Arnold to me. Clark said he has few specific policy ideas to offer voters right now. And offered a few thoughts that might surprise Democrats blocking his campaign. As recently as Sunday night, he was unsure if he should run for president. So Clark said voters need to give him time to think things through. See, if it's me. I got him and call me crazy. You're crazy. I know. But if it's me, I start thinking things through ahead of time and say, Hey, maybe I got some answers for things that will work like the economy and like this mess we got in Iraq and like the war on real terrorism and all of these things. As opposed to saying, hey, guess what I'm running. Now let me figure out what I want to do. Well, that's the way it works now. Here's a lady in Atlanta. Hello. Hey. How are you doing? Hey, Neil. This is Diane. Hi, Diane. I used to live down there in homestead through Hurricane Andrews. Wow. So then you got out. Yeah. Me too. All that. I'll catch you on the internet here at work. Excellent. And I just really, I've missed the end down there. Listen to you all the time. But I do get to here at work. Good. Have to about that. Excellent. My favorite musician. The dead is Elvis. Elvis. He's got you think he's been a win? Yeah. I don't know. But we got four names on there right now. And he's in last place. So he needs your help. Oh, okay. Well, I guess he does. The King needs your assistance, Diane. Absolutely. Absolutely. Can I say, hey, my brother. Sure, can. You're down there in plantation. You bet. All right. Hey, Robert. Have a great day. Diane. Nice hearing from you. Okay. You too. Goodbye. There's Diane. She's in Atlanta. Now she's starting to speak with him. Folks in Atlanta pretty soon. She'd be one of them. I hope not. And five, six, seven, oh, five, 60. Who is your favorite all-time dead musician? Now the early we put just the four names on there. We got look how many votes we got. God, third man. John, 11 and 14. Jim Morrison, nine. Kurt Cobain, four Elvis is only got three. So Diane, he needs your help. The King needs a, uh, happened hand. Or maybe another helping. Uh, and you said that, uh, John, I know, would run away with it. Yes, I did. He's not exactly running away with it. He's in the lead. But Jim Morrison's right on his Lily White ass. Here's a call from Weston. Hello. How are you doing, Neil? Pretty good. How are you doing? Well, this kind of just every day I sit in there. It's a here three more serves from Guy, K. I just said yesterday. Yes, they did. That's right. Is there a website that tells you exactly how many, you know, what's the, what's the death counter or, or whatever, you know, how much is, you know, how many people how many, everything that died since, uh, this whole Fiat's go? Uh, I don't really know if there is one. I just don't know what to do. Yeah, they try to find one, but I couldn't. They're going to say something about those sites that we have linked to have something on the website. The main thing is, you know, just, uh, which we're at about this, I think I can't see how, you know, because I can out, you know, that they say, you know, like when they're, when they're in the original, and they had like the demographic of who, which, which people voted for, which president, you know, but I guess by the way, they think that I can't leave, leave, we have this many people that are blinded by the right, you know, that is, they just voted for, this, and we try to see them on the TV, I'd make sure they make me, you know, it's kind of a shame to be American sometimes.

And he's got the other stream because he's making all this money. If he can do whatever it only wants. Plus he's like a big idol over there. I have no idea why. Because he's like a margin looking guy. He's okay. You know, he's probably knows a bridge. How big are you? He's married to one of the spice girls. That is correct. How come you're so like David Beckham intensive? You got like a blow up dollar home or something. The sports guy. Yeah, you told us you weren't one of those sports nerds now. Sports.

Well, he didn't really mean it, but even see where he was putting it. He covered light my fire. Oh, this got man. What the hell got into him? He must have got like a free meal. I was doing this today. Okay. Let's go. No one reason to pay roll. Now we understand it. Wow, no, no, get sore about it.

So that it wasn't all for nothing. And they showed there was like a tree down somewhere in the city. So what we do, you know? I love that front page of the National Post. That's really a crappy paper, but that was so beautiful. And they got pictures of all of these correspondence with their, with their poncho's on and a whole thing getting blown away almost. Okay, let's see. Now, how come we have additional names on here? I thought he was only going to do it the end of the hour. I think he'd listen. Oh, well, he'd listen. As you can, Eric, we don't want to overwhelm you or burden you because the last thing we've month is to like, sour what has become a decent relationship. You're doing a great job with our bedtime stories as I am, by the way. And George's the last thing he needs is to screw the circle and sour on him again and getting psychotic and the last thing I need is for you to start calling me up here again.

So now he's going the other extreme. I thought I think before you get the second name out of your mouth, he'll have it on there. Already I love Eric. He, he's doing a fine job. I mean, he used to be a real asshole, but then something happened. He got religion. 92 votes John 1137. I told he's went in a way with it. Elvis Presley 21, Jim Morrison 20, Kurt Cobain 12, Frank Sinatra 2 and nobody else has any votes. Oh, my God. Nobody else has any votes. Here's the fact this is dear God. Why is Frank Zappa not on that list? Well, because we haven't gotten there yet. We have suggested it till now. He is now. You know, probably the one bit, Bob won't see more than any of them. But one of the ones that I enjoy playing almost more than anything else. Bobby Brown is Bobby Brown. We also got Bobby Bar. Hey there. People on Bob. So we'll get to that. So Frank Zappa's on list is I won't vote until he's there. What you can vote momentarily because I guarantee you, from a dedicated list, they're recently moved to Memphis. Well, good luck in Memphis. You'll need it. Yeah, that's the way to communicate his ass by the end of the day. Freddie Mercury, Georgia, and I were talking about that before, to show we could have put him on there already, but we figured, we'll give you something to do. If we put him all on there, then we'll tell you people going to do. We'll be sad to sit there and do it. Freddie Mercury. Get him on there. A real queen. Anybody can be like a maple leaf queen, but Freddie was a real. He was like maybe the definitive queen. Maple leaf queen. He was a maple leaf queen. Carl O'Facts is here and says I would have to say my favorite dead musician would be, who drummer Keith Moon? That was my vote. Was it? Yes it was. Speaking of Moon, it just dawned on me. We had that drop in that goes, Get the Hoover out the Moon, mine. Maybe that's why he died. Maybe they stuck the Hoover up his, uh, Beckham shoot. The greatest drummer in history, his manic playing, was the inspiration for animal of the, uh, muppets. Most roach star be, uh, behavior and cliches were drawn from his life. How do you like that? And he died as well. George, whatever that means. Nice one, George. He says you got a nice one. Oh, he's seen it then. Keith's moon. Get him on your right away from the room. He's still dead by the way. Are you sure his, I was, I was, he's still his blind. Mine, mine, and local. This is 40560. 208. Number one, Dammit. Hey there, people on Bobby Brown.

I got a cheerleader here once they help with my face. Well, they're doing all the work. And maybe they're leaving on me. And they got a high end. They're American friends. I can't think I'm too extreme. But I had some flung of a bitch. I'm gonna get like the job that we risk. Get a good, get a good, get a good, get a good. Women's with a ratio. The game creepin' all the cross and they're young. I tell you people I was not ready. I'm like this day by the name of pleasure. She made a little speech then. All she tried to make is say, when she had the ball in her eyes. But she left her bitch back in the silver ball. But now I choose to play. Oh God, I am the American ring. But now I smell like mad at the lead. And I'm a miserable son of a bitch. And I am more or less a little bit. I want the one, the one, the one. So what went out and bought me a leisure suit? I'd single my chains, but I'm still kind of cute. I'd just out through a radio call home. And none of the jobs can even tell I'm a whole lot. It's been me and a friend. So I'd have drifted along as it has now. I can think about an hour on the tower of power. A long as I guess so, it'll go to the tower of power. And the American ring, where the spin you left my butt till it makes me scream. And I'll do anything again again. I'll lay away nights and thank your friend. Oh God, I'm so fantastic. Thanks to Freddy, I'm a sexual stastock. Everybody is far behind. Watch me now. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Watch me now. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Everybody is far behind. 11 or 35, 60, WQM, happy Friday. It's raining cats and dogs here in Toronto. But you know something? No big deal. A little bit of wind, a little bit of breeze. They can nest degrees. Here's a fact. Two votes by the way for a current for a French app already. That gets some votes. And rightfully so, I love French app. This guy says, this is from Jean. So I guess he likes anybody named Jean. Jean Kroupe. Was a much better drummer than you have. I'm a drummer in the club. I'm a drummer in the club. I'm a drummer in the club. I'm a drummer in the club. I'm a drummer in the club. What does that mean? Do you have any idea what you mean? Jean Kroupe. Do we really want to put on Jean Kroupe? Why not? He makes me poop. Jean Kroupe couldn't play the tuba. Okay, put him on a him or go to any votes. You have to be really old. Even a whole Jean Kroupe was. But Jean finishes out his facts very nicely by saying, in peach bush. Nice going, Jean. Can I do the story about the world as old as genitals being found? Yeah. Well, here it is. London. This from Reuters, no less. So it might be true. Scientists have discovered fossils of the world's oldest genitals belonging to 400 million year old insects in ancient rocks in Scotland. I don't know that insects had genitals. Did you? Of course. How else do you think they do it? The penis of the ancient harvestman insects commonly known as the Daddy Long legs. Oh, I know him. Oh, you know who didn't make our pool of dead movie stars? Oh, John Holmes. Somebody had called, but he hung up and he was going to say that. Yeah, how do you know then? Because he told me so and I did not want to know that. Why not? Yeah, to tell me what he did want to know. The penis of the ancient harvestman insects commonly known as Daddy Long legs was two-thirds the length of the body and remarkably similar to the modern day species. New scientists magazine said Wednesday. Did he discover that the world's oldest genitals proves that little has changed over the last 100 million years at least for Daddy Long legs. The magazine said, Jason Dunlop and a team of researchers from Humbled University in Berlin will present their findings at a conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, also uncovered a long egg-laying organ called an over-positive from a female and over-positive. As well as genitals, the fossils of the oldest known Iraq-nid respiratory systems suggesting harvestman's ancestors had long since called over the sea and learned to breathe the magazine said. Harvestmen Iraq-nid is sometimes mistaken for spiders, but they're more closely related to ticks or mites because they don't spin webs. Unlike Moe, absolutely, they don't spin a wicked web. The previous oldest penis, which dated back a hundred million years and was found in Brazil belong to an Oster Cod. I wonder if he had his cod piece on. An early crustacean related to crabs, shrimp and water fleas. Oh, how are they? They were the penis that had crabs when he was the oldest penis on an early crustacean. I'll be damned. Now that dated back a hundred million, this one dates back four hundred million years. I guess they're kind of shoots a hole in a Bible crablo. I remember a thousand years ago. Carbon dating isn't real, it's a satanic plot. Yeah, it's a satanic plot. Okay, are you stupid people out there? Just believe all those getchies, okay, all that nonsense. They religious, blah blah blah, look that good old mumbo jumbo. And I do like chicken gumbo. Oh, speaking of this, speaking of penis, mysville, do the stir about on the ancent of that. Sodomy, shocker at New York High School. Do you see the stir it's on our website? Yeah.

Just so people don't get upset because we've got to get some bad stuff. Do I know him? And the almond brother is of course he's on air, boy he's a rambling gambling man. That's one of my very all time favorite scenes in any movie ever. When father, uh, paranoia is there in the bar, father, married father, maran. No, he's not father, maran. Father, maran was the old guy. Sorry. I can't use them. Father, carous. Yes, because you're not a football player. You can't see word association Alice, carous, Detroit lines. Uh, father, carous.

Uh, John Vaughn, lead Zeppelin drummer. Oh, I think we're just playing the rambling. I got it here somewhere, rambling man. Some work. In fact, that's what we're going to do to kill some good time. We're going to play at least two three songs by each of these names. I could play it on the nose guitar. Can you? Yeah. Down. That wasn't bad, but it's not not in the same league. Well, people probably have more practice on it with a hand opportunity. I can't get my Coleman paper out of it. Do a few times. George is most famous at the moment. It was on that bit. He'll paper a comb. That was bad, fact. Five six seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty. So we got the guy with the eyes is helping us out on a band of pair rescue. Geez.

Yeah. Because he's a poor buffalo more on the lake on terror that way. Right. Once in a while, they'll see it. They'll see the lights. It's got to be just right. I'll stop right on the scene. I'm probably a beautiful up there. I mean, a neighborhood. And we're at just there and stuff. I mean, I haven't been up there in like 12 years. I mean, some of their worst neighborhoods. I would compare to the best neighborhoods down here. I don't think we've had a excellent point. Except the one where I used to live, you don't want to go there. No. I was down in the sea breeze. Who are you? Yep. Everything about the night out there. I think we're going to be right there. I think we're going to be right there. We're going to be right there. We're going to be right there. We're going to be right there. We're going to be right there. We're going to be right there. We're going to be right there. We're going to be right there. We're going to be right there.

Fife's. You a M. Find out the hand. Oh, fuck. One foot in the grave. One foot in the grave. One foot in the grave. One foot in the grave. One foot in the grave. One foot in the grave.

He composing Samian, you know. So I will be with you. Who, baby. One foot in that grave. Someone called Barbara. I've got one foot in the grave. People are surprised that I am still alive. Then die in 95. I don't think I'll sing today. My life is fading far away. Whoa. Made it through the night. This is surprising. Did not think I'd see. That's sunriseing. Not bad for a guy. Who's one foot in the grave. Who, baby. Nelson, middle of the show. Where is Nelson? Is he dead? Barbara West, my lunch. I'll check it out, baby. 1146 at 560. Nobody came here. There's a fact that obviously somebody very angry. Dude, how could you leave out George Harrison with a whole bunch of exclamation points out? Don't look at me. I put him in only air. He hasn't put him on the list yet. They're supposed to get around. He's not a lot of pressure. Okay. But it's good timing because this just hot off the press. McCartney involved in scuffle and London. Is he dead now too? Illusionist David Blaine was not magic for Paul McCartney. The former beetle was involved in a shoving match when a photographer tried to take his picture. Neither the London side of Blaine's latest stunt. I'm official said today. The official McCartney spokesman Jeff Baker said the former beetle fired him. He learned that Baker had informed the photographer that the pop star would be visiting the site on the river. Tams were Blaine is trying to live without food for 44 days while suspended from a crane and a plastic box. And there's actually a photo of David Blaine who's being suspended from a crane and a plastic box. He's a dork. David Blaine? Yeah. Am I supposed to know who that is? This is what he does. What he's doing now? This is what he does. At the time. At the time. At the time. The illusion of the. The biggest of him reinstated in the scrub reports of a fracus is exaggerated. A fracus. There's that fracus. London's Metro Police, however, said they were investigating two counter allegations of common assault following the speutanier Blaine site between a photographer and a group of friends at about 1 a.m. London time today. The police didn't name any of those involved in the incident. Baker issued a statement describing how he McCartney and friends of musician went to see Blaine after the after dining in London central London so-called district on Thursday evening. London lads tipped off the press were watching a man in a sleeping bag at a box that Paul was passing the statement said Paul then continued to joke by telling his maid who's his publishes that he was fired. Paul then got into a car and went to home reports that this was a fracus or fracus or anything other than a group of friends on a night or heavily exaggerated. It reports of his death or premature in Yadiyati. Okay. For a story. Just like Paul McCartney with all to respect. I mean, when you can get one up by Michael Jackson. You know what I'm saying? Uh-huh. You can't be too swift. Sunny bone or somebody says, okay, let me read the complete list as I've got it now. Okay, so for your benefit. And Eric's benefit and all the ships would see who is your all-time favorite dead musician. John Lennon Jim Morrison. That's Jim Morrison. Elvis Presley Kurt Cobain. Bond Scott Franks and after Eddie Cocken Bob Marley Jimmy Hendrix. Frank Zappa Freddie Mercury Keith Moon Jean Cooper. Jean Cooper was always annoying to me. They've stayed him back in the early days of TV or something about the way he looked was just bizarre. Ronnie van Zand George Harrison Dwayne Alman's TV wave on Buddy Holly Ray Orbison Jerry Garcia. John Bonham Glenn Miller. Janice Joplin. Johnny's cash. Randy Rhodes not the broadcast to a girl better shape. She's still alive. Marvin Gaye. See that cruise? Very white. Two pack. Jim Crochet and Sunny Bonham. What a list, huh? What a magnificent list and we got a long way to go. Lots more names on his list. Not third man. But so far, John Lennon. He's like he's pulled away from the package like Secretary in the Belmont 1973. Pulled away from the pack left him in the lurch. Here's a call from Margie. Hello. Good morning. Yes sir. How you doing? Good man, you're tough. Okay. Good how about Warren's divoture list? Okay. And just recent two is a matter of fact. How soon they forget? Yeah, no kidding. Just days ago.

How about patchy climb? Patchy climb is magnificent. Good. Thank you very much. And have a great day. Thanks. Bye. Patchy climb. Every time we do one of these about the hello. We haven't. I don't think we did this exact one. But regardless, patchy climb deserves a mention. What's the what the hell is the song I'm trying to think of? Crazy. Patchy climb. No, not crazy. Every mid night. Never that? Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Even though come to music does suck largely. How about Marty Robbins? A white sport coat and a pink carnation. Well, when I was a kid, I was on Columbia Records. I had that. I love that song. Sure, because it's a pink carnation. Yeah, I like pink. That was the first inkling. The first pinkling that I had to be a fake. I'm putting Marty Robbins under. I'm, you know, it's my show. I'll put whoever to hell I want. Marty Robbins. Look at the motor, too. On how nine.

Next time, do find out what would happen if Nancy Reagan lost weight? Let's bulletin, just in. It appears that the first lady has disappeared. We're next. We ask. What? Here. Okay, just for my homework and future reference, give me the, uh, this can the number of the cut. 649. This is 6 number for I never would have found it. Nice work, George. And by the way, we're number one and we want to pat everybody on the back connector with a show of suffer Scott because he hasn't been there long enough. Now, we don't want to pat you on the back. You haven't done start taking credit. Although Scott for rail, the real Scott, he did great. We had about an 8.5 and Mo had a point one as we were figuring out. What do you think? What's the point, Mo? And nobody wants your crappy keychain either. It's pretty depressing. We've got to get busy on that Scott for a while. You know, remember start raising some cash. Well, we talked about that. What do you mean we talked about having a hope of making back the money that we spent making these other ones? We better wait until we sell some of them before we start making new alternative products. If you know it all. Yeah. You know the word. Besides, let's save us something to do next year, hang. Yeah, but then we're not going to raise anybody this year. We have a bunch of little dogs and putty cats that are going to like go, uh, why? What? We'll get a one in the end. We'll get a one in the end by the end of the year. We will. Yeah. Based on what? Based on it's, it always happens. This is the slowest, the creepiest, the, uh, most depressing fundraiser I've been involved in. And then the Senate Joe and Mark with their limited audience to begin with. Out in the middle of the guy in Everglades in some kind of a paddle boat. I mean, what is that? Embarrassing. Kind of a freaking fundraiser. Is that, huh? Here's a call from a moral gevel. So it's okay. Okay. How about about a half an hour? Chalpe the dance warning. He, he, he was on his way these this morning. Here's North Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Mozart. Old Clark. Hey. Oh, I think it's time for you to depart. That was a work of art. 5 6705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Well, let's get the Brahms and Beethoven list. Chopper. Franz List. 1156 4 minutes. I'm, uh, till noon. See if I was real quick. It's almost not worth it. You understand, but it's time to get through this. Where? It's really not worth it. Hey, I'll tell you where a thickener is either in 4 Laterdale now. And a lot of Rochesterians used to love thickeners. They love that in Bob's too, but they're out of business. And a thickener was resledging to you as well because they had great fresh fruit. They had that delicious, uh, special hot sauce. And it had the Rochester White hot and thickeners is in south Florida now. They're unfetterable highway just out the barbola and the tunnel on the east side. Thick and earth is like a flashback in time to what really great restaurants used to be before all the fast food crap. Go into thickeners and enjoy a burger or hot dog serve fresh hot and fast. Thick and earth is brought to for Laterdale by the same guys who feed you. Cheyberg or cheaper. They use the same great fresh 100% ground shock meat as cheaper. Cheyberg and off are you an incredible big fat one, a quarter pound hot dog. What makes thickeners different from anybody else in town? I'll tell you right now like I said early moments ago. Their burgers and dogs are served with a signature meat sauce poured on top. Giving you an amazing combination of flavors that do like a little tap dance in your push. So if you're looking for something else to try, thickeners is about all kinds of great dishes including a great breakfast menu. Amlets cook to order French toast pancakes, all your favorite side dishes. So stop by thickeners even for if you're from like Buffalo. We'll still let you in and see what all the talk is about thickeners on federal highway. Just south of Barbarne and the tunnel on the east side and for Laterdale. Be sure and tell them that old Rochester Mavin, the O'Rodger sent to buy to Vic and Irves. I'm in love with this poor twinny o' likesy. You way am. This mark, Morgan, is the 12 to one hour on Q8.

Is the half game it's in the lost column fillies of lost one more game? Yeah, the Marlins have one extra game. So right that's right fillies have one fewer game and again that they have played they lost it So they have the game in hand, so they would like to win out Which is unlikely but if they were to win or last nine or whatever they got left then they either win They pretty much had their playoff destiny in their hands before they started with the Philly's but they got the whole thing in their hands What about little Lori London you think he's dead probably and but he's got the whole world in his hands.

No, no, don't want you to play it. Yasha Highfits, the greatest violinist of all time. Right. Yasha Highfits. Are you crazy? I don't think we're putting Yasha on there, but Rick Nelson definitely. John Leonard is the one in the pony race. He's got 90. You're all time favorite dead musician. But, then it's pretty interesting. Elvis Presley, 40, Jim Morrison, 39 is Jim Morrison continues right in the king's ass. Bob Marley, 23, Jimi Henry's 22, kind of hard to separate those two. Maybe buy a hair. Kurt Cobain, 22, he's time with Jimi Henry. They're in a dead flat footed tie. Frank's an opera 18, Freddie Mercury 15, Stevie, we were all on 50. Say, yeah, Chris 13. Pucci Cucci. Yeah. Look at that Cucci. Frank's, yeah. You do it. Frank's happened 12. You're a Garcia. Right back. Roy Orbison's seven. He started to move up a little bit after we played that crap.

Now let's see, is there anybody with no votes? Oh yeah. Jan is drop on still even after you played that bit. In fact, that probably since did. She ain't got squashed. She belongs to that other pole we're going to do. Which musician are you glad is dead? Oh. Do I not like that? Do I not have none? Sunny Bono, Warren Zivan, Harry Chaper and Sid Vicious out of 379 votes. They all got the big zero. Now, speaking of a big zero, Barry Jackass. In the hero this morning in his column called In my opinion, Met's show interest in Shambi for radio. Makes me want to play. That. Let's make one play that book for me. Or beer. Like any like, like, no, like, no. Like, not, like, no. Like, don't, be like, no. Like, don't, be like, no. Anyway, my video announced her book, Shambi who's developed developed into a top-tallot as emerged as a strong candidate for radio-java-the-Oork-Mets. And the Marlins should try to keep in by offering him more than three-innings per game he does now. Because of the lure of broadcasting in this hometown of New York, only an off-rooted de Marlins' lead radio announcer would probably make Shambhi think twice about accepting an offer from the Mets should one be if-stended, and even that might not be enough. Shambhi isn't commenting on the issue, but he's a known commodity among the decision-makers that New York's fan WFAN, which is seeking replacement for retiring legend Bob Murphy. It's a Lion Dry-Yob. Bob Murphy? No, a Lion Dry-Yob. No, awful, just terrible. Gary Cohn Murphy's current partner, likely would assume the lead role on the broadcast. Although Dave Anhorn has had a distinguished career in his classic baseball voice, he makes more mistakes than Shambhi. Among other things, Van Horns' season is identified at Ground Ball as a pop-up, and at Ground Ball as a homer, although he was quick to write correct himself. Van Horns is still functional, but the Shambhi Van Horns, that's like somebody who's hooked up to like a life support, they're still functional. Yeah, like Moe. But the Shambhi Van Horns' team has not achieved the committed chemistry anywhere near the level of the Jo Angel David O'Brien tandem in the Marlins' infancy. The reason isn't surprising, Van Horns' style is old school, and Shambhi comes from the new generation baseball analysis, Shambhi isn't going to make a pop culture reference that my flyer Van Horns head. Was he talking about that bad piece? Who would that's a shot? Because the rumor I'm here, and I haven't met Dave Anhorn, who's got a worse hair piece than Moe. Hup in that beat. Now, wait till you're at this. A very jackass taken a really good dig. Nice God, Barry, you little pansy. With two years left at his contract, Van Horns figures to return, even though his vanilla delivery in overrelines on statistics hasn't exactly energized the audience. Oh, what a line. Ha ha. Even though it's coming from the barely functional Barry Jackass. With two years left on his contract, Van Horns figures to return, even though his vanilla delivery, it's up and away. And overrelines on statistics hasn't exactly energized the audience. Understand it at the century. It's about time somebody wrote Rippinette Dave Anhorn. And as he is terminal man, the exciting year, the Marlins of Had. He's about as exciting as a frog's fart. Nothing. Zero. He's a kind of guy that when he has an orgasm, it's kind of like like that. That's it. It's more like that. Here's Miami Beach, hello. Marie Skip. Morris Skip, excellent. Thank you. So how could we forget? Although I understand he's got a very hot wife. That Morris Skip, Dave Anhorn. That's all anybody talks about when you mention his name. We've got a hot wife at a vanherpie's worth and more. And he's got a vanilla delivering and he ought to go up and away. And look, this is 42560. And number one, damn it. Oh, Chris, this little fatter around. Even groupies are turning us down. It's no hard to keep a hip-stown. Get me my wheelchair. Wish my face was a rearrangeable. It's kind of wrinkly and unsreatenable. Brother, did I start to blow up old? Get me my wheelchair. Wish my face was a rearrangeable. It's no more. It's no more. It's no more. It's no more. I hate the night. I hate the pain. To leave you. I'll wrap my dancers and then pull the song. Then you're crazy. Oh, boy. You still look sharp when we were last. But if you think that we look really bad, check keep the wintry style tattoo instead. Get me my wheelchair. Wish my face was a rearrangeable. I cut myself good next to Bob Dylan. Now that we're made and killing, get me my wheelchair. Oh, getting my wheelchair. Wish my wheelchair. I hate the night. Wish my face was a rearrangeable. I believe I found it. Best of 92. I'm a good step on his matter. For example, I think I probably already have to stuck this in there. For example. It's like that. Here is what what's Palm Beach hello. Yeah sir. Just reading the time as you in and having a journey to Wight out here and I heard on Sign. It was the 60 chicks played without a glass. Scoutlet. I can be looking on the internet for it. I'm looking at CNN nothing yet. Guys, guys, guys, you were saying that was a European version of like Fox or something, is that right or wrong? Yeah. Then have a website? Sure they do. Well, George, George, you get busy. You know, again, well, George doesn't have to do. I can do it right now. I got my computer is a closer than his is. Thank you. Because what I want to use, I turned to the Real Roger show. There you go. Okay, Pally. Thanks. Do you believe that? I think that was useful. Sky News topic. Here it is. It's not coming up too quick, but here it is. Sky News. Let's go. Liberal Democrats take Brent East Sea. Rap Councilor, Attack Women. You got it? Nothing you're about to dig sea chicks. That was just a whole week. A whole act. It was a whole acts. But anyway, right, there's Sky News. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T for Rizewireless Land. Speaking of news, White House titled over Kennedy Bookflapp. Maybe Catherine Harris was on that plane. What do you think? The White House is keeping an arms like the controversial new book alleging that former President Lyndon Johnson had a hand in the 1963 slang of his predecessor, John have Kennedy. Remember I talked about this book? Yes, you did. The twist, blood money and power, how LBJ kills JFK is by Barma Kloen, White House spokesman Scott McClullin's father. Are you ready for that? The younger McClullin recently brushed his side effort to get him to come in on the text, Dryly Teller reporter. Thank you for the opportunity, but I'm not going to have any comment on it. Scott McClullin 35 is not the only big player in US politics. His brother Mark 40 heads the FDA. Even if for this, his brother Mark heads the FDA his mother, Carol Keaton's Strayhorn 63, is contraught in Texas President Bush's home state. Barma Kloen divorced from a state horn years ago, a person to make a splash when his bookhead stores in September 30. In it he would allegedly report that he reportedly alleges that Johnson's personal lawyer organized Kennedy's killing in Dallas after the young president plan to pick a different running mate in the 64 elections. How do you like that? Wow. So I'll put that over in my pile of things to I haven't even bought the what you call a bookhead. Al Franken? The Elsa Franken book. So many books to buy and so little time. And of course so many trips to the Delhi then and so many candidates. You know? I know if I were going to run for president for the highest office in the world actually. I'd probably hit for the Delhi then, have me's a good play to kishki with some nice gravy on it. Then I'd get over the dickers for a couple of watches to white hats. About a pound of the half of that hot sauce on it. Get my kishki's really turned in real good. Wesley Clark, let me say it again. Comparison self that you would leave a minute to Connecticut regarding it was you on a war of the Iraq attack. Not to enthusiastic about this, Wesley Clark thing. I like a lot of you bandbag and jumpers out there. See, a lot of people are saying, oh well, he's the one that can win. Well, how do you know that? Based on what? Hight and a war hero and all of that. Lucy's got the little rock Arkansas mafia behind him. That's it. I like Howard Dean myself. Okay. I'm a big fan of the Dean. That's the presentation. Hello. Yes sir. Hey, what's up buddy? Hey, don't. They just flashed a thing. The dicksy chicks just flashed on MSNBC. Did it really? Yeah. And it said a plane, the plane they were carrying. They were in hit a building while taxiing. So, they probably clipped a thing or a stairway or something. The plane didn't go down. Still way to heaven? Yeah, that beauty it said the plane went down and got. People don't know how to read. Well, that they get, you know, one or two words, you know, and all of a sudden, but I beat, but I've opened all of a sudden before you know what the sky is falling. Unbelievable. It's like it's just like the hurricane Isabella supposed to be Terrence Radoa part is just to not even rain in right now. All we had to do is read the whole goddamn sentence. Right. All right, George is a miserable asshole. Okay. Thanks, Mark. Uh, let's see, passenger and custody after rushing cockpit door. There's not a word about the Dixie church on the CNN website. And I'm going to MSNBC right now. Here's the guy wiping his ass on some spot. Oh, God. Uh, a man is in federal custody. Uh, this is yesterday. A man was in federal custody yesterday after he tried to break into an airplane cockpit during a flight from South Africa to Atlanta. The FBI said, how do you like that? How come this happening yesterday? And now we're just, it just making the rounds. Hmm. Have you heard about this? Oh, uh, just popped up on CNN federal agents to James Drake. 53 in the custody yesterday morning after South African Airlines flight 77.99. Atlanta, Atlanta's Hart's given an actual airport. The planes crew told authorities, Drake tried to rush the cockpit door to about 6 AM. Some two and a half hours before to plane the schedule land in Atlanta. He was scheduled by passengers and Epis. He was some dude by two past years. A deputy sheriff and a psychiatrist. The FBI said, always been to have a shrink on board. The FBI said the incident was not an attempted terrorist act. Drake as he was citizen. But his hometown was not immediately known. Immediately known. This is yesterday morning. Drake faces federal charges that include interference with a flight crew member. He was arrested in 1987 after a similar incident. I had domestic airline flight. He didn't stand trial in that case. So I was probably a good idea for not to stand trial. So we could do it again. No one sounds like to me. He maybe he's kind of that guy that calls us. I'm crazy. That guy. Oh, yeah. Let's have a big family. No doubt. Oh, no doubt was on the plane. Here's Carl Spray. Hello. Yes, sir. Speaking of Led Zeppelin, you stay with him. I like to nominate John Barnum. I don't know if he's been on in that. He's already on. He's not doing too great. But he's on there. He's not committed to things that he played a lot better when after he died than when he was alive. I believe that. Yes, that's very documented. He was a lot better drummer. Well, he's there. He's got five votes. He's there with Marvade. He's not a good guy. He was dead in alive. Right. Say it one more time. Say it again. I said he could. OK. 560, 560. He's still saying it. Here's the call from Carl Spray. Hello. I know how are you today. Pretty damn good. Good. I think I have a good one that a dead artist that might climb right up your pole. I think he was climb up my pole, huh? Well, you know, I'll go to speak on the boat. I'll do a little rendition for you. OK. Everybody loves somebody. Come on. I'm ready. Everybody knows if he could go. He's home. Have a great weekend. OK. Thank you, too. Dean Martin, what do you say? He likes it. I put him on. It couldn't sing for a Schmidt man. He was a great artist. But he had a common with his good lifelong buddy. Yes, and after they couldn't sing for a Schmidt. Although Dean had a better contract. 560, 50560, I mean, a Frank did. Had a better contract. Look at this. We may find out about the recall today. The voting system is predicting that the punch card is going to make a comeback. 85 year old Bill Rooferall designed the original system. Wait back in the 60s. He remains its biggest fan.

Yeah. Because coming to find out that they knew what they were talking about. Well, we never said that he was, you know, involved with 9 11. We were working on that idea. Destructioner that he was connected with Al Qaeda or Osama Yamama or any of those things. We just thought it might be a good time to go in there and create a real mess. An expensive one. Oh, a real expensive mess, right? And get some cheap gas. I'll let them work out to me. Remember though. Now the fact is we're having a supply gas for that. That's about the other day. Yeah. Last night we want to congratulate Dan. We're out there in John Roberts and the people at CBS News. Who did a fantastic at about 6 45 last night Eastern time. I shot boys. Fantastic job on who's uh, who's telling the truth and who's uh, what's this all about? And are they doing like a baton switch on us here? Oh my god. Yeah, who'd are they you guys can without your bull crap lies on when is the impeachment start? I mean, stop and think about it. Here we got all these lives being lost every day. Billions and billions and billions of tax dollars being spent. That could be spent to provide people with health care on people with an education. That could be used for real, online securities. So we didn't have to be crap in our pants 24 hours a day. But no couple of blow jobs. We got an impeachment thanks to Kenny Stern about your rabbit right when lunatics.

And thank you very much for registered. And here we go. Thanks. Tommy Bowling, there's somebody we never heard of, but I don't know. That's my birthday. I never heard of Sharp Guy. Sounds pretty sharp to me. He knows what side is up on which side is down. How are you replacing his dirt in the ground? You know, carrots, you might want to reconsider your decision. Okay. About this Scott character that we found under a dumpster. Oh, anyway, but what did he just say before that? They were so they were important. Yeah, you're absolutely correct, sir. The American finally, the media are starting to like open up the closet door a little bit. And they're not lucky. Lucky, lucky quite so much as they were before. It's becoming politically fashionable now to tell the public the truth, which I really know is as very revolutionary in America. But slowly, but surely, and that's why you see those pull numbers dropping like a rock, dropping rapidly. Now let's see, oh, to market sound a little bit today, they're unable to continue with this very bizarre, you know, this sudden surge we've seen on the down the NASDAQ. They were celebrating because they got rid of that chairman. Oh, Dick Grasso. Yeah, would nice I hear cut. Oh, like I said yesterday, boy, did they before Wednesday the people on CNN Maria Bacteroma and all those good buddies and both G, but didn't really do anything wrong. And did they agree to give them that money and his name? You know, you know, he looked like crap in all over because he's buddy buddies. One of their asshole buddies there on a gambling channel. All these hundred and forty million dollars for a bald hit a geek like him. His biggest biggest thing he had to do every day was to ring that damn bell, right? If I had a hammer, smacking right on the head with a piece of crap, Dick Grasso, what a dick. Here's the call from beautiful Stuart, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How about the temptation?

How do you like that? David Eli Ruffin. Did. June 1st, 1991, one of the most recognizable localists who averaged from Motown. He was the younger, no. Younger brother of Jimmy Ruffin and a cousin of Melvin Franklin of the temptations. Maybe Jimmy Ruffin wasn't the temptation's either. He was just kind of Ruffin it. Let's see. Does it have the circumstances of his death here? Uh... No, no, no, no. Oh, it's still going on and on. How about you? It's got the whole detail here. A few weeks after his last performance, David Ruffin died in tragic circumstances, following an overdose of crack cocaine. How do you like that? Oh, my God. Those tragic circumstances. Just like Marvin Gaye and a little crack cocaine, and that he said, what do you do? You be dead. Well, how do you like that? Why not take a listen to walk away from love, taking from the album of who am I? Or take a listen to everything coming up low, or always right on this website. A memoir, David Ruffin, my temptation. What was that touching? I'm touching. But he had like a little most problem. And then he died. Damn it. So let's put David Ruffin on there. What do you say? How do I? David Ruffin. That was a great song. What becomes of the broken hearted? I was still alive or dead. You know, has on the book from Rochester and then Buffalo Steve Alaymo. What was his song? His big hit?

I cloud has been hovering around darkness is setting now on back. But again, a very large explosion. It was definitely felt a few kilometers away. In other words, they haven't got any idea. They're just vamping now because they don't have any idea what it was. It was very large and it was very colorful and it was Yati Aania. Nothing about the Ditchie Tix yet. But hey, Goldberg said. Yes. No. He said Steve Olimo is alive and well and runs away. Oh right. He's down here and he sees him at the track all the time. I'll be damned. I wonder if he knows Steve Lawrence's brother. I don't know. Hank knows Steve Lawrence's brother. He was the elevator operator for 100 years at Gulf Stream and Calder. Hank knows who I'm talking about. Okay. He has it. Is he in there? He's building. The Clarets came in here to tell me that. He must be in the building. Well, if he's in. Hey, hey, come on in here. I don't know where he is. If he's in a building somewhere around.

He apparently sent a letter a few weeks back to Kobe Bryant offering to take care of the problem, meaning to kill the young women who claims that Kobe Bryant sexually called the her. Bryant's people then contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the sting operation went underway, which was video and audio tape. And as I said, it all began with that letter. The letter was the trigger point that the real part of the investigations were our undercover investigators, and the investigators contacted him directly and firstly, and that with him on three occasions, this started on September.
