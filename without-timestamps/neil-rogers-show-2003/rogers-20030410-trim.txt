Nerf, I'm going to get a scum like that girl! Godwild is the video that shows real girls splashing their goods join Spring Break Week in Florida! What about the hoties? Who spent the whole year in Florida? Now, thank God they're own video! It's Golden Girls Godwild! Who's in Hawaii? It's all your favorite Golden Girls! Dorothy Rose Blanch and they always seductive Sophia! I share it to think what was going on throughout the world! Well, you won't have to think because Golden Girls Godwild is two full hours of these ravenous retirees, showing loads of wrinkly scams! I am the most attractive and available woman in all of my amnes! Golden Girls Godwild! These hoties with hot flashes are going tough, let's ever chance they can! Except when they're arthritis players. Girl, I'm never even open my eyes again! It doesn't get any sexier than this! But they'll take our word for it! Listen to what they call in girls are saying about each other! She was fucking forgotten! It's Golden Girls Godwild! Watch it just one time and you'll agree! I know two of five, 60 of WQM happy Thursday to be able to and I had some very warm bonding moments this morning, even a little beiner boy couldn't believe it. Touching. Especially when I put on those two muskgrat rugs and walked in there kind of waddled in there. Zack, try to compose yourself! Wait, that's if it would lose you job, Zack! Be laughing at the boss in there! Man, he was just a turlyse at almaschman as pants! He was laughing so hard! I thought it was lovely! And then more open drawer here a little bit later on and yelled in, but he said something about real... He said, I was pretty good, he said, but you can't put real hair on a fake head. Have you ever seen a mannequin with a wig gone? See what mode should I understand? He's not what can you put real hair on a fake head? You can put fake hair on a real head! If anybody should know, you know what I'm saying? I didn't think so, he's slow on the uptake. So anyway, the exciting news, the new development on MSNBC, new development! Was they tore down another statue of Sodom and Kyrh Cook? And they had the Sod effect of hitting the ground in Kyrh Cook. So that's the big thing now, is a statue is being yanked down by the Iraqi people. This is tremendous penetrating work there for the networks. New development! Here's our first pass that they already. Before we give the pull resup, you get out of where new pull and get onto a wild, fast four hours. Says good morning, Neil. It's official. I'm not finished with listening the Howard David show. Sorry to Goldie, good luck in getting out of there he says. Goldie was kind of like, you know, he did chuckle a little bit, he tried to control him softly. He was tortlling. Sorry, Goldie to put you in that position. Howard David is such an egotistical pompous asset, says he doesn't know Schmidt from Apple butter when it comes to sports. He is a broadcaster who should be doing the trampoline weather and set a sports. This morning, I just about drove off the road about 705 on Howard blurted out. The islanders were the shocker of night along with the flyers beating the leaf. He's a dumbass, it says. What are you chuckling about? Says he's a dumbass. He didn't really say that about the, I don't know, it says I hope you can get to tape. It says if I heard it wrong, which is possible, then my apology to mold, but I don't think I misunderstood. In addition to which, I think you get a little bit carried away because quite frankly, the final score that game has no bearing on the way the game itself. It was a grotesque performance. It says he went upon gold leaves, but I'm going to tell you something that was, I mean, the win a game like that still had me just puking. I was done on a floor puking my guts out at the end of the game. I've never seen a worse performance than the second period. I mean, just just absolutely hanging on for a dear life. Final score, Philadelphia 3, Toronto 5, we'll take it. Andrew Pop gets injured. Darcy Tucker gets injured, no loss there. But the same old stuff again, playhouse, lots of injuries, lots of embarrassment, but still come out with a win. Nice, go on boys. Also, it says in his facts to get that my mind off is incident and an honor of golf, we could QM, could you play throughout your show, the drop of tiger woods, I like him, what's your agenda? I draw with the origin, is you were telling it from some dumb movie? Yes, from shaft. From Shansh, not our bit. It's a mobit. We don't play most drop-ins on this show. We got nothing more on drop-ins. Okay. So, sorry about that. I'm sorry that Moa, his knowledge of hockey came bursting through again. One of those things. A lot of hockey knowledge on this radio station. Speaking of the Augusta thing, I'm not going to spend any time with him. I'm tired of that. It's just ponderous. You know, we did have the Stanley Cup playhouse series there last night, and all the way to work, the only thing I heard on a Moa show, was about the bad limitations of Hoody Johnson. Talk about a drooling Yahoo Redneck. I mean, good. I say to be redundant. A drooling Yahoo Redneck. Just pathetic. And you'll notice how they've kind of changed their tune on this station a little bit. All these misogynists guys we got on here. Wow, you know, we don't agree with what he's doing, but that's his right. He can do whatever he wants. And then, to my amazement, which I was unaware of, because I don't want to give her crap about golf, come to find out that Jews are still excluded from membership at Augusta. Jews. And don't we have three, at least three, maybe four Jews on this station. And then all along this last year defending. I mean, yeah, he can leave anybody out out. He wants, but CBS in a meantime is making it into a major spectacle and promoting it. That's the problem. Right. Not a question of whether he has a right to do it as a private club or not. And once upon a time, of course, before the elder came along, they excluded blacks as well. So obviously, the blacks had a much better and more threatening lobby than the Jews and the women. Of course, we should know that here. That's where it goes. It's a Schwarz-Velth. But the fact that they don't let Jews in there, and they've been on there hysterically, and it's easy to do that. So I support the attack on Iraq. It's the same thing. Look at the pole. Stick your finger off the window. See which way to win this blowing. And then say, oh, yeah, these damn dikes. This marked up Burke and all these. Yeah, they're painting the ass. You didn't hear that quality. They had saying that, uh, always tradition is never seen. Oh, no, I wrote it down. No, you got it wrong. Not just tradition. Augusta, the guy was up there five times. Then, what one on the safe? I've been there 11 times broadcasting an tournament. That tournament. He said it was hallowed ground. I wrote it down, actually. See, I mean, what's that remind? No, hallowed ground. You want that reminded me of? It reminded me of the day that Mad Dog got that call after the hurricanes. When a big game over, was it FSU? Was that the game? And then the dolphins pulled out that big game the next day. Right. The caller who said, aren't we blessed down here, Jim? And then, of course, very soon afterward, the hurricanes lost the national championship and the dolphins took him gagged into England for a few minutes. Aren't we cursed down here, Jim? I mean, seriously, the people that the sports nerds attract at this radio station, they're scary. I mean, we got some scary people, but you know, something even the scariest of our scary people. You know, even a worst of our chronics. You know what I mean? Yeah, like that. Even the worst aren't in the same category with these sports nerds. They scare me. It's hallowed ground. No changes. There can be any changes up there because it's your right. It's tradition. They've been doing this for as in years. Some of you argue black folks out there that are back and pick cotton on a plantation. They did that for odd redeers too and more. I mean, what does that mean? It's tradition. Figuratory has always been tradition. And when somebody comes along, he's got the balls to say, hey, this is bull crap. So I would think that the Jews on this radio station who should be saying, that it's a bigoted nasty. It reminds me of the old KELWorth Hotel on Miami Beach on by Arthur Godfrey. At least he was part owner, something like that. And they excluded. It was one of the course of those times in the 50s. It was commonplace restricted. No Jews, no blacks, no a, only good old, the glam. No Jews, no black folks, dogs. Right, no spicks. You're out. Yeah. And so the Jews on Miami Beach on a commission actually doing always the right thing. They were border Arthur Godfrey for his bigotry by renaming 41st street Arthur Godfrey Road. And to this day, I still can't figure that out. One of the most notorious anti-Semites never ever hired a Jew to be on his show ever. And yet it's the same thing. So why would you want to promote something that smells, I mean, it's the stench of bigotry exclusion just in river rail. And if you never, if you just saw this drooling red neck on your yesterday, I'd never seen him before, just still pictures. I haven't seen him. Oh, oh my god. He makes Trent lot. He makes, I'm trying, he makes less dramatic seem like Ted Kennedy. I'm telling you. Drulling Yahoo would ahead the accent, you know, just a real, like, Phil Graham from Texas, you know, remember him? That Drulling Yahoo Redneck. We're not too crazy about Drulling Yahoo Redneck on this program. I just want to mention it right up front. So if you're a Drulling Yahoo Redneck, don't take it personal as you want to, you know? I mean, just, I don't know. I mean, you're entitled to be a Drulling Yahoo Redneck, but just don't mess with anybody. Just stay there, hold yourself. Stick around with a lot of other Drulling, you know, re-ahu Redneck. I'm telling you, that's what I do it. No Jews, and I'll gust up. And he just mentioned that, Moe in passing, just in passing, that he couldn't be made to actually say Jew because they wouldn't be. He couldn't be a member in Goldie, he couldn't be a member in Robert Creeper, so when we're out there, by the way, thanks to the California Pizza Kitchen, and I only had a salad, don't get panicky. That was a great salad with blue cheese and little strips of onion ring and chunks of real bacon. Man, that was good. They brought by tons of pizzas, and gets it with the first one out there in a hallway to observe it. Zack. Hey Zack. Whoop. You're not full, anybody? You cow. I told him that. I said, why are you out here? Oh, just organize your... Oh, he's got the car packed with the, with the leftover, though. I already, I guarantee he's packing it. Quit packing it, Zack. You're going to die. I'm telling you, right now, you're going to die. He's packing it. You know something that seemed from Fatsau, where he ate all the Chinese food in the car in the way home? That's what's going to happen. There will not be, there won't be a piece of crust from those 25 pizza boxes that's actually got in the car by the time he gets home. To his eating joint. I feel so bad for the fat people around here. You know, the size's durian, by the way, speaking of fat people, she brought, I got ranger, you know what? She's fat. I mean, not real tubby fat. I got a lot, you know. I got this with this. It's felt here. In this place. No, she's fat. But anyway, she still hates mole like poison. This in case you're on a way home to Volca, Durian still hates you like crazy. And she said, the only reason you were speaking where this morning is because you had to come out there to get to free food. That's what Durian said. You tub a crap mole. And by the way, that thing was moving on his head this morning. I wish we had photos. We put it on our website of the tremendous performance I put out in there. It was great. It was sensational. Everybody was peeing in their pants. Even Galdi was like squirming around because he didn't want to like just totally crack up and lose his job. I think the audience probably thinks that you're kidding. That you would not be joking. I'm not joking. I'm not joking. It's a we have. I don't know where they came from. But we have some pelts, dead. What are those? Racoon. Minks. Oh. If he didn't know I'd been wearing a mink stool, he'd have really impressed. Maybe that's why I tried to stick his tongue to my throat. But so I went in and I just flopped it over the top of my head. Then there was an end of course I looked in there and he like as eyes were rolling around like a pinball machine. And then I came back and we got to one where the mink is like like a raccoon cap. It's like when the head looking at you. But totally turned around like a lucky arm. I almost. And I popped that on there. And of course at that point, exactly. I dropped the load in his pants. And mole actually said, nice job. Nice job. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. What's better in mind? Something like that. It's done by the way, it does look a lot better in yours. How can you leave the house in the morning? Looking like that mole. Everybody's laughing. Oh my god. There's a 70 year old man with a 200 year old way. It's nasty. Anyway, let's do this spot. I see how I'm rounding again. Anyone in the lie has cus Georgia's in here to interrupt me. Kind of so glad he's not here this week. 12 minutes after nine and five sixty wqm.

That's their ear right there minks Always wanted that was my life's a goal I guess I've reached it to where mink This is bad news for by the way Dr. Ackens Dr. Bob my good close personal friend the thought of the Ackens diet No, not quite but low carbohydrate diet promoter Dr. Robert Ackens was hospitalized yesterday with severe head injuries after falling on icy sidewalk in New York Atkins 72 slipped and fell Tuesday outside the atkins Center for complimentary medicine according to Richard Rothstein a spokesman for Ackens and by the way Neither one of them could be admitted to August either Although he was admitted to West New York while court court now medical center Where they do allowed you's were he under one surgery for severe head trauma. He fell on the ice That was gonna be a health thing Skeptic what don't you start with your you know, he just is a guy that weighs about 42 pounds soaking wet in the sink And you're gonna start in about to die it's by the way do you some of that pizza? Yeah, that's high one is great good there you go. Thanks again to California pizza kitchen Don't do it again while I'm here though, please Now that you saw what I eat at the salad too much of it though was a gigantic but it was all atkins okay I got a lot in slip on a pavement just like in the answer to them Rothstein said the extent of Ackens impermanence as yet unknown he's in recovery now and doctors are telling us it'll be a day or two or three days before we have the answers to these questions Atkins is the author of the best selling Dr. Ackens new diet revolution which emphasizes meat eggs Teas and discourages bro, I know all about that. We know the Ackens on his show. Okay. We don't need any primers on the That stuff okay for experts. I know we just can't do it. I mean So there you go. Let's pray for Dr. Bob. What do you say? Let's pray a little bit. I'm a ruchato tonight Saviour doc Here's the pool from yesterday by the way save muff to why I'd say prayer for me. Not feeling to good day He said something about the little head Cool Here's yesterday's facts Which of these sends you diving to the dial to change stations a foul. Let's before we do the pull resale. We'll get a jewellery port from Augusta WQAM I was listening to what in the other four. Yes, sir. I think I made a mistake regarding the gestinational policy on on Jews. Is it not true? Last year's Sandy Wilde is chairman of the city group resigned his membership over the Over the mark the percussion and so if he was on a board then he must have been they must have changed that He's very well. That's another mistake on a mo show then Okay, thanks for the good news. See another mistake for a mo another bad mistake. No, yeah Not only he said the flyers beat the leaves last night. That really hurts boy After we played a crap game like that and still won five to three. Let's hear for Alexander McGilley Trick baby, man. He is so good. God is he great. I'm not just talking about a great hockey player just a great athlete. I'm at any sport Remember that you reskoreed 76 schools with buffalo years ago. No, I know you wouldn't Long time ago, but he just underrated. He'll give the credit he deserves Alexander McGilley is God, baby. Nice gone sweet art Pretty upset about that injury to Nick Antropov not good, but I just mentioned that in passing any hockey interest out there. I know it So we made a mistake on that and he makes a mistake. I mean, this is a major thing That sounds actionable to me, you know Land when a guy comes on our air and says that Augusta would not allow him or creeper I'll unless there was something else about and I even ask creeper to make sure Because he said that he and creeper and Goli couldn't be members of Augusta. That's I will maybe just creeps They don't well it in right now. It could be it so I asked rock so let's blame it on a mo and I'm creeper because I asked that professional self-hating you in a hall by the food there I said is that we need true because I want to get my fat straight And this first caught our right off right off the bat. Close that out of the water Get your facts right mo use silly old goose my god The same man that tells us that you can't put real hair on our fake head. I guess he's never seen a mannequin Gar from New York. He should have walked by macy's window many times Huh, looked in and just wished that he could look like one of those mannequins I'm not talking about the ones that have like a real face just around ones that have no features, you know You know the ones I'm talking about it's just like the the piece on top of the head Sure you can you can put real hair on a fake head and fake hair on any real head Or you can also put fake hair on a fake head. It's mixing match mo you'd make your pick He was wearing his Thursday finest today. By the way, the one it's pused gray. It was beautiful It didn't move around a little bit. What's that went in there with the stuff on my head? It did start moving around he was very animated anyway to pull on we apologize for that Erron here, but again, we got it from the mo show Sounds very very actionable to me I think he owes them an apology. Don't you Just because hoodie Johnson happens to be a drooling Yahoo Redneck doesn't mean that they keep to Jews out of there anymore Any mo Which in these sends you diving to the dial the change stays in space to rest yesterday on our real famous pool on the aronters dot com Marlin's baseball 317 moth 300 to say oh by the way today's payday clearance Yippie yeah case clearance might be listen case he's awake yet.

He also told me to go for it myself. And I said back at you. That's a true story. WQAM? Yeah, hi, new old man. How are you? Fine, great show. Yes, it is. I'm having a good time. Yes, you are in great, wonderful form. Now let me tell you, I think to show that to go on in Iraq, although I'm afraid of my cause of counterattack, is that damn Phil Henry show. That would show them how truly hateful and venomous. Are you sure? Have you heard him to keep your blood pressure down? Yeah, I've heard about five minutes until I could take. I mean, he's worth some rush limbo. Well, he's trying to be a rush junior junior. I mean, but it's sincere. That's what's scary. No, it's not. Oh, man. I don't believe it. He's screaming at people who call and disagree with him. I mean, his blood pressure is gone. He's seen, he's got the memo from the people at their channel. He knows which side is but is butter on. But Neil, I mean, it's not easy. Tell me that's what makes it even worse is that I don't believe it is sincere. He's pandering. I can't believe it because he's too vain to, to, to, to, to, grow that completely and profoundly. Okay. And I wanted to tell you too, are you there? I'm here. Okay. So what if's worth Randy Rhodes speaks very well of you on the air? Well, you know, I actually tried listening to her yesterday on 1290, but I could just barely hear it and even in Broward, he can't get that signal very well. I know. And I heard that through her callers and believe me, you know, she's doing a good job and she's trying her best but the callers. It's like a light bulb radio all over again. You know, it's just not for me. Right. Good luck to you, Randy. You'll need it sweetheart. I like you though. Talking about old yentas. Okay. And I'm the feeling is mutual. Have a great day. Okay. Bye. Randy likes me. There you go. Well, well, well, just calm down, Randy. Quit taking yourself so seriously. But you doing a wonderful job to make your non-estation like a real market where somebody could hear you. Somebody says Dallas. I put it down, but I don't know why. What? Huh? The hell with that? I don't know. Don't ask me. I'm asking you. I don't know what the significance of this. Maybe the JR. JR you in. I don't know what that means. Is it the Texas desert? No, then I have a desert in Texas. Oh, is this a puts? It's dusty. Yeah, it's musty. And thus, you just put it down. Don't ask. It is not for us to ask. We just take orders. We're just here following orders. You know what I'm saying? You understand? The stop-okings track of everyone. That's why we're following orders. Real due to fleet. WQIN. Yes, for all of you. Yes, sir. Good morning. I would like to nominate the South Park movie. South Park would be good. Well, the movie because they show Saddam Hussein and Satan having gay sex. It is triggered. Okay.

Are you fucking kidding me? 22 till 10 at 5. 60 WQIN. What's going to be a great Thursday? I can smell it already. He's at that or molest at peace on a cheer in there. And it's watching all the way down my home. Maybe that's what got muffled a little under the weather. Maybe some maybe it was down. He was downwind from that crawling thing yesterday that was. He was spending too much time out in the hallway. We have agreed. I hate to say this, but you know me. Honest to the point of painful. We've all agreed. We took a poll. All three of us. Although during wooden agree because she still hates him like poison. She said, I asked her how the food was out there from California. Kitchens, she said it was molicious. She didn't. She really said that. See, you know her. But anyway, we agreed that there's about 5% of more Howard David in that. Really is a hoot. He's a hoot like 5% of like the wrong gene. I don't know that body and doesn't really fit there. The other 95% you wouldn't spit on the best part of it if you could find it. If it would sit still on his head. But there's about more if you could just like try to clone that 5% I mean we would love you. You know we'd have a great time. But you just you don't have it in your, you know, because you're a bag of pompous when that's the problem. Just like Skippy, you know, he's a bag. When you got for us today, no, no goods.

Well, for that you'll have to ask. I've heard five six set of 0.5 60 pound five 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. As we're building a magnificent list. You know, you can erick can actually put up the thing. I mean, he's got a good one saying. How many of you emailed him so far? None. I just emailed them the group of everything we've done since.

Ronnie would like to tell me he forgot the phone number. He'd like to tell the people over there if he could find out who's in charge. And passions, of course. I still say if you haven't seen Sheridan Audio. He had a rose out there. Man Sheridan on passion. She is. I can't imagine a more beautiful woman on a face of the earth. Okay. Give me a look like that. I'm just telling you she's blonde. She's beautiful. She's got a great body. She's everything you'd want. But because it's a silly ass. Not even just a soap opera but a comedy soap opera. I've never seen her. That's the only reason I gave you a book. Oh, I'm just telling you. It's a pretty good source. If I was of your persuasion. If I was a little spick. WQAM. Yes, sir. I don't. I love this. So I've been listening to this May, 1998. What? But. Yes. Are you doing button here? Mine is. I always know when you're about to make a drop because I hear that keyboard tapping. Yeah. He like you do right now. I can hear it. Yeah. I did that cause you just said it, too. Yeah, I see. I'm not planning anything but I just did that cause you said it. And also is it? Is it possible that all talking to those just have like some kind of psychic ability? Because whatever I'm out to say something, you guys like answer my question like not even a milliphre can have that. If there's a button. I smell it. I did that for you. I'm a psychic. Miss Cleo is a piker camera compared to me. Yeah, I can can George stay up permanently and keep calling us there. We're working on it. Let George. I'm like in this call better by the minute. Let George take all these effetecubes and I hear my min. Take them out of the big cruise to back the cube with the table. I think I know. I know. What do you say? At the end, you just got a little bit carried away. Something about. But so I'm going to yell like you. No, you don't like you. Specs is what he was trying to say. Well, beiner boys a little. He's a little one. Ficed. That's what most said. 560, 750, 560 pound. You know, and that whole hour did yesterday. We never played. More rapes Carlos. We've got to play that. We don't want to overdo that because it might actually come true. W to Q. I am. I'm pretty good. Hey, I'm. Love you. Show. I don't agree with you every time. Why not?

Well, goes to show you a matter of who he's sticking to. You're all right off the bat because the audience is picky. Okay. They got all of George damn. You're one of Paul yesterday about what sense of the way to change it out. The fastest sign of George's work. Well, you talk about a chronic factor. I mean, generally good. Facts is a good guy. It says the funny part of the most show this morning was him trying to do a hoody Johnson. He heard that it was so lame. His impression was not funny, but when Moe asked to call or what he thought of it. The caller said it was bad. He was being serious. He told Moe sounded like a New Yorker. I think it upset Moe's feeling. He then and guilty took some shot about Stanton Island. Of course, guilty talking about how somebody sounds. Yeah, I was really kind of silly in the first place. He put you up a little bit. You twirp. TV show. Be watch. Now we're talking. Yeah. That would be good. They watch for all those frustrated Iraqis. All are quite frankly from no way to been reproducing. I don't think there's. First it is some might seem, huh? Well, what else are they going to do? Have it on. He's been letting him do that. When nobody's watching. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T. Will the US taking over Iraqi TV and radio? What should be the first show on a year? Here's our shirtless so far. Are you hot American Idol? The Osborns? I don't see any other ones up there yet. Are you going to send this to him? Are you going to do that last call or heads with on to something? No, I said it to already. Well, he doesn't have it yet. He is a slow as molasses on a July day in the equator. God is he slow. But. He just told me to say that, Eric. Don't take it personal. He just looked me and I said the ripman asked. That time for Bonzo passions, I dream of Jeannie. Phil Henry show because he's... Are you sure? Dallas, South Park movie, the Gong show, Saturday night live, Oprah and Baywatch. Hopefully not the ones with Pamela Sue Anderson. Because Georgia get really upset. Are we putting any of those guns smoke bananas? Yeah, put guns smoke on there. That would be good. Gun smoke. Although probably that would be rubbing it in. But you put it on there anyway. I guess by now they probably used to it. Especially the smoke part. God. Man, can you imagine what breeding the air must be like there? Whoa. And they also have a shortage of water I'd like to put in. We got some really good articles on our website today that Bina Boyz busy putting on. There will be rip and Bina Boyz okay. He's working his ass off to put that information on there. Also, I heard mol and guilty may reference to this. Says although the fate of Sodom who's saying is unknown as his rule crumbles in bag that he's driving as a collectible on eBay. During the three week war in Iraq collectives have swamped the internet trading site with more than a thousand items including Iraqi money, t-shirts and videos that capitalize on Sodom's notoriety. One seller telling the Sodom Dinar one of two currencies used in Iraq was quick to advise his items a piece of history certain to grow in value when the war is over. And like I said yesterday when rumors about those free dinners he's going to be over with a fork and spoon and knife. With a current world situation chances are this will be the last currency available coming out of Iraq at least with Sodom's picture on it to sell a road. Iraq's Sodom Dinar was by far the most popular item with some options fetching. About $400 for a few bills. They're fetching and worth fetching. At the end of March $1 could be a change for about 3,000 Iraqi bills. A search for Sodom on eBay. What is this? A search for Sodom who's saying on the eBay website you'll do 900 hits involving a wide variety of items associated with them. This particular story from CNN isn't as good as the other one that I passed on about the they've got heads, Sodom heads like the ones at the Yankeh to have the stance when they were coming back. They've got those as well. Well, they must be producing them. Yes. Well, not the one from this. Did you realize that that was, what was that made? That was it. Granite. I heard bronze. I'm sorry, bronze. That's why I said bronze. Don't take it for Granite. Then I know what I'm talking about because I'm going to go here from that food this morning. It was very good though, but don't do that again during your pitch. For anyone eager to get Sodom's on a graph 15, but there's a push to price of an auto Sodom to 23 bucks and autograph photo of some. You know, see, of course, to show you, what did I say during that all Jay Gautron a year ago, huh? Same thing. Some of you people have no principles at all. Here's a guy that killed two people and called, but well, it might be worth something someday. Oh, my God. Give me a break. Talk about a total sellout. Autograph pictures of Sodom who's saying you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I'm going to tell you right now as much as we may have very, very serious political differences. This is those people off eBay and send them to the bushmeister. That's right. We're going to send them to Harvon Gering, Rumsfeld personal. You'll notice speaking of Harvon Gering, Rumsfeld, that has got a big, pompous thing yesterday, who was, uh, high-prevent-living about Syria once again. Those, he's not just wrapped in that in there for the fun of it. There's a message in there like, hey, are you, they keep saying, well, the troops are exhausted and they want to come home, which we can certainly understand that. But, uh, I have a feeling they're not going to be coming home. Not directly. They're going to make a slight move to the west, but not very far. Syria will be next. That's what they got in mind if they can get away with it. Syria is going to be next. That's what they in Ariel, Sherron. They're other good right-winged Jew buddies, Nizville. They've got in mind. That's what it's all about. Tragic. And those are the rest of us Jews that we can't even get into goddamn Augusta, Kornimo. Hey, well get your facts, Ray. That's really an outrageous comment to make. So we either have to trust him and, uh, creeper or we believe the car who made a good point. And that is that the guy who resigned over the, uh, who he Johnson, uh, Martha Burke business, the, the women business, that guy was obviously Jewish. And if he was on a board of directors, he's obviously a member. So let's find out who's telling the truth and who's full of crap. Huh? Let's investigate this. Is this thing up here yet? Because I'm voting for passions. I'll tell you right now. I think I think it'll be the, oh, talk about putting a smile on their face. Then of course, once they saw Shannon, I mean, to share in whatever her name is. Not Shannon. Shannon, that's a real throwback to some other stuff that we had on the show, Longro. Shannon, I thought, no. Yeah, that's right. 567.0560, pound 560 on the AT&T. Oh, look at this NBC camera catches battle under Baghdad Bridge. It's also a luxury, I think, of the fact that the real problem is rapidly becoming one. Not simply of cleaning out these few holdouts that are holding us whatever reason. But they're lazy hearing out. Not a story restoring order stopping the looting and getting the city back to normality. Yeah, they're maybe more like that. And Colonel, how long will that take you? Weeks, months? How long do we, who live for the more skirmishes like we're seeing here? I would guess that these kind of skirmishes will probably start dying out very, very rapidly. As it becomes clear to whoever these guys are that there simply nothing above them and that they're completely on the right. Yeah, but we want to know how many days before this winds down, Colonel. But third man. Here's a fact says here's the info you wanted. I let three lies. The fugitive, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and definitely gunsmoke. Well, one out of four ain't bad. Thank you, Gene. G-roges. Good guy. Probably ridded related somewhere, Longroly, phony, family, tree, I've created. Let's see. Now that Sodom has gone assuming the rest of her records away. Have one basic comment. I feel much safer and secure and I don't you? No, no. Did this make a sin till a difference in any Americans like other than those killed or made a torture over there in their families? No. Uh, as for real show, the price is right in the hockey night in Canada. Not the broadcast to get last night. I'll play to that. Somebody poke Bob Cole on the ribs. Will you please? Hey, Koli, talking about a bad head of hair. Man, get with it. He was just awful last night. Just horrible. awful. And Harry Neil poor Harry wasn't too much better. Talk about the blind leading the blind. That was a bad telecast last night, A on CBC. And various for you guys. Now we already, we've read this thing from here. I'm not hearing what about how many times we read this. I got to get rid of that already. Okay. We appreciate the faxes, but we read that line from her and Gary. I see. I got indigestion now. I'm gripped from that breakfast. It was delicious. I just can't be eaten. Okay. You know that. I shouldn't have done that. But it would look great. Did I eat in the pizza? No, it looked healthy too. Oh yeah. It was a salad. Oh stop. Looked healthy. See, this is such. Don't know why that crap on me. Okay. What I mean is that healthy. Yeah. Well, first of all, wasn't green. The salad part was green. That's a part that's throughout. What? It's the greens. Are you crazy? I had to blue cheese and they crumbled the bacon stuff. Not the bacon bits but real bacon. Hmm. And what was on it? It was an of course a little tiny onion rings. Not not big onion rings. There's that would be bad. But little skinny ones. See, plenty of those. 9.57 at 5.60WQ.

I'm gonna use run the way! 10-02-5-60 WCM happy Thursday 2 we got the mad dog with his last day and our Gust up there where they do allow Jews and they do allow to a black spagist no a woman. What about black Jewish women? Definitely not. Carlos is shaking his head and he spun it all around the one time like window blur. What do we got? Hank is in a studio of 3. Marlins on Dreckets 630. 7-0-7-0-5 Marlins in the mess. Marlins 1 last night. 3-2, anybody interested? Ed Kaplan after the baseball game in Joan Mark overnight. Nobody cares. Nobody care and again see that 10,000 in a sum odd just barely over 10,000 in an ounce crowd of which probably 6,500 men stands. What are we for rain drops last night into the vicinity of the Estadium? Huh? That's a good excuse. Boy it's pretty sad and like I said it could be to dead horse okay then nobody kind of come out okay they don't care. I understand this supposed to be a sports station in town where nobody cares about sports other than the dolphins the choking gagging dolphins the highly overrated dolphins. Boy do you think that they like to have tiny brady a quarterback to dolphins? You kidding me? Oh, I shouldn't say that's so close to Passover you know what? Jay will take it personal. The rat patrol on F tube. I don't think so. I mean don't take it personal. There's just too many suggestions on here. We can't have 600 names on Luskuz and Eruckel freak out. Just this up by the way South Park movie is winning nine, gone show five. It just went up moments ago. Steven and Scott Taylor is on a house of going steve. Among the TV shows the newly freed Iraqi should be subjected to oh yeah I agree with this Benny Hinn on the Trinity broadcasting network. Benny Hinn just put Benny Hinn H. I. I. Benny H. Also somebody said the J.A. Springer show? Definitely. New Roger show? Sure. Colliente which is on Saturday afternoon. I guess with a lot of hot naked bands or something on SpikTV. And one more. I'm Reinshow before MTV screwed him all up. I agree with that. Get them all on there. Got him good. Here's one that says on the same network with a show. When that funny bitch with a pink hair and help the Iraqi say, I'm good American value such as intolerance and bigotry. Why? The show with a funny bitch with a pink hair. 10 croch. Are you starting about Jan Paul Crotch? No but we got it. She gets stars on Benny Hinn every once in a while. In addition, which didn't you tell me they already have a transmitter there in the middle of the desert somewhere? You're probably watching Jan and Paul Crotch right now. That's why they hate America. Bush broadcasting can submit them to DJames Kennedy reclaimed America for Christ and part two conquest Iraq. Okay well. Can't put them all on America. I said quote by your head. Stutter and Gill and Homestead is the one who uh, fact in Colliente. He said it's on Saturday's 2 p.m. on Telemundo. Babes dancing, the latest tunes and songs to the latest songs. Holdings heroes. I can't wait till they see Jamie far. Was that on Hogan's heroes? Was that on mash? I never watched either one of them so I don't know. Huh? Oh that's right. What am I asking you for punk? Here's what it says. The movie The Mouse That Rored. I guess only old thoughts would know this. Look about a teeny tiny community in possession of the bomb. Had the US on its knees. Don't put that on there. We don't want them to see us on our knees. Okay. No comment. Oh I didn't notice that rum spell was asking the incident in the press conference that they had discovered that it was true about the incredibly high percentage of almost six rally in that country. 560560. 556 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line rolling along sing in a song. Oh I got a great column. I'm going to have a couple of bedtime stories today. You know the one by Michael Moore. Ha ha. How do you like that? My Oscar backlash stupid white man back at number one and bowling for Columbine breaks new record. Oh yeah. Oh they sure fixed him up. Just like the Dixie Ticks which he writes about in here too, which there sells to their records of shot through the roof. Oh yeah. So all these statistics about well 70% of the people are pissed off and Michael Moore's an asshole and no more Dixie Ticks. The only people I want to buy the Dixie Ticks are the who's listening to kiss. That's all. You know the ones I'm talking about the ones who are coo- Coo- Coo- Coo- Coo- Maybe they hang out on a can-coo but I doubt that they don't like them down there. And vice versa. Who do Johnson man? So more bad misinformation. I want to hear that apology on a more Howard David show tomorrow. To come on here and say that well maybe they just have their names on list. Maybe it has nothing to do with Jewish. Maybe they just got guilty, Mo and Robert Creeper self-hating Jew. Maybe they just have those on a long list of people that they will not admit in August. Maybe that's the reason Mo ain't broadcasting for me this year. Maybe he got the message. He's been blacklisted. Did you say blacklisted? 560560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. WQAM. Hey Neil. Yes sir. What? I don't understand what kind of TV shows these people are talking about. What we got to do is bring Moids over there and to reach company and have two reasons for that. Okay. All right. Moids will get the Janet Reno in there. They'll get used to these Janet Reno bitches being able to do whatever they want because that's America is. With the company willing to do STEM. Hey guess what? We have sex. You know, we'll get all that. Okay. Thanks a lot Tom. I guess he hasn't seen that half of the population there's under the age of 15. So somebody's been doing it off a lot of breeding. In other words, they don't live very long. Right. That's why the demographic is so low. They don't live very long. Unlike down here, where course, the meaning age is death plus 10. But they lost one or two people in the Gulf War and in the Iran thing. See there you go. I'm trying to do a light show today.

Okay, set to the refrigerator. That's the only place he makes an exception moves real fast at the drive through and also the refrigerator. I'm in this past 10 at 560 WQM.

And write some to change without notice 5.34 APR. 5. Your sports video 560-USUAM. They don't come any better than Neil Roger. We now bring you sedan who's saying why. My troops were fighting diligently and I assured everybody for the Iraqi people. What do we need? That is not sedum. Sedum does not have red hair and freckles. But it is hard to tell because of the sombrero. Look at that carlose hat. Are reaching his pocket and give him a change for his paycheck. I'll come even out of your check and I don't have money. I don't have money. I just asked him if he had change. What are you just bringing here? I thought he just brought checks in here. He told me he didn't have change and he came to show me his empty wall. I don't come back any way without any cash. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Unless you have cash. Can you believe that? I thought for sure he had envelopes in his hand. He had to smile on his post. I just turned it down to 100 and he had the ovens cranked up. I thought it was just me. It was small to bring in here. Once again more assholes in here at night. Dicking around with everything in this studio. Dicking with a thermostat. Stealing that beverages. Stealing carloses. Cokes. Stealing George's Coke. Here's the facts from Bill who says. I believe most confused about the exclusion of certain individuals from membership of the Augusta National Golfbub stems from a portion of their membership policy, which he apparently slightly misheard. He understood them to say they don't allow people of the Jewish faith when actually what they said was they don't allow egotistical elderly putwacking assholes with smelly ridiculous looking hairpieces in two first names. Simple mistakes as facts are bill. Good point Bill. Here's another one from Calvin who says, what the facts are pouring in. The votes are starting to pouring on that poll. Do you have three companies in mod? And Hogan's Heroes? Hogan's Heroes? Yes, I didn't think we were going to put three companies in mod. Why not? What? Why not? Just because that guy was like a little off. Right. That's okay. We like our people a little bit off. And most of them don't disappoint. Calvin says, was all this mongering so we could go to over to Baghdad and turn on a statute while the answer is Calvin is not just a statute, but they toured on I want to curcook this morning. Oh, I guess he must have missed out to big news. We had to write here. Yeah, when I hit the ground, it was exciting. So as I don't think there's anything more discussing than Dick coming out of his whole land, we haven't seen Vice President Dick for a long time, by the way, I'm notice. And boasting about how our military kicked a crap out of a third rate army. Or he should say, what's left of a third rate army? There are some hundred odd families out there who might not feel so proud since their loved ones are coming home in a box. Not to mention, of course, the thousands of families in Iraq have innocent Vice vendors who's probably won't come home at all. Be sure to fasten your seat belts because Rommie said yesterday that there's intelligence that saw the might have stored some of his WMDs in Syria, sounds plausible. And after that Iran, Lebanon, questioned Mark, saw the might even have FedEx under Canada. Did they have any tall statues in Toronto? No, only the CN Tower. Hmm. I just mentioned that in passing. And of course, they're gigantic stance we were frank, Mahavulich. Here's the fact that says, here's an absolute must see for t- Ha ha ha ha. Now this is bad. This is in very poor taste. No, it is. It's bad. But I like it. Must see TV for Iraq. Any or perhaps all of the dental care informers. Thanks Robin, Pablo Beach. We don't put that on her because it's in very poor taste. But he does have a point. In fact, I would say the next to the British. They have someone to worst teeth that ever seen. But probably they don't have real good like dental care. The British have no excuse. They like America. They probably don't have real good medical care plans. I just mentioned that in passing. South Park movie 19. Now that US has taken over radio and TV in Iraq, what should be the first show on a year? South Park movie 19. Gong showed 12. They watch 11. The Osborne's 11. The Phil Henry show. Are you sure? 9. American Idol 9. Saturday night live 8. I dream of Jeannie has got 5. I don't see. Oh yeah, that's right. We got looking at. I don't have any yet. Just put those on there. Right here. Oh, God. American Idol's got 9 like I said. I already did these. Are you on 5. Many in 3. Passions only 3. Oprah has only got 3 votes. How do you like that? I can easily understand why because Oprah blows. Should I get 10? I do this one. In fact, I'm not going to read anything until we get to pay checks. We ought to go on strike till we get our pay checks. We shouldn't have to go through this if we pay it. Clarence ought to be at that door. He ought to be bursting through that door with a big smile on his face. Here you go, guys. Just throw in money at us, you know. Kind of crap that goes on next. Or he's busy with sports. That's right. He's busy with ball games. Although he's another one. He wouldn't know a hockey puck if they stuck one up his ass. But he might enjoy it. Yeah. It would be a noob experience for clearance. My Oscar backlash stupid white men back at number one. Bowling breaks new records writes Michael Moore. Dear friends, he says. It appears that the Bush administration will have succeeded in colonizing Iraq sometime the next few days. There's a Blunder of such magnitude. This is a Blunder of such magnitude and we'll pay for it for years to come. It wasn't worth the life of one single American kid in uniform. Let alone the thousands of Iraqis who have died and my condolences and prayers go out to all of them. So where are all those weapons of mass destruction that were the pretense for this war? There's so much to say about all this but I'll save it for later. What I'm most concerned about right now is that all of you with the majority of Americans who did not support this war in the first place not go silent or be intimidated by what will be touted as some great military victory. Now more than ever the voices of peace and truth must be heard. I received a lot of mail from people who are feeling a profound sense of despair and believe that their voices have been drowned out by the drums and bombs of false patriotism. Some are afraid of retaliation and worker at school or in their neighborhood because they've have been vocal proponents of peace. They've been told over and over that it's not appropriate to protest once the country is at war and that you're only duty now is to support the troops. Can I share with you what's been like for me since I used my time on the Oscar stage to we should go to speak out against Bush in this war? I hope that in a meeting when I'm about to tell you you'll feel a bit more involved and to make your voice heard in whatever way or form that is open to you. When Boling for Columbine was announced as the Oscar winner for Best Documentary at the Academy Awards, the audience rose to its feet. It was a great moment when that always cherished. They were standing ensuring for a film that says we Americans are a uniquely violent people using our massive stash of guns to kill each other and use them against many countries around the world. They were plotting a film that shows George W. Bush using fictitious fears to frighten the public into giving him whatever he wants and they were honoring a film that states to follow. The first Gulf War was an attempt to reinstall the dictator of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein was armed with weapons from the US and the American governments responsible for that's a half a million children. They rack over the past decade to its sanctions and bombing. That was the movie they were cheering and that was the movie they voted for. So I decided this is the way I showed an object my speech and thus I said following the following from the Oscar stage. On behalf of our producers Kathleen, Glenn and Michael Donovan from Canada, I'd like to thank the Academy for this award. I've invited the other documentary nominees on the stage with me. They're here in solidarity because we like non-fiction. We like non-fiction because we live in fictitious times, we live in a time where fictitious election results give us a fictitious president. We're not fighting a war for fictitious reasons. Whether it's the fiction of duct tape or fictitious orange alerts, we were against this war, Mr. Bush, shame on you, Mr. Bush, shame on you. And whenever you've got to the Pope and the Dixie chicks against you, your time is up. Halfway through I remarked somebody the audience started to cheer that immediately set off a group of people in a balcony who started to boo. Then no supporting my remarks started to shout down the boars, the LA Times reported that the director of the show started to scream at the orchestra, music music in order to cut me off so the bandhoodfully struck up a tune in my time was up. The next day, and the two weeks since the right wing pundits and radio shock talks have been calling for my head, so as all this ruckus hurt me, had they succeeded in silencing me, but take a look at my Oscar backlash. On the day after I criticized Bush and the Worthy Academy Awards attendance at bowling for Columbine and theaters around a country when up 110%. The following week the box office group was a gross was up a whopping 73%. It is now the longest running consecutive commercial release in America, 26 weeks in a row until thriving. The number of theaters showing the film since the Oscars has increased, and it is now best to the previous box office record for documentary by nearly 300%. A couple of days ago April 6, stupid white men shot back to number one on the New York Times bestseller list. This is my book's 50th week on the list, either the number one, and marks its fourth return to the top position something that virtually never happens. In the week after the Oscars my website was getting 10 to 20 million hits a day, one day we've got more hits than the White House. The mail has been overwhelmingly positive and supportive in the hate mail has been hilarious. In the two days following the Oscars more people peer to the video for bowling for Columbine and Amazon.com than the video for the Oscar winner for Best Picture Chicago. In the past week I've obtained funding for my next documentary, and I've been offered a slot back on TV to do an updated version of TV Nation The Ophal Truth. I tell you all this because I want to counteract the missions that told us all the time that if you take a chance to speak out politically you'll live to regret it. It'll hurt you in some way usually financially you could lose your job, others may not hire you to lose friends and on and on and on. Take the Dizzy Ticks. I'm sure you've all heard by now that because their lead singer mentioned how she was ashamed that Bush was from her homestay to Texas, their record sales have plummeted and country stations are boycotting their music. The truth is their sales are not down. This week after all the attacks their album is still number one on the Billboard Country charts and according to entertainment weekly on the pop charts during all the Bruha they rose from number 6 to number 4. In the New York Times Frank Rich reports he tried to find a ticket to any of the XTX upcoming concerts but he couldn't because they were all sold out. Their song Travel and Soldier a beautiful anti-war ballad was the most requested song on the internet last week. They haven't been heard at all but that's not what the media would have you believe. Why is that? Because there's nothing more important now than to keep the voices of the sent and those of you who would dare to ask a question silent. And what better way than to try and take a few well-known entertainers down with a pack of lies so the average Joe or Jane gets the message loud and clear. While if they would do that to the Dizzy Ticks or Michael Moore, what would they do to little old me in other words shut the F up? And that my friends is the real point of this film that I just got a Oscar for how those in charge use fear to manipulate the public and doing whatever they're told. While the good news if there can be any good news this week is not that only have neither I or any others been silent. So enjoy by millions of Americans who think the same way we do. Don't let the false patriots intimidate you by setting the agenda or the terms of the debate. Don't be defeated by the polls that show 70% of the public in favor of the war. Remember that these Americans being pulled out of the same Americans whose kids or neighbors kids have been sent over to Iraq. They're scared for the troops and they're being cout into supporting war they didn't want and they want even less to see their friends family and neighbors come home dead. Everyone supports the troops returning home alive and all of us need to reach out let their families know that. Unfortunately, Bush and company are true yet. This invasion in conquest will encourage them to do it again elsewhere. The real purpose of this war was to save the rest of the world. Don't mess with Texas if you got what we want we're coming to get it. This is not the time for the majority of us who believe in peaceful America to be quiet. Make your voices heard despite what they pulled off. It is still our country says Michael Moore. I'm going Mike. I'm going A. I still don't have my copy of all in for column buying it. But I can give them Amazon.com. I thought you'd already ordered it. No I have not. There's currents with a money. Alright, here is our favorite person in the world. I'll tell you that right now this guy. I guarantee any woman that would turn his advances down is got to be an idiot. He is hung like a moose. He's got a person out. Ah, that's what I'm hearing. You're the best clearance. Get out of here. You can stop by. Yeah, we got our money now. We're not after you cash it. And by the way, when you go to the bank to do the same thing you do with my check. Okay, we sure have them call the company. Make sure that it's legit. Because when they take a look at you and say, Oh, you're getting them. You got to check for anything. I'll say, who you can. That's just that you don't just know. Look like the kind of person that would get paid for anything. No, that didn't have the security guard block the door. Well, they called you. Yeah. Yeah. If I had to do over again, you just, you know, fun with you. But just to screw with you a little. Like I do with mode this morning. Got to wish we we should have filmed that. You know, something get 140 share in this building. If the crowd here could have seen that. Could have seen me in it with a musk right on my head. I thought most eyes are going to pop right out of his eyeballs. It was great. Miguel, he don't have time for your crappy busy looking at naked pictures on the internet. Now, we got our package yet, Miguel. Fred, I think we'd like to do that hot couple thing again. But I mean, you know, I mean, at least Doreen come through with us for a lot of food this morning. You know, she said it was malicious. But poor, Mcwell, man. We're like, ask an asking. And he's just dittler around, you know, dittler around. Sometime this year would be good, Miguel. Huh? He's waiting for replies from the other people involved in giving us the prices. Wow. Okay. We'll keep you posted folks. Inhale right now. And we'll let you know what he can let it out and your breath through. Now that he was just taking over local Iraqi radio and TV, what should be the first show on here is what our question is on eorangers.com. Another nifty poll if you ask me. 145 votes already on here. And we're still building the list. We're still building our poll. South Park movie 26. I'm trying to think about, I think I actually saw the South Park movie. Where would I have seen that? I think when I was in Toronto, I saw that thing. Because that bunch of assholes. The film 100 show 13, the Osborne 13, Baywatch 12, Gong show 12, Neil Rogers shows zipin up their fast. 11. How do you like that? Ew, good. That's what you, that'll be a cool day in the hell before they lift this show on here over there. Saturday night live 11 to American Idol 11. Dream of G.D.7, Jerry Spinger show five. Are you hot five? Benny, Hen, four. Look at that. I just say, are you hot in right away. My girl's nodding and said, oh boy. Man, these people with egos, you know, no one who gets along with most so well. I know he's busy. He's on a computer looking at naked pictures. Like always. Well, George ain't here to share with him. So he's got to do something. I heard George does share with him. I treasure out loud. So always the story treasure out last night. Anybody get lucky there. What? Well, I kept getting pod. I get pod more than most of the women there. Yeah. By the strippers. You were pod by the strippers. I thought maybe by some of our regular chronics were plying over you. Since I can't get close to the strippers. Maybe fat boy was there upon over little beiner boy, huh? Actually, fat boy and me go had a little booth in the back of themselves. Did they really? Yeah. Was cute. Hmm. Video and 11. 10 27 at 560 WQM out there. That clearance there is nobody like Clarence Dero in the world, you know. He is the best. You ask for money and he's got it. This comes in here with a big smile on his face. All you ladies out there speaking of hot couples. Seriously, let's get him laid this year. This year just once. Just to show you that we appreciate profoundly the fact that he actually delivers the cash. The bees these are too happy, but they like him the stall. But he brings it on the day that's due to be delivered. This year? There's only 7 months left? Yeah. There's only 7 months left? For this year? 8.5. 5.5. 5.5. 10.7.5. What an idiot. Now look at it. Now he's caught. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh! And McGill goes to the calendar. Now he's counting the months off the calendar, ok. If this is the fourth month of the year, Carlos, how many months are left after you? But look at him halfway. He's got 8 and a half long months. He can almost not come to that period of time. Come on. Saw you. Ladies out there. All you sluts in the audience. They want it really bad. From anybody who would even do beat or boy. I mean, I understand that. that you know, Clarence's got bad breath and he talks a lot of crap and he will bite your arm up and down one side of the other, but in a mean to if you can ignore that. Just where like a body suit, you some of that duct tape over his push. Hey, I'll tell you a place where you're gonna have a great time for lunch or dinner late night snacks and that's the world famous pizza loft and now it pass over only days away. They've got that notorious moths of pizza. It is unleavened for paysach, whatever it hell that means. Even the goi mends where the moths of pizza every year in a moth's alazagna as well. Delicious even better I think than the original stuff that's how good it is. So now there's four kinds of pizza for you to enjoy the pizza loft. They've got every kind of pasta dish out of the sun. They've got chicken and feel seafood, fugas of pizza, calzone super subs and the prices are teeny and tiny the food is fresh and delicious and they've also now got two great locations for you at the pizza loft. The original Broward location as you know. It's right beyond pure one imports on university drive between Grypton 595 right across in the complex where the rumors and eddy Jones live. We're taking out delivery in catering called 954 916888. 954 916888 don't forget great catering as low as 5x per person for any affair you've got coming up. Jeff knows as affairs and now the new Broward location is out by me in West Broward and that's a corner not hill and sunrise behind Walgreens and that trip shopping center. Not easy to see from the street but they got plenty of reparking right in front of the joint and the food is the same great food and the same low prices at the plantation pizza loft called 954 3a 299. It's a fantastic place to take the whole gang in here to swing in for a feast at a price that just a pit and even remember we'll pick up the check at the Royal Famous Pizza loft two locations in Broward. And what? This is 4255. What a good gun. When you get a yeast infection you use one of those messy creams so to count there may be an easier way. It's a pill, Zyclican. Just one pill is as effective as the leading seven day cream without the mask. Okay. Do not use Zyclican if you are nursing. If you are pregnant or taking other medications, talk to your doctor. Do not take Zyclican if you are taking Pulse it. But it's not like my vagina is going to explode or release. Oh no! It's gross! And even if the pig ranch could fix the vet.

I'm so anyway Miguel is researching the thing about Jews that are gusting whether they can be members of the club or not. That's one call we had I think that said it all.

I ironically Howard show has been censored now more than ever by the same regime. He supports dumb Howard As your father said long ago, don't be so stupid you moron fill in market and you might be interested fill in knowing speaking the Things censored the SEC now is threatening infinity broadcasting for whom Howard works That if they ever get another one of the major fines are gonna well yank their licenses since they've paid millions and Millions and millions of dollars of fines over the years Yeah, the SEC can can yank their license. Oh, absolutely I thought they just couldn't renew No, no, no, they can be both your license How about that so you know I don't know what he thinks he's better accomplished by his pantry or maybe that has something to do with it I have no idea But I never really considered Howard the stern or even Howard David to be like a great political analyst you know what I say I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so stick to the dice.

world scene in international in the very german that works like zdf and dr three sat is not all that different the main difference seems to be an extra layer of editorial spin the american that we're sad the european outlets in not to have the need to go into lowest common denominator explanations for every story they're showing the stories are a lot of speak for themselves and there's just as much coverage of pentagon and u.s.uk field commander press conferences as there are any u.s. channel as an example the Iraqi information minister rako's on about that one other comment while american commanders match up with the u.k. counter parts as far as being spoken well interviews with british and listed men come across as honest even thoughtful while the american troops on speaking and acting but no commentary by reporters rakers seem only to be enforced the worst year is spring and landspads that's but we don't want to knock the troops i mean there are a bunch of kids most of them in addition to which uh... not therefore that's america for you man the education system here sucks to compare the american education with the brit i'm sorry but we're just not as polished as they are

about that's why we had those sanctions on last 12 years including the first two years of the administration who is kidding whom and including the last two of a bush one by the way after the go go for one there's a great column here it's a little bit old from the chicago tributian by Charles wrangle congressman from New York the war in a racker will not be intimidated shon had a decayable tv talk show host recently challenged my patriotism twisting my words to a ledge i'd said our troops were deliberately bombing women and children in a rack nothing could be further from the truth rights Charlie while pointing out that in all wars innocent people are killed i emphasized that american troops are actually going out of their way to avoid harming non-combatans this places our soldiers and even greater danger because in a rack they don't know who the enemy is whether uniform soldiers are really surrendering or with a man and women in the feet close our suicide bombers no matter how smart our high tech weapon we may be bombs and missiles can go astray and accidentally strike down combatants such was the case reported in the press last week more than 50 civilians were killed by an air missile that exploded in the crowded market and bagged at again this is dated March 28 well chon had it is not know because he didn't serve in the armed forces is that soldiers obey the orders of the commander and chief our troops are doing that but if we were not in this war there'd be no bombing at all and it wouldn't be necessary to consider the issue of collateral damage handedly also refused to accept the fact that we started this war and rejecting the well the international community interjected ourselves in the dispute between the UN and Iraq nothing is more precious to Americans than our freedom to speak out to disagree it's frightening that in their passion for this war some people are accusing anyone who opposes it of being on patriotic if members of congress are going to be attacked for a full-filling their response voted their constituents to speak out on matters of war and peace that we might as well tear up the constitution i don't support the war but i refer the troops and i'm graphing legislation that will show an tangible way the country's appreciation for their sacrifice the program will provide generous higher education and health care benefits for the troops after their discharge their spouses and their children for those who wish to go into business it will provide the necessary resources i hope that support is the war who are questioning the oil of its opponents will support this initiative so we can provide a meaningful welcome on the troops come home demonizing the centers to become the favorite tactic of the most of us if our supporters of this war in Iraq at the same time they're stifling debate manipulating public opinion distorting the fact about the loss of lives betraying our troops and defiling the constitution those who oppose the world continue to be vilified for some by some for their principal beliefs i will continue speaking out for peace on behalf of my constituents in the name of the west constitution i will not be intimidated right charlie rangol in the march twenty shiikara tribune i spell charlie you're okay my book he's a hoot and he wants to do something for our troops he's actually proposed legislation as opposed to course the administration who are cutting veterans benefits at a time when we're sending hundreds of thousands of young American kids over there with with who knows what

admit it here's an article in the Salt Lake City you taught tribune my brain is real sin uh oh koi city the headline is will arack be free like koi originally go to the mean to disarm Sudan who said i'm who's saying now now it's talking like a president because i'm sada Sudan has saying if you notice that i'm starting to talk like him mull mull mull mull mull mull mull mull mull mull mull maybe i can get elected too let's do an lesson originally bill is a means to disarm Sudan who's saying of his weapons of mass destruction the war in Iraq soon became one of a liberation military officials from the genitals in the command center these soldiers online talked about freeing the Iraqi people the poor oppressed Iraqi people but if freedom and liberty are what they're fighting for in Iraq you as a British troops should nextrin their sights on their host koi the soil from which the war against Iraq has been and stages his home-to-away sectarian government that is yet to withstand basic individual rights to all. Although Kuwait's ruling family begrudgingly brought back and elected parliament in 1992 after six year absence, power remains firmly in the hands of the ruling Assa Bhav family, which fancies itself as a benevolent monarchy that governs according to Islamic Orthodoxy. It proclaims ideals of freedom however so have far have fallen short of the ideal, women here cannot vote in a whole political or judicial office, naturalized male citizens of non-quay to dissent must wait 30 years for such privileges. The formation of political parties or other associations for political purposes is illegal. Now I'm trying to think, oh that's right, it wasn't Kuwait, it was gutter that they had that surround 60 minutes couple weeks ago. Which story? About the women can vote and they hold off as it wasn't Kuwait. The formation of political parties or other associations for political purposes is illegal, only Kuwait is can own property. The country's 100,000 veterans, a tournament chapellers whose people have room these parts for centuries, have no legal national status and are regularly deported and done access to state social services. Israelis in recent visitors to Israel cannot travel here. Oh, the Kuwaiti media were strictly by numerous laws rarely criticizes the government, religious leaders or members of the ruling family. In addition to laws that in fringe on basic human rights, the state's official version of Islam has inspired laws that can seem oppressive to non-believers. Don't even try to bring Rodin's kiss here. And I say, Rodin, what do I know about art? You know? One Kuwaiti law provides a three-year prisonster in a tenth-alem burasing and a $10,000 or five for anyone to distribute their exhibit pictures and drawings in forms of anything immoral. Alcohol and extramurnal sex also strictly prohibited by law. Just this month, the famous Kuwaiti artist was arrested after a police thought a case of vodka in his car. Oh my god. Wait till they find out that precious is drinking gin on passions. Despite the government's spotty record on personal freedom, Kuwaiti's probably will not be liberated by British and American troops anytime soon. The average emerald is pro-westerns for us anybody knows because this is no weapons of mass destruction. How do you like that, huh? Kuwaiti's Kuwaiti's good, Saudi's good, Syrians not too good, Iranians pretty, pretty bad. Pakistanis? This week not too bad. Maybe next week we change our mind and come back to reality. Turks? Turks, we don't like that nor even a 16 billion we couldn't have arrived more than. Pistoff it then. Let's go in and get the puppies. WQAM? How are you doing? Pretty good. Good. You know, I was coming through a local music magazine the other day. Yes sir? I'm page 35 man, you're post-popped up. I can believe it. I look at your music magazine. Yeah, it's called Rag magazine. I'm serious. You're on page 35. A big headshot of it. I was in a position. Please, your company's spent a couple hundred bucks on this. It was an ad? Yeah, for you. The company's spent any money on this. Well, what was it? That was a little trade-off though. I was a trade-off. They didn't spend a dime. You can be. Well, it's at least it's something you're right. It's a... You know, it was kind of odd because it's a great little local magazine I was just surprised I see your put the computer. Anyway, how are you doing? Okay, thanks. Thanks for your good news. What is it called? Rag magazine. Rag? Yeah. Tell me. Tell me. Set that up for us. Oh. Are we in spending money? We got those billboards out there all over time and when my big push on it. And on the turnpug now, they moved the one from the intersection to 590 from the turnpug to one. I'm right on most ash now as I'm working with him. Right on his ash. How do you like that, Mo?

I got a lot of a lot of experience. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Suicide bomber strikes it downtown back that checkpoint. Sassination of two prominent clerics inside the Ali Moss in on the jump. We're going to go to the phone right now and Trudy Rubin joins us. She really who filed one of these clerics for her paper, the Philadelphia and choir. Trudy, what do you have for you? Well, this is a very significant development because this man sighed Abdul Masjid Al-Fui had come into Najaf with American forces and the US government at the highest level that placed great hopes on what he was going to do. This is a bunch of who's the son of the man who was the leading chia, Ayatola in the world at the time of the Gulf War, Anayatola who enjoys the separation. In a fancy who he made, she said. She says the younger Al-Fui who was a son of a woman. She had come back and was going around to towns around Najaf trying to line up religious leaders to work with the Americans and to work for a democratic Iraq. And so his assassination is a serious blow to US efforts in the south to get religious leadership behind the kind of changes that the president says he wants in Iraq. Okay, that's enough. Wow, just to sit and back there, getting all these taxes off of the machine, almost let her continue battling on her after she said. 11 past noon is 5.60.

So how when you look back to American history we had you know John Adams and his son was John Quincy Adams these second and sixth presidents You know who needed that one per family I mean we had Teddy Roosevelt and FDR but they they were like cousins. I'm not sure they I think they were like second cousins Were they yeah there were some like weird ass cousin cousins no kissing cousin yeah, no, they were not you sure positive. How do you know I was there? Eleanor told me what she was busy Why don't we had the JFK and then if we're grooming the Bobby of course and then not did work out And then what else that's it? And then we got the bush one and bush two and of course They got jabbed their grooming in a way so we have like a dynasty. That's what the Kennedy's had in mind They wanted two terms for JFK two terms for Bobby and two for Teddy And the same but a bush is they had only one for our pop a bush because they'd work out too well in the second one Read my lips. I'm a lamp you know that all that stuff not to good got his ass want by Bubba So then we got Dota in there. Well by hooker by crook and I we got you have like I said waiting in a ways then there's always George P you know What the I'm sure they're grooming him. Oh, I'm positive. They are I mean you can't sit out there doing wheelies in a parking lot all day outside his girlfriends Thing you can't do that forever Sooner later is gonna butcher up a little bit plus you should look pretty good George P Maybe we could take over everything we should play nothing but ice is maybe after we take over everything We should play nothing but fox news it says after a couple of six fox news that be sobering I still would vote for bush in their first lesson and they'll write him in the bush mice doing a rack Oh, it's bush good you heard them saying bush good. I think it said butch not bush In other words, they're trying to say no matter how many years. Butch were very butch We don't fight like it, but Somebody says he ho and that's the list. It was a favorite of George Herbert Walker bush that was his favorite show. He ho Yeah, that's true That's right up his alley the great intellectual that he was While his friends at the Carlisle group were doing business with the bin Laden. He was busy at home washing he ho on TV With a mother of our country Barbara What's your name Betsy right Betsy Ross right Betsy Ross right no Martha Washington And that who he was married to bush a senior With a way here the she and she and the epitome of a spit image of Martha Washington God almighty Barbara bush Barbara we're a little bit of a We still have that in there. I wonder oh, I would love if we had in there Or she does that thing with a burping. Oh, I hope we do somewhere. You think that not in there. I'll find it Here's a fact from merchant and cruel spring says and I'll only be part of it Retreat cuz only for our show not only is this administration an essential command Seaming the overjoyed and gleeful at the body count They continue to pepper the media in the lame lambs where the citizens of this country with their own version of glorified details of war Maming destruction violence and bloodshed They're overjoyed attitude to killing so many countless of thousands Perhaps the single worst display of propaganda since the days of Nazi Germany when they gleefully published debt tolls And how many Russians were killed on the front how many innocence burned in their ovens and how many citizens were happily cheering on Hitler as he walked on the streets During the war this rep or answerable display of Nazi era stop propaganda only goes further to solidify and show the world That we are arrogant self-righteous self-serving and uncaring it also showing is firmly that the current American president Perhaps the worst single president not only in modern times, but this re of this nation That's what Alan Thomas said and she's been around a week a hundred years or so While people set people suffer back home this American president spending over three hundred billion dollars to fight this war and watch countless Di including his own who we sent over to this backward land all the name of God what is just and what is right? This is a sick and completely demented strategy plain and simple this administration must go and go on the 2004 general election before the American people continue to suffer while their children cry at a hunger and vain and Richard and Carl Springs You are He's always good.

By the way, for all of us, the final city is there who were so impressed by the selected vision, vision they saw on our TV say yesterday, these selected images because they don't have a brain of can't think for themselves. The red cross is things aren't really worth celebrating about. While Network Show is Jubilets Iraqi, the red cross is the situation is unacceptable, as what they said. That's their word unacceptable. While Networks around the world are showing pictures of Jubilets Iraqi, they'll be in areas that have suffered most under his regime, including the very poor Sodom city and the Kurds of the North. The international red cross is the situation downtown Baghdad is another story. In a full interview from the Center of Baghdad, where cross representatives said the situation is very hostile and that the American forces are shooting in anything that moves including one of their own convoys. At the time of this filing, the IRC of an unable to evacuate one of their seriously injured colleagues which may prove fatal. The streets are scattered with casualties and US soldiers are firing at anyone that tries to evacuate them. The IRC said they are shooting at the clearly marked vehicles and preventing treatment of the wounded is not only against the Geneva Convention but is unacceptable. Preventing treatment of the wounded is not only against the Geneva Convention but unacceptable. The situation in the city is extremely critical. Hospitals are reported to be overwhelmed by the inflow of war wounded patients in summer without water or power. The water supply for Baghdad is becoming an issue of major concern, following reports that the Cannot Raw Water Pumping Station in the northern part of the city has also stopped functioning. When they don't let any of the facts confuse you, okay? Because these people were just in a way. They were collateral damage and that's what it took for us to go to freedom. Sustl bit on the news about light fighting but whatever is going on with that bridge, I don't know if that was now or some other point. When every flasher says weapons of mass destruction will be found and if they can't find them, we'll make them sure we can't conjure some up. Light fighting my ass. In addition to which don't you remember when we had him cornered what was supposed to happen was going to use chemical and biological weapons against their troops? Did that happen? There's one of the best stories that I had you put on a website today is one about the possible deal that was made with the Russians, right? That he could with the Russian embassy? What about how is that story? It's only a four hour show. It's in here summer. You got it? Take and carry it. Come on, Spores of Warba Bob Herbert, Cheney links to a bit under attack. Don't you think it's a great deal? I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal. I think it's a great deal with Iraqi leaders, where who's saying what surrender bagged that without resistance and returned from being exiled to a safe country. Al Jazeera says that Lebanese television reported that who's saying is in the safety of the Russian embassy. Huh. You believe whatever you want to believe. It's a possibility. Of course. Of course the fact that they dropped those four bombs as gigantic 2,000 pound bombs on that compound, where he and his sons supposedly were. And they have money. Traces in. They have families there. They found some bodies. Not him. And of course we don't have his DNA anyway. But I guess even the little kids there didn't that they pulled out of the rubble didn't look like him. Like the clowns saw them. They just couldn't pass as a double or triple. Just mention that in passing. Okay. For those of you got all the answers. Those of you who are a bunch of lemons for this government for these corrupt lunatics. And now it's on the Syria. And that'll be on to Iran. And we're going to liberate air. Every one of the oppressed peoples of the world except of course our own. And we're going to be a little bit more depressed. Flesh who says we'll still not sit on the status of the Iraqi regime. What what the was that mean? It's agenda. Another area of the agenda. I see. 560, 505, 60, pound 560 on the AT&T line QAM. Hello. How are you doing now? Okay sir. They put it a little good news there. Those two asshole that were killed the deputy. They committed suicide. That's shot to be SL guy. Yeah. They saw them in a back of a G person. Excellent. That's the best news I've had all the way. They ran a hole and then did themselves and we'll call him my wife. Good. Hey. You're no longer a lot of people. I beg your pardon. You no longer allowed to play the Fox News had a bit. Sure we are. Okay. Would you play that for me? Absolutely. Okay. And a little good news there. The Fox News says not that's certainly ought to be in here. I shouldn't have to go through this thing with a disc. A disc. Huh? It's not in there. The call is in there. Ah. I'll have to find it out here. I'll tell you something. When he comes back, you better straighten his ass out. Here we mean. It's not in there. Don't be looking. Okay. Because that's. Kick his ass. Okay. One of the few people that have shorted it. Tell him we had a damn good week to sweep the audience. Seems to be pretty happy. He did then there won that pull yesterday about whose voice they hear to just fold me at the mic. Of course. Next time he does the show. Why do you work on Neil? What's written behind your back?

We're sports-reneal-564. You a-M. PAPAPIS-MIA. Fox News coverage of the liberation of Iraq continues at a moment with the latest surrender Tellies. The phenomenal battle successes of the last 24 hours. At a special Fox News segment on the genius of President Bush. Is he everybody's hero? Or is Saint? Saint from heaven above. Live coverage on CNN 24 hours a day is the war justified. We'll show you video of thousands of protesters yelling at each other than back to the battlefield where US led troops are meeting stiff resistance from egg throwing Iraqi citizens. Hello, Chris Matthews MSNBC. I'm in the way of yelling, but our reporters in Iraq share heart-wrenching stories. I'm American heroism through green screen night vision cameras. And then we'll take you back to the states to meet their families in heavily-ended segments. Pre-drink dramatic music that will bring you to the menless man to convulsant tears. Why am I yelling? I don't know! Only on our visit, I'll give you a point to truth about the wall at Iraq. Tonight we show you the merciless bloody murder of millions of innocent alaps by evil US forces. As they visper, we try to raise that heroist your toide of failing leadership. It's 14 to 1, one thing we're all agree on is we missed Iraqi information minister badly. He was a real hoot. He was like our chuckle of the day. Sometimes twice a day. We need to get him to show. He was really, in fact, maybe that would be good. Maybe the shooting control must be a series of clips compiled on Aaron Iraqi TV. Here's the bullshit that you were hearing about the Americans are all gone and out here. Just look around you. He's gone. Hold ass, baby. Just like I said yesterday, like Tom Don't Like is left in the middle of the night with a suitcase full of cash. Only Tom didn't have no cash. Just that stupid leather jacket. Here you go. I talked about this before about Michael Nikolan's rich in Powell. Son of our secretary of state. The nation's top medioreculated war in broadcast is this week that the FCC will take extreme action, including revoking broadcast licenses for egregious violations of the commissions in decency rules, which means to make a long story short you won't be hearing George again. While our C.C. Chairman Michael Powell has been one of the most vocal advocates against government intervention in free speech. He told the National Association of Broadcasters that there were limits to his patience. Although Powell expresses longstanding concern about government intervention in free speech, saying he gets queasy when the government is the editor, he says the commission would use its full power and extreme cases. Our rules run to the license C. Paul said when asked about the commission's willingness to go to the mad over in decency at some point enough is enough. Last week, the commission announced its intent to levier $27,500 fine for a decency against the infinity broadcasting operation in WKRKFM and Detroit. And more in broadcasters that future in decency violations put their license at their risk, you didn't believe me when I was telling this before. He had little faith. In its notice of apparent liability, the FCC said a WKRK broadcast between 430 and 5PM January 9th of 2002 included explicit and graphic sexual and extueterior references during separate discussions with 9 individuals. Here what I said with AI individuals. According to materials gathered by the FCC, the discussion of the Dementki and Dural show, including talk of breast size, masturbation, defecation and anal and oral sex. Ainal and oral sex. I just mentioned that in passing. Okay. He listened to Georgian or Carolina. While Paul wouldn't directly discuss the WKRKFM, he said he felt comfortable with the commission's decision and nothing commission has the power to pull a station's license. This will never be an easy question. He said only under the most egregious, willful repeated flouting at law will justify that penalty. But on the other hand, Revocation is an option to law. Paul challenged the idea that Commissioner Michael cops is pushing that media consolidation is aiding in a betting and cursing the media. Actually, it's the hyper-competitiveness that's causing the oil right. And there's a water crime kind in the sort of golden oligopoly. The public interest could be a little more than what interests the public. You could have an opportunity to serve vegetables with dessert. But in the modern media age, with changing morals and different media outlets has pushed broadcasters closer to the line. What I find today is it's so hyper-competitive that if you run the ear and you're not going to do the things that draw the interest of the guy next door they will, he said, as soon as they do you're in a competitive struggle with those people. In an interview with reporters after Paul's comments, cops challenged the chairman of examin the issue, I think that's certainly worthy of attention and analization cops said equally worthy of attention to Allen analysis is there a relationship between the rising tide of media consolidation and the rising tide of indescribings on the earways. I don't know the answer the first question. I don't know the answer the second question. I don't look forward to voting with answering those questions, but that's what we're doing. So there is the debate again, the battle. The lines have been drawn in the sand and don't mention your gland, okay? Because Michael Paul is getting pissed off and fired up. And I bet you John asked, off the sand. You go, boy. You're in tead. Egg in the lawn. The pleasure place. You ain't seen nothing yet, man. I'm telling you. Not just Patriot Act 2, Patriot Act 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, Patriot Act 4, ever. That's right. In fact, I think you're going to be a whole bunch of Patriot Act. Fuck, third of me! That's right. You mark my words. And all I can say about that is, let's go Patriot. What's wrong with that? Let's go Tommy Brady. Maybe he's still looking good to me. Boy, they're good. They're going to kick some dolphin. I can't wait till football season. I'm serious. I mean, he's standing up playoff. Oh, the stress from that second period last night. No, it's all the hockey calls we had today. None. None. So typical of this town of this station of this crowd, just said, Islanders upset Ottawa right there. We're not going to first game through nothing. Is they're choking gagging sounds from Jacques Martagne. And that crowd start coming out with you through the set. Could it be right through the TV set? All those froggy croaking sounds. Bruins are good. Remember the Bruins fan of Carl Fude's ago? What do you think of my team? What I tell him? Forst rate, baby. Got no chance. No, I'd like to see them upset jersey because I hate New Jersey. They make me ill. And Dallas, Edmonton, Beach Dallas. Every day in me or when Edmonton makes it, they play Dallas. So let's kick their rest again. Looks good to me. Two one last night. I was gone, boys. What are you nine in your head about? You did how many minutes of those games last night did you watch? About thirty minutes. You know, watch thirty seconds. No. Well, the high. Why? The highlights count. You saw the highlights? Yeah. You see Alexander McGillney in his three goals is Hat Trick? No. Asshole. Got a bit of yellow highlights. 1251 at 5.60. WQM. I'm surrounded by Lemmingsman Lemmings. This guy all he knows is, you know, Beans. That's all he wants. Bean counter. Which is a good thing you're out here. Because believe me, that's what's in the envelope. Beans. But clearance came or shut that door. I thought I smelled it. A little residue. We got to the mad dog coming up from the masters where it's rained out today. But I tell you, they should be timing on this was magnificent. But he's having a good time. That's all we care about. We love the mad dog. He's having a good time. And wait till he hears about Mo. I want to correction on the Mo Howard David Show to Mar about that crack of our Jews can't be a belong to Augusta. I think that's uh, he'd better do a retraction on that. Don't you think? If it's not true, he'd better. It sounds really inflammatory to me. It sounds anti-Somantic to me. Come on on here and talk it a bunch of crap. So either as that's what he was referring to as he didn't say that specifically. Either that or they have a list and he and Goldie and Robert Creeper on list. Which we could easily understand. 1252 a QM Lemmings say happy anniversary for the umpteen time.

I already have a homosexual relationship with Neil, so I might as well have one with you too. Yes, somebody submitted he-he-he's on her. It's already going to be a least-or-world. Thank you. He exploded to dominate people, kill with the gas that we sold him. First time a grester nation and the only one that's going, now more blood will be spilled to get that oil going, forget about Korean. The nooks they're toasted at the right wing is really good over and over and too are it. Yeah, daddy rag, asshole. Memphis of Memphis, Russia. Let's go and we're getting lucky. 3000 people killed. Our now forgotten, let's exploit him instead. Eight, there's oil to be caught in going after Saddam to play Kato's summer. There's no longer mention of the name in lotters, but no it's safe concerned of the inflases. Believe in every word of this cartel is in a station. I control this my fear through me and the manipulation and the right wing is really good over and over and too are it. You're that I rag, asshole. Weapons of Memphis, corruption. The loss of civil rights is done. Right that we're paying. We're all suspects now, not the ice drop is seen. I have nothing to hide. Table partners all are safe. I know BD and Kato don't have any reservations. Out of provoked fatta lents. World of the Niles, he's just an old regime's must-mall. It's haliburgin and so. With no objection at all. Timmer, crap don't have the palm and the right wing is really good over and over and too are. The rain was piz. I rag, asshole. Memphis, the fastest ruck-shun. Oh we're fine. Only a rag, asshole. Memphis, the fastest ruck-shun. The BD-5, 60, WQAM here's a ritual of the facts. Who says when I watch the news, he's a murderous rich stances. It makes me sick that he's not in the air and not in prison. By the way, is that guy still dead? I can't help but think what the family of that poor man that Rick ran over in Kailmusfield when they see a smoking face on Agile TV giving his righteous opinion of freedom. P.S. the show and the aloof this. The show does seem better with George Not there. When he returns, I hope he concentrates on producing and not being your laugh track. Remember the bird? Stay healthy, says Chris. Excellent boys, Chris. The first thing we're going to have to do is like a really clean out this studio. Not that the 360. Not that stuff because George W. He fills in has the habit of like, you know what I'm talking about. George is conceptive to do it in the show is to see how much he can get away with. How many bleeped wars he can strut? You know, that keep her in the tongue that when I would nickers. Okay, there's no such thing as shock radio anymore. It's all been tried. It's all been done. People have heard all the bleepes all the words. That's not what's entertaining anymore. It's juvenile. Of course, George V. In a big desperate to get laid. That's basically where his life is coming from. That's his whole focus online. So maybe we ought to send him out to a focus group. And leave him there. I'll be back next week. Well, he thinks he's coming back. I'll be back in town next week. I'm not sure why. And say we back work in next week. Anyway, 500 and some odd votes. Neo Rodgers show 98 which we're going to be starting in Baghdad next Monday. South Park movie 81 Jerry Spinger. Although his show will be heavily edited. I will turn to that. Know how they keep saying they headed like the Iraqi government was editing the reports. Well, it's going to be the same way we have the Neo Rodgers show in the bag. It's going to be like that. Like that. Kind of like that. Anyway, we got the mad dog from Augusta. Next week, I want to have a real exciting show when I ran out out there. And he's probably pouring it inside. And then we got Hank the Humper III. Well, I'm sure he's waiting right outside the door to discuss hockey in Ocena CarPlayhouse with me. Bye bye. I'm going to watch the show on the ice. Oh, honey. Howard David's a bitch. Yes!
