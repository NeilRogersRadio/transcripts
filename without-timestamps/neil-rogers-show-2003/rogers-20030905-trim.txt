Neil. You gave away 500 tickets? Yeah, and 500 people total were at that game. It was a ghost town in Fuderal House. It was a freaking morgue. It was a miles away. I'm 213. My ass. Everything you need to know of. You finally taken the South Florida cure of your girl. I finally eaten Dutch soup. There was 500 people there yesterday. There was 10,000 off below every one of them. Right? There's no way. There's a line in the door. There is a third spy under me. By the way, he wasn't even the game. My train sent me butterflies or somebody had a kid. I was seeing a guy. I don't speak into the beast to care about how come the beast is doing live spots on your show. High priced talent like you who can't even afford a car. How come the beast is doing live spots? I'm, I can afford a car. I just won't pay for one. I'm getting, I got a car deal supposedly. I believe it when I see it. And then he said, I'm getting him real estate. I have to charge him five bucks to do a live read. That's seriously. What kind of crap is that? You're only offered two hours. You have little bit of veil. And this little tub of crap that you're on a virgin blowing out of there anyways. Doing live spots. Yeah, I'm going to bring that up to Greg Reed in my next meeting with him. Yeah. This is a very valid point. Why am I letting the beast use my hand? No. No. No. Yeah, you're as hard as how he did it. He does a good on your show when we asked him to do it. Yes, did I? My show. Yeah, like he wasn't getting paid. I got someone in my mouth or something. Yeah, I'm sure you did. That's what clearance came. You're marble boy. So yeah, it was offered. Terrence was offered two jobs. You were that? No. No. One in Tennessee. One in Kentucky is PD. He said he prefers KY. We got two holes today. We took an early poll to see if who should be fired at the station. Yeah. Who is named? I got on top of the list. Oh, no. This is the best. I love eating nuts. What would you say? I do. Are you getting defensive already? No, I'm fine. What your name just happened to be at the top of the list for all's trying to get your bone out. I think that you know, everything you say about, at least for all Howard. What a push coming. Hey, listen. I'm looking at the Sunset and the website yesterday. They have to know. Oh, dolphin game won't be blacked out. They finally sold out. I mean, what are we talking about? This is a town, especially in the summertime and all the way till December. Forget about summer. All the way through the fall. There's nobody there. They can't support anything. If you gave him like a gigantic jackstrap, they couldn't support it. I went to a, I didn't realize the last time for the first profile game. And there was, I think, three guys you had. Royce last night. I wish I did. Yeah. Hey, now. I love getting rid of one of the beast long enough. You'll have Royce. Those things are like, those are like, parasites. Those hemorrhoids. You know, Roy Foster, Roy, who used to be Roy, who used to work in ourselves to bring in the bleeding oozing hemorrhoids. Oh, right. Did you know that? No, but I did not. I mean, from that big strap on that, he used to borrow all the time. Oh, I saw that thing that he was blacked around. I think was dangerous. God, I bet you, you know, I won't even say what I think. You didn't. And it touched that thing. Did your coscran's been on it and you were in and around it? Ah! Just thinking about that makes me go e-tony romance. Oh, 10,000, two, 13. And you were a puppet at listen, even I, even I, who don't give a crap about baseball anymore. Even I was like, push and come on. Listen, go out there and support the team. They're like, uh, tied for the wild Carly. Nobody shows him right in our deal. They can't play muscle. I was in right field. And I yell, hey, batter swing. And you could hear me at home play. I'm sure of it. It's in better. I should hear you on the air. I was listening to the game. I said, that's for real. It was embarrassing, dude. Wow, what are we going to do about this? I'm just going to go and I'll go to O'Leo later night. And you wonder why the hell I don't want to be there? You wonder why I stay out of there. I know now. I don't know. I only bad news. The only bad news is my phone rang. Well, I wasn't here. I think I was. But I came back last night and it was a voicemail on my phone. Guess it was from Roy. It was from the, hey, right. The stalker, Jeff Rimmer, your close personal friend, Jeff Rimmer. No, he's just, no. I don't have any year words. It was the now or so. And then I don't question authority anymore. You're right about everything. I'm just going to go back to a bug a tea game, jump in the pool. Good luck to you. That's fine. Have a great weekend, Scott. You too. It's Friday, you pasted. He didn't ready old. On totally in control. Would lies in his inn. The nation. You're, they don't want you to know about the globalist assholes. Right from the whole nation. The economy took a crack. Getting slaughtered in Iraq. I'm a push to pay the trade-ups. Call the people that want to know this only one way to go. You gotta retain it. New papers, but... You know what? You can't talk to a little bit. Yeah. I know, but they just want to be in front of us TV. Think they would happen to them. They're going to be happening to me. You know what? But it cares about you, yeah. They're, yeah. O'Leah, it's New Leah. Yeah. And they say, what is you saying? But they wouldn't have gone up a media alleyway. No father, they would do much information. I don't want to leave it. I don't want to believe it. So can do things like that? I've taken it very bad. It's the best in this challenge. But if all this view and Fox News, they don't lie. No. But it cares about you. It's a way to have a bad ass. Everything's just bad. So one of two people down, I can't be said to share with that. I've been making things out by ass. I don't say anything to one of you. Don't think they look a cellophobia. As you go, all of the was gone. Oh, yeah. 10,000, 2013, a tomorrow game is to have to know. A tie for the wild car lead. They're now 12 games over 500. They're a hottest epistole. They're doing all of this without my low now. Last few days. And nobody cares. That's why I played that right off the bat. Nobody gives a crap about anything. No, Mo. Right. What? Exactly. That's my point. See even George, you don't care. Hey, let's get to this first pool. So I have to give yesterday's pool results real quick. Let's dispense what that guy in six. Here's the Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Fort Lauderdale. Come on. Let's do it. Yeah. Yeah.

Timothy Dalton 4 Ben Stiller 4 Denzel Washington 3. Donald Southern only had two because they thought it was very steady when he went. Like that. Anthony Hopkins 2 and Sean Connery had two. So that's it. That was pretty good. I like that pool. I want to take in two polls today. First of quick. This hour. If you could get one person fired at WQM. Who would it be? And here's the list we got so far. Now maybe we are by the way. The path has got another stiff Jonas Hogan unloaded by Lisa. A's a stiff. So they got an old ex-late Todd Gill Todd Miller. Listen to Todd Drek. And Jonas Hogan is going to be a long season panterfans. Jonas Jonny Hogan boy. She suck or what? If you could get one person fired at WQM. Who would it be? Here's our list so far. The beast, George, Neil, low Howard David. Absolutely. Pral. Geldy, Greg Reed, Hank Goldberg, the Humper. A Joe Kaustella, Mark Eisenberg, Orlando Elzacuiri, and Jimandage. We left off Ed Kamplin because I just I don't have the heart to put him on here. Because there's no way he ought to get fired. I mean, no way any of these people should get fired. I'm not thinking to people get in the fire just because somebody feels like it. And the reason I'm taking this preliminary poll is because for us to be fired bad, we already got blown off of the Mohara Davided show. We're not fired just off that show. He wants him reassigned. Right. But that's no fun. I mean, no seriously. Can you imagine doing a poll? Who would cover your Q and F to be a sign? I mean, what are we talking about? That's not the South Florida F and White. Oh, that would be a. The South Florida F away is fire your ass. You should be fired, Neil. You should retire and George you. You're so, you know, bro. But you're unfriendly nasty, miserable, hateful rotten bastards. Just what you got in South Florida, which is why nobody can show up for anything. Ball games. That's why they almost had a blackout. Could you imagine the opening a whole moment of the dolphins, you don't think it's a girls team. Blackout? Could you imagine that how embarrassing that would be? No. So they had to go right down to the wire to sell the last tickets so they could lift a blackout. And they declared a sellout. And the Marlins 10,000, 213 and like Scott said, They were like maybe, you know, maybe a couple of thousand people. There's nobody there. Nobody there. They're red hot. They're on fire. They're like the shock of the sports world. At least in baseball and nobody cares. Nobody's there. So why the hell's your media all been out of shape? Nothing we could do in the best we can. About what? About life in general. So let's get that new pull up there. Eric, let's, well keep this one on at 11, 11, 30. Now we got that second pull, which is similar. Is, you notice the similarity there? I did, but it's much broader, much broader scope. And more fun. Hey listen, when you got up this morning and took a deep breath. What were you breathing?

It is like, yeah, just like when he tried to get your ass fired. You know, you say, so it's brutal. You start playing with people's live. Right. Cruel. Cruel. I'm not just disgusting. I'm acceptable. So let's add that on there. Don't fire nobody. Here's a call from moral geables. I'm going to fire you. Oh, retire. You're a cast, retire. I'm going to fire you. I'm going to fire you.

So there's three out of three assholes. We're batten a thousand. Even Thai Cobb couldn't do that. Even baby Ruth couldn't bat a thousand. It's going to be asshole Friday. You know what? We're prepared for it. I'm delighted. I'm ecstatic. At least there's a pulse. You know what I'm saying? Tom Jickus says I can't. Oh, by the way, what year? How many years since Tom Jick erot a column in a sunset? I'm good man. Yeah. The last column on a website July 29. This last time I checked is the fifth of September. So we kind of missed a month in there. And that's on the heels of his big whining and dining out in LA with all the big Hollywood TV moguls. You know? But I'm going to want to suppose to be out of touch. Touch this, Tom. You little jackass. You little squirt. Maybe he died or something. I think he died? I don't know. Right. And some are I don't know. We don't wish he would die. I mean, maybe like have die is hair. That would be good if he had any. 3 to 5 this afternoon. The lovely Miguel who's got plenty here.

We had 19,400 as of the start of the show yesterday. And we're just not getting no information. If Doreen would keep her goddamn hands off of his ass. Maybe he'd have some time to really get involved in this thing heavy duty. And all of a sudden. But she is back there like grabbing his ass and try to, you know, squeeze his privates and stick it or tongue down his throat. That sounds like sexual harassment to me, don't it? Okay. Damn bitch. And my Greg and sunrise says, hi, Neil. I'm a fellow D NH devotee. Do know harm. Thank you. God bless you. Thanks for coming. I think about the beast being way too visible on a for real show. I send an email to the deaf inform. Now I started to tune out whenever the beast interrupts and talks over Scott. Finally, can you imagine the rain station when everything had Scott and managed to do the off against? I seriously. I said yesterday that for real ought to be doing the Marlin games with boog. Right. And I'm serious about that would be great as the colored guy. He could be the colored guy. It says it would be outrageous. Scott and Mandage. Could you please play a Mandage yell and Scott screaming. Woo. Greg and sunrise has worked up at a with frenzy. Mohour David's leading the early returns and if one person was fired a QAM who should it be. We got 28 votes. Come on, you can hop on there.

One for Mandage, one for George, one for me, one for Scott, one for Greg Reed, one for the Humper and an out some. Look at that most up to 20 votes. I think he's a weiner.

Yeah, what can you do for it? Say something. New. If you come to me man, I'd have fire Howard, but since you said to take it easy on Howard, I'd say I give him a three, M, to three, 50 and show and have him get a sideline reporter for a middle school. Yeah, I'll ride. I'm ride. You got his number, George? Oh yeah, sounds like he's got the good craft. Okay, now we're getting going on a start way. No, more Howard David, it leading of course. What is your pot? What a concept? George and I both voted for Mo. Mo's got 26 votes. I saw where there was only two votes on there and to begin with, both hours. The beast eight, don't fire nobody's seven. We like those seven people. They want they, they appreciate the fact that we need to eat. Okay. George five, Greg weed five, Neil three, fire Neil. For all three. Two for guilty. Orlando, Elsa queries got two Jim. Man, this has got a pair of body. The people are really surly because Mad Dog never gets any negative to revotes. You know what?

Who is the guy? He's just terrible on the air. Here's Pompano, hello. Hey, no. Yes, sir. There are a couple of things for you. I George should be fired. Yeah. And I got a question for you. You said 50 TV is really good. Yeah. I went on on line now that I checked out 50 TV. There's American broadcasting. No, it's not. I'm not talking about any of the network American Network shows they carry. Why do you have no idea what you're talking about? You idiot. You parochial in bacill. People went on line. Yeah, what does that mean? You watch in city TV online? No. No. Here's the guy that he's he's critiquing for me. It's television in Toronto because he's looking at some crap online. Listing of networks shows that they might carry. What does that have to do with anything? What do price of peanuts? Anything? No, nothing. There's one of your people. I mean, what do you're a negative. Yeah, it goes to show you. The people that hate George generally speak and don't know Schmidt. I'll know some of them are pretty like the abulin guy. Now, the C.H.H.T. is that why you got so bad out of shape? There's no he's a chronic. He never had anything to say. Well, that's fine. Listen, are we going to be picky? See you. You should come out now understand. Am I that stupid? I'm going to be picky. Now we talk. We talked about eight people already this morning. Listen.

Well, hint to. And he's here, at least the abulin guy ain't here. But Rimmer is here. And I'm serious. I'm not answering my phone this weekend. If anybody I know calls me, I don't worry that I died, although I might. But it's just that I'm not answering the phone. I don't want to be bugged by Rimmer. There's state at the most expensive hotel in the city here, according to his voice mail last night. I think I'm going to show up if I'm gagging on it. See, I just died. Okay, I'll call me Rimmer. I died. So you can probably afford his own meals. No, you know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I'm damn it. Stocking me. And Amsterdam, there they are. Hint to rot. Over to getting gagging on them. The stalkers. And you know what? My phone is ringing right now. My phone in the other room is ringing right now. That's the best I love. Go for it. It rang once. Oh, that was the best. Oh, God. I know who that was to probably some pervert. Anyway, more how we David a 34 don't fire nobody 12. That was great. The Beast 9 towards 7. Greg Reid 6. The Maddoz got 4 and guilty for it.

I'm going to say when I'm just going to talk to you with Goldberg. You got to try and every pump stays in the realm. And then I know what the chatroom's on with you. But they go home and have the oil in the oil fields. Oh, can't you see this city here? I got my back against the film machine. Huh? This is the worst in the sea. I used to play one of the tea. Oh, what the hell they've dropped? Can't break the sound, Joe. They have dropped. Can't break the sound, Joe. Oh, yeah. Thank you Mr. President for those little cast prices. Those record high cance prices amongst 75 average. Unloaded crap. By the way, US also lost 93,000 jobs in August this evening. What they lose them? On the non-form. Well, seriously, it's 93,000 non-form jobs lost in August. Just when they're peddling in some bunch of crap about, oh, they caught him he's turning around and it's great because they certainly can't talk about foreign affairs now. So now all of a sudden he's started talking about the economy like he's putting all the pieces back together. Is he doing it? No, of course not. If you could get one person fired at WQA, I'm who wouldn't be wearing scone the arches of talk. A little preliminary pull today. Beast is doing pretty well. More Howard David at 46 don't fire nobody, 21. The beast 11. George 9.

And even though this is one where you don't want to have a lot of votes, if you don't have any votes it's like you're being ignored, nobody has any ID who you are. Right, like you're not important enough for a vote. And this says Naples on 9, but always dubious. Here's Naples, hello. Yeah. He's over in Naples allegedly, but he's listening to a boring show. Take your asshole. Boy, you guys, he's a little bit too far south of the blown away that tropical wave. Just wait. Mickey's going to be in the Atlantic. Here's Miami, hello. Yes sir. Have you seen Jerry Lewis's head? Is this Woody? Yes. You know something? Well, I don't know what this is going to shock you, but when I pressed that button I thought it was Woody. I don't know. I'm not joking either. I knew it was him. I mean, would he call us on a day like this? Yeah. He would. It's asshole Friday and this goes to show you only the losers stay in town. The other people on the left to stay there for their jobs, et cetera. Well, that's another story, but the loser stay there at this time of the year. When it's 400 degrees in the shade, you've got all these tropical storms and hurricanes and tropical waves and all of this other crap. And about 40 people doing the wave at a baseball game, which went out with the knickers. Look at this. Cato Valley Arkansas, man charged with wearing a Skippy swimsuit. A man's Skippy swimsuit was too much or too little for Taco Bell workers in Arkansas, and plays a Taco Bell called Polis Sunday. When the man walked into the restaurant wearing only a tiny black spito swimsuit in the cutoff T-shirt during the Labor Day weekend. Cato Valley police chief Hiram Latin said his attire or lack thereof was a little too revealing. He was just hanging out there. He was inappropriately dressed for a restaurant said Latin he said the man had left his clothes at a lake. The man faces a seven hundred fifty dollar fine possible jail time if convicted of indecent exposure. According to Arkansas law, personally charged with indecent exposure, he knows his conduct is likely to cause a front or alarm. Police took it to the man and took photos of him in the spito for use in court. Can't wait to see those. He was just like, hanging out at Taco Bell. The man was just like, you know, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're a little bit like, you're like, you're very like this, you're because what you're all like, youras, what you're, your asude, your asude That the subject is being aired so publicly because it was very no-escripted out of the carpets at Francis Finningan, a historian whose pioneering research on the maged the lean laundries in Spiderman, and estimated 30,000 women twirled in nine such A pediatentiaries in the early 19th century until 1996 when the last of the laundries shut down in Dublin. The last woman taken to the facilities entered 15 years before that. Oh my god, says the system began as it means a rehabilitating prostitutes but quickly expanded to become a dumping graph ready woman deemed to have committed a sexual wrong from giving birth out of wedlock to flirting.

How about saving a little bit of it for a noose job sweetheart? Why do you wear shoes? Welcome to Who wants to be California's next governor, I'm your host, Regis, and here are today's contestants. Superstar of the Silver Screen, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Superstar Child Eta, Gary Colman. And finally Superstar of the porn industry, Larry Flynn. Welcome to You All. Now, let's play Who wants to be California's next governor? Here's your first question, hands on those buses, and good luck. Question number one, what's his capital of California? Arnold thought would be cold and hay again. Oh sorry. Larry, then only is it the capital of California, but it's the porn capital of the world. What's the answer? Oh, hi, no. Gary. How should I know, fool? Well, you buzz in. What you talking about Regis? Well, let's move on to Question 2. Dylan, spell, California. Gary. What? Well, you buzzed in again. Huh? I just went to my probation opportunity yesterday, and I'm clean. I ain't buzzing on nothing. Arnold, T-E-R-M-I-N-A-T-O-R. You just stand terminator. Correct. And it's now playing at a theatre near you. Where are you? C-A-L-D-I-F-O-R-N-I. You're almost home. C-A-T-D. Well, I, you just spelled California. I'm like a governor. That's what we're changing the name too. Well, alright, Chris, number three. Hands on the busers, and good luck. According to the bus recently adopted California text code, what is the maximum amount of non-reported income that can be itemized on a Dendom phone 17D without incurring a penalty? Arnold, breed. I would like to use my phone a friend and call my wife Maria. I'm sorry, Arnold. You have no more phone a friend's left. B-M-A-M-A. You see, she handles the checkbook. Right. Taxes. Who pays taxes? If I'm elected, nobody should have the pay. Damn die! I'm free. Gary. Now, we just haven't worked as a security guard over at the Fresno Mall since 84. And this dude might create, when he's got to be paying me on the table. You know, but I promise if I'm elected governor, I'm making up money to know what the hell you're talking about. Ha ha, Coleman's getting paid under the table. Carful, you don't bump your head down there. Ha ha, now I know you just didn't make a joke about me being a short. What are you going to do about a little man? At least I don't sound like someone Australian kangaroo. I'm from Austria, you moronic midget. You know, if I wasn't so damn busy, proof-free in the September issue of us, but amazing, I did out of this wheelchair and said you're B-Fa! What you're talking about, Larry Smith? I would like to take both of you and twist you into school. Oh, no, get some of that shit. I will not take you to the office. I'm not going to be in the bus. How, what do you know? It looks like we're out of time. He should have joined us again for another exciting episode of Who wants to be the Governor of California? I'm Registrate, Ragnet, Orangeville, and Greenville, and Greenville, and Greenville. Lebanon, 4 or 5, 60, WQM, and happy Friday too. We've got the man dog at 2. The Humphority, Crystal Palacid, and Bahamas, and other brutal assignments. And if you think it's tough to show from the Bahamas, 4 to 6, 30, he's got the A of Lonstacks, you'll want to take from 5 to 6. So the Humphorage got a tough hour and a half assignment today. Marlins have that 6, 30, and a Marlins and the Expo's in San Juan Puerto Rico 705. Eddie Kifallos and baseball game ESPN made you overnight. That's our schedule. Here on QAM, you're highly touted and highly rated and we don't know why. Rick, facts as me and says. Stay away from Plasma TV's. There's a fire hazard. The Plasma heats up on the wall and creates this hazard. Sorry, I ball once is Rick. How do you like that? Not exactly what you call a real testimonial. No. You believe that? I'm sure. But if he says so, he knows his crappy Zendee. Why would he lie? He said the experience. Well, he wouldn't lie. Thanks, Rick. I guess although maybe if it heats up, I'll kill the rats in the walls. I'm a little bit concerned about that because the people of crispy critters came again down there the other day and they found three more dead rats in the, in the attic. So that's a total of eight. Eight. Eight crispy critters in the trance. Eight. And they're coming today to like seal off all of the entry points and exit points and in and out. All of that stuff. But in the meantime, it's not a very advertising thing. Of course you're used to what you got all kinds of rats in the shed. Yeah. That would be a good thing. That would be a good thing. Yeah. That you know about. No, you'd hear them like you like your experience there. Like I said, like I said, if they're in the walls, you'd hear them rassling around and you'd get really nervous and aggravated about that. And you start, you know, hallucinating all sorts of possibilities. And any attic, no, no, not like you're doing. See, that's just no. What they all they was? Last Sunday. Sunday night Monday morning, I wake up at 6.30 more. It sounded like there was a herd of elephants in my attic. It's now they weren't doing that. I thought we were alert. Yeah. Twipe the noisy. The Michael Jackson's house. Singing Ben. Even though I'm 39 votes on the first pool, finito. Okay, we're going to put the second one up there. Now should have something to get a sink your teeth into. It's up there. No, I know that. Would you have a better vote? I got one to add. Okay, just calm down. We have no ball of it today. We've got a full four hours. And this is a toughy, too, because you only have one. Let me say that again very clearly. We'll clearly. You only have one choice. If you could boot one person out of south Florida, who would it be? Four votes there. Just went up on the thing. We've only got five choices because it'll give you chance to add to it. Which I'm sure you'll be delighted to. OJ's got a pair and Colter's got one. Mohara David at one. Missed drugs don't have any and Jose Concecut. I don't have any yet, but they will. I'll get in the pack to the first pool 239 votes. If you could get one person fired at WQM, who would it be? Oh, I forgot I got a place fired by the Mohara David band. Oh, David singers. Yeah, the Mohara David and singers. You know what I'm talking about? Absolutely. Mohara David at Winds this pool hands down his pants to pick out Dingo Buries 84. 35% said fire his smelly old ass. And the rest of one baby. I think maybe he could get himself a new career as a pizza delivery man. Because he showed that a big bomb. Don't fire nobody 36. George 25 edges out to beast to add 22. Aren't you a little embarrassed about that? No. No, actually not really because your the beast is only on like doing updates and doing. Not that I thought doing a lot of June I'll cry. They're recognition thing. Right. Greg Reed 16. Neil 10. That's an ice even number. Neil's a perfect 10. And the asshole list I guess. Jim managed nine Orlando Elzagiri the big. Oh, god of nine. Henry Goldberg's got eight for the Humper. Yeldy seven for else got six. Mark Eisenberg for they once they got started with him. They started getting a little carried away. Ed Kaplan's got two and good old Joe Costello. I guess is the most popular guy in a radio station. Which is odd because he's on two to five in a morning or maybe just that nobody knows who Joe is. Who? Joe Mama. Joe Costello only one. And it's the most popular although nobody wants to hear his show. They're just if he was on like in the afternoon or like in a morning when Moes on you'd be amazed. It is number. I don't think so. He has that motor sports thing on Saturday morning. Is that still on? Let's check and look at that. Look at that. They moved Joe up to prime time. Now he's eight to nine a.m. He used to be on like in the wee hours like Moe when they were trying to shovel him off. And now we got the golf show. Would Mark would in Tim Rose the fourth. You have no idea who they are seven to wait and motorsport Saturday. Would Joe Costello and eight Joe Rose if he mick a suckies at nine. How do you like that? And Joe promises me because we got the big dolphin home opener coming up on Sunday. Home up. Then his whole show tomorrow morning he's going to be talking about our from Boca. Which I can't wait for that. I might actually come in here and take a listen or two. That thing with a phone ring and before that was that was sweet. That was just a beautiful thing. Okay. If you can just one person, what we got to add would get the list going. Seventeen votes. OJ's got five. That's why voted for was a tough choice. Because I'd like to get all five of these people out of that town. We'd prove things dramatically. And colder for Moe Howard David and four. Mr.udge's got a pair. And was they can suck those got one. Did they ever change the name of that street or not? I don't think I believe you. I don't know. They talked about it. Well Scott would now. Scott you knew there. That's a quick idea. That probation charge violation. No, that wasn't what I asked though. I know that. See if you're going to tell me things like today is Friday. It's not it's not really contributed to a very large way. But you know, I know that. My apologies. No, don't apologize. Don't be a pussy. Okay. You can do that on Moe show. But don't be a pussy on the show. Stand up for your rights. And you'll be gone next week. But, uh, seriously, they were still going to change it because they just decided he said to scumbag. I mean, guilty of innocent. They don't care. They just are embarrassed. I mean, they're much. A street with his name on it. There would be like having a Joe Girston way. In the only case you noticed, we don't have an embarrassment factor down here. Or yeah, like on Miami Beach, Arthur Godfrey is right. I mean, I still can't figure that out. It's hard time. We can't really have an avenue. You know and that one block over. What is wrong? There must be the O.H.S.C. To mother must be seen on that. I must be a the H.C. One of the most virulent anti-Semite to ever set foot anywhere in a state of Florida, God for you and on the beach where they got the air least in those days had nothing but Jews old Jews and they named a street after them They probably they probably get gas at the hiss gas station Here's for a lot of deal hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir Three times I have a suggestion for you pal, okay? Oh, and I turn it up to hear himself on here. Don't listen no mo. Okay They either have to get worried about this show with you and mo. Yeah, most big with a dark crowd 560 560 pound 560. See that was in the last hour catch up with the times okay pal First of all, don't be talking like that and don't name your kids and for me. We'll be a good idea Here's Palm City hello Palm City Long gone how about Western hello Western You haven't another phone fart there or something?

I can smell that talcum Was that helping you coming out the give it these flyers that he's cartoon little That and he put these big bright eyes on you to scare the hell out of you and Eventually once they see it what up you can have to go back up there about a month later to pick out the dead bodies Are you serious? Yeah, well, how that was that possible if they see what up where the hell are they gonna come in from? They're not really all weaving They might think that they're weaving or they trapped them all, but they're so many I had it two certain in the morning I was here packed for rats running into the house And running across my bedroom ceiling Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Hacker rats three months Huh, so the what the hell?

Here's a class from Bill and Ford Latterdale who still hates George like, but I don't see him put that image time. Oh brother, Johnny Depp is a back peddling pussy, right? Oh god. You know what Bill isn't asshole, you know it? He said Johnny Depp is God and he's got the balls and he's a good guy. Got the balls to, you know, tell it like it is about Bush and about what's wrong with America. Those are the people who are the true patriots, the people who want to point out the problems and to say, we got to fix these things as opposed to the blind idiotic flag waving idiots, the liemings, the sheep, the morons. But anyway Bill says, Plasma screens are only for those who have more money than they have since. They have a very short shelf life. Some is a little less three or four years after which they burn out, reggling the set completely useless. If you don't mind, Chuck, Sheldon, 10 to 30 grand every few years dead, they're quality of picture, then go right ahead. Be my guest. As far as I'm concerned, the high end HD sets are quite suitable for just about any broadcasts of the last many years. Thanks Bill and Fort Lauderdale, like I always said it good common sense.

We're trying to outside out of Murray. Boy, you talk about forcing yourself into a situation. Everybody wants her out, and she continues forcing her something. I'm not going to get rid of me. Now, when I'm this dark, it reminds me of somebody else. Yeah. Howard from Boca? Absolutely. David Baxes. David Baxes. David must be already gotten. Early started in a weekend. Must be doing heavy drugs because he says, thanks for your continual pulls. Even though it's meaningless, it's nice to be able to push your button. And in theory, kick Alex's penis out of Miami. He says, you missed the opportunity to put Mo on this one too. David? Looks to me like Mo is in third place at the Mo Mo 26. Both. I could be just hallucinating and imagining that. Now, Quincy in Miami, who lives in sunrise. He's in Miami being held captive. I'm sure because who that we wouldn't be there wrong. And, Terrible, if he lives in sunrise, Quincy says, just this one time, Mo will not win a pull. Well, guess what? Quincy, you are absolutely correct. So, is that really think I have you win a ride here? Miriam, Mary Ann Elephant, for whatever name is. P.S. Mo's still blows. No Mo Elephant, please go to California and see Arnold and says, That's an idealist chip in. I'll pay for the whole airfare in coach. 560560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. If you could boot one person out of South Florida, who would it be? And so far, OJ is winning hands down your pantaloonies, man. 70 votes. Nobody's even close. Here's a call in Miami, hello. Yeah, please. Uh-huh. Night, what? I'm just groaning. Why? Why do you take the, when you stop? What's what I'm telling? What's the time? What are you telling? Why do you do that? What do I groan? As soon as I punched up line nine, I knew it was him. So what are you getting so bent on a shape? I'm not a shape. I'm just groaning. And I'm just excited. I'm not asking Scott no more questions either. Okay. Well, no, he doesn't want to talk. Which is fine. That's a breath of fresh air. That's pleasant. He doesn't want to be on the air. We have some people around here like the beast. I want to talk too much who had nothing who are like an impediment to the success of the program that they're interfering with at the moment. And we got other people who want to be like major celebrities like the one you picked up off the floor that day. Who wanted to be a make the website into like all a beater boy all day long. You know, you're right. Here's beater boy. But for real, here he is on a cruise ship. Here he is. Tukin is guts out. Here he is at the baseball game. Here he is with some slot. Yeah. But we got a guy now who has who wants to say nothing. I was going to say who has nothing to say. Which is a possibility. But he wants to say nothing. And he seems like, you know, a guy. Yeah, he's got the job. He just wants a paycheck. Which we can all relate to that. Anything we have. If we have if we have something with sports related that I'll have. We'll have to be for it. Him since you know nothing. Anyway. But if we had anything else, we'll just leave him like him sit there and. And stew. 567. 560. 560. 560. 560 on the AT and T. And Verizon Wireless line. You think we'd have a lot more names on this just like yesterday. You would have thought. And then they finally got into it after about 20 or 30. Mentiones. They finally understand what it's all about. They're just a little flow. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Is gone. Nice talk to you Hollywood. That's your town. Here's Key West. Hello. Yes, sir. Meal. Yes. Gloria and Amelia are different. Oh, I like it. Let's pick her because he's a little bit. He did have a full with them every week. They will win and down. Okay. 5. Ask the key milled. 560. 660. 560 on the AT and T of Verizon line Monday. George is going to be on plane. Luis Miguel records all day. That's just a joke. If I say that, they'll take it. Sorry. Take it. You know. But that green of the wind. I will need to do it anyway. I don't know. I can't believe we're not getting any more calls about the rats. Can you imagine how many people in the audience have had rat problems? I like to know if anybody else has ever used crispy critter control. I mean, they're critter control. Because how he's been in a lot of money and he's used to me. Like, what? I use somebody else and don't spend a lot of money. Well, that's what I was going to do. But somebody in my house had to want to go pick an anybody. But somebody misunderstood my message and he called crispy critter control as opposed to calling our good friends at ATM alternative term management. Then the Steven, those people are so good. Right. But after my people, another short period of time. And if this problem doesn't come to a quick halt, then it'll be the old ATM. Well, buddy, but you're telling me that you got rats in your shed. Had any of them? Sure. And it was ATM that done it? Yeah. Well, I'll be damned. Because this crispy critter crowd, see, I don't know. But when somebody called me about them the first time, it was like, never back in April was the first time I heard her rat andong and scratching and we had these people come out and they found nothing. Right. But if they sound like they're like, like, like, proud animal could you know what I mean? Like an official county agency and they're not. They're just another business when they first started coming over to the house for other things. They asked us what our past problems were. And we mentioned it almost in passing. Well, rats sure like our shed. We just can't keep them out of there. We put traps. We put poison in there. And they took care of it. They said it's an ongoing meeting. I mean, these people came and asked me who my past were. I mentioned, remember, and I still can't get rid of it. Christ. I think they're the special. I mean, what is that all about? I'm an inch today. I'm thousands of miles away. Here come the rivers. I'm in Toronto. How many times have you been up here since the last few years? I've been doing the shows here. I'm third man. Oh, here. It's river. It's river. Go away. Okay. Don't take it personal unless you want to. We just go away. I'm going to tell Ken Halpern about you. God. Here's Miami Beach, hello. Yeah. Hi. Yes, sir. First of all, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good morning. Good morning. Shortes. Yeah. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yeah. No. No. I'm not sure. Get on here. You idiot. If you could boot one person out of Sapphola, who would it be? He says the shorts is. But you can't even know what they're like saying. It's either Jews or Dark folks he's talking about or maybe Dark folks name Schwarzenegger. But that's got Laura really offended about it. Yeah. Even Scott Jr. They're into happy about it. And he isn't even what the guy's talking about. But he hasn't even here. What does that mean? He had to go to New York. I'm sorry. Jersey. The New York area. Oh, he's already gone. So that's why Miguel is there. I thought Miguel was just filling the Moscow was taking a big dump or something. I didn't know what else going on. And here I'm talking about Miguel getting bone and de-reen every day. And he's sitting right there. Well, that's good. That's good. Maybe we'll get him off the hook for all time, sick. Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Yeah. How's it going, Neil? Pretty good, pal. Yeah. It's put on the game, Dad. That you're looking for. It's 14. 14. I'll piece of cake. Yeah. I'll get mad off.

I'm down there for a week. I'm playing with rats. And I come up here. And it's the weather is beautiful. And I'm happy as a pig and slap. And, you know, you open up the the Hershey Highway via the airwaves to soft floor. And it's like, you know, they're just keeping their unhappiness at everybody. Don't heap it at us. Don't be our fault. Not my responsibility or this, you're, It's fact not only that, but look at it this way. If it wasn't for this show, can you imagine these people probably blow their brains out already? Like the one guy said, the guy that's going back to Texas with a banjo on his ass. He said, he's right. This was the only connection to reality in amusement. He ever had a body was in South Florida. Here's a call from Boca, hello. Anyhow, how you doing? Pretty good. I had that all rat problem myself. Yeah. I cut every tree around the house away from the house. Uh-huh. But care of the problem. Haven't seen a rat since. So, another word, but they don't stay, what do they do? Like, in the base of the trees, they nest or something? They nest all over the trees. They come through and then they climb up onto your roof and things like that through the trees. So any of them. You can tell me if I cut the tree the way from the house, they wouldn't come near the house anymore. And I haven't seen one since. Excellent, the amount. Thanks, pal. Well, I got, I got one for your whole thing. Go ahead. How about Rick Shaw? Guys, 180 years old, it's got the same hat on, he's had on for 30 years. It's enough to him. Okay, thanks, pal. Sorry. Poor Rich Shaw. He's got him sure he's listening right now. I think we love you, Rick, but go away. That's what the guy's basically saying. You've been here too long. Oh, here's an answer from my rat problem on two. It's in Miramar. Hello. Hey, Mr. Rogers. I got you. Yes, sir. I got you. I got you. Yes, sir. I got you. Yeah, the next time that you get ready to go back to Toronto when you're down here. Go out and get 10 gallons of ammonia. Yeah, we're household ammonia. Huh? Set them up in each room of your house, open them up, and leave. And then go up to your Toronto. When you come back, you will not have a roach or rat problem or beef problem at all. Just from the smell of the ammonia. Just from the smell of the ammonia. You will seep up through there. They don't like to eat on your cell. And then what happens when you take the things of the ammonia way? They'll be gone because they'll have the memory of the fact that the spell that was in there. So another one can write that there. They kind of memorize the addresses of the people that got the ammonia. I wouldn't say they remember. But it's kind of like a padlaw type thing. Right, right. They did turn, right. Yeah. But it worked. I'm 100% guaranteed. Okay, thanks, pal. Go out. I'll think John B. to have you bought that. But yeah, it's too bad. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, keep. 5, 6, 6, the AT and T improvise the Wireless line. I'm depressed that you told me ATM that it's such a wonderful job because they knew they would. Right, but he misunderstood my note that I left one day when I came to work and he called Krispy Critters again. Alas. And maybe that'll be fine. I mean, they have caught it rat so far. They put the traps up there what opinion butter and if you ever get hungry, you know we've got like a little snack waiting. Get some crackers. Right. But it just seems to me. There must be, I mean, there could be dozens of them if they were like living in a tree. I didn't realize they're rest-living trees. I thought they had nowhere, anywhere they want to live. Really? And they go anywhere they want to go. That's why they explain that's an ongoing thing. All the pests in Florida, pest controls an ongoing maintenance thing that you have to stay on top of. There's no just treat and then forget about it. Your house is going to be clean for out. No treat, no. Well, I got to get it. Reach me. Well, how come I've been in that house all of these years and up until April of this year? I never heard of one ranch, graduate. I never had nothing in the attic been lucky that just took them all to find you. I'll be damned. Pastards. 560, 505, 60, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon line.

I know that they told us that which is why and a holiday weekend, they just put the traps up there with the peanut butter.

That when he came in here to be an intern to train to run the board that's still that's still what's going on So he's an intern he's still learning yeah on our time on our time and on our time on this highly rated show No wonder we got problems man I'm thinking maybe the beast It's quite a you best dude siendo let's merke good my Alright! For 32 or 5, 60WQM, we used to be the new Rogers show and now I feel like a lost control here. Feel like a big fat old stepchild.

I can smell them all the way up here. Must be that ammonia that I was talking about. That ammonium D. Because I haven't got any idea what's going on here. All these stories about this Scott is this and Scott's a friend of Scott Ferrell and you're the whole night of the flash and now Miguel is sitting there and he told me this morning he was going off the jersey but he never said when and all of a sudden he just disappears. Oh, he's gone. He will cut a plane to go. What? And I told you, so does it happen. Old crap, I'm sitting here talking to him. I'm sitting here. I'm thinking that he's there and then you say, oh, he's gone. I mean, I know I have these great psychic powers but I'm not exactly reaver from guiding light, you know. Miguel came on the mic. Well, he couldn't, he's done that before. Scott could've gone out to take a crap. Have you ever gone out to take a crap? How many times you go out to take a crap during his show today? I've heard him man. So there you go. You think you're the owner when it's full of crap? And he else got some crap in there. Believe me. That's what the Reen said. He's full of crap and that's only because she's pissed because he won't do her. I need to do anything else alive. Even a rat's in my attic wouldn't touch that bitch. But anyway, see you're trying to side my track me again, not in Doreen. The fact of the matter is we don't have to, you know, have like a big stimulus, especially out of Friday going into a nice weekend. A big stimulus about this? We are. Yeah, we are. I, I, I should like I say we need to have a big stimulus about this. Okay. I'd like to have like somebody in there who like is a communicative. You know, who might like once in a while, which leaves Miguel out, it's because I told him to shut up. Fine? I told him to shut up because you told him to shut up. It's because he has nothing to say. He has absolutely done nothing to say. I say we get the beast in there. What do you say? Huh? Let's make a swap. That's a good idea. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Silence. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Nothing. Anyone for anything. I'm recommending movies is all I'm doing it from now on. Yeah. I'm not recommending anyone for anything. It would. It would, which turned out to be a bitter disappointment. All sorry. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, let's, let's, let's, let's say, do screenless the rest of it because Miguel is having standard a lot of pressure and he can't be bothered with that. Thanks. No, sure, sir. I don't want you to have to go through that in addition to which you know, we already stressed out from the reen. If anything of that creation were chasing me or I already have the stock wrap here. I got Rimmer. That's a good pull question, which is worse to be chased by Rimmer or Doreen? Yeah. I haven't sure, I hello. Why you have this? Oh, oh, there he is. I thought you something was wrong. Did it whisper? What a same old crap, but he still there every goddamn day. What is one or two lines? Retire. Why you something, your ball? You're pathetic, you're tragic. Why don't you go in a rat? We'll see if we can catch you in a big trap, okay? Let's stick it to God damn bowl of ammonia. You jackass, you piece of turd. Man, I've flush better things down this morning. You turn than you. Ascle and have a nice weekend. Ferrell will be at Ole Ole on the Los Angeles River from six to eight tonight, given away Dolphin tickets. What do you do? I mean, go see him. And Miguel rhymes with the Ferrell. In coconut creek at the Seminole Casino 5550 Northwest 40, a 3-3-3-5-to-5-to-sat noon just off San Ferrell west of the turnpike. And then, if that wasn't good enough, join QM tonight, now who's going to be on that? Are you going to be on that too? Yes sir. Wow, and Joe's busy beaver today? You have no idea. You said he likes busy beaver. Join QM tonight, the Hooders in Basside 79 PM staff by the win prize. And you have bucket of five. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, there. What does that mean? A bucket of five president of beer for eight fifty. Well, somebody teach this boy English, okay? A bucket of five for eight fifty president of the beer. You start to speak like Lucy, okay? Like this ear is. Lucy, Lucy, you know. Enjoy a bucket of five for eight fifty president of the beer. How about a bucket of five president of the beer is for eight fifty? How does that sound? Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I like to sound like a culture guy even on my faddle of a slab. I like to sound like at least not illiterate, you know? Like to put on a good act for these people. So whatever, going to go and see Miguel and tell me, you get some beer. You get a bunch of beer, okay? And buy some of our best in the stuff. Because if we aren't over 20 grand by next week, we've got to be over right now, but we're not getting any more reports. You're okay? I forgot to total my desk here in 19 something. Now we were in 19 for before yesterday, even. We had 19,400 before the show yesterday. Right. You're still in that vicinity. Well, what does that mean? Uh, for what's it since the other day, you have two hundred and forty something dollars on. Well, that's not going to cut the mustard. What is with these people out there? We got our best in the old, we didn't even put a CD out last year. We got the two thousand, two thousand three CDs. We got the more Howard David. Absolutely. We got some of those demand though. We had all kinds of good stuff. For a banded pair rescue, which is a sensational charity, by the way. And you can read all of the booth right there on our website. Just click onto the thing there. Boy, you're right. This is not the town there to be doing anything. But whatever we get now, it'll be gravy. You know what I'm saying? Right. Because we can go like we always do right through January 1. But it'll just be a little icing on the cake, a little gravy, a little mashed potatoes, whatever. But boy, this is, I guess I shouldn't be gullier. In fact, that nobody went to the Marlok game yesterday because no matter if they win every game, which they haven't lately just about, there's nobody there to go. There's nobody there. Just like to look at this, I'm doing screenless right now. There's one call ring on the thing. I say we just do that best of that comedy bits are four hours a day until the people come back. All right. Don't think that's a good idea? Absolutely. Like about a week before my vacation in December sounds good. Stop dancing, George. WCUAM. You. Yes, sir. What's up, man? I got a, I got a clown for your bowl. Okay. Danny, I can't wear a Super Bowl, Marino. Why is that? Is he playing on the team now? Nobody looked down here and wepton. And so was he bothering you? He kind of looks funny, no? Yeah, he doesn't have bad lips, you're right. Now get out of here, get out of here. What would see you, people are mean, you're cruel, you're nasty, you're rotten. Danny can't win a Super Bowl, Marino. Next to Pavellbury, the greatest athlete who ever put on a jox-drap for a soft-loaded team. No question about it. And maybe even of a superior than Pavell, Pavlov, and his stupid brother. And here this guy, see this is the problem in soft-loaded. You can never do enough for them. It's always, it's always the old cry baby act. You're much a cry baby's man, you make me sick. I'm so glad I'm out there, I can't begin to tell you. You only need the only negative thing I can find a Toronto right now is the rumors. That's the only thing. And you know what the good news is? What? Tell me, gone soon. Why? And local, here's the Portuguese Winniere 566U and UAM. Get my amy. You never know when the power might go. Oh, oh, oh, no, damn it, I'm not with all this hair. This is the worst power out of the American history. And we're out of batteries, we're going to do! We're going to do! Introducing the Hummer H3 Solar Powered Bibrator. Oh, that's it, nothing's possible. These more power than you should get the Hummer H4 nuclear powered kickstart remote control vibrator. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Number, alternative energy vibrators. They won't leave you. Oh, oh, oh. Cup 44 or 560's speaking of the Hummer. We got the mad dog at 2 the Hummer will be on 4 to 630 from the Crystal Palace of the Bahamas, including the on tape Dave Wantset, 25 to 6, and then the Marlin game from San Juan Porto Rico. Marlins on the Xbox Big Series man, humongous. Eddie K. F. to the baseball game, ESPN radio overnight, it's bad. Use it business to give file series anesty. I'll be right through that story, which I found on Munsemiul's website. Nice going, man. The thing with this crispy critters, I'm starting to realize how stupid I am, you know? Because you know what they do is they set the traps, they put the penis peanut butter crap that they have like an a tube. Okay, they stick to the peanut butter, uh, what a concoction on a trap. And then when they come back, they go check the traps. So if there's three rats, they charge you so much perrata to catch. Well, I mean, that's like catching fish in a barrel, you know what I'm saying? Uh-huh. I can keep setting those up there forever, and the scent of the more that peanut butter I slap on here, the more they're going to get the scent, and then we're going to come marching in, we're going to crevices are. And of course, then they keep stall off, and they're going to come and close everything up there because they're really busy, where we need to be, you know, that crap. And in the meantime, I'm paying into catch fish in a barrel. What does that deal? A good deal, so I'd like to know. Probably most of them animals wouldn't be going in there if they weren't smell the peanut butter in the first place. It's not like they're up there running around all the time. They're not there. They're like you set out in the trees. They're hanging in the a hood. Right, rats, rats in the hood. Boy, boy, what a schmuck I am. Crispy critters, my ass. Well, this is their last chance this weekend, again, they're whole house like a hermetically sealed. And if I find one possum, one rat, one cool, and anywhere near my house, then the schmits go ahead to fan. Then you'll see some real crispy critters in that place. Anyway, don't you agree? Yeah, well, I agreed way earlier. If you just set up a, uh, a track and put some crap in it, there's like 80's in it in the hood. They're better, they're going to smell it, you know? And come running. They're going to smell of it. The R.I. speaking of something that really stinks the R.I.A.A.A.A. the recording industry association of America, Plans, when I was an Anastee program this week, that will let individual online copyright infringers off the hook for old times sake if they changed their way sources say. Oh, the Anastee program that apply only to alleged infringers who have not been sued by the music industry trade group, or identify by internet service providers as visibility trade groups subpoony process. The alleged commercial pirates will not receive Anastee. According to the sources, the R.I.A.A. will not pursue legal. I don't like the R.I.A. as much as I like that stuff I was talking about yesterday. The T. Oh my, I love that. Too bad we wasted such a good bunch of shows this week on what we got down there now, you know, after hearing from nothing but the misfits pretty much. Yeah, who never leave there. Anyway, they will not pursue legal acts if infringers delete all of the rights music files from their computers, destroying all copies, including CDRs, CDRs, why is it say CDRs and that CDRs are the recordable CDs that's all that's right. That's right, okay. I'm promising. Not to upload such material in the future. Each infringing household member will have to send a completed notarized Anastee from the R.I.A. with a copy of a photo ID. Those who are we nigg on their promise will be subject to changes of a willful copyright infringement. The Anastee program will be revealed about the same time. The R.I.A. is expected not to find several hundred infringement suits. The R.I.A. had no comment. It's called to me like a trap and then I put an opinion but a run it. Does it in that story or any of the other ones that you've said to they talk about which ISPs are actually giving up their users? No. Well, wasn't it Verizon? Was that one of them? I don't know. Yes, it was Verizon. I don't know about the other ones that I want to mention no name. But anyway, I'm sure it's pretty nervous because you know. 560560. I'm still parked off about this scot thing. I hate to do this on the air but it's just I don't understand what you're port off about it. I'm parked off of the fact that we got some guy that we got tossed in here because he's a buddy of Scott. And he seems like an decent guy but he's got nothing to say. He has no way. I know he's got up. That no connection with his show whatsoever. And you know, I think we bring B-Nervoy back and see there B-Nervoy at the B somebody with a B. At least B-Nervoy was fun at a party. But he laughed at about it. It's a truth. I mean, I kind of imagine too many bits of book of Brian's going to be doing about Scott Junior. Can you? No, yeah. No, I don't know. I mean, it's not that I'm picking on him behind his back. I was picking on him when I was there and he just he just I rolled him to dummy up. Why? Why? Why? Nobody wants to hear from him. That's why. There he goes. Ha ha ha ha ha. Same ago has a pair. I'm like George who's again trying to be defensive because he's to at least you're two for two now. You're bent in a thousand. Well, people barely went in here from George while we went in here from the board up. Well, I mean, but if I ask him something just like when I asked him what team he was a fan of when we went through all these. Yeah, he had like that's his way of being and being cute. Yeah, that's what he thought he was about as cute as Doreen's ass man. How do you like that? That ain't my idea of cute. Anyway, we'll work it out. Or not, or just have the room empty in there. Maybe we can get the, maybe we can get the sponsor on the autopilot. That sound good. All right. Okay. Five, six, seven. We're looking today and it's really a brutal brutal Friday. I can't believe that this crowd is doing this to me today. But hey, I'm used to it all these years. Not turned man. Never changes. Man, I'm as happy as a pig and slop or work on a kitchen and Marance with all kinds of peanut butter. Extra crunchy by the way this weekend with our crispy critters people. No, that's that to me. That's a scam. And I have to be a real moron. I admit, but when you're going to charge people for kitchen stuff that you're drawing in yourself, you know, be like here. I'm going to give you a put a whole bunch of fish in a bowl in a barrel and give you a pull. Yeah. With some beer. And then every time you get a fish out of them, I'm going to charge you for it. If you could boot one person out of south Florida, who would it be? OJ, you're in a league of your own. You and some of the others. OJ 117 and Colter 53. Mohour David at 52 is right on Anne's ass. I'd love I'd pay to see that. Alex Pinga Peking and not doing this well as I thought he would. 26. Out of sight, out of mind. Miriam elephant 20. Ozek and Succo 17. Wayne Hizenga 14. Ricky Tickie says he's 13. I know we added him on late, but I thought that we'd give him the handicap. He goes zooming up there, didn't you? I thought so. Not doing well. 13. Reverend David Kennedy or Jane whatever in his name is James Kennedy 9. Miss Matt Fudge 7. Maris Greasy as 6. Jay Feetler 5. Gloria Stephon has got four. Bill Spilky's in the race got one. Make yours in one. Non for Rimmer or Dwight Lawdwell. I said, I told you don't put them on there. Did I say that? I mean, I did say eventually put them on there by thought do they get no votes. What's what? What is Rimmer? And if you kick him out of there, he's got to be chased me all over the place like he's doing now. I know. I was a, it was a big opening right there. Correct. WQAM. Neil. Yes sir. I do on my friend. Okay. I'm doing great. All the ISPs are doing are giving up their members. They wanted had to dance to fight with Verizon. I'll be there. Oh, they thought Verizon thought they were the first one to give them up. No, no, no, they were fighting them in court. And of course with this Nazi regime we have in power. Jay lost the battle. I'll be there. So they have to give up all the names. Oh well. I'll be helping Toronto my friend. I'll be a Vancouver. Yeah. Well, maybe I've no kept being by Rimmer's in dinner. Hey, sir. Chris Columbia. Sounds good to me, my friend. Have a good time, amigo. I'm glad to have a fight with us. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T. We're doing screenless now on the Sloan Hill. WQAM. Yes sir. I got nothing else for your bowl. Okay. Chris Bush. Hmm. See what I mean? Nothing but a list fits in there. That's all we've got. Air v-cronic, air v-regular, air v-mout content, air v-missfit, air v-suck hole. That's all we've got. And like I said, see, it's not me after all these years. I used to get a lot of the old Neil's so negative. And Neil's always knocking soft for I'm just telling you exactly the way it is. Okay. That's not the way I wanted. That's not the way I like it. It's taking years off all of our lives. And we've had to put up with such a bunch of miserable assholes. Okay. That we've had to live in the midst of such a bunch of swirl. God. Front running, phony baloney. I mean, any adjective you can come up with is negative to it. I'll vote for it. Said it's prophetic, it's tragic. It's debilitating. Do I really give a crap? No, but it sounds good. It's good theater like Mr. Ego would say. It's good drama. W-Q-I-M. Yeah, I got one. I drew a rose in half. I was so tired and him and his antics. Every show, every... Chockeys got signed up. And now he's doing Jackie Johnson. I like it. Thanks, pal. Oh, I don't like he's doing Jackie Johnson. I don't really care. She's a monkey face. She is. She's a monkey face. I don't care what you guys say. She's not attractive. She may have nice hair, but you know who else had nice hair? I'm silly. I'm losing. I'm dead now. And she also was a monkey face by the way. Now I guess she's kind of Schmidt-Faced. 560560, Pond 560 on the AT&T and Verizon. While he was flying in fact the former chancellor of West Germany. Remember how much Smith? No. He was Schmidt-Faced. W-Q-I-M. Yeah. But he sure wore an interesting helmet. Yes, sir. I'm a rat rat with a peanut butter. It's definitely a scam. Yeah. Copycute is it's called critter control. And I'm getting started to get out of control thinking about what they're doing to me. Ripen. Why? I use the rat for food for my turtle. Yeah. I'm a turtle pen in the back. And it's on the other side of the fence is a storm drain. So I put the peanut butter out and come over the fence. They eat the pizza. Eat the peanut butter. You caught the trap. I see them at a turtle. Excellent. Good idea. Good idea. Good idea. And my whole life I've always agonized over this. I think I threw it in a waste basket before it was really dead. You know, I think it was just kind of... Huh? You know what I mean? Yeah. It was just kind of resting. You know how they pull her head in. And well, you of course, you know how they pull her hands on it. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. You know how that works. And then even out and then it would like pop right out. When you at least expect it. Especially for the snapping turtle. Oh, yeah. Ha ha ha ha. Oh, yeah. Sometimes they bite. Ha ha. That it anyway. It was called Murdoch turtle. And it was a... You know, actually Murdoch turtle. I don't know. It's so long ago. You know, it's about 100 years ago. I also had like one of them painted turtles, you know those. That can't be good. No, it's not. That was just... That must have been a long time ago. Oh, yeah. Wow. It was like five years old. So that's like 56 years ago. I'm almost 61 years old. I'm so glad they am old. I can't even count it anymore. That seems to their system. Well, that's not good. No. Well, I wonder if God's sick and I had a throw in a waste basket. In a garbage in a garbage can of a sign. The name of the street we lived on a Rochester by the way was okay. Terrorists. Never been. It was called okay. Terrorists. Okay. Terrorists. And was it? Now it's all dark man. Really a dark neighborhood. Wow. Wow. Anyway, we're just singing along. We're just telling some time for you. We appreciate the fact that you're hanging with us because it's desperate. It's just desperate, don't you? I'm so, so, so pleased that I'm not there. You have no idea. I was there for a week. It seemed like it was a century. I'm not exaggerating. You could see that I just, I was at my wits end. And then I get sucked in this crispy critter deal. You know what these are? Oh yeah. We're going to catch a hundred rats for it. And it's only like a twenty bucks a piece. I'm sending you a very encouraging fact that you'll enjoy reading during the brain. What do you mean by that? That you'll enjoy reading during the break.

No. So, there's now a tornado warning for Miami-Dade County. Until 130 Eastern time. Apparently, we're going to need continuation of this. We're going to get some of these from Henri. One of the things you do worry about when a tropical cyclone makes landfall. Or is the potential for tornadoes? I'm sure a tornado watch will probably be issued for Florida before it's all over. Certainly going to watch that as that could be very dangerous. Like I said, I sure must be in down here, man. That's part of that tropical storm on rean. Then, of course, you got the hurricane. The big one out there, Bermuda. It's been a wipeout South Carolina. But anyway, tornado warning for Dave County to 130. For a while, of course, she's this is on CNN. She's seen for Miami. What is that? That's the ass end of the big storm that's going to wipe out Tampa Orlando and Dave Hona Beach. So, here's this fact. And did I just hear Joe Rose say the Netherlands? I don't know. I don't listen to our thoughts. Is that like anywhere near the hinterlands? I'm sure that's why I said the Netherlands. Joe, it's time to grab the wood. Yeah. Nice facts to let you set me from our close personal friend, Steve at ATM. Oh, why didn't John listen me? I put the card out there, but I guess he misunderstood any call. Chris B. Critters instead about we can have to go when this whole thing started. And two late now. So what do I do? Because I should have read this? Oh, that's up to you. It's just, it's up for your information kind of thing. Yeah. But I mean, how do we, how do I extricate myself from the, your first crispy critters people who are charting or rafing me by the, I did, right? No, no one kind of a contract you signed, but if you didn't sign anything. Then, bye, bye. Yeah. But I mean, today's today, they're like, See one, everything up. That wouldn't be the appropriate day to say bye, bye, bye. What do I, I guess not? No. In the future, though, as soon as they're done sealing it up. Well, I'm going to save this and then like, I'll let you know the progress next week. And then we'll like, you know, but it doesn't sound too promising to me. Because that, it's, it's, you know, that old term bait and switch. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm being bait and switched myself on at peanut butter crab. It, it, it, it, it's insanity. It's like saying, hey, look, I can catch all these fish out here. How much you're going to pay me for each one I catch? Let me throw them to the water first. At least a fish you can take them out on the grill and fry them up. You don't have a supper unless you want to eat dead rat and get maybe SARS or something. There's probably not a real good idea. Why don't you, you wouldn't be the first? 560560 pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lime. We got so many problems and so many, uh, uh, assholes. W to Q AM. Yes sir. Yeah. My wife has a little rat bomb that are quite of a point of point of view. Yeah. And they use slim gym and traps. But that says he wanted to look at that peanut butter. Yummy. Uh-huh. I think what they use about 70 traps up there. And, uh, I think today was the day to go up there and get them all. I guess. Okay. See, he doesn't understand that if they're like putting a slim gym, there's probably rats going to be coming in from Palm Beach County, right? Right? I've been going to have this guy works. I mean, it's just, I just come in since. I'm really a lot dumber than I thought, but at least I admit it. 560560 pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless lime. WQAM. Neil. Yes sir. Lovely show you got going on. I got somebody for your pole. Yes? Joey, the terrorist, the sulto. Do you want to go to the sulto? Yes sir. Who knows Joey, basuto? I don't know. Well, I'm going to put him on the pole. I mean, the name sounds familiar. One of those rattle. What is from your rival's hockey? Who is it? Basuto's from brother to the rescue. Is it Joey? I'll say. Oh, I don't put him on. We don't know who that is. Most of our people speaking was Miguel Wilvore on it. WQAM. Hello. Yes sir. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Victor. How are you doing? I'm doing sensational man. Hey, let me ask you a question. Why are all of these politicians getting in the middle of our sports? Such a mess. What the hell do they know? Why is George Bush coming on before the beginning of the season? Why is Russia limbo doing the commentating? Who the hell cares about what the hell the politicians have to say when we're sitting here and talking about broadcasting the naive and unsurpecting public. We are. Right. And they have to go on running for the governor of the largest state and you're asking me if the American public is stupid? No, we already know they are. We're poor. Exactly. Look who our governor is. Right. You know it goes hand in hand. Okay. Good luck to you sir. I'll see you tomorrow. Give you a special dispensation to come across. 560, 505, 60, pound 560.

I didn't see that. They used to be up under because it sticks to the trap. The rastitz marms it off off. And it'll just carry the food away. The peanut butter actually sticks to the trap. Yeah. But I'm sure that the aroma of it attracts the rast, doesn't it? I don't know about that. Anything will attract the rast. Right. So what's the point? They know if they know there's like a thousand rast in the neighborhood and the treason everything. They can keep putting food up there and it's like free buffet. Yeah. They will play for the soccer screens around your house. They're supposedly supposedly doing that today and they damn well better be. Yeah. That's the first thing you'd do before you set the trap so it'll just keep crawling in. Once they feel it all out, you should be good to go. Once they set the trap. Well, we'll know in a couple of days. Thanks for the good news, pal. Have a good week. And you too. Well, no. A couple of days if Krispy critters is really doing it or if they're just given out a rat buffet. Yeah. Why don't we just put a nice spread out there for crying out loud? Sure.

A huge great privilege to be here at Outline a new budget. That's where O'Dars would have ordered to come up with a number for tax relief. And my plan, no one will get relief. For lower income families, you'll never get ahead. And this president doesn't care and won't pay. My attitude is government should stand in the way a family is achieving their dreams together. We will do so. I hope you'll join me in standing firmly. On Restrain. Some say my two big. Others. Others say it's too small. I respectfully disagree. This is just right. Okay, so I'm watching CNN and they're doing the thing again. They're about the answer. The tornado warning for Dave County. Okay, so I click on to the Sun Sentinel and forget about it. And I click on to the Harold. And they got a big thing on their weather. Page. Hurricane Fabian. I'm looking all over the place. Where's the story? Where's the beef you assholes? Here's tropical storm. The sun re which is pretty ordinary. And oh, here you go. Lay this public advisories. Do you think it's going to be there? Statistics and warnings. Okay, well, they should be it. You have to like practically standing. Don't you think that should be like a bulletin? You think. Alice, wrong with these assholes. Let me just yank my thing over here. We pull it over. There's nothing on here. This is an advisory on the goddamn tropical storm. You got nothing to do with a tornado warnings or anything else. You got to get it from CNN and the Harold and the Sun Sentinel already get his hemorrhids when he wiped your ass with it? That's pretty damn classy. What a crocker crap. There's another reason to upload a cannot extricated cell from the state in which it finds itself. Lower it down. 560 pound, 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

And Scott for real will be at the OLE OLE on Los Angeles Riverfront from 6 to 8 tonight. And he'll have some dolphin tickets to give away some free crap for all you free loaders. WQAM. I want to ask you something about that music sharing. Maybe I'm overlooking the audience. Yes? If you download music, I'm speaking hypothetically and okay. Right. Of course. Of course. Because nobody would really do that right now. No, no. That's against the law. But if you download a file from Puzzah or what have you. And if it's downloaded you stick it in another file, then how can they catch you? Is that out of you? George. I don't know. Or like what if you burn it to a CD and then he raised the file you just downloaded and take it off your computer. Sounds like a plan to me. I mean, we're trying to make it hard to accept like a theory to make. And throw your computer in the canal and buy it in the oven. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's a busy weekend. And I know. I know. Long list the faces. The legal things that are going on. I'm so sick and tired of this. The fascist regime. I never do anything illegal. Sick and tired of fascist and crazy right wing religious nuts on the loose because that's the American F and Freaking Way. So if I buy a CD and I let a friend listen to it. Yeah. File sharing. Yes. Only if you're learning your nail file. That's right. What if you're on somebody who nail file, they're going to like get you for that too. It is file sharing. I'll do well enough. They're in guys at file or nails. I can't stand guys at file or nails. You want to know why? Why? Because it means they have nails. That's good. I'll never know if you guys don't do their fingernails. I don't do my fingernails. You have fingernails? I don't do them. I cut them with clippers. You. But you don't file them. No. Oh, I defiled them. Thank goodness for that. Because if you came on a year today and said, Do you filed your nails? I think that'd be the last straw. The last nail. So to speak. In your coffin. Man. Talk about your image. WKOM. You can. QAM. A- A- Darkling over there. Well, too late, Pat. You're too slow for me. WKOM. Hello. Yes, sir. On your ranch situation. Yes. D-Con makes their blue blocks. There's eight blocks in a pack. It's just cost you $4.50. And what happens is they've rat-edged it. And it takes three days. And what happens is they get thirsty. They go outside to go out and get water. Because they get- And when they drink, and when they drink, they blow up inside, right? Yes, sir. Now. But the thing is, they don't drink in your house. They drink outside. And then if you're- For a problem, probably the crispy critters people probably put a bowl of water up there for them. You're adding. Well, you know, the thing is, I don't- I don't know if you really want to blame them for attracting stuff that comes inside. Because what happens is when there's one rat, there's more than one. Okay? Right. And I had three total. Three days later, I kid you not. I came home. And the three of them were going out after they had consumed the deacon blue block. Yeah. And I'm telling you, man, my dog nailed. Every one of them picked them up broke through, you know, broke their neck. And then I got the rats out. And then they're... Oh, right. So that's what you- That's- for $4.50, that's all you need. But, but I don't understand. But, what do you put it in? I mean, just- No, no, it's a block. It just sits- If your roommate can go up and put it in an attic, that's fine. I put mine in the garage. What they do is they run along a trail. And you have to put it on the edge of the garage. Yeah. They don't go in the middle. They stay on the edge at night. Because- Why is that? Because their whiskers are their feelers. And they stay on the edge. So I put everything on the edge of the garage, and it worked out great. Huh. That's the key. Well, let me ask you this. What if you put that stuff like outside? No, because- What'll happen is, um, another animal will come out and eat it. Yeah. And, no, you want to- If you have a garage in an attic, I don't know how your house is set up. Yeah, I have a garage with a thing, an attic over it. And I also have the attic over the bedroom. And the guy who called early about the air conditioner thing, right? Do go through the air conditioner. I got an air conditioner thing where they came in through from the outside. So he's right about that, and they take it, and they go up, they climb up and go into the attic. So if you can get it placed right by the air conditioner, I don't know what they call it. It's a metal thing, and the pipes you can see the pipes going up. And, um, but I tell you what, man, for $4.50, it got rid of my problem. Okay, thanks, pal. You always have it. Well, now you're in the summertime, but I usually get it right before fall because what they do is they're looking for some place warm to go. Maybe a block of ice up there, couldn't be bad either. Yes, sir. Okay, thanks a lot. Yes, sir. There you go. How about some blue block, man? Sounds good to me. A blue block or pretty old cocker? What? Yeah. And I have read about that where they eat the, they chew the stuff and they go outside and makes them very thirsty when they drink it. Like all the blows up inside and they just look, man. They go outside unless they can get inside in which case they, uh, you'll find them dead in your toilet. I'll find them dead in my toilet. Well, they'll go for that water, and they'll go in there and get a drink and they'll die in your toilet. Well, what do you mean they'll go in there and get a drink? I'm going to get into my toilet. A climb, claw crawl. From where? So in other words, you're like, now you're telling me they're in the house. They can't, if they can get in the house. Now you're telling me they're in my freaking house. This is the first thing I said is if they can get in there, they will. Hop it around. Have them. Yeah, check under the bed. Every night. Sweet tight. I don't have no rents here, okay? Oh no. One org is reason not to be there. No rents in Toronto. Just stars. And what's now? Well, that's where you got plenty of West now out there. 560, 750, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Limbo. We are rat intensive today. Perfect for QA and by the way. WQAM. Oh, oh.

Speaking of blue blocker. I'm going to tell you. I might vomit. I've realized this on here. It showed a picture of Michael Jordan and it said Jordan coming back again.

You rekindled my interest in it and it's something you haven't played in ages. And that's the other. I don't have it. You're talking about that Sunday silence easy go or thing with time. You're going to be a little bit more correct, sir. I'm here speaking in the chair because it's right from the horses' ass. I don't have that. Oh, man. He is the king, man. There's no criminal. And that's why I was going to put this on because I just went to the racing channel. Yeah, and they're off. Number eight, gold, flinger, unseated the rider. How do you like that? If the start is eight, what do you do? He acted up. He unseated the rider when he came out of the gate. He rubber top is out. This guy's terrible.

Yeah, actually, I like the horse. I like the aim because that's one thing that I like for two finals on Sundays. Exactly. So have a lovely weekend. And you two, thanks. Thanks, Pally. Oh, yeah, then eight horses through. How do you like that? Wasn't that a propitious moment to be looking at that thing? I don't turn it off. Which I'd seen it. I wouldn't better wipe off my propitia. We got 145 hosts for O.J. Man. He is all alone. There ain't nobody near him. If you could boot one person out of South Florida, who would it be? O.J. has got 145 hosts. And that's out of 432. I mean, he's off to the races. Mohar David, though, is head and head, knows to know his big and horse races with Anne Colter, most got 64 and Anne's got 63. Maybe we could make a package deal on Greyhound bus. Alex Pinga Piccania 31, Miriam Elephant 24, H Wayne Hypinga 18, I'll decide out of mine. There was a time when he would have been maybe right up there on O.J. Zash, you know. That would have been a nobody. He's small potatoes now. Jose Consocco 17, Reverend James Kennedy 16, Rick Sanchez, only 16. Now that's pretty surprising, you know what? He's been on there long enough now to be up there in the Elydabad on shocked and displayed. On the Elydor Hosen. Maris Grecia's got 10, Miss Matt Fudge's got only seven.

Mickey Harrison won and Dwight Lauderdale's got one. Somebody out there had a stick at the poor Dwight. Come in to QAM. Fight your back. There he is. I'm interesting, but line six, it's always him. How does he do that? It's the matcha line. Is that the Magi line? Come in to QAM. Neil, I got someone for your poll. Yes? I see him in. I see him in. He isn't old ass. So I will put him on there, but he's so pathetic. I mean, I don't think he could handle it. I think just a trip up to the state line. That would be the end of him. Tell us. Tell us. I'll get some damn votes. OK. Thank you. You got it. I see him in. Funny that he all likes demons. Who's always sucking around sucking out Mickey Harrison's ass. And I always tell you, you're at idiot. I, the fact that they keep, you know, dusting off the mothballs and dragging him out of the broom closet is so sad on NBC six, you know? Joe Rose is the other sentence to the Nether world. That's what he said. So I wasn't quite sure where that is, but the Nether lands come on show what is. I mean, I know the metal lands. You know that. Yeah, but not the Nether lands. Joe needs to get out a little bit more. See the only problem is he has a tough time at customs with that big head. A lot of times they tell him to check it. He could smuggle a lot in there. Oh, you can, you would just imagine, wow, just inside the left ear. WQA in. Hey, Liam. Yes, sir. Hey, he's still doing the pole for a room. So I'll get fired from you, Adam. Go ahead, give us this suggestion. I thought we already finished up. Go ahead. Oh, I got the correct answer.

Now he must have all the naked pictures of Greg with screw-in and with Philips and with the certain other one. He must have those naked pictures from over the years. What other reason could there? Or maybe he's got the pictures of a kid curry and Anna Squeak. Those intimate pictures and album. Five, six tell me. Maybe he's got the pictures with Joe Costello and what's your name? What's your personal friend, Beau Griffin? In that fist fight. Oh, I'm so sorry. I missed that. That's one of the few things that I feel I really missed out on by not being there. Most of the time, which usually lights me. Well, I wasn't in the room, but I wish I had been. Who the hell are you? And who you talking to? The few is some piece of work. By the way, we ought to talk about her little, but you know, Bob Beau, but I guess not. Well, we better not. All right. Now, she's the kind of brother that'll come back and you know, like, start suing everybody. She's just, yeah, you're right. Just that, just that. Butch. 21 till 2 at 5, 60, WCM 2, clock means the Jim Mad Dog Manage show. I'll be in rare form today because the regular season now. All the four plates gone. All those meaningless exhibition games.

She probably have a good time over there, you know what all those... Yeah, what? Anyway, Jane, what a ride! One of our regular, uh, taxes and forlaterdills is it's a story about a ride, but I don't really understand it. Well, I mean, I do understand it because, but at the end, there's a sentence here about rats, are one of the few animals love humans that have benefited from human screwing up the planet. Oh, yeah. Do you understand that? Absolutely, they have thrived because of us. Why see they love humans because they've benefited from muskware. I, it's, or whatever. Okay, thank you, Jane.

Grosses me out. Maus don't bother me. I know, in fact, Trist Radford was telling me, speaking of Troy the boy. He was saying to me, even like a little Maus who gets all freaked out. And that's pretty, that's, you gotta be a real pussy. I think Dark Pokesk it freaked out by a rodents, you know what? And spiders and snakes. All of these things. 153 votes for OJ two bad, all of those things didn't cross the path of Nicole and Ron that night, and Chase's awful murdering ass away. They'd still be here today, maybe. OJ 153 and Kaur 67, but they despise that bitch and then rightfully so. Right wing slut. Howard David had 66 continuous following right with his nose on her ass.

Reverend Kennedy's moved into a double digit 18, who's they con soco 17, Ricky Tickie Sanchez, out of sight out of mind 17.

John Kagel, I was just wondering if you were talking about plasma TV's little earlier. And I was wondering if anybody out there knows what the deal is with eBay on those plasma's. You can negotiate a plasma TV from $2,000 for the same thing that cost 10,000 in the stores. Right. And it's reef preshipping and they pay the, there's it's all warranty did everything. And I was negotiating with two of them with the 50th and Chessoni, and one with a number of people who are bidding on eBay, no, no. I wasn't going to buy it outright. I see. And that was $2000 for the pioneer in the same exact thing, sales for $9,000 over the figures. Wow. And the same thing with the 50 inch Sony television. And I was just wondering if that's a rip off or what? It does sell off the truck. party. Scratch and send sale. No, they say it's brand new in the box never opened. Well, I think you were, you test it out and we'll let us know how you make out. Well, I'm going to, I don't know. The other problem is is you negotiate with them and they're both of them, the two that I negotiate with. Yeah. One is initially and one is in Germany. Like I said, forget about it. We're going to the street in this words, forget about it. The other thing that I wanted to tell you, years ago in 1997, you're the responsible for me driving more Corvette. Oh, right. That's one of my magnificent choice. In 1997, you were talking about him and I was ready to get rid of my little cat-elect that I had and I went out and I brought one up and suffered for it. I still have it. It's brand new, sitting in my garage. Greatest thing ever invented. And I love it. I'll take care of you. I'll take care of you. Have a great weekend. Thank you. Thanks. Don't do that eBay thing. You're coming from Germany and from Italy. Well, later I've been out piece by piece. Right, he's been a good. Sooner or later. 560, 0.50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 80, 80 and 10. Verizon Wireless Line. Big sports weekend coming up, man. Wow, can you smell the pressure or what? Especially on this radio station, man. Where we're not, we're not just in the world of SESSAWID. SQUATS! I want to blame Terrence for that whole Scott Junior episode. I don't want to get out of here for the weekend before I really just rip him in an ass. Okay. No, seriously, it's his fault. Yeah. I mean, it's nice to get by paycheck on time since that's the only reason I'm really here. But we just needed somebody. He was not, you know, but he's not, he's just let it ride. You know, it's not satisfactory. It's unacceptable in this place really to let somebody just drop the balls. That's what the B-SET. He dropped the balls right on the floor. Not good, Terrence. Butch up a little bit sweetheart. I know in your case it ain't easy, but give it a shot. Dickie. WQ, WQ, WAM. Oh, yes sir. Yeah, respond to the guy about the eBay TV. Right? James start to palp TV. It's a one? Pal, it's a poster. Well, that's right. It's the pal format because it's in your vets at good point and he won't be able to watch it. There you go. Thanks, pal. That's not. Felicia, he's like, great. You're breaking up. Probably got a pal phone. I didn't know there was such a thing as a pal format TV. You know, I had that beautiful TV that low TV and answered in, but that's a great set. Yeah. But I didn't know that the TVs are like an F format. I know that the VCRs are. Huh? I don't know anything about it. Yeah, you do because you know that I have a VCR that's like both. It goes both ways. They see a DC. Oh, but I mean like you. I didn't know that the TVs were out. I don't know. I don't know. But did anybody that probably been about 100 pieces? Not a word. Don't do it. We're begging you. Don't do it pal. You're a young guy. You got your whole life ahead of you. I know. It's just a 20-year-old face to 20. Why do you best it? First it was a hit on MGD. Then a number one movie. Now it's coming to Broadway. It's Jackass, the Musical starring Johnny Knoxville. Hello. Johnny, spread your cheeks. Johnny, it's so fun to come to right there in the boots. Yes, all those risky stunts. Have them combined with fabulous showtunes to create Jackass, the Musical. Wow. The music. The dancing. The guy eating a yellow snowcoat. It was better than cats. 76 dumb guys. Pac-Yum-O-O-Pars. 76 eyed. It's phasomeness. Don't miss Jackass the Musical. With all your favorite Jackass's on stage, singing torch songs, then setting their hair on fire with them. I'm Steve O. I'm just breaking local. I'm hurting myself to it. A great white way has just turned black and blue. Thanks to Jackass, the Musical. 556WQM, you'll be amazed when I announce to you. Okay. That I am fully clued. Wow. I have on my shirt my pantalones, my socks, my shoes. My hair is brushed neatly. I have all of my spritzes under my arm. I'm on my list. Good. Thanks for not telling me the silver. For me, I look good considering the best it's I can do. Yeah. In other words, when it comes to a clock, I'm ready to fly out that door. In fact, you'll be able to hear me sing in all the way down there. I am truly a loser now. But I remember when nine bars are lies. And you know something else I'll bring in my phone right now. Can you hear it? Hold the pant here. Hold the bottom. Real comedians, man. Trust me what I tell you. I am truly a loser now. Okay. Just come down back in the box. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon, wireless line WQAM. I think you know how you doing. Pretty good? Well, got to kind of call for a while. You'd be instead of my friend in the Reapest customer. And here's how it's supposed to work from your right now. I can barely hear this call or a McGill. How about now? Much better. All right. You've been set up a little bit. It's called a repetitive business. The way it's supposed to work. When it comes to your inspection, you're from the Goa Man look for the dropping on a black light. You look for the urine track. Seal your house. Then you can use the peanut butter in the trap. When they put the peanut butter in the trap, first, right in the trap, then you'll seal your house and then no catch the ones that are in there. But then they're going to find the way back in there because they know where that peanut butter was. And you're going to have to call them back again and do the thing. Over and over again. How are they going to get back in there if they really seal up right? No, fine the way. Don't take whole ridges of your concrete. They go through concrete. They go through concrete. And they do as they seal your house with that foaming agent like that one collar said. And then eventually they'll eat right through that. They will be giving it and they'll eat right through that. They'll eat this insulation and the airing is things up. They'll try a little bit of way. Right back to where they knew that snow was. I think it's time to call in the rat patrol myself. Second, for your poor, I've been trying to get through to. I don't know his name. I think it'll rival. Who is that tube in the attorney and in Miami? It's called Lobin's Problem with the Green Tea Geno. The Modesaule Sanchez. Ramona, Saul Sanchez. He needs to get that and get it out for them. Yeah, he needs to get back to those beautiful hotels in Ivana. And for your poor, Jose Casico Lizard Tampa and Wife and Kittard Lizard Miami. Okay. He's got a house there though. Yeah, his wife has a house there. And he's constantly in jail there. But okay, I have a great day, pal. We're getting him out. When in Dove, toro, him out. And he's got a street in there from somewhere in Miami, Lake's just someplace. A Florida court park. Big place. It's where? In Florida, of Coral Park, high school. Wow, he's in there. And then that embarrassing one. What a great role model for the kids there. A cropped park high school. Wow. Oh, of course if they were getting any trouble, he can always protect him with his piece. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pond. That thing would have a guy talking about the raskin man. Then it sounded promising to that. No, I know what he was talking about. They can see all your house first. Then they put the bait. Did you see? Did you see? He was in the house. He was in the house. I don't see that cruise bound on Oceo house. Oh, he hasn't hit. Yeah. Now, what were you going to say is very important. I'm sorry. He made a good voice that I hadn't thought of before. If you don't see the house up first and then put the traps on there, then you have the situation that you have right now that you're just drawing in rats from the hood. Like you've been saying it. Yeah, but he's saying that even in other words, after we're once they put the peanut put it in there, we're going to smell it. Even after they take the traps out, they might as well as possible. It's possible. Or he's going to remember where the peanut butter was. I don't think they're that smart. That's why I'm even smarter than most of our salespeople. I prefer to defer to experts. Do you mean the experts that are like charging me per rat that they killed? The ones that don't. Oh, by the way, is our friends at ATM? You're probably talking to a handless and I have no problem with that. I think they're the best. I think they're great ATM. I'm just going to turn my management and pest control. Never let me down. Well, I'm just going to give a one more chance because today's today is supposed to be C. Cruising my house. And just really lock everything up real real tight. I don't want to play a bunch of boss and I haven't mentioned him on a year before. Maybe I did just in passing. I was caught with a big critter, which isn't a real name anyway. I like the critters. I like to see all those critters. Could be some people in my who would like to have them for lunch. And you can have them. No charge. Thank you. Okay. Well, we'll see Monday will give you a report. Find out what that happens in my attic. Jesus. God, all my. Something to Florida. Man, if I need to boofo toads is the rats. Right? Right. I mean, so we got a little mad cow up here. And we have a little SARS problem and a little West Nile virus. And we had the attainted beef. And we have the electric power outage. You know, there's no place to run. No place to hide. You know what I'm talking about? No. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the eight. No real paradise. The mad dogs coming along. Mess two to four. He's going to be whipped up into my friends. He and anticipation of this season. And on Sunday, in a course in anticipation to have it work with the mole monster, the humper from the Crystal Palace and Bahamas at full. Bye. Bye. I'm going to go watch your show. I'm five six. I'm going to do it. I'm going to go watch your show. I'm five six. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.
