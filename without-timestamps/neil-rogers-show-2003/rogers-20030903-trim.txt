He knows everything I was laying on his Castro is what I heard it was unbelievable so you're forgetting many saying again Alberto Clemente I like putting it seriously right here on Pittsburgh even though it is a horse All I love the pirates listen there might be a lot of pirates, but I think the closest player to Roberto Clemente That I can see in this day and age is gym admins. He's the best player in baseball He don't look like every single man. He doesn't but he doesn't shave So at least he looks a little bit like a baseball player Probably one of the ugliest guys that are played a game John Summer the law I'm once a week I'm feeling same and better in ZT snow on the angels when they had that big year and then they took it the end of the season Sam can never stay how can a baby You have me when I went on my time.

Absolutely. Let's fry for next couple of ones. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. It sounds pretty inviting to me. Here's a flash from Louis West Hill Ray. It says goodbye Paul Hill. I'll be with the Vitt for Book of Brian. Goodbye Paul Hill. You piece of crap. That's what it says here. Piece of crap. I don't normally care for the death penalty. In this case, I'll be having your cake party out of the death of the hippie critical Nazi inbretskombaga abortion, the doctor killer at 6pm. I'll also murder the doctors and then go to the wife, right? Set no the um, his driver. Well, what does driver begin with a W? Well, it just ends. I mean, Louis West Hill Ray just to any gutsy emotional. Thank you, Louis Del Ray. I'm with you, man. Bottoms up. There's another fact. This is cute. David Carl Springs. This goes to show you the kind of newspapers you got there in South Florida. They sucked their garbage. I would even wrap my garbage in it. Being insult to the garbage of the world. I would even put those logs in it. David Carl Springs spacts as me an article. Well, it says in here, you mentioned on the area, state of the public, wouldn't know the difference between Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and former Senator Bob Kerry of Nebraska. Evidently, the Sun Sentinel didn't either. Below is an article in Friday Sun Sentinel, detailing Senator John Kerry's economic plan with a picture. Here it is right here. A former Senator Bob Kerry of Nebraska. I called the Sentinel to point out the ear. They printed the correct picture in the Saturday paper. Thought you get kick out of this. Yeah, absolutely. David Carl Springs. Thank you. Democrat of presidential hopeful John Kerry on Thursday, proposed yad yad yad yad and here right next right in the inset is a picture of Bob Kerry of Nebraska, which anybody would even a minimum of intelligence with a modicum of political awareness. Anybody with an IQ larger than their thumbnail size would know the difference between John Kerry, who's that got that real crusty look, you know, right kind of boring look like a dead in Kerry and makes those goofy face. And Jim Kerry, but a goofy faces, who used to look pretty good, by the way. And Bob Kerry, who looks a little like how do you do the on helium. I mean, I mean, what, what do we talk about here? Oh, look at this. And here, and he also on the bottom of his face, I didn't realize this. It says, curabder corrections and clarifications with nobody reads. And article on page 12 A. A Friday's edition of Democratic presidential, full Senator John Kerry, was accompanied by an incorrect photograph and read his the correct photo of Kerry. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Nice going, David Carl Springs, you're okay in our book. Lot's sharper than those assholes of the Sun symbol. Isn't that the place where Tom Jicki used to work? That's the work. And the reason I say used is because on their website, the last article, Eddie wrote was July 29, then he was off in California, California, getting wind and dying by all the TV promoters, all those assholes out there. And then that's it. But on the one because I'm here at Toronto, I'm supposed to be out of touch. I've found thought of touch this time. Okay, touch most bald spot. Maybe you could borrow most peace. Wouldn't Tom look lovely with that. Let's go down to sit with that weasel. He has a spare. No. I'm sure he does and a spare tire too. More sex abuse charges filed against upstate evangelists before we didn't get to the days pool, which is already up there. It was. I'll be damned. I guess I work. Huh? I came back. What do you mean by that? For some reason it reset. It reset. Well that's good so I can vote for it again. We got I'd like today's pool a lot. I started out with like two or three choices. And then more I thought about it. I thought this is really a nifty. Anyway, we'll get to that when we get around with. The first Anderson South Carolina, more sex abuse charges filed against upstate evangelists and upstate evangelists accused of sexually abusing children has been charged with 13 more counsels, and connection with crimes against for it can kill the youths fully said. James Wesley McCoy, 31 of bath South Carolina, has been charged with three counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor and 10 counts of a lude act upon a minor. The warrants were mailed and served to McCoy at the O'Connie County jail. Love what a bunch of mugwams. And you like it there in the car. I know not South Carolina. I know it. Where he's been held since May 12th said it can share spokesman Lieutenant Michael Frank. The additional charges stem from incidents against forfeitants in achon Frank said in fact I hear they're still achon. In May McCoy was charged with committing sex acts with 13 and 14 year old girls. Nice gone pops. Upstate evangelist McCoy who has McCoy ministries based in green to list charged with sex abuse in five South Carolina counties achon, Kursha, Lawrence, Okony and Pickens. That's when the Pickens is what he said so he had a girl for the 13 and 14 year old. That's just tragic pathetic shame on you pops. You pervert here's another one. I didn't realize just out of the blue came all of the stuff. Fist pouring in an effects machine. By the way did I read that so I Christian radio employee charged with child pornography from the American Family Association more than 500 times the end. I don't know. We'll get back to it. A cues that abuse preachers on leave the remnant. This is in Tampa. Oh my god. Are you ready for that as it's starting to sink a little closer to home and you know what we say about that? That's right. Another month. You notice? Well, of course we shouldn't be surprised by this but the places where there are more and more mugwams this seems to be. Although we can make the exception father gig and who's still dead. That was in Boston a lot of the stuff in Boston which is hardly known as a mugwum place. That's terrible tragedy. What is that? I don't know. Oh, you mean father gig and oh yeah. Oh yeah. Poor father gig and won't see him no more. He's like Paulie and the godfather won't see him no more. I tried to stay with the straight face. It was only accidentally to realize that he was left with that guy who was abused as a child. And why didn't he get even that skin head? That was just a coincidence that the regards happen to be dittling around out in the airport yard while he got off while he got strangled and gagged and choked on it. They're bad. Choked on his father. You piece of turd you. You turd. Tampa. The Reverend Timothy Kelly and assistant pastor at St. Timothy Catholic Church in Tampa to voluntary leave last week while the DIC's investigates an allegation that he molested a boy 20 years ago. Kelly 56 couldn't be reached for comet but he denied the allegations Sunday and a statement to parishioners. Somebody who's been a friend of mine has falsely occured me misconduct with him when he was a minor. They're everything to defend my innocence and help the DIC's come to the truth he be saying. Neither Kelly nor the DIC's identified his accuser but the allegations were outlined in the lawsuit filed in the Penelas Pasco Circuit Court last Friday. Ah, y'all y'all y'all until 82 Kelly was a pre-thal DIC's a buffalo. Well that's enough to make you one do anything. There he befriended an altar boy identified in the suit as John Doe and other altar boy, Cain Ovell man. What a novel concept. John Doe developed a close relationship with Kelly like that a father and son. Kelly took John Doe to baseball games and movies even bottom Christmas gifts. According to the suit Kelly we look at an 82 to the DIC's St. Petersburg which encompasses the Tampa Gate Bay Area. In August 1983 the suit says he brought John Doe and his brother to Florida for a week long vacation at which time he performed all sex on John Doe who was then all of 13. This queen did a kid 13. The abuse caused permanent psychological damage loss of income loss of faith the suit says John Doe repressed memories of the odds of molestation until September 9th, it doesn't say but prompted the memories to return her Florida stench of limitation to require the suit to be found within four years which ended Monday. The DIC's of Buffalo and St. Petersburg both defendants of the suit as his Kelly, the St. Petersburg DIC's already has a compelling defense that its attorney, Joe DeVito, and no kind of Danny, lame-y-p-p- he might be his little brother. But don't step on it. Danny DeVito's great. Yes. He was great in Noah was the what the hell? A Hoffa right? You didn't see that? No. He was great in that movie. He was like Jimmy's little, I don't want to say bodyguard but like his little lemon. You know he always put with him much kind of sidekick. And then he got conned there by the, by the punk at the end. I was watching it. Something like that. I needed to watch Hoffa. Oh my god, it's great. Did they offer Hoffa? They offered Hoffa. Yeah. And then he was in the trunk and vanished and they said, oh he won't see him. No more. He's kind of like Father Gagan. What's he him? No more. He's with all the big scumbags in the sky. Right where Paul Hill is going to be after six o'clock tonight. It'll give us a thrill to see Paul Hill get the pill on blueberry. Anyway, that's it's good. It's a wonderful thing. And then I'll be saying, well, you know, this, there might be a backlash and some of these other crazy assholes are going to start to do an abortion clinic and all the other, well, what is going on here, man? Crazy religious people. Those are the dangerous ones. Okay, when somebody starts giving you the God bull crap in the Jesus' baloney, at that time run like Helen call 911. That's the first thing you ought to do. Are your kids out there? Run away from home if they try to give you the religious brainwashing and all you portorthox Jewish kids immediately. File lawsuit for parental malpractice. What do you say? That's a good idea. 1041 at 560 WQM.

Thank you, Larry. 1047 at 560 and under how things are going in California. Fifty three quotes already we haven't even officially started a port yet. That's a good almond or to think. Yeah. That's a good old man. Anyway before that we got nineteen thousand four hundred dollars for abandoned pepper rescue the best of me. You'll stuff. Go to our website or to your CDs and keychains and stuff. And mugs and wonder mugs. Teashearts. And they're more Howard David and asshole keychains. It'll be a wonderful thing. Probably be a collector's item after they finally Schmidt came out of the building because you're never here to him again. Nineteenth thousand four hundred bucks. That's what we got so far. We're just getting going. And just wait till actually some people come back to town and you'll see some action. You know what? I had no before I do the full thing. I'm serious when when is it now I realize every year more and more people rise up and they spend a little time there is possible especially when it's raining and humid and hurricanes come in and hurricane. But but what's the story already? I don't know. What is the deal? How many more weeks before some people come back? Jesus that's like a more than half of the year. I think basically there are people there like the Sember January February and March. That's it. And a little bit of April and they get out. Right? Sure. What kind of a place is that? It's like it's like a horse and buggy town. How long can that place continue calling itself a major market to get 10,000 people who are baseball game Allegedly. That's what they put in the bus going to paper which means they were like five or six thousand people. They're when they got their top superstar young picture on a mound when they're like tied for a wild car. And they were leading by again going to the game last night. And there's nothing going on. Nobody wants to be there. That's not a major metropolitan market. Like a world class. Like you're saying? It's a stopping point. It's a dropping off the face of a map point even if people in Beaumont North Carolina don't want to go or say whatever it is. Be referred. Go for it. Go for it. I don't want to just get that out of there. Yep. That's why I took that pull the other day. What's the biggest problem? Too many Cubans. Well, I think we need to bring in there. I haven't said for years. Bring in a whole bunch of buses. Bring in a fleet of buses. Thousands of them. And just take a hold. We have incoming and outgoing. And we need a people transplant and South Florida. I mean, the weather we can't do anything about. Especially with this president because pretty soon it'll be 140 a degrees in December up north. But we can't do nothing about that. But it sure is how it will be a lot more pleasant if we had pleasant people. If we had some progressive leadership. If we had some real newspapers. If we had some real broadcasters on TV and the post of a bunch of silly clowns like Angela Ray, laughing up her ass. Jesus, God. And like Elliott Rodriguez with his professional Cuban isimo crap. We're tired of that crap. We want some real people in there. We want to have some people under the age of 100, which I know is illegal. Wouldn't that be a tremendous novelty? Oh, no. We got to get rid of spring break. There's too many young punk's here, man. There's too many people drinking beer. We rather have a bunch of old people popping the pills and pretending to be driving out there and creating drive throughs in buildings where there isn't any. That's what we'd rather have. That whole South beats thing, man. What a joke. What age joke, you know, it would be like a band-aid on a gigantic tumor. Put in a little tiny band-aid on a Titanic. You got a few blocks down there on South Beach, where Dekko this and Dekko that. And what I wish I had that thing on Barbara Kappen. You got the carpet. I don't want to hear it. Okay. No, I don't know. Because it makes me think of her yellow teeth. Go ahead around the show one time when she was screaming against casino gambling. Oh, our Dekko. She was one of the leaders for this Dekko thing. She's long since dead. But I'm sure she's just laughing up her ass and the box. See, I told you we don't need gambling. We've got Dekko. We've got the South Beach. Yeah, like 10 blocks. 10 blocks. But about to scream in Queens running around there. You've got to have muscled by on screaming Queens in a body and muscled shirts over Placed restaurants with a lot of really cheesy places. A lot of really cheesy guys. And I do mean he's he and she's he. And then you got Miss Drogdown here. I wonder if Ann Colter's like living in the same building. Think. Say, Rob. You think they're rubbing their strap on together? They've both got a strap on. So that's our pull question today. We should do a thing. I like when when how does anybody come in back? Okay. Oh, not doing that today. But I'm serious. We ought to do that. I mean, it's it's getting frightening to me now because you just you see it. But it's like a ghost town this summer time. And you have to contend with it, which I shop this summer. George, if I do say so myself. All by a key. No, it was it was it. And I'm not not me not great. It was fairly weak. But no, it's certainly a good job. And we'll do that pull next week after the ride is finally comes back. I mean, you know, after things start coming around. Well, no, we're putting the pieces together. You officially hear it on this show. The other guys on the stage, we got some good guys. But you know, they talk crap. You know, ball games this and ball games that, you know, and they just, you slide on by. You know, like all the other stuff. They're, they're oblivious to it. Because of course, they're there to talk. That's right. That's all it's all about. Much of stupid ball games. Then nobody cares about. That's why for Rellis going over so big because he mixes in a little tiny bit of. What about your dirty crap? You know, we like that. You ought to watch the other bunch of dirty crap. There you go. And we have one here about this one's package and this one's rack. And the big D. I racky packages. Exactly. So anyway, here's our pull question today. Which of these, and I got to change one, Eric. I hate to do this because I know his back is illin. But I left the word out. It wasn't his, it wasn't his bad. It was mine because it doesn't make any sense. Although it's still already getting votes. Which of these would be the most humiliating to be discovered as a cross dress here, which we talked yesterday about guys who were bras and panties and like to wear it. And evidently it's fairly common. Straight guys. Okay. That's what Ray Perry told me. Oh, I see. To fart on an elevator. Now see, I could have, we could have done a whole pull just on the different categories of where you would fart. Right. Sure. But I'm not going to do that. We'll do that another time. Because you could clarify that you could like narrow it down. If you fart on elevator, there's only two people on there and you're one of them. Right. Well, guess what? The other person knows they didn't do it. I think it's implied. No, not necessarily if you fart on a crowded elevator, it's pretty embarrassing too, because that's true, but then let's say yeah. But then you can never be here. Oh, and see, the secret to that is they're like if you're standing online at publics. I know. And there's about six people online like at the express line and you fart real bad. And the thing is, you look around like when I just said like, oh, she's looking at that. Oh, my God. And that's the only way to protect yourself. I like to look at the old lady. Of course, they might have seen that stain in the back of your pants. They have a pretty good idea of might have been you. That's the other question. To be discovered as a cross-dresser, to fart in an elevator, to be a straight guy and see the word caught needs to be in there. To be a straight guy caught having sex with another guy. Without the word caught, I mean, you could have sex with another guy. If nobody knows it, it's not that humiliating because you probably enjoy it. You know what I mean? You're probably like getting a little homerwider on your cell phone. But to be a straight guy caught having sex with another guy. So we need the word caught in there. And it's not going to fit online. So I'm not how I'll do it. But I have to go over it. Okay, just relax. To be discovered as a pedophile, which already is rambling for the top spot, to fart during sex, which I was reading a column about that the other day is very, very common. This is the most common cause. What ever happened to them by the way, common cause? Who? Common cause. Don't you remember the organization? The political organization common cause? You don't? No. But you're an idiot. Anyway, this is the most common cause of like the quickest interruptus. Is one partner or farts. And like that kind of like, no, no. Damn, damn it's the whole scene and the she's living. But it's never pain. Okay, next choice. We got several choices on a pool. You poop your pants in public, which is almost in first place. Mom, I voted for. I voted for something like that. I did too. I did too because I've done that. I poop my pants. Although I never poop my pants or not, anybody else thank goodness. I'm trying to take a number of times. I'm not. Now, the one time in a car doesn't count because I was alone in the car. Remember I told you I just right. I was almost told but I knew it was hopeless. Pointed over here and so I figured, well, what's the, I'll get let it go. I let it all out. And the worst part of that is when you get into the garage. Thank goodness, I got, you know, the, the, what's your call of door, you know? We're more controlled door. And you go inside and you close the door and make sure nobody can get in. And then you get up and all of a sudden, like Lincoln logs are on your shoes. None of the ground. It's very embarrassing. In my beautiful corvette to a, I traded that car and we'll see how bad. Like I think later that day. Very premature evacue, if that ejaculate, Gortskort. I mean, and we underlined a very part. You know what I mean? I did. Especially like those young punk, you know, the first time they're doing about three strokes in the Gortskortz, it's a pretty reverse. I didn't print it. You pop a big Woody in public. I mean, it's obviously visible. Or you pick up what turns out to be a shemail. Which you didn't think was all that embarrassing. I can't imagine few things worse. I mean, what a, what a blow to your ego. What a blow to your ego. I mean, embarrassing wouldn't be the word I would choose. Press trading, aggravating. Now, humiliating. First of all, the poll doesn't say embarrassing if you read it. And secondly, it's humiliating. I think it is humiliating. It's degrading like, oh, my God. That that's what I'm on up with. That's the best I could do. Is this? Whatever the thing is, the shihi. You'd be saying, you would be saying, T, he if it was the shihi, I'll guarantee that somebody else might. So that's what we got. We got a lot of votes in there already. It's a sensational poll. We're going to got 100 votes. I haven't even like this. Put out. 1057 at 560 WQM and, you know, TriceDraper. We love you. You're a good guy. Old number 23. But you are so full of cramp. He takes last year's copy again. He crosses it out like it's a joke. 9, 3, 2002. And he puts 9, 3, 0, 3 today's date. I mean, this is our sales department folks. So when you hear for real and everybody else in Hank, bitching about our sales department, it's not stick man. There are assholes. They just don't want to do any work. Anyway, here's the deal on balance for life. There's no assholes over there. Just people that really know their stuff inside and out. How many lose the weight?

That's nothing but a chemical feast. Good, delicious fresh goodies. They have three gourmet meals and two delicious snacks in your black sack. They deliver right your doorstep by six an AM every day. And of course, it's based on the zone dive by Dr. Barry Sears. Remember Dr. Sears? I think he was kind of Jay and the Brian Sears. And robot. And man, you will love it because like I said, the food is delicious. And there's plenty of it. Not periquete size portions. So if you're tired, if you try it all the other way, plus programs and you still a fat slab. And you're like diabetic around the verge of it. No fun.

My life and load this is for trivial life. You wait, you wait. You wait. I got a terrible job. I got a terrible job. I got a terrible job. Hey there, this here's Bill Flynn. Now you all heard about the national do not call list. That stuff's telemarketers from Buggin' Yet Home. Well now there's a little list that blocks another kind of unwaver call. Oh my god. Hold on. Hello. Hi Bill. I was reading the names of grass and I had to call you. I miss you. It's my journey, Bill. I thought I told you not to call when you're a child. Yeah, all who's on the phone. I do not want the switch to MCI. Come back. Yeah, that was close. Thankfully, calls like that will be a thing of the past when you put your name on the national. You do not call when my wife is homeless. It's guaranteed to block calls from all sorts of businesses. Like fat interns, ugly interns, jigs of big noses, jigs of big butts, jigs of big butts and big noses. That's the ball. When your wife leaves the house, those calls are automatically put through. I'm going to a book signing. Poor. The national do not call when my wife is homeless. Because your affairs are your own affairs. I did not have phone relations with that woman. Since then, I got what that was. I'm going to go 3 to 5, 60 W to Q AM. Let's take a call or two showing. Because I got a lot of stuff here. We got to go to our hurry. All right. Because it's hump Wednesday and we got that big comedy that's one to two hours. That one ain't never going away. Good. We like it a lot. But that other stuff that that's taken our way through. That was bad. You know, we don't apologize for it doing. No. We enjoyed it. It's probably enjoyed it too because what else are you going to listen to a bunch of crap? Here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Are you doing today? Great. I'm doing great. Hey, I was hoping you could do me a favor. Maybe. Please retire. You're doing different voice today, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Different voice. She's trying to new tactic. Here's a Delray Beach. Delray. Delray is up here. I'm on the bench. Just wait. I don't want to forget that guy there. They're going to call everyone for the loudest life paid on. Hold for about 20 minutes to say that. Probably. I just want to do a thing. The same guy that calls everybody. He's using his real voice now. I think it's more classy. Yeah. I want to get on the pole there to play it through this fun edges. And you're right. Put her pattern around. Put Shawn. What got in here? Hard on. Hard on. Public is probably the number one thing is. But the worst is if you're in a swim. If you get a hard on. If you're what? And a swim. And you get a hard on. Really? Okay. He's got a big hard on. Yeah. And you stand up in the swim. Rather embarrassing. Oh my god. What a guy next to me. He's often a gold girlfriend before the. You know, the meat. A little excited. Rather embarrassing when they say I'm laying down. I will think here. I'm going to march. Fits. Yeah. They used to say Mark Spits and Eddie Swallows. 567.0.560. Tom. Now, can you tell me something? Because I don't know anything about gymnastics. Other than most of Marguei and most of them are like, well, not about some are pretty good looking. Not only gayer than the divers though. No, not even close. No, but, but seriously. What I wonder is when you see guys like, like, do in the what do they call those things? But the rings. They call it. Not that kind of range. The rings. The rings. And like they're. And they always seems like they have something protruding there. You know, like they have a gigantic killboss in their party. I noticed that. I think they wear a a padded piece. A cod piece. Yes. Yes indeed. He's a little bit more. He's got a big hard on one of the other for his questions. Oh, let's go back to those days when we had who were the barc cars? And not Matt LaPansy. He was married to all of the other than John. He was in that cute movie. You know, I'm talking about misgator. Okay. misgator. That's not much of other queens. There was one year man when the US Olympic team was just, wow. Well, like a bunch of male models. And they all, uh, he's got a big hard on it. Yeah. They all had like that. Pompies. Yeah. What was that? Artists 12 inches. Oh, I thought we were going to hear that interview with Moe and a cheerleader. So we're going to get that. We have, uh, not the ability to play it right off if you know what I mean. But we have seen our people working on it. We'll have it momentarily. The worst, for us is the worst interview in the history of radio. The most embarrassing humiliating and degrading. See, I was thinking that might also be another choice. We're not going to put it on your Eric. Please. We're not going to put it on. And you know, it's how quick Eric made the change on that thing and didn't have to go to the next line. Like lightning. Nice going Eric. See, I should probably feel good about Eric doing such a great job lately. I really feel bad. You want to know why? Why, no. Because no, because what it shows is that for a couple of years, they were holding back on us. See what I mean? Remember, he's got the ability to be like as phenomenal on that website as anybody in the universe. But he was like, uh, slacken off, you know? Okay. And so now we realize his true abilities that, you know, so he owes us big time. And he's catching up. Hi, job Eric. Which of these would be most humiliating? 129 votes? I was also, I started a second and put on there being caught listening to the more Howard David show. But you know, that's just a good tool to keep shot. Which we do easily enjoyed doing. Which of these would be the most humiliating to poop your pants in public 39? Can be discovered as a pedophile 35? To pick up what? See, I firmly believe that pedophiles need to be institutionalized for life. Okay. There's no cure for pedophiles. So why do they keep putting them back on a street and then it's like, Oh, gee, we just can't believe they did it again. Well, that's, that's their thing. See, and we just aren't accepted. No, we just don't accept their thing. The tall wall, they need to be on the other side of it. Exactly. Forever. Now, what do they ever decide about John Hinkley? Did they make that to Zignus to your neck? Because I didn't see the story. Don't know. I thought they were going to decide. Well, we'll get to it. Let's get back to the poll. Let's get to the important stuff. Okay, because this is one of my better polls. 138 votes, which of these would be most humiliating, putting your pants in public 42 to be discovered as a pedophile 38 to pick up what turns out to be a female 20. See George. Ha ha. How do you like that? Oh, what? It's humiliating. That's not the word I would think of. And as of respecting guy, I would say, Well, I can't put humiliating and burasing the grading this appointee. You know, it's, uh, Jesus, for a guy that puts up crappy polls like you do. You're someone to, you know, to be picking on this. To be a straight back on having sex with another guy, 16 to fart during sex, 11. Have a very premature ejaculation, George Court, six. Like before you even get it out of your pants is not an idea. Uh, to fart on an elevator, too, to pop a big woody in public appear. And to be discovered as a cross versus only got one, you see? That cross dress and thing is not as unpopular as we thought. No, wouldn't surprise me if a large percentage of the so on. The body is a, we're in guys were in bras and on these right now. Probably out of the cab drivers. It's probably comfortable, you know? It's luxurious man. I'd explain a lot. Oh, yeah. Which is why sometimes you see guys like rubbing their breasts. Uh, who the hell was talking about it the other day? Oh, Joe Rose. It was great. Nice gone, Joe. About the fact that he's when he takes a shirt off as he's, because he's used to exercise a lot. And he stopped, right? And so now he's got like large breasts. He was complaining about the fact that he's got a large breasts. So now, Clarence, there's something for you to think about. Joe might get a little bit out of sorts, but if the beast, you know, just continue turning it down. The next time the little dog is in the building, Clarence might consider grabbing little, some handful of that. Edphletite and the breast, too. So there's our pull question, which I like tremendously. I think it's sensational. It's right on top of it. See, the pooping and a pants thing. I started with the story. Let me take a call or two because I got many poop stories. You know, it's how we went from toilets yesterday to poop stories today. This show is rooting in a crapper. Here's Miami, hello. Let's go, K. Let's go, K. Yeah, go far soon, please. Here is, uh, am I sure, hello. Hey, don't worry. Okay, sir. Hey, don't want to, uh, how much contributed to a band-empet rescue? Yeah. I have a really great idea. I want to be one of your voices like about 30, man. And I think if we, if you put up like you've been to, I'm always, you've been to that voice. You've had your voice. I'll start the did right now for $200 for me to have that voice. So you pick a few of your voices. There's no clearers in the church. You know, one of those. And we're good on it. And whoever with the highest bid, you use that voice. Now, there we go. You've got back in the third. I have a question. You're talking about what you made you a bit on the voice. What it was that mean? Well, I, what I mean is it's that. My voice to be about 30, man. I'll be with you for a while. It's hard with this voice. Oh, no, no, no, no chance of that. No chance of that. Let me say again, there is not a 10 or 10. I mean, how could you replace 30, man? You can't replace that. You're replaceable. And it's your replaceable. It's worth $400 for that. People are so want to say that voice. Now, 30, man. Well, how about if you just send a three or four hundred bucks with big Google to get? Yeah. I know. Let's just say I did. Okay, bad one. Thank you. I won't take this. See, if somebody really wants to donate three or four hundred bucks, they'll do it. Right? No, no, go through a whole bunch of stuff. That maybe we'll do it.

I get it about a one on a scale 5,000, but he was in it. And during, at least he's consistent. He may not be a good actor or anything else. He was pretty good, the gymnast. But one thing we can always say about Mitch Gailard. He's got a big hard on. He's got a cod piece in his pants. Yay. Well, it's probably like to attract the young on sand.

See, it's a damn good thing I got all this stuff because I already built out that beautiful poll today, which is getting a humongous response. But other than the building, the poll thing, they just, you know, there's nothing there. Which is astonishing to me. Even a 25 different categories, the 70 categories we got on the poll. Oh, don't inspire. We had the one guy that was talking about swimmers, you know, getting a pop and wood in their pants. Right. Which I imagine would be mighty embarrassing. You're standing up there on the diving board right before the, right before your hold your big meat. And all of a sudden. And of course, a lot of those guys. See, that's why they always look straight ahead. See, they would tell you that they want to be caught. No, they would tell you that they want to concentrate and wait till they hear the start, you know, on your bark and said, all of that, that has nothing to do with it. They don't want to look around because if they see some of you at a guy's next to them, you've got all you know, something. But especially bad when you climb up out of the water and your suits all clingy. I see everyone sees. Oh, now you know who that's going to be online. I think we might do like call us Wednesday today. You might just have to do that. Maybe my psychic powers are paying off. But as I have better powers than we've on guiding light, I've got just a whole Pollock good stuff. Which I don't really do with that much anymore because people don't want to hear me reading stuff on a year. You know, they get very, uh, and see what they, some of us like it. Yeah, I'm sure you do. Here's Miami. Hello. How you doing, Neil? Okay, sir. Come from Miami. I just turned 58. Hello. It's not Reverend Jones. Why does he always say, think everybody's that Reverend Jones guy? You don't sound a, it's Reverend Jones. You're right. I'll talk a few extra words for me because it takes like an extra half a second to get here. Right. There's a delay. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. But we're getting nothing but idiots, including that guy with the, uh, what we have here is a failure to get rid of the crappy colors. Of course, when you only have one, and you know, it's going to be that, uh, goofball again online 9. See, because nobody in Pepper Pines calls online 9 Scott. I understand. You understand? Yes. All right. And I realize we can't be Tuesday because there's nobody else online right now. But nobody in Pepper Pines is going to call line 9. So you know what's got to be that jerk ball because he figures that somebody's going to get on. And he's not on too long. Have a fine. Hello. There's him. See. So we're not going to get no calls today, which is okay. Doesn't bother me at all because most of you're called suck anyway. Not going to get any women calling today. No. Does that got no sense of humor? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. People just do screenless the rest of the day. Go on a clock. What do you think? Oh, I got a little vacation there. Then Scott can pay a little more attention to like some other things like those and they could picture you got on the wall. Things like that. By the way, did I read that article Christian radio employee charge with child pornography enough yet? Got this hour? Not enough. We'll get to it this hour. Here's the Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Hollywood. Are you in Hollywood, sir? I am, sir. Okay. Good. I'm checking. I got to tell you, some of us will more pale than any other sports athletes. Yeah. What do you think about that? I don't. You don't think? No. Swimmers are a bunch of faggots, man. It's not the ones I know. Swimmers are all fags. Swimmers' divers. Yeah. Uh, guys, uh, bodybuilders, like Arnold, or all bunch of fags. Well, divers are definitely fags enough. Right. And what about the gymnasts? Uh, absolutely fags. Huh? Absolutely homo. I mean, even his name was Mitch Gaye, Lord. But I'd tell you, right? Put him up, Baltimore. He sure was pretty though. I'll tell you that. That was, uh, those, uh, uh, uh, gymnasts. Yeah, get tongue-tongued just there. Go, actually, was like all in one year.

I better speak night. I don't think she's there anymore anyway. In fact, did you make him, did you make a woman in my bank? Well, I don't want to go in there. Because they're kind of finally straight in the racked out for a little while. Yeah. Well, why? I've got all this stuff and I'm not doing it because I'm getting, I'm sucking myself into like Ron's Jeremy into like taking phone calls. No, it's bad. It's a stupid thing. These people have nothing to say. Like some miracle happened during the summertime and all of the studies people are, I mean, even the stuff that we have on this poll, they should engender. You say that should stimulate. I have a lot of God conversation. But I'm like me who's the honest guy that tells you a story's about. I put my pants in a hotel and roam and I put my pants in a car in a Corvette on the way home one day. I mean, these things happen. You know, Schmidt happens literally. You pop the Woody while you were swimming naked with your schoolmates. Yeah, five times. Oh, and we'll say this. I was speaking to Woody. So I mean, with me, you would never notice. You couldn't tell. You couldn't tell. I know what you're laughing about. You couldn't tell. If it was one skinned out of shorts, you couldn't tell. You didn't have your, so fat when you were a kid that you had a man. Giant, I did you. Anyway, there was a kid named Bob with a spoon who was in my high school class in Canada, when New York at Canada day, where academy. I was obsessed. I was obsessed with a lot of you guys in my high school class. Had some good looking. A lot of all white people in the Canada day. That's why so many of them were good looking. I'm sorry. That's in Jews too, right? Two. I didn't maybe half a dozen. I would stop side tracking. Bob with a spoon wasn't Jewish, but anyway, he was hot. Okay. So, Bob with a spoon along with like 20 or 30 other guys. Bob, third man. And one day we're in a home room. Is that what they call a home room? No, no, no, no, no. What do they call it in between class? And between class? No, no, but I'm talking about the study. Home study, what does study call? Yeah. The bell rings, time to get up and go to class and some with next month. And Bob with a spoon isn't like in the aisle next to me. It gets up and I see in his pants. Holy, Toledo, I thought somebody stuck their hockey stick in there. I thought he was on his way to baseball practice and he was bat in his pants. The loonies. And of course, when a guy gets up like that, he walks very stiffly. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, no pun intended. As in stiffler, yeah, he was very stiff. It's hard. And he walks. I just sat there just when my jaw was done to my toenails. I couldn't believe it. I said, holy Toledo. And then Rick, we've restored a line for me. God, all might I'll never forget that is on. I'd, you know how many years ago that was talking about. I haven't remember you're important things. See to me, that is important. Yeah, that's very important. Let's see, I would have been in 1958. I want to say. So that's 42, that's 45 years ago. I remember Bob with this pun's E-reption from 45 years ago. I guarantee he don't remember it. I'd be like that. But I do because it was like a turning point in my life. I took a turn for the worst. What grade was that? What grade was it? I was like a sophomore in high school. Or maybe a junior. I remember things were earlier than that. Huh? No, I don't say. I don't remember. I don't remember things from earlier than that. It might have been a junior. Get the funny junior. That's what I was trying to do. But move too fast, even with that problem in his pants. Anyway, I just mentioned that. But there's all these other ones on here. And you would think, and of course, nobody in this audience is going to call in and say, oh, yeah, well, I was, I'm married now. But I was caught with an encounter with another guy, like in a tea room somewhere. Nobody's going to call in and say that. But everybody's going to recognize their voice. They'll go home and get an nasty divorce. They'll get slapped over and over to baseball that. And that'll be the end of that. And then we'll get blamed for it. We'll put them through the shredder if they call. Because one thing we've discovered, you want to like to fat stuff. This audience lies on the earth. One of the very few people who had met the foibles, you know, with all the, uh, the nestly turtle ice cream. You see, these people are so much better than we are, so much whole year than we are. They'll so much more on a straight and narrow path. You know, they're full of crap. I seen most of you people. You're fat. You're disgusting. I think it's a great idea that I am, which is saying a lot. Right. You're doing drugs and cheating too. Right. But all know, not these upstanding folks. Here's Fort Lauderdale, huh? Hello, Neil.

Right? That was good. There's a lot of punch down by some bull-dike. Can I go to the KDR and the Colvas? Can you imagine, Jenner, we know we're taking a swing. I'd like to see her take a swing at Sister Jean. I'd like to see the two of them get in with her. She's going with Sister Jean. Yeah. What? Twenty-two known at five, sixty, WQM and the stop board is in a coma again. Oh, boy, how's sad? How a very sad. By the way, the answer to phone Scott, no screenless. Why? Okay.

See, I don't care about football. I do like the Patriots a lot. I learned right. Shouldn't say I don't care about. I do. But just not to the extent that you lose your net play scare about these things. It's not important anymore. In fact, as you get older, you realize there's only two important things in life. Okay. And I don't want to hear about friends and love. I mean, you know, all of those, that's fine. Money in sex, in either order, whichever, you know, that's it. That's all that's all that's all. That's important. As you go, and you get to be an old fart like me, you realize that's all accounts.

Gee, what sort of looking for? Oh, hypocrite. That could be. Wonderful. As far as your pole goes, I would need all the bug choice except for the pedophile and the in-cold and sickle guy thing because I've come pretty much guilty of all these including the almost picking up a shemail which I almost did once. Now wait, you're guilty of all these? You're a pedophile? No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, I see. No, except for that in the sex with the... Oh, okay. Because I almost picked up a shemail a couple of years ago. I'll be damned. I was that I'm barring down in water down and I turned out to be a lesbian bar and I was talking to this chick and I'm like, okay, she's hot and I'm staring at her, you know, crack. And she turns around and I'm like, oh nice. But and then she turns around again. I'm still staring at that area and I'm like, oh my god. Oh my god. Exactly. Oh yeah. Wait a minute. Oh, we're supposed to have that. Oh. Yeah. Yeah, that kind of is a bull kill. Oh, thank goodness you discovered it just before you got her hands home. Oh, yeah. And arrested it too. Mm-hmm.

Maybe we want to run off the road. Maybe we want to move to Canada. Thanks for the good news, pal. Okay. See, they're trying. They're trying hard. Oh, that's good. What do you mean? The effort. I didn't know we appreciate the effort. We don't want to think that we don't reward the effort with the tremendous pat on a back and don't ever call us again.

Last summer. Okay. I was a young. I was a quick question for George. I'm the he mentioned the movie that made irreversible damage to him. And I've been trying to be reversible. It's called irreversible. Yeah. That's probably why he said it did irreversible damage. I could be making a rash judgment there, but it sounds to me like. Yeah. You got a rash about it from the tune. Whatever you do, don't get it. Don't watch it. Oh, it's not for the disease. Start for life. What's this? It's not irreversible. Right. For poor young. Okay. That's the end of this conversation.

Because I love where the Torne Q made me. I'm just going to ignore him. To be discovered is a pedophile 59. I hope he's not in a way we do that one. To be a straight guy caught having sex with another guy 35. To pick up what turns out to be a female 34. Although Scott probably would enjoy it. To fart during sex 25. That's an old brainer for him. To have a very premature ejaculation 14. To fart on an elevator seven. To be discovered is a crash dresser five and a pop a big woody in public. Only three. Which for some of us is impossibility. So it's one less thing to worry about. What do what is this story? Is he on doggy upwards again? What? Is he got all serious supply for today? Is he to the compass get it? Have a nice day.

I'll take your word for it. Yes, trust you. You already know. Christian, radio employee charged for child pornography. I didn't read in the last hour. She should be well-wiplashed. She should be blonde and cordured. Tupel a Mississippi. A 47-year-old Tupel a man was being held in half a million dollars bond through his day last week after his arrest at a position of child pornography. Tupel a police detective Tim Tate said carried Wayne Stevens was arrested a week ago today last Wednesday after a raid on Steven's home in Tupel by police and FBI agents. Because the investigators ongoing take to climb to comment on what initiated the search warrant or what materials were seized from Steven's home. They did confirm that the threes found pornographic digital pictures of children. Steven's end employee of the Tupel-O based American Family Association faces up to 20 years in prison of convicted. For the past three years, Stevens has worked on the production staff for American Family Radio, which operates more than 140 radio stations in 29 states. Patrick Vaughn, general counsel for the AFA, said the FBI notified the Association of Stevens arrest last Wednesday, but no action has been taken regarding Stevens and Plym with the AFA, where praying for Dwayne and his family bond said any incident as a reminder of the destructive nature of pornography. AFA has been identified against pornography since 1979 because pornography is so destructive to individuals families and societies said, we like to remind everyone that they need to be on guard against pornography's addictive lure. There you go American Family Association, and the interesting part about this is this to me is a major major story. Because we're on to them, we've had our experiences with a Florida Family Association and the American Family Association. All these people want to drive everybody off the earth, including yours, truly anybody that might say crap. We even take one. Yeah, they're a whole year that all arrest of us, okay, but come to fight out just like Jim and Tammy Fay, just like Jimmy Swagger, just like Charles Keating, just like all of these other fakeers, man, or a bunch of snake-roll salesmen. There are a bunch of freaking hypocrites. Just like the Catholic Church, just like the Pope, think of more skeletons rattling around to God name cousin, then you'll find in a morgue. Absolutely. I'm a separable. So we just mentioned that in passing for the 20th or 30th time. Meanwhile, yes Scott, back at the ranch. Scott's a colonial. Yes, I'm breaking news. Yes, I have a Mohour bit here. Arthur, we're going to see you pooped in your pain. Okay, let's hear it. All right, did that fire it. Let's roll it. Oh, he doesn't know which butter press yet. Oh. Well, look, good news is he's got it there. The bad news is he doesn't know how to plant. Here comes. 178 to WQM. Absolutely. Howard David Steve Goldstein. QAM. Yeah. Paul is just perfect because I don't care who's calling Rick wait for us. I was at a waiting on the lines. I don't care who's calling. That's what anybody's called because we have a kicky in Amber from the dolphin cheerleaders squad. Now, Amber's a vet. She's been on the squad for years. So she's probably 78 years old, right? Oh, yes. She was real. Maybe now, 24, 25. That's it. You did. You started when you was 17 as a cheerleader. Is that legal? Did you go to school? I went to high school. I was going to high school. You had to be 18 by the first game. So I turned 18 in May. Really? I was going to get a kicky in the NFL. You got to stand up at functions and sing around the modna. You got to like, shut the bands. You got to like, you know, did the go for stuff. You don't have to do any of that when you're cheerleader. No, no. You wouldn't anyway. I wouldn't do any of that. You get a case of the two. What did you say? I'm not carrying that. How are you? I'm pretty much, yeah. I need a strong woman. Here's the question I asked. Like that. Early on this morning, we know you're going to have you ladies in the house. Like at the end of the preseason game. Does nobody in the stands support court. Nobody cares. If you just want to go for it. Why continue to cheer and go on ponds and on what are why? What's up with that? You can't hear on your team. You don't know what their game's over. Nobody cares. In the game at that point. Why are you still announcing the game? Men at that point. Because I have to get all they have to do is they're job. I know what do you do with the same enthusiasm. Like a drinking season game. Definitely. You're talking about the world. If they win, it can be. It does. It does. They don't care about the season. I made a statement earlier. And gold he wasn't sure because he hasn't been all over the place. But I think the top and cheerlead is as a group. Probably the hottest group that there is in the NFL. True false. I would like to think so. You said all the sports. Well, all the sports. Some of those basketball dance teams come on now. Well, the heat girls are pretty good. The heat girls are very good. No way. You got something to say. It's fine. You think the heat girl. We don't compete with the home team. You don't compete with the home team. You don't compete with the home team. You don't compete with the home team. You don't compete with the home team. You don't compete with the home team. You don't compete with the home team. You don't compete with the home team.

Jesus, Kate Christen. And he's wondering why he's got a point nine share and for us got a 9.1 in the 6 to 10 segments. Point nine for Mo 9.1 for Farell to combine for us at 10 points. Now this is a fancy dish. Seriously, is that the most terminal thing you ever heard in your life? What? I'm sorry. Exactly. I just got back. Here's a fact that says this is for the chicks. Walking out in public and probably noticing that you have red stains on your white pants as in that time of the month. Or a guy who's in a party and comes out of a make out session and annoying we show the guest list that he just got his wings. I saw many years ago. Oh man. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's that's embarrassing. Yeah. Okay, that's good. But we're not adding anything else to the poll. These people are never saying that we have no advantage. But way worse. Right. Oh, no mother could be like a whole bunch of these. But third man. And I think we got more than that. Yeah. But the whole just fine. Independent review urge over x priest murder. But this is just what is about father Gagan. Who shared the part of the prison with Joseph Drew's 37 who's sitting in life sentence for a 1988 killing of a man who was almost sexual. Through stuck into Gagan's cell, gender, cheper me inside. And methodically killed as victim and a protective custody, why that was being watched only by one guard who was busy eating lunch officials said. And just coincidentally looking that the way for a very long time. Hey, look at that. Our response was right. Yes. I'm not seeing bastard. Nice gone. Speaking of Nazi bastards, Paul Hills going to die tonight at 6 p.m. Which we say, yeah, another good, another good moment. It's a happy day. Paul Hills never let any doubt about his feelings on the subject of killing abortion doctors. He was all for it. This is in the Washington Post. Justifiable homicide to protect unborn children. He called it. He made his case so often on television talk shows in the newspaper interviews. They became one of the leading voices in support of Michael Griffin, the chemical plant worker who committed the nation's first abortion clinic murder in Pensacola, Florida in 1993. It's kind of a Florida-ephan thing, you know. Three months after Griffin's life sentence for murder in 1994, he'll run from commentator to killer. He fired a 12 gauge pump action shotgun to a pickup truck. Outside the ladies' pumpkin Pensacola, killing physicians John B. Britain 69, and security escort James H. Barrett 74. He'll now 49 and so unrepentant that he said that he would kill again, a scheduled dive by injection tonight. Six o'clock tonight, by the way, sit your clocks. Sity alarm for party time for the double murder. Varring a stay, he'd be the first person you asked history to put to that for killing an abortion provider. And of course, knowing Governor Jab, you think there's going to be a stay for this son of a bitch? No. Finally, we can agree with something on Jab about, you know what I'm saying? Finally, goes to show you, to throw enough crap up in the air. Speaking of pure plan, that seclusion of the Florida State Prison in Stark is drug new attention to the extremist groups that advocate violence to stop abortion that is sending pulses of anxiety to the nation's 450 abortion clinics. You can smell it. Extra security precautions being put into place at claims today, and anticipation of a possible backlash from some radical anti-abortion activists inspired by Hill, who has been labeled a murder and a two American hero on websites run by groups such as the Millet and Army of God. It conducted a group interview today on the eve of his execution, smiling and appearing, composed and footage of the prolonged session of the Northern Florida Prison. I expected great reward in Heaven Hill said, I'm looking forward to glory. Hold. I don't feel remorse. People have asked me if I would do it again. If I was putting a similar circumsize, I believe it would act similarly. Well, eight that great. Huh? I say, let's deep fry him. Okay. Let me ask you something. In batter. Because you guys are shared death threats here and everything like that. If you ever decide to engage a security escort like this guy had, like the abortion doctor had, and they said a 74 year old guy. Because the guy is, he's, he didn't see what I'm saying. A 74 year old body. Oh, a lot of thing I was 24. I mean, you know, it's kind of hard to be a security guard when somebody is, you know what I'm saying? But how effective is a 74 year old son? But on the other hand, at least a 74 year old guy lived long-forged life. A 74 year old guy would have died in a 40 year old age, or a waste of a young life. What can you do with it? Just died behind him? Plus the 24 year old guy might look pretty good too. Johnny Depp, who still looks pretty good, says US is like a stupid puppy. Absolutely correct. In Berlin. My good-class personal friend, Holly was star Johnny Depp said today. The US was a stupid aggressive puppy and would not live there. Not the US until it's interesting. Because I'm not there, so I can say would not live there until a political time had changed. The 40 year old actor, who stars in the power to the Kirby and told the German news magazine Stern, he was happier staying in the South of France with his wife, the French actress, and singer Vanessa Paradise and their two children. He said he spends a lot of time in Paradise. America's dumb, it's like a dumb puppy that has big teeth that can bite and hurt you aggressively. My daughter is for my boy is one. I'd like to see them America. I'd like them to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigated little check it out, get this feeling and get out. Check it out, get this feeling and get out. So the star of the offbeat films, Edward Siserham's and Deadman, and of course, no forget it's wood. Depp slammed George W. Bush's administration for its criticism of French opposition to the US war in Iraq. I was ecstatic they renamed French fries as freedom fries. Grown men and women in positions of power in the US government showing themselves as idiots he told Stern. Always like that Johnny Depp. Hey, Scott and Johnny. What did I tell you about him? He's a good kid. Yes he is. Like him a lot. River Phoenix don't like him too much anymore, but that's, you know, his own doing. He wasn't responsible for it. You think? No. And even if he was. Although he knew, now was a Johnny Depp that was like busted up motels and stuff right. He went through that phase, you know. I forgot. No, seriously Johnny had a little bit of a phase there. A little bit of a problem. I'm sure he paid for it. Good man. No Johnny Depp. We loved Johnny Depp on his show. No one. He's dead. He's 40 years old. Do you know how depressing that is? So let's say if he's 40, he was on my show on set in 87. So that's 1360 year. That means he was 24. What was I just getting through said about body guards? Red AIDS. What did I get? 24. My psychic powers once again. No, no, no, no. Absolutely shocking. 24 is a good age. Yeah. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. So for anything. I mean, the guys girls. Hmm. She's, he's, he's, he's, Animal. Animals. 24 is a damn good age. Do you know what? I've just seen I wonder what the oldest dog ever was. That's a good question. Because little dogs him was like 18 or 20. I'm sure they're like, I really don't think. I don't think so. They're getting us booked unless to have a record somewhere. Yeah, let's find out.

You just sent me about the first new US Roman Catholic University in 40 years. Opened to Naples Florida. Do you know how old that story is? How many months old that? About third man. I mean, just open. But we knew about that. Yeah, in Naples. I'm a Maria University of the nation's first new Roman Catholic University in four decades. Opened to day with a mass attended by the 101 students at its temporary campus. This is over in Naples Florida. On a west coast of Rory, a gavers are. The University was established by Domino's piece in a water domino's sucks so bad. Domino's pizza found her Thomas and Monahan, who devoted himself to Roman Catholic consistency sold a pizza chain in 1998. And his pizza sucks. It blows. It's an extraordinarily exciting day because it's a combination of a year long effort. University president Nicholas J. Healy said in a relation to Maple Leaf, former gold tender and now broadcast to Glenn Healy. It's a very satisfying achievement. Classes of the New York neighborhood. The name of the North Naples. That goes on about this crap. Bob Clatt. No relation to hockey player Trent Clatt. A 19 year old sophomore who transferred to the College of DuPage of Glen Ilano, Illinois City. First heard of I.M. Maria University. I was profiled in the cover of a Catholic magazine. I thought, wow, this is everything I wanted. Clatt said he's not put up by the small student body. Archived for those small student bodies, man. Priest probably like it. Easy to molest a small student body. Then a big, butch macho student body. I'd beg when you think. 560560 pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon. Who might take a couple more calls before one or clock? One or two hour come out of its big. It's humongous. It's growing like topsy. We got your marriage to two. The Humper is in the studio. How many weeks has it been since Hank that he showed in that studio? About 30 minutes. Well, God Almighty has been in Vegas. He's been on vacation. This man is on a perpetual vacation. And it's still getting paid the same for like doing a couple hours today. Some days want to. Yeah. He's got a softer deal than I got. Man, softer what? Something. Taked between 4 and 630. Ever to one two soft when he was out there in Vegas, man. He's probably getting some serious action. You can even end the cut action. He was getting it. Well, almost. 4 to 630 the Humper show 630. We got Marlon's on deck. Let's get a few people in that fogging. I mean, I don't really give a flying crap about the Marlon's. You know that about baseball in general, but I'm embarrassed and humiliated and haven't lived a long time nearly. About 3 to man. Years in that town. To see the way, I mean, this team is surprised everybody. It kicked ass. They're tied for a wild car lead in the National League. And there's 10,000 people to see Don Trevula slash that. And you want it to go. You've lost a couple of games. You got blown out. And wow, we don't carry. Plus there's nobody there. I'm sitting here, busted. I don't know how we had such a good show yesterday. That was an admiration. I think a lot of calls, if you recall. Oh, that's right. No, seriously. There's nobody there. When they held in. I don't want this business. Well, why did they come back? That is a good question, but not for a pull. Why would anybody in their right mind come back unless they positively had do? I don't know. What is Paul Hill in Pensacola floor? Yeah. Right. That's where he was. Oh, yeah. Why am I? I'm embarrassed. Because I was actually watching the Wolf Blitz Creek on CNN. I don't watch CNN or MSNBC. Maybe three minutes a week. Hops. I watched the CDC and the BBC and CFTO and City Post. I get some real quick news. And then I go on the internet. Don't forget that great website. I found what was it. Internet in put. Will you show up? Internet in Patelle's news wise. Yeah. I asked what was it. Those are a total question. I was asking myself. Because I didn't figure you wrote it down. Internet in Patelle's news wire. Really good stuff. For those of you with a brain who don't believe all the furry tells in the bullcrap, who realize that someday we're all going to die. And there's no heaven. And there's no hell. And there's no god. And there's no angels. And there's no bullcrap. And there's no purgatory. You want to close this thing to hell. You people in South Florida believe me. Just look around. You're in it. You're like a furnace. Like a furnace. Like a steamy furnace man. Don't forget on you young kids out there. The skippin school today. Listen to that show and it's a good choice. The religious people are the dangerous people. And if you have parents that try to like drag you to church to show any of that crap. Just tell them. Bug off. Lunatic. You asshole. Leave me alone. I'm going to sue you ask for parental malpractice. That's what you ought to tell them. And I still say the fact that those Orthodox Jews are putting those schmothas on the kids make it. They can go to school like a bunch of little freaks. It makes me want to cry. It makes me want to shed a tear or two or three. How you going to hide the devil hoard to doubt that thing. Seriously. Well, what kind of crap is that if you want to do that isn't adult when you've already made your own choice of fairy tales from the amino of ATUZ, a one from Colombe and one from Colombe Z. Whatever. But don't force your kids to do that. But this is what happens to the world because they start start brainwashing them at the earliest possible. It just like an M will be dogma with Vin and the map. Yeah. Vin and Matt. You know, he is really bent out like his really annoying now. Yeah. I used to like him a little bit. Not a lot. Oh, you were the one. You're not saying I liked him a lot. But he was in a couple of humovies. The one with Sandra Bullock that thing and Chicago were as a nature. Right. He was in a couple of humovies. But generally speaking, he's now really annoying. And at Jalo and Vin. Yeah. He was a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a little bit. He was in a couple of humovies. But generally speaking, he's now really annoying. And at Jalo and Vin. Yeah. And we know the thing never even saw each other naked. I guarantee if you've ever seen a penis in her life, he's a dick. And then she never saw him naked. And in fact, they're there. They're there when they before this big thing with a stripper is now a set of bull crap, which is more balloony to try to convince us how straight he is. They were building this big complex in Atlanta was going to be like a gone with a wind. But that was the name of the thing. The place where the big guy. Right. I thought she was on smallville. But anyway, and then we're going to have like separate houses, which nobody bothered talking about. What's your like about a mile and a half away? That's even better than the separate. Kind of like an Eleanor Franklin Roosevelt. The only difference is that they did it a few times because they had about 50 kids. But then after that, they kind of went their separate ways. There is no way that anybody will ever convince me that Jalo isn't a dick. Okay. With a big fat ass, which you know, guys like not just Cuban guys either. Guys in general like a big fat ass. That's why fat boys get in so much action. And that's why the beast is getting so much lately. Right. So, Clarence said, You said, boy, there's some real heavy duty meat to grab a hold of there. You know what I'm talking about? No. And he was talking about on the ass end by the way. Of course. Oh, see. Oh, this is a great fact from Richard. Since you've come clean, I thought I didn't admit to a poop story myself. Oh, I, you know something. I'm going to tell again my poop story is after the break. Okay. Because this audience here's we finally got one guy that's honest. He says I've had several. One was particularly embarrassing as I was sort of caught. The town I was in college. I'm a way to a softball practice. And the urge hit me. It was a Sunday most buildings were locked. When I got close to the ballfields, I finally found a restroom that was open. But it was too late that image was done. I got under the stall started talking to myself. How could this happen? I can't believe this happened. Well, after I dispose of my underwear and got cleaned up, I realized that someone was in the stall next to me the entire time heard everything I had supposedly said to myself. Now that was embarrassing. And got my vote in a poll. Time. Richard evil. Thank you Richard. Thank you, Dick. Give you high marks. Give you kudos for being one of the few people in that. God forsaken place. That's got the ballfield mitt your human quarters. Okay. That's your human being. Christ. Oh, no, no. Nobody eats big tubs of ice cream like you do. Nobody is a big fat slob. You're the only fat person we know. You're the only one with no self-control. You're right. Right. So for a craft man, it's coming out of your nostrils. At least Dick there. It was coming out of other orphasids. Yeah, there's nothing worse than dry taking a big accident. It'll dump in the orphas. 26 past noon. Or can you imagine some of the people in that building if they did that? Oh, God. Don't make me mad at that. I don't want to start mentioning names. I've got so many gigantic net. Not just fat people, but I mean enormous people. Big huge people bigger than some cities that I know. I have. There you go. Oh. There is one. Wow. I see. I was so lucky that I wasn't there. Did they utilize? I know. We don't want to have an affair with us. What do you mean? We don't know what's in. Who else could have liked them? Well, that's how they found. Not turned mad.

And all the tickets matter out loud. Pupped is on five six get kind of a crappy Wednesday. It seems to be the theme here today and appropriately enough. Yes, they had to be an aberration. Must have been. So how many more weeks we've got to go before anybody comes back in the time? I'm 30 man. Oh, here's lady with a poop store online. Hello. Oh, Neil. I've never told anybody the story before. This is excellent outstanding. Well, I remember when you you cut that cart or they listed that cart when you came in late and Rick and Suds had the wait for you to get in because you pulled your pants. Right. I remember that story. He too. Anyway. I don't think that's how the story went. But I mean, that's okay. I've different my pants. Wasn't it the day before? No, that was the day. You were late coming in and they had to fill in until you got on. Well, George is agreeing with you. You know what? I understand. What? you had two episodes. Why have more than two episodes, believe me? I mean, that I would. Yeah, you had one on the way into work and you were delayed because of it. Oh, I completely blocked that out of my mind. Welcome to your audience. I'm sure they do. Anyway, I worked outside and sometimes I'm not in the general area. Who? You're not in the hood, yeah? No, not in the hood of facilities. And I was out working in the night before. My husband had made a brownie recipe that called for a pound of butter. Oh, oh. So a brownie recipe. A brownie. What did I have for breakfast? Were you fudge back? I don't know. You know, I had a brownie for breakfast. It's a brownie house. Yes. It was my coffee. And I was about five miles from here to facility. Oh, God. I would on a job and I felt the urge. And you know that urge when there's nothing back. No point of return, right? So fortunately, this was kind of far out in the booties. It wasn't in a residential neighborhood. Mm-hmm. I was lucky enough to have a big gulp cup in my truck. And I had to use it. Oh, God. You had a cup in your trunk. Yeah. And yeah. That's how we can help now. Oh, God. That's how I saw them all would do. Well, you know, sometimes you just got to make do with what you do. You got to do what you do here. Unfortunately, I had a change of clothing also, which I'm curious with me. What a great idea. Yeah. And when I finished all that, I had plastic bags that I double bagged. And my underpants and my shorts and everything else. My next stop was a dumpster. And I was going to, I thought you were going to see, left it on your neighbor's, and brush that. It's like fire to it. And that grow. It would have been cute. Well, thanks for being honest. Okay. You've got it out of your system. You're a absolve now. I sure did. We bless you. Thank you. Have a great day. I'll do it again. How do you like that? That's great. How unlaidly like. But at least she had the balls to admit it. We remind that. Oh, holy, holy. Most of you guys out there, bunch of pussy's going to admit it. So let's see, I had the one episode that I don't remember what you're talking about, but I have to take your word for it. I had the one where I was driving home in my beautiful corvette that I referenced before. And I got very close to my house. I was like, I was like, at hiatus and sunrise, just on the others and the south side. And I'm approaching like halfway up the hiatus, which of course you got to drive slow because it's a speed track. That was a bad movement. And I got about halfway down the street. I thought to myself, because all the way from work from about just to turn bike. At that point, it was like pressure was building like the world was coming to win end. And I finally said to myself, who am I kidding? I'm never going to make it home. Right? So rather than city or in strain, have a damn heart attack, you know, or our stroke, try to repress when it's out, let it out. And I did. And then I turned to the rest. I don't want to repeat right. Okay, about my garage. Oh, gee. So that was one other one. Then there was the one. It then he's in Oakland many years ago, many, many years years ago. From, from Oakland to a Frisco, laid it night. I had a flight early in the morning. And I'm driving late at night and I get almost to the denies there. I saw it in the distance. I'm driving across that what do they call it, bridge? I don't know. I don't know. That's just something the cross, B bridge, whatever. I'll see the denies and I'm thinking to myself, oh, my goodness. There's a denies. I can make it. Guess what? I made it all right, right in my pants. Well, actually, I didn't. What I what happened was I got to the parking lot of the denies right and as I walked out for every step. It was an other one now. You know, squirts work, squirts work, squirts work, squirts work, squirts work, squirts work, squirts work, squirts work. So I get in there and with my luck, thank goodness, the rest room is on occupied. If it was occupied, I would have probably had a close. And I sit down and naturally what you do is you have to dispense to the underwear. Okay. Point. And you have to like kind of like bade yourself in the toilet with the toilet paper and the whole thing. They have to like do the best to tidy up. I guess. I hate to be the poor guy that went in the next. I did the best I could to like hide the underwear and the behind the bull. You know, to hold it behind the whole course. And bust, but it's never, never perfect. Poor Jennifer. So that was episode number three. Episode number four, not necessarily in chronological order was in Rome. You know what I say? It went in Rome, do the duty. I had a truck to read. And of course, if the truck to read is in Italy, that would drink a lot of that. I'll come in a rally. You know, trap up. Ha, no seriously. You drink a lot of that bottled water. And the pasta. And of course with me, I have that sensitive stomach with the irritable bowel. And I just a great meal. You know, a great lunch. And I'm walking back to our hotel. And at that point where the leg ran to hotel. A very, very overpriced old, but extravagant hotel. You know, I'm talking about one of those old, old, old, kind of place. And I'm thinking of myself. And I'm going to walk off. And I'm tip to link up the street to the leg ran to hotel. This is really the pressure. My ears are foaming. You could see the steam coming from the ears. I get to the hotel. And I'm thinking, I'm going to make it. And I get on the, and the old, old elevators. The small single elevator. You know, would the thing, and what? I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I'll make it for anymore. What? What the lever? Yeah. Something like that. And it finally comes down. And I get on the elevator. And I press five. I'm on a fifth floor. Okay. And we get to three. And I get to four. And I get to five. And I'm thinking, oh, it's because, because my room is only right down the hall. I'm going to, and I'm going to tip toe to the tool. I've just right out of my room. And I'm going to make it. Sure. I took the first step off the elevator and scored scored scored scored scored scored scored. Or every step I took was scored scored scored scored. Or man. But the good part about that is, I mean, first of all, you got to change your clothing and your hotel, obviously. And second of all, you got your nice shower. You got your bidet. Sure. Right. Good day. If you have a good boy, this is great. Well, at least I made it back to the hotel. So that was number four. I think that's it. Except for the one on the way to work that you don't remember. No, no, I counted that. That's one of the four. The one on the way to work, the one on the way home, the one on the one on the one in the room. So I'm trying to drop my spread it around the world a little bit from the west coast of the west to South Florida all the way to Italy. I don't think I ever, I know the reason I never put my pants in Amsterdam and boy, oh, I want to tell you, I had some closed calls, baby. Woo. I made some close calls because when we had the last department there was like a pretty good thing about a seven or eight minute walk from the tram. Okay. And you know, if you're on your way back home to walk to the apartment and you get off the tram and you got about a seven or eight minute walk and at that point, especially if you just eat the meal at horrible Dutch cuisine. Man, all man and you're like, tip to and and you get to the front door. I never, I never went over the edge. But at that point when you unlock your front door of your apartment and you walk in and you walk in like real gingerly, I mean, tenderly toward that magic room when you're fighting the natural urge that you're brain, the brain is always ahead of your body, the brain says, okay, you're home now. It's okay, loosen up and I don't do it now yet. Not yet. And Jorge, we call that barren shy. Whatever you call that, right? You're like a Yahoo, you know. Yeah. Oh, it's seriously. I mean, so I must have had a half a dozen episodes in Amsterdam where it came with an ace within a heartbeat of like doing the only. Oh, so only four. That's not too bad considering my age considering 100 years old. That's only like one every 25 years. Thank you for coming clean. Sorry, speak. That's what I always say. 20 to one at five, 60 WQM. We got a big one to two hour coming up. I'm going to play some heavy duty crap. I mean, we got to get off this crap talk. Two days in row yesterday we did the total toilets. And today we're doing like, Connor, look, it don't blame me because this is the one they picked out of the list. I got right. Two, four, six, eight, nine categories on there including a she males and pop and woodies and public and very premature calculations with the court. None of these guys are going to admit to that. Not these macho guys. What pop and wood and public? No, no, the premature ejaculation. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, the two, the two pump jumps is somebody I know would say. Some lunatic I know would say in the younger days. That's what I'm saying. Twenty to one is five 60 WQM if you're here is gone if it just down the old drain. You probably feel pretty bad about it because you don't look your best when you have trust me. See, my case, what am I getting a difference? I could have the best hair in the world. I still look like crap, but a lot of you guys out there would at bald spot. You want to look better.

But I think this is a good one because I'm thinking about it. Ben Affleys since we just played that bit. Who is the most boring big name celebrity? Good one. Not a good pole. And I have one A-monner. Guess what it is. Ben Affleck. All right. Good guess. So I'm working on that. We're working on today's pull. We have 384 votes. Which of these would be the most humiliating to poop your pants in public, 122. See, and now when I'm stuck in public. Number of the ones that I'm talking about, thankfully, even though the one was in a hotel when I got off the elevator. It was nobody around. Thank goodness. You know? Right. And the other ones were also in the car or like any of those things. No one in public. So you can always like kind of like sneak away or whatever. Although I will say, and I was late at night. Thank goodness in Denny's in Oakland or Spursco wherever it was because I was like goose stepping. Which is good practice for these days. But I was goose stepping toward the Denny's from the car because every step was score. Scored score. Scored score. Boy, what a horrible horrible feeling. I'd call that duck stepping now. See, anybody at police in God? I've told you many times before. If there was a guard, would anybody ever get diarrhea? No. Constipated? Oh. Oh. Tremend 84 votes to poop your pants in public 122.

It's 21 to fart on an elevator 14 to pop a big Woody in public. 8. And only six for to be discovered is a cross dresser. I told you it's popular man. They like it. They like it. They want to bronze panties right now. Your next appearance you could be handed them out. Brown panties. Brown panties. Well, kids, kids. What were thought about? Brown panties. You're not just a ball of it. I just thought it was color coordinated with the rest of my outfit. Heides and multitude of say Colin Roland Colin Powell or real sell out. It's going to be expensive work. But there we know doubt about it. Listen to the audio on it on CNN. Pretty nice. Secretaries take Colin Powell seeking support today from Britain, France and Germany. See, in the beginning was half, Bob Fungoli. You don't want to go along with us to some of those countries not Britain. And now all of a sudden since they realized, Miss Fudge had a story on her website this morning that the US is only got enough troops till March to continue this insanity and Iraq alone. So that we're now going to have to come on and bend the knee to the UN, which is what Colin is doing right now. Just complaining for the sake of complaining or is this still a leftover residue of, of, yeah. So anyway, a seeking support from Britain, France and Germany and a proposed UN resolution that would give the UN a larger role in Iraq's economic and political future. In other words, bail our ass out. Written over our heads. They got kids dying every day. The top US commander in Iraq today transferred control over parts of these south central zone of the country to an international force led by Poland. That would actually be really good. A step in Washington's campaign to bring more nations to the US led occupation. The post war operation is costing the US about, before I read this paragraph, there are so many, like you said, children, right? Old people, no food, no drugs, living in just horrendous poverty. No drugs. So why are there human conditions in the US? I'm talking about, oh, forget about Iraq. I'm talking about it in the US. And the post war operation is costing the US about $3.9 billion a month. And a strained American military, which has some 140,000 troops stationed there, the Bush administration is struggling to attract broader international participation and sees new UN resolution, which he's peddling right now to make, as the way, to make other nations more comfortable with contributing militarily and financially. In other words, bail us out. Some nations is including India, felt like they needed additional authority from the UN to be able to participate, why does spokesman Scott McClullen said? He's really awful, but he's a little more much of an enlast one. So we said we want to listen to your concerns, we want to work with you, we want to look at ways to encourage broader international participation. But he made play in the US in tense to retain political and military control interact, especially over the oilfield. I'm sorry. So there you go. There's that. Coal in his region. And so I think there are no people who... Don't think he's got much in his mother, then. And of course, if you've been peddling all this shit, he has, you probably have much in your mouth too. This story, love this story. You know, I'd Latin Grammy in South Florida without some big stimulus without a big to do would be absolutely. Yeah, it would just couldn't possibly happen. But this is kind of a twist on what we usually have. Cuban exiles abandoned plans for protested Latin Grammy. Oh, right. Members of the Cuban and this is an ascent symbol, so it's possibly could be true of stir-written by a former Senator Bob Carrier of a message. I mean, Nebraska. Chip Carrier. Members of the Cuban exile organizations that are planning to protest the presence of musicians from the island at the Latin Grammy city yesterday, they would not protest after all. Because musicians from Cuba are unlikely to get visas to one of the U.S., there's no need to protest, said Francisco Garcia Martinez, one of the exile leaders. We had promised that if the Cubans didn't come, we would not protest. He said, we have to remain true to our word. What else would they be protesting about? Is it what I'm saying? Yeah. I mean, this is a story. That's what I'm saying. We don't like people with red hair and America to be any of there, so we're not going to protest people with red hair. I don't get it. Some Cuban exiles will post female cancer, consider the island's musicians to be represented of Cuban's communist government, communist that communist that that's why the NSW group saw to be more than a thousand demonstrators to the word show. Two years ago, the spirit over the protest would be prompted to Latin Academy of RIS and said, right, to move the awards to LA. This then, and of course, they ran into Teresa and Ethan and Gwen in LA and all the passions crowd, and that's getting so boring. This time, I'm in police that they try to avoid conflicts by meeting with all the groups involved Latin Grammy officials and demonstrators. The police also took Latin Grammy officials and the protesters on walkthroughs of the proposed protests sites. Nana goes on and on and on. Garcia Martinez acknowledged that some anti-cancerized Rosemyko had been protested anyway. This is a democratic country, he said, since when? He's in big county, isn't he? A smaller group of Cuban American protesters has a permit to them. I don't understand. What are they demonstrating? Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That group estimated to be about 100 once the demonstrators supported the right of Cuban musicians to participate. I mean, oh, talk about being a dead horse. They're not going to be any their first place. There's no recent man. Well, we're the community. We don't need any more bad publicity. I worldwide TV and a freaking Latin Grammy's okay. Stop it, a guy damn demonstrations. Demonstrate against the fact we got a Nazi administration in control of the country that stole the election right there and floored that something that demonstrated about. It's a guy. Demonstrate about the fact that there are dead kids in Iraq every in Afghanistan every single day. Amir and the bigger part. Kids. What did the was Scott saying something? He said, he's a guy earlier. Oh, I don't pay any attention to him because he's, he's, he's, he's, he's another, another plane. He's strange. He's strange. He's, that's why he's a Scott, the for else friend. Strange. He's strange. There's, there's, there's been laden held some a to plot biological a tell. He's just feeling his way into the show. He's not, he's not comfortable with the show. He's a real sports nerd. He's not an oldest fag talk, which, you know, he's, he's didn't, and crack talk. He ain't, he ain't ever pooped his pants. Actually, I just did. No, no, seriously. Now, I say, no, what does that mean? Why wouldn't you say something so gratuitously in the attic is that? I, I think he's trying to work his way out of another show. He'd be good then, but instead of the beast. What you think? Hey, now. Who wouldn't assume in Scott go back a long time? I hear that pretty tight. It's why I'm here. There've been laden held some a to plot biological attack claims US magazine. This is from these scutnamen. Osama been laden held a terror summit in the Athcan mountain stronghold after the Iraq war to plot in the tech, using biological weapons that will be unbeatable. It was reported yesterday. Unbeatable. Since that meeting, Ben laden has continued to play leadership in planning roles without Kada from a secure hideout. Taliban sources told US News magazine Newsweek. Now you see, we could have been spending those billions of dollars to eradicate Al Kada completely and find his story ass. And we need to take care of finishing up the business net Afghanistan instead of having all the warlords come back and take over again and having a bloodbath all the time. We could have been doing that, but no. Didn't do that. They said, been laden is in good health and joined his time with his two wives when it is thought safe and living out our heavy protection from his loyalists. He recently presided over the funeral of his daughter-in-law who died in childbirth. I had enough riches to enjoy myself like an Arab Sheikh, Ben laden said at the funeral according to his special bodyguard Abu Hamza al-Jaziri. But I decided to fight against those infant elf forces that were to sever us from our Islamic roots. He blamed America for his daughter-in-law's death. Newsweek reported that Ben laden convenes the summit with Middle East and Eastern European terrorist leaders in April to discuss serious projects. His priority is to use biological weapons, a high-ranking teleband source told magazine, saying the organization already had weapons and the only question was how to transport and launch them. Ben laden's three sons, what would he on that show with the front-memory? Sure. I like to early best. Oh, I like whatever his name. I don't know what his name is. No, that was his name. What about his name? Don Grady. Chip. No, he would chip was the moment of glasses. Okay. Don Grady was a chip off the old block, but his name wasn't chip. Okay. Okay. Don Grady. Who was doing now? What's your name, by the way? Not Angie Dickinson? A fair faucet. Did you know that? I did not. Scrunner brains out. That's when she lost them. Ben laden's three sons were always uh, whereby his son, uh, are by a set of swore to kill him rather than let him fall to American hands. According to the sources conducted by a contacted by the magazine by Newsweek, the al-Qaeda leaders developed a communications system that helps him avoid US electronic surveillance. Ben laden communicates with friends using handwritten letters and computer disks, which are liver by a chain of messengers each link in the chain, those only the next person delivered their massive two and does know the final destination. The restroncest special that Ben laden's hiding in the Kunar province in Afghanistan, among this area with plenty of treat cover making it to be called a spottom or his followers location using satellites.

Cecil's find up as a merchant marine and was sent a cuba, where he re-tooled his knikele back, and he came to well and out a Superman that was speaking to the film Godfather too. Little did he know, as he was a boy, Tesslo would rise the power, forcing him to change his act once again. Look how I'm around the tide right around that time, and there was a boy to be no.
