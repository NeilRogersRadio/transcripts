You know speaking about this thing in the man that you keep changing the y-up and pending fund raiser and everything. Yes. Already since we were talking about what we're doing. We're already people are talking about which keychain if we're going to do a keychain. Well, hopefully I'll read this discuss this because I'm sure I know exactly where you're going. Right. He's already said, no. Yeah, but- And in fact, I don't think he was the one that said, no. I think that somebody next did before I actually got back to him. Right. That's what I'm getting at. I think that now maybe that he and I are so tight, right? Those are balls. I think maybe we might just lighten up a little bit. I think it would be criminal if we did a keychain in and it wasn't that. Especially since we're going to raise money for charity again for one of the adorgia charities. Again, who could have a problem with that? And specialist in season dorgall, I've got a dorg right? And he's got that doggy hairpiece? What do you say, Mow? Those are balls. Come on. Huh?

You know, he talked to the powers that people they're scared of him. They're scared. They're scared. I can understand why, but they're afraid that terrified. It's for charity Mow. I know you go along with it. We would do the same for him. Sure. What do we do the same for him? We do something for him. Absolutely. WQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, yo, what's up with you? Gump the bushbook. Whatever that guy says, that cracks me up every time I hear it. Yeah, I'm not really, let me just play it and see exactly what you're saying.

For Chuck, for Charlton-Hethon. He's shot. Gah, actually it's interesting because it says on a... Whoever put this in here, gangster mishporker. Right? Which is how it's always easy to find because I don't know how it's spelled in there. But gangster. Yo, man, what's up with you? Gump the mishporker. So obviously, that was put in nearby. Go ahead. 1056 and 560 QAN. I can move. This is course where you'll find safety. QAN. It's Friday, you first. Okay, come up on 11 o'clock at 560 WCM. Sure, I hope now. You tell Dave that I put him on hold or not. No? See what I mean? Peanutboy, he's like totally out to lunch. You there, Dave? I am. Thank goodness. He's not gonna be patient enough because I have no technical way of picking it up and talking to you in our... ...or a board officer paid to a little actually talk to the people on the phone. So... You know I was here. Anyway, I gotta win or for you this year, Dave. Who is it? I have the winner. Well, don't say who was it. And we're gonna put you on a spot first. I am not picking the truck. I'm through with that game. Bye-bye. I'm out in business. This is the voice of the Kentucky Derby since regret won. It wasn't in 1915. There's a rumor that I was here for the first one in 1875 as not true. No, that wasn't you. That was more Howard David. Who used to watch Ty Cobb a plan as a little child. He enjoyed that so much. Anyway, I'll tell you who I like. Indie and Express the Bobber Horse Written by Timber Bayes. I'm gonna use that horse in my deck as I think he could go right to the front and never look back. But I think he might get caught though. Do you really? Yeah, I like Empire Maker. I think he hasn't won his best race yet. So I think the best is yet to come for that horse. Take an easy route out again. Dave, take an extra six to five in the morning line. I didn't, you know, a rod he was the biggest favorite. So before this horse, and I'm telling you, this horse might even win the triple crown. Out of the 12 hole and a big field. Well, let's see. Let's see. I got a great, I got a great column here from the Boston Globe this morning because I did a little bit of my homework. Yep. And it's all about this horse. And the Express is as expressive here as I'm a fast track and it tells the story about how I feed Pinky Junior. Pick the horse out and turn it Bobbered onto him. And the wildest horse. And you know, this is the wildest story in the Express. I give it 80, there are 30,000 that falls a year registered. And in 2000 there were only 106 registered from the state of Utah. I mean this horse grew up on a tough ranch with rattlesnakes and when coyotes and things. Either tough, either tough mother, I'm telling it. I sure hope he's got a better disposition than Dick Cheney. You know what the honor is? Who is the owner George? The Phil Chass of chess records can mark the head of chess records as the owner of the host. That's right because it's in the story. He's 81 years old and he loves to back. Well, who the hell doesn't? Let's hope we make it the 81th deal. And of course, listen, we allow B.D. do any things for 30, 40 years. Make no mistake about it. I'm going to man. I've read this covered radio, so boy, am I happy? Well, you mean by then? Oh, that's the reason. I want the radio. I understand this. So am I. Of course, I was always on a radio used to be on TV. So one of us is moving in a wrong direction. But when you got that kind of cash day, what if it doesn't make this lap? Yeah, I'll lie all the way to the bank. And I don't worry that, but you probably still had that old. You could probably as an heirloom get that old Howard Kossil hairpiece. Get that on the month, Paul. Huh? I was thinking about this yesterday. You know, we all have our cross-diverer life. I've got no Howard David and you had Howard Kossil. I had Howard Kossil. Boy, he was tough. I'm provoked at one Howard in our life. One too many. So you're picking your stick and with the Empire Maker Jerry Bailey? Right through the triple crown. He's going to win it all. Really? How we've heard this from you before? When? About every year. Every year we had the same conversation. We could put it on tape. And I usually get sucked into doing the same thing. But not this year. Any express written by a 20-year-old Tyler Bayes. He's 18. This is in my story. He's 20. He's 18. You sure you still want him? It says written by Tyler Bayes. A 20-year-old is that, yeah, no, I'm not touching that line. Written by Tyler Bayes. A 20-year-old is never written in the Kentucky, Durby. Now, is he the son of Russell Bayes? No, I think he's a cousin of Gary Bayes. I see. But that's a racing family. A lot of history California. Definitely. A lot of bases out there on a West Coast. Okay. Well, we're going to write these down and we'll do the same thing. But it imagines your 50-granded when on each one. And we'll see who comes out and head the other triple crown. Very good. Have you run into our close personal friend Hank out there yet? I saw him, but we were, we had a bowl of soup together yesterday. And you know, this is just so much fun to come to the Durby. And, and, and talk horses with Hank. Yeah, yeah. And we talked about you. I knew my earl burnin. Those ratings are enormous. I'm glad to hear it. Well, everybody's going to have something big in their life. You know what I'm saying there? Okay. That's a nod to. How big are your burnin? Are you still in Toronto? I'm in Toronto. I'm disease free. Everything is great here. Tell everybody you know to come on up with no problem here. Everybody's happy. Nobody run around with masks. Everything is great. That's great. And believe me, we need the cash. I'll see you at one by in Dave. Okay. Good luck. Talk to you for the greatness. Take care. Thanks. Dave Johnson, great guy. Great race collar. Indian Express. And you saw you had picked the same thing, huh? Yeah, based on on that, because Ken was telling me about that. I was having him help me. Any talking? Ken Alden? Right. Ken Alden? How's Ken doing? He's doing great. It's a lot of happy. Take care of yourself. Ken. Watch your back and add place. Ken Alden, he's a survivor. You know, there's some people or survivors. And there are other people like you know, but a wayside. Not us. Me and Dave Johnson and Ken Alden survivors. Thought me, believe me? No. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Don't let me forget I'm going to read that art. I'm looking at the facts. Is that came over here? Let's see.

Jackson in the Boston Globe. See, everything comes back to Boston. Jerry Williams just died. We got Curtis Raymond, our newest sports sales managers from Boston. At least he worked there for 10 years. And this article from the Boston Globe. As we're trying to present another picture, Teo, while the endless media pepper alley goes on. All the people with the pom-poms out there. It's said that that's what it is. It's an endless pepper alley. It's all spin all day. All good news, man. Everything that we got to play that again. What is that? Stores and strikes? Yeah, it should be in yours, sir. Is it in mind? I think so. Oh, I never knew that. What is? Oh, yeah! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Okay. Defense CEOs are big winners of Iraq War as this article. I'll try to read it even better than I've already yesterday, which won't take much. More than 130 American soldiers died in a dubious war in a dusty or ill-rich land. In dust-free boardrooms the CEOs behind our bombs missiles tanks and planes went to corporate heaven. On the dust, 12 teenagers paid the ultimate sacrifice, in the boardroom men in their 50s and 60s filled their sacks with cash. 12 soldiers will never see 20, at least 13 weapons executive to come more than $20 million in compensation since 2000. The young paid dearly, middle-aged and green CEOs were dearly paid, needed the clouds of dust or the closed doors of the boardroom can hide the bankruptcy. The Boston-based watchdog group United for a fair economy known in general for its reports on the vast pay gap between CEOs and workers. This week published a report on the even more insane gap between soldiers and weapons CEOs. Using federal corporate and think tank data, the group found that while the average army private in Iraq runs about $20,000 a year, the average CEO among the 37 largest publicly traded defense contractors made $577 more money in 2000, $11.3 million in that's the average. Since 2000, the 37 defense contractors CEOs actually given our first strike war, it is more appropriate to refer them as offense contractors, have taken home $1.35 billion. That may not be billgates, but it still means that just 37 men have made enough money in the last three years to for instance pay for two years of running the Boston-Public schools, meanwhile everyone knows how the budget cuts have turned public school systems into their own little bagdads, because a government said there's no more money after war tax cuts corporate giveaways and sports stadiums. In a less predatory America it would be rude to brag about financial winners as a result of the terrorist attacks of $9.11 2000 and the attack on Iraq. Get between Homeland Security and Afghanistan destroying Iraq and rebuilding Iraq, it was hard to tell whether offense contractors were patriotic equals or bouncing volatures. Sacrifice? Not when the 11.3 million dollar average pay of offense industry executives is nearly $4 million more than the average for the largest 365 companies surveyed by businessweek. CEO pay a Lockheed Martin went up from 5.8 million dollars in 2000 to 25.3 million in 2002. It went up a general dynamics tension submarines from 5.7 million in 2001 to 15.2 million in 2002. It went up at Honeywell aircraft from 129 to 45 million in 2002. It went up a North Crafft and Northrop Grumman from 7.3 to 9.2 million in 2002. Paying up at a Lion Bullets and bombs from 1.4 million in 2002 to 10.5 million in 2002. It went up a Cardinal Health Medical Supplies from 2.9 million in 2001 to 17.7 million in 2002. It went up a United Defense Administration's dozen cannons from 794,000 in 2002 to 2.7 million dollars in 2002. At Raytheon missiles and bombs went from 8 million in 2000 to 2.6 million in 2001 and back up to 8.9 million in 2002. In a radio address in May 1940 during the defense buildup party West entry in the WW2, President Roosevelt said, our President emergency in a common sense of decency naked imperative that no new group of warmen in air shall come into being in this nation as a result of the struggles abroad. The American people will not relish the idea of any American citizen growing rich in fat and an emergency of blood and slaughter and human suffering. In the same speech Roosevelt also said, we must make sure in all that we do that to be no breakdown or cancellation of any of the great social gains which we made in these past years. We've carried on an offensive on a broad front against social and economic inequalities and abuses which had made our society weak. That offensive should not be broken down by the pinchers movement of those who would use the present needs of physical military defense to destroy it. Six decades later, Warmillionaires run the country whether that be Vice President Dick Chains Old Connections to Haliburton, for the $13.6 million that Lockheed Martin, North of Grumman, General Dynamics, Wathione and United Technologies have given in political contributions since 2000. Military spending after falling from 320 billion in 1991 to 266 billion in 96 as sort of the $400 billion level. As the Warmillion Air SORE using the majestic patriotic masks of eagles to disguise the ugly voucher waiting for a handout, U.S. is creating a new definition of friendly fire for the budget broadsides in schools, health care and city and state services of every kind. 63 years after Roosevelt's speech, a new group of four millionaires came into being both as a result of America's struggles abroad and its abandonment of the struggle at home.

I have friends to see back in them. We're bedduring. When we got through the salsa party, there were some other priests in the book. Then he dropped his pants and said, Do you good land? Your face I wanted to stop. And I realized now. I didn't do very well. Is he going to stop? The priest couldn't get all so it had to be some sound. I want to go out and go out and go out and go out. Then the priest got the salsa party. Then I made some try again. She didn't in the lay. She took my hand and he said, That's me. He told his try to understand. He said, there's something I must remind you. Before you give it another chance. The holy man who wrote the Bible, Words were in his hands. Now I'm all right now. I can do that very well.

Sure. But you already got enough for the handle. Ha ha. No. April 11th, Kuda Tau linked to US President George W. Bush Dirty Wars team. London's, this is something somebody facts in this morning from a great website. VHeadline.com. A Vener Frelan related this story. London's observer newspaper says the April 11th Kuda Tau against the democratically elected government of President Hugo Shavez, Friass has been linked to US President George W. Bush's team. Specialist in the dirty wars of the 80s encouraged the plotters who tried to top a President in Shavez, writes observable view course upon an edible eammy from New York. The observer has established that the failed coup in Venezuela, with closely tied to senior officials of the US government, they have long histories in the dirty wars of the 80s and least to death squads working in Central America at that time. Oh, this sounds like that thing about Guatemala was talking about just the evidente. See, remember that I did see it. So that will be on the website tomorrow. We got to say it all the time. But speaking anyway of that sausage party, we have played that as we got a couple other stories that were factored in, not that we're looking for these, but they seem to be popping up. These priests stories seem to be popping up all over the place if I can say that. Toledo. A Roman Catholic priest in high school religion teacher was charged with possessing child pornography, the Reven Stephen G. Rogers, no relation, 54 has been on leave since US Custom Service Investigators searched his sleeve at Toledo home in December. The single Calvus file Wednesday this week in US District Court under a legal procedure that does not require a grand jury investigation if convicted, the maximum sentence has five years in prison at a $250,000 fine, the priest did not wish to comment said as attorney. Rogers recently completed a residential therapy program and the Nazis have told they're cooperating with the investigation. He continues to be on leave until this whole issue that's filled with a W. This whole issue is resolved, the U.S. and City is not in the active ministry. Rogers subscribed to a child pornography website from December 23, 1998 to June 27, 2001. The San Desk in A to was ordained in June 1995 and previously served as an associate press, there were a close-on of in Toledo. I didn't like that, otherwise I was a per-free-sand, Prosecutors filed five more felony sex abuse charges against a former Roman Catholic priest after a former alter-born King Ford to say the clerk must have at least a 168 times before he turned 18. But you have a helper. Huh? You get that dump in the clerk? He must have been keeping track of every court or a wall of hashmarks. Yeah, that might be it. Michael Stephen Baker 55, now faces a total of 34 fellow churches. He's already scheduled to stand for a 13-count of Lou Dax upon a child under age 14 and 16-count of oral population with a minor. He must have been in that constorialization oral as moral. Baker was played in a symphony, who counts them from testimony to a preliminary hangout of the church. He said, he said, he said, he was repeatedly abused by Baker in church rectum raise. He said, he abused again when he was seven or eight years old. Baker had a time to comment Wednesday, his arrangement was postponed till May 20, so his lawyer Donald Styer can review the preliminary hearing transcript. Styer said it was unlikely a jury would be swayed by the five new charges. Okay, I just mentioned that in passing and for those who like him young and the son sentle today, two lake worth women charged with having sex parties with young boys. Oh, right. Lake Worth, an elementary school employee and a girl scout worker per month, I wonder if she was selling him cookies. Yeah, thinments. And in fact, that would be a possibility for the Jennifer Remdesirers. How about Candle beat the jater meat? Huh? I don't think? Sure. I mean, that doesn't fit this story. This story is more like one of Lolli-Toff's little boy. But I think Jennifer Remme definitely belongs on our survey today with Candle beat that jater meat. Lake Worth, an elementary school employee and a girl scout worker provided alcohol, watched adult movies and had sex with minors at parties they hosted while one woman's husband was at work authority city yesterday. Amy Duane, a data entry processor at Discovery Key Elementary School West of Lake Worth, was arrested Wednesday charged with loot acts on a child under 16 and providing alcohol to person's other age at 21. Allegations of the Escapade surface that through sheriff's officials learned that Duane 37 and far-up hosted several parties over a four month period at Duane's home. Authorities said the woman provided Bacardi Rumsmer al Vahke and beer to the boys ages 12 to 14 under the condition they abided by Amy's rule. She was concerned they wouldn't get two drum shares post and Paul Miller said of the rule.

From Swiss info, bottom off. Or rum stone, the US secretary Defense was on the board of technology giant ABB, where one of the others reply North Korea would tune up their power plants. SANA website today to store it won't read the whole thing. Weapons experts say waste material from the two reactors could be used for so-called dirty bombs. The Swiss-based ABB on Friday told Swiss info that Rumsfeld was involved with the company early 2000 when an ended a $200 million contract with Pyongyang. The ABB contract was to deliver equivalent services for two nuclear power stations at Kumho, and North Korea's East Coast. Rumsfeld is one of the Bush administration's most stride in the hardliners on North Korea. Was a member of ABB's board between 1990 and February 2001 when he left to take up his current post. Wolfram Aberhardt, a spokesman for ABB, told Swiss info that Rumsfeld was at nearly all the board meetings during his decade-long involvement with the company. However, he declined to indicate whether Rumsfeld was made aware of the nuclear contract with North Korea. This is a good question, but I couldn't comment on that because we never disclosed the protocols of the board meetings ever heard said, maybe this was a discussion point of the board, maybe not. Maybe and maybe not. Huh. Just like maybe dictated, nobody had an all-em deals with Sodam in Iraq, with that butcher of Baghdad. I just mentioned it in passing, and also oil firms work for terrorist sponsors, which challenge giving contracts to Haliburton question. Oil giant Haliburton, and their work in countries considered sponsors of terrorism came under fire Wednesday from California representative to Baltid Henry Waxman, who questioned whether the company should receive look at their government contracts, and later to defense secretary Donald Hermongrring Rumsfeld Waxman said, Haliburton companies of city-ears and joint ventures had dubbed business in Iran, Iraq, and Libya in spite of U.S. sanctions against those countries. It appears that the company is performed in apparently continuing to perform, work for state sponsors of terrorism is being given a prominent role in the administration's war and terrorism Waxman wrote. Waxman's letter did not directly accuse Haliburton of bring law instead of Waxman, asked Rumsfeld whether the White House had examined the legality of Haliburton's work in Iraq, Iran, and Libya. He also asked whether the administration plans to do so before awarding Haliburton any more contracts. And you can read the rest of that story on our website today too. I just mentioned these things in passing, okay? That's what we want to get to heavy duty, do we? Yeah, sure. Sure we do. Because I hate to break the news to you Virginia, but life ain't just one long-earning pep rally, okay? Give the pompoms a rest. Here's a good facts from Jason. This is a voted for about 30, but it looks a man. It's one's off. For example, and I'll pass him by. I mean, the list is getting a little bit long, you know? A little bit. Is it? It's long. Well, they're the fact he also even Jason didn't put this. Only in the banana republic, baby. Only in Miami. Yeah, we've got a million men, it's got some gold. I want a banging in the butt, honey. And then Jason like, oh my god, you're breath, they're beautiful. But I'll leave that to you in the inner boy, okay? Just stand up. That's not even my favorite. What's your favorite? If I'm going to suck on something, it's not going to be an oyster. What about? Who's going to give Ricky a vote? Yeah, there's so many, you know? Well, we got the managed keychain, even though it most of these were not. You know something, let me say this to you. How about managed keychain part two if we can't get the most of who you can't get permission from his highness? That's a good plan, D. I think that's the next one to plan A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. But if we can't get that, we've always got the mad dog. Did he chuck it or did he cock it? See what I'm saying. Here's an excellent thanks from Joe, a real butlkin, one which I always like a little butlkin. While on my adventures across the end of this, it also pisses me off, you write this as soon? Yeah. While on my adventures across the west, I had many occasions to listen to XM radio, satellite radio. I heard such people as Sunny Fox, they've great line, fill Henry, and host of others. Are you sure? I've heard the love doctors from WZCR, they put on a good show by the way they seem to be lacking for callers, either they also have to be fans of yours. But why aren't you on it? XM questioned Joe? You have more talent than the lot of them combined, it says you'd be a sensation on XM, per hat and here I even underlined this, because it just pisses me off. Perhaps you need more aggressive representation. Yeah, maybe if I had an agent, a real lawyer who was more interested in like really to get me where I should be, making me a contender, instead of like a word about his damn, how much weed he's going to smoke at about his house for boys and all that crap. I think he ought to be worried about that, but he's not, he's not going to change. I can read for him, I thought about a contender, instead of I'm pretending to. That's right, never going to be a contender, and I would normally count at the home. And by the way, normal cancer, the same number is Bill O'Riley in the South Florida market a big zero. It says fire that stiffy, I've now and hired yourself a real bulldog and get these things done. So as you may be interested, know that on radio and records, com is an interesting article about arbitrom. Sure, we already know this, they've been doing this for years. It says they're getting minorities more money and incentives than whites to fill out their diaries. Reverse discrimination, question mark, you'll be the judge if you get, but we already know about that, they've been doing that for years. And the reason being, they say that, you know, they have a more difficult time in getting sufficient minority representation. So as a result, they have to have a greater incentive. So instead of two bucks, they're like five or I don't know how much you'd read. How much you think it's up to now? Well, whatever they're given. So they get a much greater return on the ethnic diaries than you do on the cracker diaries. Remember that movie to crack your diaries? Why? Sounds like good title though. Let's make it. Here's an excellent column. You don't want to dig read all the way to want to clock. It's only 1138. Kind of seems like I've been here forever. I've got a couple of more bedtime stories. I definitely know squeeze in here. I get to them. What's your favorite expression or product you got from the new Rogers show? Absolutely correct. Sir is got 71. About 353. No 5.

I hear father or tool like to say that too is what I'm here. But okay. Thanks a lot, Pally. Thank you. Open wide for Chuck. You went up on that on there, but I didn't I mentioned that.

I am the fifth of why from the guy stopped by for a hunger for a hunger. I like guys who started only one is. It's such a good day to go with. Because they kids along from my hunger from my hunger. Big one daddy stickin' in my hand. I gave you a hunger and it all began. You had the biggest one that I ever did to see. It felt the floor when you tried to be. When you earned it, I can't help but more. But it's so big that you just had the floor. You wet my wits and look at big thing, baby. I played down my throat, man. It's as big crazy. Now I think about you and it makes me sad. You went away and never came back. I gave you a hunger and you went back home. But now I can't get much of the size of your home. I still keep in love when you gave me a beat. Now I'm a little bit like Alan B.K. I'm a man too. I knew that you would fit. It really doesn't matter. The size of your stick. New kids along the block really has a lot of time. I need to have no f***ing time. I am just a fly to the sky. Stop by for a hummer for a hummer. 144 or 562 W. I should have asked Dave how come the hummer isn't going to be on today. Speaking of him. I guess he's too busy punching his guts out at the church he'll down. Probably. That's a good reason. I'll be on following the mad dog. Mad dog will be on one to three. Eddie K. from Vegas 3-7 on your gambling on your GA station. Let's just change the colors from WQM to WGA. Gambrows anonymous. Okay.

I want to dedicate that to Miguel and George Corso. Because when I come back, number one I'm not going to give you any advance. One number two I'm going to run around the halls and breathe on everybody. Be afraid. Be very afraid. I mean that thing I still can't get over it. It's so stupid. Just like I'm trying to remember which paper was in so I could click out of it here. I think it was in a son's sentinel. Or I'm not was not in a son's sentinel was in the aglob I believe. About some young girl who came with her family to Toronto. And now it's a suspected sars case. He got a call the sore throat and a cough and now. What's that sars? The family was in Toronto. Is she in a hospital? Is she like that? Is anybody else got it? No. So let me just say this to anybody that comes up here. We want your money, but at least it is now making phenomenal deals to let, you know, entice people to come back after they'd put you to reputation of this city. But don't get it cold. Don't get a sniffle. Don't cough on a plane. Don't look at anybody cross side. Don't get a scratchy throat. Because right away. He'll be sars. Just stop and think about what kind of the endothal assholes you're dealing with in that building. And this was in a meeting. Probably had to put them in apartment head meetings. When you think? I have no idea. Or something like that. Because I know muff was in on it. That's what I'm hearing through the grapevine. Not that we want to get muffled in any trouble. But he's got a solid position out in here. No. He's got a real strong contract. You don't have to worry about things like that. WQAM. Hello. QAM. He died. My phone is ringing. What that means? That means my office applies it downstairs. Another setting? I don't have to go get him. Although it'd be interesting. No. I'm not going to do that. See, I make the call a one day. The next day I got me another case of fast paper. I got me a couple of extra toner cartridges. So we don't have the problem like you got. We have to beg and plead with your was only to come by because the station is too cheap to give a surprise that we need. It's really great. Like like it's like my own little real radio station.

I wonder if I still have that on there. That's traffic and weather. I'm Mark Morgan on sports radio 560. QAM. He didn't do that? No. No. No. Like a normal person. Like a normal person. Like a real traffic and weather guy. That's what I'm supposed to do. That's traffic. I'm spasily Mark Morgan on QAM. You know, it's just what is it to say? What does it to say? I see if we had any real management. Wouldn't you think that one of our people since we've had about 50 PDs and off-smanagers and all these intermediate paper pushes running around? Wouldn't you think somebody would say, hey Mark, you know, if you want to keep doing the traffic on the station, tone it down a little bit. Okay. That's about the problem. It's embarrassing. Boy, you've been out of here a long time. And I'm curious how come that Mo who was so upset with a beast being on professional, what could be more on professional when I just played there, huh? QAM. You know who else used to do that? Who? The big. Oh, remember that one he used to do updates? No. He had the a similar kind of a spastic way of doing that again. Can I make a nice get for the pull? And then the beast started doing that. Remember that? I am the beast. Well, anyway, that's not talk about the beast because he's a overgrown child. He's just a big chubby child. Go ahead. Buh-uh.

You know, so I'll call as we have since you. Where the hell was that Joe and Marks Show last night? No, no. We're up all night waiting for that thing to come on. And the show too. Howl of fame.

We don't want to let Muff. Feel left out. How about. Good. This instant. You know, like that. Sure. Good friend Ken. Oh, look at this. Does it we're publicancyocracy by Ellen Goodman in the Boston low. See, how the way this stuff all seems to come back to Boston even at a little girl that had a cold here to sniffle. Oh, she's got stars. They were Toronto. I'm so nauseous from that. Ellen Goodman says as a certified flat watcher. I look back on a Rick Santorum controversy as the. Comerant of its species. See in the very first sentences got words that we're looking up to. We're. Yeah, the big bird. Oh. It took an enormous amount of energy to achieve a modest lift off and then it flopped unshermoniously back in the political ocean. The flagping began after the Pennsylvania senator offered his comments on the Texas. The way the brickway Mormon sect protested he was punishing polygamous. Meanwhile, the White House kept its lips. Except to say that the senator often described as the original compassionate conservative was an inclusive man. When the air calm, many wondered why nostalgia for segregation had taken down the number one Republican senator to trend a lot. While gay trashing, it less than number three were public and unharmed. But all in all, this was less a flap about homosexuality than about theocracy. San Torm up in another probably ongoing interseeing battle based struggle between what maybe described as the she-out and suly wings that a Republican party, or if you prefer between Taliban Republicans and suburban Republicans. Let's go back to our friend Rick Santorum. Last year, he told a Catholic newspaper that JFK's vow to separate his faith from politics was wrong and is caused much harm in America. Judy Brown of the American Life League, said approvingly, Senator Santorum is a very good example of the Catholic who practices his faith 24 hours a day. He has lived at home on a ghost of the office. This may have a nice holistic green to it, until you remember that this government was found on a separation church in state. And the line has gotten increasingly fuzzy under Bush II. It's not just prayer meetings in the Attorney General's office, it's not just at the insolent education and the rather hebristic assertion that God is on our side in battle. It's on a home front too. A couple of weeks ago there was a flat that the name reached the Santorum altitude. In an article that I Baptist paper titled America's Education Evangelist, Rod Pades, the Secretary of Public Education, expressed his preference for college education. All things being equal I would prefer to have a child in the school where there's a strong appreciation for values, the kind of values that I think are associated with the Christian communities. Nobody said that those who disagree with him, I would offer them my prayers, he said. I know this is what's called playing to the base, but the base is awfully basic, even on fundamentalist. Remember what Jerry Falwell said after 9.11? I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminist and the gays and lesbians, all of them who tried to secularize America, I point to figuring their face and say, you helped this happen, ped Robertson not in his head and agreement. Now, fast-warded list of people have nominated to the theocracy of excuse me the judiciary, among those who are demperilatively moderate his bill prior, Cornell of Amaternity General, nominated the US Court of Appeals for the 11 circuit. The entire not only worked with Robertson to defend student-led prayer in school, he also defended the judge who displayed the 10 commandments in his courthouse. At a public rally he said, God has chosen through a son Jesus Christ this time in this place for all Christians to save our country and save our courts. The same prior wrote in Anamika's brief in Texas, in the Sodomy case that might have indicated by San Term, except for prior's belief that protecting homosexuals would also protect neck or files. How's the hushback in order to name to it? The Taliban are the suburban, and the Republican Party is patched together a coalition of those who want to keep the government out of your pocket, and those who want to put the government in your bedroom. But these theocracy is giving them more trouble than the Democrats. What do you say about a law that lets police break into an apartment in a restaurant for having sex with a wrong person, Tally Ho, Taliban? Before they sent to our flat when flat it runs rubbed some of the compassion-up of conservative, Memo to Rick, a swing voter is not a swinger, Memo to the White House, what happens at the privacy of a home may show up in the privacy of the polling booth? Fighters, local faces, five, six, three, and all yours. I am happy to win! I am fra, Illiano, Rosaladen, and I like rubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels, and listening to the new Roke, a monster hour. Take care! A very popular, disperringed, right through my role. Yeah! For support for support, you sent my entire family up and by. You've been playing this play, me, I don't know which way to go. The strong and the far-backing popper, thanks for the great, rich, just like the popper. To land up the flag of the skies, burn your mouth. Just the punch of punch of burning mud. Oh, go on, it's five, six, did I, but he can never say it right between Illiano and Afid. I like that. Who served in the military from the website, awalbush.com? It's not our website today, we certainly don't have time to go down a whole list, but it is interesting looking at the prominent Democrats, and the prominent Republicans, and to see their distinguished service to their country. For example, prominent Republicans speak for the host any hashtor, devoted to Drakton Sir, former House Majority Leader Dick Army, a vote of the Drakton Sir, House Majority Leader Tom Delay, a vote of the Drakton Sir. He said so many minority youths had volunteered, that there was literally no room for patriotic folks like myself. Oh, my hemorrhage twitch, when I read that. House Majority with bright blunt did not serve, said a majority leader Bill Frist did not serve. Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Laudaj, a vote of the Drakton Sir, but sure, a way to mean pompom, to make he's not around, either we got these, up, cheer of these, a pepperally's going all in time? I mean he's still in the Senate, but he's not the cheerleading at the top. Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld served in the US Navy 54 to 47 as an aviator and flight instructor, served as Reagan Special envoy to the Middle East and met with Saddam Hussein twice, Navy 284. George W. Bush decided that a six-year National Guard commitment really meant four years, still says that he's been the war, huh? It says, question mark. Vice President Cheney servaled a firm in Stolast by marriage and his own words had other priorities than military service. Ah, did you ever hear that as an excuse? Sure, I'm busy. Yeah, I got other priorities. I got another fish to fry. Get lost. Attorney General John Ascroft did not serve, sought to firm into teach business, said it's not was Missouri State. Jeeb Bush Governor Florida did not serve. Oh, always signs a mean building, increased those local phone bills, what will we get to that? Carl Roe avoided the Drakton and served to busy being Republican, says. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich avoided the Drakton Sir? Former President Reagan due to poor eyesight served in a non-combat role, making movies for the Army in Southern California during WWII. He later seems to have confused his role as an actor playing a tail gunner for the real thing. V1 Bob Dornin, avoided Korean work combat duty by the rolling college acting classes, and listed only after the fighting was over in Korea. Phil Graham, avoided the Drakton, not served, had four student deferments. And then, listen, Republicans who did serve distinguished Senator John McCain, silver star, bronze star, Lee's in a merit purple heart, distinguished flying cross, and then it says, why did the Bush campaign swear, smear him so badly? Former Senator Bob Dool, an honorable man who served, and thank you be happy to sign an autograph. Chuck Hagle, two purple hearts in a bronze star, for me and none, and then it's got the prominent Democrats, and listed, and amazingly, most of them represent the Kibharts served as company uniform 65-71. David Bonier served as company uniform 68-72. Senator Tom Dashle served as company uniform 69-72. Bob Keri, Medal of Honor, Vietnam, Daniel Inuit, Medal of Honor World War II. John Keri, silver star, bronze star, would combat, and three awards of the purple heart for a service in combat. Charles Wrangled, bronze star, Korea, and that goes on and on and on. It's, and this is listed as the full chicken-hawk database. I understand whether their expression came from. I like, of course, what it used to be. Right. 560-70560, pound-560 on the AT&T and Verizon-Marvel Slant, Governor Bush sent Bill that could lead to the record-rate increases for local phone service. Legislation that could lead to record-rate increases for local telephone service was passed there, and the government said, oh, right. Governor Huvee, Toto, now do we have an updated store on this sub-beenable, because I put this on the website. I'd hate to put on something that was updated that would be embarrassing, wouldn't it? As far as I know, no. Well, I'll look. I'll look as to put on that updated store would be a no-no. You know? No. Well, kill some time for a second, okay? I'll go to the Sun several times, okay? That's enough. The Governor Huvee, Toto, similar legislation just a year ago, six months before his reelected in his already indicated he would sign the new version, because it gives more 30 to the PSC to control rates. The House passed the measure 93 to 20 to Florida House. The Senate approved the Bill Wednesday, 27 to 12. Consumer groups, including the AARP and Florida Legal Services have opposed the bill containing it doesn't guarantee increased competition, number of increased rates for those who can lease to afford it, such as poor and elderly people who are not willing to be able to afford it. And I think that's the only way to do long-distance calls. How do you like that? Now, it still, this is, it looks to me like the same still story. Florida telephone cretimation prepared to open their wallets, legislators on Thursday gave final approval of the biggest local film rating increase in the state's history and set the measure to the Governor Huvee's expected to sign it. I was thinking maybe there might be an update on it, but that's the update on the Sun's Sun, okay? He'll sign it, because he's not running pre-election right now. Although I understand he got some TV's plans. 560, 5060, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line, WDQA and hello. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You must dial? Now, he missed dial, I'm sorry. How is that possibly missed out, do you believe that? Oh, now he panic, went into a total panic, Chuck. Who was it? He choked. He choked? 560, 5060, pound 560 on the AT&T line, WDQA and hello. Hi, I'd like to speak with Neil, please. Speaking. Hi, Neil. I'm one of your daily listeners. I called in several months ago, and I just wanted to say last night, I don't know how you felt, but when I watched the President get out of it. I didn't watch it. I don't watch it. I don't watch it. I don't watch it. I haven't heard second of it. And I have to say that I refused to, but when he got off that plane, and that uniform holding that helmet, and you know, here he was, a WOL, and then... I see he's trying to make up for that time that he disappeared by way of WOL. Exactly. Well, they say this is all going to be for the political convention, but I just want to let you know that I have read every book that you have recommended from stupid white men to the hunting of the President for Bidding Truth. And last night, I have been so disheartened with the journalist, but in Tom Brokehouse, especially, but last night, he showed Colin Powell sitting there pointing out the five things that they had against some of his things, and then today, as of last night, none of those things that he presented in front of the UN nothing has been presented. So maybe the journalist are coming around, because I think America is waiting for you. No, I don't take so. I don't think so. I hope you're right, but I don't see that at all. Every time I even, because I try to avoid CNN and MSNBC, we don't have Fox here. Thank goodness. Can I try to avoid watching it all, because it gets me so depressed. But every time I do go by the channels, all I see is another puff piece and more flag waving and more patriotic rallies and more isn't as wonderful. Here's another ceremony on a White House lawn. And all I hear is a bunch of so-called journalists just suck it up and endorsing all of it. But the thing is, that's true, but the American people have to begin to see through this. We've got 44 million Americans unemployed. We have 20 something million without helping insurance. Oh, no, I've got bad news for you. What? Scott Peterson's new attorney with a big mustache. Mark Garagos, the professional talking head on Larry King, with a big mustache. Right? He's going to be Scott Peterson's new attorney. I'm sorry, go ahead. Oh, they're gone. I'll just turn on CNN to see what they were showing right now. I said, again, I said, Americans, you can wave all those flags and you do this in that, but when you don't have jobs and you don't have to help insurance, as goes are closing and betterings aren't getting benefits. We cannot be that stupid. I mean, they want to put on the feed. You want to bet? I've been anyway. You just keep it up because you were the one. My husband, you know, told me three years ago, he said, listen to this man. He's ahead of his time. And because you're the problem, I had to, that's why I'm in Canada because at least up here and we're on the same note that we're on the same year anyway. Yeah, we'll keep it up and thank you. How are you feeling? I'm really good. Good. Thanks, all. Have a great weekend. By the way, go back to this list of the chicken offs. Yeah. Interesting one night left out, but I shouldn't gloss over colon pal. Yes. What are we to make of pal? It says on the one hand, a long career as a military manager on the other hand, accused of covering up the meal I'm massacre and Vietnam. Back on that first hand, one of the seemingly same voices in this administration when it comes to Iraq, or at least he used to be, on the other hand, a clear hypocrite. I'm angry that so many sons of the powerful and well-placed managed to wangle spots and reserve national guard units, he said. Oops. And these are the same people he's working for and with and around and about. He's become one of them. Oh, there's the president. There he goes. On rookies to Silicon Valley for economic speech. I know if I listen, I'm long enough. What do you want to do? There's well, bloodscreegan, other asslicker. And of course, what's his name? Lou Dobbs. Oh my god. I think Lou is going to have the a hair down over the forehead and the mustache tonight. The airfield, the air Santa Clara, California, the black place aboard the aircraft. See, you know what they're so stupid, what they don't understand. It's because of the success of Fox, they think that, see, like I told you before, it's like, where's Limba? Right. Where's Limba? There, you got his big numbers, his great success. And then, Bill O'Raleigh comes on a radio on a national network and a year later, he's got zilch. Because where's Limba? Scott, all those ditto heads. And the same with Fox news, the ditto heads are going to turn over to CNN no matter how right we may become. They're not going to turn over to MSNBC. No matter how many Joe Scarboroughers or Michael Savage, they put on a year. Follow what I'm saying? Yeah. So they're just shooting themselves in the feet. That's all they're doing. Well, they're driving the opportunity for a little bit of choice on the airways, which is what I'm here. And I want the news. I'm tuned into CDCA. The athletes are concerned that this is not a concern. 85% of the venues for the athlete. Much in some real freaking news is opposed to this propaganda and cheerleading and a bunch of assholes who used to be journalists and suits with pom-pom. Kind of a bearer signal. When you turn on the network news and I'll stand or I like to let there be an AF football game. 560-70560, pound 560 on the AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line. Don't let me forget.

How I didn't even know there was a second verse to that limmer about man tucking. It pays to stay in school, doesn't it? But anyway, let's bring out our next guest here on America's most untalented kid. All the way from Seattle Washington here to sing, let me entertain you. Won't you please give a warm welcome to Little Dickey Fickernick-O! We're Dickey. Let me entertain you and we'll have a real good time. Let me entertain you and we'll have a real good time. Okay, Dickey Fickernick-O! You know, Dickey and that little green suit you look like a pimple leper con or something. I don't know. Is there any way, Joe, what did you think? He sucked. Okay, when he sucked, they'll- I'd say the same thing. He sucked. Okay, suck number two, Dary. Really, really all four. I would just say plain, softy. Ooh, Dickey, that's a nice voice. Sub-suck into sucky. This is enough to have a qualified for the finals. This week, boom, suck, I shouldn't not play! All right, good ones, Dickey and we'll get you next time on America's most full! So, I did get you, you know, my everybody did! That's what they do, and just while doing their play, I'm watching CBC, which I have under in the show every day, and they're doing news, you know, like real news stories. So, because of what that lady was saying in the article, I just read, I flipped over to CBC and MSNBC. Yeah, I think that's it. Me, Wes, Abraham Lincoln, returned to the directors of Sailors on there. It's an array of flyers, it's said of a message. Hey, Sailor! And the wires and they're hugging her little babies, and then I switch over to MSNBC. I guess what's on MSNBC, yeah. Thank you. I'm thinking about that. Now, you are. You're still a friend. You're still a friend. Now, have you spotted him? No, no, no. I'm going to tell you right now, seriously. If there's anybody in this audience, or anywhere in the world who really is stupid enough to believe that this is news. And I kind of understand if this were the variation rather than the norm, if this were the exception, right? Then I would say, okay, well, let's put something on there like a field good kind of a story of puff piece. But that's all there is. This is all there is. Non-stop photo opportunities and non-stop pepper alleys. That's what the talking heads are involved with round of clock 24. Seven out. Anyhow. Maybe. Okay, she's putting a microphone of the, are you on the MSNBC? No. I know. She's got the microphone in a face of this little kiddies about three years old. What's he going to say? He's going to make a speech. And he's like any three year old kiddies like, look, and there's scratching his head like what the hell do we all want, bitch? Yeah, right. Oh, my God. And this is going on non-stop round of clock. Home there is on it. What was it like when you first started young couple? I'm saying I'm with you. It's a wife and young baby. I can stop shaking and it's very sad. Very happy. What did you say now? I just mentioned these things in passing. Okay. I mean, wouldn't it be just like a little bit of balance, a little bit of truth, a little bit of really what's going on. In fact, that the electricity is still on most of the, most of the bag dead, and that they're a lot of continuing all the stuff going on. Now, we don't want to tell you the truth. What we want to do is go step along because we want to be willing, co-participants in this, whatever it held us to exercise is called. That's it. I think that's what I was looking for. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. I'm dying out of here. I have no way. I need to have this, I need to have this. I need to have this. Okay. I'll take some calls. Okay. I don't get all more written depressed about it because it ain't going to change. If you really want to know what's going on in the world, go to the internet, at least of the time being until they start digging with that too. Go to the internet, read a whole bunch of stuff, and certainly don't waste your time with the weekly readers. The news paid the two days in South 40 won't learn nothing from them. WQOM. You know how to go on? Okay. I don't quite know what you call, but it's a lady going home. You'll go out or something like that, you know which one that is. Sure. Yeah, that's great. And one is your personal one. Trust me when I tell you. Okay. And one other thing, my soda. I'm sorry. And you're still there. Yeah. I'm a CMS. You know, I got it. I listened to the shit. Yep, today. Do you listen to what? No. Oh, Schmidt, I thought he said something else. Pongers man. This whole thing was a system. President landed on the flight deck and all this though, I think I could listen to the details or beyond the lead. It's not. And this is newsworthy with more on your today. It's just basically. I know the camera. Hang in there. Hang in there. To be honest with you, I'm sorry. That was that other. 560, 750, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 80, 80, 80, and 10. Oh, this is a good story. This is kind of cute. Put a little smirk on your post. Sodom scene in London. We have it on a website. No, do we have the pictures that go with us or not? But of course. Of course. We would have to be in more. He doesn't miss a trick, man. That's what they said at Trasor Island. Sodom was saying a period to turn up in London today. This was yesterday. As dozens of hopefuls attended auditions to find a look alike of the former Raki Dick Tender. Short, thin, clean, shaving ginger hair, then in one case female candidates. That's those British women. You know, who thought they bore resemblance to Sodom, who still missing after the Wynaraka symbol of the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, England. They were handed army jackets, black burrays and falls mustaches, and asked to walk across the stage in way to an imaginary crowd. Chowths of next, filled the auditorium, as the Sodom doppled gangers, grinned the nightly, gave regal ways and attempted to strut around the stage dysphotically. What does a doppled ganger? A shapeshifting creature that copies its victims. I see. Charlie Shark, 21, a computer support worker from Isle Isle, Ileworth said a colleague said it would be a good idea to come down. I've had 13 years of jokes at work ever since Sodom invaded Kuwait. The look of us are needed for the West Ends, the West Ends, the Tyrical Review, followed my leader, which is due to open a vend of June. Here per serial Raymond Goobay said we had no idea who was going to turn up today, but I'm pleased to see we've had one or two good example. If they were unsure, they could just go to Baghdad. I'm sure they'll find dozens of, you know, whole bunch of lookalice and Baghdad. About 30 men! At least. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18, T-line, the mad dog at one. Oh, right! And then we got 80k for Hank from Vegas to three. Josh Friedman briefly for a fat half hour. I thought it was 7, 30. Wouldn't it be a great idea for a show where he could just get off his sports, much along with Josh? Huh? I think it's a winner. I think we got a winner. And just listen to the sounds of, if I Josh and the beast. Right? Having a feast. A feast with Josh and the beast. I think it a 40-year. Believe I'm doing it man! As they just said that we could have food brought in, Tony's Hill could bring it in and just a whole bunch of folks. So, are there corkeys? Yeah! Yeah! Sure, as hell, be talking about that stupid same sports crapper every day. My hand will go out of your sports video, 5, 6, and 2, 8, and... Oh, one moment, please. So, we have an problem there, we have B-d-boy. Yep. Yeah. Is he going to do something or is that a big deal? Yep. Is he going to do something or is that a big deal? Oh, yeah. I have no line. But I don't think we could have a fight there. They were even better than the first one. Yeah! Hold on. Hi, someone want power. Hi, you know. Come out to house and hunt the earth and run. To validate the spin of all those white. House, though. If you still need the Vincent to be my co-steer there. Or there there goes a lion from the old baby. But he falls such a... You know such a... Keep looking for proof of all the new TV away there there. But you know that he's gonna find it. No. He's never had the meaning. It's called 43. This is just insanity. But the good news is, Bush does speak on a economy 1230 on CNN live. 1250, I'm sorry. So we've only got seven more minutes to have to endure this naval attack. A aircraft which also can launch missiles, S3 Vikings. Where did that one area fly to yourself? These images said, oh my god, seafood for lunch. That's what I heard. You think they're gonna miss them to stew? Maybe. So now you understand why absolutely refuse to watch any more than necessary. CNN, MSNBC, and certainly not Foxbatch's news. And the worst news of all being, Mark Geragos, see, you look at all of this in the In the city of yourself. Either I've lost my sanity or I have to do everything I can to escape from all of this. But secondly, you won't say I was questioning it there for a while. It's just the same old, same old. It never ends. Mark Geragos, an anti-grace, a news-nancy-grace, a news-nancy-grace, a news-mark Geragos. And of course our root cause personal friend Larry will be having his nightly panels. And here's Mark Geragos with a big mustache who was defending a Robert Blake. And I was busy defending Scott Peters. And what's the use? What is the use? Because the message from the messenger is that we all must be glued 24-7 to this. And this is what we ought to be concerned about. This is what our lives should consist of. Is the swill that they're feeding the wass? The propaganda, the bullcraft, the photo-operatoonies. Just film a good e-earth. Is I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure, I'm sure. I like to break his knee caps, you know. I hate to say that. Why? I would like to, huh? Why would you hate to say that? I am enjoying saying it. I like to break his knee caps. Well, put the screen. What an ultimate skill. I mean, Lou Dobbs, at least he finally came out of the right wing closet. But this guy who pretends to be a journalist, you know the day that CNN really went down a crap. Is that the day the one Bernard Shaw retired? You're right. Oh, he wouldn't have put up with him in this crap. But nevertheless, and maybe the right price. Now this facts from Carlons to Don Arizona, do you ask a beat of boy about this? No. So, as I can't find the article on your website, you're right about 30 minutes ago, concerning the profits of several corporations in their role in this war for profit. You know what I mean? I don't know what story he was talking about. He said, he's a story. What is it? Guess what he's story, the one that you read yesterday and you read it today. Well, what is the heading on that, you know? If I don't give me a couple of seconds. I'll give you, don't see it. There he goes again. You've got him conditioned to being two of pressure packed there. Just relax. Take your time if you find it great. If not, time's up. Seriously, I mean, just if you find it great, and sure the Carl will appreciate it, because he's an avid listener on the internet, he says, keep up the good work there. More of us than the Goose stepping meat, he will allow us to know. Love you, Neil. Love you. Oh, yeah. Now that's one. I'll never play that. Ken, probably could've been so embarrassing. Hi. This is Jim. Love you. Show me your love you. That's the guy that's been. I guess that's what we call him as name. It's her other. He's a little bit more. Yeah. For other exactly. For other penis? You know, when there's a list of things to check off at the bottom, there's always other. Yeah. That would have been behind his. That's what he feels out to think, where says sex, MF or other.

The features page. Click on the features page. I don't have a sign. Which is really great now because now being a boy's got it by week. I looked at that yesterday for the first time in a while. That's getting just better and better. If I were someone I don't want to mention no names because it is Friday and so long we can. But if I was somebody, I'd be so embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated. The fact that this little punk came in and turned a once. Baron website. Into one of the gets routinely over quarter of million hits every day. And I will re-stay what I said yesterday and it's kind of a new wedgellasy. I don't know I would like more and more people to see it. When you look at that sludge report from his sludge on air and look at all the drudgery that she puts on and realize that there are millions of people clicking on it. And as still say look at it again today. We started a huge picture of George W when that silly outfit on. I flew to play and I flew to play. Right. Yeah. Fly where on this. And then you realize he's getting those millions of hits and there's nothing on it. It's just a basically a black and white page occasionally a color photo and it's about it. Just a black and white page with about 50,000 links and that's it. That's a website. Oh, wait. I got the Bill Schneider on CNN. He better not say something controversial. Look at him off. He'll continue to be on the agenda. But he wants to focus now on the economy because Americans are very worried about the economy. He knows what happened to his father when he had that's right. It's going to happen to him too. You wait till Bobby Graham till VD by I'm up at that big great. We'll have our own candidate for governor. Maybe nice. Wouldn't it. It would be nice.

Does he know anything about derby racing? No. Parnas racing. No. Pocky. Almost. Yeah. That's the only age that I think he knows about. He's seem to have like a lot of expertise on that.
