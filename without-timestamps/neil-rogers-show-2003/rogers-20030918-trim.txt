About an hour ago, a CBC said that up to eight American soldiers were killed, and O.C. and it said three or four injured, who knows what the real number is.

I'm low green. I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleader. I love more green. I don't have no idea what the actor's name was. He's probably a dead. I'll find out. Do you think? I mean, he didn't have a big part. I thought he was the perfect one. I love when he put those glasses on him. I'm low green. I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders. He was good. That's the one thing about the godfather. I want to say all three of them because he had Sophia and George Hamilton and the godfather of the ability. But the character is each character. See, that's why I love Magnolia so much. It's because they're like nine different stories there. And every character is like so amazing. And every acting performance is so sensational. And the same thing with the godfather. Every character was like worthwhile. There was no like wasted character who was just like, you know, the wallpaper. Even Mama Kualioni, Morgana King, she was great. Why but she she cooked up one hell of a bowl of pasta, you know? She looked like it. She looked like it. She looked like it. She didn't know. Enjoy it. I have a mirror pasta. Yeah, look like. Why do you know how it is? You know, cooking an eaten and tasting and sampling and eating and tasting and sampling? You know how that goes? Oh, fushine who are placed in a kitchen in the bedroom. Here's one about Kirit Grant, which we just put on. They're good timing. It says he was great comic actor. His girl Friday, the Philadelphia store bringing up baby, but he also played the Davener lead in drama North by Northwest, notorious and suspicion. Remember suspicion by Terry Stafford? Yes. Also for his time, he led one of the more obviously gay or bisexual lives he checked up with roommate Randolph Scott for several years across three different addresses. And the photo that they sent of them, I can't see the equality of it. I can't see the VTail. Can you? Nope. Are they like doing it? I think they're doing like do Easton. Oh, I want to picture. Anyway, Kirit Grant is on her. He was good. He was sensational. Outstanding. He was and well, so many. There's so many of these, which is good. A lot of dead people. 1113 at 5.60WQA.

Yes, sir. How are you doing everybody? Pretty good. I'm actually enjoyed Anthony Quins work. I'm not necessarily from the era, but I didn't. Why do you say it like almost a pollogenically? He was a great actor. Yeah, sure was. Well, that's my point. You had a question. I just I had an opportunity to see the Godfather's second part from beginning to end. I always called glints of here and there. Could you explain to me exactly why the conspiracy that Hyman Rawrf had against Michael? I mean, even if they even after the fact that they wanted to go into business together, we're cute with the hotels and all. Why do you tend to get his life and I'll just hang up in this deal? Well, I mean, you know, why it always happened with the families. They're always trying to run white each other out. Just like why did Marlin Brando do the whiteed Michael do the thing. Why put out the heads of the five families? I'm a white boy. Yeah. Right. Right. They were just a little bit devious. Okay. Just a little bit too drag and his heels are the cube of thing. And even though he showed up with the suitcase full of money, Hyman knew that he wasn't really into it and he had removed Michael. Yeah. I just like Marlin Brando. Look, Godfather wasn't into the drum business because, you know, that white powder, it's dangerous stuff. Michael was an impediment. That's why Salatso had to get him out. Out of the way. So there's always something, you know? Always something with him gangster. 567.0560. Pound 560 Anthony Quinza Good Choice by the way is outstanding a brilliant actor. Not one of my favorites, but good. 166 votes on air and Peter Finstill has only one. Yeah. Something that's okay. The bottom. I wish they can something about the queen. I mean, it got a call to me for about rock Hudson. What? And of course, to show you. And then I'm going to go to give it myself calling me up by the popcorn kettle pink. And I'm thinking, why is it this? Just because this guy's a flamer, he's got a vote for rock Hudson. I mean, do I have to vote for somebody who's gay? And then I look at who did I vote for? Peter Finstill. Now he wasn't gay, but he did play in one of his best movies was Sunday Bloody Sunday where he played the gay doctor. Do you see that? No. I saw it. I saw it. I saw it. I don't know the kid, but I forgot everything about it. Wasn't that the ball blowing up for something? Football stadium? No, no, no. That was Sunday something else. Something else. No, that was Sunday Bloody Sunday was the one where they were both in love with his young guy. The broad was in love with him and the Peter Finstill used to us split the time and day. Oh, did see it. Have to see it. Sorry. Peter Finst was the fact doctor. And the guy he just came to him for a headache and he would grab his package and he said, okay, turn your head in the car. Jack lesson varies. Got a great column here. I don't think I don't think I have to have time to read on our website. The worst president in history. From the Detroit Metro Times, it says, I'm just reading a couple of paragraphs. A Canadian politician once told me that if you put a frog in a pot of water and slowly increased the temperature to agree at a time, Mr. Hoppy would be completely cooked before he realized anything was wrong. I have no idea whether that's actually true for amphibians, but does seem to be true for the American people. Without his adoration, George W. Bush, light blue ties, silly smirk and all is the worst president as nation has ever had. Yes, I know my history. Richard Nixon was an nasty crook. Warren Harding was a slob. U.S. grants him an estration was hugely corrupt and James Buchanan failed to do anything to stop his session. They were all bad, but no one is. Nobody has done as much to ruin the nation and mess up the world as to be formed, drunk in front boy who's daddy failed at the job before him. You can't play in the voters too much. Most of them didn't even want him. He had to be inserted into the awful office by right wing partisans on the US Supreme Court after the people narrowly chose Al Gore. And it goes on, it's on our website today. Jack lesson varies from the Detroit Metro Times, the worst president in history and he is a little bit correct.

Okay. Yeah, the medical marriage we're in here got a lot of the people upset. They said it's suck. It wasn't fit for human smoking and sucking on and consumption. That's right. Right. That's what they said. Well, too bad. Anyway, who loves you? Maybe tell us about somebody's suggestion. Of course we'll put a monitor immediately. Not sooner. Even though you didn't like him because it was a cop show. But in personal against him though. No, he's going to be a robber. Chalbee on her. Our chronic facts are who is now factoring every day and I've assessed as robber. Chalbee was awesome as Captain Quint in jaws. And in the movie, the deep as well. Robert Chalbee. Where's Bob Lashitor would say? Oh, Pasha. Did he say that? Which is probably wise not on a year normal. Uh-huh. That's one of the many reasons. Plus the fact he was terminal and depressing in that. Right. He kissed him. Not probably didn't kiss enough. So there you go. Robert Chalbee. How's that thing coming? John Wayne looks like he's home free. He's home free. He's uh, cooled out. Back in the estals again with his favorite house, old Mary and Wayne. 560560 on the AT&T line. So the bottom line is, oh look at his 23,000 for it in 30 as a right now for our best of the campaign for our banded Parisque. That's pretty a week. Oh, look at it. Let's still. And we better have 25 grand by the end of this week. Or I'm going to be really porked off. Which means we got 1570 to go. Oh, we can do that. Well, I think we can probably do the 70. Would you on mark this afternoon? Right. Oh, we got a Harley-yout thing tomorrow 3 to 5 with me. Right. Well, we still got a tough road to hope because tomorrow's Friday last time I checked. We know it. You'll have all the best in the Elmerch and Dyson, including the more Howard David. That's a little bit. We've seen it in our CDs with Joe and Mark at singular wireless 4 to 6 this afternoon. 16832 North Kendall Drive. We want your money for a banded Parisque. It's a great cause if you want to read about them. Go on our website and read all about it. Now, get in back to these numbers again. Which we always do because we're a number intensive or obsessed with this. Because this is what we have to live with folks. This is what makes for breaks. We're number one. I'm looking at this in men. Okay. That's our target demo. We're number one in men in the midday by good margin. We went up. Went up a little bit and they have to do number one in men. Right. Nice car. Mad dog and hopper. Nice car, guys. But in the morning. We still have a little work to do. Frel is working frantically. But keep in mind, he's only half the load. Right there. Squarch. Yeah. Only half a load. He's carrying a heavy, heavy old load. Which is a problem. Because when you go from a 39 to a 4 3 in one month and you're up to 8.6 points in here. He's probably got about 8 of them and the other one's got a 0.6. Absolutely. Man, he's gonna have to have a tractor. Burgess Meredith who died 1997. That's a good one. I like Burgess Meredith the penguin. White bear with it. It always is an Russian course. Everybody remembers Burgess Meredith from Rocky. Even though I hated that movie like poison. It harms way. Grumpy old men. The Batman TV series of course the penguin. Thank you Doug. Burgess Meredith. Get him on there immediately. Not sooner. Anyway, getting back. So like we need a little while we need to continue creeping and climbing up in the morning. That's the deal. Okay. That's continues to be. Now what about nighttime? How did the marlins do? Did you look at seven to midnight and men or do you'd like to ignore it? Oh no. I glassed at it. You've planned, Stan. I don't think I even have it here. You don't have it? Four oh two seven. Yeah. Yeah. Night. Time for night. Four oh two four two. That's the marlin fact to begin. Right. Oh by the way, democrat pulls us as bush in over his head. Nearly half of Americans say president pushes in over his head according to a new survey by democrat democracy core. The polling and strategy firm founded by the ball James Carville and two other key democratic strategies. Mr. Carville, Bob Schrumman Stanley Greenberg told reporters yesterday that only is the post 911 boost from Mr. Bush over, but the president is arguably in the worst position now than in the summer 2001. He's convincing people that he's uncertain about what to do Mr. Schrum said. Mr. Schrum discussing the shrub. He is at one of the same time blustering and threatening and shooting off his mouth but on the other hand, doesn't have any idea what to do. How do you like that? He's in over his head. El Presidente. Well said, I think. Over here, we got the big ball game coming up to 1230. Are we upset about that? No, we're pretty pleased about that. That's the reward we get for habitable. Here's a lady in Daniel. Hello. Yes, ma'am. This is Valerie from Daniel. Pretty good. Valerie, how you doing? Wonderful. Thank you. I'd like to nominate you, Brenner. Well, that's good. I'd like to say a quick hello to my husband who's working hard on a deck. I love no. Okay. Thanks a lot. He's working hard on a white or deck. I think that's what you say. You will Brenner another ball guy. I want to ball guys. Okay. Your favorite ball actor, your favorite fat actor actress. Okay. Just make a mental note of these. Okay. Just the storm away for a rainy day. Like in a few weeks. 560560, pound 560 on the AT. See, you'll Brenner was good. But the king and I do a thing I can recall him from. Do you remember anything else he was in? What the world? The what? Westworld. He planned a world. With Richard Benjamin. Mm-hmm. I think he was staying out of Westland too. He used to live in DCP and he was also in some like the last warrior or something like that some doomsday movie he was a knife stabbing guy. I'll be damned. A backstab or he should have been in a radio business. That's what Mohitz said. Absolutely. By the way, you're an asshole. Not you, Moh. Well, that's be said to, but the beast. That that sucking up to Zagaki. He's a great play by a playman. You know, that was so that may have been the most outrageous, ridiculous suck I've ever heard or been involved with in my life. You know, everybody likes a little suck, but nobody likes a suck hole. Beast. I wanted a head-hand. Here's plantation. Hello. Plantation. Hello. Yes sir. Neil. Yes, I am. How are you doing? Good. How about the McQueen? He's already on there. Oh, he's probably got some votes. He does? Yep. He's got, he's got 11 votes. Okay. That was my vote. Okay. Thanks. And I was one of the early ones somebody called and so he probably didn't hear it. He's probably like all the emotional after hearing about those numbers. I don't know. And I know there's a segment of the audience. Oh, you know who cares about those rate? Well, that's like I said. That's it. This is the definitive place where all the people in the business go. Of course, I really give it short trip. I didn't meet anybody else's numbers too much. It's a Howard sperm. But do we really care about anybody else's number? Except our good colleagues and friends on a radio station? Not really. No. Not all that much. Like men in the morning, I OD went from a 46-dot of a 43. That's one I left out. The Schmidt-Mister from a 55-to-a-five. I'm dropping from second to third. You turn. See all of that right wing crap. The rack attacks that that's starting to like fade into oblivion now. Here's North Miami. Hello. You heard. Good afternoon. How you doing? All right. Everybody has mentioned him so far, but he died very recently to kill a mockingbird, Gregory Peck. Oh my god. How can we? That's sacrilegious. Thank God you got him before we ended this thing. Hey. And I would love to see if the whisper and people there would jump off the same bridge together. I'd paid a watch. Hey, man. Thanks, pal. Thank you, sir. Gregory Peck. Did you just die as your walt to go? Same. Wasn't it the same day or just with him? Kate Hipper? They're about to get back. And it took almost to the end of this experiment here. The sex size for somebody to finally have the decent ZDC to call in more of the great, great great actors in the history of mankind. That's he was. Gregory's Peck. To kill a mockingbird. Who's that other one? The other big one. The exorcist? Oh, actually he was an old man. Of the old man. That's the old man. The other thing. You know, double, double movie. Yeah, double, double. John Wayne's got 40 Jimmy Stewart's got 20. So he's double his nearest competitor to the Duke. You can't touch the Duke, baby. And who'd he would want to? Humphrey Bogart 18, Jack Lemon's 17, George C Scott 15, Kate Hipper and 14. You know, it's the trend here. The macho people are way up there including Kate Hipper and God was she butch. You know, it's Bruce Lee 13. Jack, he leaves in 12 merlot in my role. 11. I'll do the double. Did you want to see the queen. Kevin, Greg Grant 10, John, candy, 10 Peter, cell. You know this. Kate Hipper and son, everybody. You know who is not on there with pleases me.

Guess who's coming to dinner. Oh, it looks like Spencer, Tracy. Guess who's playing Dr. Jack on this. Right. It was always the same person. Maybe I'm wrong. Call me crazy, but I'm just another Spencer, Tracy fan. 23 past noon at 5. 60 WQM, the pressure of the ratings is over now. We came through that with flying colors now.
