He's there in the oval office, though he's not sure what an oval is. He's practicing his speech that he's been working on for weeks should be a breeze. But it's not for a man who thinks that if you're from a ranger, it really is. Saturday he's still no smarter, thinks what's in the center of central goal. You could say his brain is useless, kind of like the Cheneys clocked up ventricles. Now he goes to give the speech with words his bone can't not reach, he looks so afraid. But he won't tell you how he feels instead, he'll talk about some bad mistakes he'll make. He can't spell, he can't run out loud. He can't speak, so what he says, so isn't out. You'll never clue, nobody listen, so he just babbles on. Babbles on. Babbles on. He's got to get that ain't too bad. Same occupation as dad once had, closest his eyes when it comes to ten. Helps him to remember all of them. Like the bush we had before he's got the same name on the oval office store. He's in there thinking unlike Clinton. I don't make the country wonderful. Open George W. You wait like this dad when it quarter said four two bomb back at. You sit down on to another fight and my scared George and make him want to cry. His eyes when it goes to vent and dreams of the weekend making smile. If you better win, you hear him say, that you are saying we'll be wonderful someday. He might promise us everything that don't need spittle. And he's got to change me. To blame if something goes wrong. Once the press gets to him he'll realize he's impressive and he's so wonderful. The morning had been here for two years and I know four five sixty WQAM. For those of you that haven't figured this out, it's not George and it's not Neil. This is Carlos. We'll be taking requests and playing some best of Neil tapes today. So can you call off the end? I'll be happy to play anything you got. I'm honored to welcome so many people who devote their lives to the well-being of others to the Rose Garden here in the White House. There are around five million hardcore users of the illegal drugs in America today. We must do and we will do drugs. We must increase the floor drugs into America. This will make working in close cooperies with Mexico a priority. And we infatically disagree. There are American parts being laid down at the bottom of our chests.

But thanks for taking her call. We've been trying to reach you for the past couple days. We're trying to reach me. You've called people I haven't been invented yet. You called dead relatives of mine. What's the story, Heather? We're working on a story about the CD here promoting on your website. That's called Kisses. I won't say it. And word, good morning. Heather, are you listening to the show? Yes, I am. I've been listening to a couple days. And just see what we're doing. Did you hear me go through the entire rationale of what that song had. Nothing to do with condolese rice. Uh-huh. What about the song, condolese and condolese? That was obviously about condolese. I don't know. I just want to know why you're playing this on your show. I'd like to know why this is really interesting. Why are you calling me asking me why I should play this? We have song periods about built-clinton dozens of them. Nobody ever complained about that. We have song periods about Al Gore dozens of them. Nobody ever complained about those. Well, African American folks up here in New York are pretty offended by it. Well, you know, let me say this to you, Karen. We're not in New York. Uh-huh. Okay. We don't broadcast in New York. We're on WQM in Miami. Oh, oh. And the fact of the matter is that, let's accept for people like you and the people at that right wing newsmax.com. I want to make a big sentence about this. If we weren't for that, they would even be aware that we exist. We have to come up. This organization that's offended by it is a national organization. But the fact of the matter is we've been playing these songs for many, many, many months. We've never had one single complaint. And when interlopers like you from outside like from Fox News are from some right wing website. Want to tell us what? I mean, for you to ask me, how come you're playing that? Because we want to play it. What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it called? It's called comedy. That's what it's called. Do you have a sense of humor? Do you think it's funny? It's called, uh, call kind of leaves a riot? In a, in a, in a day in a day, in a day, Well, Harry Bellafonte called her the house Negro. Okay. So we'll call her whatever we want. But this is a little bit different. I mean, No, it's not just taking issue with the, It's not the least bit different. She is the house Negro. See, you people at Fox News, I don't understand this. Not everybody in the world is the right winger like group or Murdoch. There actually are those of us who are progressive or moderate liberal. Whatever we are, who also have the right to speak to express whatever it Helping want. So, so we're, we're paying again what you just said for me there. You think she is a what? She's the house Negro. Uh-huh. And you don't find anything wrong with that. Well, but what do you mean, Roe with that? It's the fact that's my opinion. And my title of my apartment. And you're, you're certainly entitled to your opinion. And that's basically what Harry Bellafonte said as well. And it's obvious, this is why nobody returned your calls. Uh, Heather or whatever your name is. Because we knew that you were trying to stir up a bunch of crap and take something out of context. When I asked you, I don't think did anything to be in the house. Did you listen? Did you listen? We're not doing it. We're not doing it. I'm not doing it. It's my show and I'm not going to have you scream over me. You're trying to out talk me. Okay. Okay. You know, I asked you in the beginning of the conversation, which I was very calm. And I asked you, did you hear me explain the origin of that song, the rest of Tussan song, The fact of the matter is that I don't, I'm sure he must have been on your channel, Randall Kennedy, the Black author who wrote the book, Nigger the Strange, Career of a Travel Sam word. Not that I'm aware of. Well, he was certainly on CNN. He was on MSNBC. Maybe he was on Fox because he wasn't out. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't. We're in a where of it. Mm-hmm. Oh, you, we all have had questions for you. Are you aware of that book? You portray yourself to be this sort of liberal voice. But yet you're, Ma, I don't portray, I don't put labels on me. I'm, for example, Okay. I'm going to call you up then. I am, myself, a human being. You see, you people on Fox, it's this old liberal and a conservative, that's stuff when I would hide button shoes. I'm making living and bringing you being in a video. In addition to why do I have to add Miami Florida, answer to some assholes in New York, on Fox News, how I do my show. What is it your business? There are a lot of people who can. There are people in Miami. They care about this too. Who are they? Who are they? Name me one person. My name is concerned about it. But we know down there certainly. Name me one. Name me one. Name me one. It's offensive. Name me one. Name me one. Name me one. The very high advocate. I'm a guy. What you see? We don't like collier. Okay. Have a nice day. Okay. We're calling her whatever we feel like calling her. She's a public god damn figure. And blow it out your right way. And ask. And you and Bill.

They may like start doing like the Eskimos and build igloo's and go inside and never come out Come out. Oot. Here's a mobile lady and Holly would. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Good morning. I've this is the first time I'm calling you However, I've listened to you for years and I do admire many of the things that you say But however, I take issue a little bit this morning with the pot testing with regard to your employment. There are some situations where it is very dangerous to smoke pot Particularly if you like to drink beer lunch or even have a drink at lunch and you mix it with the pot There are things you can do that you normally wouldn't do like what well for example I know of a personal experience because I'm going to be an insurance agent and we have a very serious situation that occurred in one of our insured Business operation was a man did that just that at lunch time came back and an a job that he had been working on for ten years That's his hand in the mixing that and cut it off all right Excellent. Well, let's teach him. I guess you won't be doing that again. No, I guess he won't so what's the problem? Well, the problem is that drug testing on the job is in many cases very important And so if you smoke pot, you shouldn't be doing it while you're working I mean maybe if you're working in a job Well, wait a minute. You said you shouldn't be doing it if while you're working, but if if it stays in your system for like up to a month How do you know what when you're doing it? Suppose you smoke it recreationally on a weekend at home now when you're on a job Well, I don't know very much about how long it stays in your system. I just got through telling you up to a month What about your testing after lunch? Yeah, that's right. How about boost testing after lunch? Let me tell you something as those kind of stuff I'll well breathalize your test after lunch. Well, I don't I mean, where do we stop this insanity is when I say? Actually, I really do believe that we have become insane with testing except that in the case of drugs It is a very important thing in some situation I'm not saying that we should be testing everybody for everything because we're losing totally our rights in this country We don't have any rights in this country. We have a right to be oppressed by a fascist police state is what we have I don't have any rights. This is in a free country. It's a joke Hey, listen, we still have the right to talk to you about these things which makes it a right Unfortunately we're limited as to what we can say Debbie, you still got to watch your language or the word police are gonna come down and they'll take you away That's something else again. I don't agree with that either I think if you want to say follow things you can say them and that shouldn't be oppressed by anybody and whether it's on the radio or TV or wherever But the point is that they're I don't know if you agree to this completely maybe impartially you agree that there are certain situations We are drug testing whether it be marijuana or heroin or whatever is an important factor I would say if you're working in a candy store Then they definitely should be able to drug testing you want something or in any kind of arrest route They don't watch you on the profits right don't a chop that would be the one have a great day sweetheart We have an open line in date 5 6 7 5 60 and Pong 5 60 because God forbid if you smoked weed like two weeks And to go and you had a beer for lunch today We know that you are a danger to society God forbid pizza chef or delivery boys Definitely yeah, that's right Chinese food delivery. Oh, I don't tell a ways he would never and he didn't have to smoke weed How do you like that and he still had the monkeys? He was a hungry boy. He was just a big chubby hungry guy That's all and he ate all $40 worth of Chinese food on the way back to the house Can you imagine if they tested radio management for alcohol after lunch? Oh, yeah, I've they went up there right now Oh my god how about brain testing for management? That sounds good to me Of course where there's no sense there's no feeling Here's North Miami hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, you doing the ill great I have a question. Yes. I have two questions and then I want to see them in my guitar How come you can't get ice cream like did it leave here because I have a lot of pistach I don't need a lot of ice cream, but man I used to eat I eat it every day and Italy the stash or ice cream And a lot of those Sergio Latto is not ice cream. It's gelato. It's made. It doesn't have all that cream It's not all at the chalk and artificial crap. It's made from all natural stuff and they don't make it here There you know once in a while a place will come along and try to make good gelato And even if it is good the public's taste here is so bad because the busy and wires and seal says and eat These that those places go out of business And I used to I mean I've I don't I don't I'm in an ice cream But I was eating it every day twice a day. Yeah, I mean every little shop had it well When I go to Italy, I eat it a lot and the ice cream too Hey I have a question for George you can't you have this commercial called feet field extreme watches was it his voice on it? Yes Yeah, he apologizes profusely for it too And about let me ask you a question if this guy would have been from Amsterdam where it's legal the smoke pot What were they gonna say to the guy? Well, you know, it's interesting because of Merid that now that is a good point marijuana They were just saying on CNN that marijuana is not among the substances listed at the Olympics is being illegal But that it reverts back to the country and the laws there so if it were one of the Dutch players in like a soccer player Of course, and I play no soccer in the winter a little bit, but whatever the Dutch competitors are ice skater Uh, then it would not be a problem. How do you like that? And Canada says that's blatantly unfair in a bunch of crap and they're requiring foul Hey I don't think that's very fair. How do you like that? How do you like them green apples, huh? Those green apples So I say that this guy this uh, Graziano or Greg Gabrielli, I say you should move to how Amsterdam would be a good idea Hey, there you go, at least you'd never good time And as far as our drug testing in the workplace, yes, tell they can figure out At the weekend drug testing at the moment know how much you've had at that particular moment I think they should just band it all together because there's no way that you're gonna tell me what I have to do in my house In my car, or when I do at any time that I'm not at work because I only work for them for eight hours Met the rest of my day, so that's the bottom line. Look next thing they're gonna be doing fish food testing Hey there you go. Yeah, why don't we just survey and let's see uh let's pay your facts I want you to visit see how much food you've been eating right exactly I mean, what do you want to draw the line you know what I mean? Let me get a cute tip and check this woman mouth maybe she's been giving more of sex to somebody in the parking lot Oh, yeah, now you're talking okay have a great day pal.

Welcome back to the glittering legendary of the Mohawan in David's show We have a full duck at today That included the cavalcade of our ticket at the late Ibu's You know that pipe smoke is still at it What? Why'd we sing into those songs? Make it fun of me! They make fun of me all the time, I don't know Why'd they do the door? Yeah, they're everything will be alright, bro It's a hint of me, a fairy, you queer! Yeah, don't jump up! Real men don't touch, only during the game! Yes, Mr. They want singing, I'll give them singing, get on a piano, I'm in there! Okay, ma'am! Now, hit it! Back in my day, men were straight! The day is new today! That's why I care the dollar raid! She's got slid gaze! Sport holes were in David's back there! Stop it, you moron! What's the matter, Moh? My wing fell off, I guess. Okay, all right, where were we? Sport holes were in David's back there! Oh, I'll take it from here! They're guys that like the worship men! Click, think we won't see for the door, Way live in that of my game! Didn't mean to sooth our state to this! Or to ticko hairy taint! Jesus Christ, I really hate! Jesus God, slid gaze! Hi, Felicia! Gee, I love your dress, and your hair looks so shiny and manageable! Are you still shampooing with head and shoulders? Gosh, chick! I've got busy head and shoulders a long time ago. I mean, honestly, who grows hair on their shoulders anyway? Yeah, right. So, what are you using now? Well, it's like head and shoulders, only without all those added in. It's just called head! Let's tell them about it, girls! If you tie your dumps, oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah! I'm feeling good! Yeah, yeah! Just remember what I said! Yeah, yeah! You feel better if you get some head! Wow, where could I get that? Lots of places, chick! You can stop by my place later, and I'll be happy to give you some head! In 50 minutes, I'll have you shampooed, styled, and blown dry! You don't miss a link, do you? Pentsa, can you bring? But is it expensive? Not at all, chick! My brother says there are places downtown where you can get head for less than $10. Darling, at that price, everyone should be getting head! That's right, chick! When you say head, you set a mouth full of pie. I'm Dr. Raymond Felotti, get it. When for the violinist, you're to tell me why you should get head? First, it lubricates each limp hair bottle. Leading an erect listening shaft. Then the scalp's natural oils are sucked out of the root, leaving your hair soft shiny and exhausted. Nothing does the job like head! Great! Can I get head for my hairdresser, Bruce? Probably, but you might want to try your girl friend first. So up and in the head today, get head! And then work, go to normal way! Get head! You look better and you'll feel terrific! Get head! And you get head! You're a lucky step! What hair with lots of volume? Nothing gets it up like head. Available little price, you won't find hard to swallow, and it's going down every day. Connie, we're out of shampoo! Can you go out and get some head? What did you say? I said, I wanted to go out and get head! Oh, thank you, sweet Jesus! I'm going down down! And head makes a great holiday gift. Last Christmas, my wife gave me some head! Then I gave her a pearl necklace! I've never seen her so choked up! My girlfriend used to give me heads, and then we got married. Now I'm lucky if I get Durgen's lotion in a national group. I'm lucky, but I want to have a head! He doesn't go! My girl, I've got a team head in the shower! You'll want to have a head! No, no, no, no! I'm lucky! Say goodbye to my girlfriend! I can't ride straight ahead and feel it so can't you? That she never would've thought I'd said! I can't feel better than you get some head! Don't feel better than you get some head! Oh yeah! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh! Head shampoo! Come on, give it a shot! My hair looks glorious! Oh, man! Can you use a nap? Yo, man, what's up with you? Go from a spoko! So anyway, let's do a mobile and west pombie, Chilo. Neil, can't disagree with you more about the pot smoothie. Okay, I'm an ex-pot addict from the age of 15 to 25. Yeah, I'm telling you, I was more dictating than cold than any of them. We had to... And we were dictating them in fish food too, I bet. Correct! I was just passing another room. Better take a sample by the way. Before we'd opt 38 now, I stopped 13 years ago, but before we played baseball, we smoked, before went to the movies, it's smoked. Yeah, we had sex, we smoked, before anything. We need a pot. We can do it without pot. Yeah. A lot of my friends are still on my mind. Well, let me ask you this, as much as I frown upon people who are like obsessed with pot, because there are people who are juvenile and sit around sifting and picking seeds all day, and I think that's a life. But nevertheless, we have to wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! It's not just green stuff, that had no seeds in it. How did it affect your life? It affected it tremendously, because it opened the door too, and you're going to think this is joking. Open the door to Coke. It opened the door. One was on gay, yeah. Yeah. Once you violate your body, why don't you better never have a beer, because next thing you're going to be done. I don't... I never like beer, but I'm telling you, it affected me in the workplace, it affected me driving. I had a lot of eye on that. No, but they argue that it's the same argument as you better never have a beer, because then you're going to become an alcoholic, and you're going to start drinking, you know, that it has stick and vodka bottles in your pocket. I mean, there are always going to be people, and people no matter what you're talking about, they all go, it's the end of the world, they're going to go out and need it to be 500 pounds. Does that mean we should outlaw any foods that are fattening? No, no, but I've changed. I have two kids of my own now, and they're 14 and 11, and they're getting to that age, where I remember when I saw it, so you better stop. Yeah, no, no, no, no, I stopped a long time ago, but I'm saying now I'm overprotective. He can smell like his debris in his home. By parents of like George, there were refugees from Cuba that came down here. Well, no humans don't smoke, we know that. They didn't know any better, they were working 14 hours a day. I was alone at home, and all my friends did it. We did it, and I'm telling you, I'm telling you, they didn't know any, but I couldn't disagree with you more. I'm not testing for it, and I hope they keep it out of everything, because it's not fattening. I know that when I go over to Hollandman, every time I've only been an Amsterdam and I'm about 30 times when I go over there, it's a miracle that the country can function, you know it. I'm telling you, let me tell you something. While we were on it, we were less aggressive. Sir, let me ask you, have you ever been to Amsterdam? You've never been to Amsterdam. Well, get on a plane and go there, you might learn something. There's a pot-edic for you there, boys and girls, there's a good lesson for everybody. He's obsessed. It's like the fish food addicts. I say we go to publics right now, and may enforce them to take a run out of the freezer container, because we have fish food addicts already, and those people are going to kill themselves on that crap, because they're out of control. And let's close down every bar, because we got alcoholics. Let's bring back pro-abition, maybe let's prohibit everything. Then we got sex addicts. Just watch, uh, what's his name, Jerry Springer. He'll do 20 shows on it this week. Sex addicts. People who can't get enough. They're doing it. The NBA, they want to do drug testing. We got a guy, a Canadian, a jock. If a snowboarder can wear a jock strap, whatever it hell he was, this guy may lose his gold medal because he may have actually inhaled a little bit. Or may have actually smoked a little bit. Or may have actually walked through a room somewhere where somebody may have smoked it or not as the case may be. And they thought like a little trace in his score. Score, score. Yeah. And they're having a nervous breakdown now because they, you know, suit a fed. What else? What else can we test for in your system? Definitely have fish food testing because we know it makes your blood sugar go away. Up and you become irresponsible. And got only knows you're going to, you're not fit for driving. I wouldn't be surprised if they stop you at street corners. Now it's stop lights and they do on the spot checks blood sugar test. You know, they give you that little pin prick if I can say that. And yeah, look at my fingertips. Man, look at all those pinfrikes. That's right. When you dive at it, you have a lot of pinfrikes on the tips of your fingers. But at any rate, they're going to be starting doing that spot checks on street corners now. And if your blood sugar is like over 250, but yeah, you're a straight to jail. You're a menace to society. You're going to kill somebody out there. Airline pilot before you get on a plane. Make sure he didn't have no fish food before he took off. Here's the four-laterdale. Hello. Hello there. Yes sir. I guess I'd be in a cute collar since I'm a chronic. Okay. Anyway, I consider myself a well trained high-precision cynic. You agree with a lot of the things that you talk about. But in the United States, of course, what right we all have really is the right to be as irresponsible as you want to be. Until you reach a certain limit. And we have these freedoms when people sort of they abuse them. Until it starts costing somebody some money somewhere. And then they got to go and do something about taking that freedom away. But what does that mean? When is marijuana ever been decriminalized in America? Well, I mean, it hasn't. But the reasons for that. Are they tried prohibition with booze? That's your work for your well, didn't it? No. And it's a poor job. Work for your Kennedy real well. You can't expect our people to be responsible with the freedoms that they have. Like we have a small business. And we've got, you know, we do contracting an authority thing. And you got guys, they're not exactly the top model society. But they go out and they're doing physical labor for you. And they're climbing roof tops and things like that. And we've had cases in the past where people were on the influence of substances. And they've acted it. And then the customer. Well, if you're liable for, I can understand. And then you're talking about a physical right. I understand that. And then not only that, but the employee suits you too. You can know he was the one who was irresponsible on the job. So what do you do about that? Well, in that case, that's an exception. I wouldn't have any problem with that. I can see in the NBA where if a guy is stolen, he's not going to injure somebody out on the court. If anything, he'll take fewer shots. And he probably wouldn't beat up the coach. Well, good point. But the thing is, we have something that we do at work here. Not that it works, but it's in a tamped anyway. That's called a drug free workplace. And you start off your relationship with the business under the assumption that, you know, you're not going to, this isn't going to be something you're going to be doing on the job. So we're allowed to drug test before you start the job and that's sort of thing. And what's sad about this is it's amazing how many people who call up looking for a job. And you say, oh, but by the way, this is a drug free workplace. How many people show up, fill out the forms and then just never appear again. It's, it's huge. Well, but it's not that their choice. You just got to say, but you know, but the thing is, if this is going to be responsible for what it's employees do, then we have to know, we have to feel safe and secure that they're not going to be out right now. Yeah, no, I would have to do with that. I think that you got a, you know, you have a right because you're liable. And you have a right to make sure that they're not doing whatever might impair their senses, et cetera. But that's a very rare exception. If somebody's doing an office job at a desk unless, of course, they're making decisions. The decisions that, you know, are like national security risking something like that. Yeah, I can understand that. Yeah, or for radio equipment or something like that. Exactly. And I think it might help to have some drugs for these bastards over here. But the thing is, you know, once again, as a society, if the people aren't going to be responsible enough to be able to decide when they are or aren't going to use the substances, but you know, you know, something, you know, something, but you know something. Let me say something to you. And that is that as long as things are forbidden, when you go to Europe, there is no drinking age in any country that I know of in Europe. And yet as Italy, especially public drunkenness is frowned upon, a such an extent that, I mean, they would, they would come and beat the crap out of you. If they found you staggering around drunkenness, street, they would take you under cover somewhere and give you a lecture and sober you up and tell you better not to ever do it again. Or any, you don't, you don't have any problem of young people staggering around drunk or killing each other because they're drinking and driving. You don't have that. Now the French have it because they got a bunch of drunks over there to begin with. But I'm talking about in countries where they're generally socially responsible in a first place, like Italy and like Holland and those, you don't have that problem. There's no drinking age. There's no smoking age. There's no smoking age. There's no smoking age. There's no smoking age. There's no smoking age. There's no smoking age. There's no smoking age. But it's not that good. But it's not that good. Holland, which is the freeest country in the world. What does that have to do with it? It's the end of the culture they grew up with that kind of freedom in the US. There we go. That's why I just got through saying the end. So as the longer you make things for bitten, the more people want them. That's my point. Okay. Before I leave, or you cover it. I want to give you something. I don't know if you can use this as a cart, but I want to do a celebrity impersonation for you. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. See it. Now that wasn't bad. Georgia was almost cute. It wasn't a very good consensus. Let's see. Mike from the Keys says it's too expensive. That's his opinion. He likes the little weed now and he said too damn expensive. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes sir. What's up, Neil? Love your show. Thank you so much. Listen. It is kind of expensive. But I wanted to say this whole marijuana thing is just out of hand. I mean, the government, they must be some like babbling chimps, pushing some where they'll realize that marijuana is probably the safest in toxic on this planet. It's less harmful in alcohol. It has never been documented to give cancer like, you know, cigar and cigarettes. Yeah. I'm not complaining about the guard. And it doesn't send your blood sugar raising up like sugar does either. I don't know. Sugar. Aguirre and T.A. right now sugar was a lot more dangerous than marijuana ever can be. And I don't think they did any sugar testing on his Schmendrick gabriotti guy that this snowboard to the one-of-gold metal over there in Agano. Absolutely. I think it's blood sugar and see if he was doing fish food before he did the thing. Absolutely. And I like to go to a lot of this thing to be at the, I was wondering how come you didn't like our thing and big is the one that's asked you out as well. That's like my cigar of the guy. You know, I do like car shivigas. But I mean, it's, uh, they don't make him in next, which is my sponsors. So I'm not going to come on here to say hi. It's smoke car shivigas. Which one do you like in particular the, uh, the Galantes? You've ever had the English corona? Oh, I don't touch those English ones. Oh, yeah. The English corona is a fabulous, especially if you're rolling it open. Okay. Um, but thanks a lot, Neil. Okay, have a great day. Let's go to a Miami, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how's it going? Great. We'll listen, uh, you know, a couple bad things. Unfortunately, marijuana is classified as a schedule one drug, which means it's right up there with cocaine heroin. Methinphetamine and, uh, Jerry Springer is perhaps the worst drugs of all mankind. Uh-huh. And fish food. And fish food. But, uh, you know, this is just the word for that guy. Was that guy cheating when he, there was a guy called in. He said, I run a workplace and I tell people that I drug test, but I don't really drug test. And then that just sort of weeded out the peat part in mind the point. I mean, weeded out the people that really don't want to. He said, well, what was it? What was that whole thing about? He said that he drug tested. No, he, he drug tested. He said that a lot of people come by and they fill out the application when they find out that it's a drug free workplace that they don't hear from them again. He said, all right. Well, I think he's a fascist because, you know, he's basically just got a bunch of people that were doing like yard work or something, you know. And if they're going up on roofs and things and he's responsibly, he's got the liability insurance for that. I can understand that. Uh, I don't know, man. I mean, if you're, if you're still looking, if you're still not any substance, I don't care what is. Uh, I don't want to be responsible for your work or driving or whatever else you're doing. You know, the thing is that they might not be up on the roof and be stoned at the same time. They might go home, watch Jerry spring or and then be stoned and then go back to work and be perfectly straight and still fail at miserable tests. Okay, it's an issue on now.

I'd like to make a comment about the pot head that calls earlier that they've been for 10 years. Yeah. He said that the marijuana made him try other drugs. I think that he's been betrayed. Everyone else has been betrayed by all the uptake people in this country because they tell you that marijuana be bad for you and it's evil and all this stuff. And then when you try it and it's not that bad, you say, well, they lied about this. Well, maybe they lied about everything else too. Yeah. Deliciously different marijuana. Deliciously different marijuana. This poor guy's going to go back to Canada with his middle between his legs. Never be the same again because they found this little teeny tiny trace of marriage of weeny in his test. Neil? Yes. I say we all get on a plane, go to Italy and smoke a bullet. All right.

Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. I've never listened to your show for but I was interested in your views on why why it's illegal in the first place I mean, I mean it's an all-acoustic spirit. Sure because this is a repressive society in which we live. Let me say it again These are kicks out of me laws that are in the book in most states in this country in which all anything except they face to face missionary position Sex between married male and female what you're laughing about it of okay, but true. You have all these archaic laws on a book because this is a country of hypocrites a country that's living in the stone age Because we got a bunch of old funny studies up there who don't have the balls to repeal these archaics stupid intrusive laws that have no place in a civilized society Well, in marijuana case, have whatever there would be the national debt if they would action and and grown it the last 20 years Let me say this to you sir the idea that the federal government listen to this the federal government continue what seed you can plant in the back yard of your home on your property The idea that the government can legislate that is so outrageous and so unacceptable as to be in this inexplicable I can't argue with that one bit. They've always helicopter waste in time because people are growing a few plants in their backyard In the meantime up the corner kids are shooting themselves because daddy left his six his six shooter laying around and everybody in their brother and his countries running around with a goddamn gun But God forbid that somebody's growing a few plants in a backyard We got the helicopters going overhead baby. We're gonna catch you the the pot police are there you maniacs just like in a low word I know I do with that local section this morning here. We go business man or sex per veir police this Arthur van morke Kirk and whatever his name is Kirk and jerkin ran a six million dollar prostitution ring. How do you like that in Fort Lauderdale He had fifty women on their payroll their names neatly lined up on a magnetic board under hitting such as blondes Brunez and Oriental's their clients more than 20,000 men between West Palm Beach and North Miami You pay a hundred eighty bucks in cash or 200 by credit card for acts that range from a straight sex to unusual fetishes So who the hell gives a crap? Probably ran a clean operation probably not too many people getting no diseases from that Operation probably hit it on the up and up. He's going to jail everything in his goddamn country's illegal man Everything is the forbidden fruit if we can say oh and of course that's oh forget that talk about a fruit Forget about that everything's illegal Everything's immoral unless of course it's the politicians who are doing it like Dan Rolmer He's doing it over there and like Bill Clinton of course He's doing it the left and right in which we like him a lot more and respect him because he's getting it that's okay But if we're getting it then of course it's evil and we all go to jail Juvenile and unacceptable on acceptable Your brain wash baby when you're gonna go just wake up and sniff it a little bit and the flowers too brain washing Goody two shoes. We have to have a drinking age and we have to have a we have to have an age for everything a Smoking age Otherwise when you 20 what it's okay to get yourself lung cancer, but if you're 19 and you're not old enough to make that decision Just like that this crap about the age of majority every you know most countries What is this is just a matter of opinion most countries even some that we consider very backward The legal age for consensual sexual acts is 15 or 16 and this country is what? 17 for heterosexual acts and 18 for yes There's a different age for heterosexual or homosexual acts of course or is it 18 for both? There's all of these gray areas depending on which state you're in I didn't say gay areas I said what's what's well? We'll find out what state you're in lies in a prone or what position if you're more than two years older You can be 16 as long as the person isn't more than two years older and over eight while it was an animatronic So in other words if a 19 you guys bang the 16 year old chick He's in violation of laws that we were saying to me something like that isn't that ridiculous? Yeah, isn't that absurd Here's the Fort Lauderdale hello. Yes, sir. Very aggressive and back to your happy circus. Yeah, on that product Tusion ring the guy from my boat and I'll Fort Lauderdale no big deal. There you go. You're quite close enough for us. Yeah You got another thing on the on the pot. I don't know business. I drugged that right on the application He brings drugs man. I test All right, whoa, all right. See if the track back where we certainly know nothing about drugs There's your kind of boss George. I thought we had that. Oh, yeah, he wouldn't know what to do with them. Asian For Give it on crap So watch out for all because I'm coming at you I'm gonna Yeah, I'm gonna run you down So get your better thought of time Probably need out is such a stereotype It's a waitress knows there's no tip to not I Oh Doesn't speak French and the frog is Why is he tips for when the check comes he can read English So But do they have to be so cheap why must you pause like they're all the way to Florida Go Why can't you just stop at out of the border go back We don't want you from the beach Just carry Look at that Why are they back I wish they could go back I can't take it anymore What is summer coming Oh Speaking of grabbing crosshuckers. You know we love how many go in their own country and you grab them across the interstates And you stop at one of those stookies or stuckies or whatever they're called man talk about pack with glam with bad taste Although I do like some of that candy the peanut brittle's okay. I've had a nut roll. Yeah, when it's slipped out of my hand Didn't roll too far though. Here's a coconut grove. Hello. There's no facts in Columbus Yeah, that's what I hear yeah, Neil you remember a couple years ago maybe one or two a guy was driving down 975 It was depressed wanted to commit suicide and he jumped into his pickup truck with a six pack Started driving down nice 75 the wrong way right. I remember that yeah, sure Dude stuff like that that makes me think I don't understand why alcohol's legal in my one is not right I was saying my smoker good point real quick. I think how much we'd he would have had a smoke for the same effect think about it How long I would have taken real quick. Neil. I heard you are song about tongues Religious tongue speaking in tongues and that kind of gave me a flashback Yeah, my mom's that we used to be a penicostle and I grew up and I mean I remember seeing my grandmother my my mom and just like talking and tongues and dropping on the floor And I would just fit there and giggle You know, I made no sense to me with so error Anyway real quick, Neil It's enough to give me the heby jibis just like you a song once it was for the Panthers no said to and I got another one Please let me sing it. Okay, go ahead. Okay. I'm Chris Weber I'm Chris Weber God arrest it for a bag of red hair I'm the ghetto dream to play be ball with auto drug scream I'm Chris Weber. I'm Chris Weber Call them out when I got sprayed with pepper burn my eyes that's mean How about a couple drops of visey I'm James Brown. I'm James Brown. Neil. Yeah Including the fact in the turf. Here's Miami Springs hello Yeah, hi I was calling because I heard the guy talking about The fact that it was legal and it was legal It's it but you know, I don't I don't smoke marijuana having done since college days, but but the thing is I'm a firm believe that As long as it doesn't kill you and you're not harming anybody else go ahead and do well Let me ask you this. Can you go into a drugster right now and buy rat poison? I guess yes, yes, yes, you can and that will kill you and you know it's got warning labels on the on the can or whatever You're buying it and you can go you can go into any story you go to a supermarket You go into drugstore and buy legally all kinds of substances that will kill you You can go into home Depot and buy paint thinner and if you drink it it will kill you I guarantee you that make no mistake about it So the idea that something may or may not be harmful for you, which is all very subjective by the way And a lot of it very dubious and debatable, but since when is that the guy the only job that I see the government is to tell us You know give us the information tell us can this be harmful to me? How harmful is it and then let me make my own goddamn decision? Well, that's what I'm saying You know the thing is is that the only reason it was made illegal It is because it's relatively easy to grow and difficult to tax yeah and by the lobby The lobbying of both alcohol and cigarettes which it's well alcohol is relatively easy, but But the question of cigarettes growing it drying it out and actually making cigarettes on your own Almost who aren't gonna do whereas anybody could like grow plant in the backyard and they just simply take a few leaves I'm gonna dry out in the oven and then smoke it. Oh my god and Apparently that's what what they don't want and it and there would be a lot of competition for those two other industries Oh my god, we're as in in the back of it that's proving beyond a shadow without that's killing people every day Should there are people puff it on faggets right now who are gonna cook from lung cancer and Emphasima and we've warned them and we've warned them and we've had all those craggy voice guys The guy that used to play Hamilton burger on Perry Mason with Elwazard younger than I'm talking about I've died from lung cancer in John Wayne and all these other big much your guys that are croaker and if you you know They tell you that and you still want to smoke then go ahead be my guest and Just don't blow it in my face. That's what Monica said they're puffing on cigarettes too Exactly Have a great day. All right, okay. What are we getting all worked up about? That's just because we realize we live in a country where our freedoms are very limited We have a bunch of we have a bunch of assholes sitting around deciding what you can do and what you can't do and telling you what's good for you And what's not and then we have some idiots who are going along with that who want to be manipulated But if you want to be manipulated, okay go to some fashes God damn place go to some companies to kind of go to Cuba for Christ Go live with the Dell.

Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word I've all of the English words that begin with a letter F. Because the only word that is referred to as the F word. If the one magical word, just by it's sound, can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. As most words in the English language is derived from German, the word, three-kin which means to strike. In English, F*** falls into many grammatical categories as a transit of verb, for instance. John F*** Shirley. His meaning is not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective such as, John's doing all the F***ing work. As part of an adverb, Shirley talks to F***ing much. As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, Shirley is F***ing beautiful. As a noun, I don't give a f***. As part of a word, an adverb, f***ing, loosely, or in f***ing credible. And, as almost every word in a sentence, f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing. As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the verse of telephoto. As in these examples describing situations such as, fraud, I got f***ing that they used, carolot. This may, off f***ing. Trouble. I guess I'm really f***ing now. Aggression. Don't f***ing with me, buddy. This missile. Why don't you go outside and play hide and go f***ing yourself? I'm sure you can think of many more examples. Say it loudly and proudly. F***ing you. Five, 60. WQA, present the Joe and Bo Joe. Starting Joe Costello and Bo Griffith. In day, call 567-0560.
