A... ...thence of power manure ...hovers over this performance by the dolphin. I don't want to move! I need a football player! Don't you make a sound! I just want to wake you up and leave quietly! Don't let this happen to you! Today's National Football League crackhead athletes are above the law. Protect your family from the horrors of unwanted NFL players in your home. With the new Miami-Dalvin home alarm system. Every Miami-Dalvin home alarm system comes with a Julie Johnson steal of disapproval. I never met a criminal. I didn't lag. And if they can catch the ball and run with the ball, I'll throw something special. Take criminal athletes off the field and put them in a jail cell where they usually find God in the wife named Tyrone. But Miami-Dalvin home alarm system. See you on the gocractic report of jail. It's the 10.05.60 WQA. It's a very sad Tuesday in South Florida. And it's sad. Don't you feel like you just want to commit suicide? You just want to blow your brains out of the... Nope. I don't either. I'm on side kick like I said, Olin D'Amari. He just kicked him a little bit sideways these days. He's kicking side-sevel. And it's just... it just left like a... I mean, it was like no chance that we're going to get even in the game anyway. But there was like one last gas, a little bit of hope. And why should they got in back in it? Because all the Dolphin fans, those so-called fans left anyway. Seven minutes to go on a game, they're down by a touchdown at that point. That's before the Eagles kicked that last feelable. They're down by seven. And everybody went to bailing out of there like they had a bomb scare at PPPark. And then they're calling in Joe this morning whining. Well, gee, there's nobody left, but Eagles phased. There, well, I wonder why? Go tell me that you folks weren't... some of the ones that left there would seven minutes to go on a game. But at any rate, it's the same... you know, that expression neurotic repetition. It's the same with San Florida sports except for tomorrow. In fact, even a world series, I guess, was neurotic repetition because nobody cared all year just like 97. And then all of a sudden, just everybody jumped on that bandwagon right at the end. Where did me I send? Just saying thing with this. Anyway, getting back to the importance of how about that strong thermon? Oh, right! Didn't know the old guy had it in him. Have you seen that story? Yes. About his mixed race daughter, one of the great segregationists of all time. And he was banging some darky lady while we were getting back. Here's the results from my yesterday's pool. I think because it's a holidays because I got like this little scratch, I must say though that for an old fart like me, I made nice recovery. You must have been thinking for sure that you were going to get to do the show today. Nope. You weren't? Because I was right on the edge of a real bad head, cold. I knew you'd pull it through. I pulled it right through the window. I dragged it in here. And it brought me back to life. What's your take on a capture? Saddam Hussein we asked yesterday. We broke all records. None of the last number I looked at when we got out here. Remember we couldn't get the thing to to um. The sits still because there were so many people on the website. It was a 904. I looked at like 944 about a minute after 2. 944. That was shocking. Breaking even those alien records. How do you like that? Breaking poor little alien ethos records of his story and forming it to mouth in his audience. 1674 votes for a weekday pool. That may be also right in the, I don't know. Maybe you can check. What's your take on a capture? Saddam Hussein. It's fine. But where is Osama? Remember him? Osama Yamama? 563 votes for that? The whole invasion was bogus based on lies. Can't believe he's going to. Changes ways. No you're not. 544 votes on it. Whole Iraqi attack was bogus. That's one small step for humanity in one giant political leap for George W. Bush 295. Fry the pasted on Channel 7. Fry Saddam on Channel 7. Right in, uh, was Spookies the right pool in the switch. 168 is Spookies the right was there. He probably would beg and for it. And no matter the cost it was well worth it only 105. 6.2 percent. Guess who a Chris Matthews on hard balls which I never watch. But I was a channel surf me for the football last night. Guess who Chris Matthews made look like a real asshole. Who's that? Oh, two reburman. Man he had him stammering and fomping and the bumbling it was great. And he refused to answer the questions. Like he asked him about, you know, how come we were buddies with Saddam back in the 80s and yaddy yaddy yaddy. He was the good guy and he kept changing the subject. But I beat but I beat but I beat but I beat and you know, two reburman. You're a disgrace. You really are. And all you old Jews down there that are supporting him just because of the fact that he ate. He ate a couple of pieces of humankind a few years ago. That's really sad. That's pathetic. Just because he had some gribbinous ones in his life. You ever had gribbinous? No. You have never had gribbinous? No. Oh, come on. What is that? It's like, I don't really even know how to describe it. It's poison. It will definitely kill you. But it's like chicken fat. Like fried chicken fat. How pass on that one? Huh? Oh, I don't know what the, what the, oh, you know you like it. Believe me what I tell you. Although it will make you crap your brains out for hours. It'll keep you busy. Keep you out of turns. And the good news is the beast got his new king, Carl Bed from Dalamacros. Oh, let's hear it. He said that he, he and Clarence had a wild time. I'm new, Macros last night. Now will you the king, Coral or the queen, Coral? Oh, I'm definitely the man. The king. You to man? That's what Clarence said. The beast, he to man. Now, we got to quit screwing around right now because before we're given today's pool. And I'm going to play a lot of stuff today and take a lot of calls. I want to hear people ripped it off in today. When you love your life for four hours? Yeah. Where? I love it. It's the same crap every year, you know? If it gets a little old, stale. All the belly aching and all jpeaters, socks, and they've wands that socks and this one sucks and what's with those dreadlocks Ricky and all the other crap, you know? He, I never realized until last night just how grotesque looking he is. He really is gruesome. Boy. Not that it would make any difference. I'm an edgy and of course that's a UM thing, the edgy thing, right? That's a hurricane thing. What's you don't want to get into? Because you're a pipe. You mean, edgy? We are going to, we are going to spend an hour rip and Mike Rosen told today. Nobody's said to beston. I know who the hell that is. Oh, it was time. It was 322. WVM type. You made a mistake, Neil. You made a mistake. We're going to rip. Jayrow, Keat and Mike Rosen told it. It's a little on the inside hurricane kind of crap. No, we're not. You're just jealous of Mike Rosen told because of the fact that he's a big success now. He's a big superstar. What does he do? I believe he's a math teacher. He's a math teacher. Oh, a perfect math teacher. Please don't tell me he has a wife. I don't know. Does he have a penis? I sure don't. Anyway, we got to figure out we're going to have the van hit today. We got 47,500 bucks. Now did Miguel ever show his lovely anson air and tell you that we got to something straightened out that he undid. No. The other thing from yesterday? Yeah. Well, he said yesterday that he would. He said, just this regard it. I don't know why he did that. Oh, and also we got to rip Carlos. Now, there's so many Carloses in that place. We're not talking about Carlos the freak. That's it. That's it. The reception desk was an embarrassment to all of us. Even Susan Lucci hates him like poison. But, and we're not talking about Carlos Biner boy who they dragged out of their intensive care somewhere with tubes hooked up to his ass. We're talking about what is what's Carlos's last name, do you know? Carlos, I'm not sure. Carlos, pick Harry. Carlos, pick Harry. You are a total asshole man. You're the ultimate asshole. I don't even know if I've ever seen him. I've already dies on him. I got full doubt. I'll take it this and I want to see him. Every single time. Every time. At least he's consistent. He's consistently an asshole. Every time we have like multiple ball games on this radio station, which is how many times a month has happened. I'm totally man. In that studio right there where your fat ass is sitting, standing that chair, it's probably seeping all over that chair. And he's in there, dicking around with stuff. And as a result, the next morning when we try to get on with a show, since we don't do our show the same place as the sports shows, we can't get the damn thing going. Same thing again this morning, dolphin game and a panther game on. What was it? 1890 on AM dial line. Statopanthus lost with under 30 for the 58. It was on a surf. If you go up like to 2500 on your AM dog, you might be able to hear it. But I doubt it. And so we have all this different crap going on at the same time, because naturally it's the only way to get it to make enough money to pay me. So anyway, they're in their dick at around dilling around. I come in this morning. I'm sitting here and I'm not as early as when Georgia's here. In fact, I'm getting, I'm trying to get in the smart. What do I need to be here at 730 in a morning for? Well, well, what's the point for that? Get going. What do I need to see? Seriously, what do I am at? I mean, my bedroom is like six feet away from this studio. Here, what do I need to drag my ass in here 730 in a morning to, to confabulate with the little gravel of the spick every morning. I don't need that. So this is a lot better. I come, I come crawling here about 830. That's fine. And I'm listening. They got, they got the little dog is on there. Slaught enough that the damn, the speakers are bouncing off the walls here. That's how loud he was. I thought his gigantic head was going to come pop and right through this board. And I'm sure that Josh was probably trying to talk to me. And I couldn't hear him in a beast, but he beat, but he beat. But about, and it took about 20 minutes to try to lay on F. Everything that Carlos Vicari left there screwed up again. Every single time he does it, no matter how much we've complained and carry on with Duff and what clearance and all the other middle-level flunkies in there. It doesn't do any good. Because he's what's important on QM is not the new Roger show. Not the ratings, not the money. What's important is ball games. That's what's important. Ball games. The more balls, the more games, the more excited they are. That's what Greg reads all about. Because he's, he's not a dumb Jack. He's just a dumb Jack sniffer is what he is. I think they're Greg and spite of all of his womanizing. I think they're Greg probably somewhere inside of his psyche. It's probably a closet mug. And I'm saying closet mug. Absolutely. Because he's sure likes them. The guys with John Straps. He probably would like to shower with the teams. Is what I'm thinking. But get that Carlos Vicari out of our studio. At least puts stuff back together again to where you left it. I was just coming to you. He just wanted to, you know, make sure that everything was fine because he wasn't sure if he left it. Okay. Yeah, you left it all right. You left it the same screwed up like you always leave it. Okay, come in here. You're posky around with everything you get your hands on. And then you just leave it like a mess. Like a turlet. Could you please read the enclosed announcement on your show today? It is vitally important that as many people know about this as possible. It says very Kirchner. What is this? Committee to defeat Bush on that case, sure. No problem. Open assembly number three. 130 PM Monday to 729 to the FAU Grand Pom room.

That's uh, open assembly of 130 PM Monday December 29th in the FAU Grand Pom. There you go Barry. Thank you so much. And we got to figure out what we're going to do during the break. Put your thinking cap on your Keppella as your leaderman would say. And uh, figure out what we're going to do this van hit today. Who's going out on the van hit McGill or Scott Junior? I would think it's McGill but we'll find out. Hey Scott Junior, quit seal on our batteries. 1013 at 560 WQM. If you speak and have a big ball spot like the beast if you got a big glaring A, yeah, I guess it's okay to find your way around in the dark. If there's like a little beam of light, you can always use your head as a reflector. But other net it looks like crap. If you want to look younger and better than you ever dreamed again, there's one guy ought to be calling that's my good buddy. Chuck out for you. In fact, it's a holiday time. I'll give yourself the gift of here. This holiday season. Call Chuck and get that natural hairline system. It's the best there is. It's as simple as that. You don't have to make a big song to dance about it. Everybody in your brother's try to probably have some kind of a mouth you look in Muscad piece like the one you know who wears. I'm so good. Although I do, you know, I thought about it. I like that thing about the the mad dog is on between the toe and the load. I like that. That was pretty good. How about between the slub and the tub? Hey, boom! Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Trackled under shoppers, greedy feet. Get out of my way, you curvert. It was on the day after Thanksgiving. Before grandma didn't know she'd be dead for me. Every year we fell. We tried. Oh, she wanted was a player. Congratulations. You room Christmas. Or the baby, the he's she owned. Merry Christmas, Christmas. I asked. But when those staple doors swung open. When the new home, she was stepped on and bagged up straight to the bone. Ha ha ha ha ha! Grandma's now wide out of action. And the hospital, she sits. After her body is in traction. And she even needs a nurse to take a spitter. Grandma. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma had run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandpa got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. Grandma got run over at the Walmart. to warn him out last night. It'll be a John Boog Shambi. The boog myster maybe we wouldn't get boog on a hotline for another 30 seconds like those citilating calls during the Amarlins parade, their world serious victory. Let's see the boogster, how come I have? Is he going to be a chulas? Was he going to be in a studio? That I don't know. Hank will be in a studio though. How big are you? Hank will be in studio. Ah, this schedule is all skewed around man. You must have warned Clarence out. He's just way behind the eight balls. He just ain't doing it. I think I will say though about the boogster. You like him or not? He's quite a good one here. He's a good guy. Unfortunately he has to work. In fact this would be a great day. Maybe he'll call in now in a bat line and he and I can discuss what it's like to work with Dave Ann Boring. Chet's not saying anything. I don't think he could be doing any crossovers with me again at any time. If he fills in 8 to 10 like he did that one day. I should have apologized. I don't know. I got to apologize. No, no. It was fun. There's a lot of fun because I put him on a spot. I kept pretending just like you. Leave him in the last night with Chris Matthews on hard balls. He kept pretending he didn't hear the question. And he kept talking about anything else beside the obvious. See, I can understand why you stuck up to Joseph Gackie because like Dave Ann Boring. He's an ice guy. I like to roll out. But he's terrible on the air. He's awful. But you can't say that because you have to work with him and you want to cover your ass. You want to be like another Mike Rosenthall. But as far as Dave Ann Boring, what have you got to a benefit by sucking his ass? Nothing. So why can't you just... No, no, no, don't start doing a George thing and play that little... That ain't gonna fly this week. Okay, that's bullcraft. That's a cop out. Or speaking of a cop out, Dave the cop, give it a rest. For this hysterical facts about the pot laws and you can do this and they can arrest you. If they put you over the drugs, even if the drugs aren't yours. And all of a sudden, you know something it's a holiday's man. Just light up a little bit, Dave the cop. Out of control is usual, calm down. Now where are we gonna do the van hit today? I know that it is fine. I think you're pardon? Miguel's all upset. He says it's not his way. He's very upset today. I'm sitting about one. He's like yelling at you. Oh, about the ballgame last night. Is that what it is? Very angry. Or maybe he got cut off by his lovely wife last night. Maybe she cut it off. Maybe she finally wised up. Or maybe somebody else recorded him in a hall and said, Get her off the suspended list. Or she's been with Techmiggan. She's still on the DL, the SL. We have an SL. It's not the suspended list. It's the Schmitt list. Huh? I can't mention it's the Reno. So where is it? It's on its way to where? And what is that that you're playing? What is that? You just say you're a fact, but it's gonna be Scott Junior. Yeah, Scott Junior's gonna be out there with batteries. I think he's gonna be hiding you in his... Yeah. He's gonna be rolling around in his hands. You couldn't find any steel balls like in the K9 mutely. So he's rolling that little batteries around in his hand. Crazy person Scott Junior, you're really in your get it. Look at him. Just if you don't want to give us any money for abandon per rescue. Just stand outside of an in stare at him. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Wouldn't that be fun? And you'll never make eye camps contact anyway, Because you won't look back at you. Oh, I see. So another is before, I don't get this. I'm around to stand this at all. So another is we've been lied to again. I thought this was a place of art Tuesday. They didn't you? It says next van hit tomorrow. Or a little bit of two somewhere. That was yesterday's memo. So I look at it today. Scott Junior noon the two in the parking lot of the crawl square. We've been in crawl springs too, got that much. There's no money up there. They got a poison break was gonna go with this toy drive. So that's what they were promoting last night. So I figured we just go there. So in other words, again, we're just tagging along. No, they tagging with us. We're just an afterthought. Just like with the ball games with Carlos, Pick here either whatever it is name is same kind of crap. I mean, I realize we're not as important as the Panther Red Wing game on 1490 on their AM dial or whatever. 1980 on the dial. On a station that's got 45 lots that go straight up into the air. That nobody ever heard of before that we don't even know the collar. This is of any more that used to be WSRF back a hundred years ago when van Patrick at the Lions put it on the year. Did you know that by the way? Oh, van Patrick the late great football and outside the Detroit Lions. He was the one that put WSRF on the air for water now. I know Dan Patrick. Many years ago. About 10 million. The Dan Patrick van Patrick used to call them the Philadelphia Eagles. He was a big fact guy. He was good. I mean, he was no more Howard David. But like God. Well, who is really? Nobody. And we're really. He's one of a kind man after they made him through the mold away. It was pretty moldy. After they made that muskware. They threw the moldy thing away. Well, I bet you can't wait to see him again and bond with him tomorrow morning. You must have must have at least something out of your life when he is. And they like today after a tough loss like last night. And the mold myster isn't there for you like. Yeah, you know, scowl at in the morning. I can't wait. Do you like make eye contact with him? Is there ever any conversation? No, he he will talk to me. Well, wait a minute. How about when you ever talk to him? I'll be carried out of conversation with him. Well, you're really. What a guy. If I could probably should say, why see the papers when again? Something happened last night. Mo. That would be good. Mo. And the rumor I'm hearing speaking of Mo. Mo is that because we got all this problem with, we don't even know if Joe Rose is going to be staying on or not. That they're thinking I hope it doesn't happen. It's going to be when you when guilty move the Joe Rose. It's going to be the big with him. Okay. Now it could be the Mo. Oh, show. But that just never read to it. So it might be the almost show. I'm a home. No, I'm a home. No, no. No. And then we can have the mad dog between the tub and the shrub or however that goes. What was it the the towed and the load? I like that Mo. He's going to put some pretty good material. That's a lot of time too late. I think that's a trend. But what do you want to do? And then you're part of the rush you or anything. But what do you want to do? What do I want to do with what? You want to go here and to coral springs or you want to go somewhere else? Do you understand what this man is talking about? Scott Junior, why do you want me to send him sir? I thought this was a done deal already. I thought this was another one of your array costs. Somebody is smearing you with the which is usually what it is. Like that other bogus thing made yourself up about that. That was in the sports or whatever that thing was. Use me read the bottom of the page there. The bottom of what page. I'm trying to get what I can. So I'm asked to. You know, I understand right now we don't do that. Fine. We don't ever do that. It's a cardinal law because then all the salespeople every year try to like jump out of band. Listen to the sales guys. Why I don't care about that. Neither do I and I don't listen to you either. Okay. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so that we're, we're going to send your answer, okay? About pizza law. And we did, we just got through doing that. Oh, pizza law, didn't even, you're just going to look for a free lunch. You're absolutely right. You want to do that again? Mm-hmm. Couldn't hurt. No, I don't think they have. They have. They're on the ball. How about there's a, how about the corner of sunrise and university? Okay. Okay. What is that gas station? There's a, is a shell station? There's a shell is it? Broward and University. What's the one on the corner? I think it's also shell, isn't it? Yeah, sure, why not? One more, one more. Whatever it is on the Northeast corner of sunrise and university. There's a, a jazdation, look for the QM fan there from on 11 or two. Aren't you just send me the lutes? That wouldn't be bad. Only one way to do that. He's leaving now. So, hope you don't want to get some. It'll be there when he gets there from 11 or two. We want, we got 475. We want to get to that 50 grand before this week is how to, we're going to be really pissed. He's out, old man. Falsa play off this. Oh! Good morning. This is former vast press event. And, eventually, dinner will act al-gore. I'm here to set the record straight of a mind-dorthment of Democratic-professential candidate Jane steam. It's Howard. Bob-Bob-Oe. Who eat? The 13 is the Nathan Orter. And word smoth. Not to mention, he makes a fine sausage. That's not him. They former governor for mod. And one of the prestigious Michael Thurup Guzzling Contests. Never happened. Hmm. Apparently, I have ruffled some feathers in the Democratic Party. Specifically, with my former running mate, Halle-Bersan. It's Joe Lieberman. If there's one man in the donkey party, that's leaving more whiny and monotone than me. It's Jim Leibowitz. Joe Lieberman. I pulled this endorsement from a secret lock box. I did so after much consideration. Thought. And a game of rock-paper-scissors. If Mr. Lieberman is heard that I'm sorry. But Joe, Joe, Landonburg. Lieberman must realize, I'm a sharp political man whose choices to shape our nation's leaders are important. You lost me. I can clearly show the list. Mr. Lionel Web. Lieberman. And Mr. Bean. King. I love you both. Like a game-and-wood. But without the Rumpular Invasion. I think we're done here. All course viewers over in that no affiliation of the Democratic National Committee to elect the president. Back home. 1034-56-19WQ. And by the way, we got the Paul Kirtman story on our website this morning. These people are keeping facts and stories. Then we already have on a website. It's kind of like, thank you so much. But yes, are we the New York Times? Thank you. Assels. Here's today's poll, which we already got a bunch of votes on here. How do you think to capture a Saddamal effect of 2004 election? Five choices for you. Big Booth for Bush puts him a far ahead. It's too early to tell lots of Schmidt happens. No difference. The Democrats are way behind the eight ball. That's what I voted. They're going to get their a crap together. Or Bush is in. He's in. Like Dan Rathers said, games set and snatch or something like that. He said, Sunday morning. Hey, Dan, book up a little bit. You asshole. God, I'm starting. Whatever little respect I had for him, which wasn't very much. I'm starting to lose it all real fast. Just like whatever little respect I had for Carlos Fakiri. Which I have no idea who he is. Here's the results so far. How do you think to capture Saddamal effect of election? 122 votes while I wasn't even looking. It's too early to tell lots of Schmidt happens. 60. The Democrats are way behind the eight ball. 21. That's right. Right. Correct answer. The big boost for Bush puts him far ahead 20. The interesting thing is not only doesn't seem to put him far ahead. For those of us who are praying that we don't have to go through four more years of fascism. But that big rally that's not a rally like yesterday. This is a run out market. It's actually went down a little bit. Anyway, a big boost for Bush puts him far ahead 20. Bush is in 14. And no difference. 7 out of 122 votes. Strong thumb and one of the great segregationists of all time. The racist group ball bastard who died last June at the age of 100. The late Senator Strom Thurman's family yesterday said it acknowledges a California woman's claim that she is his illegitimate mixed race daughter. Her lawyers said the statement brought her a sigh of relief. As Strom Thurman has passed away cannot speak from self-determined family acknowledges Miss. S.E. May washington Williams claim to her heritage. Miss S.E. May. Oh, that sounds like something from gone with your wind. Huh? I mean, now it's like Laquitia, a name's like that. Who had however ever heard of S.E. May? We hope this acknowledgement will be enclosure from his Williams, the family's lawyer J. Mark Taylor said in a brief statement. Contacted as or a facilitator confirmed he was speaking for the Thurman family but refused to give the tailor answer any questions, including whether the family was in fact verifying the claims of Williams. A 78-year-old retired teacher lives in Los Angeles. I guess back in those days in the day L.S. may was like a more popular name than Laquitia. Interesting part of this whole deal is where to hold is it? In seven decades of politics, Thurman gained payment information as an arts segregation as the later came to support a holiday for Slain Silver by Thurman Luther King. When he became seen, I was on a cent of floor. Williams claims Thurman fathered her with now listen to this. When he was a 22-year-old, L.S. parents-home and Edgefield, her mother, Carrie Butler, had been working as a maid in the Thurman's home. Guess how old the mother was when he knocked her up? Hold. 16. Huh. 16. Here is a right way in course he's dead now. I hope he's rotten and hell. I hope the worms are really having a good field day. Right wing, holier than thou, miserable, bigoted nasty rotten races son of a bitch, Stromtherman, and he and knocked up this chick, this black girl, she was 16 years old. How young is Thur young? Oh, I don't want to say he was like a hypocrite, but at least the one good thing is he's a dead hypocrite. Stromtherman, you phony band student, you're all the same. They're all doing it. The only difference is that some people admit doing it, and some people are too stupid to cover it up like take the dress to the cleaners. Anyway, let's see. Also, we got Joe Costellum, night 739, 30th, the glory hold, the glory day's grill. 47, 46, North Congress, seven, and that sounds like Palm Beach to me. Doesn't even see where the hell I like this, is that in a bointon? Yeah, I think it's in bointon. Man, I'll tell you, I know it's the holidays, but boy. Some people are similar to me, girls under a lot of stress with what your name be on a suspended list. 47, 46, North, would you stop playing that? What that is, that? Well, that one I know, but what's that other thing you're playing? That was just the same thing. Sounds like you're spinning a dreadal on Clarence's ass. That's dumb ass. He was just in here actually. I said, we're doing one. Hi, John, by the schedule by the way, Clarence Man, you really must be worn out for Last night's breaking into that new King Quill bed with a beast. You must just worn his ass out. And by the way, can I ask you that question? The Diane Sir wanted to know, can you describe to us just how smelly the whole is? I say that because I'm never going to let that thing go. I can't believe it. That's journalism, baby. That's America for it. A brilliant journalism. Can you imagine on the BBC, one of those distinguished reporters saying, Can you explain to us, I guess exactly how smelly that whole is that you're standing by? And I love the way that all these assholes from the various networks, the photo ops they give me, to you see them all crawling down to the wall. Yeah, Robert's an unseen and crying. Right. And trying to get an acrolym of the spider hole. Man. Anyway, so Joe and will be at 7393 to DiGloride's Real 4746 North Congress Avenue in Point and Pete with our best in the year, which you won't get any money for that.

Mad dog's probably like the liken is wounds after last night anyway. What would think? Can you imagine the embarrassment and humiliation? I will say this to take the made of the game. You know what I mean? I didn't expect that. Because the Eagles are a far superior team. And they made it again. It was pretty entertaining. And when it was 24 24 for a thought. Well, let's say, you know, they could luck out. But did they luck out? No. Because the cream rises to the top. You know what I'm saying? Just like when the Patriots who I played in those two times. They had their chances. Couldn't do it. They took. You could hear those gagging and choking sounds all over North America. Hey, it's that great time of the year.

Thank you PR for reminding me to play that. Get everybody whipped up for Sunday. He also mentions and he's got a good point on the Northeast corner of sunrise. University is a Chevron. That's what I was afraid of. On the Southwest corner is that shelf station. And you'll have more traffic at Shell because they're always busy. They have crispy cream donuts. All right. That should do it. Kago. Ha ha ha. Let me say it again. Let's do the shelf station on the Southwest corner of sunrise and university. Okay. That's where we're going. Chances Scott Junior gets that right. Get whether it's Scott you jackass. Well, let me face it if there's crispy creams there. He'll fight it. Okay. 171 votes on a pole up here, which I only mentioned one time. Man, it must be something going on. You think there is? I don't know. How do you think the catcher is Sodom affected 2000 for election? It's totally the tell lots of Schmidt happens. 78. The Democrats are way behind the eight ball 34. Big boost for Bush puts him far ahead. 27. Bush is in 21. No difference. Only 11. Only 11 people say they can make no difference. We'll see. But a lot of Schmidt can't happen. That's for sure. Let's see. Here's the fact. New Jersey. It wasn't a news jersey by the boys in Pennsylvania. Be your close. The big bear how I see. New Jersey's big bear hunted with 328 confirmed kills. Vice President dictating reportedly killed more than 70 farm raised. Ring that president stirring her can't hunt. That wasn't Pennsylvania. We had that story on. I thought this was like something new and different. Not again. Think sure we had on days ago. Days ago I talked about that. Jesus. God Almighty. President Lincoln still hasn't seen the second act of the play yet. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T. Guess what else we're going to have to chew on this week. We said those trans coming out Thursday. That's a one o'clock Thursday. So we won't really be able to directly about that until Friday at length. Formal charges against Michael Michael expected this week. Formal charges against Pop star Michael Jackson will be filed late Thursday or early Friday. They Santa Barbara District Attorney's office had yesterday. VA Tom Stedden send the statement the charges would be filed in Santa Barbara's county superior court in Santa Maria. A working class town post ejections never land range. SNEDN earlier had put to file charges this week and scoffice actions. His case was falling apart. Everything will become clear when the charges are filed. He told her CNN's art here as nearly two weeks ago. Monday's statements had a news conference will be held tomorrow to clarify exactly when the charges would be lodged. So they're going to hold a news conference to tell you when they're going to make an announcement. And I think today later on they're going to hold a news conference to tell you what time they're holding tomorrow's news conference. Must be some slow news days this week. I guess it's a holiday. Okay, let's get a whole bunch of calls. Thousands of them before we get to the Rush Limbaustary. 567, now line one is working. I'm pretty sure about how come at the CNN? I don't know. It didn't work that well in the morning show. Oh really? I'd like to let that sound though, don't you? I thought we had a sound of the dial film, but just kind of the way of like kind of feeding back ribbon. Yeah, it was really good. Let me try it again. I'll leave punching out. See how that sound. 611? There's like a reverb on here. If you're like I'm on WADC without the money. 567, 056, so line one is like a half in and a half out. Okay? Got that for fix it. If he ever decides to show up, it's half in and a half out fix it. Kind of like a clearance was this morning when the beast woke up. Oh, I think I touched on a raw spot there. You know what I'm saying? I think I did better check yourself when you get home. Always good, especially somebody fattened squat like you. To have the rooms that have the mirrors all the way around. That we can just kind of like squat down and look to straight behind you. WDQAM helps. Hello. That was pretty funny, Neil. That's why they call it the rearview mirror. Yes, sir. All righty. Oh, you're happy. Oh boy. They've freed me. Oh, you're happy. Oh boy. They freed me again. Major asshole. Flat boys neighbor. Die, die Dave. Die just before the holidays will be really good. Just before Chinooka. So we have something to be grateful about. WQAM. Not there. They also like that. Look at that. What is going on with this phone screwed up today? We may have to play comedy bits all day to phone as a mess. WQAM. Hey, got a quick question. There is one that works. Yes, sir. Hey, I'm up in a foreign beach. I'm so sorry. And yeah, I'm happy one of the porkers up here. Um, what time are they going to have to van up there at the, uh, give her what? I think Lori Holdrill, 730 to 930. Oh, no. Yep. All right. I'm on days may roll soon by their later. Excellent. Say how did you get my kiss for us? All right. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Oh, you haven't seen him yet. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. I think it's going to be a lot of fun with these phones. They based that in a way they sound. See, because it's the holidays. And obviously, nobody really cares. We don't give a Schmidt. So we're just, you know, we're just fun and you. We just have a little good time before I bail out for a long, instead of vacation at the end of the year at the SN. George, uh, we'll be on all business week. That'll be good news for Teddy Botswana. Hey, Teddy, get your blow up. They'll already for next week. Man, you can be hopping on it for four hours every day. Ten to two Monday through Friday next week. George will be with you all day. Although, let's see. Now, what, uh, that can't be right. What happens? What do we have? We have, like, ball games on Christmas day or what? Next Thursday, December 25th is Christmas day. Okay. Yeah. Nobody works on Christmas day. I probably will. You will? I'll get you. I work on Christmas. I'll be damned. And of course, this Friday is the beginning of Tenuka, right? Yep. Friday night at sundown is it? But we got that Dave Stars Panthers hockey game on it. We also got the Humperwoody Day Wands That Show. Very, that should be good. Although hopefully if they're at least on the Dolphins part, if there, if Wayne's got any brains at all by Friday Dave Wands that'll be back in Chicago with a banjo on his knee, he'll be long gone. Why is he waited so so long? You think? What's he waiting for? Dave's a good guy. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. So in other words, only the good guys should have the jobs no matter how inept they are, like they've been boring and Dave Wands that. And that'll be at the world to be so much better place. I mean, you know, everything will be really crappy, but at least, I'm trying to think of somebody who's not a good guy who ought to get canned. Oh, one name comes to mind immediately. Would you agree, yes? Well, what happened to Dave? You probably, you, you, you have probably, you and Clarice will have to race out the door down the elevator, hand in hand, arm and arm and race home to hop on that new Kingcrummel mattress again. Just as a celebratory gesture. God, can you even begin to imagine the parties that would break just spontaneously all over the building on that day? Yeah, they hate to like poison mo and take it from the tub and the shrub and the toad and the load and all and other crap. I do like that thought I was cute. Yeah, the mad dog is on a new two to four sandwich between the toad and the load and the. Yeah, there's New York writers come up with that. Did he really? Yeah. Moe Corske did me with us this morning because he was resting his aching old bones after a long desperate night last night. I wonder if he was belly aching about the officiating. I was who was actually cuddly with Jay. Was he really? Would Jay roll peach? Not exactly. Oh, would Jay feel her and Jay roll peach to vote Jewish. Maybe he had Jay roll peach to let him have one of them tickles. WQAM. It's about that. Haven't heard from him in quite a while, Moe. Happy holidays to you, sir. WQAM. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I have a poll suggestion. Yes, sir. For a future poll. Always open for a good poll. Well, with the. The clearance is with the cellular phones that you can take your number and one. It would be like a two-part poll. Are you going to do it? And if so, who are you going to, which would tell us, you know, who people think is the best cellular of up there right? And they could, and then there could also be a choice. I don't have a cell phone. And there could be a choice. No, there are nine. I know it comes to the shock to you, but there actually are a few people. There are a lot too. Don't, who don't have a cell phone. There's one or two, yeah. Right. Not two. Okay. There was a program on another FRAM station. And a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday morning where they were evaluating cell phones. Right. There's cell services. Right. And I couldn't listen to it all, but. I mean, now that you can do it, I'd like to, I'd really like to hear what the population is there. You know, thanks, Rob. You're the best. That's a good suggestion. We'll do it soon. Thank you, sir. Thanks, Pally. Have a great holiday. Keep up the good work. All right. Bye. That is a good idea. Don't you think? I mean, it's not circulating. It's not like dynamics. It's not controversial. But I think, you know, it might be a little bit useful. That is the case. Maybe it'll kill a poll one day. And then we can get people to call it on their cell phones. We can find out what kind of service they got, what kind of phone we're using. And we can see how crappy it sounds, which in almost every case it will be our fall to equipment. It'll be a fall. Like it is today. I can't believe how bad it was. In fact, line one is ringing. This ought to be really good. QAM. Hello. Neil. What look how good that is? There is a bell. Yes, sir. Hi. I don't know if you discussed this yesterday or not, but I don't know if you noticed you as double-speak the 1984 or well-earing thing the government is giving us that they discovered, sedums, we're about by rounding up this family and close associates and conducting hostile quest units. Yeah. Which I guess is the nice way of saying that we torture people. Right. We plucked out their eyebrows in their fingernails and we said, well, how, how, when you want us to stop. Right. They asked them, well, who's going to get the 25 million? Oh, no one's getting it because they didn't volunteer the information. We dragged it out of it with hostile questioning. Well, no, they said the 25 million they can't give because the person who actually gave the exact location is already in custody for a huge terrorist act. So that's what they claim. Yes. So basically, we're the good guys, but now we torture people. Right. Is there any doubt? In fact, they had a guy in last night. It was talking about the psychological what they're going to do to Sodom now. They're not going to torture them because they would look, make us look really bad if it got out. But they're going to do all sorts of things just short of that. Like put him in a room where he's disoriented and put water on the floor and have really loud music like in a clockwork or stuff like that. And did you know it's how strong he looked in the video yesterday? Yeah, look, they said disoriented. Yeah, it disoriented because they're pumping him full of something. Ha ha ha ha ha. Have a great day, pal. Okay. See you. Hey, we wouldn't do that because we're America, baby. We used to be great. You're my normal. This is for Twitter. You're my secret. You way of. Hey. Stench of pal manure. Pover's over. This performance by the dolphin. Unmustacably. This is television at its bed. So what is the message there? The message is that there are no loans. There are things we know that we know. There are no unknowns. That is to say there are things that we now know we don't know. Strong. Be willedering words. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know. We don't know. It merchants to be. Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? I'm just talking. This is Robotic Words. This has been a presentation of ABC News. Hey, my dear, I'm thrilled. I hope everybody had a chance to take a puke at that. The picture of him shaking Sodom's hand. It really tights on our website on mirroredgers.com. 1983, 20 years ago. Shake it a hand. It's crazy. He was our beloved buddy over there. He was our ace in a hole. Now he's the ace in a spider hole. I just love that thing with the deck of cards. Oh, he was the ace of spades and Brian. Okay. Like a bunch of children. Speaking of children, Dave Heiz neighbor, Facts is in. I haven't listened to your show in a few months. No, call either. Oh, yeah, right. In a few months. You should live so long, Dave. Well, I was there. When I was out there in November. We were getting facts from him. Someone has told me that someone calls you show and you think it's me. It's not. I respect you when you show too much besides I used a facts not the phone. Regardless, Jeff Heiz neighbor, David. Right. Who's are you? No, he's listening right now. Hey, David. Hi, how are you? Get a life and it's not like that. Jeff Heiz former neighbor. Isn't that something? If that was your the thing you're tagged on your life. What did you do in your life? What were you known by? Oh, I was Jeff Heiz former neighbor. That's what made me known. That was my thing in life. Wouldn't you probably like just blow your brains out? Something to think about, Dave. Limball wants to keep seize medical records private. How do you like that? Tom.

The rate data get out of your system. Once you're all those doll fans call in whining and whipping and moan today, right? I like the whole station doing that all day today. If they're going to be great, that'd be awesome. Having a cry fast. And then I heard that one guy call in Joe this morning whining about the officiating. You must have been the officials. Can you believe that? Good. Golly Miss Molly. It's always somebody else. It's a bad call. It's a crappy break. It's this. It's that it's not the gagging. See somebody with the Eagles kept doing it. Are you worthy of that on their helmets? They had calendars, like their large small page of counters. They said December on top. No way. Yeah. That's awesome. It's a good idea though. Yeah. So, it's a good idea though. Success it to the bills on Sunday. Soon as the dolphins manage, soon as that defense gets out there and it'll obviously say, Oh, December, they start gagging and choking and puking on it. Did the Mark Duper bring any of the good stuff last night? I don't. I'm sorry. Anyway, I did get it. Isn't it something how we're just supposed to forget about everything? He's a good guy now.

Cecil Liddissel's coming back. In fact, he's going to break into one of the eskab boxes in the middle of the night. Probably try to attack a Marty. 244 votes. How do you think the capture is sad. I'm a little affected 2004 election. It's too early to tell. Lots of Schmidt happens. 118. That's a good choice. The Democrats are way behind the eight ball 48. I voted for that to be spoken for that. They got a long way to go to get with it. Get with it. I'll a one good thing though. I'm serious. I hope that at least a few people saw hard balls last night. I've heard man. And so do I. Do you believe we're going to got just chopped up by Chris Matthews. Any audience you could tell was really aghast and most of his answers. It was just it was pathetic. Big loose for Bush puts him far ahead. The Sodom capture there he is again. We'll come both with all him. Lace 37. The Sodom that is. Bush is in 27. And no difference 14. Oh, look at that. There's Wesley Park. You know where he is right now. He's going to testify in the trial. He's in the needal lines. He's in the hay. Iraq is an international element's president of court. I think you have to be clear that that no. He's testified. It's a call. Slobby on the low. It can't be a court that can't impose the death penalty. I think the significance of the crimes. Mandates that that death penalty be on the table. Right on the table. In fact, just put his ass on the table and let the Iraqis have Adam. Just like the attempt to do with Mussolini, the only problem there as he was already did. 5. 6. 7. 5. 6. And they keep showing his file footage here of the phony's. There he is again. He wasn't seeing. There's the fake. It's like they're real sedan would stand there in the middle of a crowd. Not knowing who to he had a piece, you know? Who to he he can. Mandates people are crazy. WWE M. hello. What's up? Yes, sir. Are you doing first of all? That's a mobile on that sunrise corner. That's our watch. That's a crispy cream. No, no, no. That's not easy. None of these things. I'll be there. Um, did you watch the game? Did you hear that broadcast? That old seen how Michaels I used to like him. like him but it was called people by names of astronauts and stuff. Yeah, very well last night. When he just earned 80 al-micos, I think maybe it's time for him to start considering L. L. laying the mic down on the floor. One thing I thought Madden said when the first half was pretty interesting. And when he said that after fetus through a past that was like 20 yards from the nearest receiver, he said, you know, he said he's a tough competitor, feedler, but he's not accurate. And I thought, hey, somebody had to balls to say it. Wow, with somebody on this radio station at the balls that say one that should go besides the big old. He's only one when any balls that they did. And he, the end of the big old, is never any idea what he's talking about. So even he can see it goes to show you what a bunch of wins we got on here. That's a sucker. The big old giant fat dude that comes on later in the day with the fat just dripping off of him. Yeah. Yeah, I will not. He will not be critical ever. No, and Madden's worried about it. But wait a minute, don't forget you see, I'm not defending the load. But you got to remember the load has got to, he's got to interview the coach. So no matter who the coach is, he got to suck up because he does the coach's show. And then you got Mo and Madden on the dot who are employees paid employees by the dolphins for the broadcast. So you know, they're not going to whip the coach in. Should we go? We're happy. Remember, thanks, Jibben, when you went and looked at the turkey. And then you took that classic thing off the turkey. And it was just kind of like skin and fat. That's where the gang head looks like. We had the fudge just whip it off. Okay, listen, I've ever been holiday and bring some hand by he likes that too, even with not kosher. Rippin my poor friend the load. How do you like that? By the way, Hank will be on not as you will as today because he's dieting for the holidays. And we got Boogatoo, the Humperate 4. Ricky, William, sure what seven that should be really special if the Clevelander is a Daniela Bastard does a rim job on Ricky. And then you got the big old and he did a clock at a K10 and Joe Mark overnight. But his last guy is sucking up to the big, pretty embarrassing. The big old nickname is the voice of the angry fan, man. Is that what it is? Yeah, that's what they call him. I wouldn't know because I can't listen to him. He just, uh, that once he starts with that spanglish baby talk stuff, I just, it just leaves me limp. Anyway, wait to hear this. This alleviate limp even a pig like you. Contractor serve troops dirty food and dirty kitchens. Maybe not quite as dirty as the kitchens we saw there in Saddam's shack. The Pentagon repeatedly warned contractor Haliburton KBR that the food that served the US troops in Iraq was dirty, as were the kitchens. It was served in NBC News reports. Haliburton Kellogg Brown and Roots promises to improve had not been followed through, according to a Pentagon report that warrants serious repercussions may result if the contract didn't clean up and clean up the rack too. The Pentagon reported finding blood all over the floor. 30 pans, dirty grills, dirty salad bars and rotting meats and vegetables in four of the military messes the company operates in Iraq and B.C. said, citing Pentagon documents. So are we dead again? Blood all over the floor. 30 pans, dirty grills, dirty salad bars and rotting meats and vegetables. Any scallions or green onions? The report came as president George W. Bushfender off Pentagon reports that Haliburton KBR over charged $61 million for gasoline and sold a military in Iraq. Dick Cheney ran Haliburton for five years until becoming Vice President and Commander Assistant Commander in Thief. The company feeds 110,000 US and coalition troops daily to cost a 28 bucks per troop per day in B.C. said the B.C. said he could even eat breakfast for that amount. The Pentagon found unclaimed conditions at four locations in Iraq, including one in Baghdad and two in Tukrit. Even in the mess hall where Bush served troops to Thanksgiving dinner, it was dirty in August September, October, according to NBC. The public cleaned it up a little bit when he got there. When he had that fake bird. This adds up to a company that arrogantly is over charging when they can get away with it and not providing the quality of service that they agreed to do, representative Henry Waxman, a California tool NBC. Haliburton Kellogg Brown and Route told NBC that hostile conditions post special challenges as they served the 21 million meals so far to the troops at 45 sites in Iraq. We've taken quick action to improve the company said as they burst aside that rotting meat. God almighty, that's unappetizing. That's the thanks we give to our troops. We're putting their lives online over there in Iraq where they shouldn't be in the first place. Is defeat them a bunch of rotting bloody crap. Lovely. Nice going.

They got problems and I don't say that with a delight. I think it's gonna be a sad day when hockey leaves South Florida But I think it's just inevitable boring some kind of a miracle You see hockey being around in South Florida assuming that they somehow the NHL and the players union resolved the thing even with one year off You're thinking five years if they're still in NHL is gonna be a team in South No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't see it But the commissioner was down he had so much fun. Yeah, oh yeah, the commissioner missed your blue sky See that nose is so big every time he looks up to the sky He can't see what what's really going on up there So it could be snow and five feet of snow in the middle and and he'd think the summer shining it was a 90 degrees You missed the great interview that Goldie did with the commissioner at the game on the big oh I can imagine a color of that time after that Kelly really give him a good lick job Huh Oh, come on don't be playing that. Oh, yeah, you're sorry actually Goldie did a good job Then had a little joke at the end and he said, you know commissioner here you're gonna bring the all-star game back to South Florida And Gary that meant a lot of the way it was funny up the button.

I'm inspired. You know what okay? You're gonna like this okay? What athlete was the biggest comeback ever to play for a sound Florida team? Wow, did that great? Yeah Give me a name to start. Well, how about Cecil Collins that works? Okay Fresh in our minds right now give me one more name. Well, you learn you got a fun orange for Lawrence Phillips. Okay By the way, but if somebody get that broad out of the locker already He's starting to make a lot of noise Lawrence Phillips Okay, now we're gonna have to Facts this I guess the error if you're gonna have to let communicator something like that. Are you ever even talking him? No I don't know what do you sound like you're in such a good mood. No, hey Eric's doing it baby. He's on top of it He's right on top of the goddamn buffet. By the way, I'm I just dug into another shake here Oh, another one was interesting. Yeah, damn good thing. They're delicious. They really are not bullshit. You know I and I'm talking about the audience and they don't make you crap your brains up. They don't have any malt at all in them Do not ever Ever get those acnes a dive bars. Yeah, I try that. I try that once and then they can shake me Me No, you're probably thinking of the advantage bars the ones that taste really bad the original icons once They taste off, but they don't make you crap at the new ones the begins with an E would indulge your in They make all they can do it like peanut butter cups. I try them once and oh my goodness. Yeah, same effect horrible Wow, I had a two hour session here last two days near Wednesday when I went over to a was it was like the end of the world I would have thought I was about 80 pounds easy So here's the next poll probably have some calls on us some suggestions one athlete was the biggest scumbag never play for South Florida team I guess we'll change it at one okay by the way then that player was something underwood right the defensive line then Tony underwood no Damien underwooders. No not Damien was not Damien was a major Underwood. They're very good. I am so proud of the base to me trius under it was actually jobs that to be trius, but I got the underwood Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha like I said nice going Josh the meat here's underword what are they what are they? The overs and unders under me just under or overwood I remember I friend the load my close personal friend back in the days when the Cecil stuff was going on and you know I can't get along great I love Hank, but he was so desperate to try to like, yeah Because when you get close to the team you can't be objective. This is one thing that bothers me about our station Is that we got too many people on you who are very close to coaches or players and you can't be objective like all I'm not messing in no names. I'm absolutely Like guys that have their head up J. Fiedler's hands. Yeah, our from Boca right He's not the only one. We've got some other people on the station. We're very very I get a use of that a lot we get some Dan marino liquors on there always no matter if Danny had a crappy game that always makes excuses You know, but the fact that a matter with Beckwin Cecil the story was going on and and the load said well Maybe he was just trying to take a look. Maybe just want to take a look When he broke into broads window, you know Anyway, I talked to myself. It's kind of like when you go into a department story You know and you're kind of browsing around on the salesperson comes over the may I help you and you say no just looking And so when the woman's husband came and said what you doing here, man? I'm just looking maybe he just wanted to get a look Really that was a bad moment. Maybe his blood sugar was about 800 that day. He just wanted to get a look Do Now speaking of people who are a little bit off how about Scott you and you're weird now. We decided where he's gone And we actually yeah, he's there. He's at the shell At the shell where there is no shoulder He said he's he's already there at the shell. Is that some where you know? Well, no, that's that's not gonna cut it to shell where there's a shell. I'm trying to think in my mind There's a show on broad and university We've been there but we already been there sunrise and university. Now let's see. I'm getting confused. Pine Island University. That's that's the shell. Right? I don't know. I don't venture to broward. So who knows? You don't venture to broward? No, I live in the MIA. I live in the 305 How can there be a pineapple and university? It's like they they run parallel. I mean, Pylon on sunrise That's where the shell stations I'm thinking of sunrise in university. That's one where there's a fuckpuckers on a one corner Maybe a Scott Generkin give us a call back and let us know there's a mobile across the street And I'm sure the guys right. I'm sure it's a Chevron next to those awful movie theaters there where I saw God How the 300 years ago? Never saw Huh But I'm we're just trying to figure out what we can I say we could tell the audience where the hell he was that might help a little bit or Maybe we can start a new deal when we do the fundraiser find a QAM van You had I would be good we could play where the world has Scott Junior right and only hope for the best None of us like far away. Okay, so we'll start like about I don't know when we feel like it maybe 1230 We'll change the poll because we gotta get some names on there to meet you as underwood. That is the guy that tried to commit suicide Why is it this issues? Why why is it that they always think they can we have scumbags like Lawrence Phillips because Generally speaking I think that people in professional sports really when you can't write down with they never met a scumbag They didn't like if they can help win them some ball games if they can put some asses in the stands Put some cash in their pocket solidified their job. They don't give a crap what you did or who you did around that crap Am I right? Why don't I just didn't ask you because you were your hook or a cool guy 567560 pound 560 on the AT&T Verizon line WQAM QAM You doing uncle Leo pretty good sir. Okay, I'll couple a quick point. So grievance would be good because you could need it on the ATkins Right, I dropped 25 and two months for the ATkins which is good I have no few mentioned that's the last couple of days.

I think you know something. I think the civil war was a waste of time I think that the North and South was a good idea. I do too, but yeah It's just you go live with these people down here and it's a shame. How do you thought the wonderful day kneeling on our feet the quarter soon? Zion is on Marks fits Patrick it says depregnant wife leader. Well. That was the accusation of course most of us believe in Mark fits Patrick Nobody's gonna remember who that was he was a I would want to say yeah. He was the backup goalie for the big user Mark fits Patrick I'd you think that we should put John van Bees were Connor because of his racially grotesque unacceptable comments I got him can from his minorly coaching job here in the camera. You know those after he left here. Oh Well, you have to do you want it to be why they were here? I want to put somebody under the river can vote for Oh, he hates him. He despises the user I can say that now he ain't never gonna be coming back to town. He hates Christian like poison Do you know that the day that he got in trouble for the inward all of that other stuff? I was on a plane coming to Toronto. He was on the same plane with his family Didn't say hello to me. I didn't say hello to him. I don't know why just kind of like looked other because then born again Christians I'm always like a little suspicious, you know and Then sure enough later that day or the next day the whole story blew about his big racist mouth Born again Christian, you know the geezer he didn't really mean it 560 560 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line WQAM Hello Mia. Yes, Michael cocaine Irvin Michael Irvin, excellent. Thank you. These take a big too happy about that though Yeah, they had the White House issues and Dallas. Yeah, he had a few issues. You know what I'm saying? Nothing really big just a little Little head cool like a bonus nose And you notice the Jimmy Johnson connection. Jimmy never met a scumbag. He didn't like Recently It's a big blow! Oh it's still like I can't wait to hear that you live on a co-pain. The former NFL Mac had a good much further drag, co-pain. Oh right.

I'm feeling excited He's excited He's excited And then he freaked out again Mark Fitzpaptic or Michael Irvin And that's the start You're gonna be so psychotic all of you when you hear this Baby Cardinal says US treated syndrome like a cow A top-edic official said that he felt pity and compassion for some of the people Surrounded according toüm F собlier The imperative of doing the law He would always have to do it I mean, that's one thing. I agree with him on that, but we treated him like a cow. What do they want us to do? Caterm like a nice Christmas dinner? I felt pity to see this man destroy the military looking at his teeth as if he were a cow. They could have spared us these pictures said Cardinal Martino. Seeing him like this, a man in his tragedy is about all the heavy blame he bears. I had a sense of compassion for him. See, they want things just like Jimmy Johnson. The Vatican never met a scum bag, they didn't like. Martino was referring to the video tape released by the US military. Martino was one of the Vatican officials most strongly opposed to the US-led invasion of Iraq. He said it was true we should be happy that the arrest is coming about because it's the watershed that was necessary and hope that this will not have worse than the serious consequences, but it's not the total solution to the problems that the Middle East he said. Martino said the Vatican hoped the arrest of Sodom can contribute to promoting the peace and democratization of Iraq, but he said it seems to me to be a loser. We don't hope this will repair the dramas and the damage of the defeat for humanity that it will always bring about. And it goes on and on. I can agree with him about all other stuff, but about he feels sorry for Sodom who killed hundreds of thousands, maybe a million people because we treated him like our cow. We looked inside of his mouth. Oh man. He said it was a fucking apart cell by cell. But that'd be great. Could drive that out for months and months, maybe years, make it into a mini series. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. So strong thermon, not cup of 16 year old black girl. It's kind of like shades of Thomas Jefferson all over again. Although generally speaking when you think of Thomas Jefferson, you don't think of strong thermon in the same moment. I could be wrong. And what do you think about that idea of going back to a separate north and south again? All of my grumps, they can have the south back again, all the red necks, all the yaw, who's the trailer trash, they can have the south back again. And the civilized people can all live in the north. Okay, we'll have to give some little extra clothing like I got here. Oh, the blades brothers. Brian blades. Is that the only one? Yeah, the receiver. Yeah, Brian. Well, there was two of them. Betty was the final. Benny in the jets. Betty was with the alliance, right? And Brian played for Seattle. And he went to his yellow. Then his works and said, oh, we don't have time for anything. I wasn't done in a certain, which is agent. He said, he's got to go out to training camp. He's got to run fast and jump high. Something like that. Or get high. Brian plays. Boy, you inspired me for the next bit. There's biggest gun bags. They got his shot and killed this cousin. Can't remember the name. Uh, did you hear the big news story this morning? The Coast Guard caught 50 illegal immigrants on a boat in Miami. Can you imagine illegal immigrants on a boat in Miami? Not really. I never heard of a thing like that. What a concept. Market down. Market on the counter is that December 16, 2003, there were illegal aliens on a boat. Maybe we got another alien. A little some for next year. But it would be great. Wouldn't it be good? Have another alien to carry us over for months and months of a week in the screen and yell on how we get all the more old, crazy, or cuban callers back in again. Go on. Like that. How many QM? Hello. Hi. Yes. Yes. You got another comment for you. Okay. I'm on Nage's Avenue Fort. Remember he said the UM guy was took a dump on that monkey basket in U.M. What was his name? Nage's Avenue Fort. Nage's? Nage's. I'm so pleased. Yeah. I know the thing. I remember that show when I was a little bit exactly. I remember that show when Hank was trying to be saying what's before this. She said he said he just wanted to look around. No. He was just trying to dip his wig. He said he said. You remember now? That was part of the ongoing. Yeah. He just wanted to dip his wig. That was before. That's how the hell I'm getting in that book of brand. That's right. It's like I was before the facts came out. All right Neil. I'll be good day. Thanks, Palau. Have a great holiday. You probably would be pretty familiar with Nage. Nage? Yeah. Sure. You should even know how it's smell. Probably you should know what the aroma was. What he had for dinner night before. You know what they say? Jimmy crack corn and Nage aided. 560560. Pound. And 60. On the AT&T. And Verizon Wireless Line. Got like that. That's a whole lot better. We'll change it around 12. About 30 minutes. About 12.30. So we find out where Scott Junior is yet? No. He hasn't called in to tell us where he is. No. What a jerk, man. What an idiot. I just don't understand it. How do I do understand? It's a QMF in a way. I mean, if you're totally incompetent, if you're like having got a clue, what the hell What would, what side is up on which side is down? You're hired. Believe me. She is much as I like Ferrell. A lot. The fact that he brought him in drag him along with him. That was part of the baggage we had to put up with. 5675. Ferrell didn't really bring him in. He just kind of followed. He followed him. Down the Hershey Highway. How do you think the capture's ensemble affected 2,000 for election? That's pool number one. Today we got 374 votes not too bad. It's totally a tell. Lots of shit happens. 182. We got 11 months to go, baby. The Democrats are way behind the eight balls. 75. Be quoted for that and so did I. They got to get with it. Get with it. Hop on it. Big boost for Bush puts him far ahead. 57. Bush is in 38. King set match. And no difference only 22. I don't know. I didn't know. The market is up a little bit today, but it has nothing to do with that. It has to do with the housing starts. They hit the CPI went down to 10 to avoid. But we had a record on a number housing star on all the other bullcrap. So that was up 61 and has that down about eight. The community anything? No. The good news is that Walmart said their sales for a In the cramper. Not good. Not a good report from Walmart to which we say. Oh, right. Anything that's bad news for Walmart is good news for American University of the World too. WDQAM. Right. Yes, sir. I have a. I have suggestions for your talk. Go right ahead. Ramon Castro. Ramon Castro. Yeah, he's the the Marlins catcher who's Oh, the rapist alleged. Yeah, I forgot all about that. He deserves a place on there. He deserves honorable mention right. Exactly. Thanks a lot, Pally. You got a baby. I have a red holiday. Ramon Castro, of course, again, that's still in limbo right. He hasn't got a trial. Right. Yeah. What have been so many, you know, so many scumbags and so little time. Who else was it to Dolphin said he used to snort the chalk lines? Who was that? Which one? Well, give me a name. I don't know. I'm just picking a number out of the air. Oh, come on. You got to know what I'm talking about. I have no idea. Okay. Fine. Oh, here's a good one. Nice going. My complication. Excellent choice. So they can suck. Oh, never stole a freight train. But other than that, he done it. It said he's definitely a scumbag and a soft load athlete. All the way. I don't think he actually played here. Well, he's a soft load a. Wow, you're right. Maybe it doesn't qualify. I never played that cross it out. Sorry. Never played for South Florida team. I'll tell you, as a scumbag and different category in my book. You can know most people would not agree. And that's the punch master. How do you Marlon send punch back? I just can't deal with a guy who built a gigantic statue. He was a monument to himself and his yard. And then number two says, Oh, gee. You know, seven million earplust. The three million at the first year's got 10 million ear to the next two or three years. I coulda that ain't good by me enough. Beep. Or he knows to keep my ass as fat as it already is. When you say the qualified. When you say the scumbag. Well, rumor. I've heard through the great mind. Yeah. That when he left Texas, he was completely had no money. Oh, you like every other professional athlete just got involved. Cash. What is she? So, you know, he needs to support the lifestyle. Maybe he's got a little bit of a yam or a yager problem.

I just wanted it. He was suggesting for a future poll someday, because I just, I've seen things that, you know, just make me scratch my head and say, what is going on here? What is the most ridiculous thing? People do to their cars, Neil, I just saw someone's car dressed up like a Christmas package. Really? The phone on the front with the, with the red and all around him. I'm saying, what, what are people thinking? It's a car for God's sake. I mean, the drivers they put on and the, the flags they put on and people are nuts. Yes, they are. They are truly, people who drive their cars a lot of them, like it's a traveling billboard. They got religious messages on the back, and political messages on the back, and the life and slaves and the... They got the little, the stuffed toys and dogs and cats in the back, and a rearview mirror with little eyes. Oh, man. People, I don't know what people are thinking. I swear it was a, it was a traveling Christmas present. It was, I just had to tell you, I think I've seen it all now. Okay, thanks. I love you forever. Happy holidays. You too. Anyway, just, it's like the people that go on a plane. They're going to wait for the weekend, and they got their whole life for all of their positions. Every piece of clothing, every chalky, everything they ever had in their life. And then they got 75 different debates. How are they going? Hopefully, to weekend. There's a reason I'm talking about. And the new deal is because they only allow you, most airlines maximum, two pieces of carry on. And so they have like these, the ones that break down. It's like 16 different, uh, uh, uh, suitcase. You know, 16 different pieces of luggage of all shapes and sizes, but they all like, uh, snap together. Like they're fooling somebody. Lawrence Phillips is running away. Maybe he's got to. I'm going to. Excellent choice. Peace of crap. We used to have a guy to call to show some old fart about probably died by now. We can only hope. Uh, What's wrong with Lawrence Phillips? And then every time he's done a contract, like with a Rams or whoever was for about five weeks, until he went back to jail again. Uh, I had Lawrence Phillips just saw it around.

You know, you're missing James Baker deterred there. Yes. You know, this is the same James Baker. The third who's the primary lawyer in Baker and Bob, the legal law firm that's representing the Arabs, uh, the Saudis against the families who are suing them right. You know, you know, it's not unbelievable. No, it's not unbelievable. He's a violent anti-Semite. He was the same attorney. They sluck down to Florida when they helped to fix the vote count in 2000. So when it's time they need to bring the, uh, henchmen out. It's always him. Yeah. Make sure wonder if he's got the pictures of whoever, or the interest of parties are with Dolly, uh, the sheep, you know. Yeah. Either that. He's got look at Brassie's phone number. Yeah. He's got a number of people who are in Bought to the defending the Saudis. Correct. Okay. We can take a picture. We just said that. Thank you. Five six seven five sixty pound five six the on the AT&T. Do you think that's the same Baker from Baker and Bought to the defending the Saudis? I don't know is it. Yeah. Five six seven five sixty pound five six the on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. What athlete was the biggest scumbag to ever play for South Florida team. Lawrence Phillips 14.

Uh, Cecil Collins got eight. We already played that. I might actually play that again. I love that. He was just he just wanted to get a look. He just wanted to dip his wig. He just wanted to dip his wig. Nice. John. I'm code. That's the load. The load. I wish I would have heard it say myself because of that Stentorian voices. You know, mole. Actually he can be really funny once a mile. You ever look at him? Cecil Collins eight Brian Cox seven Michael Irvin three Demetrius under was that appear. Brian blades two Warren Sam two and after that it's Maltate is out of the first of 53 votes. Maybe this pulling could go for all that big. I don't know. We had a lot of our audience who couldn't give a crap less about sports no matter what they'll. All of a certainly they know about scumbags. W to Q a n. The jupil scum. Sun out of bitch. Once an a paly once a queen always a queen but once an a's enough for you. W to Q a n. Hey, I lose the one then the nineteen eighties is all with the yawes.

My Spanish all the bice. My Spanish all the bice. Thank you so much. We'll get to it. Eric with that. Thanks, Eric. Eric on top of it, baby. Lawrence Phillips and Jose are like in a lip lock 15 for Larry and 14 for Jose. And Cecil's in double digits two with 10. He just wanted to do a dip is with baby. Bus through the window. If anybody missed that story, that was just their classic. Takes the screen off the window. In this. Oh, and then of course just like with everybody else. They always try to blame the victim. Oh, well, she was a loose broad. She was a woman of loose bad repute. Ha ha ha. All right. That's always a good excuse. Scumbags man and people who idolize and that's what makes me so sick about professional sports. If we dig it with salaries and the kind of scumbags that people who worship and idolize no matter what kind of crap they do. And a classic example we got right there in Kendall. Oh, Jay. Yeah. There you go. He's the ultimate. The pen ultimate scumbag of all time. Never played for a team in South Florida though. He can't put him on the list otherwise it'd be no more contendery, right? He would win. He would fly by these like they were laying down prone. WQAM. Hello now. Yes sir. Neil got. I haven't heard that in a while where you're going. Neil got. Oh, that's good. Good. Good. Well, you mean. No. The cloud with other with the thunder and lightning. You. Yeah. Well, you mean that one? Yes sir. Oh, God. I get goosebumps every time I hear that. You're a goose when you're good. Hey, you know, Mr. Man, you're leading somebody off man. I can't believe this guy in on your list for the scumbag for South Florida. The modern and he's on there. He's on there. Leave on. Yeah. Leave on. All right. I will chop one up for me man. All right. And listen, this thing with Bush and I didn't get to be elected. Whatever. You know, it's too early to tell. But I'll tell you how it Clark and Dean is all we got out there. And I think Bush is going to win again. Okay. See you. See you's right. How about Hillary? What do you say, huh? No. See this is what they're trying to convince everybody that Dean can't win. And all the sudden bull crappies and other Michael Duke caucus. I have I have moments when I have my doubts. But on the other hand, maybe this populist thing is sway as sweeping America. Maybe you're going to vote out all the incumbents. You know, just like Arnold one that we call thing in California. Certainly not because he's got an IQ larger than his thumbnail. Or larger than that stunt penis to head in that picture. 1256 at five 60 WQM.

Yeah Where'd you fly on it? For a lot of delibosal? Did you think of song? I did, several And how was it? It was a decent, the seats are very uncomfortable But it was decent, service was good, no problem What are they like real small, yeah, very, they're craminy in there Well wait till you're this, little, Laura Douglas of Ipswich Watched CNN to catch up on Saddam Hussein's Capture Neil Davis of Brighton Watch music videos on BET And Barbara O'Connor of Winter Mass just channel surfed They all watch from different seats on the same flight from West Palm to Boston yesterday As song Delph Airlines Lofer units of prize passengers on that route By invading its high-tech entertainment system Instead of free peanuts, passengers on the flight got free access to 24 channels The satellite TV and music and a music trivia game at the touch of a screen I will say this, you know when you spend a fortune for business class like on You know international carriers You know and then you got the your private TV You know what I mean? But you're not watching real TV you're watching canned movies And some of the airlines like Virgin Skier, Skaglannick They got like the TV we have uh, you're on the like of ECR Jet blue has uh, the dish too Do they really? I believe yeah While at one rate reviews from passengers the system has greater significance Airlines specialists say the rollout foreshadows a fiercely competitive battle For market share between song and low-fer rival jet blue Who's a not-roll Boston flight is said for January Both carriers denied that their business strategies are Fected by competition with the other but their short-term plans for entertainment tell a different story Song has its system on three planes and plans to have all 36 of its jets outfitted with the system for March by March jet blue's expected rounds to deal with a major Hollywood studio next month That'll give its passengers digital paper view movies that eat seat The movable preamp songs planned long to do now this is in coach right? I'm assuming they don't have a business plan. No, that's all the same right like Southwest The movable preamp song planned long to the second phase of its system which will also include paper view movies More games in the end downloadable digital music These guys are absolutely competing with one another Absolutely and they're competing with one another like dogs said Henry Hartfield a principal enlisted force the Reacher's in Santa San Francisco the good news is that once they're both rolled out you can have a better quality Traveller experience from Boston down to Florida than you have from Boston the West Coast or from Boston to Europe How ironic is that he said Jet blue and songs battle in Boston's been a long time coming both have made roots between Northeastern See the one thing about now this is from where for Lauderdale or Miami I think I flew it for four later now see this one. I'm talking about his West Palm, but See who don't want to fly from for Lauderdale And I think he'll make believe airport. Oh, you're wrong. No, we don't want to go to Miami They don't speak English there. Okay. Whatever you say. I'd rather fly from Miami since it's literally five miles from my apartment Right, and I'm just used to it. You know, I just do like my mirror I'm in no my way around there and it's plus you can't go anywhere from four Lauderdale. That's a problem But sometimes it's cheaper to get the Boston for four Lauderdale. Well when you make the big bucks Well anyway Jet blue and song have both made roots between Northeastern cities in Florida leisure markets like Orlando and West Palm their bread and butter And both actively compete with trouble legacy carriers like US scare and American Airlines by keeping operating cost and musters dirt cheap Does it have the fears in there? How much did you pay? Maybe like 198 Round trip yeah 198 round trip to Boston yeah, that is unbelievable God Passengers on yesterday's Palm Beach to Boston flights that they were Santa Sky will go as Already on board. I think it was a good innovation. I wonder why took them so long to have it said Richard Malatesta who will company to counter unaflight Malatesta city flip channels Catching up on news and sports for the whole three hour flight that would be sensational I mean like air Canada was don't give me wrong.

Oh, yeah, this guy's got confused He's got his sports nerd stations all confused very good beasts about time you've put your thumb on something Yeah, that was when Carl Foster ran out of money because all the offshore gambling joints have been advertised many more And so we had no sponsors left so it said bye bye Carl take your point one share and they're goodbye And so then they've picked enough from a Tampa from Orlando and you ought to know the guy He's the what's his name?

I don't care if they get this. I'm proud to prove some funny girls and this, but you'll be the one to harm me. I'll be unbottled while she's on top. I feel it, my brick, my computer seems to play. He hurried me down the chimney tonight. He hurried me down my chimney tonight. I want to rip me down my chimney tonight. Tonight. You ever kind of think about the guy tonight, when I really, uh, French kids just think of one person, okay? And make you really just recoil. Dennis Rodman. Ugh. Yeah, won't they do it? Well, unfortunately, never paid for a soft-blooded team, but he certainly could have made our list easy big time, but didn't make it to soft-blooded. I'm not sure if you. Yeah, he did. On soft-beat with a bitch. Who's the, uh, which athlete was the biggest scumbag ever to play for soft-blooded team? Jose Canzaco who played his high school balls in South Florida, 54. I mean, he's like pulling away in a stretch big time. Lawrence fell of only 37. Chris, he wasn't around for a long was he. Cecil Collins 36, just a product vip his wick. Brian Cox 20. Michael Irvin a dozen, dirty dozen for Michael. Lawrence Santin, Brian Blades Dine. Puddrodrigas six, we hate you, Pudge. Ray Lewis six, Samus Smith five, Murphy Morris five, Nigya Devonport four, Musana Wright, Nigya. Yeah, Wu J. To meet your senderwood four, leave on Hernandez, which I'm sure we spelled out, uh, I don't know, three. Mark Fitzpatrick two, Lamar Day, Atomas two, Ramon Castro two, we spelled Lamar wrong. Uh, Benny Blades two, and only one vote from Mark Tooper super duper got one. Pete's trying to bitch one. Gene Atkins one, no votes for Cleveland Gary. Bobby Humphries, Jamie German, Al Martin or Tony Martin. Everybody like Tony Martin. Good guy. And you forgot all about it anyway, right? See if I went abroad and up again, nobody even know about it. I'm making some little scribblings here on a, because I'm so turned on by that moth thing. Absolutely. Uh, with the toe and the load, seen mow now promotes me, and which at least he's proading me in Hank, which is something, you know, the fact that we exist, but he does it with just a little bit of humor, very little. Uh, when he gives the line up, Joe Rose next, because I don't know why he even mentioned Joe, because Joe don't want to be mentioned by him or see him or smell him. But I guess he just doesn't, that's in there saying anything, Costa, about Joe. Mad dog at the two to four sandwich between and then he fill in the blank. The toe and the load. I'm thinking like the shrub and the tub, or the shrub and the tub, or how about since he does the thing with a weight on Hank, how about the sound and the cow? Okay, huh? Not bad. So I'll get the audience put their thinking caps on as to where's the the week come up with some good lines for mow for the moment, because he needs help. Absolutely. And then Thursday morning, we got those trends coming out for October. I bought this a good, a September October November, which will be the pre-frailed canning trend, which probably would be pretty good. And then the December will come along. What's the latest with Joe Rose? What's the latest, Skettle, about your picking up in there? I didn't hear anything today. Well, I mean, just give a recap. Whatever you said yesterday, that you don't want to repeat, because you somebody told you don't say it. How many clearance whispered that in your last night at the moment of passion, that your new King Carl Mantis, don't be as flirting at out on the year. Don't be splurking it. And then the rumor is that Joe Rose went in and asked for a lot of my due to weight to 10. And the people at Channel 6 is managed, but there are real unhappy in B.C. 6, because he's got to do the 11 o'clock sports at night. Get up real early in the morning, come in due to 10 and see that ugly asshole mow in his checkered pants. And then I'll have to have people out of either. So we may still just when we thought we'd find an ester-cated ourselves in the latest Greg, we mess. We still are ever going to do an limbo rock. Is what it sounds like to me. What you think? And Joe and Mark really believe that they're going to be doing 80. They keep thinking every time there's a position open, they think they're going to get it. Yeah, well, I'm sure that there's some open positions that they might get. You know what I'm saying? Right, though. They keep telling me, oh, Beast, you should do the overnight, you'll love overnight. No, you don't want to be buried overnight. I never say that since you've already been on in the daytime, because when you're on in the daytime, see what Joe and Markets okay, because this is their first actual show of the net auto racing things Joe does. But once you're on in daytime, and then they bury you in the middle of the night, that's like a gigantic step back. It's like being pushed back into oblivious. Like if you were doing 6 to 10 in the morning, and then they showed you back to like 5 to 8. Oh, my God. Oh, you're just pushing this scorch when you're five, you're way up. You're managed. I am a pussy. 5, 60, W, Q, A, presents. Leave it to Beast. Starting whole Howard David as well. All live as gay Carlos. Steven J. Goldstein as well as and Ryan Lebts as the Beast. I'm old. I'm old. Hey, what's the hatch there? I ain't got no place to hang my wiki. I'm old, it's I had another piercing accident. Watch out for the bottle. What is the Beast's cleavage? The Beast cleavages up. The Beast's cleavage went wally. G-beast? You better clean that deep pedal before Mogete's home? Um, gee, I don't know, I'll eat. It's kind of achy. So, you didn't clean the peep pedal, huh? Yeah, fat little bastard, you tub a lot. You're walking, goi-duck. Told you he did so, I'll count these so hard on the pie. They came here Beast. They we had a little chat. Um, I don't know. Okay. No, you don't say anything to lump through what they standard. Okay. I said not to lump them, bocking. But you stopped, but I doubt right, that's it. Remember my friend here? Mr. Boat. Don't go, don't go, don't go. I'll do it, don't go. I'll do it. I said stop it. You can't go, I'll do it. You can't go, I'll do it. You can't go, I'll do it. Okay. But don't stand near the window. What for? Cut you right, folks. Ah! Absolutely. Love it. 157 at 560WQA. I'm okay. Double digits only. Which athlete was the biggest comeback to ever play for Sound Floated Team? Uh, Warren Sapp 11, Michael Irvin 14, Brian's Cox 27. Lawrence Phillips time for second with Cecil 43. They're just looking to edit their wicks. And Jose can suck a way off all by himself with 61. Now, I remember back when F.A.B. blew you off the morning show. Yeah, man. And he was getting calls because naturally we were telling everybody on the air. Exactly what a miserable piece of crappy was. And his response I would would be be careful not to give a direct lie. He wouldn't deny it, but he would say, Or do you get your information? Or do you get your information? And which is just a backhanded way of evading killing on his dancer and of lying. Is there any doubt? Is there anyone in the building who doubts that you were canned off at that show? No. Now, how did that come about? What exactly was the, and I didn't say it to your face though, right? No, no, no, no, no. He, he, he, he more goally never said anything to me to me. You, you just got it second. That probably is when you started bonding with currents is pretty tight, right? Yeah. And it was just made very clear clear to you that you weren't going to be invited on the morning show. And on the course was that before after Carolyn was ceremoniously sent on her way down the hall to power. Oh, that was way after. After first it was Carolyn and it was the beast. And then of course, Joe and Mark were pretty tight there for while and night turned on him. It's just amazing to watch like a bunch of dominoes fall. It's a beautiful thing. But I still say I've got to written down here. I'm really impressed. The toad and the load. You got to admit. See, you won't even chuckle, but there's some real creativity involved there. I think deep within the balls. I think it would take the must grab off and let's some air get in there once in a while. Just like his mind get a little fresh here. I think you might find some creativity in there. No. Now, how do we make out with speaking of mine with Scott Jr today out the EQM family. Apologize for being a bunch of assholes. We're sorry, but it's a QMF in way. How do we make out? We got to report? Yeah, five or four. Twenty five twenty. Yeah. See, we could have done. I'm not going to knock it. Nice. Scott. We stared out with forty, seven five. So we went over 48,048,020 for a band of per rescue. But if we would have not been all screwed up there in the beginning. If we wouldn't have to confuse you with Mark Eisenberg is going to be in cruel springs. And Scott is trying to find his ass with both hands. And got an out there right at 10 or whatever was supposed to be. 11 o'clock. We could have probably pushed close to a thousand. You know what? But we won't look or give horse in the end in the. And they are pushed. 520 bucks knocked too bad. Don't forget you go online and get your best. The number is nice on the aradges.com. Also when you're online, take a look at that picture. I was just listening to our dummy. Come on Gary Jr. Going on about he was a butcher. He was a murdery filled hundreds of thousands of people. Explaining why the fact that they showed this picture, which are nearly the aradges. Show pictures of captives. But they're showing him because he was a big fish. Same guy that's shaking hands. So take a look at aradges.com. He's squeezing it, baby. The boosters next. He's going to tell you all about how it is to work with the guy who's in a coma. Bye bye. Howard David's a bitch.
