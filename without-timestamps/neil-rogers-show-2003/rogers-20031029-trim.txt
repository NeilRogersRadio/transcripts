Those are not pionnes del mundo 560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line And we don't want to get any more that negativity in here because I always get blamed for that It's the audience that's negative. I can't imagine how negative they'd be if the dolphins won the superbow Oh my god, can you imagine all the negative things they'd have to say then? Here's Miami win as this Yes, sir I'm in a river, not the offensive answer I'm in a river Can't understand a freaking word he's saying what we do One peer wrapping I think oh, is that what it was?

It's just not our audience. I guess we have the sour push to do you think that's what it is? No See, I think that because somebody we had a couple of calls yesterday very bitter really bitter people Billy it can about the fact that and of course it just happens to be true that every time something happens in Dave County It always turns into an ethnic thing if it catches my drip Oh, great, right is correct. Every time anything goes on the first of all the Hispanic politicians are come on a speak in some language Which doesn't happen to be English and then there's all this other stuff going on that really has little or nothing to do with What anybody else cares about? I just mentioned that in passing so we didn't have a few people kind of porked off about that And then even the George this morning made some kind of a comment about what nerve the people had brought ahead and that newer for connect the newer for They sure are Anglo's all they show are about to Anglo.

Her savior, Muhammad al-Rahif, was outwardly understanding of her failure to appear during his trip. I know she had a very difficult time and her back and she takes rest, he said. However, Mr. Al-Rahif was been guaranteed granted the solemn and the U.S. for fear of revenge attacks at Iraq was reported to be disappointed by her failure to meet him on his visit to Palace Stein, West Virginia. The Lynch's lawyer Stephen Goodwin, who's not too crazy about them Palestinians, denied that rivalry between the 20 year old former soldier and Iraqi benefactor of a competing media project, was to blame for her absence. Absolutely not he said. Absolutely. This Lens' book I'm a soldier too, the foot of a gigantic publishing deal will be released next month and a countdown to a first TV interview until each time is already begun. But she's been beaten into print beer, Mr. Al-Rahif whose own work because each life as precious was published earlier this month than Yadi Adi Adi Adi, and a part of the history. So as usual she just ain't what the portrayal of the be but nevertheless, the American public life being lied due to get used to it. Okay, which current comedian you think is the funniest will be building this list I think I hope. It's Chris Rock 12 out of 30. What? That's what I voted for. Leslie Nielsen 5, I voted for less. Robert Williams 5, Mike Myers 2, Max Kinkldon, have any wind and Jim Carries, that I'm there yet for some reason I haven't figured out yet. Because there are such George Wires the list. Did you send him the list? I thought I did. Here's a call from Avintura, hello. Hey, Nielsen. Yes sir. I'm a photographer with two good buddies at Bar and Lyme with Mr. L. Al-Rahif, I'm running Lyme. What is it? I said I'm a study portfolio for all of the young who have written you real good this morning. About one. All they're saying that all you do is talk about a Toronto weather and just basically rip in your so good. Good, good luck to him. Okay, keep talking about his poll in young Ron. First of all, I don't talk about Toronto weather all the way. It's going to be pretty nice next few days. We got spring and fall coming back again. Going to be sunny like 50 or two today and it's going to be sunny in the low 60s. I don't talk about Toronto weather. You ask, hold some bite away. We still got gigantic ratings. See, you can try desperately poll in young Ron. You think that would all the stuff that's going on in town. Since they're always sucking along your sucking rich Sanchez's big fat pimple he asks and they're sucking on everything they can grab on to. You think that's what they'd be talking about. But again, they're obsessed with. Yeah, good. Use you and more power to him. Okay, just keep just tell my name right. That's all I ask because we're still kicking ass. Even with a little Georgia on for about half of the summer, we still kick the ass. Okay, Georgia takes all that all the lumps from all the malcontents. Oh, George's dope along on the air. George sucks and George couldn't do this. I don't know. And the main time we still had the highest ratings on the station and we still pick everybody's ass. And believe you, when I was on that station, Paul and old Ron, we had real gigantic numbers on Zeta. Not the kind of a mediocre numbers. You know, they do good. They do okay. But not the kind of humongous ask kicking beating everybody in the world numbers that we had. And we had a whole lot of competition back in those days. That's just how it's sperm. We're like, I have for dozen like major shows on here in those days as opposed to like one real competitor on the FM band. You had Joey Reddolls on against you. Hey, how can you beat that? That's right. Talk about stiff competition. Can't get stiffered now. I am that hemorrhage out of here. And by the way, quit talking about Rod Roddy Baddies dead. You idiot. 560560. What a bunch of overgrown children we got himself for. Here's a spy report. Job Paul and young Ron were talking bad about you. Neil, they said, but you talk about Toronto weather. See, that's what they're jealous of because probably both of them would like to be doing a show from any place. So, Florida, like maybe a real civilized place and begin to pay gigantic humongous bucks for it and getting big ratings. They're no one that everybody in town is listening to your show, which they're probably listening right now. And by the way, we're quit being a liar, Ron, or Paul, whatever it heard your name is. Casting old balls. Oh, yeah, I ran into Neil at the saw grass yesterday. And remember that? Yeah. Just haven't seen this man in years. Oh, it's speaking of that one I did see. It was at a panther game many years ago back in the old Miami arena. And that reminds me, I wanted to mention that because I see I live through the phony this and I've Tom back. Then. Remember those days? Oh, how could I forget everybody had the panther flags in a car. These were people who wouldn't know a hockey puck if you stuck a dozen of them up there as. And everybody was a big fan. And we loved a panther. It's really hot. The bezier, the geese and of course, you know, and they managed. And then, of course, Wayne's looking to everybody to build the building. Because we know that one thing about sports owners, they never ever lie to the public. Make no mistake about that. They always tell us the truth. And I'm going to tell you something right now. And you can mark it. Yeah. Mark this. You have a broad Connie would change their mind and decide they want to build this for some. Aha. I will not play here. Right. Because I will not have you guys. Looking at me for the next 10 years. And here's the guy that said one thing and went out and did something else. I have only one thing to say to you, Wayne. What are freaking liar? Parkmark bald headed liar. Snookered, but brow account and of course, we're all wrapped up in the euphoria of the moment. Big gigantic thing. And then we had to stir a couple of weeks ago, brow account and make an peanuts from that facility. It's all going into somebody else's pocket. What an initial question. Which the team has already been sold. And all that so called euphoria. Since they've been in New Building Scott, how many times have they made the playoffs in the six years? No. Once. Once. Twice in the old building in Miami. Oh, one great year. And then once against New Jersey in this and the board got swept out in forestry. Faster than you can say, douchebag. Faster than you can say, Wayne's a douchebag and nobody in town knows a crap. And you go to those games. Thanks to me in the free tickets. You see, there's, you know, marginal crowds. Yeah. Most of the time, if nothing else is going on. Yes. Right. That's right. If there's nothing else going on and there's marginal crowd. If something else is going on, there's nobody there. And when they're there, they're not watching the game anyway. And when they're there, they don't understand again. They don't know who the players are. They're there is no interest in hockey in South Florida. And yet we had that one year and it's exactly the same thing. It's busy wall over again. I'm not trying. I said all along. We were dirt in the Marlon one. I said it's good for the community. I'm happy for nice job. You know, all this other stuff. But just keep it in perspective. You don't have to like get all his steric of. Oh, now what can we do for you? Let's go to your stadium. Let's give you all our money. You know, this is in Dave County where a lot of the kids don't have textbooks to take home from school. And all this bullcraft that you people speak about. Oh, we care about education. No, you don't. The American public doesn't give a flying fig about education and don't ever forget it. Okay. That's why there's so many morons running around. That's why we got a bozo for president. That's why you look at the politicians that everybody's always bitching about. Who the hell put them in their first place in the way elections that weren't fixed? Do we ever have any of those? Well, if we would have had any. Like me or Pinga Picania and Joe Carrillo and Miseir Swar. The same tired old names over it over it over again. Dave County man in the olden days like on a beach and had to be some old Jew that was running for office. Or else, of course, now it's got to be somebody with a Z on the other name. D as Gonzalez a Swar as easy. Yeah. Easy. Does it. Solid takes. But how about Alex Gonzalez for a governor of the world? Yeah, there you go. What I call that we're playing by Dave Ann boring. Seriously, that goes to show you the QM we have no shame. How could we play those lowlights? You know, I'm sure many of those really great calls which boogus in Sation. But why are we playing those Dave Ann boring calls? Is that one that we just played before that three run home run by Ann Carinassion? That was, uh, Los Compionas del Mundo. Yeah, bad. Yeah. Wasn't that pathetic? Uh. I mean, we're talking about to play off. Maybe the second round, the road to the world serious right there in Rigglyfield. And it was kind of like maybe somebody poked him in the ass with like a kind of adult pin. Not a sharp one. Just kind of adult pin, a dull one. Ever get poked in the ass with a dull one? Here's Boka, hello. Hello Neil. This is I'm objecting you with. Yeah, okay. I'm a bad, full new voice. I'll go put it back in your pants. I'll, here's Compino. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Was that punch? Yes. Here's the punch. Here's the punch. That was punch. Here's four peers, hello. Hey, Neil. Keep it in my favor. How about those good old mile and pants? Not like up in the round to quite New York or Graysieven. Yeah, go back to that. Okay. Go back to a round of quite. All these Rochesterians. The only good thing about Rochester was Victor Derves and Donovan Boughs. And that was it. End of right wings and the amyrex. Don's Sherry and the amyrex and Brock O'Horvatt don't start with that hockey top, Mr. If you know what's good for. Okay. Okay. 10. I said five 60. I'm loving these calls. Do we have any new names for our poll? No, it's all right. Which current committee do you think is the funniest? We got a lot of votes on there already. Chris rock 20, George Carl and 20, 20, 20, 20, 20 as she says the illiterate one. Robin Williams 10. She's not a little rich. He's just the what do you call it? Retarded. Yeah. Mike Myers eight Leslie. The Ellsson six Jim Curry three and Max. Cankel. Who is Max? Cankel. I have somebody stuck this into putting that on there. It's plain to me who it was. I don't know who that is. And evidently he was anybody else. Something I do know horse racing fans. They're doing it at Pompano Park. They're open for their 40th anniversary season.

When I help my sheep, I try, I'll never, not to think of them. I don't want to think about these things, for me, always remember stop. I'll also think about human waste, yeah, you're in places. And, who? It's disgusting. I can't get through a nail. You're bothers me, I ain't the eye. I'll try that one, but I don't know. Hey, I'll wish him to mind when I am in trouble. Being someone, someone. I'll think about plus, flim, I've always been crazy on that. I'm not sure if I can get a new one. This is amazing. The fact that you did something, I just did the search on Max Kinko to try to figure out who the hell he was. He was a DJ at CKLW, and that's, so this is from the wrong freaking bowl. Remember that bowl? I'm not your favorite whole time DJ. Maybe you did some balls on this bowl. No. I've seen that on my working worldwide web. I've picked this facts up off the machines. His Tucker says, just for the record, Max Kinko is or was, a mediocre DJ, not a comedian. Used to be on K-A, what is it? Oh, K-Rock. K-Rock. That's a Howard station. K-Rock in New York City, where they had the classic rock format. Also was on CKLW in Detroit, Windsor. P.S. Mark David's, more David Samston all the time. What does that mean? They like that drop, I think. Do they like to drop? We did it! They like that one better, or do they like silly Samston? We won the World Series. Oh man. We won the World Series. Oh. Seriously, you could trap those right away. S. is in a butterfly and put him in a bottle. Probably we were with a lot of money someday. There you go. Be a negative again. They'll pick it on poor David Samston. He's going to keep the manager. He's going to keep the team in tech. This isn't 1997. What a bullden that is, huh? You even have to look at your calendar. 560, 0.560, 0.560 on the AT&T. And Verizon Wireless. Oh, wine. Wow. What was that? Right in stride there. It was a beautiful night. And you want to know why? We won the World Series. That's why. Because I'm so, yeah, more of you. 4-in gas. Stuff like that. Here's a call from Miami. When was this? Hello. Yes. Are you doing? No. Okay. Oh, no. That's him again. So he tried start with something else. But then he went, how are you doing? I'm not going to talk to you ever again. What you're just saying? And that was him, right? I would. He would never listen again. Yeah. Let's swap him for the guy that had been listening for 13 years. Allegedly. Who says he's never going to listen again? Allegedly. Let's make a deal right there. Okay. Let's get money hauled immediately to think. And let's do a swap and take the radio away from both of them. Right. And now take the phones away from both of them. Yeah. 560, 0.560, 0.560 on the AT&T. And Verizon Wireless Line. We're not getting any new names for our list. That's fine. You talk about whatever you want. We don't really need any new names for a list. I think we have a fine list right there. And if they want to add some names, that's okay. But like I told you because it's a positive thing. Oh, let's see. Here we go. Here's the facts that you're just set. Albert Brooks. Got him down. And Brian Reagan. Now I have no idea. And remember, Reagan and the other exorcist. Reagan. Yeah. Remember Ronnie Reagan said that he was the anti-Christ. That was kind of amusing. Who's Brian Reagan? And how about Billy Crystal? Yeah. Come on. Put him on there. He's got to kind of old and worn out. He's still kind of a music. John, please. Now we're talking now. We're getting some names on the facts machine. Because the colors are got important stuff to do. Like, you know, show their ass. So we got John, please. And I wish I knew who to help Billy Reagan was. Do you know? No. Scott? Yes. Who's a Brian Reagan? Yeah. Brian Reagan. Who is he? So let's get those on list. He's a comedian. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound five, 60, on the eight. And it is 11, 0, 5 in a morning. It's the middle of the week. All the festivities from yesterday are over. All the dilly dallying. All the excuses are in the behind at this point. Right. So how come the lovely McGell doesn't have any more information about our abandoned pet rescue? And about what's going on? I'm telling you, you talk about we are being sandbag. That's the word that I'm looking to use. We are being sandbag. Is he giving you a new number? No. I haven't seen it yet today. Any more information? Huh? Any more idea about any like events that we have coming up like van hits stuff like that? No. No. No. Now see we have it because it's not a sports thing. So it's not important enough at QM. They don't want to do this. You're right. I'm like IOD where we actually used to get some assistance from the other people on the year and then with their own CDs. We used to really have a major something we could be proud of. Fundraiser kind of a thing that we really cared about it. This station doesn't care. They just don't give a flying crap. The solution to part of it. So don't it? Unless it's associated with some of these golf tournament, they don't give a crap about to anything about raising money for any kind of a good cause. They just don't care. They may put on a good act for it. They don't even do it that way. They don't put on any kind of an act with us. Because they just don't care enough to send it very best or worse to anything else. They're just indifferent. They just don't want to win in here. Just like Clarence pretending that he didn't hear me hang up on Bug twice yesterday. And Bug loved it by the way. You're indeed. See Bug is one of those people he gets it. Unlike some of the people even though they've been there for a year and a half and I still don't get it. That's a lot. Yeah. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Here's a call from Coconut Grove. Hello. Good morning, sir. Yes. I want you this morning. Okay. What can we do for you three? Do you know George Collinant? No. That's what he. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. I was left in George Carl in before they popped your sorry ass out of your mother's womb. Idiot. You ever see him? You ever see this? No, but he comes into appearances and lurks and then reads it. Oh, for it's but he doesn't show himself. If you think he's annoying on a phone, you ought to see it in person. It is something. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Hello, God. Yes, sir. How about Gilbert Gottfried? Gilbert Gottfried. He's still alive? Yeah, he's still going. Damn it. Okay. Thanks. He's okay. Do you like him? Well, I like those out-flight commercials. Yeah. He's all right. That's about his, uh, he's got going. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Which correct comedian do you think is the funniest somebody you actually like? I know that's the out of your character. 102 votes. Here's somebody we don't like. Appreciate you, gentlemen. Yeah. Okay. Chris Rock 33. George Carl in 31. But what you have 17, Mike Myers 9, Leslie Nielsen 7, which is obviously the correct answer. Oh, now he's got eight. Jim Curry 7. And no vote. Well, take Max Kinkhal off it. Or please, Eric, take Max Kinkhal off it. I was, I was, uh, somebody's bad. Probably mine. John, please, and Billy Crystal have none. They just went on there at moments ago. And what about Brian there, uh, greasy? He's pretty funny. First of all, he can't get up every time he falls down, you know? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT. See, the one thing about the American public is they love being volgemented. That's why they love bush so much. They love being volgemented. All that's certain to change a little bit because there's a little bit too much volgemented. And too many innocent people dying. All over the place. Pound so many pounds of it. Right. That's right. I mean, you know, volgemented is okay, but once you're starting to drown in it, once once the aroma starts getting up to your nostrils and up to your earlobes, then it starts going to be a little bit kind of heavy duty. I get it. Here. With a dump. Oh, no. Let's go home. That was unfelivable, man. That was almost as good as anthrax. Yeah, almost. Oh. Thank you, W. Let's take a call from Pompano, hello. And it'll, I think, Jim Carrey. Yeah. And I got a question for you. I've already Canadian. We don't talk Canadian stuff, okay. This is a software to show. This probably won't appall's boyfriend's. Ringer. Just fine. 560, 0.560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Horizon Marlesa. They wouldn't let most of you people in the Canada. All right. Maybe Quebec. I doubt it. Here's a call from a four-laterdale. Hello. New God. Yes, sir. You play him a lot, but didn't Larry have to be on your list. Then is Larry, excellent. But there's another guy. He's a young guy. And actually with the high school with him. He had a show on HBO called Mr. Show with Bob and Dave. It's named David Cross. If he hadn't been turned on to him, he is right up through alley. He's even got a little too far out there for me. But he's good. He's great. Okay. Let's get him on. Thanks a lot, Pally. Thank you. Keep it up. Have a great day. Not too long, Dennis. We don't have a Dennis Larry. It's a good one. Here's a fact. It said, now this isn't the guy again. It's facts twice on Monday. Yeah, it is. J.M. Oh, Jesus Christ Almighty. Look at how long this thing is. Man. On Monday, I sent you a fact concerning whether QM to return the broadcast. Right to the wrong games. You're nice enough to read him, but still feel the most likely. Next year's game. Yeah, I see. I hate to break the news, do you, sir? But the fact of the matter is that we had the broadcast rights for one or maybe two more years. Asked parents who wasn't sure, but at least one more season. So next year's games will not be on 940, even though it claims to be a loyal QM listener. Probably another one of Paul's boyfriend. What occurred yesterday during the parade is only up to validate my opinion. At 530, it was the book, Amber Broadcast. One couldn't help but hear other than the morning show duo from 103.5. I'm seeing the thing, a yati, a yati, a yati, where was QM? See, I hate to break the news to you. They've already got the contract. J.M. So I'm delighted that you're so concerned. You're so worried about the future of our relationship with the Florida Marlins. But we already have under contract. If Muff was doing his job, he'd come running in there right now and say, We got him under contract for two more scenes or whatever it is. If Muff was on top of things. Maybe he's important. He's eating a lot of eggs with parents right now. Then it goes down to say, it wouldn't be whoov the QM promotion department to kick all those clear channel folks and right in the nuts and put a real person out of who knows something about baseball for rail on that stage. The whole scene was to go, see, we didn't want to be associated with it too much. We don't want to be because most of our people speaking were sick, so for the big five six 705 60 pound five 60 in addition to which who wants to be, we already got me on the year, which is more than enough, you know what I'm saying? It's a sport. There's one. Too many people running around saying, we did it like that. That Harvey Firestein approached the baseball. We don't like that on QM. We like more manly kind of stuff. Five six seven. Five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Let me tell you about a fabulous place to take your feet. Probably good idea to take the rest of you two and that's Brandy Shoes and Pompeno Beach. They've been doing it right.

And lived in a flight signal as box. Now, master illusion is David Lane faces his greatest challenge ever. Come on, man. I got to get in there. Here's David Lane on the can. Cracked. Alone in the claustrophobic confines of the downstairs half bath near the laundry room. Dave, aren't really? Need to get in there, man. David Lane on the can. With only a glass of metamusyl, unearly empty roll of sharmun, and a five month old sportsy illustrated. Dave, come on, dude. The turtle is poking his head out. Don't miss the exciting conclusion of David Lane on the can. When David finally emerges from his fortress of the cometer. Oh, years, man. You know, come think of it. I don't have to go that bad too late. David Lane on the can. It might be a pile of don, but it's still better than all his other pointless stunts. George gives real nervous when the turtle starts poking its head out like that. 100 and some odd votes, which current comedian do you think is the funniest? 137. George Carlon 45. Here's a fact is how about Danny Carby, right? Is he on your yet? Yes. Go. Not on there. George Carlon 45. Chris Rock 41. Robin Williams 20. Mike Myers 10. Leslie Nelson 9. Jim Carrey 9. Max headroom John police three and Billy Crystal don't have any. Wow. Wow. They've turned on him. Remember what used to be to hot thing? Sure. That was 100 years ago though. That was only not 100. Not that for a pastor accused of a salt given two month paid leave. The pastor of a Houston's largest churches was given a two month paid leave of absence in the wake of allegations. He sexually assaulted the 37 year old man. Members who packed Brett Wood Baptist Church during a readily scheduled quarterly church business meeting Monday night approved a two month absence for Pastor Joe Samuel Ratley 53. There was overwhelming support for the pastor by the church said Paul Jefferson Business Administrator for the 12,000 member church. Ratley pretended the church meeting. He promised to come back stronger and even more committed to ministry than ever. Arnold Blake alleged in lawsuit filed on August that the pastor was sold in ratless office after a service honoring recruitment in February Blake sued both the church and ratley for an unsplosed amount of money. These suitors since been resolved parties for both sides said no terms disclosed. Campbell acknowledged that television broadcast of an audio tape with the pastor talking with Blake with improper language disturb members. Yoddy. Yoddy. Well there you go. Another one in good men of the cloth they have a temper too. Right. They're entitled to have a little tantrum now and in. Sure. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and we got them. And you know what those numbers yet? No, I haven't seen them. He's really slipping. He used to be on our side now. He's just turned on us to the entire radio station just in the run because it's not a sports thing like I said. Right. Margaret Joe. Margaret Joe. Sure. She's pot for some reason. She is. Yeah. Well Cynthia and Miami says put around here. No. Margaret Joe. Let's get Margaret Joe on a list. Kind of get some different names on there. Alright. Mm. Five to see if it was negative we get a bigger response. But there are still all whipped up about that parade yesterday. Aren't they? No. Now you're a tier. You got thousands of people lined up. Line up. Oh, how about Polka Brian? That's good. But he's not a comedian per se. He's like, yeah, what we call. He's a satrist. He's a satrist. Very good. He's a satrist who likes a good trist. How do you know? Jim says how about Polka Brian. What you got a good point Jim. Polka Brian is highly underappreciated. Not by us. But by some of the people out there radio and clean up one neurotic nutcase that calls us every now and all. Polka Brian sucks. She kind of disappeared that guy didn't he? Yeah, I think about it at Jiu's. Oh, if I got a great line for that. But I don't think I'll use it tomorrow. Deal emerging for $325 million. Marlon's stating in Miami Day. This is in the Wisconsin list morning. And of course, coming is no surprise to anyone. As thousands of Marlon fans tiered. Yes. When Miami City Commissioner Joe Sanchez and other got it with the name that ends in a Z, held up a sign at Bayfront Park meeting. If we build it when you come, they'd count the officials with developing what they hope will be the first piece of financing for new ballpark for the World Series champions. Los Campiones del Mundo. What I said, those compiones? Whatever. And they say right. Oppo, yamos. Oppo, yamos, Los Campiones. Del, you're as del, are. Del, are. On Tuesday night, ours after three Marlon victory parades, Dave County Mayor Alice Pinga Picania County manager George Burgess, several County commissioners in Marlon's president David Samson with a without Delilah said, I announced the county. We did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. Oh, calm down. Announced that the county intends to pledge $73 million, which had by a lot of textbooks, by the way, in combination of county hotel bed and sports of facilities taxes toward a 38,000 seat retractable roof stadium. And I'm going to say it again. 38,000 seats to me is ludicrous, but I'm, hey, I'm all for it because it's in Dave County. I'm not going to come out against it. I'm all for it. Not that I have any power anyway, but I'm just on you. Hey, have a good time. We got our big, soon to be white elephant or brown elephant or whatever you want to call it and Broward in the course you already got to Miami Arena sitting there empty as all crap. Any sports teams planted in Miami arena that I don't know about yet Scott? No, no. The funding pledges will come for a vote before County commissioners at their board meeting next Tuesday is contingent on the Marlon's contributing $137 million in covering any stadium cost overruns as long as the deal can be finalized by March for a teen. Not that they're putting a bonus rush on this, you do understand that. It's already like just about November and by March 15. The plan and business a $325 million ballpark somewhere in Miami. Officials set aside hasn't been determined. Somewhere, somehow somewhere. You know, maybe here, maybe over there, maybe down here to open in 2007. The construction figure does not include the land. Doesn't include the land. Even so, the County and team commitment that up to only 210 million and officials say they expect a final panel to include help from the city of Miami and the state. Obviously, that leaves a gap. Pinga Piccadio said, we don't have answers and how to fill that gap today. I'll be very honest. This is only the beginning of first step. Yeah, you'll be honest. That's the first time. County officials praised the Marlon's for making such a commitment, which is mainly a pledge of future stadium revenues and working to come up with the deal that's fair to the team and the community. Major League Baseball was happy too. Commissioner Budsceleg was ecstatic, which of course that should make an nervous right there. And there's the paragraph again that just makes me want to puke my guts out. But the plan which officials took pains to ensure was not being announced merely because of the euphoria surrounding the Marlon's championship was already ruffling some who wanted where the rest of the money will come from. And why Pinga Piccadio felt compelled of an ounce of yield before all the details, especially the thorny issue of the ballpark's location have even been worked out. That's what it is. Right. They weren't talking about it just because they were capitalizing strike and while the air was hot as the old saying go, no, they wouldn't do that would they. Yeah, you better sweet as they were. As again, they try to shove it down your throat and as always happens sooner or later. And Dave County, they finally buckle under and say yes, even when they have an election. They said they want to say yes because if they vote, no, it means yes, if they vote right. You know, like in the metro rail. I'm going to say it again for the eight minutes. I'm not that anybody there gives a flying crap because most of the people are already gone. They've already left or they're dead. But that metro rail vote was fixed. There is no question in my mind that that was a bogus vote. That thing was losing hands down your pants and all of a sudden when those late returns came in from home. Stay. What a definitely what a metro rail. Sure. Anywhere near there doesn't go within 20 miles of homes that all those votes come in from way away. We down the under and they said, yeah, let's have that metro rail. So we can get everybody down there to shorties for some good ribs and we can get for some barbecue. And we can get over to highly or nobody wants to go that other way. The industrial park. Right. Anyhow many people ride the metro rail this week? There you go. And they're still paying for it. Just like they're still paying for the freaking Miami arena. So why not have another stadium just have on every street corner. Other stadium and other arena. You know, every time I play that wing thing, I was saying this to you before the show this morning. All these spoiled rich sports owners. Well, I'm not going to play there anyway because you don't want to do what I want you to. Like a bunch of plexulate little children under their billions of dollars. Oh man. Well, you know, I'd like to take about 40 pounds of Kalman who are and just rub your ball spot with it for about an hour.

Because Paul's so low album's taste. And there's nothing in our piggy bank. That's why they're willing both of us on stage. Despite our age. To make the sounds of senior. We broke up in the 70's. And now we're nearly 70. Our old boy is no longer bland. And we are both wearing depends. And we want out the slightest idea of what we've played. You'll hear me gaze. To catch the sounds of seniors. It's still us who peace come back stage. But they all smell like vendingue. Most of them got in the show for free. Thanks to the discounts from ARP. And when we come back on stage to give you the encore. We're gonna snore. We did it! Because that's the sound of seniors. And though we didn't look at you. 11.32.5.60. WM and here's the schedule for today. We have no mad dog. What is this story with him? He never come back. I don't think so. He's on a schedule for tomorrow. Thank goodness. Because we got the big two to four today. They better not overdo that man. Oh, there's a good poll question. Who'd you rather hear filling in the big old Joseph Gackie? Or would you rather like bust your lady with a ball-peen hammer? I'm very angry. I'm very angry. I'm very angry. He's going to be filling the gap. Hank is back from a four to six three to seven known for a tough two and a half hours on it. He's back in the things I was going on. And then we got the six thirty to seven a panther preview.

It's really nice having Moll back. Absolutely. Isn't it? Yes, sure. Whatever. And so we can come on there and say, my new main man, David, the Samson, all those other crap. You're such a suck-old man. A real old, craggy suck-old. Have you heard of Dave Chappell? He's got a show on Comedy Central. You heard him? Dave Chappell? Yeah. He belongs on these up. Is he into a Sally Chappell? Sure. On that worst comedy comedian. Okay. Okay. I'm stuck about the radio. Okay. Here's another list. How about, well, let's not waste any time. Because I'm got a new notice. I just found a new poll. I don't like this poll. I'll talk about it. It's too positive. This audience said, no, that is this audience. So, for this, they don't cut into that too much. Remember Joseph Cotton? Uh-huh. How about Andrew Dice Clay? What do you say? I mean, he's like, kind of, pass-a, but put him on. Hey, he's doing those commercials. That's right. Something like he's about 400 years old. Mark Lucey Annie. Is he, is he kind of a Susan Kuchi Kuchi, Susan Lucey? Lucky Lucey Annie. I see. You know who that is? Susan Lucey? Oh, and David the Chappell, Chappell. No, no. Andrew Dice Clay's good enough. On a three-in-tat. Okay. Here's the second poll, which we'll put up around Nunes. Okay. No, we'll do the final result on this one, which nobody cares about. They don't care about good comedies. It's only like vent on our website every day. Baaaaa! Like that. Don't forget it. It is Wednesday. Scroans autobiographies out today. A lot of dirt about QAM over the last several years. How long has she been there? You think long time? About 30 minutes. Probably. She's done even a janitor in that place on bet. You think? She could probably draw your picture of what it looks like. Rick? At any rate, a screw-ins autobiography. One in the pink and one in the stink is available at better newsstands in your U-today and bookstores in a plain brown wrapper. You're like it. By three or four copies, some for the kids. Speaking of great books, seriously. Michael Moore, a dude wears my country. I'm going to read a little bit from that later on. I'm seriously thinking, although I'm not going to do it. Because then I get a Q. He's doing periodicals on audio again and the audience hated that. You know, everyone here is somebody reading on the ear. What's this? Everything. Yeah, that's true. But it certainly is a book that you people ought to be reading. Why did you just facts back to me my pool again? Oh, you know, all the time. Like that. I guess that turtle peeked at the shadow of the out of its shell again. That's not the arrow. Okay, so dirt gets really nervous and goosey when it happens. Here's the next pool we're going to do today. Oh, I see this is going to piss off those people who say yesterday. Hey, Neil, too much sports. But this isn't about sports. It's about scholars and common sense. It's about whether you've taken leave of your senses. It's about getting raped. It's about whether you're going to get the community wants to get raped at it again. Now, would they're close on? Who should pay for a new stadium for the Marlins? That's pool question number two going up at noon. Only the team owners, the suckers in Dade, only people who don't speak English, only the people who go to the games or no stadium, no way Jose. Five choices there. Do I leave anything out? Got it. Scott Sharp. Scott Sharp? Yeah, he'll pay for it. Okay. Yeah, let them play in the ODC. Answering the music for question. What does Don and his Scott Sharp? And of course, the answer to that. No, no. Who should pay for new stadium for the Marlins? Only the team owners, the suckers in Dade, only people who don't speak English, which they may be a little cross over there. Only the people who go to the games and no stadium, no way Jose. See this business of taxpayers having to subsidize something for a very small tiny, a segment of the community. That to me is absolutely unacceptable. No matter how much it is, especially in a community that's like the major city Miami, which is always an average of bankruptcy. Well, you got public schools with not textbook, where the roads are always like a piece of crap. They can ever find an, of course, the responses. Oh, but Neil, this is different money. This is the hotel tax and the bed tax. Yeah. And the thumb tax. And the excuse. Well, how about like, again, together since they do other, these other things behind closed doors and pasties resolutions and the finagle of the set of crap. How about past the resolution saying, oh, I guess what? We just decided to transfer that kind of money to pay for the budget deficits for all the other important stuff that's going on in our town as opposed to a bunch of crap. Man, and then this, I hate to say it, but this radio station is the epitome of what's wrong with South Florida, at least a part of it. Too much. That's right. Life is more than just. Paul games and hockey games and football games and basketball games and the college games and just. I'm on and on. There's got to be seven more than that. Cribbage. Yeah, that's right. I think I'm going to put the goddamn leaf game on here's metaphor. This is a pro. Oh, it's not on that. Are you interviewing a David Ellard for the 45th time? How are you doing, Dave? By the way, it's all over. Did you last a fucking last time? It was on the age. Which kind of I'm a guy? No, it's not. My. I'm not going to pull you. Okay.

But that's not all. Not all. Barry Mannellos can't snow without you. Is swollen with it? You nose and love. Like, I break the shnuzz. I made it through the pain. Looks like I broke it.

Barry Mannellos can't snow without you. It's walking to a Walmart. And pick up a copy, Tanya. Oh, damn well. I'm getting scoens book. I got a great pull for tomorrow, but I don't want to get that yet. What it is. Okay. Just have a great idea. Anyway, Rabbi's back is really guard pigs. From the BBC. An organization Israel has gained rabbinical approval of trained pigs to guard Jewish settlements in the West Bank. And by the way, some settlements are growing like crazy. You know what I said? I just mentioned it in passing. Until now Jewish settlements have been guarded by men with guns and also by guard dogs, but a new idea, guard pigs has been thrown up by an organization called the Hebrew Battalion. Oh, hey! The man in charge, Kuthe Ben Yakaov and Sisticez, a serious proposal, pigs sense his smell as far more developed than that of dogs he said. The pigs will also be able to identify weapons from huge distances and welcome to the direction of the terrorists there by pointing him out. Moreover, this animal is considered to be dangerous by Islam and according to the Muslim faith, the terrorist who touches a pig is not eligible for those 70 virgins in heaven. Well, a 30? Not even that. Only one or two, and that's like an alternate Mondays. See you got to have something with a real sense of nose because you got to know if it's like a real Palestinian or maybe like a Pakistani or maybe an Indian type of one. Under Jewish law, the pig is seen as an unclean animal. Almost a Ben Yakaov, Yakaov, has had a sea special approval from rabbis in order to begin training his hope for a legion of guard pigs. It's clear that in cases like this, the band that was imposed on raising pigs in light of Israel doesn't apply, sedangual shiloh of the Yesha rabbinical council. BBC Middle East correspondent James Reynolds says that some settlers had dismissed the idea, spares from this nonsense once settlers spokesman told the BBC that we'll never happen. That's what these spokesman said. It'll never happen. Peruvial pursuits, not just bathroom humor. Lawrenceville, Georgia. Few people enjoy bathroom humor as much as Mary Fraser long. In fact, the 71-year-old retired school teacher often gets phone calls from strangers, looking to share a few dirty jokes to their own. That's because long has spent almost 20 years collecting photos, stories, jokes, and interesting information about outhouses, which are fast becoming a thing of the past. She ought to head for Hallendale, you know what? Probably find Sunny Rosenberg prompting an at one right there on Hallendale Beach Boulevard. Enjoy that game. The first thing people tear down when they're moving up is the privy. By the 19, hot 90s, the refuel left in Guinnett County, she said, in 1984, long or husband Dean Published a book called Old Georgia privies, I don't even, I don't even heard that word. Did you? Of course. Are you privy to that information? Certainly. Old Georgia privies with photos of Georgian outhouses accompanied by pertinent poems and songs. When she retired a decade later, the Lawrenceville resident began lecturing around the state to civic clubs and church groups. She doughnuts, bees from her talk titled, Privial Persuits, and prophets from booksells to scholarship funds. She's also documented presidential privies, historic privies, ancient privies, and European privies. At a German castle, she learned that the outhouse opened out of a motel, making motel more dangerous than we ever thought she said. Long said she's learned more about outhouses than she ever wanted to know, offers this sage advice. Don't ever cite your privy under an apple tree because all those apples dropping on you will break your concentration. Oh, man, if you e-coupled me, I'll probably break a lot of wind too. Very gaseous. Here's a fact that, oh, look at this Miguel finally again with it. By the time you idiot, all of her, they must have worked him over. He was all red. You're in probably worked him over, man. If she wants to stop, Pana, why does he file a sex discrimination suit against that nasty bitch? That way she did pity Lenny, I still can't believe that. I'm trying to envision it. Talk about out wouldn't old oak tree. He's like a red wood tree, you know? Just reasoning? Like a lobster. Like like the red lobster. See him get his claws on Dorine the Queen. Lobster claws. 36,535. That's enough to better make some progress. A nice van hit for our best in the Elmerch and Nice for a van at Perrescu will be 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Ding and Vett Solutions. Ding, do you know what? Think about them. Look at them.

So we'll only take three dogs this year. Yeah and where's the checks from all my good. Can pay for this there in the building. Oh, you see your laugh and I don't find it amusing at all. What are you going to do? Because we got some people there. We got for a round making some big bucks. Where's his check? We are more you even more. Not that he's going to give us any more cash but. At least he already made his contribution. That's right. He made his contribution. Just and it's felt like crap. All the crap you could unwrap. Okay, come down. But we got the more Howard David Keychain. So he's done his part. Scott for well nothing. Mad dog nothing. The hump or nothing which really shocks the lot of me. Eddie came up and so far was every year. Eddie K. was just a great guy. Has always have to stop nothing. Joe and Mark. They can afford a bit. Joe's parents coughed up and I check right. Right.

How about Troy Stratford with Steve Law commission on my account. Oh, nothing. How about the way it should give us a piece of that. You've advanced. She got from the book. Oh, she gives everybody also piece and that advance fake police used in Bush visit. Public servants were deliberately dressed up as police officers. The bolster numbers during the visit to Canberra president George W. Bush has been revealed. Ha ha ha. As F.A. 18 Hornets and helicopters buzzed overhead, bureaucrat switch rolls to be part of the nation's biggest security blints armed with nothing more than pans and water bottles. In a major embarrassment for authorities it's been revealed almost one and nine of the police decided to protect the world's most powerful man last week. Actually was a civilian. They were deployed various places including the launch US embassy and parliament house. The acts acting deputy chief police officer commander Mandy Newton yesterday admitted 46 unswore members the Australian federal police were on duty during the 21 hour visit. That's okay.

Now, back when I was a kid about 100 years ago in Rochester, we had places called Don and Bob's and Vick and Rers and there was the other one. Nick Tahoe's places like that. Everybody loved them because everything was fresh and delicious and they had all kinds of special ingredients that they used in them. Vick and Rers has been around since way back in 1934 and the one in South Florida now who could news for you is right on federal highway. South of Bard, Boulevard and the tunnel on the east side. Vick and Rers is a flashback in time to what great restaurants used to be before is these prefabricated fast food joints. Go and enjoy a burger hot dog served hot fresh and fast and a good news for is that Vick and Rers in South Florida is being brought to you by the same folks who bring you another place you love cheaper for cheaper and they use the same fresh 100% ground chuck meat as cheaper for cheaper. They are for an incredible big quarter pound hot dog which I guarantee for many of you will be the biggest piece of meat you ever put in your mouth for some. Well, makes Vick and Rers different from anybody else is that all their burgers and dogs are served with Vick's signature meat sauce poured on top giving you an amazing combination of flavors in your mouth. It will be doing like a little dance, a horror in your post. If you want something else try the great breakfast menu. I'm Let's Cook the Order French toast pancakes, all your favorite side dishes. If you want a really great fresh meal, this is the place Vick and Rers and understand why it was so popular in Rochester and everywhere else too.

He said it should be going to the convention center So what they're gonna do is rob Peter to pay Paul The city of Miami and states rules have yet to be defined although with thought that Miami will be responsible for securing the land Among locations being considered the old Miami or winner. Oh that's a good one that'd be a great location 30,000 people won't But land needed around the site could be your costly to acquire.

Oh, that's right That's what they want And not just the date county taxpayers Because we're talking about state funds Involving the face You see how grotesque this is This is the same governor He says he's got devious plans And I realize we're only talking about a few million here And a few million there But we can't, you know, even though the public already voted on the class Assize amendment We can't do that because it's got to cost us a lot of money So we don't have money for education Or for anything to do with the state of Florida Because we don't have any lobby for young people for kids All we have is the grey, whatever it is Other grey panters, all the old parts Which is why they're still driving around and getting their licenses We knew in the mail for six years Even if they're deaf dumb and blind, it all will be above Because Florida is owned by a bunch of crooks And old parts, the dead people run the state And a bunch of religious Bible-tumping y'all Which is why you got no casino either Which is why it's dead as a freaking door nail Which is why yesterday was such like an aberration Hey, it's wonderful. Here's something exciting going on I was going to say here's something exciting going on That isn't just another ethnic festival But At least that till after 430 Who should pay for the state and put them are? Let's get that on there, Eric and I apologize I never leave you alone for the rest of the day We're just like working him too hard, you know Well, well, what? It's good for him That's right. Little extra time. I can't hear it. Little elbow grease.

I'll be providing jobs Right, and the food is going to be delicious And what's not to lie? We'll have a pretty facade on the front of the world Right, it's going to be a spruce up the hood What the hell is not to lie? Free parking? No, sorry. Here's the call for my email Hey Neil, what's up? Yes sir I just figured how they're going to do it And it's so smart me if I'm not a funny Neil Yeah What they're going to do the only reason they need a vote is Bond, issue or raising taxes They're going to find the service that they know The voters would approve a bond issue for Take money out of that, build the stadium Then when they don't have enough money for that service They're going to go to the public and say, hey, we need a bond This year to get kids schoolbooks Now they're never going to get that thing They don't care about whether they have kids schoolbooks Don't you understand nobody cares about that in the economy No, but for an example, they'll just use something as an excuse Saying, hey, we don't have the money for this service We need to vote on a bond issue And of course everybody is going to say yes to give the cops more money Or football cops on the street Any one who's that money to build a stadium Let's say they're going to rob Peter to pay for it Slow on the marginal unit This is going to be an inner Feynman I'll put it in the ärst bull That was good, I like it We should have put that on tape. Instead of a mirror pinker per game He's laughing now He's laughing now, but probably gonna be crying and come 2007 when he sees his tax bill. 560, 560, pound 560 on the end. I say let's just get all of millionaires and billionaires and bill them all whatever they want. A stadium and arena and outhouse, what whatever they like. Come on. See Mercon, I've been way, let's go. Don't be asking any questions. Now it's just like all this business in Iraq. Don't be by 80's in video here. Don't be worried about this stuff. It's worth it. Don't worry about the fact that the guy they've infrastructures going to hell in a hand basket. In the fact that there really isn't any guy they have online security. Don't be concerned about these things. Don't be concerned that we haven't found Osama, Yamamo, or Mullah, or any of these people are certainly not Sodom and Gamora. Although it was, it is comforting to know that at least David Sampton did find Delilah. And that great. Oh my god, Harvey Firestein lives. 567 over Don't let me forget my Michael Morstaff. Don't. I'm saving him. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Hey, hello. Yes, Sarah. Hello. Hey, why do you care if they're full of stadiums? I don't. Here's a call from a four-laterdale. Hello. That's the same guy. Why do you care? Always starts with the same crap. Four-laterdale. Hello. Deadmail. Yes, sir. Is there legitimate reason for doing the stadium economics, the structures, I'm safe. I've been there. It looks pretty good to me. You know, it's a interfering with football. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, that's not the problem that all of the owners have had. At least the other two owners John Henry and these people. The problem is that Wayne has got the, he owns the stadium and they get, they don't get a dime from concessions or from the a sweet. So anybody who owns the team can't make any money going in there, but of course they knew that going in. See, this is something anybody who buys the team. Every new they had that deal with Wayne going in. So in some other words, if you buy an establishment and any kind of a retail business for example, and you know that because of the concession, because of whatever the deal is, you can't possibly make a profit no matter what happens, then what it is, that means you made a bad deal. Okay, I appreciate the straight answer, man. Okay, you bad. The straight answer for me, not so straight guy. Well, that's just the way it is. That's the way it is. They can't make it profit in P.P. Park. Never going to happen under any circumstances. And you know what? Too bad. So the question boils down to this. And of course all of this no matter the lies from these and the fact that the people in the Sun sent, and I actually put that in there would a straight post, come on. If I don't think they were probably holding their nose when they wrote it. About the timing, they want to make sure that the public doesn't take the timing at anything and do with capitalizing on the euphoria and all these parades and all these things on. Right, we all believe that. Your paranoid. I mean, come on. Where does that? What I do with that story? Here it is. The plan which officials took pains to ensure was not being announced merely because of the euphoric surrounding the Marlins championship. Right. And I got 75,000 acres of phenomenal land in the Everglades that also do you for like a dollar a dollar? How do you like that? Kind of bullcraft man. When are you people going to finally wake up and sniff the daffodils and like that asshole to when I always just why do you care about this? Well, I'll tell you why I care because I'm sick and damn tired of watching the rape of the public there. But from a personal standpoint, I don't give a crap. If the public in date County is that stupid that they want to go and vote for it. If it comes on a referendum or they want to sit back and do nothing and be raped into the again. Fine. Maybe they like the way it feels. Okay. Maybe it tickles their euvealut. They stick it in there deep enough. Right. 26 past noon at 5.60. All I don't know how I can do that that tingo pecania.

Okay, I'm just calling to tell you, I am a gangs building them as stadium. A baseball I love the Marlin, they wanna stadium, they can build with themselves. And as far as keeping the team together, Pugett kind of moving into his mid-life for a catcher. He stayed a couple more years and he won't be worth jack. I mean maybe we oughta send a punch pack and just call me a pack. Yeah. Bye, baby. Okay. Have you been punched back in? Yeah. All right. And of course, we'll then ask that size. Well, 136 votes, who should pay for New State and for the Marlins, only the team owner is 59. No stadium, no way Jose, 27. The suckers in day 25, you see that first one there, how can you argue with that? Now, there was if they want to come up with a cash or work out some kind of a deal, see, the reason that they can't make any money from the sweets in the PB park is that all of revenue from there has got to go to a ping off the debt on the service on the debt from when Joe Robby built the stadium. Right. So that's forget about that. Anyway, only the team owner 62, no stadium, no way Jose, 27. The suckers in day 25, how do you like that? Oh, could I leave it? Only people who don't speak English, 21. Only the people who go to the games for and the taxpayers did go on here now. It's got three votes so far. All right. Michael Moore, dude, where's my country of book that everyone should be forced to read? Hey, don't forget. Oh, okay. Should I read some of our couple of pages? Well, I don't care if anybody don't like my reading because I like it. Me too. He's got one part in here where he's comparing all the lies that the public is totally compares to like Burger King, a Wap or combo with extra lettuce. Each a Wap or hold a Mayo, etc. Number nine, double wap or which he's in a coke, the American media's brought you to the truth about Iraq. If you're going to sell a mess of wapers, you need a good advertising campaign. Corporations pay a big money for that kind of marketing. But the Bush administration didn't have to spend a dime on these supposedly liberal media join forces with the old and the White House field office at Fox News to create a well-world pro war propaganda offensive that was almost impossible to avoid. And it worked. Even vegetarians were gathering down those wapers, accompanied by rather clock patriotic march-to-war music and flag inspired graphics on these so-called scooses for news channels, the images were relentless. Tearful farewells from proud families as brave soldiers headed overseas, heroic American girls rescued by daring American guys, smart bombs doing their brilliantly destructive work, grateful Iraqis topping the Sodom statue, a united America standing by our resulute and German leader. Then it was the footage being directly to us from the Harshurmaki desert where reporters embedded with the ground troops were given greatly way to report without interference from the Pentagon as we were supposed to believe. The result, lots of close-up and personal stories about the hardships and dangers faced by our military and virtually nothing examining why we had sent these fine young people in the harm's way. And there was even less said about what was happening to the people of Iraq. So, unless you ignored US news entirely and only watched the BBC or CBC or the journal from France, with its convenient English subtitles for an American audience too lazy and poorly educated to alert another language, you could pretty quickly find yourself believing that all this sacrifice was for a valid cause. And just what exactly was the reason for the war with Iraq? We were so thoroughly waterized that pulls showed that half of all Americans wrongly thought that Iraqis were on the September 11 planes and a one-point nearly half believed that the US had found weapons to match destruction in Iraq when no such discovery had been made. One quarter of those surveyed thought that Sodom had at least the chemical or biological attack against coalition forces which also never happened. The widespread misconceptions were understandable. It was almost impossible to hear the perspective of anyone who questioned or opposed the Bush administration's rationale for rushing to war on American television. The media watched a group fair studied the evening newscast of 6 US TV networks and news channels for three weeks, starting on March 20, 2003, the day after the US bombing of Iraq began. The study examined the affiliations and views of more than 1600 sources who appeared on camera in stories about Iraq. The results were hardly a surprise. Fewers were 25 times more likely to see a pro-war US source than someone with an anti-war point of view. Military sources were featured twice as frequently as civilians. Only 4% of sources appearing during the three weeks were affiliated with universities think tanks or non-governmental organizations. A total of 840 US sources who were current former government or military officials only for identified as opposing the war. The few appearances by people with anti-war view points were consistent limited to one sentence sound by it's usually from unidentified participants in on-the-sweet interviews. Now the single one of these 6 telecast study conducted they sit down and be with anyone who opposed the war. In some cases journalists freely confessed to a startling lack of objectivity. The fair study quoted CBS News anchor Dan Radder during an appearance with Larry King on CNN. Look, I'm an American. I never tried to kid anybody that on some international is to do something. It will my country as a war I want my country to win whatever the definition of win may be. Now I can't and don't argue that that is coverage without a prejudice about that on prejudice. During the three weeks study period fair found that only one anti-war sound by it on rather CBS evening news appeared. It was made by me if the academy wards his Michael Moore talking about the fictitious war wage of our fictitious president. Over at Fox News, Neil Cavoto had this to say on air in response to a critic, there's nothing wrong with taking sides here. You see no difference between a government that oppresses people and one that does not, but I do. MSNBC demonstrated its patriotism with America's bravest. A billboard of photographs of military personnel fighting in the war sent for display by their friends and families. And Brian Williams of MBC and MSNBC said this about the killing of Iraqi civilians. Civilians used to be intentional military targets. The fire bombings of resident and Tokyo and WWE 2 were meant to kill civilians and then terrorized survivors here we've seen the opposite happen. The army recently signed a $470 million contract with Microsoft which is co-owner of MSNBC along with NBC, NBC is internal by general electric, one of the nation's largest defense contractors. GE's military aircraft engine contracts run in the billions, but the first study found that NBC actually featured more disinnived points about the war, a whopping 1% more than any other US network. And can I read one more page? Could you please? Yes. Later on in the book he says, it might be good he's got a list of reasons here what we ought to be doing how to stop terrorism and he says stopping terrorists. Number six it might be good to find out why hundreds of millions of people on three continents stretching from Morocco on the Atlantic to the Philippines and the Pacific are so pissed off about Israel. Now I'm not just talking about your every day run with a militarized semites you can find them on all seven continents including Antarctica. Now I'm talking about a perceived notion that we Americans are supporting Israel and oppression of the Palestinian people. Now where did those Arabs come up with an idea like that? Maybe it was when the Palestinian child look up in the Ernsan American Apache helicopter, firing a missile into his baby sister's bedroom just before she was blown into a hundred bits, touchy touchy. Some people get upset over the piqueous things. Is that any reason to dance in the streets when the world trades center falls to the ground? Of course many Israeli children have died to at the hands of the Palestinians. You would think they would make every Israeli want to wipe out the Arab world but the average is really doesn't have their response. Why? Because in their hearts they know they're wrong. They know that they would be doing just what the Palestinians are doing if the sandal were on the other foot. Hey here's the way to stop the suicide bombings give the Palestinians a bunch of missile firing Apache helicopters and let them in the Israelis go with each other head to head. $4 billion a year to Israel, $4 billion a year to the Palestinians they can just blow each other up and leave the rest of us to hell alone. How do you like that? It's Michael Moore. That's my man for president right there. Michael Moore has got the balls to tell all like it is and of course the media's got to, oh gee can you believe he said that and can you believe we've got the balls to be saying this? And all of these things. I'm going to watch your bowling for Kanabana again just as a refresher court. My life and law. Vixie kept saying going to the chapel, Elvis saying you saw me crying in the chapel. Hey Glenn get a life sweetheart. How do you like that? Talk about those pickers and nitpickers. My apologies.

Plus it gives us a chance to take so many more of these stellar calls today. Nobody QAM hello. I deal. Yes sir. Yeah I was thinking one of the best people who could put up the stadium about the Catholic Church. The reason being first of all to be taxed deductible they got certainly got the money. Jack McEangles is church all the time. The guys are always crossing themselves. That's a good point that's excellent. And when the marlins aren't playing they can hold heroes and masses and whatever else they do. And the chief usher could be tested in molester. Okay. I said the idea pal. I think I did say the Vatican. Did I say it before? Yeah. Right. 560 with some of those tax-free dollars. Those billions and billions of course a lot of them tax-free dollars are disappearing because they have to keep in off all the lawsuits from all them poor abuse of their children. 560-70560 pound 560. I mean you know we can talk and have a good time but it's not going to change anything. They're going to jam it through. They're going to shove it right down your throat whether you want it or not. Who should pay for a new stadium for the marlins? 176 votes only the team older Z80. No stadium. No way who's a 35. The suckers in day 28. Only people who don't speak English 23. The taxpayer is 6 already. And only the people who go to the games for. Now let's see 6 already voted for the taxpayers. One of them must have been Mayor Pinguapakanyu right? Oh I'm sure. One of them had to be. We won the World Series. Silly David Samson. One of them was Jeffrey Luria so that's three. One was probably Moe because he suck in both their assulate. Lisa that's four. Who else? Probably Michael Mayo 5 because he's in Broward anyway. Do we know anybody else? I might have voted number 6. The QL staff. Somebody on the stamp. Probably Dave Van Boring because he still wants to get you know. He shouldn't get a job any place else. No chance. No way Jose Dave Van Boring. And embarrassing job. They humiliating the grading job for a World Champion team. Los Capione's Del Mundo. Shame on you. Shame on us for putting you one a year. Shame on a Marlin. I don't think we hired you now. So do we know? Now. No we don't. That's a team thing. The team hire is their own individual. And I was just like just like the dolphins with you know who. Absolutely. Here's West Palm Beach. Hello. Hey how you doing? Pretty good to meet you. I hate to be a bat boy in that Catholic stadium. You know that would be one horrible thing. The other thing I want to thank George for looking me up with my bed and I wanted to give you a recommendation and bring a little fact to you. 29 days of movie. You all need to see it as a great flick. It's a great horse and French flick and I think you would get a trip out of it. It's a British. Okay. But the fact I wanted to bring in was you know you're talking about school books and the fact is that state the state allocates those dollars to the school district. The city has nothing to do with that. The problem is the state because we stopped using tablets way back when and the Holy Bible in schools you know have to just never give enough enough money to get enough books out there for kids you know. And they got to read anyway. So why you give a book to a kid that can't read? He got that point. Good point. Salah. Don't you? Yeah. Here's a fan who sends me a thing. See I read the whole book. Now he's they're probably talking about the look at page 270. It's going to be really good trick to look at page 270 because there's only 249 pages in the book. Well wait. What's in filler music? It's just before Neil gets too carried away with Michael Moore's book. Tell him to take a painkillate page 270. He will smit big time. I think what he has to say is great but I draw the line with this very probably what they're referring to is where he talks about Oprah for President which is not on page 270 because the book's only got 249 pages. I heard him say that on subidivier. Yeah. Oprah. That could be just a little bit. A little tongue and cheek. Yeah. And I'll take it too even though I hate the bitch like poison at least you know she's got a shot. We got a shot like Jimmy Johnson said. So I don't know what page 270 you're talking about big fan but see this is the day for everybody to correct me. I make a lot of mistakes like sitting down here at five or ten. You know where in boxes are you? Yes, I am. I'll see. Should be where in briefs. No. 560 560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. We got the big. Oh come on up at the two to four this afternoon. We want the mad dog back soon you know. Oh right. Jesus Christ. And he learned from me every time I'm there he always comes in and shakes my hands his is I want to thank you you're my mentor you to want to talk me less work and more pay. I want to give you a kiss. I'm a cheek only please. The hump are at four to six thirty a two and a half hour a grueling experience for hang today. Six thirty it's your pants and preview. Panters at the flyers the uh at Tilly seven o'clock any cap that a game join mark to the five over night. And then the moment of the booties back in the morning with guilty little suck hold guiltys and ah gee let's build it down by the mania arena. Let's say that this was on Monday he was already had a stadium built before all the parades and hoopla yesterday. He was already just jumping on board sucking the heavy duty. Here's a lady in candle hello I'm on a wrong line. I'm sure here's for a lot of day hello hello hello Neil. Yes sir. Hey I've been listening to you for the past couple of days. Actually I listened to you all the time but I noticed the last couple of days you and and a good number of your colors of all expressed their opinion concerning any public participation in the financing of this new ballpark. Yes sir. And one of the reasons people keep using for opposing it I keep appearing over and over and over about how our school kids and then they'll have enough classroom space and they don't have enough textbooks and I think that a lot of people that bring those concerns up are certainly well-intentioned but my god could anybody be more misinformed. I mean in the real world does anybody believe that the reason our kids don't have textbooks and overcrowded classrooms have anything whatsoever to do with the rena's and baseball stadiums. Yes. That's ridiculous. No it's not ridiculous you know something when you're talking about taxpayer dollars it doesn't make any difference where they come from their own X number of dollars so just like the last call it's giving me like you know a song and dance about whether they come from the state or whatever how they're funded it doesn't make any difference it's still has number of tax dollars. Well question of priorities. The date county school board has a yearly budget of 4.6 billion dollars. Yeah. Every decision. Okay and they still can't get it right. The reason our kids are an overcrowded classrooms is because of the way they misallocate the money they already have not because there's a lack of money. Yeah. Yeah. And and that's it I mean there's a lot of good news. All right so let's take that out of the mixes they say okay let's take education out there we got more than enough money they're just misappropriating the fun. Right about all of the other things the services that we have. Such as such as the road such as the infrastructure such as the Zinnian other things that are going on in South Florida. I want you to go to the stadium right now and write a check okay I want you to be the first one online or write a check I'm not going to say you're a waste my time arguing with you because you're trying to defend the priorities of a bunch of assholes overgrown self as children like I've always said before the people are selfish and that included me with a hockey thing I admit to it though I'm I'm like you I admit it we needed that them or we needed a hole in the head so that Wayne could make more goddamn money and then sell the damn team and like you know make millions more on that please fleece the public and fleece the unsuspecting new people we could feel four hours talking about the things more important yeah oh my god roads and this and that yeah how man you know something my answer to your question is anything else right anything else we've already got more goddamn stadiums in arenas they even shake a stick at all right think of how many citrus trees you could be ready can in a meantime nobody's at the Mickey Eris in AAA arena and the people of our there are busy schmooz and a walk around a guy in hallways in cipenter cocktails nobody's at the macaroon for the sporting events there and ones of our their likes scots is walking around on the hallway cipenter guy they're mosoes in fill in their fat face and sitting on their cell phones talk of their friends across the way haven't got the least amount of interest and their and and the fact that the matter with the counties and benefiting one dime from any of that and a marlins we don't even have to rehash the history of the marlins okay all of the stuff you saw yesterday was as phone is a twenty seven dollar bill fun yes positive yeah if you want something to grab on do but would they have anything to do with the reality is self-floor no it's not a baseball town that's never gonna be you could build a goddamn stadium in every street corner it's still not gonna be it's a one-pointy town man it's a football town per cones that they're playing like anyway except one of their girl steams they can pack that place in because half of the fans are rooting for the other team anyway and the dolphins they'll come close to pack in a place although you know sometimes they have a tough time doing it how many years ago was it this god when they had that came against the cult that had to be blacked out oh decades yeah and I wasn't that long ago no just a few years ago because I'm a head of invited fat rich to come by watching my house because I was watching it off the a big dish 98 so that's five years ago couldn't sell out a playoff game at pp park for the football team and this is supposed to be a football town so sir please don't give me this lecture the song of the answer about how well intention but misinformed we are take the money and help me the god damn homeless do something with anything that's productive give it to a band and pet rescue use it for anything constructive use it for law enforcement use it for getting all the scumbags off the streets whatever you want use it to god damn round up all the what's his name Sean Cononis crowd and put them in the house got man yeah instead of giving me a song to dance how we have to continue entertaining all these millionaires and billionaires by couchoing to them and finding some kind of very clever device and there is still pain for the freaking Miami arena for crying out loud we're still paying for that white elephant they haven't figured out what they'll do with it and then Mickey Eros and you know makes a nice sweet deal with the mayor of pingo which I guess everybody must have Alzheimer's and Dave County because one of the most important things he promised back when he got elected the first time is he would never ever make a deal with that billionaire SOB and let him put a statement there and the first thing that he did was go behind everybody's back and made that deal well Mickey's paying for their arena yeah but how about all the other costs that it's going to talk cost the taxpayers the next 500 years shot yeah right and arena that nobody wants that nobody needed let's have every not just every county habits owner renown stadium let's not have a neighborhood have a zone county we can have the opalaka stadium and the mirror market stadium and the plantation stadium and a god dim what else sweet water stadium and all those stadium because that's way down the gold stadium the pompot obit stadium in arena then all we got to do is find a bunch of teams that have to put in or of course nobody's gonna go how the strikers doing or what though was the last one over the last time was the last incarnation of the strikers huge shot the what fusion the now that's it the fusion how the confusion how are they doing anybody see them lately oh no how about that minor league hockey team that came in a time remember when we first came to QM and they wanted me to be the patchy did try to put over minor league hockey and so forth I said you people got to be smitten me was that the Miami manatees that was very good the mind is that's where the playing now in the arena what they're playing in the old arena playing in the old arena yeah Miami arena now you're not talking about the same thing I'm talking about the enterprise that we're talking about they lasted for about three months and he went out of business oh well the Miami manatees now are playing in the Miami arena and then we had the or maybe I'm talking about was it the roller hockey thing that was what it was well we've had so many of man you can't even keep track no more but hey let's just keep digging out of the taxpayers pockets in an area where the overwhelming majority of people don't care about these things anyway if you want taxpayers to pay their money may let them pay for something that maybe they might use that maybe they might benefit them someday somehow but thank you so much for your education to under 12 votes who should pay for the new stadium for the marlins only the team owners 98 no stadium no way Jose 39 the suckers in day 31 only people who aren't speaking wish 27 the taxpayers 10 I think they've had Samson voted more than once and only the people who go to the games what a concept eight we now it's got the round when I'm up in Boca take a slap in all the women with paint and lips around the fall I listen to the new Rogers one to two I mean I listen to the new Rogers iron balance one to two hours when we get more on like Mitch you call up and they say stupid things that they don't have any bases on because somebody on this radio station who's on between nine and one decides to poison everybody because for him it's a bit and the idiots that listen to them they actually buy in that is pretty dumb to buy in well they buy in because they're idiots you know why they because their brains are soft like marshmallows and they can be twisted and turned any which way you want they go great with more as though that's exactly right you're on a roll today I like it so the brains are soft and they say stupid things because they don't have enough intelligence to come up with an original thought of their own so they listen to people that can manipulate them to make them say make them think whatever they want the only thing missing is the cool aid thank you Jim who's on today who's doing the show today Jorge that's George George Rodriguez you know I just come back or see done next year no is he really damn that's got a deal oh I say it's in you know while people say you know well you're knocking the oil it's not not this is what you know what it is it shows you how effective the guy is that he can manipulate the stupidity that listens between nine and one he you might agree with probably and he's laughing his ass off all the way to the bank he's absolutely letting you know what he is he's laughing at you Mitch because you're a M oh R oh N I'll spell it out for you and now I'll tell you what I just said it means moron because he's fell there's an old saying this is boom the rocks shame on you can't get pulled again last time we were in Iraq I guess we failed seams the more we snook the less we found I'd know the nuclear capabilities disappointing our inspection teams because we got a face that he's a deceiver that won't be a trace if we go back this time we're out of luck the season to see if there won't be a damn thing well that's a fine he thinks we are more or less idiots thinking it can hide the stuff he's got what's the use of searching what do we got to gain don't you know you can't try side down the same because we got our face that he's a deceiver that won't be a trace if we go back this time we'll have a look if season to see the the won't be a damn thing well that's a fine and you share them on this side there you know I'm solo i'm solo Oh, it's a monster! Oh, it's a secret! No way! It's a secret! It's a secret! That's what they think! Oh, if you wanna make lots of money, well, it's a swear. I like to make lots of money, that's for sure. Fuck it, be it hell, a special, be it a secret! Is big a fella? It's a good one. If we don't get more than a psycho, I'm something that's slow. I don't know, I love my Harley. Cut off! Tell people you don't like my show, we much love man, and you like that man, because clearly he never saw. Oh, I don't beat up that man, that's the source. They don't rush, he has a friend, so a friend. Oh, it's him to be. It's him to be. Hey! Oh! I'm pretty old. That's why my head hangs down, loose and drool. I see my toes, protruding from my gau, in my booty. Or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my heart, or my eyes. I smell my arm, as I dip in, my dress like I'm snoozing. My bones are gone, that funny had on my head, in these three rooms. Or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my eyes. I feel so good. As I look down, things I start where to explain, I am fine, dude. So butter high-power, six dollars in, loose change, and my guard keys. Or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my eyes. Or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, or my head, one-on-one is five, sixty-one of the QMU know, I rarely read the introductions to books for some reason. Yeah. But if you do get the Michael Moore book, do it with my country, you gotta read the impression, because one of the most amazing parts is where he talks about how Harper Collins, tried to destroy his career, because right after 9-11, when a book was posted, they tried they prevented it from being released, and they demanded that he re-write up to 50% of it, because it was critical of Mr. Bush. And he said, no, thank you. And of course Harper Collins is a division of newscorp, which owns Fox News, and it's all owned by Rupert Murdoch. Just to coincide in, of course, okay. Who should pay for new stadium for tomorrowins, we asked on thearages.com, 243 votes so far, not looking too promising. Only the team owners are 115. No stadium, no way Jose 43.

Then he said something that left me in awe. Hillary, I have a picture of you in my office. Mmm, delicious! Almost immediately, we crashed into bed. It was wonderful to lose myself and sheer physical sensation. A few days later, Stevie Wonder called and asked if he could come over to see me at the White House. I answered, yes, you must come to see me. That night, I was ushered upstairs until the put on a wig and hoop skirt. And he periodically broke into giggles for no apparent reason. I'm not all that athletic anymore. But the next thing I knew I was swinging back and forth, squealing. When Stevie finished, I felt numb. Another surprise soon followed. Palma Cartney, George Harrison and Mick Jagger. He'll didn't mind. After all, he happens. Now, from red, go records. Satan's bebecing Billy Joel. Go ahead, please range me.

It used to be that cable was a whole lot worse. But now the networks let their actors curse. There's the wind and sights of this have sailed of tea. All the dialogue and take profal of tea. Swear in like a sailor on a pre-day pass. Words are whole on words that ask. If one has come, one will have been. Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word. Out of all of the English words that begin with a letter half. Because the only word that is referred to as the F word. It's the one magical word. Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. As most words in the English language is derived from German, the word fliechen which means to strike. In English, f*** falls into many grammatical categories. As a transit of verb, for instance, John f*** surely. Its meaning is not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective such as John's doing all the f***ing work. As part of an adverb, surely talks to f***ing much. As an adverb, enhancing an adjective, surely is f***ing beautiful. As a noun, I don't give a f***. As part of a word, it's absolutely f***ing lovely or inf***ing credible. And, as almost every word in a sentence, f***ing f***ing f***ing. As you must realize, there aren't too many words with the versatility of f***ing. As in these examples describing situations such as fraud, I got f***ing the used carolot. This may, off f***ing. Trouble, I guess I'm really f***ing now. Aggression, don't f***ing with me, buddy. This missile, why don't you go outside and play hide and go f***ing yourself? I'm sure you can think of many more examples. Say it loudly and proudly. F*** you! I got to get out of this game. If it's the last thing I ever do, I got to get out of this gig. I used to be a star. I'm talking TV and movies. DJ Hooker, emergency 911. You like Star Trek, right? Scotty, be me up from this nightmare gig. I'll admit it. I got the call for my age at about this priceline.com thing. When things weren't going too well, no way. Things weren't going at all. So he says, Bill, you want to do a few commercials. I'll play with 10 of them money. So I said, sure, it wants to well. They said, hey Bill, you want to do it on TV? And I said, what do I sign? I'm back on TV, baby. I'm going to be a star again. I'll be big. Really big. And then I realized on the TV sponsor, making fun of that really awful album. I made back in the 60s. I'm a parody of myself. Wow, wow. But my agent says, I already signed the contract. You're stuck. He says, I got to get out of this gig. Girl, I'm a better life than I do. Thank you. Thank you. No problem. 1,375,60, WDQM, 224 votes on I'd pull. Who should pay for a new state in front of Marlins?
