Carry a ok well He's an erotic guy Because he's worked for a great read I don't know for a long time It's just like when we first came to the station Remember I was talking to the day about a Hank Is different now because I meld him out Yeah But when we first came there Hank was like a Raving lunatic and he was just brow beating Everybody just a tankerist I mean more so than ever Can't hankerist Hank tankerist He was hankerist He still got a little on the tanky side But at any rate And then I kind of like brought him back to earth A little bit bitched him out of the middle And the same with muff When I was just saying about muffy Far out of the Hank What a good singer he is Now I was saying about how neurotic he is Oh, I was sick and in the acting Was he neurotic first before he worked for Greg Or did Greg make him into the basketball case that he is today That's obviously obvious question Because he's a great voice Yeah And keep in mind that was Tommy engineered that thing And it sounded pretty good You know the karaoke deal But can you imagine like in a real recording studio Right I mean they can make a singer out of just about anybody When you come right down But I've heard stuff sing live and let me tell you Yeah, but that's what I'm saying I wasn't knocking him I was just saying But so with a little added accutrement There in a real studio he could do sound great He could be he's he's wasted his time You know, if you're going around under the radar at the QAM By the way Jim Sarny you were an asshole I can't waste any time because of guilty Took a career this morning Let's see women are all bitches And what's the other thing we're supposed to say And then screw you If you We all want to be outrageous and the rip women are QAM You know you're such an asshole I guess if I was just ugly as you sarny I'm not I'm ugly but not even in your league Man, probably the mirror and saw that every day I'd probably be unleashing out too You know what she's doing It's stupid as calm and speaking of the Suncentland stupid people Tom Jick is going to be up for ready K tonight 1039 Maybe you want to call Tom ask him a why there's no article on the radio ratings again As usual Since he isn't town now Maybe how come neither one of the newspapers Including the one that he works on It's come central decided that it was a major story That Broward County Commission passed that resolution About the Patriot Act all of these things You know And about how 99% of what he writes about is about network TV shows And nothing about the local scene Since I'm supposed to be out of touch Sitting up here in SARS country You know God what up But they won't do it I looked at the letters to the editor And both newspapers this morning And I went back a couple days just to make sure Because this episode happened on Tuesday With that commission meeting Was it to the Wednesday To the... Well whatever it was I went back a couple days to make sure I didn't miss anything There wasn't one letter to the editor From anybody or at least if there was they didn't print it Either paper about the Broward Commission And that resolution against the Patriot Act Nothing So it's like it never happened The Suncentland will put that on there 1159 at night on their website for one minute And then they bury it a little tiny paragraph And a stir about Muriam Elephant And that's it It's a major news story Here we go The place in the country where they've had a similar resolution past Big front page story It's all over the website Not in sound Florida Man you talk about goose stepping and pandering What about a Tommy? Hi you bald headed geek I hope they call his ass tonight and rip him a major asker And they won't But if anybody deserves it, it's a little Tommy jika You're so off out of it And he'd say, well gee I'd wrote that story defending me I don't need no defending All he knew was shine a spotlight that we let a word loose There are a big deal like that So like there's an issue about is there any issue? No, didn't anybody say anything about it? No, no And just in what he writes a whole column And he's afraid he's terrified because he's been so intimidated He's scared that that's a bit wacky Jacky's name And they're afraid of fear that he'll start up with them all over again We're talking under stand up But nevertheless, why write the column in the first place If you don't want to put any names in their Tom You little pussy he's been pushed to five jika That's his problem We have one more movie pulled it Since we've been movie intensive all week But we'll get to it momentarily Can take me about an hour and a half to get through yesterday's pull result Before we do that on a front page of the Harold's Speaking of your local fish wrappers You guys grab the resolution to take control of a rocky oil I just mentioned this in passing Okay The Bush administration's, oh it's payday today By the way, clearance I just mentioned that in passing too Okay, so I sure hope there's something big and fat in my mailbox The Bush administration circulated a draft resolution Among key security council members yesterday calling for the elimination of more than a decade Of international sanctions on Iraq and granting the United States Broad control over the country's oil industry and revenues until a permanent Iraqi government is in place How many years could that be? I've heard of me Yeah I got to read that last part again Granting the United States, broad control over the country's oil industry And revenues until a permanent Iraqi government's in place The resolution which was to be presented the 15 Nation body today The security council which should control the Iraq oil from the United Nations To the added states and its military allies with an international advisory board Having oversight responsibilities but little effective power A transitional Iraqi government which US authorities have said they Hope to establish within weeks would be granted a consultative role The proposed resolution would give the Bush administration Far greater authority over Iraq's lucrative oil industry Then US officials have previously acknowledged Please read that sentence again The proposed resolution would give the Bush administration far greater authority over Iraq's lucrative oil industry Then US officials would have previously acknowledged and as you just put out What I do with that article.

I'm getting frustrated about the fact that we realize that that much talent in this man. He's like wasting his time being a flunky for Greg Reid. You know, just being like a paper pusher. Don't you think American Idol would be a purpose-puffer duck, right? Huh? Absolutely. I'm serious. I think we are like sponsor his trip and set him to American Idol. Like, you know, make him into this gigantic career and get him out of the way from under Greg's thumb or star search at the very least. Star search would be great. Good luck. This instant. You know, I get with it. Get with it. You're wasting all of that talent. Got that great commercial voice, you know? And here he is sitting there like being a quizling for a guy that just, you know, refuses to let anybody decide which hand a wife they're asked with. No wonder people get neurotic in that joint, huh? It is paid a by the way, Clarence. I sure hope that thing is in my private box. You know what I mean? Your mail box. He knows how to my box. President want to be Graham. I'm evidence that Bush Blue 9.11. Now this is written a little bit sarcastic because of course it is in newsmax.com which is a ultra ultra right wing website. But that isn't where I got it because I never checked that thing. It was on, uh, where it was on BuzzFly I should have believed. So that makes it even that much more amazing. The fact that this isn't from some comic-pink-o-leftist website. President want to be Graham. I'm evidence that Bush Blue 9.11. Democratic presidential hopeful senator Bob Graham is reportedly sitting on damaging evidence that the Bush administration could have prevented the 9.11 attacks. But he hasn't released the information yet because it's classified. I think Bob Graham has a smoking pistol on the Bush administration congressional court release Craig Crawford told WBC radio's John Bachelors and Paul Alexander late Tuesday. Crawford explained that Graham's mystery evidence has to do with their failure is especially intelligence failures before 9.11. And recent wheat senator Graham the senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee had charged repeatedly that Bush bugled the war on terrorism. But the explorer governor has never publicly suggested that he thought the president had left America vulnerable to 9.11 attacks. Nevertheless. Crawford who's been covering the floor of Democrats presidential runs to the Graham obtained the Bush 9.11 evidence while serving as the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee to problem is that what Graham knows. And he knows some very damaging stuff about the Bush administration's failures before the 9.11 to prevent it. He can't talk about it because it's classified explained. Another reason for Graham's silence Republicans would likely complain that he's abused his position on the intelligence committee by turning it into a tool for opposition research still. Graham has been publicly hitting it what he knows when not going into detail. He quoted a recent speech in which the senator claimed, I know firsthand is former chairman of the Senate intelligence committee how little the administration has done to provide real security at home. While it's directed it's attention away from the war on terror abroad. Crawford said that the presidential hopeful is trying to figure out a way to make the 9.11 evidence against Bush public without violating the secrecy rules on the intelligence committee. I didn't like that, huh? From newsmax.com, no less boys and girls. Hmm. Let's see, Rich and Del Ray Beach says they aren't the sexiest movies, but they're surely. And he's got two. Yeah. Told you. And not only that, but this isn't even responsive to what I'm saying. Oh, this rich and Del Ray gets some help, Ray. Too many old yentres, I think are affecting your brain. They aren't the sexiest movies, but they are surely the most watched. The Wizard of Oz and the Tankman is, well, so what does that mean? We're not asking what he thinks of the most watched movies of all time. Where's can you? I don't give a crap who what other people are watching. Come on, Rich. Get a live sweetheart. God. This happens every stinking day, okay? Let me ask you this. Paper or plastic. Wood. And are they really that spastic? Are they? Yes, they are. Wow. The very first factor comes across the earth and cross my posts. And he don't get it all. What movie have you watched the most times? There we go. That's the question. It's as simple as saying what they're the week as it Friday, okay? Purple. People, leader. Purple haze. Get a poll. Purple veins. Purple pills. Oh, what's one of the movies is it where they were sitting around watching M&M? Was that one of the movies I watched? Did I see that in some non TV? Was that in, uh, I don't know. Isn't that in bully? Possibly? No. No. Where the hell was it? It's not what we told. No. But you're puncturing around watching M&M. I guess it was someone we thought we were seeing on television. What movie have you watched the most times? And then here's the choices so far. Never watched any movie more than once. Godfather one, which I'm positive is going to get a lot of oats. I could be wrong about that. I'm only me. But I think it's going to be a lot of oats. Leave the good. Take the good only. Once we're over to Kupu's nest, gone with a wind or a clockwork orange. That's our shirtless so far because we don't want to put a whole bunch of money. What movie have you watched? Not you think the public is watching more than anything else? I mean, that's so far off basits and just like you said, purple. What movie you watched purple? The color purple. A purple. Here's a call from West Palm Beach. Hello. Yeah, I know. Yes, sir. I tried to call you today the morning cherry wings died and couldn't get through. My brother called me from Boston early in the morning to let me know. But I got a quick story. We used to go up to the studios at the WMX in the next the Fenway Park in I guess it was 5758. And you could just come right in on Jerry's on the air and sit down. He had 10 and 12 chairs there. And one night he was opening up his mail. Part of his night we do these and there's piece of use tissue paper in there. So he opened it up and he turned to the audience. He said, you know, there's a direct home boy. He said this is what's out there. Yeah, yeah. We may time. I'm in front of you to be a regular when you wait 300 pounds. Right. I think I got a lot of time. And I would bring up sandwiches and he was a trip a guy. I can't believe it's the same person that's in the house. You know, in a car room is now for 12 years. And one final thing. I heard you talking about the movies and you mentioned Momento. And you know, I've listened to quite a bit now. And if you last 15 minutes into that movie, I'd be very surprised. Really? Total, complete nonsense. So I'll be interested to hear what you have to say. I'll be sure to tell me that before. It was expensive damn thing to it's a two. It's a two disc set there. It's like a special to luck. I think 45 bucks or something. Yeah, if you went to the movies, you'd be asleep in nine minutes. Okay. Thanks, pal. Bye. See you. Yeah, speaking of Jerry Williams, even though he did die several days ago, I would be really interested since Mr. Jick is going to be on for a day. Kated night after the baseball game till 2 in the morning. Maybe somebody won't want to ask Tom how come he didn't write anything about Jerry Williams.

But you'll recall and I pointed it out at the time the open at no place to waste your Perform did it say anything about Jerry working in the Sun Floor to mark and being on WNWS for a year, being a program director of the radio station and having gigantic ratings on that station.

These facts that we've gotten so far this morning were too far. It's incredible. It's as Haneel, I remember. This is the wrong one. Here it is. I know you hate money Python but the meaning of life was watched countless times by me. It's way for thin. Ready for that? Yeah, you hate money Python. I hate money Python. Where did that come from? We're always ripping them. Never, never playing it this one. Right, Thomas. I got your money Python. So I'm going to meet in history. Why won't you ever play this? Why won't you ever play that song? You never play that song. I put all these money Python bits in there. I believe that. You never play ever. Oh god. What is wrong on these people? Maybe they got the yellow pills today. This is the yellow pill. It's purple pill, okay? Your pop it around pills. God. I mean, your life. I watched that whole bunch of times. In fact, everybody put Python. We'll be as ever, but I was in life of Brian. Right. And then you write. So am I putting it down there? Yeah, sure. Meaning of life. I was asking. I'm going to put the life of Brian. If you think that's going to get more votes. Mm-hmm. I mean, I'm making adjustment there. But when I start out by how come you hate money? I know you hate them. Here's one from Murph who says invariably every Christmas, whether I want to watch your naughty watches. It's a wonderful life. Well, we got, oh, I'm telling another one. It's a wonderful life. And speaking of Christmas, a Christmas Carol. I'm writing down it's a wonderful meaningless life of Brian. A Christmas Carol. I don't even know how many times I've seen that one. What? A Christmas Carol. Now, we talking to which one we talking about. The one with Alice, you're sim? Right. That's the, that's become the definitive right, the one. There are some older ones that are we very early done. He would to me, he's the definitive screwed. Just like it's like a charlac Holmes, you know? There's only one charlac Holmes in that spazzle, Rathbone, and all these other ones are so lame, so weak. I want to watch another one because he was the definitive charlac Holmes. And the other ones who just are rip off, I won't have anything to do with them. There's only one Dr. Watson with Nigel Bruce, or Gary Bruce. And a same with Dracula. Right. All these Dracula imitators, not for me. I still can't find it. But today this weekend, we're going to order the tapes. Okay. Okay. It would, and what's the other one? Vaabah. Vaabah. Davidson. Vaabah. Mr. Murphy. What is it called? Vaabah. Vaabah. Vita. Vaabah. Because both of those are coming out on the DB. I don't know. I guess I could wait. Right. Yeah. I'm not in middle of June. I can wait. It's not like an emergency. And I'd rather, I'd rather get him on DBD anyway because that'll have to lie in times. I'm still thinking back to the, why do I hate money? I'm trying to come up with an answer for that. Because you're a bigot. You hate the brits. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, I got two waxes out of the same one. The beauty of the movie. Wait a minute. Why would you have two? How could you possibly have two? I watched these movies. One after another. At least once a month. Pick one. Beetle juice. Beetle juice? Yes. In the math. But Jim Terry. Me, the meadled juice. Okay. Beetle juice. It's, they just, they just, they just, they can't take risks. What they are, you know? They just can't go along with it. Whatever it is. Like I'm about to overrun chillin. What, one movie? What's single movie? Now which tune out which ten? Not which. Not thirty men. No. No. And kind of cut it either. What movie have you watched the most times? I mean, there are many movies that watched multiple times. Like I mentioned, I watched the fan again on TV with Lauren Baccold. And that was a good movie. I've seen that maybe three, four times. But there's, how many movies can there be that you've watched, Zidians of times? How many of those could they're possibly? Not third man? Like I said, I see I forgot what I just said about the people with too much time on her hands. I mean, Godfather one, I have seen all three of them multiple times. But Godfather one especially so many times. I couldn't even count the number times. A hundred or more maybe. Zidians. That would be my answer. How many times you've seen it? Zidians of times. But just we must go to the early early. Exactly. Here, here be lying in that movie. Right. Here be, here be lying. Daddy, fuck, tell you, we'll never get that movie. I don't get how many. Take off any what? Great, small, cumbersome out of the woodwork. I'm German Irish. Well, let me tell you something, my crock, McFriend. I'm going to make so much coffee. You, you won't know what it was. Come and lawyer. I have not threatened. I know almost every big lawyer we're doing. Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you? I'm going to hell a year. Exactly. 953 and 560. We're having a good time. We understand what it's all about. The audience is having a more. We're having a more communication from them. Probably because we're on AM. You have sure. Let's start some rumors that we're going on FM. Well, don't just think it's standing out where the country crap on kiss. That stuff is such garbage. You know? That stuff is so bogus, especially not that they're not playing the dixie chicks. Yeah, another thing, stop playing the dixie chicks. I think that we ought to move in there. And in fact, what we'll do is like in the middle of all the shows, we'll play dixie jick record. One half hour, we'll play dixie chicks. The other half hour will play duff. And if only that it's stuck. I, and now that's the interesting part because I don't like country music generally. All the Shania Twain, of course, she's made in A. Yeah. Shania's country. And she's great. She's like crossover pop, though. She's very pro. She's very pro. She's got Canadian. Special, uh, special condemnation for those cowards who, uh, cancel their appearances here, including J.Lo. They moved to Winniepeg. J.Lo. You can blow it out to your ass, J.Lo. And you know why it's she about that big compound there with, uh, with Ben Affleck? No. They're having two houses built. And they're not going to be staying in the same way. And that's what I'm thinking. Two, two huge houses built. And they're quite a distant support on the old plantation in Georgia, where we're going to run for her and one from that demon. And also, uh, Elton John and Billy Joel, they crapped out. Oh, we're afraid. We're afraid. Oh, God. There's nothing going on here. Man, everything is beautiful. Everything is lovely. Bell's wrong with these goddamn people. Put some morons. Whatcha, pussy? That's the problem. Too many cowards. Don't let me forget that column. Oh, I won't. Oh, and I'll take another comment. I'm going to read today another bedtime story. There's so many good ones. No time to get Swedish by Nick Christoph. That's that scary. That article that column is today in the times. That is downright scary. No, is he eating? This one scientist warning another and email to his other age researchers. He says, in, uh, he's advising staff to speak in code. They're worried that their emails are being intercepted. Uh, I'll read this whole thing later. But he says, phone communication does not appear. Taped at this time. Even so, I'm advising staff to speak in code and listen. NIH staff member indicates you can speak freely. In short, assume you're living in Stalinist Russia when communicating with the United States government. You ready for that? Yeah. Yeah. I was ready for it. Hmm. Nation of cowards by Sydney Hall, Jr. I'm going to get to that. And neocons, dances, strouse walls. This is a really, in fact, there's several articles about this. But this was the best one. Is United States foreign policy being run by followers of an obscure German Jewish political philosopher whose views were a latest a moral and hostile to democratic government? Suddenly, political Washington is a buzz about Leo Strauss who arrived in the US in 1938 and taught at several major universities before his death in 1973. But I just mention these things in passing, okay? Take him or leave him. You know, because most of you will go through life going to, like that. Some of you will go through life going to, like that, like Greg Reid. And some of you might actually pay attention. 1957 at five, 60 WQM, the mad dogs, coming up at one hank, the humpers in the studio today.

Penaq's early prescriptions and subsequent open letters to president George W. Bush and how to fight the war on terrorism have anticipated to an uncanny extent precisely what the administration has done must be just a coincidence don't you think? Crystal's father Irving the godfather of Neo conservatism was sits on the board of the American enterprise institute the AEI were a number of prominent hawks including former defense policy board chairman Richard Pearl are based has also credited Strauss with being one of the main influences on his thinking. While a New York Times article introduced readers to Strauss and his disciples in Washington interest was further peaked this week by a lengthy article and they buy the New Yorkers legendary investigative reporter Seymour Hirsch in the relationship to Sunny who noted that Abraham Schultzke, a close-prolistened social who was run a special intelligence unit in Rumsfeld's office is also a Straussian. His unit according to Hirsch reinterpreted evidence of Iraq's alleged links to some of the law's al-Qaeda terrorist network and possession of weapons of mass destruction to support those new administration determined to go to war with Baghdad. The article also identified Stephen Kim-Bohn, one of Rumsfeld's closest aids was the new post of under-secretary defense for intelligence as a Strauss follower. In his article Hirsch wrote that Strauss believed the world of be a place where isolated liberal democracies live in constant danger from hostile elements abroad and where policy advisors may have to deceive their own publics and even their rulers in order to protect their countries. Shady Adruary author of 1999's Leo Strauss in the American rights is that Hirsch is right on the second count but dead wrong on the first, Strauss would need the re-libral lower democrat she said in the telephone interview from her office at the University of Calgary in Canada, perpetual deception of the citizens by those in powers critical in Strauss's view because they need to be led and they need strong rulers to tell them what's good for them. The Vymar Republican Germany was a model of liberal democracy for which he had huge content added to Rory, liberalism and Vymar in Strauss's view led ultimately with the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews. Like Plato Strauss taught that within societies some are fit to lead others to be led, according to Rory but on like play to who believed that leaders had to be people with such high moral standards that they could resist the temptations of power Strauss taught that those who are fit to rule are those who realize there is no morality and that those only one natural right to run of a superior to rule over the inferior. For Strauss religion is the glue that holds society together said Rory who ended that, Irving among other Neo Conservatives as argue that separating church in state was the biggest mistake made by the founders of the US Republic. Secular society in there if he was the worst possible thing because it leads to individualism, liberalism and relativism precisely those traits that might encourage descent which in turn could dangerously weaken society's ability to cope with external threats. You want to crowd that you can manipulate like Patti according to Dury. And it goes on you can be the whole article on a website. Yeah, exactly. Well, that's what's happening, man. You see it. You see it. It's right there in front of you. Either you know either get yourself said about it. Do something about it. What you've whipped up to a frenzy or just, yeah keep going like that. Yeah. It's all right out there. And we had another article which I'm not going to waste the time reading or at least I probably won't. About the fact that this whole thing coming upon June 2nd of the FCC, it's already a done deal. The FCC's media bureau has vetted staff recommendations for changes to a string of media ownership rules with all five commissioners and the chosen proposals have been probably endorsed by the commissioners three Republican members. In other words, it's that, you know, it's three to two. The Republicans have the edge on the FCC. It's a done deal. While the recommendations were in finalized late yesterday, it's expected the process to be completed by Monday. The eighth say there's wide agreement among the Republican majority over the biggest issues. There you go. Come June 2nd. You're going to have a clear channel all over your body. They're going to be in your nose in your ears up your back dome. That's right in your ass. Clear channel. Everywhere you look. Everywhere your station is going to sound the same. Every newspapers are going to have the same crap. Every television says it's going to be spoon the same damn up. Pepperally propaganda. That's it. You lose. 1013 at 5.60.

Sean and Holly would have as out of control says, if I could afford it, I would have a chip implanted my front of low playing the Maltese falcon on a continuous loop. If only to hear sand and spade, how if it broke out, say to Peter Laurie, Joel Cairo, when you're slapped, you'll take it and like it. Yeah. You can act like a man. What come on? Even if the slapping doesn't cause the effeminate Cairo to act like a man. I've seen it more times than Charles Manson has seen the parole boards as Sean and Holly would. OK, let's get that on our Maltese falcon. That was a great movie. OK, I always thought once. I, I don't know how many times I saw, but I mean, not one that would watch a lot. See, this is an interesting thing. Because when you come right down to it, like, like, you know, songs, if you like a song, you want to hear it over and over and over again. Right. Song last like three, four minutes, whatever it is. Use to be like two minutes. But with movies, I mean, movies is an investment of time. Our and a half, two hours, long movies, some are like even up to three hours, maybe even more. I'll tell you one, I can't find that really pisses me off that I would like to see again on DVD. Once upon a time in America. Yeah. I'm sure it's out there. That's an underrated movie. And then like I said, the only frustrating thing about it is is the ending is so bad. Because you get to the ending and then you write that crap about well, you know, the director said that, you know, there was an opium trip or so. And the whole movie. In other words, it didn't even really happen. Right. Okay. Hate that. Yeah. And you feel like in the movie, it lasted us forever. But 30 minutes. 30 hours. It's what, maybe one to longest movies ever made. The uncut, the original director's version was, they edited and they chopped the way down because they want to put like three and a half hour movies in the theater. In fact, you remember when Godfather was a Godfather, two? Was that the one that was real super long? There was an intermission in that movie. Yeah. Now, back in the old days, I mean, real old before you were born. But back in the good old days, they used to have an intermission in movies frequently. Right. All of the animation wasn't between parts of a movie. The animation would be between the main features. You go and you'd have your cartoon, I don't remember what order they were. You'd have your cartoon, you're 50 minutes cereal, like rocket man or Zoro or Superman, your Cody. Oh, come on. I love that. That was the rocket man, command. Right. And then news real, which would be five or ten minutes. And then you'd have your first feature and then there'd be an intermission and in between you'd have like another cartoon or some man previews, you know, previews have come in the fractions and then you have a second full feature. So back in those days, it was like a day at the movies. Right. As opposed to now, where you go into these multiplexes and there's like 75 different, well, at least I've heard of the man. The theaters and, you know, it's an hour and a half flick. And each one is showing a different one and that's it. Sure, it sure is how they'll see no cartoons anymore. No. You don't see any news real, that's for damn sure. Although, you know, something don't tell this administration about that. They'll be putting palm palm scenes with the, you know, the troops returning with the holding the babies again. Every time you go to see a movie, you'll be watching those scenes again. This is a sublimable. I wouldn't surprise me if they do the sublimable thing and they're like they'd travel to co-spice and the popcorn thing. Remember that? I, huh? When did they stop doing that? In fact, maybe they never stopped. That's right. They started doing that with a sublimable advertising where they would put in little clips of popcorn and soda and candy and you didn't even realize they were in there. Right. That's just product placement. And the purpose being to like subliminally and make you hungry so that you'd run, you'd go rushing out of the counter by a bunch of crap and make all your teeth fall out of popcorn. Popcorn, right. They would, popcorn candy. Which piece? That would. That would be a great pool to take some. They do we ever do that? Favorite theater food? Yeah, favorite food. Yeah, I like steak. Yeah, there you go. How about some pizza would be good, huh? Pizza's a nice good thing to eat at the, uh, or how about Kentucky fry? How about like a nice big bucket of Kentucky fried at the favorite theater would be good? Just ate the same normal man. Just ate the same. It's a whole different experience. It just like the thing with the DVDs now. I mean, why not what you waste your time go to movie theater when you can get these things on DVD? Not that much. Sure, but all the extra good stuff and then the Easter eggs. Oh, god. I can't wait to figure that out. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Yes, I, I got a movie today. My favorite movie is Fast Times at Ridge Mill High. And yes, yesterday's poll, I was wondering what the movie that I thought was the shit of an honor was crying game. It was on there. Oh, it wasn't on there. It wasn't on there because it wasn't the end of the movie. It was the first 20 minutes of the movie. Oh, that's right. Yeah, somebody suggested that. It wasn't on there because the ending wasn't what was great. I'm blind. I didn't get it till the end. Okay. All right. You have a good one. You put up YouTube value. Thanks. Thank you. Have you heard of the penis? Didn't tip him off, I guess? The penis? Oh, she was a guy. Right. I didn't see that movie to crying game. Oh, okay. I'm not in those, uh, pervert kind of movies. I like something like, you know, Alice in Wonderland. Something really normal like Alice in Wonderland with a man header in the Chisher cat. Oh, the header was stuff. Right. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T. And Verizon, where else line? What movie have you watched the most times? Now, now see what else would be what's your favorite movie? Not necessarily. No. Because I still think and it's difficult, it is so hard but I think that my favorite movie is still not worth it.ถ who is healthy, baby. Oh, oh, oh. They like I told you, just watched them out two thirds of it again the other day. But you know when you're watched them will be too often at when you can't watch it all the way through. Because you just know what's going to happen. Right? You don't buy rope. But they're certain parts of it that you just so obsessed with. You cannot turn it off. I'll get back to you, Diane. Diana. The scene in his office where she's pitching to put Beal back on the air. He says, You're talking about putting a man, a fessly irresponsible man on national network television and she stands there with at Bethlehem, not in her head. It's just a sensational. Well, I'd have to run it by what it stands in practices. I missed a buddy who wanted to know about it. But I'll get back to you, Diana. I think that's my favorite movie, but I have not seen it anywhere near his mate. Well, first of all, it's not it's almost never on television. One of reasons being that network television probably is like a little bit of verse to putting on there because it's an indictment of exactly what they become. But the godfather, I mean, every time you turn around, there it is. There is the man, I'm not not going to do that because you can't turn it off. Right? Just like this show. Just like the people are claim that they hate this show. They need hate it, but they can't turn it off. 1026 at 560 QMIC Pompano Park spot here, but I don't have any copies from just going to wing it. I... Well, no, because it's unfortunate because I'm sure that Steve Wolf and our close personal friend Troy Stranger were likely to know what's going on there. Anyway, the path there's in the heat are well done for the season stick a fork in them they're done. And college basketball finito, the dolphins don't get started for another three months.

The power of Christ, you'll praise you. The power of Christ, you'll praise you. That's what makes his the anxiousest of course. I've seen that several times, but not in the category where the Godfather. In fact, in the early running on here, and if also be a little slow coming because obviously people are going to wait to see the movie that is the one that they saw so much. Godfather, one 19, Star Wars 13. I didn't even know we had Star Wars on the list. I put it down there when we were talking this morning. I forgot this. Yeah, because I told you it would be on there. Star Wars 13, Wizard of Oz 11, Christmas story eight. I don't even know what a Christmas story is. Stone with a little kid, and he gets the gun for Christmas. He wants the gun for Christmas, and you'll shoot your eye out. Never saw it. It's like a 40's movie. It looks never saw it. Probably a movie for Graham. It's a wonderful live seven. Oh, I'd speak of a beiner boy. Rumor I heard there was that, you know, Aaron that sent us those pictures yesterday. Amy and Aaron. I hear that he got Aaron's number. I couldn't be wrong about that, but that's the rumour going around the building. In fact, what I heard the actual, the whole story was I heard that he and him are like wrestling in a hive and like a brawl this morning. And it came to find out they were, or I'd muffers trying to get the phone number away from him. It's a wonderful live seven. Never watched any movie more than once for. See, I told you. National Anthemification three gone with a win three life of Brian three. 2001 space out of C three, clockwork arms are pure jaws to 10 and then from there on as a smattering. Did we put deliverance on there? Not yet. Well, I know. No, what's that yet? Well, we'll wait till somebody says it. Because if I do that, then I'll have put on more than one myself. And we were only allowing one. In fact, here's another one. JK from Hollywood. We love you JK, but you got like a whole as plus. He's got the first one fast time of Ridge Months high, which that's going to get a bunch of votes because there's another fact. So I've seen that one easily two thousand times and somebody called it in fast times of Ridge Month high. So we'll put that on her. But if you put like a whole bunch of them, I'm just going to Schmidt can your facts. Okay. Because what's the point? Right? I get to name a bunch of movies. That's like asking me. What's my favorite flavor of flavor of ice cream? And I list you every flavor that's several are like butter pecan vanilla chocolate is pretty. I like Rocky Road. It's it's just not that difficult. I understand that we're requiring you to make a judgment. Make a pick one. Make a judgment. But every pool that we take where we let the audience know kind of like build the pool, which is great because it kills time. And you audience, despite of the fact that they claimed on that one pool we took that day, believe me, this is their meat and potatoes, man. This is what they can sink their teeth in. We just keep that in mind. Mm-hmm. Spide of all the miles on. That's the last thing we want to hear as these long ponders pull. No, it's not. You love it. Plus I sneak in my bedtime stories. We get all the good stuff in there. Don't forget join Joe Costello who used to be a hell of a good broadcaster. Join Joe today noon to two with the Verizon Wireless Tour 3333 North Federal Highway in Pompano. Stop by to get some free Marlins tickets for the night's game against the Colorado Rockies. And registered when tickets were upcoming home game. I still don't look confused them. What happened with the All-Star. They made it some promotion that's over. Or maybe Doreen took Miguel's toys away. I don't know what to deal with. Bill and four Laterdale says Star Wars absolutely positive without it. And quickly his answer is Star Wars. Episode four I knew hope the real well. Oh wait a minute. See, this is going to be like Godfather where we are. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Everybody knows what we're talking about. Oh, the movie Lucas made when he was broken. Telled it before he sold a sold of the devil for it. He's beyond his wildest dreams and started to look, oh, that's right. Cause all the other stuff is like that retro crap. Right. We don't want no retro crap. Okay, thank you, Bill. Steven Miami says Neil George and Biner boy and Ace Ventura wanted to list. He's seen it a whole bunch of times and he says, God, man. Okay, got it. Ace Ventura won. Got it. I don't even know what they all had. Ace Ventura pit detected. Oh, no, what do I have? Oh, yeah, Jim Carrier. It's surprisingly. It didn't suck. And the second one was even better. You know, I liked Jim Carrier a lot. Yeah. But it's the movies he makes that I don't like. I just like the second movie was actually funny. Was it really? It was. I was the part of your word for it. I listen at least at this stage of the way things are going on. I'm not going to have time left in my lifetime to watch all the movies that I got on list now. Even though once I got in the other room sitting there, all the DVDs and my DVDs. Here's what it says. If you like Motown music, which I do love, check out the documentary, standing in the shadows of Motown. It's about the funk brother's Motown's sessions musicians have played more. I'm more hits than Elvis DeBetels than Rolling Stones combined. It says like you and George have seen the godfather dozens of times. Not good man. Especially parts one and two. I won't forgive Robert Duval for doing days of thunder instead. And when I'm a writer to be a boyfriend, Johnny to be with a boyfriend, Johnny that believing godfather to and giving us George Hamilton and Sophia Coppola. Had Tom Hagan and Connie. Look what we got. Oh, and then he's got a list of 75 other movies he see many, many times. But, and it says if you add young children, you saw the Lion King a little more made a lot also. But godfather one, I'm assuming after star wars in this case. Got it? Got all these? Godfather one, Cook, who's next gone with the wind? Talk recordings, life of Brian, it's a wonderful life. A Christmas Carol Ocean's 11 Beetle Juice, National Lion Pulling Vacation, 2001 in the Space Odyssey. What's that one with us? 2000 won in Space Travesty with Leslie Nielsen? Right. That's been out a few times but I haven't watched you. Have you seen it? Nope. Can't be bad. His Leslie Nielsen, ever been in a bad movie. I don't think so. He's Canadian, eh? Worship of ours. Christmas story, George. You don't like Leslie Nielsen? Of course I do. I was kind of a pawn. You know, in a Scarlet's like a long pregnant pause like that. He was talking to me. Can you hear me? No, it was important. It was important. Yeah, we were discussing Oceans 11. I don't remember anybody saying that neither does he but nevertheless it's on there. Oceans 11 was on a phone call. Somebody did mention Oceans 11. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. See, this is what I put up with. Folks, I got the two beeners there in this video and they just, and the reason the poll doesn't always come out the way you think it's going to come out and things disappear things get added in is because I'm doing one show. And then the two of them are doing another show. Somebody called in and said Oceans 11. Now maybe you're hearing maybe you have Rush Limbaugh disease. Maybe you're hearing is going to Bodea. What? See? A Christmas story, Josh, hearing loading a Las Vegas candy shack airplane, which was hysterical. Having a sale at J.C. pennies, he was the best. That's true cake. He was hysterical. Leon. Was that his name? He was a panic. And also what's his name? Lloyd Bridges. Who was sniffing glue? It kind of reminded me of the mole myster, you know? I'll get to it. I'll find it. It isn't here somewhere. I picked the bad date of Quitsmith and glued right. Lloyd Bridges was upside down in that one scene. First viewers day off. Maltese style confessed times at Richmont High. It's going to get a lot of votes. The exorcist. Network. And a spinture one. Is that actually the name A spinture a petty tech to a spinture a petty tech to a petty tech to a. Well put on it. What have you been like? I'll know what it is. How about Jesse Ventura? How about that MSNBC and the Jesse Ventura thing? Why are you talking about embarrassing? Have you noticed what you probably don't watch it? And I almost never do any more. I don't watch CNN underpendally at that. But if I ever flip it around and I get to MSNBC, they keep changing the times of the shows. It reminds me of the old PD Volder thing. I was doing the last gasp of their talk format before they sold out and became Fox Sports with their marginal fractional numbers. And they do the same thing. And they move a bill press and a pack you can and they're on like five. I don't know. Nobody has any idea what time those shows are on. The big threat. Nostmen. I think they just took him off to the fat farmer something. And that's their new deal on there now. So anyway, Jesse Ventura. I don't think that show is ever going to see the light of day. I think that when he did the interview with the soldiers, I think that was it. That was the nail in the coffin. That was the one show. This is what we put you on the ear for was that. And I think that was the end of him. Offer. We're like you, Jesse, but get a life. Get fine to real job. Go back to wrestling. That's his thing. 1041 is 560 W to kill me on Mother's Day is only the day after tomorrow. It's just two days away.

Fastest qualifying race ever. Art major. 151 and 1 at mo-hawk. In a qualifying race. Oh, my God. This was today. It must have been this morning. 151 and 1 were the last half in 54 and 1. Are you following that with Chris Chris stopper win a bike? You know Chris Chris stopper. We don't see Chris Chris stopper. Let's see. Here's what it says. Maybe you should say, yeah, maybe we should say comedy or drama or maybe we should make this a 40 part. What comedy did you watch more than any other movie? What drama did you watch? What sci-fi? No. No. No. It's, you know what, no matter what you do, like I've always said, it's never the right thing. It's kind of like with my mother, you know? No matter what you do, it's not the right thing. It's not the way you should have done it. You didn't ask her by question. Baba, Baba, Baba, Baba. Too bad. But she was a nice girl. Why didn't you like her? No, my mother never said that. No. Good morning. And we'll be. I can watch over and over again. Mel Brooks Space Balls. Okay. We got Space Balls on there. We're going to do that. How about Springtime for Hitler? Oh, the producers. We're going to talk about space for space for Hitler. Why not say a lot of Hitler talk these days for obvious reasons. Space Balls, okay? Jane. Our, listener and for a lot of Dale Jane says, just to prove we were point about censorship in USA. And in PR this morning, they had their letters from listeners. The announcer admitted they'd received a flood letters about a story. They did it about Halle Burton's bid free government contract. But the only letter they read was from one who said, what other company can handle the job? Then they went on to read two letters about Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street. Is that incredible? No. Very good. I've watched the most in that can still say enjoy it. It is blues brothers. Let's get that on there, okay? I saw that once. That was enough. And not that I don't like it, Jane. It was fine. How's John Adunis Day? Talked it. Poor John Bolusia. Fat, lots of drugs. Dead. So that was wondering if you may know whatever happened to a newscaster on CNN name, David Gutno. What? And she goes on, I have no idea who that is. I hope he's working in Cannibal. Good luck, Jane. Jane's great, but she always puts something on there. I have no idea what she's talking about. I saw gaslight, Jane. Okay. Believe me, you're not full on this kid. Although I do feel a little like Angry Birdman today. Technically, today for lunch, I'll go on. Give me a good steak. Well, did they burn Earth a steak? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T. Maybe I've been looking not quite as much as in Good Birdman. Here's a lady in Voighten Beach, hello. Hello. Yes, man. Hi, I was just wondering if I could just breakfast at Disney's? How many times did you see that? Oh, probably at least 3 dozen times. Not 3 to man. Okay, you got it. Okay, thanks. Thanks for talking. I'll keep listening. Okay, thanks. Thanks. I'm talking. Breakfast at Tiffany's. Audrey Hepburn. I told you she was beautiful and inspired where you said she was scrawny. She was skinny. Bird lady. I'll tell you who else is scrawny is Jared Lito from Recreem for a dream. He's a good user couple of sandwiches. I was all know that smack. Well, okay. Is that the idea that he had like a buck down? Right. But that movie you might have to point there. Maybe he's not really that slim. Because I'll be honest to picture that you emailed me. See, this isn't going to go well for George's reputation, which is already suffering from all the earth. He's been on the show. It's like marginal and best whatever. But when he and Carlos are both emailing me pictures of the building guys. Let's see. Where is the picture? Where to call it? There he is. Yeah, see, he don't look like real scrawny in that picture. No. So we probably like bulk down. You probably wouldn't like on a caring carpet or diet for a couple of weeks. Mm-hmm. Because he had looked like real anorexic. Because when you're doing as many drugs, we shouldn't be saying all these things. We'll give it away. When you're doing as much of that crap as he was doing. And then he had that arm problem too, you know. Oh, my! Oh, talk about purple. Woo! Man, people veins. Mm-hmm, purple veins. Not just your ordinary kind of like purplish, but real purple veins and purple arm and purple. Well, you don't have that problem anymore with that arm. Just waiting for scenes with Lee Marvin, one of the best actor for this movie was worth watching this movie, at least 80 times. He's hilarious as a... Drunken gunslinger and cat blue. Got it? Got it? Got it? Not to be confused with catman do. Cat blue. Lee Marvin, great actor. He's been dead a long time. Can we die from? Smoking? Smoking. Long cancer. Ah, heavy smoker. Heavy, heavy duty. It says the scene at the end when he was supposed to rescue cat from the gallows. The idiot found him on his drug and horse. The horse leaned against the mercantile building with its leg cross said, your eyes. Marvin said what's wrong with me? Indian, they're all red bloodshot. Marvin, you ought to see him from my side. That's cute. Let's see, movies broadcast on TV. You bet of course. I can't take it against that. No, you must have seen it sitting down in a movie theater, but at least a whole bunch of seats. I've heard of me. Right. If so. And then to top that off, then they're adding insult to injury. He was too. Here she is. Beastmaster and back to the future. Ah. Should we put one of them on there? Well, because it's first beastmaster. Okay. Okay. I wish I should smith can. But yeah broadcast on TV counts. Okay. How do you spell cat blue? C-A-T-B-L-E-W. B-L-U-E. B-A-L-L-O-U. Beiner boy. Got it. Oh, wouldn't it be it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that out of here. Mania. Movie I've watched the most times is take a man with such a sharpness. And do we have that on there? I thought we did that. I thought we did too. We didn't. You see it? I was talking about Gerald and Heston. Maybe we just, I don't know. We screwed up. Well, today I'm going to put that in there because otherwise we'd like, we'd have a slighted portrait. Oh, there it is. It's just got five votes. It's on there. Okay. Maybe I just didn't write it down. But this has five votes. Godfather was got 39. Star Wars 20. Wizard of Oz 19. Christmas story 13. It's a wonderful life. Nine. Whether you want to or not. I mean, it's like for the two weeks before Christmas. That's not every five minutes. In fact, I think it's a law now since Bush got in every year. They have to show it a whole bunch of times every Christmas. Not third man. At least that's the minimum. National Ampunes Vacation 7, 10 Commandments 6. That's six votes. Like I just said, draw six.

I mean, shot like that. But he looked really bad. Horrible. Uh, but the, the part of making movies that you saw in the movie theater more than one. Now, that's not the pull question. See, I shouldn't even mention it because that'll cloud the issue, I mean, if you're already trying to murky murky the waters up anyway. You see, I mean, obviously there are movies that are that great that when a first came out back in those days anyway, back like in the 70s. You never saw them would be on TV for years, if ever. I like it is now. We didn't have those show time and HBO all as stuff. Uh, so if you want to see movie again, you'd go back and see it again, like sometimes the next day was so good. I can't think of any of that I ever did that with. But there are people who did. I think that there were people who went to see the extra just again, right?

All that superimposed pezuzu. I could have done it without. Pezuzu. That was that demon that they kept showing. Oh yeah. That was no big deal. But when she came down to stairs backwards. Yeah. That's kind of treating with her hands like her arms were like over the her. I don't know how to explain it. That was a great compliment. That was a great compliment. Yeah. She was great.

It's just one of those movies that stays with you. You can just crack off a line from the movie in any situation. I vote for that one. Hands down. Okay. Thanks. Have a great day. You too. You know, I'm thinking this. I'm embarrassed to say this because I pride myself. I know one so much of the dialogue from all three of the god fathers. But that line that she brings back in godfather three that I'm always chastizing your kinises Michael. Now they will fear you. Now where do they actually say that in the first one? I'm thinking now they will fear you. Ah. Gotcha. I'll get somebody in the audience. We'll know we have a lot of godfather experts out there. Somebody will know. I'm embarrassed because we should know that. Yeah, we should. Now they will fear you. We got them broke over there.

You're ready to tell me. Yeah. Online one that got the answer to the. To where that line came from. You forgot about the afro man movie with a J. Insan and Bob in it. The afro man movie. The video. I never saw the video. Sorry to that. Where do you think we got the audio from Mr. Well, I guess he's he's doing so many of it. He's starting to get normal cancer in real now. Here's somebody with the answer to our question. Hello. Yes. Hi. Great. I have the answer to your question. Okay. The opening scene when he's dealing with the. Undertaker anyone. And Undertaker wants to have the. You know, a commission for. Who was under his daughter. And he said if you would come to me. To the police and the few. Right. You know, when he. Because he said then they will. Yeah, and then they would hear you. Then they was. You're not. Now. Right. Then they was. See, and I should know that because I just got through a plan. What are you? What are you? What are you? You know, I think that. I'm not. I'm not. Thank you so much. I'll save me from the whole weekend because we had the line wrong anyway. Although that's what that's what Jesus in five out of the three kind of His is Michael now they will fear you when he turns around and looks at her. It says maybe they should fear you. And then it's so. It's so lame. It's so sad and you want to cry. I mean, I still say it's a highly underrated movie. It's got a lot of good stuff in here. It's got too much of the truth that the people like Dennis can handle. But it's just really great. But they did so many things to try to destroy it. And I think effectively they did a good job. Including her with a big shnaz. And the corny lines and bring it back lines. We've been through this a million times. Bring it back lines from the other two that don't fit in at all. Maybe they ought to fear you. And see that that's part of his, you know, he's sticking. And where he does stuff that's just so. So lame, you know. He can be so brilliant. And then I have a hand, do things that he just isn't such a way. Like we're watching a comedy movie, you know. Hey, here's the funny. Godfather. Here's the comedian gangsters. They're a panic. 1113.

We better get that on there right away because certainly on QAM I would say animal house If we had the sports or it's voting animal house and candy shack Just be everything else hands down Right, okay, because if you tune in any of our sports shows, Any tendons they're talking movies, you they don't talk about the godfather Certainly not about network, any of the stuff we're hearing about today They talk about animal house and candy shack And maybe on happy Gilmore You'd be unhappy too if you turper or need an afrish game back Anyway, here's one going my way with big crossbeat Oh, I watched it every year at Christmas and I cry every time Got it going my way?

Like I said, look at the paper Now he hurts very fussy about the spelling Even though he screws it up most of the time So he he'll mind being corrected on that unless it's beiner boy That's correct him Then he gets really hostile, starts eating just frustration Eating just jamming it down his push Here's one, bachelor party says Peter, my me beach bachelor party Would Tom Hanks never saw it, never heard of it But Peter says he seen it Not third man?

No, this is the act of a coward A scholar who advises the White House concludes that force and fear are the only way to win the cycle of terrorism that perpetuates itself Because of force and fear He doesn't even think about finding the reasons for the problem or the solutions This is the act of a coward And the president comes forth smirking and swaggering Dressing and military garb and clothing We've seen him from the worst of world leader We've seen this from the worst of world leaders before the Stalin's and Hitler's And they are presently not rise to the same level of evil He resembles them uncoctably They are the leaders that did what they did and smirking swaggered while they did it because they were essentially cowards too We have it seems at last the combination of cowards Cowardists is woven itself right in the fabric of our lives A nation of cowards except those who aren't and there are many And the heart of every American there's a bravery waiting to emerge if someone would come along Who'd call on that bravery if another Martin Luther King came suddenly to our midst You'd see bravery flour everywhere overnight We are all of us after all just human Sydney Hall, Junior Please am good stuff Hardware hardware I take But it is Absolutely correct Okay, here's some taxes Unlike some of your pools where I find it hard to narrow it down This one's easy for me the greatest cape This movie was my favorite when I was six years old Still enjoyed today a tremendous cast with their settings to a loosely based on fact Whenever it's on the cable which is often I'm sucked in the same as true of the godfather I stare watching the greatest cape many years earlier Lot of years Not third man Right TR and Hollywood says how about the matrix Watched it a couple of dozen times It's in the VCR in the spare room all the time turn it on and watch forward backward upside down whatever I'm in there Got it Also TR said you'd notice they moved crossfire to 430 For only a half an hour because there was too much liberal talk right and then I'm scared time when there's a latent drive time when nobody's watching Yeah, no great lost dog, you know I tried to see that bow tie Kind of hard to choke a guy when he gets pissed off and what if he's wearing a bow tie You could see the TV Richers alive on guiding light Just in case anybody ain't but watching last couple of days Richers alive That's gonna be a tough one to explain away Reva went to jail for turning off the life support after got into a car wreck and he died months ago Okay, now all of a sudden only on the soap operas he's alive he's back U.H.F. by word on the anchor Vic somebody says features local girl Victoria Jackson you got U.H.F.

Yes The ruttles Rob Ryan or road directed in the start in this is spinal tap a spoof about the music industry Since you're in the entertainment visual appreciate things as censorship Soul and egos like mobile and general chaos. I've seen this movie about a hundred and about thirty man times man We enjoyed a lot of your showlessness as much as we can for us for the bedtime stories We wouldn't know what was going out there.

They won't do it anymore than they'll even write letter to the editor and he and either one of our newspapers. Can you believe that nobody wrote letter about that Broward Commission resolution? No, I don't believe it. I can't believe it. I think you people are suppressing the news at the Sun sent on the goddamn army here. Okay, I think that's what you're doing. Try to cover your tracks. Oh, that's not a story. Let's put it in about 40,000 more words about Mr. Eagle and about, uh, about Mary of Elephant, okay. That's all people care about. Jesus, K Christ, I know what I'm thinking. What? Nestle's turtle ice cream in a big bowl melted down in a microwave for a few seconds. With scores, bites, and with cream on to not forget about and marshmallow on top. It's sizzled with hot fudge. Oh, stop. And cherries. And cherry. Some of the cherry juice from the bottles in a drizzle around the edges. Oh, I think I'm my blood sugar to just one of 80 points. Maybe not 80, but a lot. Not 30 minutes. Oh, stop it. You ever had scores, bites, huh? No, yeah. How about being one of the OCDB in a way that everybody likes. I don't like chocolate. Your taste is in your tush, man. That's what Muff said. That's what he told me. He said pretty tasty. Tush. What movie have you watched the most times in your life? That's our full question. We're spending half the time on a show trying to explain the question, which is good. It kills from good time. And then once we, once they understand what the question is, then they say, oh, well, look at back to you. Confather 169, Star Wars 43, Wizard of Oz 32, Airplane 22, and then you look from there. 5605, 60 pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. I think what I'm going to do is if I can't, because I don't want to sit around here on a Friday night, listen to a Stimstupid Show. I think I'll tape the jick a thing. Well, he's on. I want to hear his lame answers. His lame excuses for why he does such a piss-forward job. Covering what's happening in the local media in this town. Oh, it's poor. Huh? I'm sure he'll address all those issues. Well, in other words, no, and I'll one person that had the foot's for the balls to call it, and put him on the spot about it? No, no. Oh, geez. I'm going to be didn't talk about the dog track. Here's Miami, hello. Hey, I'm connu, how you doing? Okay, sir. Question. Did anybody answer your godfather question about, and the godfather won when did they say, and they won? You want to? Yes, he did. Bonaceta, Bonaceta. I'm going to be getting a movie. I'm not going to be serious. I know you probably might have a good experience. I don't think you like it, but... Well, what was it? It's got nothing to do with it. I know, I don't. I know, but it's one of the movie I've seen probably the most in my life. It's the matrix. Okay. I think we got that on there, don't we? We just put it on there. We just stuck it on there. All right. I don't put you. Have a good day. And you, too. See whether I agree with it or whether I like it or not, is totally irrelevant. That's what makes this so easy. You're not going to have to convince us of anything. If that's the movie you've watched 50 million times, that's what we want to know about. That's what a question of whether George agrees with you. And I have to get his seal of approval today. I'm like most other polls. When if he gives it all, it looks at you across. I forget it. He gives it like just a wrong sign. Like, eh... You're more cute on there. Come on. Let's hear it. Eh. Eh. Ha. Oh, and those people are waiting for the mad dog and at where you would a dredge pack in. We have the one that he did that we are couldn't use. We have the, uh, not yet heard new one. Were you dredge packin'? Oh great. Well, what do we even hold him back on that for? We were just told. You mean to say that my psychic powers kicked in again? You got it. I just laid it up right now. No. Three minutes ago during the last break is a matter of fact. Are you shitting me? I'm telling you, seriously. I'm not using my psychic powers to the fullest. If I would really put my head to it, I could just say, hey, screw everybody. Hey, Greg, have a nice life. Go get a haircut and I could just put my go to the track or do something. See, my problem is when I go to the track, I allow myself to be influenced by certain other people. You know what I mean? I don't want to show no names to them. Certain other people. Oh, the full room done great. And papa, papa, papa. I saw a lot of crap about who warmed up like this, you know. You could be the Gypsy Queen. Yeah, or at least part of that. Were you dredge packin'? Ha ha ha ha ha. That's great. Oh. That is sensational. I like the enthusiasm and puts it in that, you know, if, in fact, wait a minute, let's play these back to back. Let me play this one first. Because this one isn't quite as mighty as mine, I mean, it's fine, but were you fudge packin'? Were you dredge packin'? Yeah, see how much has just a little bit more enthusiasm. I just got mad dog thank you. See, he's always there for us. He always obliges. He's got a sick twisted sense of humor. And then, of course, there's the hump. I still want to give a spider-port how the hump are bonded with Moat, the ratings party together. And I must have been really, really something. Probably what started off on her on the right note was when Hank walked in and looked up out of and said, you asshole. I'd probably put it on a good footing right off the butt. Those two don't get along too. In fact, I think there's probably even a worse strain between those two than there is between me and Moat, you know? You think? Well, at least Moat agreed to let us do that keychain thing. The warrior is somebody says, okay, you got that? The warriors. Now let me ask you, how come you're fencing me all of these? Why not? What could you just read it? I could, but who the hell wants to hear me talk? That's a good point. Like I said, keep fencing him. Otherwise, that one guy would call it. Was that yesterday? That was yesterday. It was ready. It was sucking Carlisce's ass. Unfortunately, he agreed with everyone else. Five, six out. He was back. I was uncarliced as to. That's a boy, popular ass. Like that one, don't we got it? She was getting pretty crowded back then. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on a AT&T, and Verizon, that's that Kizzi Crazyman bit. Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale, hello. Uncle Meal. Yes, man. Hi, how you doing? Good. I've got one movie for your poll. Just one. Okay. And I'm really surprised that nobody's mentioned this before. All right. The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Oh, yeah, Pat. Something like that was just on a, a few days ago. And there are people who have gone to that. Every Saturday night. Right. Like a church meeting for years. There are, there are the record in America who watched the Rocky Horror Picture Show more times than they watched the nightly news. Right. And if they're on a tour, you know, I think there are a lot of people who look for that. And they're one of them. They have got people. Thanks a lot. Have a great day. And I love the Dutch packing. That's great. Thanks. You're good weekend. You too. What's this movie? I guess I'll keep you. Instructions were precise. To the north. Your pan's greatest torpedo plant. To the south. Steel and arms were located in the heart of the city. The bomb was aimed midway between the two plants to cause greatest possible damage. Because the plants were located in a valley. Around me. Yeah, but you're not getting that good stuff down there. No, sir. While on that channel, we're still in the city. And that's why I'm on that channel. We see we for madness. And what's that other one? Oh, that the the effort. I told you. Every now and then you see the video from that. And then see original one. I mean, it's the god of the voice. Lots of work came from. How do you like that? You're not going to see it there. Charfer, scoffing uses in previous exercises. There's a little one to rage. Lots of control. Oh, nasty. Have you ever seen another way? I don't want to go into it. There's Robert Duel. Dr. Engels, much to hear. What? He's been. So doing it, he sees the tango and gets hooked on it, which is a different animal to him. Uh-huh. And he gets hooked on the tango. Yes, it's a kind of a connection of the two cities that way. You know, you know. You know, you find it. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Everybody wants to say anything about you. We look for you. This will go from here. To that to the big screen, complete screen with credits. But we're not talking about it. All right. Let's go to one. I didn't like that. Robert Duel, one of the great ones. The unsung heroes of our lifetime. Just love Robert Duel. But the guy was right about the fact. He should have, you know, how would a money, okay? Right. Go to think? Absolutely. He should have been Godfather 2 and 3. Why does everyone have to be a freaking mercenary? Right. Like I said, screw him. Okay. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Good afternoon. And boy, this is my favorite movie. The movie I watched the most. And the movie with the best ending is once upon a time in America, the long version. Right. And the reason why I'm so intrigued by that is because at the end, after Max jumps into the sum truck, it flashes back to noodles in the opium den. And he's smiling. And the question is, is he smiling because he has all the money or is he smiling because he knows that Max is still alive? I think he's smiling because the kishka just thought it out. Now you're right. It's a good point. What? Huh? Yeah. Somebody's kishka's just spilled out. Yeah. I thought that you could see the zits flying from James Woods facing that scene. Right. Yeah. But when they flashed in the onversion, they flashed back. Yeah. No. I understand what you're saying. Just joking. Yeah. If you recall, if you flashed back, the captain, they were kids. Every slow the body. They said they were in the flame. Right. And he goes to the opium den. And then he's smiling. And he's making happy. The question is, did he know that Max was alive? Right. Good question. We'll know he'll answer it. We'll never know the answer. That's like he's watching. Yeah. I didn't see him. Okay. I'll have a great day. Thank you. Once upon a time in America, let me say it again. A really very good movie. Great cast. Robert De Nero. James Woods. You want to touch in Puffas? Remember that? Yeah. Although I think he said Tuckus. You could tell us a boy trying to play a Julian on. Jews don't say Tuckus. Who said that? You said a Tuckus five years to make this freaking movie or something like that. James Woods said that. Well, he's a Jew. James Woods is Jewish. Oh God. Oh, hey, hey. You know, well, see, played. He played the right cone. Speaking of where you are, uh, uh, a dredge packet. 1213 and I see great similarities. There were only right cone. At least was an attorney. 1213 at 560 WQM. A Richard Malon's cave is, uh, where the hell did I have that? I've got some really great story about Richard Malon's cave. A great website. Maybe we'll all do that over the weekend. I'll send along to Beinerboy. We'll put that on there. So people really get the story behind the story of who's pulling the strings and pumping all the money.

She says probably the funny movie I've ever watched and so much better than the original. Austin Power. My smile will be on Jay Leto on Monday night. Telling the world that Toronto is wonderful and safe and that we've been given a raw deal here and everything is... No, no problem. Come on up. Good Canadian boy Mike Myers. Jessie says though I don't like to move, I know you don't like to move. We have seen JFK about 30 times. Not so much for its accuracy before its characters, especially Joe Peshis, the fake eyebrow, neurotic David Ferry. Also, Jared Lito has a small part in a movie American Psycho, with another hunk Christian bail, a definite must see. Merkin Psycho? Is that there's a gestion or they just tell you. No, no, no. I'm not putting on an asking you, was it a good movie? No, I haven't seen it. Yeah, it's pretty good movie. Yeah, that's what you said about whatever that crap was, too. What bully? Bullying, yeah, woolly bully. Never even seen it. Haha. Hahaha. I think it was Jared's done, I didn't think. Right. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. I mean, this is a very scientific thing. When we get that what is pull on Monday, we want to make damn sure that it's right on a money. Here's the call from Daniel. Hi, Hory. Great. I have a list of a bunch of them, but I'm going to have to go with pulp fiction. Okay. You don't like pulp fiction? I don't have to like it for it to be on the list. Okay, can it be on the list? It's on the list right now. Okay, wonderful. Thanks. Have a good day. See, she's upset because I didn't like it. See, it just because I mean, you might not like score spikes. Carlos don't like it. He don't like chocolate. Haha. That means more for me. I see. I don't understand that. I know that everybody's got different tastes, but I get for the life of me. How can anybody not like chocolate? That's the first I've never met anyone. Can we have a herd of anything like that? Nope. I just can't even envision that I can't imagine. I only wish that it was me. I thought that was a universal tie that I wish I didn't like anything sweet and I didn't like pasta. Or any kind of a ten-in-food like pizza. If I didn't like any of that stuff, you have how many pounds that way? About 30 minutes? Topps. Soking wet. See, I'm working with all of it. You're what? I'm more evolved than the next step in the human evolution. He's immune to what he's trying to say. Mm-hmm. Immuten to legal alien, which is a special category. 560, 060, 0560, 060 on the AT&T, and then right up in Webfoot Drive Foot policy. For them. Yeah. No, in his case it's the wet-back drive-back policy. Or in when the duck gets old, amidst the old bear-back policy. We just got a call from a friend of yours that agrees with me. That he doesn't like chocolate either. Moses. Yeah. So there's two of us mutants. Yeah, but there's one big difference. He looks good. He can afford to like whatever he wants. Okay? In your case, your options are very limited. Here's Volca, hello. Yeah, I need a lot of hope sound now, but I got a movie, but I'd like to comment on that editorial, I found out it's all there you're ready to want. Which one is that? Yeah, no. That button isn't being a call. Can you hear me? Yeah, you're breaking up a little bit, which one? Yeah, I can't hear anything. Can't hear anything. Can't hear anything. Call me back or come back to town. Can you understand what you're saying? The coward article was what he was talking about. Yeah, but I couldn't hear what he was saying. Can you? Nope. Oh. Five, six, seven, and now somebody's going to say, See, he'd want to disagree. I don't know whether he agreed or disagree. I don't know what he wanted to say, but I couldn't, I can't leave it on here. Get a real phone pal, get one of worse like more than 10 miles. About. Here's the North Miami, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Well, I got a, my favorite movie about time I've seen it about 30 times. Yeah. All human jokes, can I do a strawberry mart and cool hand look? Cool hand look was really. That's a great movie. Okay, you got all right. Thanks. See you. Cool hand look on the list. Do we have a rocky horror picture show on her yet? I don't see it. I don't know what's in the middle of one of Eric's lunches right now, but I don't see it to you. No. Did you pass it along, Vener? Yes, sir. That one in the whole bunch of others. The other probably, also you might mention him. The blue brother still isn't a pastor. If you don't want to leave it like that all week and long because people start and they can all kinds of cracks about you and Eric all weekend. And for days and months to come. Let's get the a pastor. If you out of the blues brothers. How do you put it in a pastor? If you in the blues brothers. Carlos. My bet. How do you do such an idiotic? It'll literally think. Probably to be able to look at them and pictures of Aaron to get it right. See how many months has he been working on this show and it's already starting to rub off. And see that it's because he's Cuban. I think probably the latter. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I'll see at least he can say here's a good looking guy without getting all up tight about it. All right, you know, concerned. Although he didn't put in gigantic letters about his head or sexuality. He lunges letters. And you know something I think in your case is probably a good thing. Here's Albert's towel. Hello. Hey, how you doing Neil? Pretty good sir. And a movie like the lady said the Rocky Horror Woodstock was the one I seen the most because Oh really? The night movies were a buck and back then there was no music video so you could see people performing in it. I've seen it probably about 90 times. And had to be still there pretend to watch this. I'm sorry. Right. Right. This week since you were talking about movies you brought something to my mind because you always talk about network, life, and mutating art. There's another movie like that being there. If that's not frigging, chancey garden in the White House, I'll kiss your pimple if that is. Okay. Later, Neil. Thank you. I don't have a pimple yes. Yes, not pimple. Not yet. I'll wait a minute. Oh. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. It's got like a pimple. 5, 6, the only thing it was a scores bit on a way out. Hmm. God. Why do I do that? I apologize for doing that because now a whole bunch of people and then they'll blame me. Remember when I was talking about smarties? Hmm. Smarties are okay. They're like a sweeter M&M. They're better than M&M's. But these things make smarties and M&M's taste like dog crap. Okay. Wow. Now I wouldn't know firsthand, you know, but from those people who have had dog crap. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 6, the only AT&T and Verizon line. Here's for a lot of Dale. Hello. Neil, what's going on? Yes sir. Moving on seeing 20,000 times, Willie Watt and the top of the factory. Willie Watt is chopper factor. You don't see that with Carlos listen. Are you serious? One for you with your lover boy Johnny Depp. Nightmare on L Street. We are love that. I love it. Okay. Thanks. Hey Johnny Depp hits the ceiling. Squared Square net movie with blood unfortunately. You saw it, right? Sure. Nightmare on L Street par one. It was okay. I don't think I'd ever watch it again. Especially now I haven't seen Donnie Brasko. I got my Johnny Depp fixed from Donnie Brasko. That was a really good movie. Even though we had like almost no calls about it. That's okay. Nobody went out and saw happening. We get a car or a facie about that. Although they must be on a Virgil Watson because all the copies have been gobbled right. He says they're talking about it. Here's what it says. There are a lot of movies I've seen a lot of times. But the one that I've seen even more than Godfather is Casablica. Do you must remember this? Let's hear our duff singing at huh? That's the only way. Ah, quiet. They think you really care. But myself I can't see. Duff, good luck this instant. I know it's only make beleons. Forduff. Pouring it right I'm gonna appreciate it though. I wanna know only prayer. Oh! Is that someday you care? I hope my dreams come true. Roll it in only you. Oh! No! No! No! How much shall I be so? Okay, let's see now. Poor duff. Poor unappreciated duff. He's so desperately looking to fight his real niche in life. He's just doing it around right now. Okay, so you have a notice? Yeah. Can we put his kiss of like on there? We did not. You must dreamer. Also I never heard of you saying, I forgot for the one over God for the two we liked to come on. Yes, I do like to combine the trilogy's no matter fact. Godfather one is far, I don't care what anybody says. Godfather one is far superior to Godfather two. Except of course for the Myra Lansky business, the highman Rothpart. That was good. The hotels here are empty. I mean. Now things are coming back. That's a good news for Toronto. It's coming back baby. Oh, we're SARS free pretty much.

Yeah, just hell The rear door of a Russian-built cargo plane burst open Is the aircraft carried police officials and the relatives across Congo And a hundred twenty nine passengers were sucked out That sucks The fence minister, Oro'n'Awam, confirmed there was a technical problem What a plane's rear door, if they provided no details Did not confirm any debts among the two hundred people on board This is what I don't understand After the accident occurred some forty five minutes into the flight The palace managed to turn back and land a plane in Kinshasha The plane with its rear door missing could be seen on the airport's tarmac Two officials at the OIC, two officials in the International Airport in Kino's capital Kinshasha independently told the Associated Press that a hundred and twenty nine people were feared dead Nine survivors were being treated for minor injuries in psychological trauma How is it possible that nine people could survive getting sucked out of a plane? I mean if it's forty five minutes into the flight, those are the ones that weren't sucked out Are you sure? I'm pretty sure. Are you sure? It says a hundred and twenty nine passengers were sucked out A hundred twenty nine people were feared dead So we have to assume the nine survivors are the ones who weren't sucked out And that what you just said? That's what you said.

Why do you ever think about singing for your supper, haven't you? That's where that song came from. Seriously, isn't there any kind of real candy like beside chocolate? There's like, help me out here. What other, like, those slices, those fruit slices, then butter scotch. Right. Okay. I like those jelly-y. Yeah. Jelly-y is long as there's no chocolate. Right. Jelly-y is scar bits will turn you loose, baby. If you want a new edition, if you haven't, don't go blind to me because I'm morning you. I'm put like a little astrus guy and a adult warning on this. If you're one of those people, the addictive problems, like all of us, do not start. God, they're good. Hmm. I gotta get that thing out of the garbage you. This is almost as good as farting in the shower. You don't know how to steam each shower? Almost. Let's see, Todd and Hollywood says, speaking of the taste of dog crap, the second most ultimate midnight movie is Pink Flamingos with Divine. But that's not his choice for the list. His choice is, it's a mad mad world because it came out when he was a kid's in the movie. He's been released 30 times. Also, it says, P.S. It's obvious to me why Joe Costello sucks now. He got married. Every married guy knows an effing idiot, including me says, Todd and Hollywood. See? That's what happened to Port Joe. He's been pretty good. Not great, but he was coming along. And now he got married and his whole act has gotten. And you warned him. Did he all warn? I tried. Oh, yeah. And you know what? It's not too late for Miguel. I keep warning him. I was he gunna get married to that, uh, fine young lady. Yeah. It's too late. No, it's not. What do you mean by that? Well, they're engaged. Go get him off. Go, they're engaged in a pee. It doesn't go follow through then she will cut him off. Well, yeah, we'll see. Here's my thing. What does a guy like him have to worry about being cut off by some broad. I mean, she may be very, very nice, but he can get pretty much whatever he wants. Right. What if she cuts it off? Well, there you go. Here's the Fashimwally in Brower who says, I'd like to respond to the Fashimwally for claimed catch 22 to be a great movie. Catch 22 is a perfect example of great novels that don't translate to the screen. And I will say this 99 times out of 100, the book is better than the movie, including Godfather. Joseph Haller wrote Catch 22 and arguably is one of the great modern American novels, suck this movie. Way too complex to capture how his message, thankfully no one made how his second novel something happened to a screenplay. Talk about your one-hit wonders. It says, I've re-read Catch 22 numerous times over the years. Maybe that's a future pool. No. Now, while he then comes back to a senses, he says, no, then they ought to have to read books. He wants to nominate Song of the South. Song of the South for the pool. How do you like that? I snore. Keep that blueboard out of here, Wally. And, John and North Miami Beach. Did you read this thing? Did I? About the censored bits in the CD. The answer to John is, to make a long story short. No. Can we be intimidated? Are we been putting our place? Yes. We need to work. What's some of this other stuff we can? Whatever. This John and North Miami Beach has got three on here. The warriors. Did we put that on there already? Yes. Yes. That's on there. Greece and murder by death. Let's put murder by death because Greece is John Revoltah. And even if he has seen it a whole bunch of times, who else is in Greece? Olivia, new Tron Bomb. Oh, Olivia is new Tron Bomb? Oh. Do you know if she was very Demantla pansy? I guess you do know that. Right. Oh, now there is a movie I've seen several times. That's in a running with Godfather. My tutor. Okay. It's a cutesy movie. And Matt Latansy looks real good. And so there's Watson and whoever they plays the tutor. Yeah. Do you know that movie? I know what. I do. It's a youth tutor. Yeah. I'm sure you would. And of course he's run a night like mostly Nick and most of the movie. Matt Latan. What ever happened to him? H. Very Matt. Olivia Newton, John. Oh, Jesus. You know, I really do need to read this. Speaking of that. Nick, Chris, does article in the New York Times today. No time to get squeamish. At least part of it. Because it should give you an idea of just how and I'm not exaggerating. It's getting more and more frightening by the day. And if people would just open up their eyes and ears and listen and do a little reading of their own, as opposed to like reading the two crap fish wrappers down there, they'd be starting to get pretty nervous too. He says most aid scientists are terrified these days. They described which hens by neo-puretons in and out of the Bush administration. And many are so nervous that an email and research abstracts the avoid using words like gaze, homosexuals, anal sex or sex workers. So scientists at the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere are devising their own secret code. I won't give it away, but one term stands for gay or homosexual, another for anal sex and so on. I would recommend avoiding all electronic communication to any NIH office, one scientist born in one of many emails, notes buzzing among AIDS researchers. Phone communication does not appear tapped at this time. Even so, I'm advising staff to speak in code unless an NIH staff member indicates you can speak freely. In short, assume you're living in Stalinist Russia when communicating with the US government. As my Times colleague, Eric Ericka Goodnode, in breaking the story last month, researchers have been told by NIH project officers to avoid sensitive language in grant applications. A university at California Researcher, for example, was told to cleanse the extract of his grant proposal of words like gay, homosexual, and transgender. Since his research was on HIV and gay men, this was a challenge. How can scholars investigate how AIDS spreads without using words that make a religious right blush? Perhaps this seems like an obscure issue, it's not. The fundamental question is whether elements of the Bush administration are politicizing science, using budgets advisory committees in the fear of embarrassment to chill the way that science is conducted in America. And it goes on. In fact, there are one more sentence. If I can, can I do it? Please. He says, especially in the case of AIDS, which kills more people in two hours than SARS has killed in total, that numbers of human lives are worth stake in America alone, 12,000 people by every year of AIDS, the difference between solid scientific research and pseudo science will be measured in millions of lives saved. There you go. Yeah, the careful award you say because we don't want to alienate the Christian right, they're very sensitive and touch you, et cetera. It's still killing mostly targets, right?
