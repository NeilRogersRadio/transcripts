Anyway, good morning Neil. Your boy Dave Gurgs, huh? Yeah, he's a great guy, but every time I walk in there his face turns blue. There's Gurgly my steering. He does not much I can put away food and booze. Well, I'm gonna change my name to Neil Gurgly. Hey, that would work. I love that name. Hey, I'm a Gurgly man. Only I'm a sports station. Can you have some of my name Gurgly? Hey, did you hear about the Boston Sports Fighter that came out yesterday? Did I buy that? I don't say everywhere. I have the story right here, man. I could say you're not around here. I can't get your time ready, but I can get you him. No thanks. No. Old and ugly. What else is his name? Edda something? Yeah, I have with a story I had it on there. Ed Gring. Ed Gring. Rimes with gay. Yeah. I got it right here, but I read that. Listen to what's he so mad about? He thinks everybody's a homophob and everybody's out to get him or something. He's listening to your show a lot. Yeah. Well, then he's saying anyway, we have a real dilemma today. We're gonna take a preliminary pull on it because Mo is like going to such great lunch not or reach out. He's like extending the hand, the gland, their friendship to us. I don't know because it's almost like too much too soon. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. It's tough for me. I think it's because you've turned out I'm so much. I think he's like reaching out. The last person he can look at. He can't be farming. It's simple. I see him every day and you don't have to. Right. So I've done everything I can to be cool to this guy. I've known him for years. I've told you many times that I can't force him to be cool. I can't force him to not be the way he is. I mean, everybody knows how he is. Well, what is the way he is? I'm going to try this way. You love for me to start saying stuff. The bottom line is that let's just take it from your people skin. Yeah. Then he's good at it. And you know what? Doesn't face me one way or the other. Go to John Holmes. You got under people skin. Speak of big D's. Yeah. No, I think I think his lab has more than it. What's his name? What's his name? That's playing John Holmes in this movie? Uh, what's his name? For a. Anyway, the uh, seriously, what the hell is uh, you know how to even know what you're talking about? The John Holmes movie. I know there was a new part of the movie. He was. He played in, he played Batman. You know, the guy played Jim Morrison and the doors movie. No, about. Come on. Come on. That's right. He, he plays him and I like him and Salton C. I saw yesterday on a region. And he looked like Jesus. He was fat with a beard. I saw John Holmes. I told a little clip of John Holmes thinking from the, uh, from the crotch up. He looked just like him. Do you know what's your about the, He didn't come. Come on. He's good looking. No, I don't know. He's gross. I thought he was great in Salton C as well. I heard covered crank at him. Oh, problem. He saw yours man. Go for it. Well, listen, I don't know that way, but I can tell you that. Especially my favorite. Back down at John Holmes model. Maybe he's got something really surprising for you. Yeah, you know, I should get my girlfriend. John Holmes model and strap that on the end of my missile. I bet. No, no. I think that maybe you're like looking for the old. Oh, I forgot to play bend over yesterday. That's what I heard loosely. Let me just say this lastly to you. I know that we talked yesterday about Danny Heathley, wrecking the car. Now you were like, uh, he was drunk. Dude, there's no doubt. And they're going to cover up his blood out on. That's for five weeks. That's the dumbest they ever. And then they didn't know anything about Buckhead. No, they were out drinking. It was two in the morning. They're driving a Ferrari nine a mile an hour. Yeah. Is that that limited amounts of alcohol on a pretty old. It's a bunch of bullcraft. You're been a snider or whatever the kid's name. We'll see other kids name. He's brain dead. Now he's in a coma. Is he really brain dead? He's in a coma. Oh, my. But they're saying that, uh, you know, I guess today's that you're vengeance on the trash. No, it is. I love the trashers. I want them to win. But you can't win me because they were out of two in a morning. Drunk driving a Ferrari nine a mile an hour. Now the estate scenario did you work for the team? I work for the Turner Sports with Joan and the team. They don't own them anymore. They sell them for that. This is this is for else vengeance on the team. You're high. And Rob's that Danny Heathley dies. My vengeance was simple. I mean, he explained it so you can clear this up. Yeah. I got paid for four years. I worked for one. There's your vengeance. I cut a nice deal. Neil, you know, I'm not stupid. I can all relate to it. That's a deal. The OK from Paxon. That isn't. It's like your deal. The work is crazy. Um, the Humper has got the best deal. This how Hank is like off every day. It's off the whole week long. And none of it is vacation time. Ever. I like him. So he's got a set one I asked him for out in John Vegas. And he said he just couldn't get him. Yeah. I love the hammer though. He's, he's the guy. You know, you keep saying that went the hour job. I really, rather do after news. Who the hell wants to talk sports in the free morning? Job is at it. Yeah. Who's job you really want? Let's put it right up there in the table. Why? I think if I was on the four-negames, I'd make the station a lot more money than talking about him in the morning. Yeah. I think people that talks sports in the morning are depressing. I think people that talk about him right before the game are right after make money. Uh-huh. Why did this indicate it show? And I was just on the same thing. I was on the right out. I was happy to be met. I was in John's tickets. See. Yeah. OK. Have a nice day Neil. Ha ha ha ha. I'll see ya. Hello, I'm the General Manager of his radio station. And today is Russia, Shana, the Jewish New Year. In an effort to celebrate religious diversity and promote goodwill towards other faiths, we've brought in a member of the Jewish community to offer our Jewish listeners a greeting for the new year. Hey. Happy New Year. Hey. Hey. Hey, chick. Go home. Okay. I always been General Long. The other night. I went down into the home. I went back to white. I brought on a fashion of peasants. Before I realized, I get a piling cake. I'm in wheat market. No, counter-rank. I'm a counter-rank. So it's a looser ball than seed. I got a bag. Counter-faceted disease. I had sold a beggar. I got my finger up there. My fingers are clogged. I'm all that have reached in the super assortment. I have to die for it. I die to rest. That's why I wear a beggar bail. I give the rule for both hands. I die to rest. I got to die for it. The knife is on how when I lose control. You can hear the quote. When I strike my whole heart, I scream. I'm a little boy and father. Under the flat, for my school. Out from my plan, my parents and trips. You're the only one who gave me a tip. You're the only one who gave me a tip. You're the only one who gave me a tip. No! I'm the only one who took my whole life. I'm the only one who gave me a tip. The pain was rubbing as my whole toy flew. See, there was only one thing I could do. My ass kicked into the piece of my poop. And I grew the pieces to kiss his teeth. And then I got the knife on my right. I gave the knife to my ass. I put a pillow on the back. And now I feel so warm. You're my mama made it for more areas. She's like so much children. Oh, shit. 10,07, at 5,60 WQA. I'm happy Wednesday too. It's our big Wednesday extravaganza. We got that gigantic one and two hour. Which will really be good because it can be a chance to watch some of the Anky twins games. The Anky's go down. Like I told you, Scott, they're going down. Down, down, down, down, down. And not in the middle of the hills either. It's a beautiful thing. And then of course you can hear the gasping choking sounds from Atlanta. Can't you hear them? I can't. Same ones that you hear just about every year at this time. Choking, squeezing, crap, and they're done. They'll be out. I think the cups will be them in three straight now. So we got the twins in the Yankees. They want to clock, which won't be on the air. But I'll be watching it. We'll do like a little play by playing in like this. Marlon San dector follows the mad dog. Another short show for the mad dog. And no show for the Humper. Always watch on. You put a seal, man. Or I'm in a wrong time slot. You know what? I'll just start looking at these schedules. The beginning of the season and then figure out what time we want to be on. You know the Yankees game tomorrow. Oh, it's not today? No, they have a day off. What kind of a schedule is that? We got the A's in the Red Sox today. But that's not until 10 o'clock tonight. Well, that's the way it is. Oh, Jesus. Mad dog 2 to 3 30. Marlon San de 3 30. Marlon's and the Giants in Frisco again 406. It's a must win because they don't win this one. It's basically over right when you agree with that. Yes. Uh, 10th inning play off special. Woodland, Casper and Tommy Hutton at the 730 comes at the Braves. And like I said, you can hear those gurgly sounds from Atlanta at a 30 night at a key follows the game. Joe Mark overnight and Joe Costello's going to be out in our QM van tomorrow noon 2. Oh, I got an explanation on that whole thing. And what's that? But the noon till whatever thing. They're only required to be there or whatever for now or but Miguel said. Here's the deal. And I think it's a good idea. Well, let me be required. Whatever. Whatever. They're just way to minute. So if they don't make five hundred, they don't have to stay there. The whole two hours if it turns out to be a lame location, they can pick up and go somewhere else. Right for about five minutes for work. I got a little lower hour every few minutes if there isn't like a whole bunch of people are they'll just pick up and go someplace else. Now we'll put it on the ear and then by the time anybody gets there, they'll be one other place. That sounds good. Okay. They can keep chasing the van around. Yeah, just keep. Well, you remember how like in previous years they would go to a location. We thought it would be a good location and it turned out to be a dud and they were like stuck there. So right away he's not going to be stuck. And those days it would be like they would start like a ten third year, eleven o'clock in the morning. And we had like generally during the entire show. Now it's a different start when you start at noon. There's not like really time to regroup and pick up and go to a second place. I don't think. I don't think so. Well, Miguel, I was way ahead of this morning. Say if he does 500 dollars in the first hour, he'll stay another hour. Well, buddy, me and on his way out of here this morning, he's not doing anything today. No, just way out of the studio. Yeah. If he does 500 dollars the first hour, he'll stay another hour. Well, what kind of a deal is that? So what if he does like for 60? Well, come on. We're not going to split hairs. Not seriously. If he does 400 the first hour, like maybe people are whole bunch of people on a way They'd be given them for the second hour. And he might have another 600 to second hour and he's going to leave because he didn't do 500. What kind of a deal is that? To get a deal is that. Just a good. Listen, it's kind of like we're jerking as difficult as it is to raise money for charity this year. This is going to be one of the toughest years in a long time. To be jerking the public or wildlife hands saying, well, we'll be there from noon to two if you show up. And if not, like when you get there, I'll probably be gone. Well, once he got going, he can do Doreen before noon, okay? Two or three times with his potent tapiness. He can do it two or three times. Jesus. Reef or laying gasping for oxygen right there on a goddamn promotion room floor and then head on out there And then go do something productive for a couple of hours. Take a little breather. Take our respite from that bitch. Right? Yeah, sure. No, when you be porked off, if you set up like 20 till two if you drove from like homestead, I'll know where we're not going to say what's going on on the year. Yeah. Well, suppose you drove all the way from homestead in like two minutes before you got there, I came on a year It said, oh, well, wasn't too good. So Miguel Tocache. Sure. Because he's alive all the way from homestead. Right? Or whatever it had you came from. Not all of our audiences in Pompano Beach. Thank God. We got a few people under the age of 100.

Teller try some deputy do I'll be back with some final thoughts after this oh S.A. 33 at five sixty WQM happy Wednesday to you See I thought when for I was talking about dance nighter there being in a coma Where he said it sounded like he was on a verge of dying Not being in a coma series. They're not good, but the article here from the Atlanta urinal constitution says he remains in a coma this morning but doctors said test so far rule out serious brain damage His cats can look fairly good said doctors son J. Gupta. Oh, oh good luck Dan Gupta from C&N that asshole an neurosurgeon who operated on started referring to computer brain imaging It didn't show any significant bleeding. He said he also suffered max celebration desoloration which results when I had a suddenly Whipped forward and backward Gupta said he was having to take some pressure off. That is brain during surgery and the coma was partially induced by anesthesia So there you go that's a deal. He's he's in a coma, but he's that doing just fine. I guess I don't know it's not brain dead. He's not brain dead Speaking of mo and here's our appool the first pull today and the reason I'm doing this is because I'm getting all these fiery ports I couldn't hear mo show this morning because some asshole had the pot turned up and I couldn't hear the audio from the station this morning for some strange reason Somebody was dicken with stuff what happened? Are just before 10 o'clock by the way Scott was that in the other room? I have no idea everything. Why is it good here? Why I couldn't hear the audio? Yeah, I had to be from the other room I think it's that Dan the Robert again. He's probably not a lot of stress because he didn't buy anything for our young kippur Like I said yesterday. I'm glad I'm not the only asshole around here. No, no. Oh, you got a lot of company You fit in like a rubber glove should kneel at set know how we David is overtures of peace and love He's really been sucking up to me big time.

Oh, just kill you So here's our first poll today should Neil accept how our David is overtures of peace and love I mean this keeping keeping in mind when you cast your vote on the hills of him desperately trying to get Georgia's ass can try to interfere with his show and try to make me into a racist like Rush Limbo Which would get to that story and all this other stuff trying to do everything is power to sand daggers Just because of the fact we talked about his trickered pants and pastie s-wig and the fact is show suck So in any rate, you know, we've had this year and a half now real Hostility and deep seated heat And now all of a sudden just out of nowhere.

I jerk this So anyway the Irish Limbaugh thing you did see that I'm sure about ESPN where he made the comments about Donovan McNab no I didn't see it on a George's favorite quarterback Donovan McNab's been a three straight pro bulls took consecutive NFC championship games him as the finalist for the NFL MVP Wardest first will see to his starter still commentator rush Hermon curing Limbaugh questions his credentials Deformic Nabla the equals to a 22th their 2313 when over to bills Limbaugh said on ESPN study NFL count on the McNab is overrated the comment contained racial overtones It's at off controversy a seat most other guys have been fired for things like that who've been like in the you know like Jimmy to geek right and People like that outcamp panes with the Dodgers. I don't think that that he's been that good from the get-go Limbaugh said I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well There's a little hope invested in McNab and he's got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn't deserve the defense Curried this team ESPN spokesman said yesterday that Limbaugh doesn't do interviews added that he didn't take the comments were racially biased It was comparing McNab's performance on the field was reputation and immediate spokesman Dave Nagel said Nagel said that with Limbaugh on the show this season ratings for Sunday NFL count on our up 10% overall and up 26% among the 18 to 34 male demographic Which shows you there is absolutely no hope for America ESPN hired Limbaugh for his passion is ability to express opinions sparked the bit as a football fan Nagel said In just one month he certainly has delivered So basically what he said is this sports a ain't so good, but everybody says he is because he's a he's a guard dark skin Not a bit McNam, how do you like that? And probably down of in votes a Democratic too, so Russia hates him like poison 20 to 11 at 5 60 don't forget we have to official Marlon's watch party again Did they hopefully with the better result in yesterday?

total handle last season I guess what's no more five across on a long shot my good close personal friend general manager dick five or said we realize the show majoring is a tradition horse racing but we think it's a sucker back for our patrons it's not worth risking two dollars for an incentive in payoff that's the norm I believe it drives away the novice or first time player thinks they make an lowest wager and are disappointed when they pay off as a few cents more than their investment we also see see my first bet in the game was two thousand sixty cents I bet two bucks to show how we're totally the same many times i'll do a janko here comes down maclomerate the nine horse he wins the race sixty cent we also see domination show waiting is way to boost bets on our win and place pools

three thirty to sapphnoon now who's pitching for tomorrow is today uh... scott bread penny oh pennies for rumour so bread pays pigeon i see i don't understand why did they pitch done trial on sundae on a closing day of the season why did they do that instead of saving them for like one piece first two games out there but they they want everybody gets sufficient rest and they want you to pitch at a rotation not good well bright penny might just turn out to be uh... the he might be the answer they maybe it's like a two hitter and the marlins are one like four nothing is happening on the coast penny had outstanding stuff is last game out outstanding i thought it's important intensive here okay yes you start a sound like that last night i was given a hot media trying anyway shoelace day two

sixty nine votes on our first poll today should neal accept more how our dividends over to your piece of love absolutely not we hate more fifty five we hate them we absolutely absolute hate them only if neal has no suffering spec thirty six she i have to take that very serious the under consideration cut only if most paints is vault spot thirty five that's what i voted yes we need to harm in it qm only twenty six fifteen percent not too strong and who's more how our dividend a full ten percent seventeen people say who does who that not a five-day can we can get professional painters to come in if he chooses that option because you have to admit that he really is a strenuously uh... extended the hand of friendship i mean he's sticking out there he's probing his reach it around his uh... moving it all over the place right right i mean when he's stuck right out there in the theorem you must have been a guest here's the money be chill yes one on the other yes sir yes thanks you just to comment real quick on the uh... elimination of the show betting in pomp and all that may be due to the rounding factor i think that the minimum payment on the on a ticket on a two dollar ticket has to be two dollars in ten cents yeah and on the show that's a they made uh... after the races one they made to the mathematics and find out that each of those people should get maybe two dollars in five cents so the track has to pitch in a nickel on every day that that's very very rare that's only if there's an enormous amount of you have a bridge jumper that fits like ten grand in the show for some like that happens only once in a blue moon very rare but i i still wonder that it might have something to do with the rounding factor i mean you know you figure that the more types of tickets they can sell the better and if it is only one point four percent of their handles still that's one point four percent see i don't like it because there are our people and by every now and i'll bet like uh... on a long shot five bucks across the border whatever ten bucks across and of course pay for example five forty show because it's a long shot and maybe the favorites off the board and you get like say five eighty show just a big example you lost a book on the whole thing you know so uh... it's it's a good bet that's true it offsets the other bats and yes you really may not have a good feel for it you may not be that interest right but you want to make a bet to have a some interest in the racely make a show that you know and i i don't i guess we can't do anything about it but it's that to see that they made that sort of a while i have an agree i mean you know pomp and a park and pector spots coming up in a minute and a good friends of mine but i just disagree with a monocir think a showbiting should be allowed uh... the tradition is there for zillion years you know i think so to win play show across and it did in addition to which the track is got the paraga to be the winner of five horse field for example or if there's a stupidest favorite in a race like one and i track they can eliminate showbiting and any race that they want to yes that's true on a race by race that's true i have thought about that point that's a good one you know they can do it if it works and they do they and they do do do do it yeah okay thanks pal right i'm with you yeah i don't like it thick i know dick fibers probably is there right now and swearing that's not a bit he's not saying i've been just a little he might be i mean if i want to bet two bucks and Donald breeder to show it might pay fifty bucks to show if he ever hits the board hey don't let's this way over turn the middle of the track now way out there by the grandstand come on donning hit him again just tip him again they're like uh... a little contain the tip him again five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighty see i have forgotten that this is you holiday thing rushing shun all the way through a young

but which is a social issue it's a media issue and has nothing to do with a game itself other than the fact that the guy happens to play the game in the mobile happens to be on a show that's associated with a pregame and this guy wants to hop me up on a run a ball forty five ten one up your ass okay pal you and Ricky Williams i'm sorry five five six seven five sixty when you can't make

host hemorrhoid suffer folks over three other pounds i know the agave of this kind of dilemma ladies and gentlemen i'm here to tell you there's help with new preparation rush and my rush to excellent suppositories now you can end the pain and it's ring of hemorrhoid will teach you just for my picture on the box of suppositories and the applicator to back them another fine products from all i b the obesity in broad castling of work speaking up in the ass is my close friend dick find word from pompotopark how did i know you'd be calling all that's a great segue ever see the two of them together no rest my case i want first i want to enter your uh uh your question from before the break uh audio stick Jim Dennis did be the uh a b bread hammer couple did i say that i knew you yet you did in the horse you were you were you were you're you're you're you're you're i could have told you was audio stick what was the crisp boring horse true delay true dwein can be bread man over a hollywood mark in the clattic at the only rate to bread hand over finished worse than second in his career and a reason i think that happened is it was one of those races that they tried a race in from behind which wasn't his style of racing he liked to race on the front break urban change the boy for some reason he changed the vital he wasn't yeah it's like his breakfast last race and he either he went from uh our open bridal and put blinder sonum and uh he couldn't hold him and he went like he went to record he went a pile and record time the problem was the race was a mile and a 16 yeah he got tired at the end he had one of frankham syndrome yeah yeah exactly very good but that i know i did call all put it to defend myself a little bit all right hey listen i'm not all bent out of shape about it i just now do a great with a guy to call before that old cockett was complaining about the show betting i happen to like uh you know if you've got a 15 to one shot or 20 to one shot or real good long shot and it's worth taking a shot at it and you bet like five bucks across the board on it you can make some serious cash on it it becomes in and it becomes in third if it actually hits the board you might actually make a couple of that's true um i've got a couple of things that that uh weren't mentioned one is that with our with our field size which averages a little over eight horses are ready the value is really diminished the tracks that have ten horses or ten starters more or eight i think there's still plenty of value in the show school and the issue of the mine of school is is important to us because the way we're too floored a lot of out of state tracks and uh shop are uneasy taking our signal because if a bridge jump or comes in to their place it makes the bet they get stuck with making up the uh the different the nickel on the dollar and it's not like that in in other states so we think it's going to help us dollar signal uh a little more uh outside the state but i know it's it's going to be controversial one of the reasons we did it was uh you know to do something a little crazy get people talking about us i think that's worth already and uh you know we'll see uh we'll see how it plays uh the thing that bothers me you better not want to have the show at twenty to one yeah if it finishes thirty you get all excited the two favors happen around one two and you get a you get a pay off of two dollars and sixty cents or even worse that twenty to one shall win the two favors run two three then you see them and you've got to show bet it's going to pay forty two dollars maybe fourteen dollars a place and then two fifty to show you feel like you've been worked over a little bit yeah we're gonna have to wonder five shot finishes off the board in a page like uh forty bucks to win sixteen bucks to place and thirty five bucks to show because the wonder five shots off the board made a break that's right well you know you can still uh that's why they call it horse racing you'll still be able to bet make show bet on the other fifteen or twenty tracks we bring you bring you you know it's not like you can't make it show bet you know so it's not the show better is what you're really trying to say is you try to pay me into a quarter what a pussy try to trap that show money this guy is you know well I mean it is only one point four percent of our handle so yeah we you know we think we can make more more by selling the signal to more about that is safe what they can shot be how it works and uh we get people to talk about it but the Johnson said we got a shot that's right and uh and uh and the rush things you know uh he started to get popular when he was right across the street from the insect or mental or the station called KFCK right across from the barn area where you get smell all the horse poop and uh he just used to come over to the races and uh uh on fourth of July and you like with uh you know be the BDMC for the firework show but that was you know that was that was the beginning of it for him he was that was eating all of Kebler cookies from the Kebler that could be but he was that he I mean he was like a 200 yards from uh from my office that's where that's where he brought cats and you know that's for all but that stuff uh you know that's where he uh he got his uh he got his uh a poppin uh I'll be damned and got yeah well bad day there was probably okay that's so we can not only can we blame you for uh eliminating the show but he got poppin a park we can blame you for a given rush limba his start that's right we gave him a leg off that they say in the horse race yeah yeah that's um well it wasn't really neat it was uh it was I had no choice over that it was uh uh but the state playgrounds and Sacramento thought he would be a good representative well he was no Steve Lawrence and I'll tell you that no you these certainly was and we'll get Steve back here and hoppin on a couple years so as we get the pop machine he was no gene for landing him wait have a great day Dick we'll see you bye bye oh when I start throwing him names out George just start his in his innerist start doing all kinds of the wild things I'm sorry I didn't hear a word I'm good 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 we're doing a sports show today sounds like it which is you know I want to know why why to hell not we'll do whatever it hell we want it's pretty damn entertaining if you ask me if you ask Dick you'll think of the same thing anyway how's mode doing not good not good we need how many acuems hold a got 15.6 percent our 255 votes absolutely not we

this whole thing that we got going on with a pool today not gonna have any calls about the fact that for well wants the mow's job and Hank's job and everybody else is job on because it is a self-promotermant he's a gogator he wants to spread it out when it out spread it out here's margate hello hi Neil yes sir yeah um i just had an idea um with the internet voting you know how the banks can take your money you know through the bill paying or whatever yeah good night to have an election you know do that the voting through an election type process i'm a internet yeah i mean they can encrypt what about people what about people that don't have computers you know why they go to the polls that what about computer hackers well i mean can't they fix that somehow eventually what about sleepers what about people that'll load up with phony votes like they do on our poll all the time what about those people viruses are worse but what about the old virus in the way and what about the wicked worm huh yeah well couldn't they do like a verification like a pen number i mean they can take your money they can't get a proper vote you know they mean yeah well they're saying now the electronic voting is going to be is even more subject to fixing and the the old thing at least with the balance yet something tangible to count and recount the electronic thing it's just a number of machines somewhere they can they can press a button and make it read whatever number they want I guess yeah i was the thought i thought you know eventually maybe they could do it though it would work well i thought maybe someday when it get to be foolproof and about a hundred years thanks a lot paly good idea but i can happen very difficult to make it happen are we you think we're going to have another honest election in america no in fact look at all the time it's going to say we can still have some entertainment shows on election i'd used to be pretty entertained it's not entertaining no more except of course in 2000 when florida gave america all of that her although the schilke's man when people were taken me locks by the gallon what a show oh he one no he lost though we think we don't know a gem said it's okay to fix his in whatever it had it was and look what we got now huh top had rows of a look what we got eleven twenty seven at five sixty wqm brandy shoes has been around

Which I haven't been watching here, but let me know when he starts speaking and Response to what rush had to say about the him only being counted by the media because he happens to be black And media is trying to invent this successful black quarterback and as we mentioned how many do we mention my third man More in moon to Randall Cunningham to like a whole bunch your very successful Black quarterback and see It's just amazing. I'm almost speechless from this I see the same thing here the same comparison is Baba and the blow jobs and everybody was talking in peace When we had to go through all that I would be business waste those millions of dollars and now we got a president into a Got a single war based on lies and American kids are over there dying every single day Here attached dollars to being flushed out a toilet every single day and other than a couple of people would balls nobody's really seriously talking about in peace But yet It's freaking unbelievable And it's the same thing with a rush thing you know Jimmy DeGeek said this and this one said that there been a whole bunch of guys who've been canned because Everybody I'm the national networks anyway, so I'm thinking I was sensitive it up tight about racial remarks But Rush Limbaugh that fat lion son of a bitch he can go on her say any damn thing he likes hey and awaiting syrup.

I've been the Burton jacks which is now closed But he was saying how great it was and that for some reason he took a shot at New York Prime I'm gonna tell you something that's in Boca. I'm gonna give them a make good because He said that the services bad and they try to rush out of there Maybe they just didn't kiss his inflated ass or something you know I mean some guys were well known they like to go on a restaurant where people fall on over him if they don't get that They get unhappy with the place. I'm gonna tell you something I have been to that place probably a half dozen times. I know a lot of people who go there The restaurants fantastic and I will go out on a lemon. Tell you it's the best steak sauce You can get anywhere south of Peter Loores and anybody who would knock that restaurant Has got the problem the restaurant is not the problem. Yeah, they've been there before together Well, we'll go anytime you want to and you can tell me of our right or wrong. Okay that place is fantastic It's where and you know what it's not that far it's if you lift from here It's less than a 45 minute ride. It's right. It's right and my is not part so he does not say It's better than the other place because I haven't been to the other place. I'm just saying it didn't deserve to get knocked Now, maybe he had a bad experience there. Maybe they didn't want him around that one. You know, it's maybe he was a pain in the S, you know, and they said let's get this guy out of here. I'm serving him. Get him on a road Absolutely, I'm 48. I wonder if we was talking about 12 minutes before noon. Yeah, you know you got an awful lot of fence Many of you do before we all of a sudden just they're saying okay all those for giving please come home We're gonna kiss your balls, but we're gonna like squeeze your bag a little bit and the seabab pops out Got a lot of fence men you do it. I have to be take weeks and months and maybe never But he's given it is a best shot maybe on a week back better to maybe you know that would be good all I don't like food basket all like food a little bit but not a food basket. You ever seen a food basket Yeah, it's not a fact great. Here's a lady in boit and beach hello, cherry Lady and boit and beach Benanas is gone The lady in boit and beach we put around her she was online nine we put her our right off the bat And she was seeing and as soon as she said hello, I hung up Well, I was like it man was one of those things where you can't stop or it was beyond a point in overturned You were committed maybe she stole her hello.

Yes, Neil You were talking about Impeaching bush in the tombeek post the other evening September 29th to the exact They had an article about somebody is selling in pink bush Yeah, well, that's great, but that doesn't to get the job done. Oh, I know. Yeah. Well, how do you get a matter there? Sounds like probably an election next year if they decide we still want to have one Listen, I voted for a McBride up here in Palm Beach five times and it never came out.

You room pastrami for me No, I did not call her and culture did it don't blame me. Okay, okay, I was wounded forever and The fact she's got the cool slaw on all the Yeah, cool slaw and a cheese And believe me that ain't Russian dressing There's another five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on a AT and T and Verizon wireless line Mo was up to 16.3 percent. Yes. We need harmony of QM. He's as you're up there a little bit He's trying his best. Okay. He's making a real honest effort I give him a little credit for that not too much But I do I want to look at this thing openly honestly. I want to have it open mind. Do I? No, huh? Oh, I know George does because George is like he's got him right there. You know like look at him at the race You keep you keep having these encounters It's not what I try to avoid in my head For Not so-and And then all of a sudden there are and some encounters their advances Maybe he's seeking you out maybe when he looked it out in the tube And he was trying to like send you a message. You know like Joey Zanzi sending a message Maybe he was trying to say hey paly take a look at this, okay Well, that old time smokers at a time maybe you'd like to you know Taking a trip up my Hershey highway. He's got a wig there too Here's Evan Chiro. Hello. Hey, no, how you doing? I think it's really steel wool. Yes, sir. I might be your truck Back the first of all with mo I think their mo has become clean. He has to come into your studio and sit on and reveal Wasn't you really trying to get George by it when that he really called? I don't hear he already admitted that to me. I already know that The audience one year right right.

All of a sudden like a new new one came. They just all vanished. 567.0560. Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. Hi, Alia. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Me, oh. Yes. Yes. Yes. I went to a new show. I just heard about that. That ridiculous statement that I rushed to him by me. But you know, he came on. I heard of some other one there. He did tell him to tell him to. We're about that. I mean, what a fool. There's done something like that. I just want to say hello to you. I had told you to show as much as I can when I get a chance to listen. I'm a truck driver. So I don't give you a lot because I've got a time. But every chance I get a tune into you. I enjoy show a lot. You have a good day. You too. Thanks, Prail. I enjoyed as much as I can to. Some days not so much. Well, like today, the phones are kind of like quiet, but then that's where it is because it's the Jew holidays. Oh, see there he goes again. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound. And I guarantee here's my fearless, fearless prediction. Nothing is going to happen to rush. He won't be suspended. He won't be reprimanded. He won't do a goddamn thing. Okay, because that that's just trading stock anyway. Is it the stock in bail on hammer? That's his whole deal. Is line and saying outrageous ridiculous things? And the difference being, he doesn't say him from a comical standpoint. He, he means it. He says it to appeal to that hateful, that archie-bunker mentality, which he's a classic example of, will be a for entertainment. He's a direct. 5, 6, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T of horizon line. They do not call things starts today allegedly. He still got their wires crossed, those as the store and CBS news. Governor official still predicting their largest decline in telemarketing calls to millions of registered phone numbers, but... There's this legal struggle going on back and forth to and fro side by each. 29 states now have their own do not call rules, and North Carolina, Attorney General Roy Cooper says his state's new laws not affected by federal core rulings against the government list. He says, well, be enforcing our state do not call in North Carolina, based on the federal registry, and if they don't like it, they can jam it up there, lily white ass, they didn't say it. 5, 6, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T. And Verizon Wireless line. Here's a call from Tamarack, hello. In the L.A. you're doing pretty good. Listen, I count the building culpability is important in society. In a limited Greek lust is whole career and everything you had because he made down our bridges common. People thought it was our bridges, but in Rush Limbaugh he won't stop for any consequences because of who he is and where he is in the upper echelon of the Republican Party. Right. So what do we do? I mean, as a society, what do we do to correct these... You know, horrific disaster? I think the Republican... The most investing in the public can do if they're pissed off about it is to watch some other pregame shows as Zillion other pregame shows on Sundays. He's not on the game telecast. He's on a yes-being pregame, which is on a cable. And if people turn it off and watch you're one of the 50,000 other pregame or just not watch any of them, then those numbers are going to go down. That's what they can do. That's a beautiful thing. So people should do that. And we should also, like, you know, we've got the Arnold Schwarzenegger running for governor of California. I mean, if that's not the biggest, you know, I don't even have a term to describe what it is. Yeah, it's beyond belief. It's beyond a human comprehension that there could be anybody that's stupid. I mean, I thought in a beginning is kind of like a joke-fold. He'd be maybe five or seven or eight percent. But the fact that he's got 40 percent in the latest polls and he's beating boosted money by like a landslide, this has to tell you how many morons are about on a loose now. And you would think California would have economic repercussions. I mean, it's like the fourth biggest economy in the world. Why would they be voting for more on like this? Because there's a lot of morons live there, I guess. Okay, scary stuff, they'll scary stuff. Good luck to you, pal. You too, buddy. See you Niagara Falls. 560, 560. They got nice casino there Niagara Falls. I should point out. Yeah? Yeah. Meet everybody right there at the border right between Niagara Falls, New York, Niagara Falls, Ontario. Come across. Wave your over. We'll pass you over. 560, 560. What about that? Damn Rush Limbaugh, huh? Nothing going to happen. Don't even steal a madland bottle. I said, you know, we're lucky upon it's not human beings because we're getting paid. You know, that much money. You know, it's something which I'm still looking for answers for. I mean, if it's ratings, if the ratings go up. No comment. Can you can you imagine anybody saying, in the context of the NBA and all the great players Michael Jordan and all of you a big, all of you have big superstars to black superz. Can you imagine somebody coming on the earth saying, well, uh, the reason they're trying to make this guy look good is because they what the media is really helping on making a white center look like a superstarney NBA. Yeah. Can you imagine anybody ever saying that? No. No. No. First night. It wouldn't even get home that night. But Rush Limbaugh, man, and the right wing, they can do what say whatever it is they want because they, uh, they got the contacts. They got the good connections. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. On the moon thing, uh, I don't like him, but I like listening to him. And I can't stand Ferrell. Ferrell should not find a house down.

Because football ain't big here. The R goes that don't draw flies. They're always on a verge of going out of business. They talk about that, but football's just not big here. It's coming at the first to fry. But, but, but the basketball's going really well. Finally, well, the team sucks, but they do, they draw well. They sell out. Okay. All right, thanks, Robert. Okay. The answer is no. No, we never have a, I might want to see never, but not anytime, that your future won't have an NFL team in Toronto. We got the hockey two big, two big, even though they're going to suck this year. And you got to La Crosse, sold out to the, you're Canada center, which is, I'm using, but true and a rapper's didn't the draw very well like he said, even other teams sucks this year. But, what can I tell you? You can't, uh, be all things to all people. Isn't that what somebody wants to, didn't, uh, George T. Farmers, don't want to say that.

Do I have your permission to read it? Please, could you? Or? He says, I didn't strike out. I wasn't thrown out in above all. I wasn't forced out I'm out because I no longer in good conscience Truth would ignore the unabashed homophobia That is so carefully tolerated within the world of sports I'm out because the silence of a closet The gay man only serves to give his implicit approval The bigotry. I'm out because I refuse to continue hiding from the truth That an openly gay man has as much right as a straight man To play sports or report on them Frankly, I'm out because I can't come up with a single logical reason Why I should have denied myself the right to live and work is openly And freely is everybody else Nor should anyone find a reason why I openly gay athletes Who beat an unabashed right to play a team sport Without fear of becoming a target of prejudice or physical harm In the cases of both a gay athlete and a gay sports writer Homophobic athletes always come up with the same Sorry excuse to justify the perpetuation of prejudice On the basis of sexual orientation, the locker room What exactly does a straight athlete have to fear from a gay teammate or sports writer Any man's security should not have a care in the world When a gay man is present in the locker room He's only there to earn a living not to infiltrate a locker room A covert operation to convert straight athletes There are infinitely more friendly and healthy environments In which a self-respecting gay man would prefer to explore his sexuality Than a locker room full of straight guys From the viewpoint of a sports writer gay or straight The professional locker room is a relatively hostile environment Where too many athletes have their elephant us against mentality toward the media Reporters usually working on deadline Or only too glad the vacate the premises as soon as they're able to Extract enough quotes throughout their stories Should a gay athlete be brave enough to come out during his career He's been considerably more time than a sports writer in a locker room Likely causing some teammates to feel uncomfortable Being along a vast majority of straight teammates Even a homophobic player would have to eventually realize that he's not so vulnerable That he should be intimidated by the presence of a single gay teammate No active player in major professional sports team has ever come out But former NFL players as Sarah Tualo who'd have a sad Tualo and Dave Copay and former Major League baseball players Billy Bean and Lake Glen Burke Surely aren't the only closet gay athletes to share locker rooms with their straight teammates It wouldn't be surprising at all if their gay athletes on a great many professional teams Tolerated under a duplicitous don't ask don't tell understanding Somehow a gay teammate is only regarded as a threat if he's honest and a stand-up guy Qualities that are usually valued in team sports In an effort to justify homophobia somewhat claim that it openly gay player would become a distraction That would undermine his team A media friends he surely would be created by a player coming out of the closet But how long would a gay player be such a distraction if all his teammates rallied around him for the whole world of witness Professional athletes are role models and administration of team solidarity with send the profound message We support our team aid and you should too Obviously the climate is not ideal for a gay athlete to come out when San Francisco 49 is running backers and herst can say I don't want any faggots on my team and New York Giants tied ends here me shocking can call Dallas Cowboys coach Bill Parcells A homo without any fear of being suspended or found by his team or the NFL The gay community is the one minority that's still very much fair game for over displays of prejudice in the world of sports While inroads toward achieving a quality are slowly being made in the real world a gay man is still expected to bear the burden of shame In the sports world he's got rights or whatever really picture Tajones was quoted in dead for newspaper last spring before being treated in the red socks But he shouldn't walk around proud I'm out and I'm exercising my right to walk around prouds is a great I do like that a great in a box that Harold I wonder since he covers the sports that a hero does he get to see Tom Brady naked in the locker room Hey, is a perk Oh, how you spawning it? 5 6 7 0 5 6 He pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless line and a beautiful on Tuesdays. What I hear a lovely perk On air said Bob no back not see set of a bitch. They just hit on her for a second later today. Jody Bob no They're gonna be a guest on my five o'clock show. No, we can't wait. Well, it's great again And then hungry. Give me a warm hearing. Gonna be on a for company. Lead life to that. T and crumpets low the trumpet. It's staff at a crumpets What are crumpets anyway? Do we have any idea? Oh, they're they look like this. Oh, about this Size or similar to curge in way or spotted dick. Here's Miami runners deus. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Yes, I'm that the telemarking list. Okay, that the things right today. There are 11 executives that work with those telemarkening companies that are on that list. They themselves don't want to be called. Yeah, are you aware of that? No, I was not aware of that, but I am now. Yeah, is it funny? I'm so they put themselves on the list. Who the hell? Who the hell? They're right. My woodbottom be bothered getting 51015 calls a day for mass holes. Who the hell wants that? Yeah, I mean, I get paid to pay calls for mass holes, but that's it even though. All right, buddy. Take care. Thanks for the good news. I'm here great there. All right, let's make it tomorrow's pot bigger. It's an end of the thing it's Wednesday. We got that one to two hour coming in. See these people are like, I don't know, they're little off their feet this way. It's the jewel holidays again. You know, is that what it is? It's got to be. I told you that this morning before the show I forgot in about that. I thought there's a fact to say is it just possible let the PR machine that helped install G W to White House as used up Rush Limbaugh on his outgrown his purpose. Considering that possibility, the machine may just be allowing him to suffer strikes so they can be rid of. No, I don't think so. Beyond the doubt if the Bush cabal wants a second term, they'll have to use a snow job on the American voting public. The closer it comes to reelection time, I can just imagine a kind or a gentler G W to the second time around and the chronic public just might fall for it. Limbaugh's sole purpose was to muck rates that not of office. What purpose does he serve now? He has yesterday's meat loaf and ready for the trash. Oh, that's an insult to meat loaf. Maybe the garbage shoot was just greased. Oh, yeah. We can only try by sliding his fan asked down there. Here's another fact. I wonder if this is going to be accurate or not. It says, making tomorrow's pot bigger in George wants it right now. In fact, he and Scott are going to sit around and pick out the seeds during the one to two hour. For Thursday's van hit from noon till two, which Joe Costello had reviyama, 3671 Northeastern Highland Pablo Beach, with our vest of Neil merchandise including those vonded. Mohawk or David of Keychains and our CDs, etc. Endorse by Mohawk or David of Keychains. Yeah, that's right. Most have been playing a thanks mo. Thanks a lot. Even though the audience is hostile toward you. I mean, incredibly. Here's the deal. I have five pair of tickets to see Alice Cooper and consider the Pompatobie's amphitheater and Olae pair of tickets to the Panther Lightning game at the ODC, Othe Office Depot Center at the Intacenter on Saturday to fourth. Well, that's the next division game. So, I mean, that's nice, but it's an exhibition hockey, but they're free. So, at least they're trying Miguel is trying, he's trying to throw a little more crap in there. I mean, good stuff to give people out there tomorrow's swing and raise some bucks. It's been really tough. It's a tough year to raise money and I get all frost rate and flush to be know something it's good. It's good that I do that because that like embarrasses people and it works. They said a little bit tougher, but it works in the end. That's what Moha said. All it works. That's a loop in the end. Here's a call from Lake Worth, hello. Good afternoon Neil. Yes, sir. All right, and I'll roll in the background. I hope it's not too much in the air. There are some couple comments from earlier that the Rush Limbaugh factors is just hilarious. And of course, you know, nothing will be done. Because afterwards, there'll be, oh, we must stuff what he says. It's all of our balls we made in the sink on that. At the other one, the guy's saying, why don't we do about this next time we're all going to do this. I think we could have done about the last six years. Oh, get off your dead rear. Cook them right. People next year go to the hotel. I'm going to vote 40 times. I'm going to make damn sure next year election time I'll be down here. And I'm going to be voting all day long. And I think the Arnold Schwarzenegger thing is no different than the supposed, Paul showing the president's popularity. I think we will in the bet you just as though the popular vote went nowhere near half the people. Anywhere in this country could care less for him. I've seen it in ages. I have it in my head right now. As many as a million ballots could go uncount on election day next Tuesday throwing in the doubt for days or weeks. The outcome of the recall election. Because an unprecedented number of absentee ballots have a request to 2.7 million, but fewer than half of them. We turned by voters thus far. Leaving a huge number of ballots likely to be handed in the pouring place. or rather mail local relations. So you can see that you are all we're going to do just like they didn't Florida. And you can have all these Ziggins of votes out there and and who the hell knows who's counting what and what how long you're going to be counting. You know when you're up and you'll just show up within five days after the election in depending on which box they need them in. That's what they'll know up. Exactly how work and there'll be a bunch of bushings there'll be a bunch of bushings that the elections had quarters pounding out the door. I'm a bit nervous. I'm a bit nervous. I'm a bit nervous.

Let's give it a shot after a good going to be a tough game for a jay this weekend Isn't it interesting that the marlins are playing the giants and the dolphins are playing the giants? Almost at the same time, almost side by each That'll say that in Canada Here's an interesting story of her depressing Actually, it's a letter to the editor in the spokesman review, which is a spoke in the newspaper How was my first job? What delivering the spokesman review? Here you go. I want words. If you weigh long enough sooner later comes in handy Randy and Pam force you, would you shut up a minute Randy and Pam force you of spoke in right? Soldier must pay for his trip home We are usually quite individuals expressing little about world events and politics, etc However, we have to stand up and say something now Our son-in-law is in the army serving our country for several months in Iraq He was recently authorized to return home for two weeks, we're grateful for this news However, there's one catch he has to pay for the journey How can the government expect him to pay his own airfare? It seems unfair the government won't put the bill to send troops home after they risk their lives for our country They've had to leave their family struggling emotionally and some financially Then when they do have the opportunity to come on briefly, they're expected to pay their own way This is an atrocity And too often there's no way some of these families can afford the airfare Our country is spending a force on behalf of another country But our fighting forces should be the main priority, including traveling home for a reprieve We truly believe our armed forces should be rewarded with a paid visit to their loved ones Don't you? Say Randy and Pam force you have spoke in Washington It is morning spokesman review Is that pathetic or what? God! But to see there is no outrage in America There's no idea it's just like the thing with the limbo It's any of the stuff, there's not outrage People don't give a crap any mole And that's why there are America's initiatives that it's in right now 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, there's one call on the board Like I said, there's no interest, here's Hollywood, hello Hollywood I don't think there's even air Hello Hollywood, yes sir How are you?

Great, great, that's the gentleman's name Okay If you have a male coach or female coach and a male coach A team with the opposite gender They have to wait until the team is dressed Or undressed before they can go into the locker room I don't know I know that they do have female sports writers in men's locker rooms We saw that a long time ago That debate has been over for years My question was, should we be the same way for a gay writer Or a gay member of the media to have to wait until the same section Did you hear what I just got to you saying? Or you're like so determined to make your homophobic point You have your blinders and your plugs in Yes Okay Sir You should have made a difference No, it's not Okay That's all I wanted to know Do you think that it should? I sure should I think Why is that? Well, the sliggated from a male point of view Let me ask you this question When you were in a high school for example Because I know when I was in a high school We used to have to take showers together in gym class Okay Did they ask anybody? Is there any homosexual in here? There are any pancies in here? Did they ask anybody that question? There were all these guys who were under a brown show Nobody was ever having any sex that I know of But they were running around the show See, after you see one, so you've seen them all Okay Did there's this button there? Oh my god, there's a phag in there He's going to get all whipped up and excited Maybe start grabbing it I don't think I'd grab it You might No, I would not Because self preservation is very foremost in my mind Because he did not like my lights on about two seconds I mean, what did idiotic comment? You know, this is America for you again Don't you think he could clearly ignore what I just said about the women in men's locker room? Don't get in his way Right, don't try to mess on his point Because he's already got in his mind That this egg-ray Keep him out of the locker room Because he's head of a sexual's new They don't want to all faggs See them naked Oh my god Whew Especially all those beautiful football players 99% of whom nobody's interested in touching anyway Especially the big Proker alignment Maybe maybe Tom Brady could put him off like a cubby hole Or up to the side Don't want to say Give him his own shower facility What an asshole 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T line Here's the call from Davy hello Yes sir Oh, there's a story last week in the regular news I think it was on CBS news that similar to the one you just read When the troops got wounded in a rock they bring a motor tube Bethesda And they were charging in for their meals Right, yes, we had that surround our website right Yeah, also I find it very strange that just now your collars are starting to get in Realized that Rushlam was a fraud Yeah, I mean, well, how do you know just now that they're starting to realize that Well, they're because obviously he's on right now he's radio shows that a People are talking to me now are people are choosing this program over his fraudulent bulletcraft So I think they've been underwood for a long time Yeah, but you know what though the right wingers they're not playing fair They it's all politics anyway I mean, you know What do you want to say mean they're not playing fair every time the Clintons had a bad bow movement They had the dependent council and now when you really need an independent council The Senate yesterday wouldn't even take it up on the court But what are that kind of an oxy moronic idea right wingers playing fair? I mean, when once the last time you heard of that Right, I think that's a truth which is right what the see this is I was just thinking during the last break here Here's Maria Schriver who's a member of this Kennedy family and her mother by the way And oh yes, we're all for Ireland. He's going to make a great governor of California all the other crap and in the meantime Even setting aside the fact that he's a moron and he's a literate the fact that this is part of a Republican power play And it was financed by a right wing Republican manipulator And that's what this is all about to subvert the will of the likes of it again. Don't confuse the Kennedy family with a fangsug. I guess it's pathetic Yes, yeah, sadly it's so trying to find anybody in America who stands on principal anymore is not easy Yeah, but you know the people out there they don't wake up. We're going to get another four years at this clown in the White House And they think it really does scare me to see what he's going to do because if we went down this fast in less than three years What will we do with him having five more years On the Kennedy man progress being made here every day No, but I'm not joking. I'm serious. I'm not joking either. I would be happy to be here for completely serious. He's a very scary man. He made the world scare your place I'm so lonely correct Yeah, people need to wake up because he get out and vote and get this guy out of there because you know he's a kind of person that if somebody would say you know We're going to do this. Let me say this to you right now. The fact that there aren't millions of people pampering prison. I'm a teacher and right now, if they're starting a bogus war based on lies tells you that the people probably are not going to wake up Well, if they don't wake up, you know, we'll wake up in a morning and you'll see one of our cities destroyed You know, okay. Well, listen. Ski alarm clock and let us know what time it's going to go on Wake up George 1242 at 5.60 QAM I'm I'm Lonely, drifting through life without direction I want to talk to you about an exciting career as an Episcopal Bishop You see the flashy hand and robe are just the beginning. There's the glitz glamour plenty of TV coverage and a personally autographed 8x10 of RV Firestein with every archdiocese Commandments, manments We think of the mortars as a guest in. I mean 10 Commandments are 5. What if you can bat 300? It's fine with us. Catchings and option 2. Or if you're into this sweet science of boxing, you can always beat the bishop. Now if you're thinking, hey, I'm not a piscobal. How can I be a bishop? Don't worry. We have two bishops that are muslim. 5 A-fists and a Buddhist bishop that let your rubbish belly for good luck before you play bingo down at Saint Latoia's. Join us. The feud of Proud, the Colour Award-native Episcobal Bishops 1656-1657 to come up. We wanted to our count up briefly. And to show you how insane the certainly not news network is to show it a bunch of loomsics. Do you see what they have on now? Oh, there it is. David Limbaugh. The rest is brother. This good wedding boy in Proud. Who's written this ludicrous book called Persecution. Now see the first question we'll pass him as if this is the real reason the timing for this that they have a monitor. Well, any comments that you might have about your brother Russian is latest flat with ESPN and Donovan McNack. Well, I've been on a book tour. I'm out of the loop on that. So I really can't comment. I'm not a spokesman. My brother, sure. Yeah. And we'll see responses. Oh, of course we know that your brother can speak for himself. He's not shy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And what's this whole piece on? It's a puff piece to promote his book Persecution, which the thrust the accruxivities, the Christianity and America is being treated like a disease and the Christians are persecuted. Say, he's in the US. Right. So here's this asshole on there. Another right wing asshole is brother David Limbaugh. Why's nothing to say about the other thing? Because he's been on a book tour. He don't know not about it. He didn't know not. Just like the Nazis. They didn't know not. How do you like that? I don't. 459 votes on a Polish and he looks at how he dividends over tears of peace and love, which he's really trying very hard. We'll say that for him. That'd be fine. Absolutely not. We hate 055. 33.7% over a third. What do you ever do to them? Only if MoPains is bald spot 80. Only if Neil has no sufferings, Spat 79. So he had those three categories. You got like almost 70%. Yes, we need a harmony at QA. I'm a 77.16.7%. Say we need harmony at QA. And that was 68.14.8% say who's more Howard David? How do 459 vote? Anyway, there is hope in the future boys and girls in his name is Howard Dean. Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean Pope funded his fundraising success. Yesterday in his first appearance on a J. Leno show last night, they showed a clip. In a film clip, Dean was... Hahaha. Dean was shown playing a guitar on a street nest of signs reading. Your change for real change and will strum for presidency. People were shown placing money in an open guitar case. Kind of like you see on the damrack and I'm stood on. Posted updates on his website showed Dean and raised more than $14.2 million in a three-month period. Breaking the Democratic presidential record for a single quarter set by then president Clinton raised 10.3 million over three months in 1995. Earlier in the day, Dean campaigned in the University of LA promising jobs help care in a dialogue on race and a meeting with local leaders of Longman's Democratic presidential elections. Dean didn't call for money, but rather a sale person in Bush for what the Democrats said was the government's failure to put money into blighted urban areas. The former Vermont Governor also promoted his plans for widespread health care coverage and education funding and promised to work for creating jobs in the inner cities. He also supported affirmative action. We have a 400-year legacy of Jim Crow and slavery and that's not going to become over a big overcome because we all have good intentions. He said Dean called for a national dialogue on racial issues saying whites can be in different to the plight of minorities. Like Rush Limbaugh for example. I mean, I can't stop thinking about how stupid this is because in a wake of Jim Brown and Bobby Mitchell and Walter Peyton and Dale Sears and all the great black running backs in the history of the national football. He would be like saying, well, they wanted to make our wiki way you see a lot there. And he really is because the media's obsessed with making a black running back is okay. It's stupid. There are lots of very successful black quarterbacks. I forgot all about Michael Vick. Who just is a pure athlete maybe to best of them all just from athletic ability. But no, here comes this bag of right wing pompous crap. And what do we get on CNN? We give his brother their pocket about how Christians are persecuted in the mirror. Oh my god. Well, let's create if you ever put your damn beard and push on my screen. I just turned it off. I won't watch him. I'm watching the CBC. Oh, that whole question of whistle blowing.

He's everywhere. He hasn't has directed the White House to cooperate fully. That message was sent. Yeah, there's too much leaking courts going to White House. Okay, somebody got a bladder infection up there. Somebody's got a real serious problem. Oh, I like the guy that caught earlier. The dark complexity guy caught earlier going to show you had a good point. If they don't care about all these soldiers, we're getting killed over there in a rack for no good reason at all. Based on a bunch of lies, let me just think that they give her crap about the length of one woman who was a CIA operator. But how do they care about her? Did they care? No. Here's a call from Miami.
