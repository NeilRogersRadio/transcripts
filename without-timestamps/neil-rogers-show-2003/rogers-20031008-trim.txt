I got a good medical report from Duff this morning who's given me all those things about his back and about his hemorrhage and about all these other things Great. I Duff you know you're a good friend. You're a good guy, but I'm sick and tired of hearing a medical report Especially at a time when all the other crap is going down there a lot of crap. Yeah, you weigh him a lot of crap really down the down the shoe Lots of a place for it. So anyway, simple possession marijuana is illegal again in Ontario So those of you who are planning come up here and walking around in the streets like downtown like at the Eden Center lightening up a big fat when public How do you better think of second time? Look at this the lovely Miguel facts is me. We got about 30 man 30,000 and 25 bucks for abandoned per rescue. It's the eighth of October That's still pretty weak the way I'm looking at it. It's slow. Yeah, keep it along And that's cause nobody's got two nickels to rub together. That's a part of it. And that's why charity is like begging and screaming and cleaning those here who shape She's on a passion. Oh, she's the one who has all the visions like I do. She's begging. She's begging And Sheridan still live. She was underwater for about two weeks, but she's still alive and when I actually at the end of the show today, I should probably shouldn't tell people is but look like she dies The line on the what what do they call that thing we are still a scope. Okay, now the thing that they hook up to your heart the heart monitor electrocardi graph. Yeah, it's the flat lines in your view like that Thanks for ruining for me. You don't watch that show one of that I didn't ruin it for a I took away the stress now at least to be ready because you know she's not really gonna stay dead and Churry is begging the the the death guy the death the demon or who it all is begging. Oh, please save Sheridan. You know, that's not talk about that Let's talk about important stuff like the next van hit for a band of per rescue with our best to be a merchandise or yes The new cartoon on the al Rogers dot com right up on top. Okay, go look at that right now, but in the meantime Like I said the next van hit will be tomorrow noon to two see you're just trying to distract me from this because The van hit is sponsored by the wheel the other pages from bell south, which show you trying to distract me from my afforded grounds. Yeah, don't say it all kinds of problems going on in place and stuff is hyper ventilating and And for all this heaven of his great. Yeah, I think I've solved the problem though Because I think over the years as we look back on a history of south Florida where you're going back many many years It seems that there's really only one individual in south Florida who's really offended and put out by things that are set on the year Be there by me or Scott or whoever it is. I think generally speaking all we ought to do is take away his radio. Oh, they're Don't just think that would solve all of our problems for all of us every then he wouldn't have to be so offended and be monitoring and be so Indignant over the fact that all these terrible things are being said and yada yada yada just take away his radio I think it would be a great pubic service. It would be happy. We're a wacky thing to do but never let's hear make sense Anyway the van hit I will get this promo out by hooker by crook the van. It'll be noon to two tomorrow Sponsored by the real the elevators from Bell South at power sports. See how much commercialization This is what we need to do a QM because we have a big pay roll and because graves got big ambitions We got to pay all those teams that all those franchise fees so every even a promo has gotten out instead of one commercial that they got two of them in here Power sports at 10 90 West sunrise Boulevard in Fort London. Where is 10 90 West sunrise? Do we know is it near someplace over there? Yeah, no, no seriously. I don't know what that means. I know you know. I mean, I don't know where 10 90 would be neither Sure they can find it. Give your best to the emergency nice Argo fancy fancy CDs the keychain I'm on Howard David at once and the gym at it's once we have leftover for everybody who makes a donation while they last We might actually have some Marlon tickets. No, we won't a pair of tickets. So October fest this weekend if the German American Club in Hollywood will be available Though I don't know how he's gonna do that, but he says that's a now is that mean there's several pair or a pair I don't know what he's already what no idea. We don't know so go and see Miguel tomorrow between noon and two and find out if he doesn't give it to willingly slap around a little bit. He's easy Thirty thousand twenty five bucks. Well, least we got over the 30 more not There's something but that's more votes in great Davis gotten California last night And actually he got and they kept saying well Arnold is gonna be governor with it's very very close I don't have the final absolute final totals, but from the LA times I've got with my 97% of both counted Arnold got three million four hundred and seventy six thousand three hundred and one votes and the no recall which means the ones that were in favor of great Davis Three million four thirty eight you following that so about 38 thousand armally you had more votes Arnold which is scary in itself It is frightening man. It's enough to make me want to take a gigantic dump Oh, I think I'm gonna do it anyway. Oh wait about 25 to 30% of liberals and moderates abandoned the governor And Schwarzenegger had a strong showing across the political spectrum is the headline of front of the LA times Absolutely unbeatable. There's a really good article by Steve Lopez in today's LA times I might read it a little bit later. We have time under a lot of pressure today We're got to take 4,000 phone calls and say 25 Hail Mary's also Dear group and fewer muscles is waiting to office so what now right Steve Lopez in the LA times Dear group and fewer I just love that neck of a great line Oh God, yeah, he's doing the old group of dope Here's the fact that she's I'm not a sports fan. I haven't got a clue as far as baseball is concerned, but we're so blessed To have the Marlins in the playoffs because at least he keeps my mind off all the depressing stuff like that Farcent or West Coast and number two in Washington is gonna get away with another major scandal because this is the dumbest country in the world history hands down Contest over. Thank you for a very very accurate facts by the way to pull look at that 133 votes. I just took a puke at it Man, we're on fire today Play which of these huh flaming can't you smell it? Which of these statements do you most strongly believe we got 133 votes? You can say a douchebag Americans are poorly educated 41 Right now machine to be in American 36 America still a greatest country in the world 26 Neil is anti-American anti-16 and an American's don't give a Schmidt about politics 14 So 12% of the audience are saying I'm anti-American excellent See I put those on air for the segment of the audience that likes taking a cheap shot at me or you or you know We're probably the only show in history that does that because you know we we can handle it. We got thick skin George is got four skin. I got thick skin So here is this this astonishing amazing Oh, and also Miguel who's trying to come around a little bit he said that nestle's turtle is really good. He hated He called it Ben and Jerry's fish not fish food the fish. He just such an idiot And then he said, but I did try nestle's turtle and it was really very good. You write that awesome stuff But it and then it come out to find out it wasn't even nestle's it was Briar's turtle Which had you know Briar's made a turtle, which you got at pubics, okay? You're an idiot Miguel you're a moron Very sad you look good, but man you're dumb He says go to show that huh he says to model yeah two mama cycle can sit at number four eat two mama time being Anyway, so Miguel likes a turtle. So it's that public. So you don't have to wait for the nestle's turtle if Briar's is making it if Briar's is making it It must be pretty damn good now Sure because Briar's makes that score ice cream. Oh, don't find that. I sure hope you folks can't get a hold of that Because then you'll be cursing me out big time the same people who died from getting hooked on fish food because of me When they find the Briar's score ice cream that's SK OR then they'll know the score all right The blood pressure will be up to like 300 over 250 and they'll be dying over there, but with a big smile on their face that stuff is obscene It's so good Of course you're not into that. I don't know who it is the score candy bars score in heat bar. Yeah, that topy thing. Oh man Wow 27 past 10 at 5 60 WQM.

They haven't seen him in a long time Probably about 75 now you'll know you're getting real old when Robbie Benson is 75 then you're gonna sell holy crap River Phoenix is still dead. I should point out here What while there's a criminal in the front of that now I'm looking at the second pool Which I was gonna start and then I thought wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute see I This is my band I left the word out here. What was the most horrifying death scene? Oh, I didn't leave it out. No, yeah, that scene Because we've done the horrifying scenes, but we haven't ever done specifically this pool If we do exactly the same one some nitpick rothioca. Oh, you're changing that like a January third of 2002 You did that pull yeah, well blow it out your ass. Speaking of polls. Did you look at the website yet?

It's in such poor taste. Well, it's only a cartoon character If the if the title would only be the cartoon's I agree probably still be a good shape today, you know It's still like hanging on by a thread So anyway, here's the final the very close to final numbers in California for those 10 people I turn the audience who we'd give a crap would 97% of those counted The first question on a ballot three call or not to be called the very very unpopular gay a great Davis A member of the personality like a dead fruit fly 54.4% said yes to the recall only 45.6% said no, so and they actually an LA county They voted against the recall, but in orange county they voted and all the other right wing parts They voted humongously they hate them In the contest replaced Mr Davis missed his Schwarzenegger lead his nearest competitor lieutenant governor Celia Cruz boosted him on the 47.9% to 32.4% with 97% of okay so in other it's 48% to 32% A gland slide for odd In an appearance before cheering supporters late in the night mr Schwarzenegger opened his victory speech by thinking his wife Maria Schreiber saying I know how many votes I got because of you Right Infiduced by J. Leno. Oh, it's just it's This is the end this is the end boys and girls they'd like Jim Morrison would say if he could it's all over So what the shoun Their group and fewer muscles is way too office so what now?

Right now I'm proud to be an American and choose the American flag. And where the stars in there used to be in the upper uh, it's got a swastika instead. And it says, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United Republican American to the dictatorship for what it's worth. One F. Up nation under their fear, which stupidity and empathy for all. Sponsored by the sigpree and Roy campaign for governor. Roy. Oh, yes, who's going to be an American tonight? Sickreet? Yeah. Sickreet fishbucker. Oh, fishbucker. Fishbucker. Oh, is that what it would be? Yeah, he's going to be making growling sound. He's pretty unhappy about it because now he's livelihood went right down the toilet.

But to the pretty tight right there. 264 votes. Which of these statements do you most strongly? Believe Americans are poorly educated. 99. Right now, I'm ashamed to be in American 61. America's still the greatest country in the world. 53. 20% Neil is anti-American. 27.2% and Americans just don't give a Schmidt about politics. 24. 9% of 264 stays shocking. Total in like about a half an hour, George. What does that mean? I don't know. Nothing. I think that the public is whipped up and pissed off to a frenzy this morning after seeing this debacle in California. Even though we have a lot of people out there claim they don't really care because it isn't just about some stupid ass a little bit person out of his father was an Nazi or something like that. It's about not even just about their growping fewer. It's about the fact that here we had another election stolen by the right wing in this country. And you know, this is going to be the pattern. And every time they don't win time like that article, I read yesterday about Tom Delay that we district being trying to do in Texas. So they can have a few more while we're public in the city in the Congress. It's unbelievable. And the public is, oh, they're straight. Oh, yeah. Hey, hey, nice chin, baby. See the hand of ring J. Leno up because he's got a chin and Maria don't. Oh, good. Yeah, so somebody was going to play a mean chin ball. They had to have somebody with a chin to play with it. So to play with J. Leno's chin. God, what a disgrace. What a what a a farce. So every time there's an election result, oh, this is now who's this from? Why is he doing this again? Oh, PD Lenny. I say, did you receive this yesterday? You asshole, I don't know. I get it yesterday. I talked about it and stopped. Facts of me. You're worth the norma can't you? It if you moron, PD Lenny go away. See, did I get it yesterday? Go to hell away. Okay, I wish I hope that the Mac truck runs over your ugly ass. God. It's just it's pathetic pathetic. The first lesson I want to give to all you kids out there when you grow up in about 30, 40 years. How many? Don't give out your phone number. Your facts number to any assholes. Okay, because sure enough they'll use it. Good lesson. Don't give it out. When and doubt don't give it out. PD, freaking Lenny my ass. Go away. You jackass. You okay? You civilen. You cigarster Indian clown. Always do this because they're all obsessed. They're just their entire life. We've all surrounded this program. In three years, or if I should quote sooner, like in a few days. What the hell are these people going to do? Fold up their tent and just throw it to the Vegas. That's right. Probably be on the cartoon on our website next. WQAM. Yes, speaking. Okay. Hey, you know what? I was referring to the question for you. Yeah. A couple days ago somebody called and told you about the movie with Johnny Depp. Did you get a chance to look at it? Not yet. Behind the night behind the something behind the fall. Behind the fall. Before night falls. Before night falls. Before night falls. Right. Before we got winter there's fall. I was trying to put up a few numbers in the night. And even somebody else with a George Say or somebody said it was damn good. I heard it was good from all kinds of things. I heard it was damn good. Damn. Okay. Well, let's thank a lot. Okay. Enjoy. Enjoy. Palli. Because times run and out. Probably not going to be able to get any videos. Probably only going to be able to get government approved videos and stores from Coast to coast. Probably. Schluckbusters. Gonna be deciding what you can see and who you can think of what you can read. Better go out and get that new Michael more Michael. More is a dude wears my country book today. Do we have to order that from Canada? Yeah. Yeah, but not if you're smoking a big fat one. Now I do have to go out and get that today. Because pretty soon they'll be knocking that off the shelves too. Because freedom is a thing that has passed in America. You can't complain about our freedom. Now the Patriot Act 345 are going to come along. Which means that you can't fart in public. Or even in private. Gotta hold it. And if you have like a dirty look on your face or if anybody thinks that you might be a little bit to the left of it till the Han man you're done. That's also lia lot. That's the best thing to do. I personally love this president. 28283 votes on our poll. There's pouring in the votes today. They're pouring in. How about some suggestions for other poll here? I mean a little by little. What? We got like one at a time. Oh they're coming on the fan. Yeah. What about on the phone if I take a lot more calls and stop BS and maybe I get some. What was the most horrifying death scene ever in a movie? Father, carousel in the exorcist. Melting Nazis in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Father, carousel in the exorcist. We didn't really see him. We signed go down the window. Yeah. Down the stairs. We did call the bottom of the stairs. Right. Coming to me. Coming to me. Kind of like a Kathy Wilts, always used to say. Coming to me. WQAM. Neil? Yes sir. Neil. Have you ever seen the movie final destination too? No. There is every death scene in that movie is like his hideous. Really? Yes. And you know what? I tried to get through yesterday for your poll about who still looks good in age well. You remembered gone well from Gilligan Island. Good choice. Hey did that. You remember Jennifer Wells? Thanks Neil. I'm your Joe man. Okay. Thanks, Bally. You see that dirty little nervous life on this agenda for Wells? How about the scene from the alien where the mini monster comes out of the cyberbots test cavity at the dinner table for your poll? Yeah. It's not a tumor. So we got it. I'm not going to write it. That's long. Because this requires a lot of iris what? Going to go nuts. Too bad. Too bad. We won't do this again. I reckon. Maybe tomorrow. We won't do this again. We want to like impose on his generosity in his time. Because he's a very, very busy guy. Many, many meals to eat. Look at this. We're going to have 300 votes in the next couple of minutes here. Next to maybe 30 seconds. How many? About 30 minutes. Man. Oh man. Oh man. A shivots. So what's the deal I was for Wells? He's going to like I do a religious show on a station? Pade religion. That's the way to go Scott. Forget about ego. Forget about all the other bullcraft. Forget about sports. Just paid religion man. You can bring on some different fake or everyday in charge. I'm like by the minute. We're going to get a basket and pass it. Now, Tisket of Tisket. Let's put some into basket. Got help us. Oh god. Which of these statements do you most strongly believe? 301 votes. Americans are poorly educated. 109. Right now, I'm ashamed to be in American 73. That's 24.2% of the audience is ashamed to be in American with this president with that government call of 40 even with 3000 miles away. American of course, look what we got. America is still the greatest country in the world 62. 20.45%. There you go. You keep saying that pretty soon you'll believe it. Neil is anti-American 29.6% Americans don't give a Schmidt about politics 28 out of 300. Monvote so far. Their group of viewers is the governor of California. And then the Michael Morrison there and obviously Tom and Cheeky said that he even suggested this book Oprah for president. That's what it takes man. That's what America has become. How about Oprah for president? I'll vote for that bitch. Anybody to get these Nazis out there? And then Solideth says, Oh, do you think America's really ready for a black female president? Uh-huh. Solideth O'Brien man, bubble head would be an insult if I caught her a bubble head. It'd be an insult to every bubble head who's ever been born. It was ever crawled around on a face of a globe. She is a simple, a simple and simple man. Solideth O'Brien. Another big true for these certainly not news network is they straight to rise up off the MSNBC carpet. Good God. Even dry concepts would have tossed her ass away. That's what a piece of crap she is. Solideth. And then you got the Aaron Brown with his pasty red wig. And then you got Jeff Goldblum who sits on air who don't want to say Not not Jeff Goldblum. What's his in Jeff Greenfield? Same guy. You ever see him, Jeff Greenfield? Was he in the fly too? Yeah, he should have been. I only wish. God. Just another whiny guy who doesn't say anything. And well, the voters say. And then there's that wolf Blitz Creek man who looks like he's ready for the next moon meeting. You ever see him and Rudolph has together. In fact, I hear wolf Blitz Creek gets his gas at his head. That's what I'm hearing. 1057 at 560WQ and by the way, those sounds that you hear that coming from California. This is those good. Get your hippo dad baby and start doing a old booster.

Right. Here, open fewer muscles as way to office. So what now, right Steve Lopez, the day's LA times? He says you can count the days now until Arnold Schwarzenegger is Governor of California. And great Davis is working as a groupie at the Marango Casino in Camazon. The final telly isn't in as I pour myself a celebratory drink on Tuesday night. But we've got something even more solid than a final telly. CNN just said J. Leno was about to make a victory appearance with Schwarzenegger. Perfect. A campaign that began with the late knock comedian might maybe not arise by him. And so we've had our little revolution and the new emperor is their group and fewer, which in Austrian means, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. By the way, those who believe the LA times was trying to knock out Schwarzenegger last week with stories about his grouping proclivities over look to important points. First, if the plan was to knock him out, the stories would have run much sooner than they did when they might have had some damn image, second, any self-respecting hack would rather have Schwarzenegger to write about them Davis. In fact, I'm from Northern California and I'm taking a moving back. I'll just have to wait and see if Schwarzenegger decides to actually live in a state capital or take the private jet home to Brentwood each night. One thing I have to say about Arnold is that his victory was no fluke. Yes, we all know this was primarily about the hated Governor Great Davis not Schwarzenegger. We know that was growing rage about the way businesses done in Sacramento, where lobbyist owner of L'Amaker, and we all know California's believe that it worked off on everything from electric bills to vehicle license fees, and they're not too happy about having to shell out for illegal's about to flock north for the free drivers licenses Davis is passing out. But let's give Arnold a credit he deserves. If you can trap on your own campaign promises, avoid talking about fixes for the state's problems, drive a homer in Smog City, get accused of pawing 15 women and still captivate and electorate in which Democrats hold a huge advantage, you deserve to be governor and the people deserve you. I'm reminded of the candidate to film in which Robert Redford plays a rookie who pulls off an upset wind's election of the US Senate in the last scene, Redford turns to his campaign manager and asked, what do we do now? That's the $10,000 plus question for Governor Arnold and all of California, now that this latest advantage in Sundry, democracy is trying to enclose. Right now we've got fiscal and ideological impasses state library in Kevin's star, Republicans want no new taxes, no new anything and let's lay everybody off, it's the meat cleaver approach. The Democrats on the other head have got to learn something from the Republicans, you just can't spend spend spend like you on a sugar high. Sure, but in such a polarized culture, how can Arnold or anybody else get the Republicans and Democrats to agree on the time of day, let alone find common ground on backing programs, putting it into borrowing and we're working the tax system. There's only one way it can happen, you may not like hearing it, you're going to have to hold them accountable, which means you've got to start paying attention to stories about state government, even when they don't directly involve big boy. Early in the recall campaign, I wrote the following paragraph about the lifecycle of the average eligible voter in California. Pino attention, Pino attention, Pino attention, Pino attention, it hopping mad about what happened about no one was paying attention. Sign a petition skip the election, complain briefly about the consequences, Pino attention, Pino attention, Pino attention. That's right, you're as responsible for this state's promises anybody else. Half of you didn't bother to vote in the 2002 election for Governor, you're probably still don't know who your state assembly and senate representative. You saw dozens of stories in this newspaper about the state budget and quickly flipped to the TV listings, you saw stories about campaign finance reform and you left into a coma. You didn't even pay attention when I told you, Davis hadn't obsessive compulsive fundraising disorder, and then we were going to pay dearly. You run CS until a celebrity action hero threw his Mr. Universe crowded at the ring. Then all of a sudden, your nap was over, you were a student-state politics and you buttoned the idea that a recall could fix everything. Well, guess what's Barkey? I like the idea for a public and muscle man riding her to where he's been happy to put a cleagest later, but nothing's going to be fixed overnight no matter what you were promised during his campaign. In fact, as you read this, the governor is probably looking this team and asking, what do we do now? Good article by Steve Lopez in today's LA Times. There's a broken fewer muscles is waiting to offer so what now? That's great. There are broken fewer. Let's don't ever forget that line. What a great, here's Governor, a broken fewer. Let's go step baby, come on! Forget the twist, forget the Holy Gully, forget all of these things, forget the hip-hop crap. Let's go step. It's the American F and Wayne now. 355 votes on a pool, the audience is foaming at them out today. They're like rabbi's. Which of these statements do you most strongly believe Americans are poorly educated at 131? Right now, I'm ashamed to be an American 81. America is still the greatest country in the world 78. Neil is anti-American 34, 9.5 percent, and Americans don't give a Schmidt about politics 31, our 355 votes. A spectacular total in dust and an hour, George. I think we ever had in dust and an hour? I think it's time for the hour of power, maybe a shower. Sounds good to me. That'd be a golden shower. Wait to near this story. Ha ha ha ha. I love it. Isn't that interesting? We're leaving it our pool, and you people are getting right by the way. Americans are poorly educated. What's in here this? Now the Gallup News Service granted George Gallup as a well-known Republican pollster, even though it doesn't call themselves such, but he's a right-winger. Not a real extreme right-winger, but like, you know, for a few years before the really was a rabbi's right-wing. But anyway, regardless of that, I believe it. Princeton, New Jersey. Gallup Organization reports, 45 percent of Americans believe the news meet in this country are two liberal. While only 14 percent say the news meet are two conservative. These people must have never discovered Fox News Channel. Ha ha, I haven't found it yet. These perceptions of liberal inclination have not changed over the last three years. A majority, and they must have been watching the news during the Operation Iraqi Freedom Business on MSNBC, and certainly not news network and all these others, because all of the people are watching and they're flag waving in the ass sucking. We just, I guess, my imagination. These perceptions of liberal inclination haven't changed over the last three years. A majority of Americans who described their political views as conservative, perceived liberal meanings in a media while only about a third of self-described liberals, perceived conservative meanings. See, the problem in America isn't conservative boys and girls. The problem is everybody else. Liberals, moderates, independence. That's the problem. We'll carry on as that politics sucks and it's boring, and everybody much rather worry about getting some pre-marlin tickets and getting laid today a couple of times. But the bottom line is that it's the other people who are sitting back on her ass while people like Arnold and everybody else is like in a feeding frenzied out. They've goose stepped their way right there and brought daylight right in Dave County. Let us in. Let us in. Let us in. They stole the guy in the election right there for your push with help with their hired paid henchmen on the Supreme Court. It is absolutely unbelievable is what it is. How there can be so many stupid people, 207 million people. How many people and IQ larger than their thumb. How many things? About 30,000. 560,000. 560. What's the most horrifying death scene ever in the movie is our... We'll keep this on for a while because I like the way we're getting that response. Yeah. Hmm. Chucking. Hello. I'm good Neil. Yes sir. How you doing, man? Pretty good. Okay. What about the Scarface? The... What's all? Oh, that's a good one. Yeah. I like it. Yeah. Put it on the A. Smallville.

You're excited about Arnold. No more excited about that place. That place. I'm so glad that I'm not there, man. And let's like, yeah, you are. They like to export it. They like to spread it around. You know, Greg. And there's stuff. What are we going to do? It's a fight. It's a fight. And wacky jackies on the foe. What are we going to do? Uh, grow up already.

She said I'm busy joining boob uns. Who have been gold? I said quote you. Please leave me alone. Oh, I didn't think I'm going to pass her stones. As we left to go up through your parking lot. I snapped a guard around my heart to beat it. I tried to fix it so it wouldn't pick no more. Yes, I was flattened in the middle of the door. So my guy says he helps with your story. I tell him why I think I'm going to pass her stones. After loading up I make you really more keen. My wife was waiting for her to come to the beach. Oh, there's my wife, she was remote to get the time. I asked her to keep a link there for the other day. They said smoke. You got her wrong. Oh, oh, I think I'm going to pass her stone.

What's the real story? See, I don't know if Scott was kidding because I don't know what the hell he said. Because we don't get a chance to listen. And then of course the crossover ended about as abruptly as like, just like that. I thought he was just reading Bible passages this morning. But our crossover there was like, like I said, that was pretty much it. Well, he was in a big hurry to go in there and bitch at him and scream and jump up and down like Rumpel stills. Good luck, Scott. You'll need it. It says, by the way, I have a ticket for you to the Marlon Serious Center. Well, first of all, I have no idea who this is. And what does that mean? I don't know. I'm going to be there to go to the game. No. So maybe there's a ticket for you, Scott. Yeah, just call out. I mean, I didn't even need your self. It's me. Just call out and say, hey, that ticket that you had for Neil, he ain't going to be here and he don't want it, but I'll take it for Saturday or Sunday or whatever you want to give it to me. By the way, how about those Marlon's, huh? No interest in that in this crowd. No, no calls just like yesterday. No interest in that whatsoever. Let's get back to the important stuff. The most horrifying death scene ever in a movie. Although we do have four hundred and five outs under the pool, which is pretty damn impressive. Aren't you excited? I think you should just leave it. Go. Leave that up there all day. I can work on this one all day and then do it. And then put it up there tomorrow. Which I want to do tomorrow. See, that's not good thinking. You have to be thinking ahead. You're not thinking ahead. You're not thinking clearly. Your judgment is clouded by all the pressure and hysteria and psychosis that's going on in that building. Oh, most of which is of course being spread by. Yeah. Yeah. What? Nothing. Well, that's what I'm most of the psychosis. And that's staring at building gets generated and whipped up because of the. And his emotional breakdowns, which happened like every day, every hour on the hour. Although we didn't have a good health report this morning. That's good. How's that cold? Yeah. He calls Dr. Neel. The let me know how his innards are doing and his. Back home and all these other things in his privates and that's. It's corpoles. He's thinking of getting one of his nipples pierces. What do you say? Really? No. 567.0560 pound. 560 on the AT and C in horizon. Wireless line. Look at that pool. 405. Oh, it's so proud. And please. Which of these statements do you most strongly believe? The statements are poorly educated. 36.7% of this crowd. That's 149 people say. Yeah. They say. Right. Or a scott would say. Right now. Machine to be in America 92.2.7%. America's still a greatest country in the world. 87.21.4% can't. They don't want to be confused by the facts. Neel is anti-american 41.10.1%. Again, I put myself in a position of being a human punching bag. And I don't mind because I've had 30 years experience. How many? 30 men. And Americans don't give a shit about politics. 36.6 obviously. They did. We wouldn't have the. Uh, what's the totally. They grow up in a hammer. They grow up in fear. Yeah. The grow up in a. They grow up in fear. I wouldn't be the governor of California today. Regardless of what an asshole grade Davis. See, again, I don't play nemablanet democrats. What kind of a candidate is the Celia Cruz Buzdemonte? Yeah. What a joke that is. Always the same old crap man. You got Michael Duke caucus and Walter Mondale. Molly's other wimpy wimpy weasley out. Gore wouldn't have Gore. Who did win the election by the way, but of course not by enough. Not by enough to avoid the esteemed. You know, he's not California. What? You start nopped out again. He won by a grand slide. And speaking of landslide, I don't run by over million votes last night. Over a cruel C.D. Cruz Buzdemonte. Over Jose and Freddie Cruz. One point two. I think he won by like 3.5 to 2.3 something like that. In fact, if I wasn't so lazy now, went to the CNN website. Nobody cares. Oh, they do. Because it's got the updated number on there if I can find them. Here comes it's coming. Yeah. 3.567. 3.567. Tots and Tots and Tots. Like a boost amount of 2.383. So one by damn near 1.2 million votes over Celia Cruz. So nice going democratic party in California. No wonder you got your ass whipped. Okay. By a superstar by the Terminator is terminating great Davis. Even if any answers to anything, it is not how they're going to eliminate that 10 billion dollar deficit. He has no ideas about anything going. He hasn't got a clue about education because he never had one himself. But he sure knows how to squeeze a hot ass. I'll tell you that. Or even a look warm one. 5.670560 pound 560. He don't think we got to put the other pull on there today. What do you think Scott? Why not? Why not what put it on there? Sure. Yeah. I agree with you. This is too uh... I mean we had a really phenomenal response and that's good. But now let's move out of importance stuff like good death scenes. WQA and death central. Hey, now what's up? Yes sir. How you doing? I'm alright. I guess. I can't believe yesterday that somebody came up with that left Jon Collins off that pole yesterday. Yeah. She don't look at over 100. Yeah. Good night from New York. 560 five 60 pound five 60. Yeah. Let me say it again. All these people listen to Talk Shows for all these years. And I think there's all these hundreds and hundreds of people call Talk Shows. There's only about thirty minutes. Same people. Same voices. Like that first one right on the bottom. The second one. Line 9 there, that guy. I'll always with that same like, and the same tone. I think he's got it on a tape. See, he wasn't ready to go to his computer. He was starting the tape up. So we're here at the sound of his own voice and squeeze it all day long. He's squeezing and squeezing. Nothing's happening, but he's squeezing. God. Very very sad. The misfits, so many misfits and so little time, including the ones who are monitoring, and they're sitting there when they're listening, and they're writing their letters, and they're making their phone calls, and they're making up names, and they're doing all this other crap. Get our freaking life. That's my message, okay, wacky one and all you other ones out there. Get out of the life. All you people in your closets with your skeletons, rattling around every side. You running around in your underwear, yanking it all day long. Go get a life. Go find one. Get a search party, okay? 26 past 11 at 5, 16, WC, we got our big wins. They won the two hour today. All we can say about that is, a ride, bet, man. Thank the Lord. Oh God. Hallelujah. And thank goodness that none of us be living in California. See you thought it was bad, would Jeff Bush? Jeff, do I say this? I bite my tongue, saying it to the point that blood is dripping down my chin. Jeff Bush is a rocket scientist. These are genius compared to what they got in California. Oh, you notice with all those millions of votes last night, they got 98% of the votes count of already. And so it's only like 830 in the morning in California right now. They got 98% counted. Absentee made up for whatever ones they wanted. That's incredible. Hot they did that. Feet's me. They were checking for hanging chads and hanging fads and kads and a few moms and dads. And some of them, California's are looking for some young lads. But nevertheless, Arnold's got the big nads. 26 past 11, no, seriously. Look how embarrassing that is to floor to the fact that I'd like millions of millions of millions. And they had like over 70% turnout. They broke all records last night. gigantic turnout because they're pissed off and fired up at Grey Davis. And they had the odd, they had a big more of the terminator. But more could you want what a combination. Even at that, what is that place where they have the poison meat? Jack in the box? Jack in the box, they never had a combo plate like that. Now here's a fact that says what happened to Ferrell this morning is Greg. We trying to censor him. I guess he likes to screw with the talent and QM remember Joe Rose and says Greg read you are an asshole. But there's a lot of a lot of heavy duty crap going on. I'm not going to get stuck in the middle of it. Okay, because I already sacrificed two years of my life some years back. And had to go through all kinds of hell and crap. And I'm all for Ferrell. I stand by him on 98% except for the 2% where he don't know where to draw the line. That's my comment. Amen. Just yes? I said amen. Yeah, that's right. We're all behind your Ferrell. But just, you know, tone it down a little bit.

I mean, that was like kind of nasty when he went to plop and on his stairs there. And his head kind of like twisted around ass backward, but by that time we'd by that time in a movie we'd seen so much Gore and cuts and slime and puked that it didn't really make them. It was kind of attack right now. We were a little jaded by that. Yeah. But I'm not saying that that's not a good choice because then strong instead of the pull hook it all you know, Benauta shaped stuff like that. All I want to ask you. Jimmy, why you do this to me? And Raiders lost our head in the sea. Please, Jimmy. I'm afraid. Yeah, that was more cool than horrifying. In pale priest in the home and I did see that. I guess I'll vote for that even it would not be my choice. That was, yeah. It was okay. What about in the godfather? Any of the three where there are a lot of people got murdered, but I don't think there was any horrifying that scene even one was pretty fun. You mean when a tournament like walking Swiss cheese? Did it to my boy? Oh, look at this. The top 50. Yeah, there you go. The spashtot to Eric. Wow. Well, we're now now. You're not doing that. Are you? Also, great article in table. I knew November 2003.

That's a good question. I don't know. I think it means the scene from casino. No casino baseball, bad at and buried alive. Blade. Frost turns into a blood blister. Gear hunter, Russian roulette. Man by its dog, old woman shouted to death. Platoon of this is a great list. Psycho. We got that top fiction accidental face shot. Yeah, it was good. Seven fed to death fed to death. Buttony. Why?

Tell me the weasel. A clip. That's a good place for him. The godfather. That's what you said. Santino. The hobo tune. It's shot. Selling in the cause. You want you to just, uh, you're right. Thanks. This list in there. I mean, it'll break you. Just drive him nuts. Huh? Here goes. Eric, we apologize. No wait. No. No. Well, this is great. Just blame whoever facts this marker. Whatever this guy's whoever sent this to us. I can't read his chicken scratching. It's the 50 top movie death scenes. And you can vote for your favorite one. That's the idea. The poll nightmare on Elm Street. Howl it out by Freddy or we just go home. Hannibal disemboweled and hung. I've seen a few movies where guys were hung. The wicker man, Burton side of wicker man. That was good movie. The rock or the wicker man was good. This is what? Uh, see that. When I were back, I had a movie. Again, boys and girls, when I was there, go out and spend a lot of money like I did during the summer. Let's say, uh, a sleeper. See now now, for an echo, they could one flow over to Koofoo's and that's suffocated by the beginning. That wasn't a horrifying at all. That was, uh, Moril's ridiculous. Huh? Melancholy, little side, but nevertheless had had not horrifying. No. So cross that one. Maybe you should cross them these out before your facts are resolved. Okay. Eric, I'm going to facts to get with some cross out. Oh, no. Braveheart, hung drawn and quartered. I was pretty, uh, the mission crucified it over a waterfall. Trains spawning, toxoplasts, Moses, which thank God. I didn't, oh no. Yeah, I told you you didn't get to the good parts. Brain pops from cat. Schmidt. Isn't that lovely? The untouchables, Connery machine gun to death. Oh, thank God. So tired of him already. White heat made it mod of the top of the world.

Hellraiser skin ripped apart by fishing hooks. Raiders of lost arc melted by angels. Time-cop. Doppelgangers merged to death. The mummy flesh eating scarves. I'm gonna scratch a lot of these out. Bush Cassidy in the Sundance Kid Shantpadi, Bolivian Army, jaws bitten in half. Starship troopers, Dina clawed in the back. Yeah, that was pretty unpleasant. Robocop melted by toxic waste. Warlock, saltwater death. Tatsy driver killed by long gunman. Running man chainsaw balls. Kiss of the dragon, headblood rush. Oh, headblood rush. Not a few more rush. The deep, Connery ill bites head off diver. Scarface, are we got that one right? Yes. Can we port it to Silly serial killer? Headcrest by TV. Fargo the woodchipper. The godfather, Markle Corleoni killed steam in the rest. I don't think that was horrifying. I was as a great scene. Was it horrifying? And first of all, he didn't kill steam in the rest. Ready killed too. This is the stuff you find on the internet is very aggravating. He didn't kill no stream in in the loy and Louise in the Bronx. He killed Silly. He killed McCloskey. Only two. Isn't that pathetic? Go to show you. When you look at stuff on the internet, like ask a lot of questions. Only two. Only a pair. Single by females. The letter through the eye. And seven kept a lie for months. Don't we have some of this from like their sounds for the land should be? It's two from seven so far. Right. Exactly. I'm saying what about sounds for the land. It's the only was one on here. I think. Which I can't even find the damn thing. So there's a good list. There's 50 more. So this is a list we got today. It's going to be gigantic. So I'll just vote for one just to see how things are going. Okay. And before Eric leaves. I'll vote for the MPL priest in the home and even though I don't believe that for a moment. In fact, the home was on again a few days ago. I actually seen it. One with Gregory's peck. Curves stopping murder American history X11 votes chainsaw seen in 1210. Alien eruption in alien. Eight. Do you believe that was Bob weaver? The came right through the Gornese chest. Charsine in psycho seven. Impaled priest in the home in three. And after that, well, we're just getting to go in again. The way to get those other 50 up there. Eric plays along with us. If not, nice known you. Four minutes till noon. Well, I'll tell you the times the way to the United States. We're going to have like a pressure pack show. I told you tonight. Right at the outset. I knew that that's more by psychic powers kicking in. Speaking of getting kicked into butt. If you got a big fat butt, the rest of you is pretty like how to gigantic overhang. Here's the answer for you. Balance for life. How's the beast doing? We hear any words on the beast. Hey, so that number six. He just waddled in and waddled out. And what do you say? I think you scared him on. Did he say? I'm fat and ugly and gross. He said. And can't you lead? Well, anyway, maybe you guys out there would like to get laid. Fat guys don't get laid nearly as much as guys who look a little bit better. Okay, so that right now. Balance for life can up.

The Supreme Court has held that there is undoubtedly a substantial government interest in the prevention of abusive and coercive self-practices through ruling be Sam. The court questioned the conclusions of U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham of Denver, who said the list violates the telemarketing of the series' free speech rights by burying calls from businesses but not charities. It also noted that Congress had found some telemarketing calls of Dickick and Sumerstice substantial fraud, deception, and abuse. FTC Chairman Timothy Murris called the latest ruling a victory for American consumers and said his agency will return to enforcing the list to which we say, A RIDE! The FTC heads stepped in and last met a tantal enforcement long-deregistry take effect last week, Yadiyada Yaddy. The court by this and finished, though, the appeals court said the FTC can run the registry while a challenge from telemarketing is wind that's way through the court's oral and anal arguments were scheduled in Tulsa, Oklahoma, November 10th and of course, Oklahoma there and too happy about those oral or anal.

She wants to get her licks. Speaking of that, what a great segue again. The President of Loyola University in New Orleans resigned yesterday after he was accused of sexual misconduct while he was at a Jesuit prep school in Indianapolis in 1986. Well, it must be just another isolated incident, though, to that of course. The Reverend Bernard Noth, a Jesuit priest, submitted his resignation to the Roman Catholic college under new church rules that say if a sexual allegation involving a minor is deemed credible, the accused should be removed immediately if not sooner. Noth, I think we're going to fart. Oh, I just- The Hodge! Did you hear? Yeah. No, seriously. No, I didn't hear. You didn't hear. I can smell it though. Good. Oh, man. Noth, President of Loyola since 1995, he should have stated that any inappropriate conduct. The Reverend William J. Byron was named acting president. He was dean of Loyola in the 70s and writes a citricated column for the Catholic news service. Byron said that, oh, you're right. It's a thing, man. Byron said that if the allegations are approved, this is another event in a series of tragic events that comprised the greatest crisis the church has had to deal with, he said no student at Loyola's ever brought sexual allegations against Noth, a statement from the Jesuit orders Chicago, Chicago Province said the sexual and college allegedly happened at the Red Booth Jesuit prepschool. Red Booth, the Red Booth, Red Booth. Byron didn't say when a complaint was made a but apparently recently the state of Michigan, Chicago said the complaint triggered an immediate investigation. Kisland Highway Review Board which found the allegations to be credible. How do you like that? Oh, right. He done it. He done the deed. 560, 560 so far at our pool, curved stomping murder in American history, exes leading with 35 to change. So I'll see you in Scarface right on the ranch though with 31.

How about the scene in saving pride when that Nazi in the American soldier and that fight sequence in an upstairs tower? And the German soldier slowly grabs that technical hunting knife through his chest while whispering to the American to hushes if he were telling to die quietly. Why him wanted to kill him lightly? If that didn't top off, remember his friend, I see, his pussy friend, we can say that. Hiding out of the staircase crying and in the background, you hear his buddy slowly dying and gurgling blood. Oh, Mike, we got that on there. Like, yeah, not see nothing. Nazi and I can save the private run. Oh no, what is this? About Rush Limbaugh and all these how many more pages? I'm third man.

Yeah, not only people in cartoons said Eek was the Colombian chainsaw massacre. Like, boohoo. Right, there's certain there's certain expressions and sayings that nobody in real life actually says only in cartoons. Eek is one of them. Boohoo is another one. You ever say boohoo? Not lately. That's one. Everybody knows Greg Reed always says boohoo. When Eek or his name mentioned. Michael, you just have to be done for me. Just the first part. Here's a message from Tracy and Kendall. I don't know if you recall in Devolution Man when Sandra Bullock talks about the future when restaurants will all be Taco Bell and Arnold will be present. It was funny then, but it's scary now. Good point, Tracy. How about that? All restaurants will be Taco Bell's and Arnold will be present and will be wearing hip boots and goose stepping.

Feeber. Absolutely. And pumps him up. Time to pump everybody up. Don't you think? Your husbands were wives. I agenda. I thought she was incredibly impressive on the campaign. Oh, man. Well, bloodscreens. He's already. He's drinking his beer by the gallon. What a bunch of crap. Here's a fact. It says when I fetched in May about how we're doing. You said you liked him, but that it would never happen. Well, that's going to happen. Well, guess what, Kathy? A crap happens, okay? Now, she's going to say, oh, you're calling him crap. I just said crap happens. Stop being so uptight, Kathy, and have a wonderful day. Here's Aaron and Paul Middle Bay. Who rhymes with day and gay, who says I want to add the scene from Devil's Adicative Advocate where piano Reeves wife slowly slits her throw with a piece of glass. And of course, if you ladies out there were married to Canaryves, you'd probably do the same thing. The movie was very weak, but that scene left nothing to the imagination. Also, could either you or George please tell me the name for that infectious. Senior Cruz Song. Now, assume the one he's talking about is the one that goes like... Is that a lady? Is that a lady? Is that a lady? Is that a woman? Is that a woman? Is that a woman? Is that a woman? Is that a woman? Is that a woman? Is that a woman? Is that a woman? Please call a bit of it. Is that a normal Spanish? Is that a UCAR? Is that something in it? He said, please spell a bit of it. Jesus Christ, George. You and Kathy ought to be getting it on. There's something maybe you could like instill something in each other. What does she look like? Kathy? I don't even know what's the deal. I'll see the Cruz. What's the name of the song? Nanegra. I beg your pardon. Yes, she does. LA. NIGRA. Just like it sounds. That's Spanish, Ben. The shards sounds. Yeah. The shards are again. All the shards were that... What about Donna? Before after he popped... That oxies. Cotton. Here's some suggestion for today's poll. Tony and deer field says the lust murder from seven. I'm sure there are a lot. I saw seven many times. Some of these things I don't recall. Because the other... the scene where he says, What's in the box? It's overwhelms me so much. Just because it's his wife's head. Anybody saw it? I guess it is rooted for you. It's Brad Pitt's wife's head is in the box. Oh no. You just ruined it. Yeah. Don't you think it's been out long ago? No. Obviously. That's why I'm saying Bella LaGosey gets the stake through the heart and the end from the purpose of unhealsing at the end of Dracula. Hey! Yeah, but he made a lot of other Dracula who was after that. He made a Cullo. It's deeply disturbing that Maria Schraber obviously is reading an email. But they moved it too quick about ripping her an ass about becoming a turncoat and supporting her husband, Ommel. What's the fact that women I was or email? Kevin, you got that one down? What the Kevin, why did you force to do? You a girl with a huge spiked strap on? Ouch! It says, is it? It's pregnant. No, you can't just write seven. Is he gonna actually put those other ones on there or what's it deal? You'll be a lot of testing. Is he protesting? Kevin, maybe he's just eating. Kevin Dillon crushing some poor staff skull with a butt of his rifle and put two. The sound and see the blood splattering. Truly sickening is what it says. Oh, rock, that kind of movie. I never saw a platoon. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. There's so many good movies I never saw. That's what makes it good. There's so much work to do in so little times. Which is great. And I wore. Russell, Cros, two sorted the computation move in gladiator. And then Tony, who was doing really well until he got to this, how could you miss the alien pop up scene in Alien? Do we miss that? No, it's on there. So on there, it's number three and listed. It's got twenty fee vote. So get with the Tony. We're doing really well until you like a blue it. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. WQAM, hello. Mr. Rogers? C. Ski. Ski. Ski. Yeah. Your test genius brother, all they could feed up in that crazy. They made up there with the baseball bat. Baseball bat in very alive. That's on that other extended list. And then he put it on or he eventually went down. All right. Well thank you Mr. Rogers. I'm sorry. And Oscar came to you all he does. Ah, Ski. Hahaha. What did he say? They called me a CC. 560, 705, 60. Maybe I'm kind of saying Francis, you think? No. Oh. Have you know? He wasn't. How about saying Francis over here? Oh, let's do some harness racing stuff. What do you say? Okay. I should probably put on the horse racing channel. There's no harness racing at this time. We're only nine minutes away from the first race at Belmont. And horses are coming. Look at talk about psychic. The horses are coming out of the walking ring there in the paddock. And they're coming out of the track. And I've got you momentarily. We'll hear the voice of the great Tom Durkin. Old red. You think? I wouldn't know. Well, I'll just need to pop open. And then like if he's, huh? Leave it open. He'll say the horse is entering the track for the first race. And you got it. What are you going to say? Good old red. How's Harvey Pacto? And he died? Errr. He's dead. 560, 560, pound 560. Too bad about horse racing. It's really very enjoyable. Harness, stirbread, et cetera. Too bad that only old cochers like me go to it. Oh, that's the problem. There they are. Took a while. Because it was a long list. Oh, they popped up there. Oh, my God. I'm doing this to Eric. Oh, now, how did I do it? You somebody fetched this to you. And then you fetched it to me. That's the way it works when I'm out of town. And I would touch with what's going on in South Florida, quite a time jica. And by the way, speaking to that, I'm so poor, Ericka. I apologize, Eric. I don't want to ever do this to you again. The list is so freaking long. There's 170 votes. It'll probably double in over any second. Because now you've got a lot of good choices on Erick, including the one probably that many of you have been waiting for. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. But it sounds pretty good. Now, what was I just saying before you interrupted me so rudely? Tom Durkin. Oh, Tom jica. Or some other Tom Dick. And here in Tom Jerkin is Tom Jerkin probably has heard of her. Hey, Tom quit doing it. And let's hear the apostrid for the first race from Belmont Park. I don't even know if he's working today. This could be like today that I try to put Phil Salzman on there. Not yesterday, but the other day, remember? No. And he wasn't even working. Tom Jerkin ate working. Tom has worked in a Jerkin. And anyway, Tom jica's jerkin. Because Tom jica, who said that I was out of touch because of the Paul Sussafler, which of course is a jokin itself. Here's a guy that has meant a local constant before Jesus was an embryo. Man, oh man, who the hell are you? Schmidt and man, the Schmidt, myster, Tom jica. All he writes is every single day when his column appears to be a puppy. Now I shouldn't say that. Let me, I didn't look today. Because I was too honored intensive this morning. Look at about all kinds of good stuff. Bad stuff. Where the hell is it? Where is the sunset and the website, George? I don't know. Am I list of my least favorites? Oh, geez. There it is. One moment please. Okay. Of course is there why I don't hear nothing to you, hear anything? I don't hear Jack. Good. Ha ha ha ha. That's the best news I've heard all day. Okay, here's the Sun Sentinel Home page, which is for some reason. I don't know why it's so goddamn slow. Probably because it's coming from there. Columns, columns, columns. There's a embattled election supervisor, Maryam elephant. She's on there. Michael Mayon, I would, he already wrote his book, come for this year. Nice going Mike. Home movie focuses on notorious Cuban prisoners. Wow. How do you like that? This is almost a, with a south Florida flavor. There's often a disconnect between stride elements of south Florida, Scuban American, who knows from other backgrounds when it comes to anti-cuban Castro firver, which still sears almost the halfway out of El Pracito, the trip back and up explained the unwavering hatred. El Pracivio. But what does that have to do with south Florida? Just only indirectly. So that's as close. See there's my psychic powers again. How do you like that? I'm seeing these horses all over the place here. They must not have the pot opener, something on my racing channel. Because it's only six minutes the post and post times. But he had your chance time you'd go back to jerking, jerking. 560560, pound 560 on a AT&T line. WQAM, deadline. Hello. Pretty good. You know, that story you read about the, Arne, meeting with Ken Lay, Yep. You know, prompted me to call you. Greg Palis, is one of the writers for the Guardian. And he's been all over this story. I read a call by him as he yesterday or a month ago. Yeah. Great call. And Rostero was involved in that with his company called Energy Strategies. I don't know. Right. I don't know if you can. Yes, I do. And you know, something that I find amazing about all these talking heads on the gerbills news networks. Is, uh, how is it that they are trying to spin this as some kind of grade day, was our democratic conspiracy or campaign that in the last few days, all of these stories come out. When all of these stories have been out, you know, since the 90s. And this is a little bit anticlimactic though, not having this conversation at this point. Yes. Yeah. Well, I'm just talking about those and the way that they're spinning it. Yeah. It means that the whole, a lot of people that made a good point last night. And that is that Davis, who's a very inept politician to begin with, he made a really bad move on Sunday when he like started joining in with all of this and pining on to it and saying that there ought to be a criminal investigation. If he just wanted to say that he'll let the voters decide and if you would have shut up, he might have gotten some miles. Be still was going to lose his ass. I just, I can't, he's totally in that. He just blew it. I agree with you on that. He added my hand to Greg Palace to come from Friday, October, Tired Arnold, unplugged its Ostelevista, $9 billion of the governor's selected. And it's one of the best things ever read on the year was work. If you go to his website, he's got a whole series of columns that he was doing this investigation during, actually during the energy, the California rolling blackouts. Right. But my point was earlier though. What is the demonizing of the LA times of being some kind of left wing? Yeah, but that's old nose. It's over. The elections over. I know somebody will pinch you. Believe me. In your case, probably pretty soon. Somebody will pinch you. Wake up. It's over. 1256 at 5.60 WQAM. Wow. He just, I hope he has a sweet, a gay day. Speaking of that. Yeah. Why? Why don't he just, he's just a little bit hysterical at one there. I mean, his comments were good. He's a little bit. He's a little out of control since it's already old nose. It's a dead meat. Just like a great Davis dead meat. In fact, that's how you tell when like me does bad when it's great. Right? Right? Ooh. Green isn't good, but when it turns gray, oh boy. When it's out, toss it out.

As there's a scene in his film or a couple of characters get into a heat argument in a gay sex club. gay sex club. Absolutely. One of the men that uses a large fire extinguisher to beat the other man's head to a pulp. All right. Literally, blow by blow out of the force of the heavy canister. The man's head actually breaks apart. His teeth cave in. His face cracks open. His skull shatters. His brains leak out. Oh. All this happens in one unbroken shot. How the special effect was achieved is a mystery. It's the most raw, sickening act of screen violence I've ever seen. Paul is. Absolutely correct. It says if he gets a chance to see that it is available on DVD, consider yourself worn irreversible a French film. And what you see it, yes. As if that's not enough, it also contains the most horrific rapes he never seen on film. Excellent. So you can kind of let her tooper. Not there are her years. Others kind of lesbite away.
