I want to tell you a little less the sense you mentioned that it goes to sure it must be on psychic wavelength Yesterday it was out shopping at my a little supermarket airbuck to block away and at the you know They always put these At the counter they put these what do they call those things to catch your eye Impulse bindings so they had these all these little boxes of like hard candies and of course when you're fat You're always on a diet. You're always trying to find something that's sweet, but doesn't have any carbs, you know And it said no sugar and it had no sorbet's help. I had something called isomalt Right and it were like about 20 of these raspberry little around hard candies delicious great tasting You know just something a suck out if I can say that and I brought them home and of course with them I'm sitting watching TV with an hour two. I have sucked on all 20 or 30 of these Maybe it was a third man. He's a little candy. I'm gonna tell you something between five and 17 M last night I must have been the business man in a province of Ontario. I can't even get the scrub it to you You know it's so funny what you said about Joe and Mark show Joe has talent is a funny guy I agree with you and but he he programs to the wrong age you program to the 18 heroes I totally agree Mark Eisenberg on the other hand. Yeah, is the guy his it's hard to believe How first of all stubborn he is okay really Neil he is the biggest piece of crap I your life number one Yeah, not even close. I'm telling you you should listen to this show No, he wants everybody in jail for he's the thought please to this please the guy is a Nazi and Even Joe who has the oldest tongue mr. Diplomat He would stab him in the back fatally there'd be more blood in your studio Believe me it would make the bottle looks like a no leave like a pike or okay Thank you to that was my totally this was gonna be great George you have so little faith man These have been this group has been one of the best much as a cause because Huh this is great today. I'll give him was great well I'm not gonna say it's ever gonna happen again But you know you just keep doing it for 100 years and sooner or later you hit the jackpot. Don't jinx it This was good you hit the pot This 22 foot story how do you measure this another guy that says Mark Eisenberg is see the word that comes to mind I'm gonna try to be diplomatic because he's not a bet. I don't think why do I always say that? I'm doing the same thing like that woman whoever the call or was it said you know you're boring, but you're not a bad guy How do I know Mark Eisenberg's a nice guy? I don't know I? I've laid my eyes on his fat puggie body a total maybe three minutes in a whole time that he's been on the station I don't see him. I don't know from him. I'll say it. He's a nice guy. Okay I'll agree with you. He's a nice guy But the word that comes to mind is doored D-U-L-L-A-R-D doored Okay, okay, which you can relate to that little bit, but I mean I mean by comparison You're like a whirling dervish. You're like a Mexican jumping being in heat compared to exactly just like that compared to To Mark Eisenberg he's boring. He's his terminal and did I say that way back in the beginning? I was be moaning the fast and Joe Costello. Why have you teamed up with his guy first of all? What do you need to have the guy you're only on now for three hours anyway two to five in a morning? Right, we're not gonna get any calls. You need something somebody That was that Was that that what we're gonna come from? Shark I oh my god that was Mark Eisenberg even his laugh could put you into a coma. That was Let's listen to that That was that was shocking that was scandalous when I went man I want you to play that Get you know give it pause here. I want you to play it again Nice step on it one more time Because I because I taped it right there. I want to make sure I put it in my D. I got to hand that my D.C. Yes No, seriously no In fact just to be on the safe side. I wanted one more moment please folks bear with me to do this on the air I want to make sure I got it extra special One more time See there you go. I got it That exciting we got Mark Eisenberg with a laugh of a doldard If it's small potatoes you know it's overnight, but of course it's another good excuse Moe can blame them like he already has in the past these sandwich between C.V. 4 he was sandwiched between Two non sport shows now he's got his buddy Ferrell on there who does the was sports show after a fashion Did he cook so we can't blame him anymore so all it could say is he's feeling so badly So desperately because he's following a non sport show meaning Joe and Mark okay Now how can you blame an overnight show and in fact that you got like these Minusual horrendous numbers early in a morning and then you're so desperate that you have people calling Could you imagine us ever doing that On our most desperate days and believe me we've had plenty of them Yeah, can you imagine inviting the audience to call in and suck our ass and then tell us how much they like us and Everybody else sucks. I'd rather shoot myself. Hey, well, I'd rather shoot you too, right? I'd rather let you But I mean what what kind of kaka is that talk about desperation kaka? Although he did have a great line mode this morning we did the crossover with Scott at the eight o'clock here at a sensation line Can you believe I had one color colon and tell me that I suck this morning? I didn't hang up on him and you know something maybe he's got a point Maybe I do suck and I thought to myself Now you're talking more You're making some sense first honest thing you said the whole time he's been on a radio station You're in a half almost now is that he sucks Am I getting all whipped up again?

are a bunch of more ons out there and this is what America has become what you really has fine what do we what do we care it's not going to get a bar asked right tell the week give a crap about California screw on parade we got uh what is it was 153 but I think it wound up like 190 something by the time they finished and then they had to draw the love was like they would do in the lottery to pick up the letters to say well like I know this is a revolutionary concept but why can they just put them an alphabetical order when that we all know favoritism to the people that have a blessed with an A in their name as opposed to you know the Arnold who has a you know an ass and so it has to be random because people are going to be drawn towards the top names and done at an internet I mean he

I don't know if I'm waiting here. I'm going to give up. Oh, isn't this real? No, I don't think it is. Right in here. Yeah, you know why I'm trying to act? Yeah. Like I'm sounding like that. Yeah, look at all this. I'm not back dad, what's hot? But that is not where we are. That is ridiculous. From Elizabeth Taylor, the woman who first brought you the fragrance white diamonds. I'm back with the sensual number for hours. Elizabeth Taylor presents white. The essence white castle. The essence of myths and melons and pickles. It's a sack of scent you'll never forget. Elizabeth Taylor's white castle. All my men love white castle. Under the sheets. A fragrance that lingers on and on and on. Maybe longer than you'd like. Elizabeth Taylor's white castle. Live white castle. Love white castle. Eat white castle. Where white castle? From Elizabeth Taylor. In six-hour models. Or by the sack. Are you suffering from a rectal dysfunction? Real man's just not what it used to be. Really? Man. What up, fuzzy? What a whim. You got to be kidding. You mean to tell me you're just hanging a droopy prune? Wow. You're a scissy. You're not even gay. You're beyond gay dude. What do you have someone lift his spoon of coin flakes for you in the morning? Let's raise it. If you really need this stuff, you're not a man at all. I mean, how many men actually need this garbage? Really? Anybody who buys peanuts in hand. There's just wants to get bigger in state at way overnight. That's all. There's no real medical use for it. Unless you're a swishie, was. What do you offended? Hey, we're a pharmaceutical company. We can do any goddamn thing we want now. Any sh**. We got on a shelf. We'll make you think you need it. And guess what? You're so f**king stupid. I can say all this. And you'll still run to your doctor for a script. Oh man, what a loser. Probably your public. All the lay girls. Everyone wants in on candidates. See. The candidate who protects school. And the guy who thinks that's women's ball. You keep their hopes and dreams alive. When the cook who works down at the bank, through the cloud and screen true septic take, they have a shot to grab it all. If the governor falls in the ball. And one, give it place for the day they've passed. For God to be blamed, man. Don't gotta be blamed, man. For honey, then it's a problem. The dirty bunch of kids. Nothing to stop them. You won, f**k. Right after one hundred one thing for move from the human body, it's one hundred one thing for move from Richard Simmons. On park. What are you guys? Wow. Watch out for it. Watch out for it. Watch out for it. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? After a hard day of flowering sugargain, the fastest way of importing it to the states is with a tough Chevy truck. That looks like a bull. And you thought the propellers were a game? It can't stop the water! With Cuban engineering, it would take the coastline to sink a tough Chevy truck. It would sink a full round of the world in a frostbicycle. You can have 10 times Chevy trucks to get the tough jobs done, even if they have the float. I gave both! About time, the publication, the concept that's special, they're likely to be. This is what's like a full spot. My enemy, be jettless. Bebless, any be mean to me. There, there ain't nothing like taking a dip in some manhole. I'll just take just a chuck these chunks here. My bull could use a little vitamin C. Hey, hey, hey, what kind of boat is this? My hell of a black ain't this? No! I'm dressed! I have to get going here! What's the matter? You can't you see? Yeah, my mate, you should! I know, but listen, you know, we want to help me here. So, you see, you can't get to get a knowledge under his tutelage, huh? Well, actually, I was not asked yet. You're not going to get under my tutelage, you're going to get to your tutelage.
