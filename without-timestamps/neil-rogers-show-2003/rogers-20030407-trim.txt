As you see, K.S. A.R. A.R. They love Barry, baby. They don't want anybody to know, but they love Barry with a shun. My name is Barry. Sing like a Barry. I write Bansons about romance. While I'm wearing Spend X-Tac, I'm trying to shrimp me. My songs are wippy. I had a series of big hits. But that was back in 76 now, no one wants to hit. They only laugh and scare. They won't hit. They owe my albums for my songs. We're got a nose shape. Like a banana. By two fans both live in my town. I'll eat. Got a nose shape. Like a banana. Of my nose you can fit half of the city of Atlanta. Pretty big. I write the songs. I write the songs. I go to the neighborhood. I've got a hug. The size of y'all. Very good. When I get a stop, the nose, I be interested in a host. But now on the case, my life is back in place. And so I'm singing again and sticking. My shn eyes in your face. Got a nose shape. Like a banana. Everybody. Like two fans both live in my town. Got a nose shape. Like a banana. Oh. Of my nose you can fit half of the city of Atlanta. I write the songs. They'll be in anyway. Carlos is alive. Peter Boy and the other one. David George is on vacation. Oh, what a relief. That's how much that you're in there just that George isn't. Not that I don't like George a lot. But he's, you know, you need to rest from George every now and then. Like, you know, every couple of weeks. Anyway, 903 at 5.60 WQAM. Great weekend. Was there a great weekend or what? Well, that's what Muff said. He said to hit a wonderful weekend. Okay. And then my weekend was okay except we decided to go to the Panther game yesterday. Oh my god. Woo, woo, get me out of there. Get me out of there. When it's fiscal, what in there like thought I'm being like that, we got out real quick. And a guy that sits at front of me, I sure hope next season you're not there, man. You bug me. He's such a jerk. He's a jerk. He's just a jerk. And then he starts him with a war stuff. All I did, I didn't want to get into the conversation. And I said, you see that David Bloom died over there in Iraq, which by the way, we'll talk about that. What a good guy he was. I was very upset with all that. And I'm still upset about his embedded crap. Right. And there's one more reason to be upset about it. These guys aren't the troops. They're, they're slupping around in these kind of boys with all that heavy equipment on. And, you know, and they're out there in the desert for hours and days on end. And this is what creates that deep ban thrombosis. Not that I'm an expert except that I just had it myself two months ago. 39 years old. Magic, tragic waste of human life. And that's what's unfolding over there, but I'll get into that eventually. So what was I just saying? Well, about the hockey game. Oh, and the jerk that sits in front of me, you bug me, man. Go away. Just go away. You're little kids okay, because he shuts up, but get you go away. Now, and he gets into a whole song that a dance about Peter, I'm not what you didn't know. Even though his name didn't even know what the hell he said. And then he finally comes up with a definitive sunrise Jewish response. Well, isn't it a damn good thing that Israel didn't get involved in this? And I said, well, Israel's a big part of the reason that whole thing is going on. And boy, you would have thought that I just took a crap on his shoulder. In fact, you know, something if he does show up next year, I might just, no, I won't take a crap on his shoulder. I'll just take the hose for my bag and flip it over on his shoulder. Yeah, I'll borrow the bag from both. There you go, pal. Go away. You idiot. God, he bugs me. See, one thing I'll tell you folks, don't get into discussions about the war and public not a good idea. Right. Especially with people, you don't know where they're coming from. I didn't see what I'm saying. Don't bring this up as a topic of conversation like boys and they're ashamed that all these people are done. And as I said, they're in that macarine and the midst of a grotesque, you know, it's not a hockey game anymore. It's a circus. It's a circus. There was a big crowd of yesterday about 8 or 10,000 flyers fans. But it's not a hockey arena. It's a circus. And they had the harp music going on so that you'd look up, while a game is going on. I guess it was to try to distract you from the fact that we're getting the crap out of us by a team that held our stars on a bench. Nice going, Randy of what else is named, Red deer Randy. Randy with the moers. He tapes the pregame little thing that they put up on the screen. The Panther keys to victory containing Tony, a body and Jeremy Roanick. Well, I can say they're pretty well because they either want to complain. Yeah, they're going to mourn the lineup. Nice going there, Red deer Randy. You idiot, you silly. What a silly clown you are, Randy. God, no wonder they stuck in there with the old jugs, myster. Fect you, my jug sound great. Hang in there, jugs. Don't let Gellie steal your jug next to your okay, we're pulling for you. Spide of your hostility toward Toronto's goody. Road your ass out of town on a rail, you silly old fag goose. But anyway, yeah, the keys to victory were keeping them off the score sheet. Did either want them score? No. Did either want them play? No. They've got a race kicked. I mean bad. But anyway, so there are all these people in there. I would say I saw maybe 20 of the regular people that you were nearly with seeer and who the rest of those people where I have no idea. I have no clue. And they're making announcements while the game is going on and hey, Mochi, Pupic in the third row and 102, just want a date with Pavel Burrea. I mean, he didn't even play here anymore. Just, Paka, this garbage. It was, it was bad. I have no idea. And you read these puff pieces in the newspapers here. And you think that if we had anybody with a half a brain, they'd be saying, for this franchise is in deep crap. There's some real heavy duty garbage going on in this time. And they just write the same old Sunday morning. David J. Neel, the same old, shill man, the same old tired crap. God, is he pathetic? Oh, yeah, we really made some progress this year. Yeah, we sure did. I mean, you sure can't expect to go from 60 points last year to play off spot this year. Could you? Sure you could. Look at 10. How many points did Tampa be increased about? I don't know. I don't know the exact number, but they sure had a big increase from last year. God, third man. Yeah, something like that. 93 points. The youngsters in the organization, right. If they could win a game or two, it'll hope. Are you starting in? Sorry. You just sat down there and you're starting in already. 141 votes on the pool from, oh, the weekend. That's an off-dory. OK, no, no, no, no, no. Which celebrity music TV radio or movies do you enjoy? But you'd never admit it. Very man, low 25. Oh, why? In fact, somebody over the weekend said to me, oh, yeah, I really enjoy very man-alone. And I thought you actually said that? Well, somebody I know, you know. But they actually said it. There was nobody else listening. Second, amazingly. I mean, our shocker here. You could just knock me down with a feather. Well, we're nearly, I guess you could. George Rodriguez, 171, a very respectable second place. So George Ashley has more people out there who enjoy him, but he's not, it's not palatable. It's not acceptable to say that in public. Jorge, little hoor, oh, no. You don't really enjoy a little hooray there. A little big, big bass dude. Yeah. No, I was just kidding. Eminem 125. I can understand that. No, I actually can't understand what anybody would like him. Abba 112. Yeah, everybody does like their music, but nobody will want to admit it, because it's a little, I don't know. Discoish. Neorodges 110. I like that number. That's good. Wait, 61 votes George meet beat me out by. Because we know for a long time. I got a big closet audience out there, but George is closet people, man, far outpace me by like a three to two. Michael Jackson 76, the BG75. You see a pattern developing here? Boy, George 66 is the pattern continues. Oh, how are David in 63? I wonder what pattern that is? Maybe the pattern of those checkered pants. George Michael 58 is we get back to it. The back three boys, 50, Barber Streisand 43, B52's 36, in Stink 33. John for Holta and Yani and Leo de Craprio 31, tied Ricky Martin 27, kiss 24. You guys are kiss? Richard Gear 14, John Sukade 11, holding up the rare and the rare. Right, though, was John Tesh with eight. Was a famous penis. John Tesh, boy, he makes me just cringe about life in general. 14, everyone votes not too bad, heavy duty. As we brought a lot of people out of the closet, with people to see him, we're going to trace all of the votes. And tomorrow's sure we're going to like to give you names, addresses and phone numbers of people that voted for Barry Manlow. And George. I got an article here. I'm going to read the one that I put the big mark on, save about the Carlisle group. I think if people would just read this article, let's all they need to see. They don't need to see or hear or read anything else to tell them what all of this is all about. David Bloom a really good guy at WTVJ for our years. It seems like he was only here in town yesterday. He was here, you know, great guy. Very sad. I did just a waste of a human life. Great talent. Everybody who worked with him liked him. I, I meant him once. He actually listened to this show once upon a time when he was here. I know that, that's supposed to say that. But he just was a good guy. And a very good talent. Had a big bright future ahead of him. And he's a deep, fainter on post this man. Inactivity sitting there with all that heavy equipment on. Blood clock goes to the lung. That's it. Do you realize how many hundreds of thousands of people get that? And I think it's 200,000 year in this country die from that every year. Die, not pulmonary embolism. It blocks off the lungs and the oxygen to your brain, stop, so do your heart or whatever. And that's it. And it's fatal in most cases. No. No. No. But it can be. That's the point. Especially the little bit of integrity. You know something, I'm going to take a couple extra of platyx right now. In fact, I'm just swallowing a whole bottle right now just to be on the safe. No, seriously, it's nasty stuff. But you know the Lord works in mysterious ways. So I started to say, I was, oh, we got a ball game today. Oh, no, the Marlins and the Braves at 1230. Got her. We upset about that. No. No, we're not. What's Monday? Plus look at these phones, man. They're smoking. Aren't they smoking? Woo. But I was thinking I'm at the hockey game yesterday. And I see all these, they're a lot of kids there, which is good. Get the kids up for, you know, hockey. But I see these parents with their little kids. And I was wondering myself, you think any of these parents would be willing to sacrifice their children for somebody that would invade us and say, hey, we're here to liberate you. And by the base, they're going to go their heads getting blown off right in front of your face. I wonder what their reaction would be. I know it's a horrible thing. But if that thought did enter my mind. Because their children are no different from those little Iraqi children. And I'm not trying to sound like hearts and flowers. But there's no difference. Accident of birth is all that separates us from them. It's called the wrong place at the wrong time. Problems that it's after you're on nine at five, 60 WQA.

WQAM. WQAM. Hey, I got a full question for Neil. Okay. Hey, which arena should the hockey play in to the planet of American Airlines? The arena is to the play in for loader.

I'm just being honest with it Flyers didn't even look like they were interested. I mean, just one of those deals here's the last game of the season They can't move up in the standies can't move down Just don't get anybody injured. That's it. Let's get out here. They had no interest and then all of a sudden to start as soon as they scroll to first school It's like hey guess what now? Let's put pump up a few more in there Just tragic It's the same old crap in the newspapers here. It's never gonna change. It's not gonna change. Don't get all the press knee. Okay, won't God anyway This is from the Portugal weekend newspaper the Portugal news. I want you to listen very carefully Of course we got a big segment out there. We're paying attention to what anyway. That's okay. I'm gonna read it anyhow I'm just reading it over and over again U.S. Arms group heads for Lisbon Directors of one of the world's largest armament companies are planning on meeting in Lisbon in three weeks time The American based Carlisle group has heavily involved in supplying armament to the coalition forces fighting in the Iraqi war It also holds a majority of shares in these seven up company in the federal data corporation Supplier of air traffic control surveillance systems to the U.S. federal aviation authority The 12-bit-end dollar company is recently signed contracts with the United Defense Industries to equip the Turkish and Saudi Arabian armies With aviation defense systems Compatement meetings agenda is expected to be the companies involved in the rebuilding of Baghdad's infrastructure after the cessation of courthouse stilllies Along with several other U.S. companies the Carlisle group has expected to be awarded a billion dollar contract by the U.S. government to help an immediate development of airfields and urban areas destroyed by coalition aerial bombardments The group has managed by a team of former U.S. government personnel including its president Frank Carlucci Formidia a deputy director of the CIA before becoming defense secretary his deputy is James Baker the tooth who was secretary Is dead under George Bush senior member James Baker was down here. Let us in play who is a heading up the recounting when a story election Several high-profile former politicians are employed to represent the company overseas among them former British Prime Minister John Major Along with George Bush senior one-time director of the CIA before becoming U.S. president The financial assets of the Saudi bin Laden corporation SBC are also managed by the Carlisle group The Saudi bin Laden corporation the SBC is headed up by members of the Osama bin Laden family who played a principal role in helping George W. Bush When petroleum concessions from Bahrain when he was head of the Texan oil company Harkin energy corpidilla was to make the bush family millions of dollars Salem Osama's Some of Bin Laden's brother was represented on Harkin's board and directors by American agent James our bath I think that paragraph is worth reading again The financial assets of the Saudi bin Laden corporation SBC are also managed by the Carlisle group The SBC is headed up by members of Osama bin Laden's family who played a principal role in helping George W. Bush When petroleum concessions from Bahrain when he was head of the Texan oil company Harkin energy corp A deal that was to make the bush family millions of dollars Salem Osama bin Laden's brother was represented on Harkin's board and directors by his American agent James our bath The connection between the Bush and bin Laden families can also be traced to the collapse of the bank of credit and Commerce International BB's BCCI in the 1990s Members of the Anglo-Pakestani bank's board of directors included Richard Helms and William Casey Business partners of George Bush senior and former CIA director agents During their time at BCCI both Helms and Casey worked alongside fellow director Eddon Kashoggi who also represented the bin Laden's families interest in the US The Portugal news has been told by a reliable source that the Carlisle group meeting in Los bin will discuss a relationship between the Saudi bin Laden corporation SBC and Osama bin Laden Many US officials claim that the SBC continues to finance his beloved activities and is done so for many years If through this would place George Bush senior and his colleagues at the Carlisle group in an embarrassing position as Managers of SBC's financial investments they might well be accused of indirectly eating and abetting the United States Number one enemy this was in the Portugal news this past weekend I just I just mentioned it and passing you understand, okay? Not for any particular reason not because I think there might be some people out there with an IQ larger than the thumb Who might want to know what's really going on in the world, but it's really all about as opposed to this USA you all this other bull crap Rivery said tragic is what it is what's that got there besides food, huh?

right wingers in his real and about the dergo to be two of the guy already i had that article for you last week April one and it was no fooling u.s. draws up secret plan with post regime on a rack from the uh guardian newspaper in England a disagreement's broken out of the senior level within the bush of administration over a new government that the u.s. is secretly planning and quate to rule a rack in the immediate aftermath of the overthrow of goddam sottam under the plan the government will consist of 23 ministries each headed by an american uh and of course it says this is done the government's composition appear to be entirely in u.s. hands especially those of Paul wolfowitz the deputy secretary of defense you understand the stop-out in strack of everyone this is an original garner was officially in charge but according to sources posted the planning of the government has had to accept another controversial iraqis and advisory rules so in other words Paul wolfowitz and his henchmen are putting all of this together i wonder how these two uh puppets of aerial sharon are going to get along with the iraqis uh and it's going to be a mess i don't want to even predict the gloom and do but it's going to be unpleasant okay they're not going to be too crazy about that you might mention my name's a rice mash of garner w q a m good morning a good man how are you i'm pretty

I'll tell you many life with her, he can't stand. We'll now be checking inside the pen. Do I have to? Or am I fool? Take down that coin. So, I ain't got things don't have any ball. That's why they slap each other's chin. Don't ball, don't hurt me. I don't. Oh. 1047 we got big balls here at QM where we're radio-ish. That's right. Donna shall I let Eddie Jones their real upset about that billboard? What was ever the end result of that, do we know? No. I think we just have like two teams left up there on that billboard. Now that Moe's back from his re-facation, I'm here and I think it's true that they actually take in two of his here pieces and they replace the UAM and the dolphin logos and I won't build board on 441. Huh? That's what I'm here and all and I forgot to wear my Iraqoon cat there. Tomorrow morning I think when I come in I'm going to stick that over the top of my head just standing in the window and pier it my close personal friend in here. Here's the facts from somebody. Yesterday made the horrible mistake of taking my nine year old son to the Panthers game. Oh, you're right that you could have quit right there was a horrible mistake. At the end of the second period after seeing a fairly good team without its stars is to wear a minor league club. We finally left but now without great parting gifts, I set a drumsticks. What the hell kind of marketing is that my son loved him as he beat me over the head with him from the back seat of the car on the way home? Screaming at me that we should have gone to the hurricane's baseball game next time I listen to the kid. By the way, we met Rimmer during the first in a mission he said that he always buys. And I'm glad he mentioned that he reminded me because Rimmer's wife didn't want me to put it on the year. He lives on a golf course. Now that the season is over, no playoffs many, many months of an activity. In a spare time he puts on his little bathing suits, swims across the lake to the golf course. Find all the airy things. He's hiding with the thing about we got balls. Finds the golf balls. And on the front right outside of the front yard got a big sign. Bucca Holler. Where was you ball? You better be kidding. No, he saw him use golf balls. Firstly, well, at least he washes his balls off. Not in the sink either like you. Oh, okay. Sorry that I had to tell out in the air for a little bit. It's a true star. Well, you know, times of tough. Plus he only gets 50% off into pizza loft. Do you realize that this man wanted me to go to intercede on his behalf? When Jeff is there, he gets freebies. But when Jeff is not there, he's in the computer for 50% off. Pay the money. Okay, remember you cheap bastard. You cheap Canadians who bastard, okay? Good. Got all money. What kind of cheapness is that it got a 3.5 million dollar house? Why don't you go back to Canada to you, too fast to write? Back to Montreal where they claim it you came from. Even though you're from Toronto. Hey, us in Toronto, we don't want to admit it. Spare some change, Mr. Oh, I'd like to see him in Toronto downtown. But all the homeless people. Spare some change, Mr. Watch him open a wall and let him off fly out right in her post. He's a panic. 567560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless blind. Come on out, okay. Let's get broke on here. What do you say? I'm taking the rest of the week off. We're going to put the battling broke on here. No, you love working with her. Don't even like listening to her. Maybe she'd even do her little boxy or ball of wax deal. W to Q AM? Yeah, hi, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm sure I'm already. Oh, yeah. You know, I'm not a big Bill O'Reilly fan, but I read his column in Saturdays page. Oh, I'm sorry. About the slaughter. Yeah. He was talking about how he got an email supposedly from a colonel from the third infantry, when it was saying that we're making history with destroying two Iraqi divisions. Everyone is getting a chance to kill somebody. We've killed over 10,000 Iraqi soldiers and body parts on knee deep. I saw something like this on C-SPAN II, an ITN reported reporting it, who was abruptly cut off on Saturday as well. And what I've heard from, I don't even watch on news. The news that we have here, these channels CNN and all. Because they said, what 500 Iraqis dead in about 80 Americans, it seems like it's very easy. But you said a couple of weeks ago. There are numbers on a piece of paper, just statistics. Yeah. How lateral damage? Yeah, you know what was funny. You talk about that, how it's just numbers on paper, like with me, with a lot of folks down here with David Bloom. But I don't know when he soldiers in there. Right. And you saw a heinous at, oh my God, that's like someone, you know, we know in a way. And he was neither in combat. No, no, he wasn't. But clamped up in that hungry. You know, did like he's right. You know, that's what they're meant, you know. And, you know, that's a shame. I mean, and I'm sure there's so many people. What did he die for? I mean, granted he was a great news guy and he wanted to be there and wanted to cover the thing. But what did he die for? What did he give away his life to accomplish? Absolutely nothing in that sense. I mean, you know, you go there to report a story. I mean, it's a little bit different in covering the aftermath of a hurricane or a flooding of a river where you're sitting there. And here you're putting your life, you know, on the line. And like you just said, for nothing. You know, and that was it. But you mentioned a couple weeks ago about the slaughter that was going on. And there was absolutely nothing. Nothing that you could find about what's really going on there. And I was surprised to find it on an old Rylee column. And, you know, about what's really going on. And Americans, you know, I mean, there's 70% of them that have their head head in the sand, they get. And they just don't want to know. And just one last thing. I don't before you go on. I always used to wonder as a kid, especially. How it is that the German people followed Hitler. And I see a lot of similarities here. They'll just go step in line. They love every second of it. We're superior to everybody else. We're going to kick all our enemies ass and the sighe island and the 70% of the American public are buying to that mentality. Absolutely. And like you said, you know, liberation by a women age. Right. I saw those pictures too of the soldiers with that family. We had the guns pointed at some family. And that was scary. And yeah, they were terrified. They were shaking like leaves. And it's just so bizarre. But you know, the defense contracts are being wind up. There's a lot of people, a lot of companies that stand to make a lot of money. You know, that's your man. And that was it. You know, I went to an impact. One of the stories on our website today that checkered past of US firms in the frame, Krony said to make a killing by the London observer. Krony said to make a killing. Absolutely. One last thing. I don't know about the on a different note. This saying you had last week. I think there was one. There's more than one way to skin a cat. I wouldn't have been good. Yeah, I don't know how many ways you need. We'll do it again one day. You know, like tomorrow. Okay. Never ever raped it. 560, 560, pound 560. Now Eric never finds me to resolve that pull. I know he's got it. He's probably busy. He's looking for it. I talked to him. Okay. Didn't I just don't the two of you get started again? I don't want to know. Why did you call him? Because if you'd speak to him, then there's going to be a little friction. You know, you're going to be like, uh, Oh, he had a hurt you though. Why? He had a hurt you. He hadn't? He had it. He had it. He had not. He had not hurt it. Why? Why? What's he doing? Listen to, uh, what's the doctor? Laura? Of course. I always knew it about him. He's not fooling me. Listen to the doctor. Laura up there. She's probably called me a communist again today. That bitch. That nasty miserable, right wing orthodox Jew bitch. You know, who should be a good mate for Jew Lieberman? I'd like to see the two of them in low. Not seriously. And they could both wear it on their sleeve. Ooh. I'd like to do something on their sleeve. Yeah. Big pile. So is that a ton of Cleveland clinic? I'm going to go over to Dr. Laura's house and go in and fight Jew Lieberman for a nice co-sher lunch and I'm going to take a dump and smear it on both of them. And then I'm going to smear whatever leftover in every flesher's bald spot. I don't know. Maybe it's a hockey game yesterday. Just kind of like putting me in a sour mood. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T. I'd tell you one thing that pulled over the weekend. George, I don't know whether that's good or bad. He came in second place to bury a manalo. I guess it's bad. Because if they're bears to say it, that means that they're bears to say it. They enjoy his work. Right. But they're embarrassed to say it. It's as opposed to saying he sucks on the ear or something like which we've already done those pulls. Let's do that again while he's going this way. Why do you think George sucks on? No, we're not going to do that. We're not going to pick on George when he's not here. I enjoy it more when he is here to pick on him. He gets all defensive. He is so, oh, thin skin, man. He pretends that he's not. Do you think that haven't done this now for five years on an off-film and everything? You know, after you do few shows that thin skin goes away, not him. Wow. You still find a button here and there. You could see his button. Man, even an elevator in an AT story building, I have as many buttons as he's got. Wow. Right away, don't touch the buttons in the other ear. You can get SARS. Wash your hands real good with soap under the nails, huh? They don't know. They're just talking to Kakka. They don't know. If you really wanted to scare the crap out of the public, there's an article. I don't want to say what it is. I'm not going to talk about it, huh? I don't want to give you right it. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. I'm a prison planet about SARS. I don't want to say that the guy's a little, I mean, maybe he's right. But I'm not going to talk about it here on the ear. As a matter of, now I could say it today. Remember what I said before the year I show about 9-11? I don't want to say that yet because it's just, I can't bring myself to say it yet. I may have to apologize to a lot of people of cold in the last year and a half on the show. Not yet, though, because I think they may be a little over the top, a little, you know, I don't want to say it yet. Maybe tomorrow. 10-56-560 WQMIA sensational Monday. I don't know what it is. Must have been that hockey game in the lady in the beginning. I got me in such a good mood. Maybe we'll see in remember after the game. After the last movie, left the game in the middle of the second period. He was waiting right outside there after he scored the fifth goal. I guess he knew we'd be flying out of there. We were. And he has hand out. I haven't even spared change at the moment. He has hand out. He had a little tin cup. I don't know if I forgot to ask him what he was doing out there. A little tin cup. I'm in a collection for the pace and real salary. And I loved that thing in the column yesterday. But, oh, well, we're not going to pay any, get anybody new next year. I'm going to pay any big salaries. Huh? What? Wow. Liberation by elimination. That's what we're doing at the macarena. We're eliminating him like crazy. Pay those gigantic prices to come in and see all the youngsters in the organization. The ones that we can afford to keep here. And, of course, the really good ones are going to be going someplace else. Good. Gawling this money. I don't want to get an Allen Cohen's case. Okay? Because, you know, he'll be deserves it. Big time. He's got a lot of people suckered in and all these columnists to just, they're lackeys. He's going to make any difference. Who's running the organization? They just rub right at the same old crap. And old number eight was out there. Actually, he compared the rest of the team he played pretty good yesterday. Through a couple of really wild wicked hits. I mean, I can't say a whole lot for him, at least he did something. Right, Pete? Come on, Pete. Hit somebody. The lies put in Florida. Yes. Yes. Yes. The cause is just. And our mission is clear. To desire a rock of weapons and mass destruction. To answer the only saying support for terrorism. And to free it here I do people. All the things that stand on the thickest end. Tell me where they had them. We go the hands down... We go the hands down... All the things that stand on the thickest end. Tell me where they had them. They're gonna hand down... We go the hands down... It's a job that's done. I'd die... It's a job... That's done. American and coalition forces facing enemies who have no regard for the conventions of war. A rules of morality. Iraqi officials have placed troops in equipment in civilian areas, a tempting queues innocent men, women and children, as shields for the decadeers army. The one Americans in all the world know that coalition forces will make every effort, despair in this incident for harm. It is a fight for the security of our nation and the peace of the world. And we will accept no outcomes. But victory. 11. On Friday, 5. 60. W.M. Here's the fact that since David Bloom was a blessing and is an alternative to the showtime, SuperPetral American Idol mentality of newsrooms today. He has seen the fact that this one notices one of our regular facts. He's going to be upset with me when I make my comment. He says he and Sully died where we all professionals. You know, Sully, that'll Brian. Binbet. It was a real pleasure to watch them do real news program on Saturdays. They were easily a better duo in all senses. A real chemistry more sexy, more charming again, much more professional than the Matt and Katie Act ever dreamed of being. Well, they're more sexy, doesn't it sound like American Idol? Huh? I see, I know this this fact, so that makes me a little bit nervous because David Bloom was great. He's doing what he was like goofing around on the weekend today. Sure, whether he was being like a recourse bond like he did from wherever. No matter what, the hurricane anywhere he was. But Sully, that'll Brian. Oh, my God. You've got to be kidding me, okay? Binbet Central. And say, I hear she got turned down to Binbet Central. Two over the top. 5. 6. 705. 60. What we got to have Marlon and a Braves game in 1230? Let's do a lot more of those. Starting at about 10. 15 sounds good to me. Let's play a little small ball. We got Carlos here for that small. I'm sorry. And then we got remember where the golf balls for you. We got that master stuff all week on. They're going to be hooking about that in the month of Birkit about whoody in your Johnson. Oh, God. Give it a rest, Mo. Okay. It is so boring already. It was kind of a tit titlating for a little while there, but Jesus, God. And also there a bunch of blue nose Yahoo, good old boys up there. They don't know about no broads in there. They don't want no fags. They don't want those spokes in there a long time ago. But then they had a, you know, I, it's just that one year if the same thing were being said about black people being excluded from it. Yeah, it will be like saying, but you know, all those other people didn't want Rosa Parks at the front of the bus. Well, tough crap. She made her point. She made a stand. And yet, there were more important things that black people had to worry about that back then about who was going to sit where on the bus. But nevertheless, you have to attack in all areas. And all the excuses that the, that the old, hooting hoodies like, well, that's what he is. He's a hooting hoody Yahoo, I can see him with a big hood on his head. You know, I can, yeah, seriously, at least to cover up that damn piece that raccoon, a big, big pointed hood on his head. I can see it right now. Up there when I gust it with those all those old nasty, miserable, Arnie Palmer and Nicholas, Gary, play, you can smell a guy damn to jam coming from there. Right, um, oh, geez. Bruno's is. That's what golf saw about. We don't want no bras in here, it's pulling our fun. And of course, anytime I hear a guy saying something like that, we don't want no bras in here, you know what that is. That's a deep club you moron. That's right. Just like remember when they started having a broad reporters in locker room? Yeah, they can't be naked. Oh, we don't want no women in the locker. They might see a penis. Woo! And there's a few things in the world more hysterically, the women just goes nuts over a flasad penis, right? Right, a flasad penis? I don't want, I'm not going to delve into that. Okay, because I know you're going to take this just like George's trained you. What's obvious to me, this is the moment you've been waiting for. George has trained you very well to just pick your opening so to speak and jump right in with something really grow Ted, we're not going to be doing that today or tomorrow or Wednesday, maybe next week someday if I like decide to call and sick like Monday would be good. WCUIM. R.L. R.L. Yeah, this is R.L. 5.670560. How come we don't get it that he's not going to be on again? Ever. It's just, it's real simple. There's like a little yellow button here and you just disappear like so like the asshole, let you are. You won't be on this show again. Don't you get it. Don't you understand it? Huh? Which words don't you understand? Can't you fathom it? No. You jack as you. Man is he pathetic. See now George gets upset about that guy, not me. I kind of enjoy him. WCUIM. Yes, good morning. I'd like to speak with you. Speaking. Neil, good morning. How you doing? Very well. Thank you. I really just wanted to thank you for mentioning that family this morning because I will tell you what, I couldn't finish my breakfast after I saw that. I mean, I wonder how many of these people who are gone home for this war were like to have, you know, a bunch of soldiers come to their house and force everybody at gunpoint to come out and terrorize it. Neil, that little girl is going to be scarred for life. And I was, you know, relating that story to some of my lesson-lightened coworkers this morning who still buy into all the schmit that is being fed to them by the media. And you know, not that I needed an excuse, but now I'm more determined than ever that I've just got to get out of this country. And I was wondering because I heard you mentioned a few weeks ago, you were talking about places that people would like to visit that they hadn't been to. Right. And I've never heard you mention Stockholm and I was wondering if you were there. It's a beautiful city. It's a wonderful place. I've been there. My head was there. A lot of drugs there, but it's a beautiful city. They're at least there not lay it all over the streets anyway. That's right. They're not laying all over the streets and they take care of their people. And also you what, I'm counting the days on that of here. As a matter of fact, it's funny you mentioned Sweden because I had a story that I never got to last, I'll ever find it. But about how Sweden is like number one in terms of computer literacy around the world, you asked this look to number three behind Sweden and Denmark. It is. It's number one in a lot of technological related fields. And not only that, but it's just their standard of living is so high. I mean, I won't. My name Greg will put you on here for a minute. No, don't go running off now. I got to break. He always have a nice day. Sweetheart. Thanks. Don't go running off. He always does that. He comes in when he knows I'm in the middle of a segment here. He gives me a look. Look, how right in the face he's getting. I know your game. You've been playing this game forever for long before I came here. It's the old hidden run. Makes a little appearance. You know, I'm going to do the break even early now because we got that big baseball game. Coming up, it's the final score of 2017, by the way. We don't know the winner. Nice pitching, by the way. So let me ask you this. The billboard, I'm sure, and whatever, at a 441. What's the deal? What's the current status on our billboard? Still there. Would it be all the logos? Now is that he's holding up the piece side. I know it. That boy is holding up the piece side. He said, piece on me. You or something like that. OK. Carlos will. Well, that's great. We still got to build board up there. How do you like that, Donna, and Eddie, you silly old coupe man with a planned pants? In fact, the first game that Moe went over there to broadcast the dolphins. That was the first thing you said Eddie Jones. Take off those checkered pants. Yeah, that was the first thing you said to him. He's still wearing them. People are talking about you, Eddie. You're all fine. He lives in the same complex with the rumor. Same complex. They both have a $3.5 million house. And rumors still getting freemium. I bet you're Eddie Jones pays for his meals at the piece of lock. Not rumor. Anyway, that's it, Greg. See you. So in a billboard, it's still there as we find it grow a little pair. We're not going to be a coward. And Donna shall lay them by the way. The rumor on town is he's got a bigger pair than all of us put together. So when I'm here, that's just a rumor. Now Greg is not leaving. That's what he thinks. Nine minutes as a matter of fact, could be a range where it helps that one cart. Nine minutes after 11 at 5.60 QA hits that time of the year again. We got the basketball championships that I would have to send a couple of playoffs coming up. We got baseball man.

The ring rape is funny. A tower bitch on the radio who found a niche with no life as hosts. Chudding women,�� neck the sounds, and bad as frauds in sell you the time. The classification has been scuffer-faced. What's this no talent knows a better way? Still fading at the lift worth a doctor's youth. But she knows what is best for you. Dr. Nora of f***er. She does not rush up her phone. She's dispensing sound advice to morons' ways. The brains of mice. Hey, Dr. Nora by the way. How's your mother feeling today? Nora, I would strongly advise to put your tongue in my brown eye. Dr. Nora of f***er. Hey, Dr. Nora, you just discovered the smell of provolochis, and the smell of provolochis. No, 11.14 at 5.60. WQM, no, I'm not a Greg, but it's certainly been nice seeing it. Yes sir, absolutely. I'm going to start singing O'Candard to write here on a year. Don't do that, don't do that. We want to be real. Anyway, we got the billboard to steal up there. We took the balls off because you ended off in Zona Ebony balls. We got a little pair. We're playing large ball. Okay, how's that pull going by the way? Which of these describes you? Liberal? Ah, look at that. Greg came in here and now my mouse is all screwed up. Liberal against the war. 104 don't touch my mouse again, Greg. 140, liberals against the war. How many votes we got here, Carlos? 435, thank you. Independent against the war 94. Conservative in support of the war 69. Didn't make the number up. Independent in support of the war 42. I don't give you a Schmidt about any of it. 29, liberal in support of the war 21, liberal on the side of the 13. Conservative against the war 13. See I thought back in the beginning, the real Conservatives were all against this. Remember that? Yeah. Including Papukin and but independent on the side of 12 and conservative on the side of the two. So on the side, it's we got 27. Right knees down. Oh, did Eric ever facet me that thing? Yes, he did. He said, sorry. It took me a while to sort it. Well, don't do it again, Eric. And don't call Carlos. Okay, where I'm just kidding. Oh, here's Tom who says those who think the troops are coming back after a wreck. Better think again, not until the Bush administration gives control of the whole Middle East. I'm afraid you're right Tom. They got that plan, you know. First Iraq and in Syria and then Iran, although not necessarily in that order, but I think that's the order. And then who knows what's after that? Isn't that ironic though that the people that we should have been doing a lot Saudi Arabian Pakistan? Huh? The packies that I want to put the Taliban in the first place and they leader, Professor Moshar, a perfect Moshar. He's a military dictator who took over control of a government by a military coup. Kouku Koukou could chew. Anyway, here's how it came out. What are they banging again? Is that when he came in here to soften me up so I didn't complain that they're banging with a construction again down there? Is that what Greg was in here? To distract me from that? I may have an earplugged up a little bit but I'm not that deaf. They're banging on it. Oh, you know who that must be? Let us in! Let us in! That must be that crowd again. The right wingers. That must be the crowd from Fox. Let us in! No, you can't come in. We hear you knocking but you can't come in. You hear that? Yeah, it's a glorious crowd. Yeah, it's that same asshole. You remember those pictures from the election? Indeed. Let us in! Let us in! Boy, hang your camera would have been proud. Good, jolly Miss Molly. You understand? We just stop both of them stack up everyone. Not here. I know that you remember we had the big run on DuckTap and the Visc Queen? Right? Now we got a big run on hip boots. You can use your own imagination as to why. It's good to have hip boots to go step. Oh, god. Anyway, here's the who won that thing. Which of these is a phrase of a expressions bugs you the most? Weapons of match destruction, 121. Well, I've figured it's time to go. Yeah, weapons of a. Okay, that's a. Are you go girlfriend, her nine? That's because we can't stand Oprah. Oh, wow. A lot of those fat shut in women that George always talks about they love. Oprah. The rest of us can't stand that bitch. She has no talent. She makes me nauseous. I don't be grudge your heart, billions. Even the elf, she's lucky enough to make it more power to her. Just get out of our face, go away. 121 for weapons of match destruction, 109 for you, go girlfriend. 86 for WWE JD. What would Jesus do? What would Jesus do while all these bodies are being mangled and being decapitated, huh? That's a real good question. Or do you a hawks out there? What would Jesus Christ do? 21. Or I'm sorry. What are these other numbers on here? I've ever forgotten to don't ask. Don't ask. You know what I'm saying? 73. What's your take? 59. Don't even go there. 53. My bad. George says at all the time. I hate my bad. I like like little kids would say, oh my bad. I know. You know, 44. You know, I should have got a lot more votes than that. Well, what's wrong with you people? You say these things all the time, you know? My nigga, 43. Embedded 31. That was a small potato's after that. Small ball rolling head for it. That's because there's no Marlon fans. It's just a witch that's not playing small ball. There are playing. Here's a fact that says welcome to the Bizarre world. The most renowned rapper is white. The most famous golfer is black. And the reverberate commander and chief is a drag dodger. A wall from the National Guard. It says I don't want to play program director. Everybody possible to play the Civil Defense test for three hours instead of Mo and squeaky. You know, I think speaking of squeaky, but it's not the same squeaky that this guy is talking about. It's more like the other squeaky, you know? I know. I was thinking Wednesday that I knew to one hour. Mo bits, Mickey Mouse bits and what else? And I have one other category. I'll think of what it was. Huh? For the whole hour. And that was it. Very good. Excellent. Michael Jackson bits, Mo bits and Mickey Mouse bits. This Wednesday, no one will love that. I haven't played that in a long time. Is that in here? Probably not. Michael calls Tommy number 75. Yeah, it isn't there. I'm going to play that moment here. I love that. What about favorites? It is the one at the all time favorites. Even Greg was saying, when are you going to play that again? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. 5, 5, 6, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line. WQAM. Pretty good. I'm pretty good. I'm pretty quick. If I decoded that, I encrypted the comment. If I didn't have it in a little while ago, I think I'll be one of those people that you'll be a positive. That way, the minute. Encoded the camera was who Greg? No, do you have him with that? That's Carlos and that for George, right? Yeah. But you were saying that if you owe people an apology for the people who I guess went to know about 9 or 11 or a few days in. Oh, I apologize. Oh, you did a positive? No, no, I apologize right now. Oh, okay. I mean, I'm not saying that because you really have to. I just, I don't know if I can really convince myself. I would hate to be that cynical. I don't think I believe that. But it's starting to look really nasty, you know? Especially with all this peanut stuff and everything. It's starting to look really suspicious. Because if you remember, Dick Kany called Tom Dashall and said, don't investigate. Do you remember that? Yeah. And if you look at this, and then when they put Henry Kissinger in charge of the investigation, then you knew that the rare fox was guarding a old chicken coop. Look, why still an election to get in a power and then can't go along with the plans that you had all along? Yeah, that's true. Do something normal. Everybody would be like breaking into a bank and not stealing the money. Exactly. So how could they do what they do without the people behind them? How could they do what they do? You're right. So, well, I'm not one thing, one of the things. Yes, sir. I called Modest Morning about the... What did you call him? I could call him a lot of people. Okay, an old fossil? Yeah, he made a comment just morning about the golf thing and the... The gunsters? Yeah. And he said, well, what difference would it make if the women do get the gun there? And I called him, but I didn't get a chance to make the point because he hung up on me. Of course. I was going to make the point where what difference did I inject your Robinson making in the baseball world? And what difference did the... who was the... Lee Elder? Was neither first black guy there, isn't there? In the golf world? In Auguste, Lee Elder. Yeah. So, if they went to the lead, Lee Elder in, they had to put their tail between their legs to let Tiger Woods play out there. That shows you how embarrassing this whole thing is. But again, because it's women. And because it's a bunch of blue-dose guys on a sports talk station naturally, they're pandering to that mentality. Exactly. Okay, no. We're all going to chip in and buy them all at one of those beautiful, beautiful hoods. Huh? In fact, we're going to bring him to thevert right up to Bokka to his hood. He's not going to be able to wear it with a piece of the piece. Yeah, yeah. We will have a spot on the side. Like under the cutaway of things, so we can like fit through the side. Okay. Where the muskwack in Bokka's little head off the side of the hood. It can do the muskwack rambal right down the side of his head. 560, 0560, pound 560. We got the mallons and the braids come up at 1230. You know, some mentioned that a lot because I'm really excited about it. Because I forgot. Boy, I can't be getting to tell you what an orgasmic feeling that is when you come and you find out that you're getting out of here early. I mean, some people get pissed off and feel like we're cheating. Like I'm being lazy and I used to, too bad. Yeah, until you started doing this. Then you realize, oh, thank God. Thank you, old. Yeah, good. WQAM. Yes, sir. Okay. It was a bell shot. You green your phone, green your phone. After two minutes, the hangs up those fast busy. But they suck. They suck. The best investment I didn't make was ever renewed my season tickets for the fans the last two years. And I pointed out that every game this year. You sure had a lot of company. I'll tell you that. Unbelievable. And it could not kind of do anything. So why don't we just, I don't know, get some smart bombs. It over the, what is the own beast? Okay, great. 560, 0560, pound see that. He was doing so well until I got to that. You know, he dropped the big one right to him in the middle of it. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Which of these describes you? Liberals against the 446 independent against the 400. Conservatives against the war. We got 13 of those. That's 259 out of 462th. Conservatives of Puerto the war 71. Independent support of the war 47 as 118. And liberal support of the war 20 days 140. What do I say on the first number? 118, 246 and, uh, 2, uh, whatever it is. Don't win. It's going to change again in a second anyway. Look, this is, it's a convoluted thing. Okay, if I read the whole thing, we're not going to have anybody. Lose it's just too long. It's fine as a pool. It would be like if I, I think this weekend will do that ethnic pool that we do like once a year, you know, the breakdown in demographic pool. Right. Find out if we still have anybody listening, which I doubt. But, you know, but the, and so what will be the point of reading it, you know, I'm an 18 to 24 year old male. I can't get late. Well, I would be half our audience on this station. God. Clarence would have to vote on there. The beast. What? And I want to go to the upsh truck of at the beast. We saw the picture. She was, uh, for him. She was pretty nice. Yeah. For him. For him. My mother would be pretty attractive. 567. 560 pound, 560 on the end. And I'm going to say it again. This Friday on the beast in case you missed it lost two and a half more pounds came in here for his way and on Friday. 224 and a half. Still looks like a tub. And I'm going to lay the log down and no more diary and in the food, no more excuses either because the food that since I've been back for balance for life is outstanding. I had yesterday for my like, after the hockey game and quite frankly, almost lost my appetite. But I had a spinach few silly. With the spinach few silly, uh, Sicilian, which had like mushroom and I mushroom but had like, um, olives and capers and tomatoes and cheese that of course when you put it in the microwave the cheese melted all the way through it. It was to die for. Sounds great. And I got my rubin' rafts today, which I got more than one. But nevertheless, huh? I'm doing the old Rubin' Wrap Baby. Oh, oh! That's a Rubin' ask you to those who don't know who that is. Remember Rubin' a skew? You know he started looking pretty good. And Bobby Graham bought what a great governor he was compared to what we got now. Look what we got now. Papa, Janko, look what we got. We got the bush mice there. Everybody look good. It's everybody look. There's another bush. Seriously. Hey, look at him. Everywhere you look, there's another one. I'm getting kind of scary. I always told you guys watch out for the wicked bush. Wouldn't listen to me. 26 past 11 at 560 WQR. I told you your rackies look like I've heard that nasty bush. They're all very depth of the skin. There is a new D-contamina skin lotion though. Oh yeah. And you know what that new lotion does by when a new D-contamina? I can't find it. I can't believe it. I got the old thick finger now, which is really- Oh look at that! I can't do it, Carlos.

You know, we ought to do that again one of these days. And, you know, maybe tomorrow. Just a joke. It's just a joke. Anyway, National Public Radio reports that they found missiles with Seren and mustard gas. Didn't we have that on like an hour ago? Yeah. Yeah, well, that anyway, National Public Radio is saying it right now. The missiles with Seren and mustard gas already go to the use of? No. I guess it was too late. U.S. forces stormed through the bag, Dad. American tax and armoured vehicles, Robert and the bag, Dad. Today's storming Iraqi prison and Saddam Hussein's main presidential palace and destroying symbols of the Iraqi regime. Iraq offered little resistance, but later in Iraqi missile slamed into the tactical operations center for the U.S. Army second brigade of the Third Infantry Division, at least four people are including two soldiers and two more journalists were killed and 15 wounded in the strike army and the forces said, well, two more insifers dead in the separate fire fight east of Baghdad. Fighting also raids in southern Iraq where British forces increased their control over Bazaar as well as northern Iraq where coalition forces captured a key rage between Mosul and Kerkub. You did see by the way that for days that they had them, I mean, they got some of the electricity back on. No electricity in a city of five men in people, yep, and no water. But other than that and not only to mention that air that they were a given them all as men in the SEMA. Maybe they can sue somebody like Johnny Smith. Maybe John I would love to hear you back to you people know he won the lawsuit. How many times have the British said that they were in full of Bosra since they've gotten there? I think just over the weekend. But third man. Yeah. Here's the fact that says Bush has convinced that he is the Messiah. After he delivers the promised land, he figures he'll be at least get the title of profit, but the problem with his fax is they spelled profit with a pH. No, it's not the profit with a pH that they're all worried about. It's the profit with a PRO-FIT. FIT, which is what we're having as a fit. And I've spoken to many people in the building already. Many. But third man. Who saw those pictures of that family and Baghdad? And they don't quite get the idea that they're good friends. That this is their idea of liberation. They're scared, crapless. Did you notice the red cross at the hospitals are getting so baraged with wounded and dead? That they can't even keep track anymore and Baghdad? Yes. They can't even count a number anymore. They stop counting. It's up trying. Right. And of course, you know the response from these good right wingers, and these good goose stepers out there. That's just right wingers. Goose stepers. And all fairness to the right wingers. They got a lot of company. We got to get that before they get us. Brilliant. We're here to leverage you. But we're going to get you before you get us. Huh? What? Let's see. Here's a fact that says why couldn't Iran at that span? That's bad. But you do have a good point. I want to read it on here. Then I told Carlos, I agree with it. But it's just in very poor place. Then I'll put that in here. Hello. Then here's one that says, WWJD, what would George do? That's not bad. I like it. He wanted to start his own religion. I think when he comes back. Oh, George. We can maybe turn him on to that. And George thinks he's the Messiah. I mean, put me sure does. No, our George. Let's see. Mad dog Howard David and guilty already making excuses for the offense because of their schedule. Oh, man. Oh, making excuses in April because they got a schedule. You get your schedule based on where you finish. But they in December, we have to go over there. The NFL hates us. Oh, starting to sound like Wayne Gretzky. Out of whole world hates Canada. They want to lose the whole world. Wouldn't know where Canada was on a map if he gave him guy to him 15 donuts from Tim Hortens. And a hockey puck and a stone from the curling match. Ah, we sure miss our good friend, Sand Rush Merler, the Canadian Curler, Western Peace. You know, she died? No. No, yeah, like the year to ago. The great Canadian Curler, Sand Rush Merler. No, I remember the name. 10. Cancer. Western Peace. She died. Then it also says, your two new sports days in the beginning of West Palm Beach, goodbye morning show. Wow. Where is the crow? And he was gone. Thank you so much. Well, covered all the bases there, playing a little small ball. Then here's one. It's got a bunch of quotes from Hermon Geary. Well, we know that one. He said about how nobody wants to go to works of countries because people, he said, why would some poor slob on a farm on a risk is life in a war when the best you can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece. And whoever was the guy that was doing this interview, it says that the guy's name was Gilbert. Was interviewing Hermon Geary? Good match. It says there's one difference I've put it out. Lady Macres see the people of Sam C that matter through their elected representatives,and the US-owned congress can declare wars, and Geary says oh that's all well in good, but a Volksert Novois, the people can not always be bought, brought to the bidding of the leaders. That's easy. I'll have to know he was telling her being attacked and denounced the pacifist for lack of patriotism and exposing him to pública IRA to danger. It works in the same way in any country. He said, Hermon Geary, had he liked that? You understand? Stop both seems to havequelle in every way. The leak had to put it. He could't repeat it, I definitely not. We need more facts written here on them. I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you, but we need lots of, and you can bring that copy in here too. Don't give me that look like, you know, I'll take it right now. Whatever you've got, I'll take it. It's a very informal show. Just bring it on and give me some facts paper while you're at it. This is the same crappy already gave me. Isn't it? Oh, this is from Todd Drek. Facts paper. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. By the way, Greg was in here for a little while. He said, that's what he said. Chris, he always says that. One, he told noon at 5, 60, WQM. We got that big Marlins game coming up, baby, 12, 30, the pregame show. Speaking of the crow. I think the crow in the morning show would be a big improvement. How do you mention it, you know? 5, 6, 7. Oh, 8, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, I get a little chuckle out of that. I get more laughs out of just that little drop in there than I do out of that whole Mosho. Hell yeah, hold me. Yeah, call me homey, call me homeo. I mean. I got your crow by the time I hear homeboy. Oh, you'll have to play a bunch of crows stuff. I liked that. Yeah, for like, till the ball game is it kind of a warm up to the pregame show, the pre-pregame show, the four play show. How's that pull coming here, one, and oh, why did it just to many numbers? We don't have time. Twenty-till noon at 5, 60, see what a good mood I mean, who would George isn't here? Oh, I feel so much better. I mean, what? You could say, no, we just, we just, I don't know. He's, I'm not going to appreciate all the things he does. I can't think of any at the moment. But it's just that there's something about him. I'm, I'm trying to figure out in my mind what it is because he's such a hard ass, because he's got to the point where he's got a big ego now, a very thin skin, talks too much, interrupts me incessantly, and just, but other than that, plus, I mean, just cannot get laid to save his life. And it's just, every time he does the show, he takes over to hold God the empty thing to try to get himself laid, or at least just a sniff, you know. What do you really think? He's okay. 19 till known at 560, but he killed their few things worse than going off for refreshing swimming your beautiful pool in the yard, and then you'll look into pool and you realize it's a nightmare. It's stained. It's dirty. Maybe you've got a big crack in it and you're pooled too. Don't look at that mess anymore, just say no, Mo ugly pool and call our good friends at Atlantic Marseille.

You have to let those missiles drop. With a heavy artillery. We've got to shoot and never stop. We'll have to talk the big attack. Sheldon will the bag that fell.

I'm 46 and 560 WQM happy Monday too. Just put a big smile on your purse. A push? Cheryl Seals got a great calm. Somebody just thanks to me here. Look at that. Against the tide. Marching on Babylon. Bush's religious fanatics. I might have to just read this. You think I'll read a bedtime story? I just might do it. It's great. Then we'll put it on the website. Sometimes over the top. But actually she's like I said great. She is great. And I'll tell you who's not great. Greg Coates, you and any agree. At least you're consistent. You were more on and Harold. The Harold has got the worst crap. If I had a bird which I don't. Oh my God, by the way, put together real heavy package for our hot couple's contest. You got to put together? He's working on.

It's a taller and Greg Coates. You know, this is such a cock. You know, how much more paste that they supposed to be, Greg. And then he goes on to say it was fan appreciation. They meaning yesterday at the macaroon. Oops. I mean fan. Oh, an isolation. They said the sunrise I mean it was sold out. They said despite it being half filled. It was not half filled. I was there. The place was packed. Who those people who I have no idea. But they paid for the tickets. I mean, why do you have to lie? Why do you have to make stuff up, Greg? It's been a dismal year for the Panthers. They suck. Okay. The whole thing has got to hell in a hand basket. They've, uh, gutted the team. They have no veterans on her. Except a few stiffs. So are retiring now. Thank God. But that's it. But it was half empty. Wrong. Wrong. Greg. Greg Coates. Man at the mommy here. There's only one thing. You can say about him to be actually on it. To be honest with it. How did that come out in our pool? He's an asshole. That's right. Major, major oozing, piece of terror, Greg Coates. Anybody who was there with me yesterday, the place was packed. Jampag, that doesn't mean it was entertaining. And of course, once they'd fill it off, you fizzed go in and there, a lot of us flew out of there. Just flew out of that place like we're blown up. I got in Bezuka. Right. Like they were throwing like we'd find a cluster bomb like under the seat. Oops. Sorry. Time to leave. Anyway. But there's a lot of stuff coming down this fast machine. You must have brought me in a piece of coffee. The same piece of crap that Todd record and before here. Hey, Todd. Right. A real piece of coffee. Okay. Instead of going back to the old file and recycling the same turret over and over again. You idiot. Oh, yes. Got a couple of different numbers in there. I forgot. You. Oh. Go. When you see him in a hall step on him for me. Would you please? I'll take good aim. But just step on him. Todd. Dreck. Oh, shoes. I don't want to go to the table. But that's right.

Okay, because this is very important. Dull to him, come in here. He's probably to probably speak it in Spanish. Do you know how to say this? Okay. Yeah, yeah, right. K is exactly right. Just this one time, K. I'll let you ask me about my business. Well, let's play some godfather drops. here. Sheryl seal, where is this from? Which thing is this from? Oh, the news inside it. That's a good. You know, I don't know why more people don't read that website. Have you ever seen the polls they taken and got like 100 votes? Right. I don't get that either. It's a great website. But anyway, she says Bush's obsession with attacking Iraq has been attributed to oil to family vendetta due to his father's confrontation with Saddam and with O'Resella's terrorist fighting efforts. However, what really lies beneath this obsession is a religious delusion, one shared a last by many of his government appointees including John Ashcroft, they devout Pentecostal. Bush, like Ashcroft, believes in his in fact trying to ensure that the world is in the end times, called for by the biblical book of Revelation, at least is interpreted by the Doom Sayers, who are generally barely functional, clinically classical paranoid schizophrenia, parabits and being a prime example. Early Graham Bush is much-touled in mentor believes Armageddon is at hand and is helped to fuel Bush's Messianic complexes they bless it later of the righteous in the end times. You can see that Messianic complex so clearly in Bush is often an appropriately wrapped risk expression and grandiose body language. In this fantasy scenario, following a mighty battle in the region, the faithful of Pinported is Iraq, about 144,000 good Christians will be sucked up in heaven while the rest are left to fry in a horrific conflagration. The support Bush you shown is real isn't because of his pro-duos sentiments, it's because the end times prescription calls for Jews to be in complete control of all of his real at the time of the big event. But according to the Fanatics nasty little scenario, the joke will be on the Jews will be left to burn with everybody else, aside from a few last-minute converts to Christianity. Sharon playing a painfully aware of Bush's obsession is taking full advantage of it, he just asked when he's expected to be granted up to $10 billion more to help secure Israel and by warplanes to help secure Babylon. In the Fanatics scenario, Iraq plays a special central role as Babylon embodying the false religion and the empire of the anti-Christ in the end times. Here is a blurb for a book plugged by the Bible prophecy in the Raptor report to two Babylon's authored by the late Reverend Alexander Hishlop. An excellent source of information regarding the beliefs and rituals of the ancient Babylonian cult that will dominate the empire of the anti-Christ just as it dominated the major world empire in the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church, by the way, is targeted for the wrath and vilification of the righteous raptor as to condemn it as a false religion. I doubt if it's any coincidence that since Bush has been in the office, the media has aggressively and relentlessly gone after the Catholic Church, finding the pedophile priest originally will modern witch hunt, not enough. While failing to investigate or expose similar allegations, chronically being made by members of other denominations for such abuse may be just as rampant or even worse. Bush's mentor Billy Graham, as he grew an international fame, became very adept at appearing far more non-finaticly than he truly is in order to draw bigger audience in a bigger bank account. Yet, Graham attended Bob Jones University and for some time is on record making anti-Semitic comments in phone conversations with Richard Nixon, and in 1948 declared the three gravest menaces faced by Orthodox Christianity are communism, Roman Catholicism, and Mohammedanism. In reality, Graham is still very much of a fanatic promoting the end-time zealously, here's a quote from his website. The Bible plainly forecast the coming of yet another great war. It'll be a war to eclipse anything the world has ever seen. It will embrace most of the nations of the world, and its focal point will be the Middle East. Where the armies of the world will someday deploy themselves, set a regular amount, make it make it a mega-low, whatever the hell I did. The great war has been called the Battle of Armageddon, in the midst of this tear, see if George was here, he'd know. Miquito. That's not a good example. It's not espionial. In the midst of this terrifying war that could destroy civilization in the Lord Jesus Christ, I'm sorry, I wasn't ready for that, like I said. In the middle of this, the Lord, come on, my Lord, I don't have all day here, the Lord. Jesus Christ. Low return to his earth in glory and power to the generations of the world and self as homerlogists kingdom. The script you described is this great battle in the 16 chapter of the book of Revelation. The 16-joo will probe his vile upon the great Ufraities. Squirtch Court. Sounds vile to me. We're told that the waters of the Ufraities are will be dried up, that the way of the kings in the East might be prepared. The dry riverbed will permit unenhended passage of the Great Armageddon East to the scene of the battle. Unclean spirits, demons, will go out into the world to the kings of the earth to gather them into the battle of that great day battle mighty. Oh. This passage is terrifying because if you use this scenario as Vush's real context for the rack war it fits so well. It explains that total refusal to listen to any sort of reason to the please of traditional ally to the protest of millions, who cares if millions protest if you're fighting evil to whiz led by the anti-Christ in the end times in or anyway. Billy Graham has been described by followers and possibly by himself as the second coming of John the Baptist. If so, then Vush got help us all, is being seen by fanatics as the second coming of Christ, who is now in the process of setting up his own glorious kingdom. Jesus Christ, that I've version of water from the Ufraities, a river that runs across southern Iraq, seems to play a big role in this prophecy. Don't be surprised if hear the Pentagon issuing a demand that I've heard or pump water out of the Ufraities, if this happens it will certainly be an ominous signal the loony's are advancing their cause. It's not stretching too far to wonder if a good part of the reason Vush allowed embedded reporters in Iraq was because he wanted the glory he assumed was imminent to be witnessed and recorded his triumphal entry into Babylon. Hillary should be recalled, always had the press on hand, record his triumphal entries in the France poll, etc. It's telling that Vush has granted some of the coveted and veterinary reporters spots to ultra-right wing Christian outfits, including Pat Robertson's Christian broadcasting network. Robertson is one of the most delusional rapturous to round. I'm sure he wanted to make CBN was in on the glorious unfolding of biblical prophecy, because the mainstream media are unquestionably supporting Vush, they're released by default supporting his insane fundamentalist motivations. Check out this religious fanatic site. You'll see that they proudly list their selected network information, CNN, FoxNMS and B.C. You'll also notice to the right of the page, Iraq and biblical prophecy as an omg in the rapture is the subject of the popular, funny literature. What is the website? Is it the CBN website probably? Oh, could be. It seems totally unreal that our nation and the rest of the world are being dragged through here and hopefully back again by a band of religious fanatics who have insisted through sheer force and relentless intimidation that the world stage be yielded to them so they can play out their fantasies in everybody else's expense. In any case, as the Iraqi conflict unfolds, we non-illusional folks see thousands of young tired, scared, and hungry soldiers struggling through the desert. Vush in his band of fanatics mean, while he gods end times army marching to glory, past the ruins of Babylon. You know what I can say to that? Oh, that's all I can say. Scary, scary. I prefer to think that maybe she's just wrong and maybe it's really more about money. I hope that. Yeah. These are also. That's right. Let's hope that all that stuff about money and about big business and their revenue hands together with Glee and Halle Burton and all that other stuff. Let's hope that that's true. Because it sure beats the alternative. Four minutes till noon at 5.60, Jesus Christ, I'm in your Q.I.N. They're Steve Goldstein, but you can call me, Gelsie. Whenever I'm in town, I listen to, wait a minute, I am in town. It's the 12th of one hour. That. We'll come back to the superfluous tunneling with some of the Mohauna David at home. We got the three quarters on power rotation for you, Perusil. Hey, Moha! What? The speed and I'm feet about hokey. We got special tests today. No one's allowed in here, but they bring food for their king. Good, good, good. To lay, sack already fucked them. Oh, I am. Who the hell are these Moza Moos? That's the written sun. You know, strike home with us today. Go, tell me. I never heard of you, but... Well, I wonder why. Well, what do you do? You got an act? Yeah. Exactly. Like what? We spend the wheel. Wherever the wheel stops, we grab me off of it. We slam it and you name it. What's funny about that? Well, you got a point there. What can you just ask me a question? You ready to put your head into toilet bowl? Yeah. You do that funny, huh? Well, I got news for you, Paul. You folks think of the precipice and getting fired at it right now. Get out of my place of business. No. I don't write something. I give you one more chance to show me what you got. I hope this isn't really funny because I got a really full bladder. All right. These were things that probably adults would know. They're like old sayings that I want you to fill in the blank. You know how to do that? Yeah. Here we go. The bigger they are, the harder they get to do. Yeah. What are you doing? Please. Did I get payments clearance to give you payments to laugh? How dare you laugh at the ride, all right? I don't even care anymore. Hey, don't be whole my green pig. Okay. What are you looking at? Freckle face, Sammy. And you guys got a condo. That's condo, mo. What up? Yeah, I do. I mean, I don't such does. Fine. And I might as well one is I didn't push today. Okay. I'm just a spinnier meat reconcile. A spinnier meat, ricken, let's do it. Oh. Oh. Oh, gana. Oh, what's the matter? I was shooting first. Oh, see, I told you it's not my day. Oh, so embarrassed. There's no way I can do it. I'm just a little bit too hungry. What a funny okay. It's not right in Belarus. Okay. Oh, clean up. Come on to a five, 60, WCM boy. We got a sure half hour here, a better rush. And I lost it this man when I was being asked to say about Jesus. So what you got? Yeah, holy crap. I think the antichrist must be around somewhere. In fact, I think it was in her little while ago. That's a power of Christ who tells you the power of Christ who tells you. I know we got to have that this. You know, if I can't find that, we can't continue with the show. Do you believe that? Yeah, because it's used anyway. Let's go. Oh, seriously, that's one of the early on. I was going to even use that today. It's just disappeared. It vanished in the middle of the near, Bokobrine. Sure. It's not the player, right? It's in the player. Wait, but it's in the player, but it's not on any number. You see what I'm saying? Oh, so you're right. Uh-oh. Well, let's see if it's going to work. Maybe we have another function of the junction. Male function. Let's see if it plays. I am proud, Yelianna. Russian laden. And I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels. And listening to the near. Okay. I'm going to use the hour. Check out. All right. There you go. Tony was in the player. I know if we're looking there in a million years. Because it just had the two dots here like the thing was empty, you know? That's why when you're looking for something, it's looking at least likely placed. Maybe in somebody's vacuum. Which in these describes you, we asked on thearages.com. Look at that number. 5, 5, 5, oh, oh. You see this is tied together? That's a horror. I'm trying to kill the track. I bet you're another half-hour. If that first number is 6, we're in deep crap. Good thing to Marlingeems on. Liberal against the war 173. Independent against the war 13. Oh, sorry. Conservative in support of the war 79. Independent support of the war 58. Are you writing these down? Take on. Well, do it. You're an idiot. 17414 is 288. In support. Independent support of the war not on the see. I can't do it against. So. 305 out of 557 against the war. Got it? In support 79. Conservatives. 58 the independence. That's 137. And Liberal's 32. 169, right? See, there it is again. You're making that up? No, I'm not. So 305 to 169. Undersided. 20 independence. 17 liberals and two conservatives. So that's like 39. And then we got a bunch of 43 people don't give a shmit about any of it. They don't care about politics about the war. They just want to live their lives. They want to go out and get laid. That's what they want. They want some good weed. Go out and get laid. That's it. That's what muffs said. Now, what did I just do with that other very important story? The one in Hawaii never got to, all over it's from Friday, but we never talking about it on the year. This is a great story. Speaking of religious nuts. Army Chaplain offers baptism and bats, whether you want one or not. Can't push master Iraq. This was in the Harold. In this dry desert world near in the Jamf or Army of E.Core combat support systems, sprawls across miles of Scabber's dust. Oh, don't you like that phrase? Scabber's dust. There's an oasis of sorts, a 500 gallon pool of pristine cool water. It belongs to Army Chaplain, Josh Iyano of Houston, who sees the water shortage, which has kept thousands of filthy soldiers from bathing for weeks as an opportunity. It's simple. They want water. I have it as long as they'd read it. It baptize, he said. And agree they do. Every day soldiers take the plunge for the Lord and come up clean for the first time in weeks. They do appear physically and spiritually cleansed. Iyano said. So in other words, every time they want to take a bath, every 10 of them want to clean up a little bit. They got to go in there and do a thing for... Jesus Christ. First though, the soldiers have to go to one of Iyano's hour and a half sermons in his dirt floor tent. Then the bat is in takes an hour and a quarter from the Bible. Ah! Regardless of their motos Iyano said, I get the chance to take them closer to the Lord. Jesus Christ. A blue eye 32 year old in the abundance of energy. Yannagos that every day to draw up grimy soldiers for his pool. Who needs a bath that bad? Well, maybe he wants to give them a bath. Real bad. It's the Army Chaplain, you know. He talks to truck drivers. Ah! Tank drivers. Computer specialists. Anyone and everyone. He goes out to the combat zone of the fighting soldiers. And the combat support soldiers who keep them in supplies. You have to be aggressive to help people find themselves in God. He says Jesus Christ. He calls himself a southern Baptist evangelist and justifies the war in killing with a verse from the gospel of Matthew, which he often recites. Give unto the Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's. This means we are called upon by our government to fight and that is giving unto Caesar as the Bible tells us. What? You followed that? No. That verse meant taxes, but... Now, are you interfering again? Sorry. Earlier this week, Word went out to the portable showers. The portable showers might be installed here soon, but Yana was undawnded. There is no fruit out here, and I have a stash of raisins, use boxes, and fruit rolls to pull out. He said, so when and that he's going to pull out his fruit and tempt him, he's got Word of Bible. Yeah, that's right. If the water don't do it, then the fruit will. How about you? There's a little bit of fruit out there, and then as it catch my drift. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Marlins in the Braves, 1230 pre-game. And we're pretty pumped up and fired up about that. How about you QAM? I don't know. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. How about you QAM? I see that was one of those things. So that's the end of our calls on screenless here. You'll want to know why because all morning long, I've been bitching about that. Dan Braves in Marlin game, I haven't prone to it. We're doing screenless. There's not a single call on the board on screenless. That's impossible. After all this heavy duty crap, see they just race away. They don't want to be, you know, it's like SARS. They want to cleanse themselves talking about taking a bat. They want to like scrub with soap and out of the, so they get away from that Marlin baseball game, especially that Dave N. Boring. Oh, he is so unbelievable. You know where he ought to go up and away with the fifth dimension, or maybe into the fifth dimension, he's terming. WQAM? Hi, yes, this is a show. Yes, man. Hi, yeah. I wanted to ask that from the added to the poll today. Okay. Go ahead. That people who are against the war, but in support of our troops. Well, that's everybody. Everybody's against it. We're also part of the troops. That's a couple of seconds. No, no, it is. I don't know why you're laughing. Everybody supports the troops, whether you're for the war against our whole. Well, I hope so too, but I don't know. We have to have people sign up on the, on the cheese, especially people who are in the war, they really need to be against the war, but for the troops, there is a difference. I think you would be saying, you didn't know you didn't express it, where at the first time for the troops, but against the war. Okay, well, that's a good one. Exactly. Okay, thanks. Okay, do we need to put that on there? No. No, because I think it's redundant. I do understand what you say. We don't need to put that on there. There'll be a lot of work for Eric. And Eric is against a lot of work. No, no, no, don't do it, Eric. And just a joke, don't get up tighter. Oh, my God, he almost took the neck, I didn't chicken burrito. From the director of Girls Gone Wild. She is the wild wild action. It's Amish gone wild. Joshua, you may observe my ankles. Oh, you are crazy, girl. Under my dress, I am very lazy, Hosing. Up you gone wild? Well, wild, I tell you, you're wild. Amish gone wild. Check out my rap. You have a beautiful rock. May I touch it? Have you ever seen a nicest scene? A nicest spy shot? I think I close gun wild over here. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Well, 14th. Good. Thank you, Laura, that I, uh, caught a look in the machine to find that disc. No, it doesn't matter. You know, it's when you like, uh, a CD like that. You know that it's around somewhere. And you say they couldn't disappear the dog to need it. And you know what depends length, then you can't find it. Arms like, sorry. It says what publication was the article by Bill Orrriley published. And I think many say it was in a Harold on Saturday. But I think if we go to the Fox website, do so very carefully, by the way. Uh, and the Bill Orrriley thing on a Fox website, he's got all of his recent columns. PS, I wish you to move the account down to your retire from your website. No. It is so depressing. I thought it was kind of uplifting. Well, it's depressing. That's so long. Please don't ever retire. And the city needs you. Thanks again for a great show. I helped anyone from the public with the truth. Please don't ever retire as well. Linda, I hate to break the news here. I think this is it today. Carlos is going to be doing a show tomorrow with Miguel. And that's fun, you will. Why you know, see ethnic wave of the future? And so for an old speaking race, speaking of punny, I'm speaking of punny. WQAM. Yes sir. I'm trying to reach the new Roger. You're speaking to him sir. Let me say it again. Don't wait for the later catch. We'll be here the next circle. Okay. Go on Neil. Yes sir. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? Good. Thank you. I wanted to call in defense of the military. Oh, no, a splurge would never be there. Good information from. Well, it's not them sir. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. In defense of because. You can't say because of one. He's hiding those people in those houses. There's a reason why they have to go in there like that. And I looked at that and I thought, yeah, yeah, it was sad because. Sir, do you think, wait, wait. What do you think that once those people came outside, there was necessary, the, the, the wife and the little children that was necessary for them to sit there on a ground where their hands behind her back, aiming their rifles if them over the people trembling like they were about to lose their lives, which I'm sure they believe they did or thought. What does that, is that? That's the way they run this, this war and date of the day. Who's the, who's the, sir, there are five million people in Baghdad. Are we going to go house to house and terrorize every family? Is that the idea? Maybe that's maybe that's the only way we can go. Well, you know, something that's one more reason we should have been there in the first place, OK. There's a great reason why we should have been there in the first place. Wars of liberation now and not supposed to be wars of terrorism. I thought we were supposed to be against terrorism. I'm sorry. Unless we're the ones that are doing it. Unless we're doing the terrorizing, which was at that shock and all was supposed to be all about in the first place. We're going to terrorize them. And of course, you can't, you can't do it surgically. You can't just terrorize the military and like all the population, all the poor slippers of it, or whatever, just want to live their lives and be left alone. And they're like, hey, this is great. You know, they're more of that way. How would you like to be one of those five million people living in Baghdad with the light school out intermittently with all the, with the mung in the air that's just got to be unbelievable. More splurses over Baghdad, by the way, right now as we speak. So we are looking either at the special Republican guards inside the Fennel and inside the city, because the standard Republican guards are outside in the suburbs. Well, the real Republican guard, please stand up if you can. How'd you like to be one of those people with the endless bombing night after night after night after night? We keep reading in history books about the poor people in England, who had us survive the relentless bombing by the Nazis night after night after night. And those were our allies. The good guys weren't doing the bombing in those days. They supposed to be good guys. The non-evil doers. Anyway, Mark Faxes and says, I heard your apology while I didn't make a full apology. I said, I'm thinking about a Mark about that nine-level thing. He says, personally, I consider it unlikely, although not impossible, that the Bush administration participated in perpetrating nine-level, although certainly as president for the West government considering such tactics in the past, and of course he goes on about the odi odi odi odi operation northwards, I saw that. However, I think it's quite possible the Bush administration even more so is really intelligence knew something big was coming, and were content to have it happen to advance agenda as both foreign and domestic that would have been impossible without such a provocation. And then it goes about on about Roosevelt and Pearl Harbor, which is about everybody knows that. Okay, Mark. Well, I'm still evaluating. Okay. I hope I'm wrong. I don't want to be that cynical. I hope I'm wrong on both counts. But it's sure there are so many things going on, especially the fact that for a year and a half now, despite the fact that we're being having the crap scared out of us with orange lords and Michelin, there's nothing has happened. Nothing. There hasn't been one teeny tiny active terrorism since 9-11 in this country. There hasn't been a suicide bombing. There hasn't been anything. We got Cuban people coming up hijack and planes in both cities. Of course, that's old stuff. That's because we've got that whole-man security pump. Right. But there hasn't been one single active terrorism in the last year and a half. No matter how much. Oh, I guess who I saw in PBS yesterday with the McLuckland, eh, with John McLaughlin. Father McLaughlin, sorry. Tommy Thompson, the old cheesehead. Yeah. He was talking about SARS and about this and about that. And he won't run for Senate and Wisconsin. And the McLuckland was egging him out about. He's got a knockout for a spine goal. And I don't think so. I don't forget he drank water out of a creek. He was an author as he got. Yeah, when he goes on and says, don't get too worried about SARS right away. I crawl into the bed. Whatever, Tommy Thompson says, jump. I'd delay that one real fast. I'd flopped on on, crawling the bed. What an idiot. How tell you boy, this guy's sure surrounded him with a bunch of people like give me tremendous confidence. Tommy Thompson, Tom Ridge, got the personality of a dead man. Even my little dog's got more personality. He's been dead for a couple of months. Tom Ridge, the sea inspiration or what? And then he's making jokes about the duct tape and the visc Queen. After everybody like laughed him off the goddamn stage. Making jokes about it. Wow, keep saving for next time. Save it for next time. God, Almighty, these are the people who are leading us. These are our leaders. And you wonder why we got how many percent on here? 7.7% don't give a Schmidt about any of this. Who can blame him? Maybe they're the smart ones. They're just out there having a good time like the yellow. They're just out there trying to get laid two, three times an hour. The reen says how about three and he said, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Who-who. Wow. You said it'll be a cold, cold day in hell when that happens. It's to be like a goddamn ice storm at the Arctic Circle when that happens. 21 past no but she hates mo. 21 past no but a QMR. We're working on that thing and we're getting that thing going.

Coming up tonight, on Inside the Behind the True Hulleywood Celebrity Music Biography Profile Story, we take a good hard, stiff look into startup. He poured his heart out in song, telling a woman that he didn't miss her, even though he really did. Unfortunately, the woman just didn't get it. He was John Waiter. I'm innocent you're right. Looking back, I guess I should have just told her the truth, but I'm a songwriter, damn it. I had drawn to irony. John Wake was trying to make a statement by telling his then wife that he wasn't missing her. Hoping she would pick up on the ironic subtext. Sorry, but I'm a face-value kind of girl. John Wake's long-lost love. Judy Zero irony. What was a supposed to think? I told him to go f***ing self. How could she miss it? It was so damned obvious. I ain't missing you. Said you been gone. Oh, wait. It's right there. It's really saying I miss you by saying that I don't miss you. I mean, you get it wrong? Yes, yes, Mr. Wake. I get it. Hold still now. It's time for your shot. It's poetry. I was just approaching my true feelings. I guess I can't deny all of those feelings. Yes, as I see, this will make it all better, Mr. Wake. John Wake lives a quiet life in a private facility. The location of which we are not at liberty to divulge. However, we can say that. When in London, make sure to visit lovely Trafalgar Square. Ah, oh, yes, that's nice. I feel better now. Can I go back to the bright blue room now? John Wake. He ain't doing bad at all. Get it? That means he really is doing bad. It's a big, gross shopping with like a show business tonight. Uninside the behind. 26 past noon, Marlins and any of Raves come up only momentarily. Supreme Court upholds law ban in cross-burning. A divided Supreme Court upheld a state ban on cross-burning and really Monday that the history of racial intimidation tends to symbol outweighs the free-speed protection of Ku Klux-Lansman or others. A burning crosses an instrument of terror and government should have the power to stamp out or punish its use just as Sandrad don't call me Carol O'Connor Road. How do you like that? Yes, she ain't no Carol O'Connor, I guarantee that. That bitch. Okay, here's the fact that says now that it appears imminent the USA's conquest of Iraq will soon be completed. I have an idea for a poll on keeping with a true American out of an oral spirit to bring Iraq's populace into the 21st century. Let's decide what American franchise or business should be the first established in our Iraq. McDonald's, Burger King, Cleveland Clinic. Oh my god. Neil Rogers show. The more Howard David did show. Treasure Island. And the list goes on. I do you like that. Well. Yo J. Oh, we got the ball game. Everybody tunes in. They don't go right in a way because they know this UB Hillon is coming up at the end of the year. So, for the second way is to send that great Marlins and Braids game. Baby Finals score. Marlins 172. Graves, Auburn, 69. So you did it again. Thank you. I'm a fan of you and his money. I'm a big big star. I'm a big star. We have this little lady. Yo, yo, yo, yo. This is good to come. Right. The link. Yes. So, forget. Hank from Shula's right after Marlins baseball. And you got to her cool in hotline in Tula's at seven. Well, Lando Alzighiri, the big. Oh. At Tula's at ten. Eddie K. from G.A. Who had a sterling show from Gulfstream. I'm a pride. But that was entertaining. And then now it's your mark overnight. You be Ellen. You be Ellen. You be Ellen. You be. You be. You want one ticket. You be. You be. You. One rose seed. Lead for your name. We're the end. But that's by feet. Game's about the start. You can't stop one. Two for feet. And you find a way.
