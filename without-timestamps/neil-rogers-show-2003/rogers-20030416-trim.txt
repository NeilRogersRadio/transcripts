But this was a good friend, so we said he's gonna go over his body and throw some of them in his hand, and Carlos is neck and the heel at the big toe hand again. He's gonna heel it like he did that horse last night, and also the other kid with a broken neck. That was pretty nice, since I could try to kill him with a pickup truck. That was pretty damn Christian of one, that mighty white. That really was. That wasn't, that was okay last night. That was alright. That wasn't great. I'm really quite a lexluther in that problem, and I'm really tired of his crap. He's just really old and stared, you know? Go see Chuck Alphay or he lexl, we're guy with all your money. Yesterday's pool, Lloyd Price was on there by the way, hit the brick the news to you. It says, from who's this from Rick? Rick, happy pace of past under he said. Happy underpass. That's where Carlos lives. Happy past under. Why do we call it past over and not past under? Because, well, the angel that passed over. Are you starting with ever, like, just crack it up and crap is the operative word. He says, Lloyd Price, he had seven votes. He was on air, but parents, frog man, Henry was not. And he mentioned him. Parents, frog man, Henry was pretty interesting. And got some of that stuff over there. I don't want you to find it though. I'd like to continue with that. We could take about a month and do that, you know? I'm really surprised we didn't have a lot more good choices, huh? It would they weren't expecting it. As a matter of fact, they also probably aren't expecting this. During the long pit, I just played there since it is a Jewa day. Friday will be a Catholic day, good Friday. The other Christians don't celebrate good Friday, right? Yeah, but it's not like a big to do. They do. They just observe it's not Friday was happening like that. It is. They just don't think of that. I sure wouldn't want to do this per priest victim to two dices. I better do it before Friday. So better do it now. Because we don't want to get Dennis all been on the shape. When he's eaten his wafer, so whatever he's going to be doing, and that tuna fish and macaroni casserole, I do like macaroni and cheese. You know, that sounds really good. Tuna and macaroni and cheese. You're does. Done it? Mm-hmm. I don't know why. I can't eat that. The macaroni and cheese, not on my weight loss program. Per priest victim to sue dices for a bit. 34 man sued Long Island Catholic dices from more than a billion dollars, saying church leaders did little or nothing to stop priest, who sexually abused them as children. I'll be damned. Our childhood was stolen, said Brian Dion, 51 of claims he was molested from 1959 to 1962, and King's Park Long Island. He and other plaintiffs say the dices of Rockville Center, not only failed to prevent the priest from attacking other kids after being warned about their behavior, called doubt, and had lawyer representing 23 men and one of two such suits filed yesterday, and I saw county Supreme Court. They sued the dices for a billion dollars. We're here because the church put the sexually predatory priest to have other children. Another plaintiff, John Salveson 47 said he wrote, then Bishop John McGan in 1980, to say that the Reverend Robert Hunaky had molested him as a boy, asking that Hunaky be removed from service in the priest's appears. Be told of his conduct. Instead of doing these things, Salveson told reporters as his daughter looked on. Bishop began in the dices, move father Hunaky from parish to parish from school to school for perid nine years. Doesn't it sound familiar? Yeah. Sounds just like all the other things that they did all of these things. WQA and Passover line, hello. Yes, good morning, Neil. Please start to you. And back to you. Did you see that little sick bit about Michael Morris, speaking at the University of Texas yesterday? No, I did not, but amazingly, your psychic powers guess what I have in my hand, stupid white man. I have the Michael Moore book in my hand. We have a graph of it and a graph of things too. But yes, real quick, he talked at the University of Texas yesterday. And he said, it's not about the weapons of mass destruction. It's about the weapons of mass destruction. I'm still a little bit correction. And to you, sir, how does Ethan say, when you forgot one good group yesterday? King Crimson was great. And the real mob hour. And the keep going. That's a good one, Neil. See, they're on a roll. It's mixing match, my eyeballs, Maria Moldar, and midnight at the oasis. Remember that? Yep. Well, I'm pretty sharp today. You know what I think is what I banked my head a couple of times out here. We had a little phone problem. We couldn't get the phone thing or working here this morning. Starting at about, how many minutes passed seven? About thirty minutes. And that went on for a lot more than that. Went on for over an hour. And you know, you guys, I'm not going to get sucked into that again. I'm never going to let you in the engineers. K, it must be on your end. You know, Carlos, isn't it must be Carlos is going to Great job on our website. Here we are. He really is. All right. It's in between your ears. That's where the lose court is. I defend him. But since he ripped me all last week. No, but it's true. I mean, I don't want to go into it. What's the point? Are we hashing the obvious? It's always on your end. I've been doing shows here. What is this now? Yeah. Are you an in-sum? Yeah. It was March last year. So it's like 13 months that I've been doing a shows here in Toronto on and off. And except for one time after it was a lightning strike here, that we set the thing and look, Christie sneaked into the place. And I had to reset the tell us other than that. And the problem is always on that end. Yep. It's not like magic. Like some kind of a creature is moving towards the right. Yeah. It's like magic. It's like, tap a thin care putting another spell on things. Oh, and how about that? Boots Charlie on passions. I've got to know get too much butcher nettike. I mean, you're missing out. You really are. Yeah. What are these days? I'll be the one. You're missing out if it's only Sheridan. Okay. I don't care what anybody says. She is one of the most gorgeous women on a face of the earth. She's got a great body and unbelievable face. Beautiful head of hair and great head. I mean, of hair. She's something. But you obviously don't care. So I think that what some of the people have said about you. Probably they got a poem starting to think. Anyway, there's a chapter in there, which I promised I would read to be fair, right? Right. Democrats, DOA. I'm not going to read the whole chapter. I'm not going to do it right this second amendment. I will in the Michael Moore book. Stupid white man. Remember when I read all the stuff about the ripped off election and about all of the George W. Yeah. Well, I'm going to do this also because he's right. And that's the reason we're in a pickle at Wren is because then a credit party is DOA. They're absent. They're a wall. They're useless. They're important men. Very sad. One party country. And speaking of weapons advanced destruction. One of the bedtime stories today talks about so many of our friends. So many countries we call our friends have advanced destruction. US allies also have weapons advanced destruction. For example, it goes on about Israel and Egypt, Pakistan, India, Taiwan, on and on. It goes this is from Ananova, North Indian publication. Maybe we'll get to it. Maybe won't. You might want to prove it on our website along with other great bedtime stories. Since Carlos is doing a fabulous job on our website. And then of course there's always Eric. Oh, we can put the pull up that Eric. And he already did. Look at that. Great minds work alike. We've done this before, but of course it keeps changing. We want to keep our thumb on a pulse of the nation like the polls they keep taking. The most dangerous person in the world today is George W. Bush, Ariel Sharon, Sodom, if alive Hussein, Osama, if alive bin Laden, Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney, if alive, Richard Pearl, Donald Rumsfeld, Mohour David or Kim Jong-Eel.

So this is Randy West. If you can't tell the difference between me and Ron Jeremy, you should try girls. You know him as the staple of MSMBC News. And now the long-awaited CD is here. The Ramsay sings their favorite beach boy hits. Well we are not ragging, but we killed our daughter and had enough money to write the authorities with plenty left over it. We should decide to keep here again. No, no, to show we don't know who cracked us going in. And our rule. I shall go back. You know friends, won't expedite. You wish faster? My be choice. Yes, it's the Ramsay's singing their favorite beach boy hits. Now available from filthy pleasure records. And I should like to point out that George Osteys people in apology because the globe this week the tabloid de Globes says innocent, Judge Clares John and Pansy Ramsey and the death of John the day. Oh right. You all in apology. No. Here's a passage to remember Poko and Elton Bishop. Yes, we do. Go back to yesterday's poll. We'll continue taking suggestions on that for next four or five months. Innocent is what the big headline says here. Pansy Ramsay sobbed with relief after federal judge Julie Carns. Clear to her of any involved by the way. He still can't tell if the body was a butcher name. Lacy and the fetus. What's her name? Piers and I know what her name is. I'm just the check and see her paying attention. Okay. They don't know what it is. Pansy Ramsay sobbed at a clear of any involvement in the murder of her daughter John Bene. I'm innocent and finally everybody knows that she guessed. We still all believe it by the way, Pansy. No. In a momentous decision for the Ramsay's and millions of people worldwide who were gripped by the case. Judge Carns reported the weight of the evidence is more consistent with the theory that an intruder murdered John Bene that is with a theory that Mrs. Ramsay did so. If social eyepatchy whispered, dear God, I never doubted you when she was told with a decision it's victory last she said. Oh God. But it's been a long hard road and when I see John Bene I'll tell her all about this day when she sees John Bene in that wonderful place up above. Or down below. As Globes exclusive photo showed the joint really well. Let's hear the crux of it. Okay. In a devastating blow to the case that police built against the man's judge Carns ruled and land as U.S. has to record that the evidence some of it never made public before. Crite out intruder. They've never, never, never, never, never, never in the second floor guest bedroom. Close by John Bene's own room. A rope was discovered in a brown paper sack that needed along to the ranzies. Got it? Got it. How do they know if the rope or the brown paper sack belong to the ranzies? Right. When Cranstein investigators vacuumed John Bene's bed they found small pieces of brown sack material. Other pieces were later found. In the body bag used to take care of the morgue the judge clearly believes that an intruder came in a equipped with sack and rope. It indicates that there was a plan to abduct a little girl. Fires consistent with the court and the Garrett used to strongly were found in John Bene's bed. The judge thought this was important because defining the fibers the beds of just the Cran began there, which tends to damage a long standing belief that Patsy hit John Bene in a rage in the bathroom and then stayed there. Everything the cover up was an accident. At least seven windows and one door in the ranzies home were found open in the morning jamberies body was discovered. Police test showed an intruder could end the basement through one of the windows. Leaves and white starry foam debris pulled in the window. Window whale were scattered on the floor below suggesting somebody actually got an in through there. How is it that all these years later? There's suddenly finding these things. I don't know. The basement lights were found out when the house was for a search for a missing jamberies at 615 in the morning. The butters door between the basement and the kitchen was found a jar. And that door was just yards away from the spiral staircase where the ranzies were not just a door. And it goes on and on so they didn't do it. You own an apology. I'm going to call him if you don't give it to him. And don't go around here. It's anymore. Huh? Nope. Why not? Because I'm a bastard. I like to. I like to. Huh? I'm a hard bit. And I think they did it. So do I. What is this? Syria facts weapon. Oh yeah. It's right. Syria says they want to complete the weapons of master's destruction free middleies zone. What is that? No. We're going to see. Well, no, Israel's going to have all those nuclear weapons don't they? Right. Because they're the good guys. Especially on pace off. You don't want to call up aerial hero on a first day of Passover and say, hey, by the way, all them noops, Schmidt can't a man. No way. No way, Jose. Plus we got to get ready for that Syria pipeline. So Michael Moore and his book stupid white man in addition to telling us all the truth about the stolen 2000 election and all the other stuff that I read before. Just to show that he's fair in chapter 10 he says Democrats, DOA. And boys, he ever write. He assigned a bill providing for federal funds to be distributed to faith-based charitable organizations. He's expanded the number of federal crimes for which the death penalty can be given to a total of 60. He assigned to bill outlawing game marriages and is taking out ads on Christian radio stations, touting his opposition to any form of legal same-sex couplings. And a short span of time he's been able to kick 10 million people off welfare. That's 10 million out of 14 million total recipients. He has promised states bonus funds that they can reduce their welfare numbers further and made it easy to get these funds but not requiring the states to help the ex welfare recipients find jobs. He's introduced a plan that would bar any assistance to teenage parents that they drop out of school leave their parents home. Though he is careful not to draw attention to what he supports many of the old provisions of Newt King which is contract with America, including lowering the capital gain stacks. In spite of calls from Republican governors like George Ryan of Illinois to support a more term on capital punishment, he rejected all efforts to slow down the number of executions even effort was revealed that there are dozens of people on death through who are innocent. He has released funds for local communities to hire over 100,000 new police officers and supports laws that put people behind bars for life after committing three crimes even if those crimes were shopflot shoplifting were not paying for a pizza. There are now more people in America without health insurance than money took office. He has signed orders prohibiting any form of health care to poor people around the US illegally. He supports ban on late term abortions and promised to sign the first bill across his desk that includes an exemption only if the life of the mothers in jeopardy. He signed an order prohibiting any US funds going to any country to be used in helping women abortion. He signed a one year gag order that prohibits using any federal funds and foreign countries where birth control agencies mentioned abortion is an option to pregnant women. He has refused to sign the international land, buying ban treaty, already signed by 137 nations but not by Iraq, Libyan, or the US. He has scuttled a Kyoto protocol by insisting that sinks. In other words farmlands and forests, they countered toward the US percentage of emission reductions thus making a mockery of the whole treaty which was written primarily to reduce the carbon dioxide pollution from cars and factories. He has accelerated drilling for gas and oil on federal lands that have placed at matches and in some cases exceeds the production level during the Reagan administration. He has approved the sale of one California oil field in the largest privatization deal in American history and he opened the National Patrol in Reserve in Alaska something even Reagan was able to do. And he became the first president since Richardson, not to force the auto manufacturers to improve their mileage per gallon which would have saved millions of barrels of oil each day. Yes, you'd have to agree considering all of his above accomplishments that Bill Clinton was one of the best Republican presence we ever had. Excellent. And I'll just read two more sure paragraphs. He says, there's been much hand-winging since George W. Bush was given the office with good people and liberals everywhere freaked out that the son of a Bush would wreak havoc with the environment. Turn back the clock at women's rights and have us all be setting prayers and schools in a traffic light. They're right to be concerned. But Bush is only the ugly and somewhat meaner version of what we already had throughout the 90s, except that back then it came dressed in a charming smile from a guy who played soul tunes on a sex and told us what kind of underwear he and his interns were. We'd like that. It felt good and normal. He could sing the black national anthem. He parted with Gloria Steinem. He watched my show I like the guy's is Michael Moore. How do you like that? And he goes on a great life. To document so many of these things that he did. We're lost man. We got real tourists. I say Michael Moore for president. Because he gave too. Yeah, thank you, Lucky. Yeah. Now you might be surprised that my vote on a poll. I see already the results are pouring in. Now that he's pulled on your rages.com. 52 votes. In just a matter of moments, the most dangerous person in the world that they George Doubty is leading with 28. I didn't vote for W. That's why I voted for. I didn't. I'll tell you one second. Oh, son, if alive and ladden five. Dick Cheney if alive five and King Jung you'll have five. I voted for Dick Cheney. You wanted to win? I got an idea about George W. He's like to tag you. He's he should have known it was by seeing you all along. Yeah. I think he's running the country. That's why we've really seen because he's behind the scenes. Pulling all the strings and making sure the Hall of Britain gets those big conference to clean up the mess we've made. By the way, they'd like to add the lights back on and bag that sometimes this year before next to the circus. I will. I give it to you. That's what they want. They want some electricity back. Oh, guess what's on right now. Now you give up. Carry. One moment, please. I wrote it down here. It's beyond the seventh door. I think it's. I actually. Everyone. I think it's. I think it's. I have you see it. No. Don't drive and move each hour. I was thinking we just played the audio from that all day. It'd be very entertaining. After all of that tremendous energy, I had to reserve this morning. Anyway, let's see who else is getting some votes. Every else you're on's got four on Passover, no less. Oh, boy. He makes my skin call that fat turd militant. Turn burger. Side of me for life. Who's saying is only got one. I guess we figure he's day. That we already took care of him. Although we want to make sure his buddies don't go in the serial. We'll have to attack them and then Argentina. In fact, we're going to go in Argentina. Get some of those leftover Nazis to see what cabinet posts we can give him. Don't. The ramen spell's got one. And look at this wolf. What's in Richard Pearl have none. That bothers me a lot because it indicates to me that a lot of you people out there aren't reading our bedtime. They aren't keeping up with what's really going on in the world. What a shock that is. They don't know who they are. Huh? No, they don't know who they are. That's disturbing. Speaking of bubble though, and I got to do the break. See, so much material and so little time only till noon today. Because it's Wednesday. We got the noon to one comedy. But it's our, which we will continue by the way with the elected or not. Because more people like it than not, although it's close. We like it more than a point as we like it. And it gives us a nice break. Well, deserved. Especially if they have to bang my head all about a problem around on the floor here because the engineers never like that. Go out there where it says connection and reboot this and you know, stand on your head and stick 14 microphones in your ass and all the other. And nothing to do with it. As always, it's always the same thing. Why can't they just say our stuff down here sucks. We got a real mess down here, you know, and just admitted they can't do that because it's a reflection under great engineering work at Q a m. 942 at 562 a m. He just I'm telling. I've got a, I'm errosious about him now that Michael, what's his name? Michael Moore. I mean, what is his name? Michael Orlando. Mike Mark, Mark Morgan. I'm Mark Morgan. I'm Q a n. Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm listening to him. Oh, now, now. Well, I'll tell you if your carpet's are supposed to be enough to give you the shivers. Do something about it. Don't just sit there, look at him and be mown in your fate. Call my good friends at dry concepts. Like I always told you, and every business every industry there's one company. One person wants outfit, who's the best. And when it comes to cleaning your carpets and making them look just like brand new dry concepts beyond the shadow of a doubt, are the best. No axiom orders working for them. By the way, all their technicians are schooled and certified by the Institute of Inspection Painting and Restoration, they know their crap to make alongsteree short. And no matter how hopeless your carpets look, they'll come in your dry cleanem, which makes them look just like brand new smell remedy fresh. They're drying a couple of hours and you'll be amazed as you look around and say, holy crap, what happened here? And they give you written guaranteed price before they start to job. Soon, I have to worry about rip-offs about tack on's at the end. You'll have a real big smile like I said on your post. They also do us to punish job cleaning your poultry and drapery leather furniture. You're expensive area, you're a rugs and a renal carpet. You're flying carpets. If you have problems with pet orders and milled orders, caused by water damage, they'll work their magic. Or is that magic sound? That little thing. We're on a... That's right. Just like that, dot concepts will do it for you. Calm, toll-free. What is that, under is that in my thing? No. I just put it on my bank because a magic one sound effect. I want it. Okay. And if I've told you once, you'll have many times I've told you. But third of me. Right now, I want that to 1-800-248-5071. 1-800-248-5071. Or long under their website and find out all about the fantastic work they do. Dragconcepts.com. When you call these folks, drag concepts, you really can clean today and entertain tonight. My life and local. This is for Shredial-Fight City. Way to way. Yeah. You got six feet. Oh, don't you feel a year? This is my head. Yeah. Did you see that? The whole of it. Did you want to play Soldier just like the real guys? Now you can have tons of fun playing war with the new Nerf Smart Bomb. Just program the terrorists you want to kill. I'll play General Tommy Franks and you're a sedan who's saying. But I don't want to be sedan-off. And the Nerf Smart Bomb will follow that dirty terrorist until he's all blown up. Here it comes. I don't have a! Isn't that fun? You can get rid of all the kids that don't agree with your views. Once you get the Nerf Smart Bomb, it's smart and it's a bomb. I think the technical person of pace-off is falling on my finger to there. Punch the button and just kind of like sat there. Look at me. Like you can't me. 9.48.12.10. It's 5.60. QM got the mad dog at one. We got the homperate 3 in the studio. And I heard he was on yesterday. He said it okay to me. He had a young thing. I don't know if I am. I'll back to you. Here's a thing. He had a thing. I don't know if he wants to discuss on the air. He didn't sound like he wanted to discuss on the air. So, uh... Was he a ham-words? No. Was it... Here we'll do charades. Look what I'm doing. Well, no, I don't know. You shouldn't have said that. He had a thing because it makes me nervous. Was it a serious thing? No, no. Little Lain's had myotics take care of it. Oh, no. Nothing like that. Come on, you're just making an uphill. I have like a... Crouch crickets. Anyway, Hank, I'll be on a three-hilted all about it. I'd like some kind of an STD. Uh, I thought you put that in the crankcase. Six-dirty-athmarlins on direct-several five-marlins of the police, any can, to the baseball from G.A. and Joe Markov and I. And then, of course, in a morning, it's a small and gullier-grink-closed personal buddies. Not. John and Portsein Lucy, you're right on target as usual. Man, he says, Shouldn't John Ashcroft be handed to the pole and you are... Absolutely correct. The police is dangerous to Americans as rums colours to the middle of easterners, everybody else. John Ashcroft, get him on their right away, Eric. Call up, Eric, and make sure he gets him on their Carlos. So, what kind of a... a video-real-de-sease was? I mean... Then, here's the facts about the mo talking about how he and Gully had a pretty good compared to you and Manduk, regard to the idiot callers. See, it's not a question. They don't rate us on a Carlos' reggae, well, I know that comes as a bad, the piece of news to you. And in addition, which we don't do that heavy screening, in fact, we're doing screenlessly on this show. We still don't give a crap, you know? Right. We don't care because we're not uptight and super sensitive, like some other people out there, like we got a call from about the bullfighting everybody. It's all indignant and bent out of shape. Oh, yeah, there you go. Huffin' and puffin'. Huh? It says for George Wallace talking religion today, W.W.W.J.D. who wouldn't George do? Probably a short list. So, I'm going back to Baba. Clinton blast US approach to international affairs. And if anybody knows about them affairs, it's Baba. And I don't care, you know, the stuff I just read from Michael Moore's book, and it's all true, but nevertheless, I don't care what anybody says, including Michael Moore. If I have to choose, if I have my brothers, or Sally Corrothers would say, if I had my brothers, I'd like to have Baba in there right now. In fact, I'd like to turn a clock back many, many months, and have had him in there. Former US president Bill Clinton blasted US foreign policy adopted the wake of 9, 11 attacks arguing. The US cannot kill jail or occupy all of its adversaries. Our paradigm now seems to be something terrible happened to us on 9, 11, and that gives us the right to interpret all future events in a way that everyone else in the world must agree with us at Clinton, who spoke at a seminar of governance organized by conference board. Why? Why? By some kind of, I don't know what that is. Is there a word left off in there? Whatever. And if they don't think, go straight to Halley said, they don't agree with us. That, I guess, is the opinion, Washington, right? They can go straight to Hall. Right. The Democratic former president who preceded George W.W.J.D. the White House said that sooner or later the US had to find a way to cooperate with the world at large. We cannot run Clinton pointed out if you've gotten independent world and you cannot, what? If you've got an independent world, you cannot kill jail or occupy all of your adversaries. Soon or later, you have to make a deal. You said he believed Washington overreacted a German in French opposition, US finds remote interaction against Iraq, and suggested that the court administration had trouble juggling foreign and domestic issues. Since 9, 11, it looks like we can't hold two guns at the same time. He said, if you fight terrorism, you can make America better place to be. Clinton said that if he were at the White House right now, he would scrap a $726 billion tax cut proposal made by the president in January to stimulate the flagging economy, yada yada yada. Today's our heads to the public say. That's going to do any good, but that's what he's saying. He's open enough a big push. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. Most dangerous person in the world that age George W.W.F.57 votes. Dick Cheney, if a lie of 18, we'll check. Kim Jong-il 16, Osama, if a lie been lied in 16, more Howard David if a lie of 10, are yals your own and down the rum spell, he'd have 7 pull off of its three-retured proletu, Sodom if a lie of who's saying won, I guess he's small potatoes now, and John Ashcroft just went on 137 votes. WQAM. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon, Marlos line. Pat Scott their tons this morning, George. I guess it's all bedtime stories till noon today. We're just right at it, I forgot it's past so we're not going to get no calls today. But how like him? WQAM? John Bob? WQAM? Yes, I thought I'd have Rupert Murdoch who was a deal's list. That's a good choice. Since he's manipulating most of the news, okay, thank you. Rupert Murdoch, get him on Eric. He's probably busy with the breakfast burritos right now. Probably got one on each hand and a burrito too. Rupert Murdoch, man who dares to feed you a pile of crap and smiles about it and runs all the way to the bank. WQAM? Maybe we can get most of the misfits to call in daylight. So we got the lady. We got chronic aloe. We got Steve, a stuttering Steve. You got, uh, what's a one? You got one? Man. What a stupid, but the boot is flaking. Too bad we can't have the best time. I feel I'm going to fill up to talk about the bullfighting, right? Too bad we can't get your, our crawly callers on here. As I started to say, only moments ago we've been for interrupted myself. Nobody cares about that. Mo, they care about those numbers and a week from Friday. We'll see since you're comparing yourself to me in a mad dog. Which is kind of laughable to begin with. We'll see. Who's got a number or not? And of course we have the added liability already. We've been getting the money already of pissing off all the, the bushletters and the, the warmongers, but that's okay. We'll take the chance. And in spite of that, we'll still see who's got the bigger one. A week from Friday. Can you imagine the, a reputation that old man's bag that's going on right now? He won't admit it. You're in the, yeah. WQIM. Hey, New High is doing that. Okay, sir. Good morning. You listen, a real quick before I go on my little tent from the Philadelphia, I'll be for a couple of minutes. Uh, who's that? Oh, turn it man. Who's that? Oh, turn it man. Who's that? Who's that? That's old dirty vaster. 30. We call it. Okay. Anyway, we are quick. We'll be for our after going to work. Uh, I turn on the news. I don't know if you guys have talked about it. I mean, it's been able to listen much. I already worried if you've been, damn actors. So that's the last week's news. We talked about that last week. I've got the latent Grammys. They're starting up the same old, Turned, Turned, like I said, neurotic repetition. Nothing ever changes there. The more things change the more they stay the same. The same old, Bonanipot mentality, The same threats and the same turning off the rest of the world. You know, that's that's our burden. You own a county in the world. That's got it. I'm a human and I'm a Democrat. And you just say, I have many people that don't stick to me in my family. You know, because I'm a fat and I'm a communist. I'll wrap them with a warning. Of course. You know what? Through them. I'll keep going. I'm wound up to grow. I've been here opening here to grow. Hey, Holly, what's coming along real nice, actually. You're too young to live in Hollywood, man. Now we're pushing the old farts out. Yeah. I got a lot of stuff. I got a lot of stuff. I got a lot of stuff. I got a lot of stuff. Worked up and worked up and. Yeah, that's old nose, the Latin Grammys. They're start up the same old tire crab. I don't know about anybody else. But I know I mentioned it. But as far as I'm concerned, it's just they just won me out. They nothing shocks us anymore. Nothing surprises or whatever. We never say, oh, gee, they're doing this again. Because we know they're going to do it again. As soon as I heard the Latin Grammys work. I thought to myself, why? Because they're going to encounter the same crab. They always do in Dave County. You got a little bit of a public there in At Tomas Regalato, a professional spent this stirber, starting the same crab. Let me say this, okay, it wasn't the Cuban singers. It wasn't the performers from Cuba who executed those three dissidents. Those, well, actually, they were the hijackers. And who was punishing all the dissidents down there. Right now, they didn't do it. I know that comes as a great surprise to you. They're not the ones responsible. But they're singing commisons. Yeah, but, you know, it's the usual brilliant mentality. Lump them all in together, right? Except when the Pope went there, he was still a good guy. When he was on the stage with the del comparing war drops. And head gear. 9.56 and 5.60. WQM. You don't have to put on a fancy dress to go to Pompano Park all you guys. The Panthers had done for the season. The heat might as well be and Colis Basca, Volphanito. Marlon's off to another very rocky start. And then Alphan's don't get started for another three months. But the good news is, there's still some live action going on where you could be a big winner. Pompano Park up and for live harness racing Wednesday, Friday and Saturday like tonight. First post time, 715, 3 general parking free admission as well. In fact, maybe they got some pacific he can't do it in for your Pompano Park tonight. Come out to Pompano and drive the thrill of nighttime horse racing action.

All of these things and lots more waiting for it. Pompano Park, a blast-out-of-the-line and bullet-of-art on powerline roads. Nine, and low, six is four trillion, five sixty. What do you mean, Adam? Don't have a penis. Look at congratulations, get a life. I'm a form and on a construction crew. So one of my guys comes to me with a problem. It's my job to help. That's why I always recommend pojak green. Projak is a strong anti-yage anti-rash cream that works hard. All made protecting your delicates. And applying projak is easy. Simply unzip and remove your goods. Librally apply the cool soothing pat and projak oil and along the entire outside, like so. And I always like to take an extra dab and add it to my middle finger. It's slipping in here like this. Ah. That gives me extra protection to my sensitive teeth. The crotch area between my bag and tailpipe. There. All done. So I thank you from an open structured worker. Why fun? Projak green today. Hey. What do you need some gold? Projak anti-yage cream. Tough enough for him. Tough enough for you. 10, 100, 100, 50, 60. Now why would the hump or not want us to talk about what he had? I don't know. Huh? What's the sensitive about the sensitive area? Area? Yeah. Are you in a retract infection? Is the sensitive area? Yeah. What's infected? Yeah. But I don't get that. That's not a sexually transmitted disease, which is what you were saying before. Okay. Is it Carl? Is that what he said? He said, hey, can't this the clap or something? Yeah, crabs. I think is what he said. He said, yeah, he was crabby in the hand of the clap. He was working on the clapper to try to get the full working. That's what our engineers do. They stand in the corner and go like that. Just try to get the equipment working. That's what we're working on. And you're in a retract infection. What happened? What happened? Is that it? Like my mother and Hank and me and I've had your most had a whole bunch of those. Oh, you can make? He's a pusher. Here's a fact that says clear channel stations are running spots from Calvary Chapel about how we're living in such troubled times. Of course, I wonder what they hooked those up to, you know? Probably the donkey's. Black dome, I don't know. Times says in a country where the mentally ill can't own a gun, we allow a moron to control our war machine. Good point, Tom. Very well said. The unfifactor by Lloyd Grove on the Associated Press. It says maybe Bill Oralea should declare a no quips on. Emceeing Saturday night's best friends Rock and Roll Gaila at the Murriad Wardman Park, which raised 800 grand for the 15-year-old charity benefiting inner city school children, the Fox News Channel Star Oralea was trying to fill dead air during a low on the entertainment. Members of the best man is the 6th of 8th grade boys in the program are called, where late getting on stage and perform a lip sync rendition of the four top-stated reach out and I'll be there. Oralea had lived. Does anyone know where the best man are? I hope they're not in the parking lot stealing our hubcaps. Oh, good one. Many in the audience, which included the Cabinet Secretary Tommy Thompson, the cheesehead, Gail Norton and Mel Martinez, Mayor Tony Williams and business type strike Malach and Jim Kimsey, apparently didn't hear about the hubcapsum into Hubbub. A witness spotted a tindi boat jurid, there is jaw drop in yesterdays she confirmed she did hear it, but to climb to comment further, Channel 9 anchor that's WR anchor and we are wrong with overhead murmuring. Unbelievable. To say that, this conservative audience dominated undoubtedly by many of Mr. Oralea's biggest fans was aghast, is an understatement one attend the email that's asking for anonymity, the one on Republican politicians and their spouses seated at on your my table were a Paul. Yesterday Oralea told us this is ridiculous and foolish. No good deed goes unpunished. If you guys want to snipe it me then snipe it me this thing raised a lot of money for a good charity, everybody was happy. I don't want to come on anything else. Shari doesn't. Wow. There you go, Bill Oralea. At least he didn't sing. Hmm. He didn't sing that. That probably wasn't really bad. Made a really punished him then. Probably taking his show off the year. 560560, palm 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. The real fact of the matter I think Alison is North Korea desperately needs money. Their economy is in chatters. They're looking for long-term aid from the United States and the international community. They're not prepared to give up their nuclear program, which the CIA says has the North Koreans with at least two nuclear weapons. And of course they started that reactor which is providing a weapons grade plutonium. We got to do his bribe of that sounds good. A few billion here, a few billionaires small potatoes. We had lots of money to throw around evidently. WQAM. Good morning. Yes, I am. I like to talk to Neil, please. Speaking. You Neil? Yes, I am. Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I've had something in the news yesterday that is very depressing. I don't know if you talked about it. Rick Sanchez is coming back to Miami in July. Why? To do why? Oh, they said he might be working on Channel 6. Oh, so in other words, he's getting dumped back down just like, what's your name? Like Michel Gillen. Yeah, and another one they used to offer. They're ready. Yeah, they're the clown from Channel 4. And they said they don't think about three months ago, but then they go back as you know, during the war. But they didn't put him under in order to put a shuttle them over to CNBC to do like little update on. Yeah, but they might be back. Well, you heard about his squatting over the map as Capade's during the first before he said no, don't put that check, I saw him. So Rick Sanchez is coming back to South Florida. What did I tell you? The more it's changes, the more it's there. No, I know that's why I have to call you when you say that. I have to call you. Thanks for the bad news. Okay, how's the good day? In YouTube. I already have a homosexual relationship with Neil. So I might as well have one with you too. Oh, he has really hit the big time. Yeah. All that hyperventilating hysteria that the phony that fake. Yeah. Now, I guess what he thought about that phone call. He made two on when he ran a causeway. The entourage going over to sister jeans house. Oh, yeah. When he threatened, I remember that. We breathlessly tried to interrupt. See, here's a guy doesn't want to report the news. He wants to make the news. Kind of like Elliot Rodriguez over there in Channel 4 news, which I don't watch any more by the way, under penalty of death, even with Angela Rae there, especially with Angela Rae there. She's the one who done it. She's the one who put me over the edge. Oh, you as president George Bush calls him proof that Iraq was harboring terrorists in the same. Oh, well, well, well, well, it's right. There you go. Have we found any weapons of mass destruction yet? No. I just ask him passing. Somebody made a point yesterday that if they don't find not only weapon to mass destruction, but a very sizable amount, they're going to have one hell of a hard time justifying all of this carnage and this invasion, all these things is what they said. Is this meant to that in passing as well for your perusal? WQAM? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. What was that website yesterday you had with the, with the article about what happened from 1990s that all concorced? What happened to your one? You had this, you reading from a website you said from like from in the early 90s, all these warm-ongers had this whole big plan. Oh, he's talking about that story. You're talking about the story about Pinex. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Would you get me with a winner? I want to forward that to a couple of people that use this. One moment please. Don't tell me I don't still have that George. One moment please. One moment please. One moment please. You have to sit here. And at the hour WQAM. Okay. I'll be glad you guys in 27 degrees in the rock. Here it is. Village voices that was from the Chapel Hill News. Now, what website did I find that on Carlos? What's on our website? What am I talking about? It was on our website. Right. From yesterday's bedtime story. So you can go to our, you got to computer obviously. Obviously. Go to our website and then click on the features page, which has the stories, the bedtime stories from past days. The headline on it is village voices by Mark Mark Coppolis. Thank you sir. And thank you because I'm going to read it again today. We did again. And which fanches is that guy still bed to see it? Yes. And why is he still called pro player stadium? Yes, anybody anybody? Go to your while, internet. Seems to me that the audience is just catching up on a lot of old news. You know what? Well, whatever. To respond it with tear gas. Protesters are upset with you countries that supported the war in Iraq. Village voices by Mark Mark Coppolis. I'm ready, mention it because I showed it over into my way off the side. I got a bunch of stuff that I saved and I would not have thought of reading it. I'm sure you wouldn't have reminded me to read it again today. No, we did it again today. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. They're in a column aboard. I'm doing a little screenless here today. We got that big noon to one hour come up and there's the call because it's even the going. I guess it's celebrating pizza. You glad you did this. But all that time making sure the phones work. I spent an hour down here. I was flooring around and banging my head. We were banging our heads all over the wall trying to figure out what was wrong here. And just so you people have been having your say. Calling and having your say. Things are really often vague. I mean, what's going on here? Yeah. There he goes again. You're that Carlos? He said something about his gay. WDQAM? Yeah, guys. Speaking. How are you doing now? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? Pretty good. Good. What's up? He said the United States is going to veto the Syrian proposal for weapons The fire suppression for you. When you say veto the proposal, I mean they're just talking. There isn't going to be any such proposal. You think that we're going to take away all the nuclear weapons from Israel? Do you really believe in Egypt? We're going to take away all their stuff? No. I mean, we did shut down the pipeline yesterday. I think that's like almost like an act of war. Yeah. The pipeline leading from Iraq to Syria. They use for their own consumption. We're concerned about the pipeline that goes to a high-fifths. That's what we're worried about. Yeah. I mean, I'm not a Republican, but I don't support Bush. God bless you, man. Right, right in Michael Moore's name on a ballot next year. You know, there's a really good article. Kind of like an afterthought. Where does it come from? Tom Payne. Yeah, ballots can keep bullets from flying. That's on our website. I'm sure that B.N.R.B.N. boys got all of those stories up there already. He's not. He does? No. I don't think so. He's nodding my ass. That was up there though. Ballets can keep bullets from flying or called a register for peace. Elizabeth ready, who's your 12 years in a Vermont Senate. And his now in a second term is Vermont's auditor of accounts. She writes a circle on TomPain.com.com and since good website. I won't get to that, okay? And she's right. All the people that are really cravin' it and they've had the only problem. I would ask you this. Who are we going to vote for? Bloss, for a. Huh? Seriously, I mean, I was certainly going to vote for anybody, but Bush does of us who are are appalled by this. I'm suggesting. I know. That's something about right-of-man. That'd be kidding. At least he's got a good sense. I'm starting to like pat behind him. Yeah. As grotesque as he isn't many, many ways. He'd like to fry my ass in the oven. Never, never less. He's starting to look like I hell of a lot better than some. I can think of. Not to mention any names. Just even to read. Bad the hairpiece. 1013 at 5.60.

On the acupointing for the opening of the new album, we know bring you some who say no. I have been cut off from the outside world and have not been able to do my laundry for a very long time. I am presently wearing in old wedding gown and a push-up bra. Later on this afternoon, I will be chatting on AOL. T-word, Sudam, the cross to the server. 1017-560. Of course you've heard all the stories about how we made the secret deal in the Russians. Took him off in a convoy for an exchange for a sadams for freedom. Yes. I'm going to get to it momentarily. I'm going to get to it momentarily. I'm going to get to it momentarily. I'm going to get to it momentarily. I'm going to get to it momentarily. How about the seeds for a list? How about the castaways? The Greg Reid saw. The more Howard David it saw. But they didn't make the cut. T-word. History up in Smoke writes more in doubt in today's New York Times. Last week the CIA was leading toward believing that Saddam Hussein was alive and Osama Bin Laden was dead. This week the CIA is leading toward believing that Osama Bin Laden is alive and Saddam Hussein is dead. Unless of course Saddam is not dead. Even though Tommy France trains to have Saddam's DNA, American forensics experts have not been pying to the rubble of the Baghdad's safe house in restaurant where Saddam and his sons were targeted in the April 7th, are pretty good clue that they didn't expect to find any Saddam traces there. And last night rumors were flitting through the intelligence community that Saddam may be on the run after plastic surgery. The man is known to be an official auto of cosmetic enhancement. He requested liposuction, teeth whitening, and hair transplant equipment through UN officials. In 1998 as humanitarianists we have not found any weapons of mass destruction is because all that botulinum tax needs to be stored wasn't to make biological weapons as Paul said, but Botox. What a saddam never intended to defend Baghdad. What if he plotted a body heat ending where a look alike would be blown up on he escaped to a secluded tropical beach? It wouldn't have been so difficult while he went under the knife and underground operating room or in Syria. He could have put on old video tapes on Iraqi TV and set out doubles to do walkabouts in the wacky information minister to do lieabouts. It always seems suspicious that at the height of the bombing campaign in Baghdad with American forces ringing the city that Saddam strode on the Baghdad, Bada Beng, flanked by relatives and top aides. Whether the techy tarot is Moad Dust or has a new face he's gone. And we now own his country for the bargain down payment of $79 billion. America broke away from the British Empire and now it's built against own British style empire. We are as now for we obviously have something to learn from the British when they carted off treasures of the nations they conquered to the British Museum. They at least preserved them for future generations to fight over who should own them. The coalition forces regarding the Iraqi oil ministry building while hundreds of Iraqis ransacked and went off with precious heirlooms and artifacts from a 7,000 year old civilization. Rummy blew off the repeated request of Scotters' archaeologist that the soldiers must protect Iraqi history in the museum as zealous as zealotry and let me say it again. Rummy blew off the repeated request of Scotters' archaeologist that the soldiers must protect Iraqi history in the museum as zealous ways they protected Iraqi wealth in the oil wells. Bad reading the old sorry. The Secretary of Defense Miniclaw yesterday that it was not too worried about a few old pots and big scheme of things. He said it was a stretch to attribute the looting of the museum to a defect in the war plan. We've seen looting in this country he said it's Pentagon briefing. We've seen riots at soccer games in various countries around the world to the extent that it happens in a war zone. It's difficult to stop. The government should have taken 20 seconds when it was awarding the Haliburton contract to protect the art of books in the hospital supplies. Even when they had the museum as an awful example, the world planners let more of Iraqis, Priceless intellectual history be destroyed as looters and arsonists ransacked into their fate just because we don't want to be an empire. Doesn't mean we have to be utterly lacking in grand door just because the leaders who prosecuted this war were oilmen doesn't mean they have to prosecute the war like wellmen. Leonard Wolf, Virginia Wolf's husband, was sent to a government partisan salon in the early 20th century in resigned, discouraged about the difficulties of occupation. The most in imperial administration could hope to do we say with the rent people from killing one another or robbing one another or burning down the camp. And that's the least we must do says marine dowels. And today's New York Times. And I've got marine. And is it interesting? Her good point she makes is that they weren't going through the rubble there to find traces of Sodom so we'd have some DNA. Her. Huh? Or even a see if we could find a body. They weren't like pulling through that rubble. In other words, he wasn't there. But there were some families there, and of course now, well, they're dead. I just mentioned that in passing. Then I was lucky as Ali. Good old lucky Ali, man. He's doing great. That's a good nickname for it. Lucky Ali. Mm-hmm. Yeah, like that dog lucky. You know the one that's blind and no one like missing. Sure. No tail. No ears. Lucky. Hey, lucky. Honestly, I can hear me. Robert, I don't want to read too many bedtime series because that's like going back to that stuff again. But I have I feel compelled as spirit of somebody compels me. The spirit of Michael Moore compels me. But we'll take some great calls and be twisted between WQAM. So what I mean? Right. That's cool. Yeah. Huh? Now come on. We had a couple of good nights. Oh, we're good. Don't be so you're so negative. No. What's wrong with you? By the way, was 83 here yesterday, the height of the day is going to be 46. That's true. And tomorrow 35. And then we'll warm up on a weekend. We like the little variety. You know, we don't want that constant. Just little varieties good. WQAM. Hello. Yes, man. Hello. Good. You know, I've been having trouble getting through. I wanted to tell you what I called about yesterday was the same thing that woman called about Rick Sanchez. Yeah. Actually, she neglected to tell you the funniest part of the article. Okay. It says the reports of Sanchez leaving MSNBC with published Monday in the news. Luzette, a daily Orlando base newspaper. Newsletter. Why'd we circulate it? The newsletter called Sanchez quote, a vamping type of ventilating tabloid bread Rick head. Oh, no, no specific explanation why he might be leaving the cable news channel. I love it. And on the subject of Roger Lieberman in today's Harold, I mean, I got some some stuff that's snuster here on the comic stage of all things. That's where he belongs. The boondocks. As presidential hopeful Joseph Lieberman met with President Bush today at the White House. According to Ari Flisher, the president strongly encouraged Lieberman to switch from his usual tidy, whiny underwear to more flattering silk boxers. Wait. It's better.

I'd like to know who he's talking about. Other than me in Randy, can you name another little not just talking in the local market? Or in the area? Any other liberal talk show host on radio in the country? Name me one real fast? No. Time's up. This is bad news that you just facts to me. It says, don't know if you saw or heard this did not see this in the newspaper post? Comical Ali death of a legend. It could be more of a Iraqi information minister Muhammad Saeed al-Sahab's trademarked this information, but there were reports yesterday that committed suicide. Oh no. And he was just getting ready to take over to Mosho. You answer me, pray for your mode. At least till my Friday. To our rainy newspaper is reported that Sodom's notorious spin-mise to who was outlandish briefings on the stage of the Iraq War in Tim the nickname, Comical Ali, hanged himself shortly after the fall of Baghdad last week. The newspaper said the story of Al-Sahab suicide came from unnamed Iraqi War refugees in the town of Deloran. The reports that Al-Sahab was ordered to stay at his post and continue to give the impression that Sodom was in control even while other regime leaders and military commanders were fleeing. He was said to hang himself last Wednesday hours after US forces took control of Baghdad. Are these reports accurate over the planned by the minister of this information himself in the hope that US forces won't look for him? Well, whatever no I guess. That would be a shame when it came. He was one of the few guys we like to still have around. Plus all of Savayans, by the way, most of them. So I mean we'd be marked mark-mark-hopeless thing now or later. I think I want to do it now. Both. No, I don't. Robert Shiraw, I want to do now. Huh? I didn't say I'm not going to do both. And then we got to strip out Elizabeth's smart in the inquiry. Says she was not the kid that she ran away. That's the defense for this comeback, by the way. Brian Mitchell, let's go to the defense. Is that she was, is she ran away with him? And she was not kidnapped. And the knife was just to cut through the screen on a window and to get in. And for cheese. Then we got the poor American idol. He's a, Brian, secret. He's a real pussy. I've an Bentley. Get into a fight in the barn. He said he fought like a woman. Snacks. He fights like a sissy. What it said. Well, at least he's a fight natural anyway. Steve McQueen was murdered. That's also in the inquiry. Plans docked in a new blocker. And above the book, he was murdered a cover to perpetuate the scale of cancer treatment in America. Because he was going to blow the lid on him about how these alternatives were working for him. Wrong. But anyway. Robert Sheer writes in today's Los Angeles Times, how telling that US forces so carefully protected in my soil fields while ignoring the looting of Baghdad internationally renowned museum, the complete and by all accounts preventable destruction of one of the world's most significant collections of antiquities is a fit metaphor for current US policy which causes more serious damage to carelessness than calculation. The notion that Iraq even has history, let alone that 7,000 years ago this line was the cradle of civilization, is not likely to occur to the neoculomest running or brony young nation, barely more than 200 years old. The United States earnest instances the charm that our entertainment industry markets so successfully around the world, but it is also the perennial seat of disaster as we blightly rearrange corners of the planet we only pretend to understand. To Donald Rumsfeld, the widespread looting that is ravaged hospitals, libraries and museums in Iraq was simply further proof the US invasion of this fractured Muslim country represents liberation. Freedom's untidy, he said, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes, translation, you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet. It almost sounds as if the defense secretary is projecting out of the looters of black and excuse for deadly errors the White House and US military have made and will continue to make an Iraq alienating allies, killer civilians, hand-picking, craving and corrupt Iraqi leaders who haven't been in the country for decades. This, after all, the distillation of the Bush doctrine, free countries are free to commit mistakes and commit crimes and unfree countries. One wonders whether Rumsfeld was since such tolerance to the United States' own toolmen in prisoners. Surely he wouldn't dismiss her country's long history of urban riots as an example of untidyness of freedom? It's only an Iraq that we believe to quote a song Janice Joplin made famous that freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. The admittedly awesome display of US military power or the slew of false testifications used to unleash it. The imminent threat of Iraq's use of weapons of destruction now likely to be proven non-existent or the unsubstantiated claim that Iraq is linked to 911, qualifies the US to remake a nation with which we have absolutely no affinity. If Iraq needs a foreign midwife to assist in its rebirth, it should be out of the broader sponsorship of the United Nations Security Council, which our macho president continues to disparage for having failed to vote our way. Well, the democracy we so-flipply promote for Iraq be pushed aside if it's simply fails to produce results to our liking? Egor to rebuild their country after years of misrule will Iraq is really swallowed the shameless plans of Bush and Siders to privatize your Mackey oil while the administration awards billions of dollars in contracts US companies? And what if Iraqi Muslim fundamentalists prove a successful at the polls as radicals in Algeria, where the US only mildly rebuked the repressive regime for smashing a popularly elected but the aquatic opposition? If the new Iraq follows the path of Pakistan and Turkey where the populists inclined to obliterate any wall between state and church, will the US spin this as a victory for democracy? Well, Ramosfeld justifies the ethical cleansing, common in the nation-driven with competing tribes, plans, and religious sects arbitrarily packed together by previous Colombia's rulers as the unruly joy or freedom? Why have the media bought the administration's propaganda that we come to Iraq with clean hands and virgin swords to slay the dragon and sottam Hussein when the US did so much to keep him in power? Surely even embedded journalists recall that it was Reagan's administration's special envoy Ramosfeld, who met with Hussein in the 80s to guarantee US support for Iraq's war with Iran. Once again, we're deep in the nation-building again that Bush decandidate railed against in 2000. Having blundered in guns blazing, we should now play to win the peace slowly backing out inviting a true multinectional rebuilding effort with support from the UN and Muslim countries. And for Heaven's sake, can we remember in our next preemptive invasion to assign at least a few of our tanks to protect the hospitals and museums? It's Robert Chirin yesterday's LA time. He's good. But you know, you left his liberals out there and left coast. That's that LA time left coast. Somebody, in fact, the other day, my wife said, what's so bad about being a liberal? The answer is nothing, absolutely positively nothing. But you got to hand it to the right wingers. They conserved it as a call to whatever you want to be public goods. You got to hand it to them because they've made the word liberal and that's one of them. So that almost nobody in a congress team will ever use that term for any other than Ted Kennedy, can you tell me anybody who described themselves as a liberal? No. So dirty word man, they succeeded in that. Just like they succeeded in sticking with 2000 election. And so seeding, turning the Democrats into a bunch of whimps. Bitches. Whimps and bloody bitches. Speaking of bitches, don't forget Friday the beast will be in. He and I will have our way off. I have a phony, I may do better in him this week. I could be wrong. I think I might just be the amount. But I started at $192.5. Yes, sir. We'll see how he does this Friday. As the great QM slim down continues, well, thanks got that you're in a reaction. That probably cost me an answer to. If you want to lose some weight, balance for life is the way to go. Look at the beast man. He looks a lot better than he used to. He's still a big fat tub. He's got a long way to go. But he's off to a good start. He's lost 60 pounds. How many more do you think he can lose by summer time? About 30 man. It was right the easiest, the least way with balance for life because number one it tastes great. Number two it works. Number three it's easy even if you're as simple as you don't have to count any calories or carbs. You don't even have to go shopping. Just sit there on your fat ass. All you do is choose between two alternatives reach me every day that you run a program this and you little man you pick what you like. And that's it. Every day by six in a AM they delivered you a little black sack. In your black sack all the food you need to keep you satisfied all day long. Three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks that I want to emphasize. Nothing frozen nor artificial ingredients nothing in little prefab box. Everything is fresh and delicious made with the breast ingredients you'll find anywhere. And like I said, it'll keep you satisfied with a big smile on your post while I wait pours off. So you know it's no fun being fat. Your sick you look like crap lose that way with balance for life like the beast is doing a lot of others doing his audience call nine five four five six eight thirty two twenty nine nine five four five six eight thirty two twenty nine and once and for all take it off and keep it off or check them out of the web if you like it balance for life dot clock clock clock ownちょっと There's a Pick up a phone in every hands home A call is C-I-A Just wink, not one one Get it done With these commercial way Judging bombs Made by creeps Judging bombs Made her cheeky Judging bombs Find these creeps Judging bombs And the made by creeps Judging bombs made by dirty creeps Gas chamber Deep on injection Firing squaw Get these creeps And step them in Electric chair I won't teach Get these creeps Let me ask you a question What ever happened to Josep Hadia speaking of dirty bombs?

Doesn't matter if we find any or if they have any no cuz we just make it up Oh, we know we had they have been so does everybody else US allies also have weapons of mass destruction this article in Ananova Syria's the latest target of US accusations over weapons of mass destruction But the list of states with chemical biological or nuclear arms also extends to several US allies Oh The US and Britain cited a racially alleged alleged stocks of weapons of mass destruction their decision to invade and George Bush now says Syria's also sitting on an arsenal of chemical weapons But among the nations believe that WMD capability our states the US may not consider hostile like Israel Egypt, Pakistan, India and Taiwan and happy pace off the wall of our friends in India John Bolstall deputy director of the non proliferation project of the US Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said We tend to look the other way when it suits our interest that decision is come back to haunt us Israel's nuclear weapons program is not to conclude about 200 warheads deployed on ballistic missiles and aircraft We'll still said Is ready official to not comment on the country's nuclear weapons potential to this mention and nuclear submarines no, but that's also part of it yet Egypt another US allies believed the harbor chemical weapons along including deadly Syrian and Vx agents along with perhaps an offensive Biowepens capability according to the moderated independent international studies Indian Pakistan have publicly tested nuclear weapons as we all know They also are suspected to be engaged in chemical and biological weapons research according to Carnegie and Monterey The entire one probably maintains a chemical weapons program and may have a biological research program according to Monterey Saudi Arabia has bought nuclear capable intermediate range missiles from China although the Saudis are not believed to have Unconventional warheads to put them in most all said Other countries with current chemical and biological weapons stocks are research programs include of course Russia China Libya and Sudan according to the Carnegie Endowment think of that rational countries not rogue ones like Libya Good rational hands Sudan are the ones that have it we can trust them right US and Britain developed their own chemical and biological weapons in the past Britain Is destroyed all such stocks and the US is still eliminating the last vestiges of its chemical weapons said any Smithson of the Henry L.

Charles for the center Now, seriously, this ought to be we ought to leave it on with our current stories every day for like many many days to come You don't agree. Yeah. Yeah, we can have a perfect place for it. Yeah, I'll bet Back home Mark Mark Koppel is in the chapel. It'll lose rights village voices media failure I read this twice yesterday. We did again will be overkill as we said in a rack overkill, but you know what to bed? Maybe I'll read it better Or maybe not Mark says it's reported that more than half of Americans believe that Saddam Hussein is responsible for the terrorist attacks of 9-11 This means that the US media have utterly spectacularly shamply and patheticly failed One of the most interesting aspects of this war has been the overall superiority of the internet as a source of news In many cases, of course, this actually means access to news reports from all the world's media except the United States To the majority of the world citizens who oppose the war really just hate freedom or are they getting better information At any rate without the internet, we are truth deprived In one sense the US mainstream media has proved their totally relevant sees an accurate information source Tragedically, it's worse than that. They've proven that they have neither the professional journalist Integrity nor the individual ethical foundation resisting and listed a supporter war that they have all people are Whereas based on lies First off, argue war drum beaters and troops supporters out there sending you out-raged letters All I ask is that you provide a shred of relvenants of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq Or tell the readers that the bush above didn't lie about the forged documents before him to prove Iraq had a nuclear program Or the plagiarized California grad student's thesis that colon Powell claim came from unimpeachable sources Or the aluminum tubes that nobody in the world considered evidence of nuclear weapons construction Not even the Pentagon fundamentalists who cynically put forth his nonsense I urge you to write but spare me the sanctimonious unpatriotic smearing and give me some facts And please don't tell the support the troops bait and switch game the carbor abort of Alderman guts Look at that one even going so far to say they wanted the troops to have all the logistical support They need to complete their jobs Translation now that you're stuck fighting a war that we already understand to be illegal and unnecessary We will stand by quietly while you kill thousands of Iraqis not only young men and boys in the Iraqi army But more than a thousand innocent people and wound many thousands more including young children with their arms blown off or blided by a Shrapnel and we will stand by quietly while you die get wounded or psychologically warped Supporting the troops apparently does not include opposing use of depleted uranium shells that ruined the lives of tens of thousands of Gulf War veterans And we'll do the same this go around with Burley a mention in the media Those so intend on supporting the war effort to the expense of authentic journalism Not to mention the hell of experience of war itself Veteran more correspondent Chris Hens is recently wrote an essay decrying the censorship that has kept images of the true phase of wars Distrust not of American living rooms if we saw the deep psychological scars of slaughter the way it Mains and stuns those who participate in war for the rest of their lives. We would keep our children away Supporting the troops also apparently does not apply to the media that have glossed over or ignored the lies in bribery that laid the groundwork for this invasion How absurd that the mother of a killed soldier was heard to say on the radio that her boy died to protect Salt Lake City where she lived What did he die for? Put project for a new American century in your search engine The late 90s think take membership reads like the Iraqi war chicken-ock roster wolfowitz pearl cheney Abrams jib bush and more It's a simple doctor they crafted in large US power and resource control by expanding the military choosing a conflict that were resolved in a quick win and an impressive Show of force to the rest of the world a rack was singled out by them as they preferred country and then continue And when they'd other countries with Egypt and Saudi Arabia mentioned in order to gain control of the media specifically Did we really think the world's most incredible military machine would not inevitably attract the type of an Ickle people that throughout human history have always been attracted to positions of enormous power Do we think that these people even though they exhibit the same disrespect for truth the same propensity for self-aggrandizement the same Contemporary democracy and freedom as petty power grammars to the ages are somehow more trustworthy because they are Americans Here's a quote from one of the most powerful people in the world today Richard Pearl close advice you to bush Who's also known and washing and is the prince of darkness if we let our vision of the world go forth and we embrace it entirely And we don't try to piece together clever diplomacy But just wage total war our children will sing great songs about us years from now Chillie now chilling Got some mushroom cocktail chilling in a refrigerator.

Or he's going back there, or something to look forward to, right, that's another reason to be in South Florida. I like her said it to be out of South Florida. Speaking of schmucks, American idle, hoat punched in a bar bra, claimed witnesses to fight over Jackman Smith's daughter. Ryan's secret is trades verbal jams with Simon Kalman, American idle, but he traded real punches with another actor in Hollywood, bar fight over Jackman Smith's daughter reports the, uh, what is this in? Muts is in the National Enquirer, so it's a good chance it might be true. And I would have said that she pressed 28 is not exactly the second coming of my Hamid Ali. She pressed got popped in the nose, he fights like a scissor, he tried to poke and smack the guy like a girl said to witness, and he liked that. The fight broke out and it exclusive the up here, of the white lotus club on Friday night, March 20, after Ryan put a move on Spencer Margaret Richmond, the 17-year-old daughter, former 17-year-old daughter, a former Charlie's angel, Jackman Smith, and a Rex husband, Anthony Richmond. When Ryan approached her, she was talking with the Rex Boyfriend, Brandon Davis 22, but Ryan really started turning on the charm of sources to club the slows. Brandon didn't know what to do it for. If you thought it was pretty rude the way Ryan and his pals just sort of banged and barged in on them, but then he thought maybe Spencer might be attracted to Ryan. So we decided to make himself scarce and if he didn't excuse to live, Spencer said why did you come back in five minutes and we'll dance? As far as Brandon was concerned, that was Spencer's way of telling she didn't want to get stuck with Ryan, if it turned out she didn't like him, and to come back and rescue her. So about five minutes, Brandon returned, that's when all hell broke loose. Scrawley Ryan started putting on this tough guy and for the Spencer we told Brandon, look buddy you're not wanted here. Why do you just buzz off? Brandon replied I think you're the one who's not wanted around. Here is the scuffle broke out. Ryan's buddy suddenly leaked upon a cool cock Brandon. Yeah. I know. Although Ryan's representative claims that he was in a bathroom and time unconscious on the floor and a full of his own blood. And Brandon came to only Spencer was around Ryan and his buddies and high tailed it all. What else come back? What a wimp. What a little pussy. Lizabeth the smarts are very marginal looking Brian Mitchell's come back. Old woodsy the all guy. It Lizabeth's mark beg me to take her. Those are the chilling words. A lot of chilling going on, you know. Kidnapper, Brian Mitchell plans to use this defense for abducting Elizabeth's Mark from our Salt Lake City bedroom nearly a year ago and the inquire has learned exclusively that the bizarre street preacher plans to call the pretty teen to testify on his behalf and says a present evidence that she ran away with him and was not kidnapped. Brian didn't leave Lizabeth out of her house against her will. His father's shirled Mitchell were recently visited his son in jail told the inquire. Her father alienated her and she turned to Brian. Brian truly believes he did nothing wrong that he was trying to save Elizabeth. Brian can be very, very persuasive. Mitchell in his wife Wanda Barzee are both being held at the Salt Lake City County jail on $10,000 bail charged with aggravated sexual assault, everybody kidnapped aggravated burglarine connection with the abduction and they still are North of body and that fetus are really what's in him. Lacey Peterson and a little bit. Don't look good at that. If convicted Mitchell faces up to Latin prison, but he hopes his detailed defense strategy uncovered by the incredible slashes jail time. He plans to tell the jury that Lizabeth beg me to take her away from her family last June 5 and he's going to make the outrageous fan that she willing their participated in her own kidnapping, a source post to the investigation revealed to be inquirer. Now let's see you ask me about the knife. Mitchell's going to claim that the knife he had was only used to cut a window screen at the house and he never threatened Lizabeth's life and already member of her family. And also Mitchell plans to call the stand, Sandy Utah police officer to arrest it in in Wanda March 12th, this 20 miles from the smarts home. Elizabeth first told Sandy police that her name was Augustine and said that Mitchell and Wanda were her parents. Gradually told Sandy police that she was Lizabeth's smart and did not tell them she was been kidnapped after being held against her will. In fact, she told police, you guys think on the Elizabeth's smart girl who ran away out ran away. I like that, huh? You buy it? Nope. No. Just putting it out there for your proposal. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Yes, sir. I just wanted to let you know that I agree with everything you say.

I think they mean oral strikes. I think they mean, when our good friend Laura Schwartz will have that in the room to one hour in the al-Commity Bits hour. We'll have a lot of juice stuff for it. There's a piece of sauce. I don't think, I don't know. Nobody really did tell me what I'd mock to fry stuff and the first guy. I don't know, but that sounds so bad. Nobody said crap. They don't? Did Jesus eat that if it's satire with the last supper? Yeah. There's a matter of fact. That's what he has to over. He's the unlovered. Oh, gee, I'll pass on that is what he keeps saying. Moken data like that to the mottable soup. 5, 6, 7, oh, let me do this to article. Okay, because we don't have hardly any coal on there. Which is okay. That's all right. Don't bother me. We actually had some pretty good people today. A few ladies. Yeah. Including some real ones. But this anyway, I made mention of it. But ballots can keep bullets from flying. A call to register for peace on Tompain.com and since. Any responsible war of choice, lunch by an arrogant administration with shifting justifications and heatless of world opinion, has sparked a new wave of activism in the US. All right. See, this is flying in a face of all those pool numbers. They keep giving us the one interesting pool to me is the moment where if the election were tomorrow and they don't even aim any candidate, Bush would only get 51%. Uh-huh. Doesn't sound like the 73% approval rating they keep saying the answer. 51% the rest of us say, ah, not so quick. Anyways, as millions of Americans have been distressed in Sliceball to protest your Bush's push for a pre-active war against Iraq, but Mr. Bush wouldn't listen. He dismissed protesters in their concerns. Well, he listened any better if everyone's who attended a March pledge to vote in 2004. Or if in addition, everyone who carried a sign made a speech in an email wrote a letter or a letter candle for peace committed to register one new American voter every month between now in the next presidential election. But he get the message of a groundswell of new peace voters went to the polls in 2004 and showed how regime change can happen peacefully. Do the math. Let's say that two million Americans participated in some way in protests against the war. There's no way of knowing what we think this is a conservative estimate. Say each of them commits to registering one new voter every month between now and election day 2004, that would yield 36 million new voters registered for peace. Some 56 million Americans are eligible to vote, but are unregistered according to U.S. Census. Of course, that would be unprecedented, but a register for peace drive would be hugely significant if it's not up even three million new voters. More important still would be a massive get out the vote effort aimed at all peace-minded citizens, newly registered or otherwise. The same activist doing a registration might commit to phoning each of 10 or 20 peace voters once per month and then weekly in the month before election day. A go-TV effort like that could increase turnout by millions in November 2004, this would be one peace demonstration the president could not ignore. Peace means more than just anti-war at some arises in award the concept of economic and environmental justice, civil rights, equality, democracy and compassion. With that understanding in mind, peace organizers can broaden the call for a massive registration and go-TV effort. The ACLU will soon announce that its membership has grown 33% since 9-11, a sign that the public perceives the administration's home-line security policies as a threat to civil liberties. Likewise, the more the public comprehends the anti-invirtual aid agenda pushed by the White House and its friends in Congress, the less they like. See our club membership has us up 15% as Mr. Bush came to Washington and polls show shrinking support for the Bush economic program as Americans grasp the profound implication of the president's Robin Hood and reverse tax policies. Clearly, preemptive war and new-delanable foreign policy are just two issues that American minds and register for peace movement by benefit from these new public concerns. It might also find support among Americans suffering from lack of health insurance and among seniors unable to afford their prescription drugs. Everyone loves a winner in the uprising route in Iraq by our best in the world US soldiers chaired on by TV news as produced as spike in American public support for military action in Iraq. It also proves how overblown the Iraqi threat was to begin with. The White House obviously hopes to sustain it by shaking the world they saw it at new targets like Syria and by crying we told you so while pointing to the discovery of very chemical or biological weapons labs. Those opposed to the eventualism in Iraq and elsewhere must not heed the Trump and certitude of hawks they must answer with determination to make change. The Centers, the Spirits, Design Patriotic by some hawks undoubtedly, caused President Bush to think twice before launching his preemptive war despite his fainting difference. Demonstrators need the defended side and or excuse his illegal weapons. They did however seekaway to disarm the dictator that would strengthen not weaken the national community and one that would avoid all out war. What's clear now is that the changes they saw and still seek need more than vigils, marches and chance, political leaders who want to wage war may be deterred by everyday people register for peace and promise to vote. Balots can keep bullets from flying. Pretty good on Tompane.com. I'm going to vote. I got my this heavy metal placement voters to registration card after I burned the other one. Yeah. And I'm going to do it. Huh? Good. I'm going to throw it up a letter because I was pissed off about that whole, I don't even know if my vote counted to be honest with you. Didn't you vote for Becannon? Go. I did not vote for Becannon. How do you know? I'm not in Palm Beach. The five minutes to post. Okay Frank, just calm down. Will you please? I think we ought to play the driving movie channel. All right. Have a regular segment. You can do it. What do we say now? Search and destroy. Look at this for the glory. South yet in the midst of official brings in. Goodly, Ben. Did you have a fall? I saw. Oh, filled in Niagara Falls. Real tourist trap. You ever been there? Nope. No. Okay. 560, 560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line QAM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Could you buy any camps for you from positive above what happened in this war? No. Why not? What was that? Well, I don't have to read it. Why don't you tell me what happened. Besides, Sodom is gone. What else? Well, I mean, someone was saying when he was there, the carnage he created was far worse than the long run than what we've done. How do you know that? Well, because freedom is going to come out. Freedom is going to rank. Let me ask you this. How come when he was gassing the Kurds? How come nobody in this country, including Rumsfeld and Reagan, said anything about it? I have no answer for that. But our intelligence. Well, well, but I mean, you have to have any you thought about that. Have you wondered why? Well, sure. I think it was the most ruthless dictator in the world. How come five years ago when the Dick Cheney was sitting on a board of directors at Halibut and they were doing multi-billion dollars business with him if he was so corrupt and broochering his own people? Well, you know, I can say, what you're saying? Well, why is it you want to answer my question? Because I don't have an answer for that. Well, I'll go find out some. Okay. Don't go call here and ask me to try to make something positive about this butcher either we just did. Okay. That turn on any your TV networks. Okay. Turn on Fox and CNN MSNBC in that order and you'll see all this wonderful thing. You'll see MSNBC with a bolt and board there with the pictures of these soldiers. Hopefully, also live, but we know they're not. I don't know if I think positive about this. He called before. Well, you know, I was going to ask all the people over there right now. How positive it is here in assistance. Look at it. Look at the show on TV right now on CBC. But of course, you can't see it. Has been pathetic. Just tragic. Just like an Afghanistan. We bumped into the Stone Age and then we left and Humbercars ISIS all the promises that they made to us didn't keep them. They just got up and hauled ass like they did the last time and all the wardwards have come back and take it over again. Don't don't tell me about how glorious and wonderful the war was until we see something positive happening and by the way, General Jake Garner and his Chalabi guy, Ahmad Chalabi. They don't want any part of these people run in their country. Chalabi has been there for 48 years. Plus, the fact is he's a convicted smuggler. I mean, extorter. Scumbag. Don't confuse these people to fix. Can you say something, pardon, no, I can't. The only thing positive I can say is thank goodness it didn't last any longer. We didn't put you anymore into some people and lose any more young lives of Americans and Brits. That's what I can say. It was needless. There was anybody who died there for any good reason that anybody can tell you. And when it in this business of weapons and mass destruction, where are they? I'm just asking you. That's right. They're all in Syria now. They smuggled them all across the border. Underground and that underground railroad they have. The fact that the witness surprised me if they're over there with Sodom right now. He's probably getting this right to start up again. Syria? I mean, what one day they're telling us about how great they've been on helping us fight terrorism and I know the Syria's are scumbags. But nevertheless, that we just tell them this then months ago and now, now all of a sudden they got this and they got that. I'll say it again. We shouldn't give Israel one penny in a 48 ever again until all of those settlements are cleaned out. That you then you'd see how fast all those people go back where they're held a long and then sit down at the peace table and talk some real sanity instead of this nonsense. Or they keep taunting these lunatics, these suicide bombers and doing nothing. It's like your game of chicken, you know. You come and get us a little back and we'll kill a whole bunch of your people and a sit men and women and children. It's pathetic. But then again when you keep looking at the various reasons that we're into that game, we got these fundamentalist Christians now. The board against oh yes Israel's got to be our ally under any and all circumstances because fill in the blanks. Right. Armageddon, baby. That's right. So they can be the pawns in our nasty sick game eventually.
