Are you ready for Neil now? No. Hey Neil, yeah. How are you buddy? Great. Never better man. Are you serious that it hasn't gotten chilly up there yet? I think about the 65, 68's perfect man. Oh, I love it, there man. Sonny, it's sensational. I love it, there. That place. And don't be picking on my good buddy, Mona. I'm always smoking a big fat one around the building this morning. Yeah, Mo loves to smoke. Big D. He had the big D. He had the big D. He had the big D. He had the big D. So man, I've got so mad that he went out this morning about new tennis shoes. Was he crying again, though? I heard that he had a big D. He was a big cloud. He was in a fog. Clarence is out of town for two days. Another job interview in Duster and it around here, like the like Sid Seasor. Seriously, I'm always sucking up with this now. He's like trying to jump on a bandwagon. He wants in. But it's simple. I mean, on the outside, look it in. Like a little kid is looking in an origin. He wants to be led in. He's pounding on a window. He wants in. It's your station. I just went space. Now that he's out for a cool. I am. Or he will clone. Who are you kidding? I'm John Wayne Gacy. He's my favorite clown. And also the one thing I do want to rip him and ask for and deserve it. So because you told me that he was defending Dave Van Boring. Yeah. Why not? Yesterday we had 80,000 votes and nobody even called it in and mentioned Dave Van Boring. It's suggested he be on the pool. So what does that tell you? He is terminal man. He's awful. You know, the internet had the traveling secretary doing it because Booge had diarrhea for 24 hours. Did he really? Yeah, we have footage. No, listen to this. We got actual footage from his house. You have him having just a 24 hour like screen. Here we go. Listen. That's all right. That's about right there. I think that's Dave Van Boring right there. Now listen to this. We all have an party tonight at Gacy for tomorrow's game. And we're having listen to this. They've never done this before. But we're having a beer bar, a liquor bar, and the Marlin girls. And lucky winner is going to ride around in the Marlin. Billy the boat boat with the Marlin girl. And we're going to try to go some Marlin girl. And then we're going to pay people's faces blue. And I decided I asked Howard if he'd come and we were going to pay me. Think they're blue. Yeah, we're going to spray paint. Oh, man. A lot of paint. Listen, we're going to come up with extra cans. I got a couple extra cans. I got channel 10 coming in. Fox Sports net. And I'll be on the game in a week with Joe Buck this week on Saturday. You can watch me from Toronto to see how pan I am. No, I won't be watching. I won't either. But have a great time. So you got to tell your one thing right now. Here's the challenge. You had 25,000. I'm a Tuesday was pretty lame. 28,000 plus last night. Still pretty weak. You got to get. I'm turning man. Yes. You ain't doing. If I don't get so embarrassing. If I don't get 30. I'm the pierce of the mugs up on a wildcard. They went to night and they couldn't. They're clinch at least a tie. And they can't even get 30,000 in that joint. Either when I give away 20,000 tickets. They suck. The fancier. It's a bit, I told you that. There's no one goes. If I was being a soured pushman, it's a true. Did you push late down? Did you know that we actually put cardboard cutouts of fans in the outfield seats just to make it look like there's people there? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's a pity. We have one of Jim Manage stealing a case of Ironic and from a liquor store. So what did you say about Dave and Boyne? He does have a hot wife. Oh, I heard he has a hot wife. But I was listening to the game last night. When they were, they were up to 6, nothing. I veered off the road. I mean, the guy listen. I don't know him from Adam. I love you. I don't want to care about Dave. I never met him. I hear he's got a much worse hairpiece than even Moe. Like he's smell of dude. It's called a game. It's like God, they're not going to go to a funeral. Yeah. I mean, what kind of a home run call is that? If you're right about living, if you're right about living. You're right about living. Man, he's a dairy. He's been doing for 25 years and he's still socks. Terrible. He's a nice guy. Well, I hate when he comes on the air. The friend's is rolling over. Yeah. Raven. He's poking Rosie Rosewell on the butt and sink. Can you believe this? How about he? Every time he comes on air goes high, friend. Yeah. Lany, freaking for two. Well, he puts right in with a whole ambiance of the pirates anyway. Then, we're going the best... My boat for best. My boat for best. What's castor is that? But then, scullie man. Oh my god. You even... Oh my god. Cooma in do, how could you even say that? Boorin. You're crazy. And the other pipe. Hey, pretty fun. My name is Ely Adels. I know, hitting my perfect game. Bye, guys. I love you. You've allowed your skill. I remember, Luke Snyder. He's more 60. He could look me on the other side. My favorite. my favorite guy is uh is uh Mike Lang the penguins and us. Yeah, I have a good my good buddy Mike Lang. I love him. What is that noise? Yeah, well, for Connoisseurs, the pocket and the leaf style of Amber left the go. All right. No, I got one for you. For you. You would see it. Let me just think I would see it. You start with you listen to me. Yeah, here's mine for you. Listen. Here's a point dating in 13. Oh, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Anyway, I run out anyway. Do you think I'm the one? I'm lucky. I see. I know. I know that. I'm a bull and got two votes. I don't know hockey from crats. I did it in Georgia. You talk about redness. Yeah. They're the worst. They got a nice team. They got to pull these in. It matters. Coville Chuck and he either good. Yeah. No one's going to be making fun of them in the next three years. Coville, chook. Yeah, whatever. Here. He's the fellow who I left off the pole and I bet you don't even know who he is. Who? Jack Quinnlin. I don't remember Jack Quinnlin. Jack Quinnlin, a great cubs announced. I got run over by a car. I got hit and got killed. I remember Jack Brickowski. He knows something that he knows back and we have. Yeah. He was even worse than Vince Kelly. Jack Brickowski was a cornpone. Yeah. There goes another one. Hey. Jack Quinnlin was maybe the best. There comes an answer even better than Harry. He was phenomenal. You know who's in rehab? Who's that? Darren McCarty again. Who cares? People would like to drink booze that want to see people say. Why would we care about Darren McCarty? I'm not giving him in. Nobody cares about talking about him. I can't do any kind of talk about him. He's not talking about him. He's less interested in Sapporo than hockey is harness racing. Oh, my god. I don't know. I wouldn't know. Leave our harness from Elden Harner. I'm God. I lost from Walter Ross. I used to go to the harness racing at the metal lands. When I wanted to clip my nails. Yeah. I used to know his jacket. Oh, man. All I know is first I love horse racing. But harness racing blows. Oh, Jesus. Have a great day. Scott. God. Come on. We're bonded with more. Are we here? Oh yeah. He was done. So I can tell now. When the mortician lifted up my skirt. He said, I live alone alone alone alone. He didn't do that. I didn't tell. I didn't tell. I didn't tell. They're bad. Your favorite Jewish rock and roll in the stars, your man. It's Russia. Shanna and out with their latest hits album. Suck up at the synagogue. My love has back in 2016. It's a baby. I love it. I love it. Yes. Russia. Shanna and I has reformed. I bring you 12 kosher tuss of hop and Hebrew ideas. That girl. It's a good for you. This album should be in every or the doctor's collection. Rolling stone gives it five stars of David. It all will never, never, never. Who wrote the book of Joan. Suck up at the synagogue. You from Russia, Shanna and out. I'm a great singer. I love you. With the synagogue. You from Russia, Shanna and out. I'm able to have all record stores. We'll talk twice when you get here. Still pass over this album. There he is. I'm a fan of this. Ten away to five sixty W.M. happy Thursday to it. We're bonding with Mo. I never thought it could possibly happen. Could it not leave you? You are anyway. George everyday. George has got another story about he and Mo were like taking a cramp together on the same bowl in a list. He was washing and I was washing it. We were chatting. I was chatting. Mo was smoking a big fat one this morning. It was a small thing that he was trying to get into. He got into smoke. He was smoking and he was like, you're such a pussy man. It's just it's embarrassing. It's just it's awful. A little freaking girl to cries all over to all over the place. That's wrong with it. This non smoking thing. If you can't smoke a big fat one while you're working, what kind of a world is it? Anyway. I didn't ask. Hey, Mark, but you shouldn't have to ask. ask. Hey, Malt, but you shouldn't have to ask. I think it's part of the bonding if you really serious about this about many of his fences and making up for you trying to get your ass fired and screw in my show. I think the leasing do is give you a big fat one. No question. Anyway, I got a flash from Bill. I'm not sure if this is the bill that hates you or a different bill. But anyway, it says, no, it's not because it says George. This morning, 624 AM, Howard was rambling about yesterday's sports cancer pool, which means he must be listed. How you doing? All my good close personal friend. I'm listening and saying how Neil began to actually say something nice about him blah, blah, blah. Anyway, he says his cleanest can be Neil. It's me. Mo. Absolutely. I don't really know what that means, but so in other words, I'm supposed to be saying nasty things about him because it's Mo. Is that it? I guess. Well, that's amazing. I think there's a possibility that maybe we'll be here from the audience or whether the thing is a chance for a grandfather and child reunion. Since he is all enough to be my grandpa, I should play that on my own granddad just to piss everybody off. Let me know when. Okay, significantly. I'll go take a look at how that will come out. Now, let's see. Fairbits sportscaster all time. And this to me, I was saying before to show you know, you don't really care about it. But it really is like a, it's a microcosm of part of what's wrong with South Florida lack of cultural interest. I mean, sports obviously to a lot of us isn't that important. It's relatively important. Some of us like it. Some of us hate it. But it's just an example of the narrowness of South Florida. All they know is freebies and early bird dinners. That's all they know. Nothing else. And the company's to come in is to, you know, that crap. That's that's all it is. That's why it's such a, it's a social cesspool man. It's a cultural septic tank. That's the problem. Do a pull on a great sportscaster of all time. And like, you know, they're really great. And I'm not saying that, you know, man dog one hands down and they love him. That's fine. Who's your favorite sportscaster of all time? I'm not necessarily the best who's your favorite. Right. Jim, man, it's 2016. Right. Nobody even close. I hate sports 160 12.9% this is out of 1232 Howard Cousel, 122. And then it's way down. I'll actually surprise in the drop off. What me? Yeah. Oh, no, I would have thought it would have been this one or that one. Yeah. Like you know, Harry, Carrie. Yeah, no, Harry, Carrie, but I don't know who's the favorite among these people. Well, Harry, Carrie's only got 62. That really was my asshole. John Madden 49, Mel Allen 43. I mean, see, right there, because to sure, John Madden only because he's been on the, you know, football games for like 100 years now. I like Madden. They'll be wrong. I think he's a hoot. He's fun. But I mean, to put him, I had a Mel Allen. And again, it's an age thing because we just don't have as many old farts. A lot of them did the terrible thing they went and died. But Gaudy 41, Al Michael's 40. Now, that's pretty interesting. He probably won't be too happy about that. Because his good close personal buddy, Al Michael's only got 40. Hank thinks Al Michael's is the cat's meal. I think he's like a lot of those people. He's like Dick and Berg over exposed man. He targeted Al Michael's. You know what I mean? I'm not already. I mean, he's better than Dick and Berg. But if he just too much, too much of a good thing is too much. Keep Jackson 37 one on your late. We apologize to Scott. He's very upset that his good buddy, Harry Callos did make it on. It's a good thing even in gun Ovoz. He sucks. Bob Prince 32, the great Bob Prince certainly the best baseball broadcaster in his be by far. Rick weaver 31, Mr. Weaver. We miss him badly and those white hankies. Vince gully 29. Can you believe for else, as Vince gully is the best of all time. Man, Scott, and any places on tape and a hockey with a trash should thing there. Do you notice how Scott is a little bit full of himself? Would he like an exaggeration? No. He's full of it. We love Scott for Ralph, but he's full himself. More Howard David at 28 right on Vince gully's ass. Did not not a bad job, Mo. My good post personal buddy, Mo. Red Barber 27. Marv Albert 26. He that'll make most day the fact he's edged out Marv Albert by a pair because he hates him like poison. I better do the break than we can waste some more good time with a results yesterday's pool and we got two polls today. Let's put the first one up Eric because I printed this thing out already. We yesterday we did Ted Kennedy beat out Bush handle it. I got the S.D. on seven at. I'll save these every day. If we had the election for president today and these were the choices who would you vote for. General Wesley Clark, George W. Bush or I wouldn't vote. Let's get that up there right away said it would come back there after the break. It's up there we got votes on it and they're like a hoppin on it. Because later on we got what I think is kind of a fun pool. We've done similar one before, but not quite exactly the same. What's your biggest gross out? I think I was inspired by the conversation with yesterday about people with right here. I shouldn't have that feeling, but it's just you can't help it. You know, it's like what's like. You can't control that. These things happen. If we had the election for president today, these were the choices who you vote for. General Wesley Clark, George W. Bush or I wouldn't vote. That's it. Hop on it. 1013 at QAM, a tensed audio mortgage shopper's out there. The following message could save you or Schmidt load a cash. 10's of thousands of dollars.

She likes to flash her panty. When she don't have those on you. She's hanging like the strongly on right bank office transit stop. Incultors transit snatch. Imagine what you can catch from an older snatch. Not a V.A.P.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R.R and call to transit snatch. Music on the voice, you're... making out her voice there. Walking with the bill, though, firmly guaranteed if her butt in call to transit snatch. And call to transit snatch. Rectom. Go on and go what it could hatch. Call us snatch. Well, I think the audience, you know that mufflands, he has very concerned about anch abductors. Whatever that is. 1019, 40 votes. It does not drop in there. Turn on your eleven fifty. I'm going to want to hear about it. If you are the selection for President today, do you vote for it? General Wesley Clark, about the first forty votes has got 27, 67.1%. Ted Kennedy on the other hand had a tougher battle on his hand wasn't close. Ted Kennedy had 52.3% George's W23.2 and 24.4% said it wouldn't vote yesterday. But today so far, General Wesley Clark is like often running baby. Anybody getting back to the poor result or should we take that call on six and see which quantity it is to think? Whatever. Just pepper pines on the famous line six. Hello. Hello. Hola. Hello. Can't hear or maybe the pod isn't even open. Scott is that possible? Because I can barely hear this call. It's open. Are you hearing him? Sure. I can't hear him. Well you've got to say anything right now. No, he is saying something. He's like a hundred thousand miles away. Like he's on your reign as I don't know. Well let me just see something here. Let's see how low that is. What are you doing with me? Why are you doing to me? Jesus, God Almighty, this Scott's union. I think it's sabotage. I was working. I think Ferrell was working. Everything. And in my right wasn't he sounded like he was about a million miles away? No. No. You could hear when he was saying, sure. Well I couldn't. So you got something picked up there again, Mr. Hot Shot. Mr. Scott Junior, Mr. I want to get paid. Even though I haven't got a freaking clue what I'm doing here. I couldn't hear him. And there's nothing wrong on his end. Believe you me when I tell you. Let's get an experimental call here. Come on. Somebody call in. So we can see what Scott's got screwed up today. 567.0560. Before I get rid of the rest of this poll here. Pound 560 on the AT&T line. Get somebody on the horn. Just for an experimental call to see what kind of technical disaster we have hatched here today. You go on six. WQAM. See, I can't hear him. I can't hear him. I can't hear him. Not saying anything. QAM. Ola. WQAM. Hello. Dany Beach. What is it? Dany Beach. Dany Beach. Yeah, but it's so that the level is so freaking low on here. What are you doing? What is going on here today? I guess something seriously. Any coinc...the...any similarity between our radio station and QAM is purely coincidental. See, Mo is finally cut on. I told you this before the showday. He's finally...droped his big heart on for us and he realizes that the problem there is management and the engineering and sales. All not necessarily met order. That's the problem. The establishment of QAM. Not us. We're not the enemy. They're the impediment to our success. It's got to be one of the great miracles in the history of mankind at this station as well as it does. I mean, let me just try a couple more, okay? And believe me, there's nothing on this in any different from what it always is. WQAM. QAM? See, they're dickin' with you on purpose now. WQAM. WQAM. Hello. Ditto. Yes sir. You hear me Ditto. Yeah, but it's not sound good. Not sound good. Ditto. Yes. Who's that? Can't hear you. I heard him. Real mess. Just in the sense, this isn't the usual, I mean, sounds like they're right next door all the time. Maybe there's something over here. I'm not your part and sounds fine here. Well, it doesn't sound fine up here. How do you like that, Mr. Hotchat? That's it. It almost affects how he's like covered up for Scott's ineptitude. Oh no, if he was in my fault. We'll find a way. We threw something all up. Ripping for it, but it's not him. This is what I first call. You're telling me you could hear the first call in the last six. Well, I couldn't hear him at all. Okay. So there was something dicked up on you right? Because I haven't changed anything. There's nothing to change. I have no control over that. See, understand? I've no control over that, Mr. Hotchat. I'm no control. This is always a good one. WKOM line nine. Can you hear me, Neil? Just barely. He's doing that on purpose. I'm not here. But we want him in low voice. You know who that is. WKOM, hello. Just barely. Yeah, just a little bit. That's our threat. Oh, that's our threat. Oh, oh, oh, oh. By the way, we got a vanhead today. This should be real successful. Miguel says I had several calls this week for the van to go down to this area. Well, I've our best in Neil merchandise to see these. I got my own low Howard David keychain. And you can get yours too. 11 AM to 1 PM that I had dream cars south. 174.03 South, 60 Highway down to South Day. And you can get all your good crap there. Got the mad dog keychain. They wildly popular Jim Mandage. From a Howard David keychain's less than wildly popular. But bonding with us desperately. Right. Maybe mobile CDN. And then we got the CDs of course. The 2002 2003 best of which have a lot of good crap on by the way. Got time again. I have no total. I have no number on there. And I realize it like everything else. It's just kind of like stuff shot. You know, we paste it all together. Maybe Miguel will give us a number. Maybe the guy will give it to him. Maybe he won't. And the idea. I'll do the best we can. It's all. No point in getting all better to shape about it. Because all we can do is the best we can. There you go. Under Make Believe circumstances. And I looked on a QA. Now let me just do it again here. Okay. I don't want to rip them and ask unless they deserve it. Especially since my close personal friend Josh Cortis has involved. Who happens to look almost human. It's a point. Look and now I don't think he's even here yet today. No. This was supposed to be supposed to happen today. I thought this was going to happen yesterday. It was a working progress yesterday. You told me that we're going to write a link. Working progress yesterday. I couldn't find him. But now that everybody got emailed this morning. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Ha ha. We don't want to make things happen too fast. I mean, it's such a big project to put another link on there to our fundraiser. Oh, please. It's just it's just pathetic. It is just for that. I'm going to leave down on a floor. Let me know when you guys are ready to run our radio station. Just just shout. Just give me a holler. Bring the phone or something. God. That's just unbelievable. It's a work in progress. How many weeks is it going to take to get that on there? Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the info. WQM phone line check. Yes, guys. That sounds pretty good. I don't want to talk to him though. I don't think he wants to. I'm easy. I don't know if I say. That sounded good though, didn't it? Yeah. Well, there you go. Well, I'll try to tell me that sounded just like the first one. It's not just like the first one. To you it did, but not to me. That's the point. I think it sabotaged. And by the way, did see gas like a couple of times. 26 after 10 at 5, 60 WQM. Here's a place that won't drive you nuts. Brandy shoes.

Stop in or check them out on the web at Brandy's shoes. 5 at local, 6 is 560. 3 years old yours. PUEAN. That's no white association. Let's face. Most of us will never be rich. Hell, we probably won't even be successful. And that's pretty damn depressing. But as usual with every problem, there is a solution. Hi, I'm Jim and I'm going to tell you a little something about handguns. They scare their shit out of people and intimidate them and give you whatever you want. That's right, handguns. Think about it. Need some cash? Rob a bank. Don't have enough money for beer? Or the convenience store. Take some chips and pretzels wire at it. It's all free if you've got a handgun. Some son of a bitch, cheating on your girlfriend? Kill him. It's a simple solution, a life complex problem. Why have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the court. Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares? By the damn thing of the street. Just buy a lot of handguns. It's a great alternative to working problems out and it can be considered a population control. Yes, handguns. They just might make your fans. Yes, we continue right in those agonchos spots here on QM. I want to apologize and behave with those of us with a conscience because it's embarrassing and humiliating. And we're a bunch of great robbers and I admit it. One student did a Minnesota shooting by the way. You're going to be good timing to bring this in? Just a coincidence. A freshman opened fire at a high school yesterday, killing one student who was going to be a second before a teacher apparently talked about and dropping the gun authority. And you want to know why? Why? You want to know why? People in America continue all ages, young and old, and everything. I'll tell you why. That's the American fucking way. That's right. Everybody's got to have a whole bunch of guns to make them feel more masculine because the America's got to be already complex deep seated. That is deep seated as the Canadian one. But they got a big deep seated. So they got to have like a big piece. The suspect was taken into custody at the late morning shooting at Recory High School in Cold Spring, a small town about 60 miles northwest of the 20 cities Minneapolis Saint Paul. Police said the 14 year old boy was not identified as cooperating with authorities. The motor for the shootings now yet. Maybe he was just pissed off. No, probably. Police, he filled down said there was chaos as police arrived at the school. One of the students were shot while in the weight room and the other shooting occurred in the gym. Aaron Wallen's a senior guy that the hospital after being shot on the face of Nick. Seth Bartel, a freshman is in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and head. See, let me say it again. The fact that America accepts this as though this is like I've told you before the way that life is supposed to be. It just is not. See, this is not the way life is supposed to be. A bunch of lunatics solving their problems by blowing people away. Everybody running around with a goddamn bunch of guns. They're probably the real world of supposed to operate Virginia. But it does. Or Minnesota. Or any other goddamn state. How's that pull coming by the way? What's his name? Wesley Clark. See, I'm all for him. Only because he's not W. Bush. That's why. Yeah. 113 votes. I don't think we're going to anywhere near the 258 we had yesterday. We had a gigantic turnout in the Ted Kennedy Bush abaddle, although a Bush had a lot more votes. Then he's going to get today. 113 in general, Wesley Clark 76 67.2%. Do a 15 points better than Teddi did yesterday. I wouldn't vote 19 and G. W. Bush 18 of the first 113 vote. And let me say this Bush rating lowest ever. This is some good news. There's one. We'll get to that. We'll get to a bunch of stuff. Okay. Okay. There's a lady on a phone. I can see this will be the ultimate test. Because if it's a real lady, it'll be like a real call. Do you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. She won't be playing games with our emotion we take. Who's a lady and keep us game? Hello. Hi there. Yes, ma'am. I hear loud and clear. I'm a real lady. Okay. Just so you know that. Me too. Listen. Yeah. I'm glad I got you. I'm leading tonight for Amsterdam. Amsterdam. And I want to tell you that I don't know where to eat. We have a nice hotel. I think the sheriff's pollitzer. And that I would like some recommendations for us to where we should die. McDonald's. Any ideas? McDonald's. McDonald's. The food and Amsterdam is from hunger. It's awful. It's terrible. I hear that. Why is so bad? I don't know because their taste is in their touch. I guess I'm the busy side doing a lot of drugs in the screw and a lot. I don't know their food. I don't need, huh? Let me tell you this. The best bet. I know it sounds corny, but the best bet. They have like these, um, your steak eater? Yeah. Well, the best bet are like they have changed. These are little steakhouse, tains, uh, Argentinian steak. I forgot what the names of them are. But that's your safest bet. It's generally pretty good. And the, you know, the animals have been dead for only a few years. You mean I have to leave here and go there and find Argentinian food when I am here? Let me, let me see. Let me see. Nobody goes to Amsterdam to eat, okay? Okay. That's it. Keep that in mind. So get some of those pomas free. Does those big 45 pound the containers are fries and just water them out and have a great time. Are you flying on Martin here? Yeah. Is that how you got there? No, I'm not anymore. Now, because I fly from Toronto now, I go on KLM. I go looking at a real airline. No Martin there is fine. You know, you'll be a little bit cramped up and you won't be able to come up and you'll get a fly. Can't go up and you'll get a fly. Let's see. We're flying star class. Star class. What you'll be amazed at how a marginal land is. But at least the price is good, right? Yeah, I'll say. Yeah, that's the way to go. That's why we used to fly star class because the prices right. But again, it's like being a star dean. You'll do a love. Don't need to food on a plane either by the way unless you like to see bass or the wolf trout. Really? Have a great time. Have a great time. And to do a good time for a diet, trust me. Should I go to the red light district? If you're going to go to Amsterdam and not check out the red light district, why would you even leave the house? Okay, I'll report when I get back. Have a good time, also, believe me. Awesome, please. Right. Do we? She's going to Amsterdam. Well, that's good, everybody's not going in. Safe to go back. I told you earlier when you were there. Soft and it did. Well, I told you we had a lot of other reports. It went through a lot there. There were no tourists there, which means there was only Dutch people. And believe me when I tell you, don't want to go there when there's only Dutch people. Because generally speaking, there's people suck. And it's only been feel good. Now that Dutch people are not good. Generally speaking, they're pretty, you're miserable. They're one step away from the crowds. I see the young German people on the other hand are fine. The Germany's great. I know I should probably shouldn't say that. But Germany is wonderful. I'll deliver. You'll love the lever. And what a German sausage. The lever worst. It is the worst. Anyway, getting back to our pull result. Look at this. It's 1037 already. Haven't even come close to finishing the pull. Well, I'm just proud with a pull because it, like I said, it starts to show you. It's like putting the spotlight on what a vacuum self-floor it is. People are just, I mean, what do they know about it? But ask this question for many years. I've heard, man. I don't have a gun any ID besides pre-bees and early bird dinners. Like that thing we had the other day where Miguel was at the Brown County Convention Center. We raised 20 bucks for abandoned pet rescue. One CD he peddled because everybody else was lined up to spin the wheel for their free Marlon tickets. And they still only get 25,000 and 28,000 for the two most important games of the season last two nights. Was there any, was there a cloud in the sky? Was there any kind of a weather impediment? No. I already checked. I talked to my sources. Very, very humiliating, degrading and embarrassing. You just can't, you can't get a rise out of that goddamn town, especially this time of year. See, this is, this is like I said, shining the enormous gigantic spotlight from the sky. I'm what a vacuum exist there now. What is anybody ever coming back? Oh, don't think so. Jesus, God, like everybody bailed out like it was like a bubonic plague scare or something. And they just stayed there. I thought we'd want to get the audience all panicking. But that's what it seems like. Anyway, Marlon Albert at 26, so we'll be tomorrow by two. Nice going, Mo. Our good close personal buddy, Mo. Who was smoking a big fat one in the building this morning in the bonded with George lately? He's sucking up to us. I think he's going to a change of life for something. They can, got religion. Like he's like new year. Did I always try the one who always said there was like a soft spot in him somewhere? You said that. I think it's an effect. I think it's an effect. Only Harwell 22, Pat Summer all 21, the Scoota Phil Rosito 18. Offer, just one of the worst. Bill's in for 16. Myron, coped 13. Johnny Mouse 13, book, Chami 13. That's kind of a strange trifecta. Johnny Hershey 11, Mike Lang 11. Gene Deckerhoff, voice of FSU, Eddie, a 10-babe buckiners. I think. Any still doing a buckiners? Yes. Craig Cusick, Lindsay Nelson and Hank Goldberg, all those that each had ten. Gary Thorn had nine to kidberg nine. Jack Buck eight, Van Miller eight. See, this is what's gets silly when somebody's people are getting so few who really deserve to be way up their chicken at only eight. Mark Vandermir 7, Gene Hart 7, voice that a flyer's. Not a taste a tasty cake. You ever have any tasty cake? No, that's why he's dead too much. Then tell his six also dead. dizzy Dean five he's dead. Rick's generate is alive lost a lot of weight by the way. Listen good Rick he's great. Rick generates only get four votes. See how can there be a hockey team itself for it? Seriously. The says number eight glory and number nine. Oh, Anderson. Oh, man and glory. They've made a change on that play. Thanks Bill. And anyway, they don't know anything about hockey. That's why Rick you're at it. You're right. So we got four votes. Morty Glickwood's got four. Dick by Tallahore Dave Halberstam our close great personal friends got four. Dojo Dodgey Olos got four. Winnelly a three. Marty Brennan three foster hewetry Joe Bowlin three Chuck Thompson three. Skip Kerry and Bill hewety. He's have only two, which is an investment right Bill. What else? Chris Shankle end of which we spelled wrong. We apologize only one. Wait, wait. Rosie Rose Welch and Gordon George Kelly. One and no votes for Tom Redderman John Davidson Tim Riders. Jim Woods out of 1232. Oh man, how can there be sports teams in South Florida? So it used to be just the dolphins and you know what? What? That's what it should be now. There is absolutely no way that that area that that community will ever be able to seriously support. I'm talking about it in a meaningful way. I'm not just talking about have a bogus number of tickets that they supposedly sold for an NHL or NBA game and then have a bunch of people milling around in the hall because they would have no interest in what's going on and they didn't pay for the tickets in the first place. That's not a sports time. That's not support. See, that's just a phony baloney. And just like now, even these people at our show and our pretty marons, probably half of them are just for running phony jumping on a van wagon. Am I right Scott? You're right. I am right. Always. No, I'm not always right. In fact, sitting down here this morning was one of the worst mistakes I've ever made my life. 1041 at 560 WQM. Look at away General Wesley Clark has got 71 percent.

And now it's time for another edition of the unpublished works of Dr. Suz. Today's selection. Horton hears a hoe. Horton hears a hoe. Calling to him. Have you got money to blow? Why yes. Horton said quickly sporting a poll. There's 100 in my pocket and it's burning a hole. I'll take off my clothes if you give me your cash. And Horton got excited as she exposed her bare essential. Then Horton did mouther. And boy was he glad. When she screamed, you're the biggest Horton I've ever had. When Horton was done, he smiled and set for a smoke. But the hose started laughing. Horton said, what's the joke? Then the hoe turned around. And Horton looked and got sick. Because this hoe, like Horton had a big hairy chest. That was another selection from the unpublished works of Dr. Suz. See it can horton's by the way. It's a 1047 at 560WQM. Here's a great fact. I love this one. I'm going to the coin. I will watch her die eat. Oh, that's called. Why did I humor her? You know, because it was a woman. Right. Who'd have been a guy at a rip them and asked. I thought I am a softie for any female voice. I don't know why. Yeah. And then this fact from this chronic fracture. I almost thought this. Huh? I know that guy. I thought this was a rich packer with his handwriting. But maybe it's not. I think it is. Maybe he's in the star mood today. But it says it's Marty not Morty Glickman. You idiot. When you're the idiot because it's a joke. That's the way he used to pronounce it. But at heavy a northeastern accent. Don't you understand? Marty and Morty Morty Glickman. You don't get it. You're more on your idiot. You're a typical software ambassador. Okay? Who every now and then wakes up on a wrong side of bed. Facts is every guy that day by how many times did they? Fuck. And then every once in a while gets a bug up. Is that what some sarcastic crap like this? Okay? Just to try to, you know, export your hostility up across the border here. Nice job well done. You asshole. You idiot. Am I right, Mo? Come on, Mo. Where in hell are you? I know. Try to get some help. Also we say today, Skoba Zuro's birthday. We didn't want we don't really give her crap. Koby Zuro's sucked. That was enough to turn my ass the other way. In 1963 CBS brought up the New York Yankees. All my life. I was a Yankee fan in a pirate's fan. 63 are set to you guys. They fired. The greatest broadcast trio ever melalan red barber and who else? And Jim Woods. And they brought in three ex-Jocks. Phil Rosuto, Joe Dodgeola and Jerry Coleman. Who couldn't broadcast their way out of a paper sack? And I said, you can take your Yankees and stick them up your ass. And they can they can, you know? 1808 votes. We're not going to come anywhere near the 250 at the end yesterday with Ted Kennedy. But Wesley Clark is doing a much bigger, bigger bashing, even though Kennedy won a handle. Hands down. And then that's considering the fact that Teddy had murdered that plot. I mean, I had that accident with Murray Joe Capectnacy. He's got that little albatross around his neck just a minor thing. 38 votes if the election were being held today. Channel Wesley Clark 131 votes almost 60 almost 70 percent 69.6. George's WD Bush 30. How many has he got? About 30 man. 15.9 percent and I wouldn't vote 27.14.3 percent. So not only would more people vote in that election, but by far, what's he got? Almost 70 percent. He's got 50.2 percent. But Wesley Clark, well of course haven't been a general. He didn't kill anybody. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Nobody that didn't have it coming. Right. He told me to bad guys. He didn't kill any innocent drunken women. Like Murray Joe Capectnacy. Was that Robbie Vincent on the Tallahad? Yeah, same to him. I was getting confused the two of them. Ever see a take him to the Robbie Vincent together. Same guy. We just ate a lot. You know, after that tough adolescence, he just ate a lot. 190 votes in the Wesley Clark continues near 70 percent. staggering. Wesley Clark's demand, baby. I don't want to hear any dialogue, any debates. We don't care what he stands for. Just let's change right now. What do you say? Huh? Let's get ahead start. I think it's a great idea. I'm for it. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. No. Yes sir. Yeah. I'm Neil. Yes. Here you are. I'm my end. There you are. Okay. Quick question. I hope that you can help me with. Yeah. Please explain the difference or the relationship or whatever it is between the Netherlands and Holland. I understand that Amsterdam is in Holland, but I don't understand what's the Netherlands. It's just another. How long is this like a nickname for the Netherlands? Name of the country is the Netherlands. And Holland is a nickname for it. Right. Okay. I don't ask it a lie. I want to part of time. I knew where that came from, but it's it's the same thing. Of course it's a lot easier to say Holland than the Netherlands, right? Yeah. Of course. And I just thought maybe Holland was a, but stake within the Netherlands or the Netherlands. There is a how on the big and my opinion. I want to go there. There's a town in Holland and Michigan called Holland, Michigan. They have a college here. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. There you go. And by the way, when you go to Holland, I'll tell you where you can eat. Did they have a lot of this story? If I'm going to go to Amsterdam, should I go to the red light district? No. I don't know if I go there. I've got to only know what kind of perversion and filth you'll see there. I don't kind of perverts. Still, they have a lot of blue light specials in the red light district. Yeah. I know they have green light specials. Why? Why? Why? Why not Toronto 3 and Detroit Nothing. Of course it's 100 years ago. But like I said, when you're least fanny, have to live in the distant past. Like being a dolphin fan. Now, I think that all the other sports teams I hate to say it. I say it's first of it. And Marlons haven't as big run. They all got to leave. You know, because it's not a sports town. It's never going to be. It's not anything town. It's a stopping off point like handbag crops. It's a most of the name of that movie that Harvey Firestone, Fag movie. Wow. Could you narrow it down? Don't you remember the Harvey Firestone Fag movie with handbag crops? The one where he said that what's going to be loud is that so wrong. If he had a great line in there, she said when we get old, we go to Florida. We all go to Florida to die. Right. And that's right. That's what it is. It's a place for old people to go to die. Not a place for living and breathing people. By any stretch of imagination. And our pull on the sports cast is a tremendous reflection on the lack of just There. And again, I know you're not interested in sports, but like I said, you could substitute almost any other category there. And it would be the same. It's like, huh? Yeah. What are you talking about? We don't know from that. We don't know who these people are. We don't know what do they know? What did they do? All these people who came from someplace else. What did they do? Did they have an early bird in New York in Manhattan? I'm sorry. Manhattan? See, because then they'll be right again. It's not Manhattan, and it's Manhattan. Just like Morty Glickman. See, that was the famous thing about Marty Glickman. It's because it was always Morty Glickman. Commoner races at Yankers before bullet Bob Meyer. These these people, man. It's annoying. I shouldn't get aggravated because it's pity. It made me check. Actually, show it up to me. That's probably my turn to stick off two days. They're probably stonewalling on a chicken. Oh, yeah. We got to check it. There's somewhere near the water named downstairs. Thought you were still here. That was the the last time. Yeah. Who are you people, kid, man? Who are they kidding, huh? What kind of an outfit is that? They have to hang onto your check for a couple extra days just to make sure it doesn't clear right away. Because they're trying to rob from Peter to PayPal. So they can pay the broadcast. Rice roll has got them ball games. So great week can be a jack and run around. Oh, look at me. I'm Mr. Sports. I'm Mr. Sports. Sports? Yeah. Mr. Schmendrick is what we call it. In fact, that's probably about the best we call him. Don't forget just moments from now to best in the American dice. And we're going to go for a big day today. For what about 50 bucks? Sure, at least. Well, I know that's he can't do 50 because we don't have anything for $10. It's going to be like an even number. Maybe something about 80 bucks today. Looking for it. Dree and of course you know what my gals is. Nobody wants my CDs this year. Nobody wants your crap. Neil, let's what he said the other day after George pulled him out of Doreen. Well, like a boxing match. I had to get the referee under Sheppard. I got him. Two hundred nineteen votes. No, we'll never make the 250. If we had for our Teddy Kennedy. All the Wesley Clark is winning by a much bigger margin. 153 69.8% then there's 70. George's W. Bush 35. 15.9% I want to have yesterday Bush. Like I remember. I got to hear some or just relax. I got to hear some or just I think. Let's see. Howard Cousel George Bush. I don't know what that I did with it. I got too many poles running around here. I mean, we're totally about that. You have too many poles. You know, we're going to grab next. Let's see. Here's a message about some stupid S website. Here's that hot quarterback from Notre Dame. Oh, man. I don't see what that I did with the Ted Kennedy pool. How can I have done that? There's the one with JFK and Abe Lincoln. Maybe I put it up here. Here it is. I put it up there. Two fifty eight. Let's see. A Bush had 23.2% against the Kennedy. He's got a 15.9% against Wesley Clark. I think it's safe to save it. We got a few minutes left for them to vote. That Wesley Clark much stronger candidate because as a general, he didn't kill anybody. I'm sorry. Keep saying that. Right. Why do I keep saying that? I don't know. Just think it's going to make a point. Like case it in Godfather. Okay. I'm Michael Presidents and Senators don't have them and killed. Who's being naive now? Okay. Presidents and Senators don't have them and killed. I'm not an appropriate time to bring it up to you, Lovis. At a time when American kids are dying, every goddamn day for a for no reason for a pack of lies for a bunch of billionaire. See, here's a question I have for you. How much is enough? You know how many times you've talked about this over here's how much do you have to have? How many beers do you have to have at a handful of Paul game? How much money do you have to have Wayne, Hypinga and Bill Gates and audio other grave robbers? How much do you have to have before you finally have enough? Oh, the people are dying. This is for 20 times a week. You way am. Just get off. No. Hey, Lord. Hey, Lord. I stumble in our bumble just to talk is really hard. Without free written notes from power over Andrew Card. Hey, Lord. I'm bringing his way to do do. Hey, Lord. But that doesn't seem to bug you. Has no opposition and you have no up in your team. Let's pose pretty hard. Come out, raise by the shot and wave of white collar cramps. Unless you're of course the CEO is your old friend, you're my big horse. That's just let Oshaman go. And I'm a reflector, he's a homo. The zombies say attack us, but we'll give a crappy scene. Let's discuss a few more of our friends. Next to Sherwood, we're in pursuit of people, Jewish and reday. Just like those drug lord's been pursued by OJ. Game of course. You don't care what I'm doing. The horse. And I thought I was stupid. The media controls up you do what you told the game horse. If you didn't see it on TV and it's real. The media is an arc and troll with stories there is spinning. No matter what goes wrong. It will just blame it all on the team. I don't have no intention going down. I'm on a higher ball of ground. Is that I wouldn't know how. He's a moral grounder and a fountyr team. Let's go to a 560 W2M. So anyway, yesterday Eric being right on top of it. As soon as I started acting like I couldn't find a pull from yesterday, which I couldn't for a minute. So he emailed me. The 1606 was the total number of hosts from yesterday. We're not going to come even close to that today. We got 244. What do you got on yours? 244. Yeah, see. We had 266 yesterday. So we're slipping. We're down 22 votes from yesterday on a presidential pull. That's a bad sign man. Or slipping. 247. Like I said, we got a shot. We leave it up there another minute. So anyway, yesterday the final total. Ted Kennedy 141. I wouldn't vote 64 and George W. 651 on 266. Kennedy wanted his hands pretty good, but not like Wesley Clark, baby. Oh, 147 votes. General Wesley Clark, 174. 70.4%. Oh, the general. Do we have any idea what is opinions on? Oh, this position's on about the deficit about the foreign policy of life in a big city. All these things. Oh, but we like them. And you want to know why? Why? Because he can beat the crap. I can beat the pants off a bush. Who can George. George W. 3815.3% pretty lame. And I wouldn't vote 3514.1%. Out of 247. We better get over 266. I'm going to be in a sour mood even worse than in the beginning of the show when I couldn't get them phone. And you notice we had several people on hold. They're including a lady. Yeah. They don't hang on. I'm looking at one now. You're looking at Lady right now. Who is it? Wow. Does Lady in Miami, huh? Hey, you know. Hi. I don't care who is both funny running against monkey boy, all vote for both funny. Absolutely correct. I've got a poll idea. Good. Same vein. And that is all the media commentators who have been gotten to and gone from being liberal to far right wing. Yeah. And the first one I would name would be your old friend Phil Henry. Who has? Are you sure? He has to come such a hate manga. Yeah. It's unbelievable. A sell-on. A total sell-out. I mean, but he believes that it's not a, I mean, he believes it's all his angry little heart. Yeah. He said the other day that we were going to say they're going to bitter end because we are entitled to our SUVs. And I'm trying to do the land and the rest of it. He was just had to be sarcastic. Oh, you could have passed. Huh? I'm telling you. He believes it. No, I don't think so. I think that knowing him that had to be a tongue-in-cheek. Oh, no. I mean, I listen. I listen. Are you sure? Are you sure? I got a few laughs at him. But now he's, you know, beneath every comment there's this really hateful person. Hmm. He's there. I'll be dead. So anyway. So. How did that illegal alien he married with a 15 kids that probably saw it on life? Oh, be out. But there is wife cheating on him and those aren't his kids. How do you know that? Well, she's out of town a lot. Do you notice that? Yeah. And so I'll make sure you think that she's cheating on him. What would you say that? Well, that's the word. The word from a hole. I'm not going to say. The word down the pipeline. I'm not going to say. The adultery pipeline. Just trust me. It'll come out. Okay. All right. Okay. Have a great day. I guess he's still hanging back. Okay. Oh, whatever you want. And what do we have here today? 2606. We got 267. I'll get it back out there a little bit. I'm not pleased with that at all. Final totals here. We can go. Schmidt can't let Polar. General Wesley Carc 186. 69.6% George W. Bush 43. 16.1%. I wouldn't vote 38.14.2%. How did 267? By the way, that was her opinion about the Phil's wife. I don't know. I'm not comfortable with that kind of crap. You know, people just throw crap out like that. Yeah. Well, so you'll find out it's in the pipeline. It's down. Yeah. And by the way, she didn't ask me where to eat though. Maybe she's cheating with that lady's husband. 560560. Pont560 on the AT&T line. Here's Pol number two. Here's the important part of the show today. That was just. I don't even know if we should do that anymore. Who else could we? We could put him against Julie. I told you this morning. Anyone. I'm not proud. You're not listening to me. Don't just need a big difference. We had almost 70% for Wesley Clark and 10 Kennedy 52. Chris says not running for obvious reason. But I mean, just I thought since Ted's the one that's opening a big mouth and saying things that make our level of sense, I think we'll do Howard Dean tomorrow. Oh, yeah. Don't you? Sure. I'm still Howard Dean, man. I mean, a lot of you've jumped right on the Wesley Clark bandwagon. I'm not really sure why just because it's the popular thing to do at the moment. They look at the uniform. It's the Fed. I'm not sure. But I'm just not all that crazy because within a couple of days he flipped a lot like crazy about the whole Iraq War thing. One day he said, well, he would never have voted for the resolution. And then he said he would have voted for Wesley and then he said, what did I say? What does that? Yeah. What did I say? What do you want me to say? So I'm just he reminds me of Arnold only. We'd like a better uniform. I had to make the big, the big California. California last night. We'll talk about that eventually. And if Arnold thinks he's really a putting his best food forward, way who's waiting in a wings. Martina. Martina may run for US office and you. I guarantee as you can kick to crap out of Arnold. I don't care how much of a bodybuilder he used to be. You know, he's probably in better shape could just with one hand, tiger, underback. Beat the snout of that punk. The terminator, my ass. So anyway, what's your biggest gross out? We're asking today. My list so far. I think I already know what I'm voting for. I feel bad about it. What? Red here. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't control it. It's just like how come I like Nesslie's turtle ice cream. I just do it. It's just by a zippers scene. It does a dance on my taste buds. Okay. You've never seen a redhead you were attracted to. No, really. No. Wow. No, in my life. I've never seen a male female. Now, maybe some famous females with red here. Actually, Julie and more from Magnolia for example. She's got red here. Are you kidding? I love Julie and more. I think she's great. And I'll come up with other ones. I'm sure. But she doesn't have like, like, that you know the kind of redhead on the top. She doesn't have like, carrot top red here. Huh? Sure. She does. I mean, it's not like flaming like neon red, but it's red. Are you sure? Oh, yeah. Was that filled? Not a fact. Are you sure? Are you sure? Pupicares. Anyway, what's your biggest gross out? Well, I'm just saying generally speaking, there's always an exception. Just like sometimes you'll see fat people who are very, very attractive. And you say, got to think only last about 600 pounds they'd be hot. Yeah, they'd take that tragic. It is sad, especially young people. You see, you know, you're wrong. You think it's kind of they just lost like 40 pounds. They'd be beautiful. Right? I might even look for it. Wait, can't look for it now because it's a good fight in the middle of like, Kaja folds, jaws of life. What's your biggest gross out? Red here. Body odor. Oh. I may have to change my vote. Zed. You can do something about the body odor, though. Zed? Jelly rolls of fat. I see. You know how long it's been since I've had a slice of jelly roll? You know how we eat in the wrong way. How do we always come back? How do I not? How do I not? How do I always bring everything back to food? Once the last time you had a slice of ice cream cake roll. You know what I mean? Oh, that's a good question. It's a long time. You know what I'm talking about? I do. It's good. Oh, my God. Why don't you let it melt a little bit so they can taste it? Do they make that like a carfell? I'm sure they do. Because carfell really sucks, but that's one thing I think they had. That's really good. You're like, could he plus? Cookie, push? Yeah. Cookie, push, cookie, push. What is that? Cookie, Puss? Now the Puss was yesterday. No, I heard it out with that. The using Puss from Anne Colter's uh, rectum or whatever. That was that Muff got it was crying about. Oh, what are we going to do? Yeah, Muff, we like you. I'm up here. A good guy. I don't ever make a mistake on it. We like you a lot, but you're such a, such a little girl, man. And crying about Moe was smoking a cigar. I, my hats off the Milam starting like a cotton up him a little bit. And even Georgia starting to like cozy up. Even though we tried this, but he didn't get your ass fired. But you know what? He did the right thing. He can't live the past forever. That'd be funny. Absolutely. He did the right thing. He backed off. And like I said, now he's finally. It's a little after a year and a half. I think they're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking.

They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all smoking. They're all going to stink, and they're all going to stink. What's that? Let's scream. What if I get it too? Yeah. We'll walk the door in Jamil, Wedgett. Crying like a little lady. Oh, man, is he a pussy? Watch your biggest gross out right here. Body odor is it. Jelly rolls of fat. I look bad for the word today. I get such a kick out of myself sometimes. Bad breath. Schloppy clothes. Like me or bad wig. Like mo.

When you see a person That could be somebody you know somebody you don't know whatever just what what the visual thing. Oh, I got what if you're gonna ask me. Okay. Bad nose. Bad nose. Bad nose. Oh, I'm not gonna see, you don't understand the pull again. You're associating a sexual connotation this. It could be that, but that's not what I'm talking about. I've got red hair on here. I have the same thing about noses. If it's an ugly nose, I run screaming from the room. Really? See, then like I said, you understand the pull. Because that's what it means. Yeah, I know what I can get past you. Somebody with a real obnoxious ugly grotesque nose and you just want to start running because like what time did this spaceship plan? Yeah. Like men can have a big nose and it's not necessarily a big deal or a bump on their nose. And it's like, okay, maybe it works. Maybe it doesn't. But if a woman has a big jack dog, no. It's a bunker. Rewons all of it. It just, it taints. I don't know. I'm like Marty Glickman used to announce the races at honkers. 1113, we got 11 for body odor already. Well, it's a good thing they're not here. Because somebody was packies man and some of those Indian people. Very nice people find people to the south of the earth, but too much salt is not an assoly good thing. Especially in your curry.

From now on we'll want to clock at Dream Cars South 17403 South 16 highway with the Abestineel Merchines. And they were waiting for it. And he report you? Yeah, he said why is he talking about me? I've been here for 20 minutes. Did I or did I not mention that a couple of times before? I thought I told him. They said it's inside. Did we have a number from the end of the business yesterday? Did we have a number? I'm much we've raised. Yeah. I see. Maybe that's why I'm not talking about you Miguel because you're useless. Even the renaissance discovered. Okay. He finally took a look at that thing and she said she tried. She danced. She twisted. She looked and nothing happened. Useless. That's what she said. That's what his wife says. Now I think she's using somebody else's. Oh. Texas University shuts down big sale. Well, I asked obviously he hasn't gotten one dime yet done there. Dream Cars South. You remember the old days when he used to say to us, Pick a location and we'll go there. Do you remember that? Yeah. And almost every time it was a success. It was a jackpot. Okay. Yeah. Am I right? Right? I'm not saying every single time. But generally speaking more often than not, it worked out very well. Yesterday he's inside a day in the convention center in a player two days ago where they have to pay to get in. Where nobody's got any idea what those going on there unless they're computer nerds. And out today he said, well, I don't even know anything about Dream Cars South. You? No. I know it's on US one. That's something. It's a card join and look for the QM fan. There Miguel is desperately waiting for and he's calling him bitch in and belly. Like a little child. Maybe he can come back to the station and sit around a cry with duck. Oh, what? Why would they say something good about us? When you start raising some money, group, all maybe they will say something good about you. Texas University shuts down bake sale. SMU, Southern Methodist University, shut down a bake sale yesterday, in which cookies were offered for sale at different prices depending on the buyer's race or gender. Huh? The sale was organized by the young Conservatives of Texas who said it was intended as a protest of affirmative action. A science that white males had to pay a dollar for a cookie, the price was 75 cents for white women, 50 cents for Hispanics and 25 cents for blacks. What's kind of like the arbitrage mentality, same thing I am reverse. Right? Right? Why people get a buck black in the span of skid a million dollars? Members of the Conservative Group said they meant no offense where they were trying only to protest the use of race or gender as a factor in college admissions. Which I happen to agree with them by the way. Similar sales have been held by college Republican chapters of colleges, at least five of the states in February, a black student filed a complaint with MSM using the sales offensive. What's he complain about? He gets it for a quarter. How do you like them, Dark folks? So always bitching and bitching and belly aching. That's amazing. And that's something if you went on to a carlot and they said, okay, well, you're Hispanics, so we'll give you the car for five grand. And the white guy over there will charge him 10 grand. And the Dark complexity guy, he's going to get it for 50 bucks. And then he files a complaint? How come the white people weren't finally complaint, say? Right. A black student filed a complaint with MSM using the sales offensive SMU officials said they halted the event after 45 minutes because it created a potentially unsafesteged situation. This was not an issue about free speech. Tim Moore directed the SMU students that had said the story for today's edition of the Dallas Morning News. It was really an issue where we had a hostile environment being created. The sales grew a crowd outside the student center and several students engaged in the shouting match Moore said. David C. Rushing 23, a lawsuit in chairman of the Unconservative Texas and MSU in for the state said the event didn't get out of hand. It most it doesn't do and scattered around the table of cookies and rice Krispies treats he said, oh, why did I have to get to that part? You know, the rice Krispies treats with a marshmallow? Sure. They're great. Don't you love that? Especially when they're fresh and still gooing. Oh, and a marshmallow is still like oozing and they're all mushy. You know what else I haven't had in years, which I don't I'd ask and even think about eating? What's the like, are they coming a big jar of marshmallow cream in that every day? Marshmallow topping? Yeah, like real marshmallow, right? Oh, marshmallow. Hmm, fluff. What is it? Fluff. Fluff. Marshmallow fluff. He's talking about most show again. Now we love more. Most are new buddy. We love your mouth. You sell your old coat. We copied what's been done in multiple campuses around the country. We don't illustrate our opinion or affirmative action on how we think it's unfair. Mad Houston, a 19 year old sophomore called the group's priceless defensive. Mad's obviously a white guy. My reaction was discussed because of the ignorance of some SMU students. Oh, said Houston, who's black. What are the black people pissed off about? We're given it to him for a quarter. They were arguing that affirmative action was solely based on race. It's not based on race. It's based on bringing a diverse community of certain organizations. The group sold three cookies during its protest raising a buck and a half, which is more than we've got for a band and per rest to guarantee that right now. A dollar fifty. Do we have that yet today? Oh, I guarantee we don't. And dream car south and 17043 South, fix your highway. He had several calls this way for the band to go down in that area. Aren't you sure that he had the several calls saying, oh, I'm going to get one. You come to dream car south at 1743 South, fix your highway and we'll bring lots and lots of cash for deals. I merchandise and a band of per rest you. Maybe that words. Well, I think that's a pretty good story about the base sale. And so the black kid was upset because he was a mock in affirmative action and stuff. But at the meantime, he's getting a cookie for 25 cents and a white kid's got to pay a buck for it. Never please some people. You know what? Never satisfy certain people. Then people. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I don't know if you talked about it.

Obviously you've got you've met guys that were attractive but they had body odor. Yes I am. Let me out. We're like a son of a bitch. I can't I don't care how good they look. Just tell me to take a shower. That's a good. Yeah. Anyway. That's a good idea. Anyway. I don't think that's necessarily going to help. I think I think some of it does have to do. I don't care what you say. It's skin pigmentation. It's people who's diet whatever. They've been eaten all over their life. I'm telling you that that people from like Pakistan, India, certain other countries parts of the Middle East. It's not just they haven't seen a bar of coast in a long time or they keep dropping it. But it's a skin pigmentation thing. It's just there. And nobody believes me but it's true. I guess I would have had to have the sampled some of those. You had to be close and personal. Okay. Or maybe just go into restaurant where they eat a lot of curry. Okay. Go into restaurant with kid curry and take a sniff. 27 past 11 at 5, 60 WQM.

Speaking of morons, they had the big debate in California last night. Accusing his opponents have tried to pull the wool over the people's eyes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did his best last night to dominate a riot as debate.

Yeah. That's the best part of the whole thing. Hello. Yeah. Contrary to widespread predictions that the forum would be scripted, the candidates bigger than interrupted one another in a 90-minute rhetorical battle. Your personal income tax loophole, I could drive my hummer through a Schwarzenegger who's running for governor as a Republican said The Minister commenced Arianna Huffing the new sounds just like Eva Gabor. Huffing the enshouded down Schwarzenegger when he tried to interrupt her comments about the state budget, this is the way you treat women. We know that she said. I have a perfect part for you, and Terminator 4 he shot back with a grin. In Schwarzenegger's most recent movie Terminator 3 is character, Dougson woman said, in a toilet. The frustrated moderator who at times barely managed to move to the made forward interjected, this is not comedy's central I swear. The event was maker break for Schwarzenegger, and he was far in a way that made attraction in the evening. I can't believe that's because of the media, isn't it? The forum featuring five of the 135 candidate significant replacement Governor Gray, Davis Mark the first time. Schwarzenegger confronted his rivals in person, making it undoubtedly the most highly publicized campaign of at the first time. He's not planning to participate in any other forms of reflection because he's got limited vocabulary. Under intense pressure to prove his viability is a candidate. Schwarzenegger tried to prove his mastery of policy details, citing figures and dollar amounts from time to time. Still he dodged answers to a few questions that it was unclear, for example, whether he supported providing full health care benefits to children of illegal immigrant workers. And the article goes on, says the nastiest exchanges in the world, Schwarzenegger and Huffington who spoke often in Unison for long stretches. Huffington repeatedly compared Schwarzenegger to President Bush, hoping to attach the public increasing when they have impressed with the Bush administration to a Republican rival. Let's make one thing clear on October 8th, it's not going to be Governor Bush, it's going to be Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said. The last thing this state needs is Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger Huffington retorted, something just like Ava Gabor without the pig, finally. After the debate, Huffington said she was so outraged by his interruptions, which he described as sexist, that she would no longer hold back from attacking Schwarzenegger's attitude toward women, speaking to reporters she mentioned interview Schwarzenegger to We We Magazine in the 70s about having group sex. Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bush, he was there by the way. At the Cruz side, neck and neck with Schwarzenegger and a Pulitzer-Mane cool, despite Schwarzenegger's constant interruptions, I didn't interrupt you, Arnold, he said smoothly when Schwarzenegger jumped in a complaint about politicians, and we said, do a little more than smile for photographers, you're what to talk about photo ops Bush the money said. Ooh, nice going Cruz, by Troy. Troy from Bounce for Life was here. Oh hey, how you doing, Troy? How's your been going? Everything okay? Yeah, everything's going well. I'll a squid.

Uh, from what I hear, that's what he's saying, but you know, Okay, well nice to chat with you briefly, Troy. All right, buddy. Then the whole the Bobga News, please. So anyway, getting back to Martina, Martina and I brought to Lovah, who's a lot butcher that Arnold will ever dream of being, will plan to get into Pueber's service after she stops serving following in 2005. Martina. An effort to Lovah turns 47 as my next month said yesterday at the Spark Cassin Cup tournament, then she plans to play through the end of next season. Then she wanted to get involved with the American politics. She says, perhaps running for office.

I looked down and on the top of his hand is this open and infectious oozing sore. Are you sure was his hand? Am I doing part of the ankle? I called the manager and he was nice, but there was nothing he could do. He just got a guy to mop it up. Just that was disgusting as it got from me. Okay, well thanks for letting me check or just had to have a nice day. Tom, don't do it again. Thanks, Pally. Alright. That's advertising him. Sure. I don't know what we would put that down.

Let's do this one more time because they'll rise muffled. You start crying. You're gonna eat the promo. Greg, you're gonna eat the promo. I'll read the promo. Like I said, you should be a rest of the most familiar back. But what that radio station is done for us. I'm taking what they did for us. I think that's the way we put it. Don't do us no more favors. You morons you. And you people that logo, Mar-Man, you talk about having no shame. That's just, I got that letter. I'm saving it. Copy you sent me yesterday. I got five copies. Yeah. If we had a plastered copies on tea rooms, all of our cover up glory holes with all of our sound Florida. Don't do that. Take one. I'll take one. I'll take one. I'll take one. I'll take one.

All you morons fans that say tonight's game don't forget to stop by gate G's starting at five o'clock because for now we'll be out there hosting the wireless party yet. And it'll be on Fox Sportsnet. The wireless fan showing his or her true colors will join Billy the Mar-Man along with the Murbates and for Rauh for a while. Well, I'll tell you he's sure a self-promoter. I'll say that. Yeah. Well, that was a nice way of putting it. For a wild ride on his boat during the game and get tickets to Saturdays game along with other Marlins merchandise. That's the game against the anxious meds. The QM price which will be on hand passing out 560 WM wild cards. We don't have any bumper stickers on this God for second station but we got wild cards. Do we know what that is? I don't know. There'll be balloon artists making custom Marlon team balloons for the kids who stop by gate G at the QM promo booth and fans can come out of QM promo booth and get their bodies painted showing their two Marlins colors. I wonder who's going to be doing the body painting? I guess it all depends on which fan stop by and show up. 560, 560, 560, on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Your biggest gross up. In fact, I'm looking at a well, a blue screen right now and that's grossing me on. Here's a pepper pie. Hello. Neil, God. How are you today? I love your show. I always love that area. Not much to say. My wife is still great. She swallows. But my biggest gross out. How about plumbers crack? You get it? 560, 560, pound 560, on the AT&T. Then Verizon wireless line. Oh, you get it. Apparently. Here's a call from Boca, hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you? You just said the magic work. You said pound 560. And I'm on my AT&T wireless phone. I was at work the other day and I walked it all the way to the mall and game when they played. I guess it was the fillings in the afternoon when they had the hurricane at 1 o'clock. Alright. Stop pound 560. I put my headset on so no one knew I was listening to the game. And I got to build my AT&T bill for $49 for listening to that game because it was not a free call. Alright. So, is it a free call or not? Not when a Marlins are on. Not when the Marlins are on? No. When a Marlins are on, we charge a double. No, it is a factory. Well, I shouldn't do that anymore. You have enough of me. What does that mean? It means I thought that could have just turned on the radio and listened to the game for free. How did you see on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line? And here's a man who paid 50 bucks to listen on the phone. Instead of listening for free on a radio. I think you got what you deserve. Don't you? Oh. He just figured it out. He doesn't have to put any coins in the radio to make it work. He just figured that out. Oh, he thought that CD slot was a coin nut. He could have brought his Sony a walkman and put that on instead of having to got him phone and his ear. He could have done that and had the little accord and his ear. I thought I wanted to say, well, I know. You're following us? Yeah. Speaking of 560. Yes? 560. Well, be nice to make this 600 anyway. Wouldn't it be a moral victory more minutes? We got till one o'clock. Three and a half more minutes till one. Miguel is there a dream car. One 74 or three South to see highway.

The bubble boy guy, my favorite. And by the way, back at you. George W. Bush is in the worst political trouble of his presidency according to a new NBC news Wall Street Journal, Paul released last night. Bush is a approval rating now stands at just 49% the lowest point of his 10 year. Well, the Democrats will be able to exploit his woes is unknown, yati, yati, with only 50 months until the general election. The president and his political strategists have their work out for him, especially in ensuring skittish voters that his plans to stabilize Iraq will work. Presented in the NBC news, Wall Street Journal pulled with various options for raising the money to pay for the Iraqi project. 56% of respondents said they'd offer repeating the portion of the tax cuts that Congress has made that benefits upper income taxpayers. But he liked that. I like it. And it goes on a great length. It's on our website, by the way, it's from MSNBC. And the headline NBC pulled Bush rating lowest ever. It's on our website, read it and jump for joy. And you bush people out there. Shame on you. You can weed like good stuff. You can sit around a cry like a baby. Bloodling Steve to Rolex slang. You were telling me about this story before. Traject. Lodling's Rolex Steve to driveway killing says the heroine and ex-con with the history of Snatching, oh, there's that word again. Snatching expensive Rolexes is wounded either run in the and the prime suspect in the driveway sling of a prominent coconut-growing businessman. My police chief John Timoni said yesterday. Anthony Craig Lee. 31 cropped as blocks from the street of $0.00 homes where Jose Calva was shot in the street as he gave up his diamond-acquested Rolex and ring the evening of September 18. Lee was tied to the shooting death by the blood found in his getaway car. The niece Calva was a cow-dose-wide shot at the fleeing man. Hit him in the left side. Lee's DNA was in the state's criminal database due to his violent history offering police an easy match. He should be considered armed and dangerous in may seek medical care. Timoni said, Greg Ormond attorney for niece Calva said Wednesday. She's pleased to know they've identified the suspect. But one of Lee's previous victims is saying, Lee should have served more time in prison for the previous crimes and he is, Mr. Calva would still be allowed today if Lee had been given time for shooting me said Ron Garalnik, who was shot in Rob by Lee in 1992. He would have been incarcerated for a more significant part of his life. In 1990s Lee was a member of the proficient Rolex robbers band pulling off a string of hold-ups. There's a lesson here folks don't wear Rolex watch. No, death magnets. Police eventually busted him and other members of the group who targeted owners of the expensive timepiece. Lee took a plea deal on at least two such robberies according to court records and prosecutors and served ten years who was released in May. Now Lee faces a first-degree murder charge in Calva's death, but police nickes Fred South Florida, however they know exactly where his mother ended up, and custody at the Miami-Dade County jail. On Tuesday detective search Lee's family house at 3762 Day Avenue in a grove they found a black pouch containing crack cocaine and charged Vernika Lee 50. How you doing Vernika? With position within ten a possession with intent to sell according to the police. They had hoped to find Calva's Rolex and ring inside the home, but those items likely himself are missing. There's no indication that he's tried to pawn them said Miami homicide, Lieutenant Daniel the Mingaz. After his release from prison five months ago, Lee returned to the Cinder Block home on day Avenue just blocked in the driveway where Calva was shot in the hede. They were one of the original families. They had their problems but they were fine said John Williams, who said his family is owned the day Avenue house and they're all, they're early behaving in insistious settlement the grove in early 1900s. They're behaving in ancestors. William said he is known these parents since they were children, but never so much of their son. Williams was shocked when told he was wanted by police in the coffin of an murder. I knew they've been some trouble. I didn't take really to that he said yad yad. Lee's crowned a record dates back to 1988 including 14 arrests for charges and included attempted murder and drug possession and of course 92 convicted of those police robberies and they said 10 years is enough. So now this guy is dead. There you go there's the American justice system for you. Now speaking of crack cocaine if we would have been found with a pin joint in his possession he'd probably got about 20 you know. Keep him stanched away for a long long time with it without his dash. After America for you, are you pot smokers out there? 10 to 20 baby no parole no peep bargaining. 5 6 7 now do we get a final total from a yo? 6 80. But that's not too bad. We'll take it. I mean it's not great it's not spectacular but it's a start it's almost 700 bucks last time I checked and maybe we'll actually get like an up to day total on our band and pair rescue on our best Neil campaign which is limping and howling along. Because we got a lot of real cheap free loading bastards in south or real real cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap free loaders is what we got. Make no mistake about it. If we had 5000 free Marlon tickets for the phones would be smoking and they'd be smoldering. We would bust out the guy damn phone lines if we had a whole crapload of Marlon tickets to give you. Of course if you have to pay for your own you they're going to buy them. No. I had a laugh reading about the in I guess it was the hero. Yesterday about the long lines of people starting early in the morning on Tuesday for the first release game. Well if that's the case how come they only had 25000 people. Scott. I don't know. Yeah long lines. I mean it just everybody in their brother wanted those tickets but when they got to a certain number I guess they just said okay that's it. They're probably sold out now.

I just have to No weapons have mass destruction been found in Iraq by the group looking for them according to a bush administration source who is spoken to the BBC This will be the conclusion of the Iraq survey groups in a report source totally present or BBC's television daily's politics show Andrew Neill Townings to be branded the story speculation about an unfinished draft of an interim report Mr. Neill said the draft report which the source said is due to be published next month concludes that it is highly unlikely that weapons of mass destruction were shipped out of the country to places like Syria before the Westland war and Iraq The bottom line is as Mr. Neill but the team has found no weapons of mass destruction It also says that Saddam Hussein mounted a huge program to deceive and hinder the work of UN and weapons inspectors Mr. Neill said that according to the source to report will say its inspectors not even on earth My new amounts of nuclear chemical or biological weapons material I've also not uncovered any laboratory is involved in deploying weapons of mass destruction and no delivery systems for the weapons What about those underground rail cars with the mobile laboratories in them? You know the part of the media landed the report would publish computer programs files pictures and paperwork Which it says shows that Saddam's regime was attempting to validate weapons of mass destruction program But he liked that. Okay So there are no weapons of mass destruction. There weren't any there aren't any he was thinking about it He was working on it. He was hoping for it, but they weren't any and that's why those people over there are dying and did die and are continuing to every single day unbelievable I still can't get over that thing about corporate has to permit See so in other words, there really aren't putting the thing on promoting our our campaign Oh, it's on there thinking about it.
