I'm Mary Kane, they don't come any better than Neal Rock. It's non-romantic Uworth Whe Nothing Y'all prescribed... The Night of the Year I say to you tonight and hear me well, you ain't seen nothing yet. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I'm really proud and happy to be here with you. It's great to be back in Harlem. We shot basketball together. One of the last times I was here. Powered in and out, traveling from here to Iowa. And I'm going to make a more extensive speech. I see a rapist a little bit later today, but. I said when I announced last year that I was not going to be a candidate for president myself, that I would endorse one of the candidates who is running. And I had no idea at that time, which candidate that would be. But I have watched this campaign and I have listened to all of the candidates. I think it's a great field. There are a lot of great democratic candidates out there. But one of them is to say, doesn't come as a secret or as a surprise to anybody within the sound of my voice. And that is that, how are Dean really is the only candidate who has been able to inspire at the grassroots level all over this country, the kind of passion and enthusiasm for democracy and change and transformation of America that we need in this country. We need to remake the democratic party. We need to remake America. We need to take it back on behalf of the people of this country. So I'm very proud and honored to endorse Howard Dean to be the next president of the United States of America. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Democracy is a team sport. And I want to do everything I can to convince the anybody that is interested in my judgment about who among these candidates has the best chance to win and the best chance to lead our country in the right direction. I want to do everything I can to convince you to get behind Howard Dean and let's make this a successful campaign as a group. It is about all of us and all of us need to get behind the strongest candidate. Now, I respect the prerogative of the voters and the caucuses and in the primaries and I'm just one person. But I'm offering my judgment and I'm also going to say one other thing here. Years ago, the former president Ronald Reagan said in the Republican Party that there ought to be an 11th amendment. Speaking of ill of another Republican, well, now we're Democrats and we may not find that kind of commandment as accessible. But to the extent that we can recognize the stakes in America today, I would urge all of the other candidates and campaigns to keep their eyes on the prize. Here we are in Harlem. We need to keep our eyes on the prize. This nation cannot afford to have four more years of a Bush-Chainee administration. We can't afford to keep the bite of the money ourselves to the point that we lose sight of how important it is for America. What is going on in this Bush-White House today is bad for our country. And it's slowly beginning to sink into more and more people out there. We don't have the luxury of fighting among ourselves to the point where we seriously damage our ability to win on behalf of the American people this time around. Now, one other thing, I've spent a long time thinking about national security and national defense. I've heard a lot of folks who, in my opinion, made a judgment about the Iraq war that was just plain wrong, saying that our deans decision to oppose the Iraq war calls his judgment on foreign policy and the question will excuse me. He was the only major candidate who made the correct judgment about the Iraq war. And he had the insight and the courage to say and do the right thing. And that's important because those judgments that basic common sense is what you want in a present. Our country has been weakened in our ability to fight the war against terror because of the catastrophic mistake that the Bush administration made in taking us into war in Iraq. It was also been lawden that attacked us, not Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein is a bad guy and he's better off not in power, all better off. But it was a mistake to get us into a quagmire over there. So don't tell me that because our dean was the only major candidate who was right about that war that that somehow calls his judgment into question on foreign policy. So whether it is inspiring enthusiasm at the grassroots and promising to remake the democratic party as a force for justice and progress and good in America, whether it is a domestic agenda that gets our nation back on track or whether it is protecting us against terrorists and strengthening our nation in the world. I have come to the conclusion that in a field of great candidates, one candidate clearly now stands out. And so I'm asking all of you to join in this grassroots movement to elect our dean president of the United States. Thank you. You've all gone there. Go where was that algorithm four years ago? Yeah, he made two great speeches since then and he wonder where was why didn't he speak like that four years ago? Although I like the way dean introduced him he said is the elected president of the United States. That's correct. Yes, it is. And these fascist stole it right in broad daylight, right in front of your eyes right there in Florida. And when I say right in front of your eyes, I'm thinking of that one big guy, you know, the judge that was holding it valid up, but hang in Chad and Palm Beach, Google. I Google eyes. Yeah, I'm thinking Google search and I'm Google eyes. So Al Gore endorses Howard Dean and we're pretty pleased about that. We're pleased this punch on this show about that because Howard Dean the man. I just hope hey, Howard, don't be another Michael Ducac as please. Oh, God. Now there I got a word, man, as much as I like Howard Dean, I think he's terrific, but I sometimes he has looks on his face. They're just, I don't know, you want to say, but you'd have to try to be a Ducac as though. Would you? Yeah. Really, I think a couple of him. She's kind of a gray guy anyway. He'd have to get a slack jaw because well, there was one thing about Ducacus that bothered everybody right off the bat. Oh, he's a little guy, kind of funny. Yeah, he came up to your kneecap. Anyway, Terry Lester died. Thanks to one of our chronic facts is for a fact you miss him. I have no idea who that is. And your best known for his roles in soap operas, the young and a restless, the young and a horny, he with the original Jack Abbott, not his crime jackets on there now. Santa Barbara is Mason Capwell and as the world turns as your worm turns, Royce Keller, a period in prime time TV shows like StarDreck Voyager, Jag, Fag, Dallas and diagnosis murder died last week and December 1st, it eats 53. Okay, okay, cause of the TVA. Let's see how that pull come out yesterday. And out to many wheel religionists in this crowd of artists, thank the Lord for that. Excellent. Please, does punch to see that too. Lot of punch and going on. 1146 votes. How often do you attend religious services? Never. 649. 56.6%. Oh, right, go boys and girls. Rarely 308. 26.8% you had those to numbers to give you got 83.4%. Rarely or never go to a show to church to a mosque. They might wear a mosque every now and then like to the mosque ball. A goss mosque. Only on Major Holiday's 90, 7.8% yeah, that if we're well of her 90%. And that leads fairly often 55.4.7% probably through a lot of heavy pressure and brainwashing from their families. And very often, we're religiously 44.8% almost definitely as we've heard of the above mentioned. So that's you take the last to fairly often very often religiously. You got 8.5% which means 91.5% at all or like just about maybe once in a blue moon. Speaking of blue moon, how's the Marcel's doing? But a big day today. Let me give you a hint. Yep, right. 60th birthday. Oh, and yes, what's his birthday? Let's do it for both, okay. Okay. Big birthday today for Shelley Bloom. And for Jim Morrison. The difference being Shelley's still alive. Jim Morrison would be 60 today. We got that story a little later on. Rayman Zerick was a real asshole was talking about it. You see him on there? Yeah, yeah. They're the super intellectual Rayman Zerick. Well, you know, I wish we still had that tape, you know? No, I'm glad we don't because we play it. Just the sound of Rayman Zerick's voice. I mean, a real sued. In fact, you really have a super intellectual dictionary. Rayman Zerick's picture. There's no wonder Jim Morrison killed himself. He's a real asshole. We don't realize that. He often. He just wreck himself today. Kind of like Ozzy. Ozzy had a little bit of a problem. We got all kinds of heavy duty stuff today. Here's the first pull. And we'll take some suggestions along. We've done these recently, but it is the holidays. And you know, if you've specced me to come. Now, what are all those calls on there? That's a WQA. I'll take some suggestions for both of them. Yes, sir. Are you a family? Yeah. That was good. Yeah. That was excellent. Was it? Love it. That sounded almost. Wait a minute. Listen. That was so close to the original. Hi, Paulie. No, he must be a play in an off-a-take. You think he could have done that good of a job? There it is. There's a play out there. Hi, Paulie. That was the umptious fat boy. I'm almost sure. Anyway, we'll get to a lot more great calls like that momentarily. And first pull today in what city in the world you find the best looking people. Prague, Miami, Toronto, Boston, or any other cities you want to add on there. Those are the ones I, my short list. Any arguments with any of those? Well, I put Miami under just because some people never left Hawaii. Say that, just because. Yeah. 1013 at 560 WQA. After years, the failed attempted mergers with cable news channels.

Wouldn't that be beautiful? I love it. The weekend, I'm shot. 10 19 at 5 60 WQM. Let's get to more cities for this list where you find a best looking people in the world. Of course, a lot of you that never been more than 10 blocks from sweet water. What do you even know, huh? We should probably put sweet water on there. Probably get a whole bunch of both. But we won't. I just told Eric to add spokane. Spokane? Washington. Never been in spokane. Never been in the great northwest. Beautiful clean, steady, beautiful park in the middle of it. And hot baves everywhere. We should also probably put cologne Germany on there. But nobody in this crowd ever been there. Wow. Woo, man. That'll just make you just a week at the knees when you see them. People in cologne Germany. Can we run around going like that over? Wow. Can that be felt? Cologne Germany, COL, OG, any. You got it? Actually, they spell that. Hey, OLN, but we're not going to do no trimon. We have plenty of time for that. COL, OG, any. Got it? That's your way. You still. Loan. Got it. Anyway, let's, uh, and of course the bear. I quoted the bear factories right outside the city. Oh, it's a beautiful thing. Does they have a vase? You will enjoy popping a couple of them every day. WDQAM. Put the boy. Who made you want a podcast that from that theater? Uh. WDQAM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Pretty good. Hey, you know, I just heard you talking about religion. I got to taste something really quick. You know, I have a very close family. I'm not a very religious person at all. But my, well, certain members of my family have become very religious. And it's amazing what religion will do to a family that was close. But we're still very close. But the arguments that happen are incredible. Oh, hey. I try to stay away from these conversations. And I can't get out of them every time I talk with. Religion reads hate. Really? I'm the retake. Oh, yeah. It's the top. Because you're not saying you, you must believe whoever you're talking to. You must believe there for retail. Otherwise, you just, uh, you're not going to get saved. And I mean, I, I listen to a lot of things you say. And I know you joke around a lot. But I mean, a lot of them are so true. And I, and I, and I bring it up. And I get, I mean, you can't imagine what happens to me when I do. When I say the thing that you say. But I truly believe it. I don't know what the belief is. Yeah. That's my, that's my attitude. I don't know what to believe in. But I'm not going to say anything. You don't know what to believe in. Why do you have to believe in anything? That's true. But, I mean, the way they are about it. I mean, they're so, I mean, they don't sit me down and talk to me for, like, a half an hour to an hour. And, and, and I just don't, I mean, they started talking about Noah's arc the other day. Mm. And I'm sorry. I just, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I. Listen, I, I mean, you don't tell anybody over the age of eight who were believed that those very tales know is arc and all the animals, two of all the animals. I mean, believe a story like that has to be some kind of a more on, they need Seki Afterkel. And they're, uh, they're simple. God came down and told Noah. No, for you, forget about that. I forget about that. I'm happy to have a word. And he was the one guy was going to build this gigantic craft. Then capture all of the animals. Forget about that. But I'm plus he was a drunk to top it all off. But, no, but just keep in mind that here is a guy who, uh, got rather, who killed everything else. In other words, everything else that couldn't work get on the arc. They all died. Even the animals. I mean, all we needed was a male and a female of all the other species, which sounds pretty species to me. And then that was it. Everything all the other animals died because I guess they were evil. Oh, or maybe just God didn't really give a crap about him. Well, I thought like God likes what Noah was drinking, so I'll have what he would have. Never done like that. Tom to get lost man. Tom left their full load. And have a great day. Thank you. DNA, Stu, no harm. That's all. All these idiots. These peddlers of bull crab, and because they want to control your mind. They want to control everything you do. All of the Bible says this. And by the way, one dead 14, the injured net, the theater of Tom theater. The other day that the asshole was talking about. Yeah, I wasn't in there too bad. You lose. I'm still here. And I'll be here for a long time. Three more excruciating years. Every day and they accept for those 30 weeks vacation. I get every year.

They must be talking about cemetery village. Maybe they're into old folks. WQAM. Hey, who's talking to me? Speaking. Oh, thank you. Hello. Yes. We're in a... Did you find the drugs at one of the... Oh, God. WQAM, hello. Hey, Uncle Mia, how you doing? Yes, sir. Okay. Hey, I'd like to add Salt Lake City to you. Salt Lake City, Utah, Bobbi, that's real pristine and pretty. The women are just in much beautiful women you've ever seen. And they can take probably 20 or 30 of them and make them your wife. No, they're gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately, I probably won't get too many votes because not so many people have been there. But... You have to be a moron, more Mormon to believe in. Fantastic, please. Okay, thanks, Pally. Okay. I'm not marking it on my list of places to see and do though. Sir, Salt Lake City, Utah. Weeks. Are you... Have you been there? Yes, I have. Or in Snatch bin there, the city is very clean. The Mormons are good looking people in case you hadn't noticed. Yes, I have noticed. The ones in a bicycle is with a white shirts and a nice black ties. Oh, I think if you were that magic underwear too long, sir, get a little gimme. That fustling brine pit really smells. Really? Yeah. Anyway, the people are pretty good looking at, okay? So get real louts on the outskirts of town up on a hill somewhere and just get some binoculars. Miami 16, Toronto 5, Prague 5, Boston 1, Colone has got one already as spoken. Just went out there. What do we have now? Salt Lake City. Got a list. We're going to get that list going pretty soon because we got to do the other one. They are what we don't have to, but we will. Or maybe not. We should. We should what? Do the other one. Tomorrow? Okay. See, always hold something back. There's a little lesson for it. If something looks like it might, because it's going to take a long time to build this one. We got to get a whole bunch of names on there. It doesn't have to try these scientific values that are fully usually has, you know? Because this is very important crack. It kills some very valuable time. Bimbost-Port-Tray Bush has a bozo. Oh, that's great coming up after the break. Should I give you a little tease? Could you? There are a group of women in Southeastern Michigan say they'll use pictures of scantly Cloud Baves.

Well good morning. This is former VF president and former president, Joe Canada, Al Gore. I'm here to wash the rumors. I am alive. I used to be the land who was in control. I used to be the man who was on a roll. Now I just sent home in my on-leaf and songs. Looking for that key to my damn lot box. I'll take Chaining. If you think you're a special, I'll take Chaining. You think you're a fufu-al. So you're Mr. Popular VP. That don't impress me much. If you're at least the status I am and you're all in. Now don't get me wrong. I think you're all right. But how many times does your heart beat at night? You don't impress me much. You're a fufu-al. So fast. Now onto your boss. Who's the real big man he should ride. Thank you notes to Afghanistan.

But how many bears do your girls drink at night? You don't impress me much. You don't impress the real president. A real lion. And what about me? Look at me. I am a snowy reprocession. I'm a snowy reprocession. I'm a foreshee. I'm a foreshee. I'm a foreshee. I'm a foreshee. I'm a foreshee. No, I'm beautiful. I'm 34. I'll tell you, he looked a little bit better. He had that hair down over the side of his head. I kind of like Hitler this morning. You don't want to say that beard. Right on, he needs to get that little mustache back. Because that seems to be in with a lot of America today. Could I ask Arthur, please just stop the facts in this picture that won't come in a minute. Oh, and also that's why I can't get my facts to do. Because I just created a second, a new second pull for today. Will Schmidt can the other one leave it for tomorrow. First of all, it takes an hour to print out and then it's distorted and blurry. Arthur, quick, the touch king around. Well, yeah, I'm trying to, well, here you can write it down. You can say Eric. Sorry, Eric. I hate to do this, dear. Why really don't? In fact, I'm right. I'm going to send you 600 bedtime stories. Just to keep you of the kitchen. Don't you think I'm doing him a public service when I sent him a whole bunch of stuff? Only if the facts machine was in another room. Oh, and I'll read you think it's probably in the kitchen. I don't know. I'll read you today for a little later on because this first one, I will see what gets some of the cities. All of when you see my name, he's got 28 votes to write one, Prague of that 11. I mean, I guess that figures. I mean, most of the people spend most of their time right there, right? And they, you know, go to a win more in cemetery village and places like that. And it's like, oh, my God, what beautiful 90 year old people. I'm sure they're thinking about South Beach and whatnot. South Beach and Fort Lauderdale Beach. Right. And we'll manage. What's your take on Al Gore's? I seriously, I have never been in anywhere other than Montreal. That's the worst. But I've never been anywhere where when you're like in a highway, you're on an I5, the turnpike, whatever, 595. And you'll look around, you know, you're observing the traffic. And of course you're hoping you might see somebody pretty hot. And you never do. You did it. I mean, maybe you just just don't. You always wonder, where, where did the spaceship plan? What been animals? They just hop off of what the old folks home to. They escaped from. You don't what I mean? Very seldom. Did you see anybody? I don't know. And that kind of evercrabian fish look. You know what I'm talking about? I do. But I can walk outside here, for example, and within like a one block walk, a whole a crap, whatever you want, man. It's there. I've a crab in bitch. But in South Florida, I think in fact, that's why I've been so successful for many many years. You know, I'm 30. I was, because I'm so ugly and people can relate to me. Fat, ugly, balding, fag, old, right? They can relate to that, aging rapidly. You're the second floor. You're going to write this down? Yeah. I should try to fix it to you again. But I don't know if there's something, F. Up with your fast machine. Probably Arthur's father's. You're an idiot, Arthur. What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement? Howard Dean. Here's my five choices. It will help Dean a lot. Are you writing this down? Yeah. So I pause. Whatever. It makes, should I read like one word at a time? That'll kill some good time. It is the holidays. It makes no difference. It'll actually hurt Dean. I'm sure some people would agree with that. Although it's kind of a stupid choice. But some people will vote for that. By the way, Julie, we're going to have to. Oh, because running mate, this blindsided old Jewelie, woman, which I'm glad to see that. Because that man, he makes me. I would vote 100 times for Al Sharpton before I even think about voting for Julie, woman. How do you like that? Right? Right. And Al got 200 grand in court the other day, so maybe he'd loan us a few bucks. But I vote for anybody before I vote for Julie, woman. Not Bush. I would just leave the country. Are I already have? It guarantees the nomination for Dean. That's your fourth choice. And last but not least, of course, I don't care I'm for Bush, which we will trace those votes. It'll come to your house and the lock and tie you up on election day. Of course, they won't need your vote anywhere. It'll be fixed. This could be next year. This could be the last election ever in the US. That's my prediction. I thought, and in fact, if we have it, if we have it, right? If we have it, read that again. Just to make sure. What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement? Well, this is for a little later on, like Nunesh. What's your take on Al Gore's endorsement of Howard Dean? It will help Dean a lot. Got it? Yep. It makes no difference. It will actually hurt Dean. Got it? Mm-hmm. It guarantees denomination for Dean, or I don't care. I'm for Bush. Got that? Got it? A group of women in Southeast and Michigan say they'll use pictures of scantily clad babes in an effort to smash George W Bush's reelection hopes. Babes against Bush is the group calls itself finds to use pin-up girls as the meeting for its anti-bush message. All right. Babes against Bush's created a liberal leaning campaign to promote political awareness to the most unlikely of audiences, men whose cultural taste tend towards setterfolds and these swimsuit issues of sports magazines to groups set to press release in other words, the sports nerds who listen to QM their other 20 hours of the day. Those folks. We figured that this was a good thought of way to make people aware of the damage George Bush is doing in America said Babes against Bush model, Elinore vast binder. Guys like hot girls, so maybe they would mind getting the message from us. They'd like to get something from you, honey. Maybe that maybe I'm reading it wrong, getting the message from us. The group is offering what it calls a regime change countdown calendar which ticks off the days until Operation Day 2005 when a group published Bush v. Displaced by an actual elected president. Oh, I like that! That'll be novel. They're ticking it off. The calendar, the last election ticked everybody off except the Bush likers. The calendar features 13 photos of provocatively dressed around dressed models, but is also a chronology of the Bush administration's misdeeds, and manglings of the truth the group said. In other words, bald-faced lies. What better ways they're to get guys to notice that the president is a bozo commented January babe vast binder. Pictures of the girls will get their retention they'll look long enough to read the fine print. Or yeah, they'll be looking at the space, especially if they put the fine print in the right place. Kind of like in the Bush? You don't have to be beautiful to hate George's W. Bush's group's website. Says I can certainly vouch for that. You know what I mean? Oh, good. Right. Because there are few who hate him more than I do. Let's have a contest. Okay. What's the question? Athens Greece, okay. As Jim, who's the facts is continued to just amazin' his staff. I think Jim is trying to make the Guinness Book a record for the most consecutive facts with the shortest number of four. In fact, you could have just written Athens. Jim, we know where Athens is. Is that Athens? Yes. That's right. Athens, Georgia, that's where the Virgin Mary keeps popping up. Damn it, they're she's again. Let's see, what do they, what does that say? In regards to two by each and no was arc, what if one of them animals were past, or this is past reading age, tool to get pregnant? Oh, badness, steak, Noah. In fact, maybe that's why I hold a lot of the animals from those days. Those pre-a-scoric times. I mean, pre-centible times. Maybe that's why we don't have no more. You think? They're right. The dinosaurs wouldn't fit. Remember they thought I said that? They could don't get sore about it. In fact, remember, we're a CD USA in your Chevrolet. We've made dinosaurs every time we brought that up, especially when I talked about Bert Reynolds Wig. And the fact that he might be a fact. Now, we don't believe that Bert, how's Bert and Jackson doing? Anybody seen him lately? No. We're a mystery. We go eat and free these days. But what's Bert and Jackson, when that honored, that must have been really a bad day in his life. To which we say?

So, you're going to win. Yes. The decilence get right to the things that the most talk about of recent data and that's crisis. You have had a financial problem. You know Larry, I'm not making so much money these days. We are told that you have your part of the financial problem. Oh, definitely. Yes. And I think that. Well, I sort of have an inside track you know what I mean. That's what I mean. A storage of the truth somewhere in the vicinity of 700 billion dollars. Did you know it was that much? No, I'd be at 700 billion. Billion, yes. Your kidding. He's everything. You know what they say? Yeah, bitch. She might you. Montestort fraud. That's true. She's falling apart. Bankruptcy actually. This is a business Larry King live. Don't go away. 1046 and 560 WDQM. So anyway, Leigh on France. We're going to put that one under L. Y. Owen. Sure, whatever.

That's almost the maze we get. 62 to 38% say that Gore's endorsement will help Howard Dean. I think what they're really trying to say is, what's not to like? Right. Right. And that'll go away and put it. I think that's what we're trying to say. Here's something not to like. A suicide bomber blew up a car pack with explosives at the gates of military barracks today, entering 41 American troops in six Iraqi civilians. Hours earlier, three soldiers died in a road accident in Central Iraq and three civilians died when a bag dead mask was robbed.

This year looks like it's gonna be exciting in the NFL. One team to definitely watch out for other green-bay peckers. Cut, Tarzy, that's peckers. One. Peckers, green-bay peckers. Not peckers? Okay, okay. Oh, he's done again. He's done it over. Get a music. In the IFC Central, you have to watch out for the upstock Cleveland Browns. Browns. What the f*** is a Brown? Cut. Oh, how about those New England guys? The f***ing patriots or something like that? They reminds me of, when I was growing up in England. Right here, Birmingham. We were poor, family. Azihah, stickin' a script to the camp where you're gonna... Fuck you, I'm the prince of f***ing football. Cut. Cut. Shun. Peckers, Browns. In the NFL scene, you have to like the falkins, the bears, the panthers and lions. Jesus Christ, I feel like I'm in line with the f***ing zoo. Well, he's f***ing f***ing some panthers and sh***ing. It's just football and mutual of Omaha's wild f***ingdom. Cut it. That's all that's on the cue code, man. What do you want me to do about it? That just wrapped in a party. Let's hold for this week five hours of the Osmole. The breach of f***ing football. Let's go. Three, at five, 60WM, there you're showing on CNN. The US helicopter made a hard landing. That was an accident near Feludio, but nobody got hurt. Okay. Seriously, it was an accident, but nobody got hurt. Here's a fact, this is, please take the Miami vote down. That's the resident idiot vote, detraction the true poll. Mucky jungle would be more specific choice of allowing Miami to be choice. Well, we have to do that as much as it pains me because we have many very Perocular people and a lot of slupperers too. A lot of homeless, a lot of people on the rubber rafts who never get out of town. So what do they know? Miami's got 74 on what city would you find the best looking people in the world? Miami 74, Prague 18, Kiloan 15, Toronto 14, Hollywood, California. Where'd that come from? 11? You speak that in on me, but that's a good show. Oh, yeah, from the US. The weekend is 7, Salt Lake, City 6, Boston 6, Rome, Italy, 5, Leon, France. How come we got Rome Italy, but we don't have, okay. I don't care. Leon 3, Athens 3 and City Australia. 3. Suicide blast near Moscow hotel kills 5. Oh, hey. Just the only moments ago, a suicide bomber blew herself up outside the National Hotel. Across from Moscow's red square today, killing five bystanders when he at least 12. And sparking fears of a new wave of terror attacks in the heart of the Russian capital. Politics isn't said the state do more or lower house of parliament might have been the intended target, not the hotel. Well, sometimes they got bad aim like the US, you know, like, and oops. Yeah, Chinese embassy. The attack came shortly before President Vladimir Putin addressed a meeting nearby at the Kremlin in two days after Russian parliamentary elections. Moscow mayor Lutzkov said that there was at least one possibly two female bombers. They appeared to be lost before the blast gasing direction. So they stayed Duma. Oh, he had lost suicide bombers. That's the worst. Man. And more of startling news. The Lug found in a car of the man charged with kidnapping Jewish Shodans matches the Missing College students DNA. Is her said today? I say, let's kill him on TV. Okay. Or let's just hang him up by his balls. Run on TV until he tells us where she is and then they will kill him. Okay. The preliminary match confirmed by a law enforcement source who's spec of course on a condition of anonymity. It would be the most significant yet authorities attempts to convicted sets off Fender Alpazzo. Rod Regas, Jr. at the University of North Dakota student disappearance, never trust anybody named Rod Regas. Look what happened when he sent Pudge Pack, huh? Always be aware of anybody named Rod Regas. See. The source also confirmed reports that a knife-handed Rod Regas truck matched a knife-sheet. Found your Shodans car in a parking lot of the Grand Forrest Shopping Mall where she vanished November 22. He's been charged with her kidnapping his moon ford or 2002 Mercury Sables impotted. Uh, this is story. Have all the background in this, uh, because we've had it. The fact that they elect this son of a bitch out. That's where we, he's convicted rapist with a history of attempted kidnapping with the all women. As you the weapon and at least want to solve, he was registered as a predatory offender. Their classification of those believed to be at the highest risk of committing another sex crime and did not disappoint. He was released from a Minnesota prison and may after serving 23 years for an attempted induction 1979. Wayne Swanson who prosecuted Rod Regas said he tried to abduct a woman off the street and stabbed her when she fought back. So there we go. We keep, I mean 23 years maybe 23 years might be okay, but 23 years obviously wasn't enough. Damn it. 560. Let's get to more cities on this list while this pool till noon, okay? And then we'll get to the real me to the matter the algorithm door. And I should play that thing again like four or five times and we can go home. Okay. WDQAM. 5. Ken, what's going on? How you doing sir? Um, the city was the best looking people is real, do you sure now, or for the little? Real. Yes. Where the men are women in the women and women are men. Not well, the women are, are exceptional. Okay. We got you down, pal. Thanks. Alright. Thanks. I still a way go. Rio de Janeiro. Brazil. It's a long awaited tip, Rary. I told you one time years ago I was going to go to sail Paulo. In fact, I even had my reservation booked and I looked at the map and I realized the trip was like nine and a half hours. I said, I don't think so. That's what we done there with the penguins are. Yeah. Well, really, really much further from Miami. It's like about nine hours. It's a long long, slept man. You could fly to like, you can fly to London in the late six in, well, that's a lot of it. How far is the test here? Like 20, one hour or so. I've never seen that. Somebody called once and said, oh my god. I can't imagine doing that even in business class even though he got out. luxurious comfort of business class. I can't imagine 21 hours is like a whole day. You never take it like a cross country bus trip. No. Don't thank you. I've done it seven times. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T and Verizon world of finance. Speaking of that, not that I want to bring up bad news. But whatever happened, remember that the series of Greyhound bus, the hijackings that took place there? What? Random crazy people? Like two or three? Yeah. Yeah. Don't you remember that was right around the history. They tried to tie it. They couldn't throw it on the heels of that. Wasn't it? It was just lunatics. They tried to tie it and they couldn't so forget about it. I see. So not just take the bus and leave the driving to us. That's right. Go first. WQM. Hey, I want you to talk to me. I want to give him a city. Speaking, sir. Doesn't this just not kneel? Is she what it is? Oh kneel. Good morning. How are you doing? I'm doing great. How are you doing? Okay. Cape Town, South Africa. Get out of town. Cape Town, South Africa? Yes. Okay. Yeah. Very beautiful woman. Blond and blue eyes. Woo! That German blood. What could I tell you? Probably kidnapped him from Sweden, no doubt. Thanks a lot, pal. Okay. You take care of him. Cape Town, South Africa. Unlikely source, but there's a few white folks down there. In fact, I mostly buy folks in South Africa. They should've owned them. Darkies up into the jungles. Depending on which hood you're in. Right. Well, it's really sad what's going on over there. And of course, there were oblivious. You just listen to the Pope and George W. Don't talk about birth control and any of them classes. Otherwise, we're going to take away your AIDS funding. And certainly, don't be using no condoms. Otherwise, the Pope's going to make sure you burn and hell. And you put it in a bad word for you. So it's kind of like a catch. And there's a lot of bad things. 560505060. It's just it's so sad, man. It is so sad when you start listening to religious nuts. When is it the people in power? Like they are in a Vatican and in the US and Washington. And in so many other places in the world. Then you have to go, like that. What the hell chance of we got? Because like I told you yesterday, in a minute and other times, that's what the battle on the face of the earth is. The intelligent, the rational. Forget about intelligent, the rational. The anti-religious crowd who realize that, you know, we got to take care of Venice here. And then the superstitious, Hocus, Pocus crowd. Oh, the Lord works in mysterious ways. And Armageddon's coming and Baba Boyan, all the other crab. Man, and people, they need to be locked up right along with that. Rodriguez Guy. WDQAM. Come to Neil. Yes, sir. Oh, hey, I said, didn't call into chime in on your pole. But I would have had that. That's okay. It's probably got to be Rio. Because, um. Or somewhere in Brazil, because the Brazilian women there in Miami are just gorgeous. I'll be damned. Um, but as you're going to say, you know, I'm real worried about the elections coming up with the dive board and these electronic voting. I mean, does everybody see that that is just like the wolf guarding the henhouse? I can't believe that after the debacle of 2000 that the country buys all the way to fix it is with a paperless, you know, totally. Uh, system that you can't track. No paper. Real, right. Well, we had a story on a couple of days ago about the fact that the, uh, the paper was Neil and Roy that they're testing the one. That is, uh, the paper trail with it so that, uh, there, there wouldn't, there wouldn't have been any of these machines that, they just strictly have to take their ward on a counter, no way to trace it. But also, I had read. I think maybe on the article on your website that some of them they can, like, any one with a basic computer understanding can get in their hack with them. And even if they do print out something that says, hey, you voted for Gore, how do we know that it didn't register bush? And that's a, I don't want to be safe. And that is, uh, hop on a plane man. So we, I want to really start a protest or something like, when I go to vote in November, I wanted to say, hey, I don't trust these machines. I want my vote on power. That's counter by hand. Then we go through that same thing we did back in 2000, at least to kill some good time anyway. I will trade off. We protested. What happened to the, uh, protesters there and downtown my amel happened. Yeah. America is lost on the, uh, John, in fact, when you, when you'll know on January the first one, you're placed in American flag with that swastika, then you'll know it's official. Love you, Neil. See you to border, pal. Bye bye. Good luck to us. Hey, speaking of, imagine this. Imagine Todd rec lying in your backyard like look at like a pus, a pus fuel. With blood and pus oozing from every porn is body. Can you imagine that? I love it. Imagine this. Imagine zero closing costs under next mortgage. Zero application fee. Zero credit bureau fee. Zero discounted points. It's the last mortgage. Deliver need the revolutionary only one mortgage from financial group. Now with interest rate, it just 1.95% you heard right. If you have yourself a 200,000 dollar loan, your payments are a pitence. Amir 738 bucks a month. Once you be finance, you're going to new home mortgage from financial group. You'll never pay closing cost again. So what's not to like about that? Call them toll free and find out all about it. At 1-800-940 land. Grab yourself real financing power with low rate mortgage. You can move your next property without any further calls. Any further cost of expense. The only one mortgage from financial group is what we're talking about. Call 1-800-940 land for details.

We're supposed to re-elphyse each one. You a-m. And film and wear all the girls disrolled. There's one thing keeps me going back the lack of their wardrobe. Maybe one will come home with me. Oh, that is what I hope. Oh, I really like the one named joy. A stripper named joy. Oh, I really like some Christmas joy. Sorry that you stepped on the Humphor. They're 1117 at 5.60. They stepped on the Humphor. Yeah. Are they getting all bent out of shape and psychotic here? That dao went a little buff 10 grand for like about 2 seconds. And now it's 99.69. It's up 4.4. And as that is down 60. But again, they keep both. Just like I told Ted David, when he called it last week, Samole Crap playing with a mind to the public. It's the old psychological. And everything is great. And look at all these new jobs people are got for like 5 bucks an hour. See, that's another thing they haven't told you about the kinds of jobs that people are getting. They're still almost 3 million jobs short. We're talking about real jobs. You know what I'm saying? Yes, I know. Real jobs. Real honest to goodness jobs. Not makefully funny. Ballony part time jobs. Jobs during a holiday season jobs. All of these things. Right. Not try to like PN anybody's parade. But keep it in perspective. Because man, oh, man, are they trying to play a psych game on a public? Hey, everything's really great. And there's Alan Greenspan with his briefcase that old fossil. Jesus Christ Almighty. I'm so sick and tired of seeing that piece of crap. Here's a fact that says, The life never been there, but we all must have the best looking people. Seems to me last time we took this. We got the same result. It wasn't that long ago. In fact, I got to call this David and start me to do this. Thu, okay. That's okay. I used to work in downtown. I mean, the only thing to look forward to in the summer with the annual Brazilian invasion. Holy Schmidt from 14 to 40, maybe 50. The women were stunning. 14 to 50. 14. The boys. Yeah. We're not even one. Nothing. Get a respond to that. Why? That petal perve. Ha ha ha ha. Well, some 14 year old girls look 18. See, better check ID. The best was seeing them at the pool of the inner continental hotel. And I see, I don't understand this. You'll have to brief me. Especially when you had an 18 or 19 year old and her M.I.L.F. going topless together. What does that mean? Mom, I'd like to, you know. Oh. Dad, going topless together, which the inner continental used to wink had given its European and South American Glentel outstanding. I never heard that before my life. See, leave it to Josh Diffolison on that. That's from the American Pie movie. Oh, well, no wonder we don't know what it is. Oh, geez, man. Oh, I know. That was a cute movie, but yeah, it was cute. Yeah. Not the kind of movie they have memorable lines for my don't think. Now, speaking of memorable lines, here's something that did a lot of memorable lines. And that's probably why he's dead today. Six years old today. Nice going, Jim. Well, Chris, though, walks in of everything. He made a lot of stuff. What I hear. Walks in. Which? Jim Morrison's voice. Jim Morrison's former bandmates. Hey, Jim. Not good back with it, but everyone. Jim Morrison's former bandmates, Bruno and Candles, a rose in a poem that is great and Paris yesterday. It could be pretty light, my fire singer. I wonder if light my first on his disc, you think? I can't hear about it anymore. It's not on this one. I'm not going to get to you, everyone. Don't do it. And talk to you, girl. Well, what would have been his 60th birthday yesterday? Oh, it's the same. Oh, it's here. We're trying to evoke this spirit of Jim, Robby Krieger, former guitarist for the North, told us he's a fan of Kippie-Ein Polis barriers. Many have white candles and old album covers. Right. It had the hard-mitting singer survived the turn, 60 would have been happy laughing, joking at good man. The other notches, Rayman's director, the Doris keyboardist. I mean, who is so Elvis? I can't ever do that. Do you wonder why he was no Elvis? I give up because he sang real music. Oh. See what I'm saying? Don't I know? I mean, I don't want to do Elvis back, especially if the holidays will probably have to play the Elvis today. But, um, see how all the people they brought readers, they just can't take the orders man. Oh, wait till you hear this. You want to really puke your guts out? Okay. This will make you get down on your hands and knees and do the old bar for Ramma, the old M.I.L.F. You want that sandstorm? No. Man, I'd like to throw up. This is from the, uh, speaking of, you know, I'm just the 5 report. Maybe Miss Pudge and Bob Cuenst are getting together. Oh, God. Yes. The supporters of former C. Bob Cuenst wanted you go on. Just get a real job and stop trying to be an O.J. on provocative. You asshole. Faggot you. You idiot. You simple then. Miss Pudge reports last night. Supporters of former First Lady Harry Rodham Clinton will run cable TV ads urging Democrats to write in her name during the next month's democratic presidential primary. The ads start running today. Time to coincide with the Democratic candidates debate on W.M.U.R. TV. The local ABC affiliate that it may also be televised nationally on C.S.B. Bob Cuenst, the Florida Queen activist behind the writing campaign, said the 30 second ads would run for three days on cable stations in Concord, Manchester and Portsmouth, to Hampshire. God, does he make you want a bar for a while? Told you. Yep. She's not running Cuenst. And here we got Gore endorses Howard Dean today, but here's an, and again, wouldn't you think of all the people? Howard Dean who signed these. Civil Union Bill in Vermont, which was ground breaking at the time, and still is. And this guy wants to write in Hillary. Maybe he likes the way Hillary dresses better. Maybe he appreciates her cancels more than we do. Maybe he wants to borrow her dresses. Maybe he likes to dress. Maybe he can misfog your like dressing up together. Who knows for the holidays? Because what else would misfog your gotten that, except for straight from the horses as. That's them. Oh, God. See, that's one of the things about South Florida, and the same tired old nudnix. They just never go away. At least I need to probably have the decent see to get leave town. Even it wasn't a real, but at least they got around a town. But Bob Cuenst is the same old crap with a bumper stickers, and we're having a meeting by the old oak tree down there in Kendall to try to figure out our strategy for our next meeting. Remember that? Yeah. And then they got pissed off at us because we stop calling, announcing all the goddamn meetings. Well, let's have a meeting and wave the flag and blow a horn and whistle or blow something. I got a column for you that's going to knock your socks off. Great. By Fred Grimmant today's Miami Herald. It's a cold day in Rio de Janeiro. Actually, it is cold in the Rio part of the day. Isn't it winter in the summer? Right. The seasons are as backward. Just like them in a women. They're kind of like got their as backward. A boy they're hot. They're hot. Fred Grimm, Terry Shivow, is sustained only by politics. Man, this is one of the best columns that Fred Grimm is ever written. Nice going Fred. Everyone's in a while. He's pretty good. Right? Right? He's not like Mayo. Thank God. A wretched come like once every two years. Sorry Mike. Oh, my son vacation anyway. Like I said, the lift of my ass. He says, all the political grandstanding hasn't changed the gruesome truth. There's no hope for Terry Shivow. Her new court-appointed guardian, Adlydem, spent a month studying her medical records and court documents. He talked to nurses and doctors. He questioned medical legal and bioethical experts. And religious scholars. He talked to family members. He spent time nearly every day at the bedside of the depleted woman at the center of Florida's right to die controversy. He found nothing in her perpetual mindless response that offered hope. Guardian J. Wilson reported this week that highly competent scientifically-based physicians using recognized measures and standards have deduced with a high degree of medical certainty that Terry is in a persistent vegetative state. She has no intellectual capacity. No hope or recovery. No logical test and brain scans will soon notes indicate that Terry's cerebral cortex is principally liquid, paving shrunk. Due to the severe anorexic trauma experience 13 years ago. On February 25, 1990 Terry suffered a heart attack. A loss of oxygen to a brain cause they permit loss of cognitive function after 70 years of failed efforts to revive his wife, her husband Michael surrendered to the inevitable. And it took him more than three years to accommodate this reality. He was beginning to accept the idea of allowing Terry to die naturally, rather than remain in the non-cognitive vegetative state Wilson wrote in his report to the governor. But that decision, which the husband said follows his wife's wishes, set off a bitter feud and court fight with Terry's parents and siblings. They've been absolutely opposed to any decision to disconnect the feeding tube. The Guardian noted that during the years long struggle with these shinlers, a voice that asturbing believed that they would keep Terry alive at any and all costs, even if that required amputation of her limbs or open heart surgery. As part of the hypothetical presented, Schindler family member stated that even if Terry had told him a hypertension to have, artificial nutrition withdraw they would not do it. The feeding tube was finally removed in October, but the legislature urged on by the governor and religious fundamentalists, Interveying the tube was reinserted. A Guardian was appointed a representary, but Wilson's investigation offered no hope. The University of South Florida Professor tried to listen to some response from Terry or her, himself, he spent time with their parents who similarly tried to infiltrate awareness in their daughter nothing happened. Wilson's report only mirrored the finding of so many judges who would consider this awful case for years, he had discovered nothing new. Of course, the governor before leaping into this painful familial fight easily could have read the same records, the legislators before passing such controversial legislation could have first considered opinions of the same experts, scientific testimony would have led them to the same set, inscapable conclusion that Terry Chival was beyond hope, but scientific reality didn't matter. The governor and legislators were indulging in anti-science, like medieval potentates, hauling Terry into a political form to appease their ignorant zealots. Wilson gently suggested that the governor in the warring factions agreed to a compromise, if Terry can eat and drink or swallow on a road than she'd be sustained, otherwise the tube would be disconnected. She'd be allowed to die, too late I'm afraid to die with dignity. Of course, the governor won't agree, he and his dark age allies already know that Terry Chival can't eat or drink or swallow on a road. They know that she's beyond medical, healthy, only thing sustaining her depleted life is a gruesome intrusive, very medieval kind of politics. What a great con of my Fred Graham today's Miami hero man, he deserves a peel of surprise. That was good, something. When that good, right on target and Valze to say it, the governor and his religious fanaticist fundamentalist allies, just playing politics with this emotional situation, as always, another goddamn bush. 27-pash 11, that's what Harry wanted. Just before he croaked, Harry carried another goddamn bush. So that's what he wrote. 10-sealinitary. If we want to welcome a new sponsor out of New Rogers show, it's EF Tower and Audra Repair.

You know that the euro is like, I don't really want to look at it today. Over 122. You know what it was about a year and a half ago. 92 cents. And now it's $122 against the dollar. The Canadian dollar, or a year and a half or with 62 cents, now it's 77 plus. So enough to make you gag. But anyway. I even says, I was listening to your program yesterday. My way back from an interview when I heard you ask about Puerto Rican delicacies. Having been there so many times, here are some for Pudge. Just as we send Pudge Packing. So instead of sending him, I have a packet of a sandwich. We'll pack him a Mofongo. Hey Mofongo Pudge. Ivan, look at this. How do you like that? Yeah, Ivan, that's Ivan. See, as an Ivan Pudge Rodriguez. See. I'll be damned. Mofongo is like a Boston post on. It was like a big toast on it. A mashed green plantains that have been fried and shaped in large container. Maybe filled with meat shrimp, creole or lobster creole. Normally served in the container that resembles a mortar. Wow, I'm mortified here in that. Aren't you? Come on. Pastels, very similar to Tomali's, but made of mashed green plantains, and has some kind of meat. I eat chicken, pork, etc., or human remains in a creole sauce. And the entire mass is wrapped in a banana leaf and then placed in a hot water until the cooked. What is nothing like human excrement in a creole sauce? See, that's what they do is they do anything they put in. They take a flame around, just so that it's in a creole sauce. It's good for you. Al Caputias. It's a fritter made of mashed green plantains that have been a, if filling like meat or seafood. A fritter. You know, I haven't had a corn fritter in about 100 years. Neither. That's good. Hush puppies. Where did you, we used to get corn fritters? Like into fear? Okay. That's one kind of thing. That's one kind of thing. Like in corn fritters. They've even two of us in school.

I don't even want to read this. Where were you? This was about to tape and all this other stuff. He was covering his ass back in February when he started making rumblings. He was a man that the shipment was going to hit the fan. Cash my drift. I caught it. In fact, Howard Stern said the shipment already hit the fan. It's on an morning between six and nine or ten. Myderly goes off. Anyway, more on this social workers want to interview Michael Jackson's children. But it's been stymied each time they visited Neverland Ranch. Sources told New York Post yesterday.

The Boston Globe this morning for thousands of city workers and retirees under Recoss saving proposal mayor Thomas Minio is announcing today. The pilot program outlined in remarks scheduled to be delivered to the city council hearing were probably saved a shave about a million dollars a year off the city 61 million dollar prescription drug bill according to city estimates. The savings are expected to be relatively small at first because the program would be voluntary and cover a limited selection of medicines like oxycontin maybe. Minino asserts in his comments, which were obtained by the globe that importing medications is safe. Although the federal food and drug administration is repeatedly cautioned, it can ensure the safety of drugs brought in from Canada and importation remains illegal. It can ensure the safety of drugs brought in from Canada because this is a tenth world country because the American air is dangerous and my kid, if he had a McDonald's here, got to know his what kind of meat they're using. God, what? So sad. It's so sad. They want everybody in America to continue to be like a five year old kid in the sandbox with his little pale and shovel and believe me, they keep giving you a play the shovel in there. And smell it. So that's good Boston is like standing up to him. Excellent. Prop 27 at 5.50 WQM. Happy birthday. I guess I'll play it again to my good buddy Shelley Bloom tonight. Yes, right.

And investors any ill. Just because misery loves company. And it pushes a piece of crap. But anyway, it's like a. Up like two and a half points and slide back. Then as next down 14 and a half. So when he put that headline on their website. Yeah, it did cross like temporarily for like a millisecond. And then all of a sudden. Right back down. They don't want to get a little bit too carried away. Because everybody's working and speaking of that. I got a great story on our website today on your rangers.com. That you all should read. It's too long. We don't need all the George of E.D. Press that I want too long. Oh. Wallmarks big squeeze play by Harley Sourenson. Starts off by saying question when is big too big answer when it's Walmart. Yeah, that. I just read a couple of programs to what you're whistle our ending. We did on the website. What it. She says about 50 years ago when I lived in Seattle and worked at Bowling. I stumbled one day upon a Luther League form. Dating this question is if possible to succeed in business using Christian ethics. We didn't have rabbit liberals and rabbit conservatives in those days of release. Not many of them. So most of the people involved in the form were we now call middle the road. The conclusion they reach at the end of the hour was a willful. No. Nobody wanted to admit that the golden rule was not a good business rule but facts is facts and the form was an honest one which brings us to Walmart. To the best of my knowledge, Sam Walton didn't break any laws built against fantastic Walmart empire and his low price philosophy. Certain helped a lot of people. But Walton's success was ruthlessly created on the backs of fragile human beings. A good many of whom are worse off of the experience. So on balance is Walmart more good than bad or more bad than good. And you can guess for yourself what the conclusion of this article is. And it goes on and on a fairly great life. It's on our website and yourriders.com along with a lot of other good stuff that you should be reading. And not enough people are. See what we we I think what we need to do is like take out a maybe I'll pay for it a full page ad in the US today or something like that. Yeah. And just promote our website. Okay. And then a lot of people could like listen to the show online. Right right. But most importantly they could find one spot. I mean I'm not saying that they can't find all these stories someplace else because Nicholas to say what a fast news resource is a few way in. Wishers are dig at these things up on our own. But it's just to me it's like like a godson you know from the prices right and it saves you a lot of time from reading. Sifting through like hundreds and hundreds of newspapers. And you know why a thousand of websites here a day right right I think we're doing it and you don't get ink on your fingers that's correct. Sometimes you get stink on your finger but that's when you're bad boy or good five six seven oh five 60 well that's what's go and said. How's that book to one one in the pink and one in the stink I'm just thinking about writing it she's getting so much feedback from that. Yes you really yeah almost as good as my best of meals book. How I attacked the buffet. And that's what I'm saying on a day when we started out with at the Gornouncement. Just for the Saudis. You think that the audience to be all pumped up and forming it to my turn out to busy shopping. They can't be bothered with us line one is working again is it ringing? No no or yet is now.

That's great stuff. You're not even I'm not a dolphin fan I assume. No no no. What do you like? I like the jet. The jet's well. Okay. Nothing's perfect but I will say this because I think we're late. The next best thing that the jet's winning in your case would be the dolphins losing. There you go. Have a great day pal. Thank you. And you got it. Yeah don't let me forget to play that. Don't forget the times you know what else I got to play again. I wish I'd be playing it every hour on the hour. You show you. That the Mickey Mouse thing. And Remus. Remus is my favorite Mickey's okay but Remus is just he's just as some special. He's the bomb digity. He'd be the bomb. He'd a man. Speak on a heat of man. Stunt woman to suit Schwarzenegger. Arnold we just heard about what is the stunt penis. Arnold Schwarzenegger is being sued by a woman who claims he launched a dirty Turks campaign against run the eve of his election as California governor emerged today. Start woman Ron DeMiller was one of a number of women who claimed to have been groped by the actor turned politician. But the day before California went to the polls. Schwarzenegger's office allegedly issued an advisory to the media. Detailing information about a convicted criminal called Ron DeMiller. With an hours Miss Miller was branded a criminal on news programs. Only days after the election with Schwarzenegger very touristed it emerged. That Miss Miller had no criminal record. The information alluded to by the Schwarzenegger campaign team and carried on by law enforcement. I carried on a law enforcement website. Was about a different woman with the same name. How do you like that? Must have been just an accident. Don't you think? I'm sure. Gloria Allrad, the anxious Gloria Allrad, a California attorney who appeared alongside Miss Miller once she made her groping claims. Was holding her press conference today to announce the lawsuit. At the briefing she'll announce a file. I wonder if it's an accident. She'll announce a filing of libel lawsuit against Governor Schwarzenegger and his campaign committee office. It's only 930 out there. She said to stay in on October 6, 2003 Miss Miller held a news conference with Miss Allrad, which Miss Miller was achieved. She had been sexually harassed by Mr. Schwarzenegger. Once he worked as a stunt woman in the movie with him. Shortly after the news conference today, the Schwarzenegger campaign sent email to report as which appeared to suggest that Miss Miller was a convicted felon. Always attacked the bitch. Always attacked the victim. Whether it's Kobe, whether it's anybody. Right? Works like a charm. Always attacked the victim. Just like your Robert Blake, your buddy there. Hmm. She had it coming. Just like O.J. The bitch had it coming. The truth was however that the Ron Demeter who held the news conference with Miss Allrad had never been arrested for anything in her life. The false information about Miss Allrad, who was broadcast on National Television, no comment was immediately available from Schwarzenegger. He's still looking for the, he's looking for the groper. The ifurren growth. They grow in fear. He's still looking for him. I guess he didn't shave today. Just look at the mirror, Arnold. I mean, what kind of crap in the news media they've reported with a straight face after after the election is over and he's going to conduct his own investigation. Right. What does that mean? Is he going to like subject himself to truth serum or something like that? Means shut up. What comes up? The lighting, tector. Did I really grow them or not? I was engaged in some rowdy behavior. I just said to movies. Let me tell you right now boys and girls that was today. If you were any doubts that was the day to final nail went in the American coffin. 48% of California in such a liberal supposed state broad minded progressive thinking and breathing just because they wanted to say goodbye to a great Davis. And so the act of man who is just unbelievably, functionally illiterate. He sounds like he just got off the guy to him banana boat. The brought worst boat. Man, how long has he been here? How many years? I've heard of me. He still can't speak for the crap. 1240, 20 till one. What that makes me want to play? I give up. Why haven't played it a long time? Not playing it now. John, where are the tracks? Carl, see? Makes me want to inspire me. Well, get them all in. It's a good time for the great taste. Speaking of that, how about a segue for balance for life?

So, all of they don't see anything but looks. Nope. Where are the dolphins mugs? Who the hell is it? You don't need our dolphins noίers and the making you need a video, but it's empty. More than a dozen allegations of harassment and grouping surfaced against the movie Star-Turne politician in the last days of the recall campaign, prompting Schwarzenegger to announce that he had sometimes behaved badly on Routy movie sets, he apologized to what he might have offended, a mere culpage communications director read away the yesterday. The governor after consulting with legal counsel and advisors has determined that investigation will be rather pointless given the political nature this has taken on said Rob Stuttman, Schwarzenegger's communications director. The early district attorney's office said it has no investigation and no complainer which to act and so the governor's concluded as we believe most Californians have it's simply time to move on so it can focus entirely on the job Californian sent here to do. He remains sincere in his apology to anyone he's offended. Right, that's what Ted Vonie would have said if he had the chance. Right? The whole of the hall of jies. Let's move on to what John Tito. In fact, I think that's what's his latest Rodriguez guy's going to say to a time to move on. I apologize and let's move on and who's got the burritos. Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who's heard Schwarzenegger to hire a firm to investigate the claims had no comment yesterday, his press set his press secretary Halley Jordan, no King Halley Burry. I forgot that Halley Burry had that nasty merits that they've just us. That he ended in a real bitter nasty hostile miserable divorce in her thinking about committing suicide. You know that? Nope. Yeah. Warrior Garg, Gloria Alred, who represents a woman who, and you notice one thing about that, they're both exactly the same complexion because she's got a white mother and a dark complexion father. And he said something about your mama, they've just us. Gloria Alred, who represents well, that's the same story. Urged the woman to sue Schwarzenegger, said the governor's decision would not surprising, but it's insufficient, insufficient. The issue was not going to go away any attempt to cover it up or run from it's going to be seen for exactly what it is. She said he needs to be accountable. All right, a democratic activist who donated the former governor of Grey Davis's campaign suggested that Schwarzenegger should set an example by holding a public forum so women could air their grievances. The governor's about face make me a perception problem for his pledging administration said Joe Surrell, a federal and democratic consultant. A lot of people will just laugh because they didn't think it was going to happen to begin with. This is underscoring what people anticipated, right? I'm so happy. Work right. Say we knew it. I mean, how any honor give you got to be? Well, I'll investigate it after you'd like the whole idea of the allegations where to prove how unfitty was to be the governor or to scumbag he is, but he's going to investigate his own actions after he gets in there. And the public said, yeah, sure. Man, talk about stupid, stupid, idiotic jerks. Foreign to wrong business. Oh, we ought to be selling snake or a lot there in a highway. Make a fortune.

no difference 84 21 poem on percent I don't care you know and those 21 percent aren't for Dean anyway you see right I don't care I'm for Bush who certainly aren't for Dean 66 16 and a half percent just a little tad below what it usually is in his crowd and of course that's because rush is probably on right now you think yeah if guarantees that nomination for Dean it's so is it I've lots of that puts in the old lockbox as I would say 50, and actually hurt Dean 23, 5.7 percent of the very confused public out there in video land it'll hurt him right oh line nine's ringing again don't you love

is not going to be to run a bush he's got you know he's got the job at NBC 60 doesn't need the radio gig all the were static to have him back trust me but the fact that it matters he just doesn't be to run a bush he'll tell it like it is if he hates somebody he'll tell you and he hates you like poison mo he don't want to do with it I want to see you the beast already reported that the it's his icy is the north pole in there and the eight o'clock could turn over in the morning when he's going out and Joe is coming in said it was actually like frost on the windows it might be 85 on the outside but it's like 20 below zero on the inside it's bad there's a chill in the year you know what I mean that's a looted yeah he hates him a mo and mo didn't show mo was an oh show for the christmas party last night and just like the ratings party you know why at least I'll give him credit for that he understands that everybody in the building hates him like poison that's a looted why would you show up for a gathering for a festive event when you know that nobody there's going to be your friend it's always going to be a bunch of people around you who hate you who are saying horrible things about you and your hair piece and your checkered pants and your colostomy bag and all the other good stuff right he showed up last year yeah but but he's a little slow on the uptake you out of here once it by then and at that time he was only blaming you and I that's right it was you and me right it was only us now of course and of course it must be part my must be all of our fault that we talked everybody else into it right oh I don't think so you know last year he showed up with the his fancy piece anyone from table to table greeting hand shaking but avoided our little uh quarter table you know gave it a wide birth was that just because he tried to get your ass fired is that it not coincidence that and because anybody else associated with you must be one of the evil doers that must be yeah no question guess what we hate to like poison mom and your show sucks too might look all this is five 60 you I was a gin-horpey's pants. That hikes moko ran on soak-up-sized cube-woot-bitten. And gage in a paper-let-day. Oh, the home home? I am a crazy home-a-full. Not that I mind it, but I'm way too old. I fantasize about being in bed. It attrists with feet-loom-made man-friend in a day. I'll just make up with generous some days. And then ask them to break my bun. Now there are no ver again. So I would not deal with more spools. No! And I would not be ashamed. About a ginger and more gay union. Just bold and instructing away. Boy, mate, tell me you're not my type. I just sound like a nine-year-old kid. Aaaaah! Only a macho men-ly guy. We don't know. That makes me flip my wig. If ginger was a lover of mine, I'd bury my bull-dispany-no. Inside is simply re-written. That did it it did it. No, I would not be a sport-owned girl. If I was not a closet of faith, That's why a ginger and more gay union would make me feel good today. Everybody follow my thousand-pool. Yeah, ginger and more gay union. Would make my sorrow-boony-ass feel safe. If we had a ginger and more gay union, That would have to cut me raped. Absolutely. 155 at 5.60 WQAM. And a mad dog is sitting by. He'll be along next. Licking his wounds from Sunday. And again, too. A George Wastro, apologize. I apologize. Before correcting me, I make an off-logitment of a state semi-automatic creating one for me. Okay. I make many mistakes. Usually one of them is sitting my ass down here at 7.30 in a morning. But Oregon voted for Gore. Not for Bush. Not for a quarter of the map I had. Well, I don't care what the map says. I'm reading it right here from CNN. And they don't make mistakes, Mr. Democrat wins. And I got the list right here. Okay. Oregon's 7-lectoral votes. Are you looking at the right it is the map? Let me get that guy at it. Oregon is like right south of Washington, Staggy, you are right. Yeah. It's just between California and I beg your pardon. Oh, look at that. Yeah. I got the right. No, no, no. Because when you put the mouse over it, it gives you the breakdown. Yeah. But it's colored and red. And then you go, huh? When you put the mouse over it, this box pops up and it says, Gore is 719-165. And boy, 712-705. Pretty close. 7,000 votes. 47% to 47%. But nevertheless, they've got it colored wrong on this map here. Colour me wrong. How do you do that? Who's website is that? ABC. What an idea. If you only call back on that horrible day on that. We call 2001. If you only call the president. Uh, but sure which we had then. But anyway, if you remember, I'm at the ABC was hyper-vibrating. Peter Jennings was on there who really blows. And we're made a shame that he's Canadian. Mike Myers of Canadian. There you go. But talking about how there was another plane, high-jet and Seattle. Right. Was a rumor. And of course it turned out not to be too thin. Correct. I mean, we had more than enough. But they, they were just all over the place. And so finally, we put on what did I put on the year on MSNBC? I see an, no, I think we put on MSNBC because they wanted us, uh, of course, in the stage to put on channel 10, which is ABC, because we had that working agreement with them. And what does that know about stuff like that? We like that. No, we like Todd's tongue. That's what the right lot of them. He enjoys Todd's tongue, especially on his back. I've never less. So, what am I trying to say? Oh, ABC don't try to pull a crap. No, I do recall. So you look at their map. Now CNN, which I grant you is just horrible as far as on the year. But at least on their website, they have some pretty interesting stuff. Although they didn't have earlier, thou hits 10,000. Or they know they had thou passes 10,000. Is it past 10,000 right now? I mean, does they want to keep changing their recovery couple of minutes, which they don't usually do? The thou is 99.74. What's up? 8.81. NANDEC is down 16, almost 17 points. 1932, which is good year for FDR. But other than that, see what I'm saying? That's my drip. So I have figured out how our dean can win the election. By running? That would help. And by getting chorus in Dorisville, which helped in all the unions. But no, I'm serious and talking about the electoral votes. Why don't we get over this thing with the electoral college man? Never. Jesus. I know right. I know when when it starts benefiting the Democratic party. Oh, then that's what we'll say on the other hand. Our majority is the Democratic party. And I've got to call it a couple of days ago. It's always that same old crap. Oh, yeah, we need a Democratic president and Republican Congress. Right. So that we can have this gigantic unbelievable pork field budget. They passed yesterday. Number one. And number two, so that every right wing piece of legislation can get muscle through there. Okay. And they'll have more than enough people to override a presidential veto by any Democrat. Right. That makes a lot of sense. No. Florida. I mean, we're actually one it. So do you need to do that? I'm not saying needs to have been all of these because he can actually lose like I or maybe Illinois, maybe both New Hampshire. He's going to win. He's going to sweep all in the wing with Cleveland. Yeah. Nevada. Go in Nevada. Tennessee, where Al Gore lost his home state. Tennessee could as a possibility. The only state I see in the South besides Florida. And West Virginia, which frequently does go to Democratic. Okay. If he goes in there and pays off enough people and often I'm cold people, you see what I'm saying? Right. Those cold people in West Virginia. Absolutely. I dog who's pretty cold from his trip to Illinois when on Sunday is going to rehash and there are re-examine and I'll tell you what. The boy to the Patriot sure have been lucky. Bye. Bye. You just pound it silly and then whatever comes out, eat it.
