Have a lovely day. Nio, I hope you have a great dance. Well, we have a... Don't go running out of here without telling the truth. Don't tell me I'll put you in the truth. I know, okay. I'm looking at people I know to wish out of the last minute. How many people did you tell me off here where really at that ballgame is today? I want to number 3000. Okay. And, uh, Skippy's mad at me because he didn't see me covered in boobs the other night at Sin City. Yeah. I was covered in boobs, deal. You know the pressure I'm under. Now all the religious groups are after me. What a thought that is. I'm moving in with a Jews, a Jews, a mad. I think Skippy likes to squeeze your boobs as a matter of fact that's what he told me. I love screw your name and the sheriff used a broom handle on him. That's when it's your position. He just can yell at me. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, don't. Dig him out. Dig him out. Okay. The loy-nine thing's got to have a lasi-day meal. I don't think you know what? This place without you is I got to know water in your toilet. See the Marlon game. When you leave Miami dude, every... Clarence is pacing and speaking in tongues. What does Ryanus say is the place is full of crap. Is that what you're saying? That's just falling apart without you. It's like having... It's like you go home to a surprise party and all the loons of our depots. Hey, if you're on the end of the bus this morning folks, but he's still okay in my bus. See ya. See ya. View. Yaaaaaah. Uh-uh. Hello? Guess who? Hello. Guess who? Well, add some in. You just cost me $6,000. What? $6,000. Really? Yes. What can I do for you? What time do you have? It's 12.22. That's right. Wait. What am I going to do this month? Go away, sis. My name is Richard Roma. What can I do for you? You just cost me $6,000. I cost you $6. Yes. Now, where were you last night? Where was I supposed to be? You got the wrong number. What a big manual! Hey, let me buy your pack of gum. I should have a chew it. Ooh. What do you shit me? Fuck you. Yeah, that's what you got to try. So I could crack your fucking head. How f*** are you? Yeah. Come down. I straightened you out. Where the f*** are you? Hello. Where was I? I was at home. Oh, wait. Where did you run your trade? You stupid f***ing f***ing f***ing idiot. Look, I got to go before I get really mad and then I f***ing hunt you down. You f***ing f***ing quit. You f***ing, I'm so sorry. I find out who f***ing cousin you are. I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your hat. Fuck you. Are you really, you? Oh my god. I'm sorry. I tell you why. Fuck my job. I quit. Come down, step. Fuck you. Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah. Tough on the phone. Oh, everybody. My wife tough on the phone, too. What are you good about it? I tell you where I'm going to do it. I tell you where I'm going to do it. Don't hurt about it, my dupa. You were saying. I don't know who the f***ing you are. You're f***ing you are. You're in for big surprise. I tell you that, right. That's right. Because you don't know me. You f***ing you. You f***ing. Yeah, I know. You're fairing. I give you a favor. You should probably f***ing... You f***ing cuck sucker. Oh, man. I wish we'd owe the trouble in my life. I would like to beat you face. You know that. You f***ing you. Let me feel so good. Yeah, I know. Goodbye. You f***ing run somebody. That was special. Absolutely. It really was. Anyway, it's 10.05. It's 5.06. For Ralph Drooming out of the bus this morning. I heard him. I don't care what Neil Rogers says. We got a real big thing going with a barlange. And I don't care what Neil says. About the people. And you do the why, Kier. Just the way it is, man. You know, and I'm used to it. I'm used to being blamed. I could blame for everything else. We used to have those t-shirts as it's Neil's fault. And then on the back, you know, if it rains, if your dog takes a crap on a carpet, it's Neil's fault. I'm used to it. I can handle it. That broad shoulders. And so if anybody doesn't go to a ball game or any other sporting event, it must be my fault. I'll take full blame for it. Full blame. Okay. So you're a mean man. That's what Chickas said. Yes, I am. I'm proud to say it. We got the cock couple's contest number three is over. As of this moment, I just declared it's over. 411 votes is what I got. That would you got. Oh, maybe go back there now. No, don't go back. I just got. Well, that's when I closed it out, right? It's in a clock. And we'll go from bottom to top. And last place with 40 votes, Jody and Kevin, it's that Cp thing. And what the other guy said was. I call it way in last place. Sorry, guys. But thanks, everybody who said the pictures and the participated. Okay. Thank you very much. And we got another one coming up next month, which will mostly be on your skinny shoulders. Yeah. Rich and Cheryl 72 in Sputtershirl's gigantic impressive chest. Dan and Sherry 79. Captain Singin' his wife, 164. We might have voted for Captain Singin' but not in the 30 magazines last two months. Vicky and Mick 172. Dan and Michelle, 220. They moved up nicely, but not really contending. Ian and Jen, 282. Mike and Christian, 300. I think they deserve a little more than that, don't you? Yes. Holly and Darren did well. They had 344. They came in fifth, fourth. What did they come in? Fourth. Fifth. And then I'm really surprised that this couple didn't do a little bit better. Mary and Shane, they did well, 353, especially considering Mary's smiling abreast. They're, I mean, gigantic smiling hooters, but, and they, well, wait a minute. Didn't they come in third? No fourth. So they get nothing but our best wishes. Third, winning dinner at the pizza loft, Greg and Stephanie 487. And is that something they can come on a motorcycle? Right. Not everybody can do that. Oh, seriously, the Suzuki is in a picture. See, they're all dressed up in a bike outfit. Four free meals. He does look a little like Charlie Manson. So nice going guys. They came in third to get the dinner for two to pizza loft. Second place. Brian and Natasha pulled it out. And Miguel was saying that if they would have shown the other picture in the Tasha would have had the breast show in there that would probably could have given him a run for the money to our winners. Although I see she's wearing a top. Well, maybe she had like a little surprise in it. Maybe she had like openings. Oh, that we grind in. Brian and Sasha 510. They get second place. So now that was they get either the trick, whatever the first place doubled in one, which is a bad way to put it. Isn't it? No, because the first place doubled and it gets the three day two night stay for two with the world. Or races, we saw him casino into Bahamas with round trip air for our like your air or. Or three night two day stay and that is correct. By the way, three night two day stay at for two. He'd nism two or three in Jamaica, including transfers food, Groud drink, or two days entertainment nowhere. So they are winning couple gets to pick whatever they want. And the second place couple, which is a Brian and what's your name? What's your name? Stephanie. And Natasha, they get whatever is left over, which is not bad. And the winning couple, just smashing the competition, Frank and Liz, a thousand and 68 vote. Shocking, which means that they have a lot of friends and a lot of our freepers. And they did very nicely. Congratulations guys. And Miguel, I'm sure it'll be probably not only calling, let them know, but probably wanting to go along. Yes, sir, what happened? But you just kick his ass out of it. He's just your brutal. He just broke him out this morning. Yeah, bad. That's really hard. Why do I Carlos was in jail over the weekend? Oh, that's here. See, the audience thinks we're making us up about this kid that we got. We just can't get his life straight enough. No, you see you're laughing. I'm crying. I'm not a virgin. It takes a lot to get me to cry, but he's got me right on the edge. And we want right now on behalf of Little Beiner Roy, we want to apologize to the audience. We have a very loyal bunch of people over there. I'd like to try to find out what's going on in our website. I'd use to be very prestigious website until this weekend. But unfortunately, Carlos was otherwise detained. And I think detained is the operative ward in this case. Little REC up there on a highway. And he's got one story and the other person got the other story. And then, of course, he just happened to be driving without a license without a foul of drivers license and created a little bit of a problem for himself. So the bedtime stories didn't get on our Saturday. The ones that I worked feverishly to send him, think it out there Sunday because he was otherwise detained. And who knows what's going to happen today? We did set him along a bunch of really good stuff. Didn't even get the great Steven story on there from Saturday, which I have right here, thank goodness. Maybe it was my psychic abilities again. Maybe I had a foresight to realize that I should bring that up here with me. Because he probably would screw up again. The man just can't he is light. What do I tell you? Life challenged. Life is a challenge for being a boy. He can't, it's not just the keys. It's not just, you know, can't find his ass with both hands. It's just everything in his life is a major crisis. Do you think he's listening right now? Yes. Well, good. We like him a lot. Okay. He's does a great job on the website. But he's like backing himself in a way in an extracable position. Do you know what I mean? No. What do you mean? Kind of like when the beast gets down on all fours and clearance makes up in behind him. And it's like an extracable one. And especially for the beast once he gets down on all fours, it's going to take months before he gets back up again. He needs to find something vertical to climb up on. Back to him. Yeah. So, for else, I'll also tell me he's going to work feverishly on getting clearance laid. But I doubt it. And the interesting part of it is I think you may have been right. I don't want to say what you were saying on Friday because I thought that was really you in very poor taste. God. I don't want to say it. You said you were the one making all kinds of implicated. Hey, how I was next you're going to be doing to him the same thing with Tom Jitter times I did to Craig Stevens the paper boy. How's he doing? Oh, we're fine. Yeah. Tom, once again, full of crap. Don't have your facts straight. But thanks for mentioning me in the newspaper again. Look at to that. It's going to be a brutal week. See, this is usually the week that I'm gone. I start that summer gig this week, the 20th of June. And somehow I screwed up this week, this year. Because I know the audience had much rather have you talked about the Michelle Gillon's ass. Oh, and for Michelle Gillon and right, Laura Dale's mustache. But, you know, I'll do it best I can. And I will read another sentence from Hillary Clinton's book. Let's hear it now that I'm back here in a real civilized place. I'll read one more sentence. This is the only place in the world where you'll hear the Hillary book read on a radio one sentence at a time. Should I do that right now? Okay. Let's get it over there. Let's get on the way. I'm going to do it with the pull from the weekend again. We got to deal with the new pull, which we're going to be building maybe, but I doubt it. Here you go. Listen carefully. I came of age on the crest of tumultuous social change and took part in the political battle spot over the meaning of America and its role in the world. All right. Nice one. That's it. Now the sentence tomorrow. See, it gives you a chance to like absorb it better. One sentence at a time. Very slowly. Very carefully. So what are you going to be buying? Hillary book or Harry Potter or both? You know, I'll probably have to wind up spending money on that Harry Potter book as I have a teen child that reads that. Twelve minutes after 10 I want to mention before you forget that Bob Eisenhardtberg is a major asshole, but that aside. That aside. That aside. Now with Tom Corley on these said, that aside.

My life and love all this is for 3856. You are a fan. You approach a beautiful woman's car. You will not let you ask because she has a snob. Get out of here you dog. The snob. Look I told you I don't want you near me, okay? I told you I don't want my weird shield clean. I don't need my car clean. I don't need anything but I want you to ask. Because let me tell you something. I know you trying to pick me up. I know it. I know it for a fact. 1070 that 560 WQM happy Monday to avoid this sunny and smoking here. It's like about 90. It is smoldering. I got a smog alert already but it's not humid like there. It's not like suffocating. So now let me just see if my psychic powers are working. This call online 9 that says Miami. I bet you know who it is. Okay. WQM hello. Hey, no good morning. Is this you? No. Not the chronic? No. Are you black? Yes. It's you. See I told you. I know who that is. That's a guy that got close 8 million times today. I'm not on Friday. Just bitched him out on Friday. I said get out of here. He's the one that's fastened under two different names. Calls online 9 which have no idea why. Since, you know, he's got all the other lines you could call on. It's kind of like holding up a banner saying, hey, I'm the chronic asshole. I'll be online 9. What do I tell ya? Do I know my crap or what? You got it. I know my crap. And you know something? I don't know my crap as well as I thought I did because the pool I was going to take. Tell Eric to put that one on the back burner. I mean, it's not a bad pool, but I got a much better one. It used to stack me from a listener. But she liked this one much better. Oh, yeah. Especially on the heels of that tacky Johnson business. And he's got my pick right up front and center. Really? Okay. So here's the pool for today. Oh, I better do the other one. I'm so enthused that somebody asked, well, let me just tell you something. Okay. You know, as well as I do, especially since you're so bad on polls anyway. Yeah. Come out on something new and exciting and interesting and different pool every day. Just try to do because we used to take some pride in our website until Carlos got busted over the weekend. But up until that point, we used to take a lot of pride in. But to come up with something new and different every day is like, just mind boggling. Mind boggling. Or you know what I was thinking about during the break? I give up. I was thinking about the fact that Miguel, see, it's kind of like one of those damned if you do and damned if you don't. On the one hand, we know he's not too crazy about sitting in there and answering the calls and screener. But on the other hand, it keeps him away from Doreen back there and promotions. It's a mixed blessing. So it's a mixed bag. A mixed bag. And I was wondering to myself, if the re like ever has like put her hands on Miguel, you know what I mean? You follow what I'm saying? Because we know she wants him desperately and he's very angry. No, I don't want to hear that. That's a cop. We don't play that game anymore. I wouldn't hear that question. I bring your part. He could. He could. He could. But he won't. Did you got something in his mouth? His tongue. Yeah. He's biting it and there's blood dripping out his chin. Yeah, there's something dripping out his chin. I'm sure that. Well, okay. He won't answer the question. But I guarantee you she's probably grabbing a cheek here in there and you know like Panna nice job. Miguel, good job out there today in the event. You know, she talks a little bit like she talks a little bit like for a while. This morning, I thought you had a bunch of boogers on your nose. But anyway, so on a pull from a Friday, 1834 votes. Which of these are you most sick and tired of hearing about? We asked. Now see, the first category I'm assuming. I'm probably sprained a little bit better. Although it did very well anyway in one by a landslide. I'm assuming the reality TV shows includes all of these star wannabes, you know little boy and Girl stars and teenage star. You know what? Where they call those idols. Yeah, all of those. Yeah, I'm sure that's what we're talking about. Are you saying? Uh-huh. Am I right? Absolutely. Okay. Reality TV shows 3. 39. 389. I mean, winning hands down. Scot and Lacey Peterson 230. Nice job. I'm Eric correcting my bad spelling. Thank you. About time you did something. The Hillary book 203. Weapons. We better not piss off Eric now. It's in limbo status of Carlos, you know what? We better start sucking up the Eric big time. Because if we if we lose the old man, I mean, if we lose Carlos. Hillary book 203. Weapons of mass destruction 195. New Harry Potter book 170. Oh my god, they're selling that thing like it was head like an at a hundred dollar Bill inside of a book. Right. Have you ever seen anything like that? No. I mean, look, on a one hand, that note on several hands. First of all, if kids are reading, even if it is crap, at least it keeps him off the streets. And number two, it's good for commerce. It's good for the economy. Somebody's buying something, right? Okay. I'm trying to look on the bright side. Oh, the Martha Stewart. Martha Stewart 147. The Middle East Road map. 142. It's a little rocky. I guess they missed all those mines in the middle of the road, all those landbines. Then they give a little shot at me here, although it's very close. Neal's movie shows 119, 6.4% how hot Jackie Johnson the channel seven weather Babies 116. So like three votes spread there. The Florida Marlins only 58. They love those Marlins. They just too cheap to go see him. How about that Don Trell again there, I'm a girl? Good stuff. Good stuff. Another shot out, even though it was a rain shorten game. The kid is a dynamite nobody cares. If 15,000 announced, which means Saturday, maybe it was like 10 or 12. I'm ready proud of for a little butchered up in the admitting, well I'd back him into a corner. Admitting on the ear there a few minutes ago that there was only 3,000 people there yesterday. Maybe nobody saw them throughout the first pitch. Yeah, and that's what he's pissed off about. He don't care if you support the Marlins enough, but his ego is wounded badly. Nobody was there to see him throughout the first pitch. And you people when you see him throw it. He can bring it. Bring it. He call 45 and the made person only 20. Nobody said like you said, it's past anyway. So that was the pull from the weekend. We had a phenomenal response in spite of the fact that we had those lame, old bedtime stories on it. I was saying somebody else is a bigger apology. You know what? Yeah, him. No, you see, I don't want to get into a whole thing in air. His dirty laundry on the ear. Yeah, I don't want to do it too much. But there comes a point where some things are cute. You know what I mean? Like if you have an uncle who's always a little bit drunk a little and he read it. But then if the uncle starts like stealing stuff out of your house, and the uncle winds up in jail and you have to keep going out and bailing him out. And it keeps progressing. Like a, you know, kind of like in certain movies saw. Right. You know what I mean? I don't even. I don't either. It starts spiraling out of control. So it goes from I can't find my keys and I lock myself out of my apartment and my computer just blew up. And it just keeps like a gigantic snowball going downhill. So I would suggest that somebody just kind of like slow down a little bit. Maybe if you'd stop you in an array of pills and give them the purple ones. And you're going to be better. He needs a few doggy downers just to calm down. I'm serious. The man is out of control. He is spinning out of control. So the poor where his life is just he's he's the kind of guy you will find under the overpass. And a couple of months if he doesn't just calm down a little bit. Okay. And even though he is working three, four hundred hours a week, I see he doesn't realize I can hear through that glass when I'm there. Even when I'm not there, I can hear through it. Right. I heard that cost a little comment and of course you and I are trying to take extra good care of him and And stuff it a little on the side, you know, and plus all the drugs you're supplying him. So what the and plus he's getting laid now is getting action from Treasure Island. What more does he want? So life should be sweet, but no. Everything is a major crisis. Take it. I know people like that. Oh, gee, my driver's license expired. How much effort does it take to open up your wallet? Take a look on your goddamn license and see when it expires. Huh? How much effort does that take Carlos? You little pimple head? Or that? Yeah. Simple then. Goopal. I had so many damn, I had such great stories I've facts about Saturday morning. I'm wondering what the hell is going on here now? What is going on? Saturday? I see nothing to run a website. Sunday comes Sunday goes I come up here. I look on a website. Same old hired crap. I'm embarrassed. I'm humiliated. We own apology to the masses up there. All 20 or 30 people who really see it's interesting that nobody reads the vet time stories Anywhere they just want to see naked pictures. But you kill that damn stuff? Starting to get me nervous about him. Oh, seriously. I think he is. He's Sarah Goldfarb Jr. He's Sarah Goldfarb Jr. Maybe she's been reincarnated. Now when his hair starts turning real white. White and short. Okay. Here's the new pool. I like this pool a lot. This should get a response. Showed off. You think? Yeah. Which overrated hot sub last scene is not word of the. Ideally. Perfect. But I think whoever sent me to pool very much. Which overrated supposedly hot chick is actually the biggest dog. I like that. What's not to lie? Absolutely. Sarah and here's the list of they sent so far. Sarah Kajesaka Park. Sarah Kajesaka Park, Rika. Paprika. Glory as Stefan. And whoever said that she was hot. Emilio. No, he didn't. Oh, you can. Oh, you can. Somebody must have. I'm guaranteed he never said that. You know, he said. You bet you spot you for. Hopefully in a slightly lower register. Mariah Carey with her one large your breast. You know, I love seeing away things go down. Sooner or later there is justice. Sometime you have to wait a long time for her. Her movie was a flop. Her albums aren't selling. She's desperate to try to rebuild her image. But we still see wouldn't touch you with Miguel's hand. I do like that. And Jackie's Johnson. We don't want to be picking on Jackie. Jackie, two pulls in a rubber. Why not since he's the centerpiece of so much attention. Did we ever get Miguel's take on Jackie Johnson? He's on the phone right now. Well, what do you mean he's on the phone? Huh? Oh, all right. Good. I always like that in the game. I was just because he's agree with me, but because he least he's honest about that. He won't be honest about the fact that Rina's trying to grab his ass because you don't want all his plain politics. You know, plus if he talks about it, then she'll really get encouraged. And the last. The last thing he wants is to encourage Doreen with the biggest ass he ever seen, but that'd be side to point. And a big rack, according to a, I don't want to go into that. For Religious Joke, and he's just pulling your chain. So there you go. Jackie Johnson, and then of course, we'll add a bunch more of whatever you think. That's an excellent pull. Thank you profusely, because the pull I had really was marginal at best. I don't even know what inspired me for the other one about autographs. We will. I will speak sometimes. I will say this. autographs, seekers. Just if you're, if you're going to get it with money in mind, because it's going to be worth something someday. Okay, I mean, it's a mercenary thing, but at least you're honest if you admit that. But if you're going to get somebody's autograph because you really want them to sign up picture or just just to had their signature. And I did that. See, if I never would have done that, I'd be, you know, full of crap. But I did that as a kid. Used to come up here to Toronto, but I may believe gardens get the, get their real early with a friend of on. We'd get the hockey players to sign their pictures before the game. Get autographs Johnny, Bauer, Frank, Mahabalach. Now, if you ask me why I did that, I couldn't tell you now, because I was a kid and didn't know better. Right? That's why I sang, why did you have a bar mitzvah? Well, I was a kid and didn't know any better, and they made me do it. I was a punk. 20s, I would like a street punk like on passions. By the way, good episode that I like it. 27 past 10 at 5, 60 I'll tell you what else you like. The number one Asian buffet in the university, Emerald Coast Chinese buffet man is as a place to be picked out. Sunrise, North Palm Beach, in their newest location in prestigious, temperate pines, start out with any of six different suits, even shovel them all in your post if you like. And then there are dozens of suck-of-the-on trays New York strip made a word with the gourmet center, their sizzling Asian grilled featuring all kinds of good things, grilled shrimp scampy style, jumbo scallops wrapped in bacon, and their new seafoods ain't jokk.

And you know there's lots of people who's out there to think just off, I smoke a little marijuana when I was in college. And it wasn't that they'd better pin joint. They'll maybe sing outside your honor, Melia. They don't think I'm fit to be on the Supreme Court. Yeah, I got the money. Let's do this quick and get out of here. I won't sit down straight. When I stop reviewing the law, I don't just review the law. There y'all. I mean, Tokyo. And I Tokyo to the East. And I Tokyo to the West. And I Tokyo to the East. Why not look up Sandra Dale Panas, best. I'll be Tokyo. Let's go, very one y'all. Big story, major bulletin Justin, do you see it? What no? Supreme Court allows use of race and law school's admissions. The Supreme Court just moments ago upheld university law school admissions policy to give minorities an edge ruling that race can be one of many factors that colleges consider when selecting their students. The ruling in the law school case preserved the concept of affirmative action for minorities who might otherwise be underrepresented on top campuses, but makes it clear that racial preferences must be used sparingly. In other words, if they can play basketball, real good and sign them up. The five before ruling endorsed the program at the University of Michigan Law School meant to ensure a critical mass of minorities on campus. The program is not an illegal quota the high court said. A companion ruling testing the constitutionally of another more overtly preferential affirmative action program for minority applicants was also expected today. Government has a compelling interest in promoting racial diversity on campus and the law school plan is narrowly focused on that goal of the court majority said. The ruling by a vote of five to four may secure that racial preferences have to be used sparingly. The high courts of the Michigan program does not amount to an illegal quota. How do you like that? You like it? No. No. If you can cut it, fine you're in. If you can't cut it by by, that's why it should be. This constant matter I want to go into it. Go into it. Go into it. What's the point? And also, with this week, we're going to the Saudi meeting. Back though. That may be today too. Don't go into it. Don't go into it too deeply. That's what the clearance said. So again, back to clearance. You know, and all that crap that you were talking last week, I want to want to want my health things about why he he's so wishy wash. You're so limp. You're not going to save you. Think Clearen says gay because after all, you, uh, he's the program director. Yeah. That was your conclusion. That's not at all what I was saying. That had you words. You switched. We're getting out of here. You're all man. You talk about trying to back out of it. So to speak. Get out of here. They're not. You were representing me again. Okay. So in other words, you said you said that he doesn't want to get late. All he cares about his sports. That's it. That's what I said. His life is rich and full of that. No. That's what I said. No. No. Everybody's horny. Okay. Even sports nerds are horny. Like there are less people that they're so into. Unless he's getting some in the locker room, which we don't know about. Unless that may be the answer. Others. That was what you were trying to say. Now you're trying to like color your. Yes, you are. It's wishful. You're doing the same thing. The clearance to poor clearance our program director. Then I'm accused of doing the Craig Stevens. So now finally came out of the closet. Anyway, how's he doing? Oh, we're fine. Oh, why theater? He wears those shirts. Here's another bulletin. Twelve hundred is plenty of evacuated in Florida this morning. A lot of crap going on, you know? Oh yeah. Well that's why I'm on the internet a lot here. There's something about being here because when I was there, I was able to do this. So I don't know easily. Probably because this stuff here works a lot better. Oh, you think? But now during the break, secondly, you go online here and check out some of these stories you what else going on. Well, Delta airline passenger suffered minor injuries this morning when they're Boeing 757 had to be evacuated to an fireball shot from the engine when it was started in Tampa. Oh, Delta flight 1036 from Tampa to Atlanta was leaving Gate of Tampa International airport about some 15 this morning. When the pilot's notice the small fireball shoot from an engine when it was turned on, said Bill wait a Tampa Fire Department spokesman bought 170 people on a plane. I wait to hear this. The evacuation shoots were deployed in some passenger-spraine ankles and other minor injuries when they slid down they were taken a hospital for treatment. So in other words, they had to slide down the old shoots. Oh shoot. Airports spokeswoman Brenda Gagahan, Gagahan, Gagahan. The fire was extinguished. That's her name. Okay. Said that the fire was extinguished immediately. She said the remaining passengers would be put on another flight. I'm sure they'll be real anxious to get on with the Delta flight when you think so. Right away. Oh, yeah, put me on. I went over there. Let's see if this one will take off. You can get this turkey off the ground. Point above the dude to that one. Find a way the good news, speaking of airlines. I want my good friend Helen in a whole world and I'm very delighted she changed her mind. She's not going to be tarry out in a couple of weeks not till the end of the year at least. And then she'll probably rethink that anyway. See, I thought she was getting squeezed out with all this air can of the crap. But she's not. Okay, I found out yesterday at the airport. So nice going Helen. She hang in there. I want to see her at least two three more times before she decides to hang it up. She's a sweetheart. She's one of the really nice people in South Florida. Not too many of them. So when you find when you just grab on women's squeezes hard as you can, that's what Dreen said. That's what he said in the gal. He's still got it though. He runs like a son of a bitch. That's why he wears that marlins outfit that he's like on a team or something. Runs like a maniac up and down a hall. Just evading her clutches. Okay, also before we get to the appool. Police in California probes suspicious truck. You see that store I'm sure you did. Yeah, they kept showing that truck and they're working and they're sniffing around it. Now wait to hear how the vaunted associated press. I want you to listen to the first paragraph. It sounds like it was written by somebody in a trailer park. Listen to the way they wrote this. Authorities early today investigated a big rig truck park near the Burbank airport after having gotten a tip that a truck driver was headed to town, possibly with terrorists in mine. He was headed to town. Terrorists are coming to town. Can't you hear that? I can't hear it. What kind of a sentence is that after having gotten a tip that a truck driver was headed to town, possibly with terrorism in mine. I mean, I understand they treat the American people like morons and most of them are. Did you see if I don't want to go into the test results? I'm not talking about the Florida ones like nationwide. I mean, people are just so dumb and scary. Yeah, they're dumb. And where did I see it last week? They were asking that they went into a shopping mall somewhere. I'm not in Florida. Thank God. I would have been too embarrassing for us. And we're asking who the vice president or was on a game show channel. Remember I told you that thing they were showing the bloopers. Right. And in the middle of that show, they went out. They took a mic and they went into a some shopping mall and we're asking who the vice president was. Like the current vice president. Yes. Yes. This was recently done. And the closest somebody in some guy got was a dick. That's the foasy guy. I think the vice president said dick. And then Bob you banked. So yeah, you're right. No, no, no, seriously, that nobody knew what his name was. And don't tell me out of sight, out of mind. Okay, we deal with really stupid, stupid, stupid people. The truck is on a road. I'm the city board. I would love to handle the northeastern of the LA X Airport. It was parked next to a so called fuel farm where tens of thousands of gallons of aircraft fuel is stored. We're investigating possible explosives on a park tractor trailer near the Burbank Airports and LA police officer who said he was too busy to give his name. TV news helicopter showed off his walking closely of the truck. No driver was visible. The officers were not wearing protective gear. Maybe a bad mistake. So the guy they were tipped off by a unknown caller from Texas from someplace in Texas. He said he used to work with the driver of the truck and that the driver's motive had to do with the war on terrorism. How do you like that? The Burbank landale pass any airports north south run where was closed with their traffic ever to the east west runway instead. Passed your trains were prohibited from stopping at the airport. So they're still checking it out. As we speak, okay, let me do the abric. And then I'm sure we're going to get tons and tons of calls at least four or five. Hey, look, I can't help but there's just nobody there now, you know? Whatever it is, it is. Ghost town. And as sure you want to backstab her the beast is, hey, I don't want for real. I'm sure for real is not listening on a way back to Boko right now. Don't listen, Scott turned it off. You know, he comes in there sucking him out with us because I was telling him about how for all through me into the bus with that Marlon comet. He only had two calls. He only had two calls the whole first 40 minutes. No, no, he said three. Or whatever, he said, okay, why would, why would somebody who's sucking so hard in there? You see what I mean about that wobbling tub of crap? He's a wobbling tub of craft to beast, man. You're not fooling me. You had a school for a little while. You had to pull over our eyes. This is the beast. Yeah. Water. Just cross pollinating man from one room to the other. Rent a yenta, let's him. Thup, thup, thup, thup, thup, thup, thup, thup, thup, thup, thup, thup, thup. Twenty to eleven and five, set and believe me. If he had three calls and 40 minutes, it's a lot more than we're probably going to get. They love him. They love your Scott. Just clean up your act. Oh, that's another thing we've got to talk about. His vulgar language. So you didn't, so let's clarify this. No, you didn't say your thought parents was a phag. Is that correct? That's correct. Like some people have drug interests that supersede any kind of sexual interest. Yeah. that some other sports is his drug correct. That's not what you said.

Why you saying that? I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't eat it. I'm married. Yeah, we're ready. You're so beautiful. I know. You're so successful. I know. You're so rich. I know. I can't believe it. What, what do you keep saying? They're like that. Because I can't believe I'm married to you. I know. I can't believe I'm married to you. That can't believe. Why can't you believe it? Look at you. You're a boom, boom, bandit. But did you spell the sign me for six months? No, we're in love. You did something to me. No. You did something to me. No. You want something in my Coca-Cola? You can't Coca-Cola. Look at yourself. Look at yourself. Look at yourself. I had coffee in my bed. I had coffee in my bed. I had coffee in my bed. I had condensed milk. Who cares? I had coffee in my bed. What do I do? I'm sorry. Oh, no. Fine. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, I don't like crying. But I love you. You want to sit on you when my big ass. Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up. Pass. I don't need to press up. I can't believe it. I got called Puffy. I'll jump your Lopez and Chris Judd. Spent their wedding night. I'll bet you've been your boy's life. That Jailov has never seen a penis in her life. Guaranteed. I just, you know, it's just my personal opinion. Just like your comments about the parents. That's not to say that he couldn't be. There was another one. Oh, so in other words, now you're covering your ass a little bit. Back to you. Now you're hedging your bets. It's not at all. There's nothing wrong with that. Of course. No, not to do anything wrong with that. Of course. Jailov. She belongs on the list, right? Absolutely. Oh, what? Oh, it's a looting. She doesn't belong on the list. She certainly does. Oh, come on. Megami, we're doing so well with Jackie's Johnson. You think Jailov is hot? She's hot. I'm sorry. Her ass is hot. Yeah, it's a hot ass. About 99 points. This fact she might have SARS. I think it's 103. But her postman, she has a nasty, butch, ducky, push. She looks like a boxer. Isn't that her nickname? That's what the benefit calls her ducky, push. Even Mommy has to come over once a week to change your dikers. But anyway, now see that's bad. Now you're starting to make, and especially on the heels of this great Steven's The Renaissance, certainly other day. Your heart, which, which would have been on our website, I'd like to show them from the fact that Carlos is like, no, look, the audience probably thinks we're exaggerating. Just like that thought I was exaggerating about what an asshole Moe is, which I was not exaggerating was I know. No. Oh, yeah, that's so funny. That can track confidence. There's nothing contrived about it. We don't play that game. That's a wrong show. Okay. That's Mr. Eagle. Wrong station. Wrong show. We don't need any contrived controversy on this decision. Believe me, we got more than enough crap going on real stuff. We're holding back lots as well. Yeah, yeah, he only knew the stuff that doesn't get on the air. Like about the time to ring got Miguel backed up against the corner out in the hallway there. But anyway, WSBN anchor to serve in gay pride parade. This is by Tom Jakogasas from Saturday, sunset and like, lift it up because I knew it was I'm on a back of my mind that Binear boy would screw up our website and I'd go and you little Twitter and by the way, if it's not too late, I'm canceling that check, but I guess it's probably too late. No, now you think that? It's too calling my bank. In fact, what I'm going to do is I'm going to leave instructions that if anybody with that name or tries to cash you check again, just to forgive this life in his face. Call of cops. Tom Jakogas. My good friend Tom was writing a lot more about me lately. Since I've been cutting him a big ass in the survey. So how about that Jerry, if you know, Williams, Dad, how time you idiot. This is, you know, what really bothers me the most. Here's a guy in the ease and Atlas opinion. You can write whatever you want. Just fill my name right and put it in the call. It was pleased and attended to now, not 91. Which you'll notice he never wrote about that either. Here was a, you know, so they write a little blurb about it. What's his name? What's the ugly guy gym in a sports section? It's already Tim Sarny. I do that. Yeah, that's shocky. Well, because I've talked about it so much. Yeah, but he writes a little blurb about morale and about. And then here's a major schedule change on the, one of the, the major AM station along with IOD, I guess is the only two that really come in a whole market. This time he read anything about that. No. So you can keep putting my name in these articles about, wow, I brought this guy to the closet. And I said the S word on the ear. That time why not rewind. I give the public some information about what's really going on. Not just this station, any station. You've got their mobile ex-son of be a step up in your department. God. But I'm the one that's on the touch. Oh, Jesus, K Christ. There was his middle of the Shabbatoi. K. It's, don't forget about his brother Jimmy Christ. It is an unusual time right for a TV anchorman to serve as grand martial of a local parade. It's when the parade celebrates gay pride. But not that there's anything wrong with it. Craig Stevens of WSVN Channel 7 except to the honor for yesterday's fourth annual Stonewall Street Festival in parade in Wilton, Manors. Can you imagine the turnout they hit for that? Stevens has been at WSVN for 11 years. The last two is the main male anchor. Doesn't regard it as a coming out. Oh, we're fine. I guess some people will say I didn't know that. But I don't think this is going to come as breaking news. Because I've been here so long. I live my life openly. Stevens said, over the years have been active in various gay charities in events. That's right, Craig. Now I'll follow the other our closet queens are a channel. Seven would like line up behind you. Then we'd accomplish something. That'd be a long line. Just fill up the parking lot back there where I would do use the meat. I don't know what the water. Fill up the whole guy damn parking lot. Hey boy, what's that in your mouth? Exactly. Stevens said he served as MC of an AIDS Walk and been on the board of directors of Center One, which helps victim Vades. However, the parade is the most public acknowledgment he's made of his sexual orientation. It makes him the most prominent member of the South Florida media to come out since Neil Rogers during the Anita Brankton, University of 1976. Rogers went out to become the most popular radio personality in South Florida. How do you like that? Always like that Tom Zikky. You know what? Even though he didn't want to yell at that down the corner of me. You're gay. He did. The thing is going around the corner of the station. I've open up the door to the studio and he put it. Poked to sit around. You're gay. Just like that. It doesn't anticipate a negative backlash either. Maybe it's because of the nature of this community, which is really a tolerant of different lifestyle. Oh yeah. All right. Ironically, Rogers is, and I see this is the part that just bugs the crap out of me. But that's okay, I can handle it because it's full of crap. Ironically, Rogers has made veiled references to Steven sexual orientation over the years. Steven said it bothered him at first because of the hurtful nature of Rogers' comments. But it's come to regard it as a compliment. Neil only talks about people he feels are important. Well, you get a little carried away Craig. Steven's ran his participation in the parade past news director Alice Jacobs as a courtesy. If we get involved in a base there, you're running past the people here. Or said Jacobs reacted to Steven's expected. I told him no problem. It's all about a cheat to a special backlash. Yati Yati. He's not the first front line anchor to be open about a sexual orientation. Randy Price who works at WSPN's sister station. Is that a play on words? In Boston is out as Hank Plant, who served as Anchorman at WKPI. And he's a WKPI ex and San Francisco. It didn't turn out to be an issue in either instance it says. I don't you like that. So Craig Stevens is gay. Aren't you shocked? And this made Josh Darrell, our program director aka Clarence's... ...here. This is rude. I mean, this is really making any difference in his case. No, not really. Because I mean, our light clearance is a good guy because he gets me my paycheck on time. Sometimes they're early with it coming up in two days. I'm certainly not going to make any cost to comments about him. But I will say this. I view him basically as sexless. Do you know what I mean? Like a neuter? Yeah. Right. I'm not saying he's a unit. He might actually have penis. Maybe. I'm not sure. It's moved like G. But I don't... I view him as sexless. I don't... I can't imagine him getting aroused or just... Unless it's over a ballgame. Unless it maybe like Hurricane's baseball. And certainly her kun's football. Brother, can you imagine him on the ballgings with Zagaki? That's why they limit him to the baseball games. Because football he'd be out of control. Oh my! Oh my! That's why they have to put the lovely beast in there. It's their whoever they put. Okay, so that's the ideal on clearance for anybody who cares anybody cared. Oh, no. I just thought, you know, since you out of them on Friday. Hmm, we're trying to like... At least put him halfway back in there. Okay, let's get this pull-a-go home. What do you say? I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... No, it is great because I understand that I really blew it this year. And this will never happen again. Can you... Do you have a rating book sitting around or somewhere? Oh, yeah, lots. No, but I mean, a reason one. Because I'd like to know what the last day. I bet it was last Thursday. I mean, last Wednesday. The last day of the spring rating book. They got a fall 2002 right here. I'm just looking at that. That's good. That's good. Because in the back on a back-inside page it shows you the rating periods when they end. Okay. So look at spring 2003. You got it? Yes. What's the last day? June 18. Oh, June 18. June 18. You got sort of range... And what thing was the 18? Wasn't that Wednesday? Well, like I just said, I am... Absolutely correct. Yeah, once in a while I fall into a bucket of crap. So like I said, the rating period has been over for five days already. So what the other week here? This is the summer book. You're going to get blamed for it anyway. What do I care? Honestly, I'm not saying this to cover up for your... No, it's... In that equation, that's very good word. But the fact that it matters, I don't know how you do it. How many years in a row did I talk about it before I got lucky enough to get out of the sun? How many years did I get in a... In the beginning, summer was great. Summer was fantastic. Kids were out of school, college students were home from my college. And everybody was having a good time. And we used to get all kinds of living and breathing. People during the summer who couldn't call us the other three seasons. The other three time parts of the year. Then what happened? And then they all started getting smart and getting out of town in the summer time. Everybody abandoned it because it kept getting more and more hot. And more and more stifling and more and more suffocating. I'm telling you, I don't know how you people do it. You have got to be a captive audience. You must be held there by absolute necessity. You're a job, your family, your prison, whatever it is that force you to stay there these months. We've produced people. July, August, and I'm not really so sure about September and I'll like reading it. Sometimes October. Right. Suffocating. Now I'm not talking about hot and humid. I'm talking about way beyond that. Vegas. It's 115. It's hot, but it's not humid. Here, like it's in the 90s. Every day this week, it's going to be. It's hot, but it's not humid. Power, broiler. Wow. Brutal. So I salute all of you who are unfortunate enough to have to be stuck in that. And then of course, they're those people. We love it. We love the summer weather. Here we are. Three of them. Here's Miami. Hello. Require. Oh, again. Second day at a row. Require. Any answers to saying. No. Ready. So every single day. This guy is out there. And this is this is one of the other ones doing different voice nods. And just notice that for the first time. He's got a new act. Ritar. No. 5.670. 5.60. Pomp 5. But what does that tell you? I've been going on for almost an hour now. We got our good pull here going. And the first call is the same asshole was the first call on Friday. So like I said, after the break, George and McGill are going to be doing the shoulders do the spots. All right. Now, just a joke. I don't want to talk about the middle. I don't want to talk about the middle. I would like to do that. Because I'd like to get about 10 names on the pulse of the air can put it up on there. But maybe not. 5.670. 5.660. Pound 5.660 on the AT&T Verizon line. Which overrated supposedly hot chick is actually the biggest dog. We've only got five so far. Cerrochagistic a parlor. Glorestephan. Mariah Scary.

And I'm going to be the first one to see the results of the video. And I'm going to figure a mark as an example. Wow. This means that you can find one, a mark withmanner in the end. And the two are in the middle of the video. But you can see it because there's also one more thing about it. It doesn't matter who's always making an experiment or not. It's simply an example because there is one example in the first because one of the elements is fighting with his friends. I never heard of later Jackson. He was Atlantis first black mayor. How about that? And he's died. And anyway, I mean, you just have a touch with reality. Okay, nothing. Nothing with Cuba. So I'm going to go with her anything about them. Here's a good facts. Ricky from the Moon for from Fort Myers to Port Sey Lucy. I'm not sure if that's a step up or a step down Ricky. But anyway, she says, one of the few mentioned the online Democratic primary staring tomorrow Tuesday, June 24, lasting 48 hours. Just mentioning it right now, Ricky. Website for registration is move on dot org where the voter enters their name and email or replace one vote for one of the Democratic contentes. And if I right after the show, I'm going to do that, Ricky. The purpose is to generate enthusiasm nationwide for the Democratic party. And of course, to vote the bushes out of office. Oh, thanks for reminding me, Ricky. Move on dot org. I'm voting for Bob Graham. You don't have very enthusiastic about that. Bob Graham's great. What are you talking about? I was just going to say the poll over the weekend. He smashed all the other contenders in the Democratic primary and Florida. And the against bush it was, I think, 53 to 40 for Bush, which isn't that bad. Right on the heels of that bogus war. Oh, sorry, Miguel. Come up to Miguel. I'll upset. He's a bush lover, man. He's obsessed with bush. Why would you say, yeah? See, he's laughing. He agrees. Aren't you obsessed with bush? Absolutely. I'm sorry about politicians. This is certainly. Nope. Anyway, move on dot org. But the only problem Bob Graham just doesn't have the recognition. Nobody knows him anywhere else. See, in the deep South thing, almost especially Florida, because he was our governor twice. He's a senator now. Things like that. You know, that even the dumbest of the dumbest of something might know who he was. Plus they got a street named after him and his family. But other than that, he might because he's only drawn one or two percent in all the other places. He's just done the who it only is. Plus, on top of that, as much as I like him in the fact he's got big balls and is open up a mouth and really knows what he's talking about. But in spite of that, he's just he's not a good speaker. You know, he's like a, you look at the democratic field. Okay. How are deans a good speaker, right? John Kerry is not only a good speaker, but John Kerry has that craiggy face who looks like he already belongs to them out rush more. Right? You see what I'm saying? Yeah. If you were to even though he's never been elected beyond senator anything else, but he looks right now like he belongs to the wrong way. He's just got that craiggy face. That's not good visual appeal. No, he looks presidential. You're wrong. He looks presidential even though he looks old and craiggy. I mean, you can be young and good looking like Kennedy was, which is good, or you can be old and craiggy and presidential looking like John Kerry, a little scary. Now let's see who else is a good speaker. Anybody on our Al Sharpton? Yeah. What? No, he can speak. He's your hood. I mean, I don't like a lot of his crap, but I'm sure see you laugh right off the bat. You right? You're such a hard ass. Nobody can get through to you. You're like a right. Speaking of my version, we're like a brick. He's a laughable person. Okay, but he's a, he's a, in fact, the first debate that they had, he was the one that they made monkey's out of the rest of the month. I was a bad term. He made him look bad. He made him look bad. He made him look bad. He, I'm just talking about who can speak. Dick Gabhard couldn't talk his way of a paper bag. He's awful. Me, mouth. And he's Julia, man. Oh, yeah, we know about him. Oh, here's another good one. And Nicole Smith. Thank you very much. See we're building this list on the faxes. They don't have time to be colonists today. They'll get around when we get around to them. Richard. He's one of my new favorites. And Nicole Smith. You got her who's taking this list down. Okay. Thank you, Jay and Tampa. Here's one that says Maria Bartaromo once he NBC is not spelled right. It's an I, R, O, M, O. I've got those come in whoever says she was hot. And there are a lot of people do really. All right. Back in the days when he's to watch that when I was losing all of my money, the gambling channel. All these guys when they take calls, you know, people asking about stocks when they have their so-called experts on it. Oh, Maria, you're so lovely. Oh, yeah. A lot of these really desperate. I was who couldn't get laid and answered them. They think she's really hot. Maria Bartaromo, the gigantic bags under rise. Right. They ugly nose. Oh, she's nasty, nasty, nasty. Look, I'll tell you another one. Although other than Maddahl, I can't imagine anybody thinks he's hot. Is there a glory of ancestor, Greta? Whatever hell I'm an ancillan Greta. Avavon, suster. Avavon Brown, sustan. Should we put her on her? Why not? It's free. I know nobody thinks she's hot. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's a joke. In fact, it would be a good pull one day. Who's got the worst the phony nose, Greta? Or what's your name on gambling channel? What is your name? Sue Herera. I don't know. Here's one. It says, what about Melissa Starks, a money that's football for your pull. Nobody, and by the way, what's the story with gilding? Oh, gilding, when do we wait? He already had this day off. It's not. Don't believe all this stuff he heard. Gilding, we back tomorrow. Okay. I'll always look and. But he'll be back tomorrow. Melissa Starks, do we know who that is? Never heard of her. Miguel must know it because he's a football nerd. She's cute. Some of her she doesn't belong on his list. No. Okay. Well, I'm taking your word for because I don't know who that is because I don't watch money at football unless the Patriots are playing a course. So we're building our list here. I think I'm going to vote. I'm not going to tell you I'm going to vote for. But I'll give you a clue. She's got one breast in the middle of her chest. She gives me. I mean, you talk about talent. You can't complain about her talent because so far they haven't found any. Well, if you ever saw Sarah Jessica Parker. It's not what I'm talking about. Are you hoping for her? Oh, yeah. I'm hoping about about five times. So you'll be Mariah Carey. I'd rather I'd rather have Andy Carey on my team any day. Remember Andy Carey third base Yankees? Sarah Jessica Parker's out in front George. How many times you vote? I've already got 11 and Mariah's only got four. Gloria Steph on five. He just keep. Pappa. Jennifer Lopez for and Jackie Johnson don't have anybody. Well, I mean, I see I wouldn't say Jackie Johnson's a dog. That's that's cool. That's nasty. Right. Right. Well, you say she's a dog. I think she's attractive. Ah, come on. She's not a dog. But I think she's does have a monkey face. Five six seven. Five sixty. Just the wrong animal. There's your problem. She's not too good. She's highly overrated. Maybe that would have been a nicer way. Of course we don't want to be nice doing. Oh, I live in nicer way to phrase the bull is the is the most overrated. The most over blown. Five six seven. Five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T of rise in wireless line. The Supreme Court today ruled that race can be one of the many factors of selection for admission in college. It can be. Which we say. No. Bad move. Here's the call from Carl Springs. Hello. Yes, sir. I was just listening to which I do every day and enjoy your show very much. Click it back on tentative. Me too. I hear you can mention about the. The. The. Ninth goes right on my man. The mayor of Atlanta who passed away. Me and her jacks. I see how fast he all passed. I absolutely. His body is not even warm yet. A funny story about him. I look at it in the late 60s when they opened up the big. Roller coaster called the Great American screen machine. Right. And they had a whole big deal. And he was in the front car because it was the biggest. I just begin with a Premier �tt up. The Traileries exploit a temat essential focus on car and set up and run into it a hell and forced to let the code out. Then a immediately up screen first stop the motor behind me. I was pushed up. Aww. x He wanted itじゃあ. Oh, no. his case of a hard to tell you. Yeah, but he was a very good man from that city which was still fighting the Civil War back in 1969. One other question. Yes sir. I'm on the webpage and talked about a book that you may or may not be writing. Is that true or is that just kind of a go. That's the one error of fantasy. Okay. Because I actually think it would be very interesting to read about your life I guess. My exploits. You know, count. They're thinking about it. Okay. Great. They pal. Bye. That's right about our exploits. All of us. What do you say? No. Several chapters about Beiner boy. So what's the story with him? He had any update on that punk? No. On that street punk? No. Why not? I don't know my phone's right. Do we have the new stories up there? I guess I could take a look, but I'm scared to take a look because he needs at least two hours. Oh, seriously. He doesn't realize that I'm sure because he thinks just like a lot of other people George who think I'm always going to go to bat for them and they push the thing a little. See, at least George learned his lesson man. He backed into a corner just shut his mouth. He put his like little Tom off thumb. Who was it? Little Jack corner? Yeah. That's not the quarter. Set in the corner and stuck in his mouth. Now, the same old crap is on here from like Friday. Conservatism here. They got that's a nice story to be in a boy, but it's old. It's ancient. It's old stuff. It's embarrassing for a high paid show like ours with our big fancy schmancy website that we're always bragging about. Get with it, Beiner boy. He's something I speak in a vice. How about that Nathan Horton, huh? Oh, I don't know. The kid that the a panther's drafted. And what was what was for well talking about this morning? I mean, so maybe this Samuelson kid, my Kyle Samuelson, that they got from the penguins. Maybe he does suck, but the fact that the man was they got him for free because they got Nathan Horton anyway, which is what they wanted in the beginning. So they got like a freebie thrown in there. So they have like an extra body, then they understand that they got an extra body. Actually, they pulled up a pretty good deal there. And he had a better come down a little bit for L. But again, it's your it's your night chasing. Yeah, that's the problem. 560, 50560, pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. I'm an who went through to throw out the first pitch yesterday and about 75 people were there in the beginning of the game and he said no more than 3000 by the end by the conclusion. The red hot Marlins are only one game under 500. There were only 75 games out of that playoff spot, the wild card berth. They got the Don Trail Bull as who's the biggest attraction since Vita Blue, who everybody in their world is just a camp to leave. How good he is. He's like 21 years old. Anybody care? Oh, no, nobody cares. Even Miguel no care. Did you go Saturday to see that game? I was there all week along basically. Really? Yeah. I'll be damned. Of course, like I said, there. There's a real fan right there. I got to get some free tickets. But at least uses him. He doesn't, doesn't throw an instrument or like some of us do. He actually goes out there and sees it. He had to come. Oh, that's right. Was some kind of promotion? Well, I don't have to go yesterday. I went. Yeah, but you wanted to see for all throughout the first pitch, didn't you? Not really. Were you there when it threw out the first pitch? Actually, I was outside of the stadium. Geez. That's why he's he goes wounded. You know, the guys only been here a couple of weeks. Some of them, but to at least pretend that we, you know, like him a lot. From the people who've won out of ideas like America's most talented team American Idol Junior and America's most talented kid, come to ultimate competition for young people. America's most talented. But show that let you hope for your favorite celebrities, patrol, son of grand. The year tonight, couldn't pre-hable Bruce Spring's being votes out unborn in the USA. A tiny Justin Timberlay-Gurgle's walk your body from the inside. And a thin dim will grow up to be Von Jovi Sains born to be your baby of America's most talented. Yes, right after America input, I go to my gun box. It's 11 16 at 5 60. Nobody came. I got the mad dog at two. In fact, we got no Marlon game. This, we got a pristine schedule. Right. And mad dog 2 to 4, the Humphrey will be a chillist today for the seven, the big seven to 10 proving that nothing is perfect. Any K 10 to 2 and you'll mark overnight 2 to 5 and a a m when it's a hot mole, Mohour David and Geldio will be back. Geldi will be back tomorrow. Hopefully those rumors. Okay. He's looking. 5 6 7 5 60 pound 5 60. Oh, so guess what I did during the break. I give up. I registered to vote tomorrow on the Democratic primary in the online. It's not it's not like a real primary. Obviously, but it's an online thing. And I registered to vote. What you had to do before your vote. Move on dot org. Okay. Get with it. Move on dot org. And tomorrow when I get the chance of going to vote for Bob Graham, I say proudly. You're going to do it. Me? Yes, you don't. If you. It doesn't make any difference. You don't have to be a registered voter. All right. I'm going. I don't think. Here I go. All they want. Go to move on dot org. And it's just his register for tomorrow's up thing. Okay. It's not an official thing. Jesus. Everything you take so goddamn seriously. Just because you're in illegal alien, you don't want them to trace the over you are and you're getting deported. By the way, here's George's address. This is a tape delay show. 560560. But on 560 on the ATC, I bet you Miguel's going to be voting a Democratic primary for somebody he sure can't win. Here's Boiton V. Chela. Yes, sir. Hey, I'm the Molly. You know, they just proved again that they're a little class organization. Why is it? Well, no, we're the first pages for someone important. Right. Presidential. But to have some guy on a radio station or if that's our show, it's unbelievable. Anyway, if you're born in Rochester, I believe. So I'm curious why you're not Bill fan. I bet you're a person. I'm curious why you're not a fan. There was a bill's fan in the old days. The old AFL, the above low bills. Yes, I was a bill's fan back then. Well, because then I then I wound up in Florida. I was a dolphin fan for a number of years. I mean, your things change things changes you go along. I was I used to go to all the bills games back in the days of a cookie, gold, Kristin Jack camp and the Daryl Lamonticados were great days. Right. Right. That's the George Sames from Michigan State. Go Patriots, baby. That's all I got to tell you. Oh, Pat's go, baby. Oh, that's all because that at time Brady. No, wrong. Free Tom Brady. Thank God. I was a Patriot fan one year before he came along. Thank goodness for that. Or people would have said, oh, just because Tom Brady's hot. Any is even the gulladmits he's hot. Yeah, real hot. He is. But anyway, let me just say this to you. The, uh, I don't want to start creating a problem here, but I just had voted. I gave a number of votes we had. We rocked to our usual, you know, start a little bit less than usual because nobody's in town. But the poll was taken off and look what we have now. Look on your screen, George. Oh, I got to go back from move on. The poll is down. Oh, no, it was up. It was up and now it drooped back down again. Somebody get the Viagra for Eric, okay, up there in Orlando. See, this is unacceptable. Beater boy is in jail or whatever. Now, this story is, and we can't get to God then pull a go. And this show is starting as slow as picking molasses, which is good because basically we'll be honest. Want to kill as much time as possible. Yeah, because it's summertime. No, no, seriously. This is not right. So I just voted for Brian Scurrie again, but I don't know. Well, what's, what's the reason for this? How come we just can't like we usually do put it up there in an ad to it as we go along. Is there any special reason? You just voted for Sarah Jessica Parker again. I saw you. Yep. So there we go. Those are the two votes. We had a bunch of votes on there. And so if you voted before, vote again. Right, to get about it. If and when that is Eric, every decides to get this back up, open up to the public in because it still says the poll is down. This man has more God damn problems up there. Jesus, when you get Bino Boat back in there, what is the reason he's not there right now? Right now. What is the reason he's not there right now? Carly? You could have come in late. Not that we don't love Miguel, but Miguel's not a computer was has to get his car out of impound. You know, what was the story last week? He had to go up to like, uh, Boca Tica or somewhere to get his goddamn car, uh, because they ran out of gas or daddy dead and dried up. They won't get the AC put into his odd cheese. But without it. Air me. How do you survive like that when every, how do you get out of bed in the morning when you know every single thing you do from brushing your teeth to taking a dump, everything you do could could possibly become a major crisis. I don't get it. I would definitely jump off my balcony here and believe me, I get a long way to go. How can you do that? I don't know. Just the most, just the most basic, simple rudiments of life. This kid just he can't cut it. He cannot cut it. God comes into washes car on Friday and all of a sudden he goes, this appeared out of there like crazy a five minute slater and we're all under a window. How do you disappear to? He had another faggot break. Oh, well, there's a valet key wouldn't open up the door and he had to go down and he would open it up for him. He dropped the keys on a floor to dog piss that his leg on and on he better be there tomorrow. I'll tell you that and very soon we better get this internet this website going again. Yes, my big optimal. Yeah, so Miguel's day off tomorrow. Okay. So he won't be there to hold our hand. I think we want to play a bunch of boss with Beener Boy, but you know, be real easy for parents to put the fix on an ex paid period, you know, we real easy. Hey, speaking of Tom Brady. Yeah, put Tara reading that list. Tara read is at his bitch. I mean, really? That's what I read. Now, do you know who that is, George? Sure. And she's hot, but she's got the last. Oh, and I see how about if we put Jail's ass on a rest of her. How would that be? All right. Then we can have a compromise between you and there. Yeah, she'll over. My put her on there. Okay. I don't care. We'll put anybody on it. That is of course if we ever get oh, here we go. It's finally up there. Eric, you're you're just infuriating. You're frustrating and for and don't call. Go call it up. Miguel. Go. Like that. You know, like you always do because he's not impressed by like Carlos C. Don't call him. He don't want to know from you. In fact, if that line rings that he calls on don't answer him, Miguel, there's it'll be Eric. Oh, what do I do? Oh, you allow that crap. Yeah, we're tidy here in that stuff and you're neurosis. Retired of it. We'd rather find out that Beter Boys and Jail on Death Row for killing a whole bunch of illegal aliens out there would make us happier than here and you go, whoa, like that again. You know, it's it's old now. Am I right? That's a movie. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound, sixty. Oh, but Neil, you're so much more excited than, uh, I don't think I'm any less hysterical excited now here than I was when I was there last week. Tell you. No, of course not. Oh, I'm just a psychotic because I have to deal with the same radio station, the same bunch of losers, the same misfit. I got Bob Eisenberg give me directions about my life. By the way, nice hairpiece Bob. I want to tell you, this is a true story. Bob Eisenberg, who's that one of our sales holes, a major asshole, by the way, but he was in there this morning and he gave a testimony. I wish we would have taped that for Charles Alfieri. He looked, he looked, I mean, for him. I mean, there's a hand, but it's for a hand. He doesn't look good as compared to like the human race, but for a hand, he looks spectacular. Thanks to Chuck Alfieri and he went on and on and he wore it on the air, I think, but he just was great. It was very nice. It was very nice Bob. Here's perfect. By the way, you know, Eisenberg, he's an asshole. I'm sorry. Yeah, we have a long memory Bob. Okay, you're not fooling me. He was sucking my ass so hard this morning by long distance. Good. Good. 567560 pound, 560 on the AT&T and for right. And at least I will say this, he realizes he's getting like a gift money. Thanks to me, you know, whatever he gets out of these couple of accounts is just a gift. Hey, that's a way, honey. Just take the copy over to Facts Machine from wherever the client is. Facts it up here to me. And that's it. That's the work he's got to do. It's just like stealing. Just like some other people we've gotten to building an owner appreciate that like Todd Dreck. There's a thief. There's people speaking to death rotors. People waiting to get executed all over the country for much less crimes that Todd Dreck commits every day. A man who is stealing from the till. Every time he takes a commission check, this man is stealing. Because you can't complain about the work he does. He doesn't do any. None. Zero. Go, let's think her. But he will come in here and hop on his scale. Oh, I weigh 165 pounds. Woopie do a pure crack. That'd be, you know, that's an interesting pull. I'm thinking about him and Mo. Because you remember I was talking last week about Mo and the fact that somewhere in the midst of that nasty miserable, hateful old rotten body, somewhere in there you find occasionally like a little glimmer of amusement of something that might be redeeming. Not with Todd Dreck. There's nothing there. It's all bad. Here's Port St. Lucy, hello. Hey, Neil. How are you? Yes, sir. How are you doing? Good. First time collar. But listen in here for years. I wanted to talk about that nearly. Uh, for Robo Rivera, but I before that I just want to echo your thoughts on the fanfare draft. That's what they did a heck of a job. Yeah. And they got a couple of tough young forwards there. You know, they get a good defense for now. Solid, uh, you know, player. And maybe they can go this thing back into a playoff. Well, I wouldn't get carried away. I mean, they have a long way to go. They got to get some established veterans. You can't keep doing his young student new organization crap all the time. But I mean, they did a good job, said, ready. Now they got to go out and sign a couple of veteran players who can really contribute and Valerie Burrie is not the answer by the way. They bring him back, which it looks like they will. That's going to be a nightmare. The kid, the guy can't play. He just a stiff. No, they're not going to bring him back. Are they? Yes, that's what they were saying. Oh, no. No. I think you're I think you're fight out by tomorrow. Today, they supposed to be the day they decide they're going to because they have to pay most of his salary anyway so they decided they rather bring him back and play it and just pay him for being someplace else. Oh, my God. Yeah, exactly. All right. Well, what's the deal with, uh, Rivera? I mean, he used to be the one defending voice on the station, the nymphoops, Fox News. Now all of a sudden when I watch him, he likes to all rate in the line with all of the other morons. Who stepped right in the line? He's an asshole. Yeah. We'll see with her all the way. It's not about, uh, it's not about principal anyways. Just about him. He always has to be the centerpiece. That's why he slept over to a rack. That's why he slept to Afghanistan. It's always got to be about him, you know? Yeah, it seemed like after he screwed up over in the Iraqi war there, when he came back, he seemed back with his head between his legs and they swatted him around a little bit. It's Fox and said, if you want to stay here, you better get in line or get out. Absolutely. I think you got a man. Yeah. Thank you. Go Kansas. All right. Go Leafs goal, baby. They have the number 785 picker. I think way way on down there. Tweet all their picks away. Nothing exciting. This is the week that the bill water's goes. Anybody care about the least? No. All can't, sorry. Let's do some hockey talk. Let's do a hockey show. Let's get judgment down on it. You know what? My limo driver. By the way, that's again, can you know, can happen from a nationwide limo? Yeah. Picks me have to go to the airport yesterday. He said, oh, you know, when you were given every nice short plug you gave me the last time. It was like a little dig in there. Can I notice that? See, I'm even. I may be older than the equipment. I mean, I look for a good, which is an understanding, but but I don't miss much when you give me that nice quick plug. You know, so nationwide limo, they're the best. Can the helper and he's a super guy. It's much to be all over the place. Is that long enough for what? Can can help or nationwide limo? But anyway, he was making a point about the jugs McDonald, which I guess one of their limos was picking him up to slap him somewhere like maybe to the old age to a place. And he said to me, how did he ever get that name jigs? And I thought that's an interesting question. I mean, not real interesting, but how would you get in it? Is that a real name? Like a one Irish name? Might a name do that? No. No. Well, where does somebody like maybe somebody looked at him and said, oh, the jigs up, right? I could have been it. Let's get jigs make time for a hockey show. Oh, booze. At least I don't have to buy no dinners anyway. In addition to which jigs don't need no more dinners. 28 past 11 at 560 WQM.

Hank it's Julus for the seven to staff for now Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Pretty good. Did you watch me the press yesterday? No, I did not Howard Dean was on and Tim Russell sliced and diced him really he has no shot of winning this I've seen all the democratic candidates and there's only one that can be judged of you push and The answer is general Wesley Clark. Yeah, but he's yeah, he's just sniffing around and I saw the piece on him yesterday Well, he may be sniffing around there's a website called draft Wesley Clark dot com yeah, and he's posted an ounce within the next two months whether he'll run But you know something I did see that piece yesterday about him and I watched they showed a couple of clips from his speeches and boy He's he's that much of a speaker either. He's about his dynamic as a dead frog. You know well I don't know what you watch, but he's been on me depressed and he was very informative and But I'm just talking about as a speaker. He just isn't I guess I don't like him and of course being a general or you know, remember Eisenhower and all of that crap I mean America goes for that kind of stuff. He might be the one guy that could win, but he's Dynamic well, he's got an excellent biography in addition to being a general support He's a road scholar. Yeah, he finished number one Russell is Bill Bradley was a road scholar too now look how dynamic he was you know he couldn't have been a fist election Right, but this guy was a general. He was the supreme ally commander of name He was graduate number one at West Point. I think you're wrong when you say he's the only one Could be to my think Bob Graham could be to but I just don't think he wouldn't have an nation Bob Graham is frail He's not gonna win Iowa. He's not gonna win New Hampshire. He's not gonna win South Carolina Yes, I'll be out of the race by then. I don't think he can win and then I just say then I said I don't think he wouldn't have an nomination But I think if he ever could get to that point he could win the election Well, I think I think Bush is very beatable Well, I just agree I think Bush is gonna win in a landslide and let's the Democrats nominate General Westley Clark You let hate laugh all you want Wait, they stopped well, what is it that sets him apart so heads and shoulders of all the other candidates? What is it? He's articulate he's telegenic He's not articulate Oh, wait, Neil have you seen him on me depressed? Sir, let me ask you something. Why do you keep referring to me depressed? I've I didn't see yesterday because I was on rude I was on an airplane okay. It's hard to watch and a plane I do watch me depressed and how he speaks on me depressed Why was he so much more dynamic there with the eclipse that I saw of him making speeches over the weekend? Meet the press is the most important political show That's not the point the point is the public doesn't know we can't see their voter support a candidate because I have They look on me depressed most people in this country don't watch me to press They wouldn't know what time it's out of where to how to find it have a nice day sir. Why am I arguing with this guy meet the press? Did you see him on eat depressed meet the pet had to be that had to be a paint your balls by call had to be I pray that it was there had to be a quack So let me ask you yeah, did you see Eat the press Let's see here's one it says I watched recommend for dreams the second time over the weekend because there was a lot of them is the first time Could you tell me what happened the first time Harry tried to get his arm looked at the hospital when they arrested? Yeah, yeah, they were arrested a good good guess That's how they got from the hospital to with the slamer. That's how they got there. They were arrested That's how they big share steppity that big a view for the pusher guy Also regarding voting on your pulse. I have bell-sought the SLI can but I don't vote as many times I want by way. I want you know that yeah Don't be given people away. Yeah, we have enough chronic stuff. They're already So it's not scientific it's just for fun. Okay. Don't be so uptight your fact starts out very good I'm glad you like the movie and Harry went to the hospital along with the Damon Wands and he missed the way in and they canceled the fight 5 670 5 60 it's a great movie and I did thought you know, it's not worth it But this guy he's peddling me. You know, he's peddling me. I like Bob Graham better than I like co-wrestling Clark Yeah, but I know In addition to which it's only June of 2003. There's a long way to go. It doesn't get serious till the beginning And exterior you got months to go here. Okay, now if you saw Bob Graham I meet the press See but you didn't Now I did not because he was not it was interwoously Clark. I saw in fact I was hoping I watched the piece I'm trying to make it was that must have been yesterday morning before I left and there was an extensive piece about a couple of appearances He made over the weekend and about how he was you know the media was like all following him and all excited about it And he kept playing cool. You know like oh well, why are you here all I did was come here to well, you know to the wife my ass And they showed him making a couple of speeches. He was about his dynamic as a frog's fart. Okay That doesn't mean he couldn't be a great person. It couldn't be a win election But I'm just telling you this business. He's articulate. He was great on me to press you don't have to be great I mean to press you have to be great when you get up there making a speech and the public is watching another god They made news. That's when I mean you get up there in debate against the god damn compulsive liar That's when he had to be great. I thought he was pretty mealy mouth In addition to which he was just spouting a bunch of glittering generalities about nothing in particular And these two speeches he was made insane anything as opposed to Bob Graham who dissects Bush and talks about the god Then the real threat with his balonist country and about how they kept all this information from the guy Them said it until then's good, but I mean upon Graham or our grant you maybe he can't win But he's been dynamite. That's our goddamn senator. He's been actually he's been one of a few people to the god damn congress with a pair of balls He's been one of the few Democrats that there's to say anything All the other ones are like sticking their goddamn finger rock to window to see which way to web Well, when is blowing which way to poles or blow because they're afraid he might the shoot themselves in the goddamn foot Including condational as a real piece of crap a real mealy mouth and Nancy Pelosi the same thing.

I think he's very weak. I think he went to read because I was watching I was watching those tips this week and on the news and I was sitting there was like rooting for him like you know Come on and say something and be a little bit forceful and really and he was there Just he didn't say anything. I'll tell you what I think it would be his grand Clark Okay, all right. Thank you sounds good to me Five six seven. Oh fine.

George is going to be due to the show from Babylon this year 567.0560 pound five 60 on a AT and T Of course you know where that is now and Verizon wireless lined Don't we own it if we do now That's what I'm saying Here's Hollywood hello Pretty good I can't see in this more guy and always good to be split the hell that he did a Joe Loast you tell us I Missed that I guess if I played the call you probably would up I'll play the call, okay? This is a call Huh? Thanks everybody appreciate thank you. Okay. Thank now which cut is it on here's the number three? I'll give you it update. Okay This allegedly a week ago shattered a and again is a lot of cotton well, there's really not any kind of reverse except that Most not trying to deny he was the one who had the call Dave Higgins says he is absolutely positive He said he would bid both Mo and Jellies life on it that it was Mo who made it call off the air to Joe Rose Trying to tell him what to say what to do what to figure out he ought to get up date of what took place Just now off the air because I think it's important here this Howard is called the radio station Howard David Who I get along with great I thought He called me an asshole Saying I was trying to stir it up my point back to Howard is don't listen Listen to 101.5 let me see what age group 101.5 for Howard maybe 102.7 some easily listening love music So you could focus on your wife and your family and the grandkids instead of listening and always calling the radio station He's becoming Howard the caller like Howard from Boca Howard from Boca It's like it you know it's okay So anyway he's he's listening so this one to get the message out and don't call my show to just for a record Don't call off the air cuz I don't want to talk to you and I don't want to hear you on the private line congratulations You know the private line number that's great, but don't call cuz you're not coming on this show You've got you've got your three hours five to eight Monday through Friday you can talk all you want but you're not coming on this show and we'll leave it at that All right, I got nothing against you. You seem like a decent person no And I know you've been getting that taking a big hit on the radio station for everybody else But it's over me and you've done done five done Now let me just say this to you here's another piece of evidence is the jury ways in on this and examins the situation Whoever was that call let's assume we aren't positive it was Moe, okay? Whoever called called on a bat line absolutely okay now how many just off the street or Niri Schmidt's distribbers have the inside line right right, but maybe they I produced some questions just made that up and there never was a call Oh, maybe they've taken just lied about that that it wasn't on the inside line It was just somebody like on lines free or something like that anybody believe it at or the phone didn't even ring They just Actually there was any such a recall Dave Higgins just made it up because he's a Schmidt's distributor wanted to create a lot of more problem from all see Look the preponderance of the evidence is so overwhelming here that in any court of law in any kindergarten classroom everybody would be it. Why you wouldn't even waste their time? I mean you can go down the list. Why does Neil Rogers despise Moe Howard David? He's an asshole. Why does George Rodriguez despise Moe Howard David? He's an asshole. I just zacked hate Moe Howard David. He's an asshole Why did the beast hate Moe Howard David? He's an asshole What is Jim and it's secretly all of he's not a position to say it despise Moe Howard David? He's an asshole. Why does Joe Rose despise Moe Howard David? He's an asshole. I just hate Goldberg find him reporting repulsive and refuses to acknowledge his existence. He's an asshole. There you go I leave anybody out. Mom mean you know See what I'm saying we're all wrong and McGill you notice that was nice to you. I left you out of the equation Absolutely Well, I mean we got to save you with somebody But that's it and I'll do people out there want to amuse yourselves You can continue saying oh, this is really some funny stick you know Fine believe whatever it had you want like I'm telling you before there is no way in the world that anybody even though a wild hysterical imagination like I got that could create a character like this. No Not to mention the fact that his his history precedes his ass, you know his ball is Every place else whether was Westwood long whether was the jets whether was the Celtics whether was the box you name it same story No your reputation precedes you and believe me in a 1314 months You've been in our midst you've lived up to it and then some He's a hidden run and Schmidt the stir, but that's what he is you know starts the crap behind the scenes and then goes on here Very indignant. I resent the take it very personally not by all the bull crap, you know All I crap and The fact of the matter is since you got me stirred up on it. I wasn't even gonna talk about where did this come from? We're in the song from the new edition to the story which is I see the new thing with denial There is a little bit late as a sense this happened a week ago. Senator is a little bit slow another in position. I see Well the fact of the matter is we know for damn sure that wouldn't be the first time that he's got a history of making all these calls off here And addition to which is constantly listening to this radio station This was part of the whole big thing with you and with me and him months and months ago Wow, his wife can't pick it him. You know what I just like Joe said Joe Rose hit it. I'm not listening That's all fine something else to listen to go out there and play golf all day get yourself a nice melon home or something But don't be listening to the idea and radio station all day.

Oh, here's a fact is what did your Sander that prompted most alleged call after put legendary because we know Dave Hagan is right in pulse of liar That's a little bit Little bit of the background just very briefly because I'm on a dwell on more than other two three hours is that Joe was mentioning on a year that the the conflict the Rift between mole and guilty was growing and that you could it was palpable You can hear it on the ear the fact that there was a certain hostility in the run at morning show right Which everybody been talking about that I mean it's not a secret there everybody who listens knows it everybody right everybody And mole became indignant about that and if it was him the essence of the call was what did your full aircraft And you're a batch diver and you're a liar above a bond Nobody there's nothing going on a girl. Do you know I get along wonderful and you're you're stirring to pot? You're stirring up trouble and stuff like that and Quite practically I can't imagine anybody else in the world on the inside private line Calling in and spouting that can you? No, oh, okay, you don't have to chuckle at the end there. You have to do a little bird thing Hey, they're very you know straightforward question. I think the Andy we try to stay with you That's it, but of course we don't know if I call at all ever kidding First of all anybody knows Dave Hagan. I don't know Dave really well, but Dave is not a he's just a no-nonsense kid You know, he's not the kind of guy that's it's not like the beast now the beast would have been accused I could say yeah the beast on it, you know, because that that's his style He's the kind of trouble making little yenta that would do something like that In fact now that we think about the beast knows the inside line everybody Oh, how is his how are the personation? I don't know, but we can turn the Christ. Yeah. Oh that that was the beast Wow This is starting to get pretty thick That's some water That that's the only possibility that's the only person not that I want to show the beast out of the bus because can you imagine what that bus would look like when we finished You'd probably crad is really bus. Like yeah, like one of those exactly I was looking for the conversion chart the temperature conversion chart was I found here.

No, you can still breathe Although we do have a small advice because it's real steamy but the humidity is only 42 percent wouldn't you just die for only 42 percent? I'm gonna just die when I leave the building today In the 90s for like so I got back in Teva that whether which are like the how whether as long as it's not humid and Stifling and suffocating you catch my drip. Oh, good anyway I was just looking for that and I found at the same time another roof thing I had sitting around with all my crap That was a facts from a list who said the big Leboski's a great movie Carlisves full of urine Now, did we decide about that? He said that he liked it, but he thought you wouldn't like it there for he didn't recommend or you haven't seen it.

Oh, yes, they continue drive now. What's the upshot? It's very convoluted this thing about the Canadian pharmacies that are selling drugs in the US to senior citizens It's saving them from being ripped off so bad and save them in many case 50% more under prescriptions And they're trying to put the Kavash on at and the One of the committees one of the set committees. Remember the end of the week they as they overruled it Right, and they said that they can it's nothing illegal about it. They're getting no it doesn't Heart that represents no threat to the public safety, but you know, it's it's not gonna go through But in the meantime, I'm just wondering what the status is anybody now. Oh, I don't know Because everywhere you go you see signs like kind of my on a PO box places Check about discount Canadian pharmacy, you know prescription all that stuff. I don't want to say no. No, you don't because you don't take any drugs that are like illegal I take aspirin now now this is interesting now Miguel has just You see here's a god at so conscientious he just he wants to do something he wants to make it I'll saw feel like he earned his pay today. He has a hard chances He has got some sand and spider what you all the stories you told That's how much he's making and he wants to earn every penny of it I mean like last year when we didn't have a best of and you liked playing him for it and come to find out it was because you're lazy It's not because of Miguel Because you were too lazy to put the material together right Is now what it was sure while that's not argue over spilled milk okay It were caused that were made by mole we go Saturday on a Joe Rosho let's have a clean slate okay white Plains with both hands from the back to front WQAM Hi pretty good sir Hey a couple things you know about last week also soon at your room that morning is matter Fact was very long over and I was just gonna see the radio and you know when he came on there's no way he could Is that I mean it was just you know for one minute for the next that mean it just seems Very real to me but With more as I would hate to see him good because it's been so much fun all the mileage He's not going anywhere Okay, I hope you know all you know whatever man, but hey Let me tell you he has a year and in the eight or nine months off in a contract and I guarantee he's such a hard as if they make him Get up in two thirty in a morning and come and change everybody's under where he's still gonna show up I'll see you at a poll last week. I don't know who the call that you mentioned whether that was for all throw voice or not Yeah, and I I think it is and the reason I said that is that I read this medical study This is very well, but there's a medical condition where people are pulling with their spink their muscles and their vocal cords switched Really actually I think he's got a spink their muscles but then is Repentant Thanks for the vote of confidence. Okay. There's a little shot at for real no is clim media But if you had anything better than my dry gas on a Monday I'd like to see him blow some dry gas right in the beast push which I think is what he did That's gone Scott that makes up for the fact he's see it was just like the giant in the business that franchise It's always I don't know how I get into this okay Cause in the beginning remember when they had I would do when we first got the marlins I used to go to all the games a lot of games And sit in those crappy seats over to be hand first base. I mean the seats were good, but it was just that it was behind Jav Bush and all his right wing Republican friends including that big tank from Tel Iasi is number one fundraiser. Got a way to about 800 pounds I went and then of course, you know, you start losing interest because it was boring is all a hell It was a hundred degrees in the shade and then they win the series 97 a Wayne sold everything off by the way There's an interesting book. It's called If they don't win it's a shame the year the marlins bought the world series by Dave Rosenbaum Do we then I'm sure George Roy. Yeah, I got my panel when it's a shame the year the marlins bought the world There's and then actually paid all those guys They went to world through then he as we all know he as promised because they wouldn't build a new stadium like a little spoiled child He had dismembered the theme He disemboweled it and then we had little John Henry and his quizlings and remember the day That they hit him on the first team and I walk into building oh, hi Neil somebody could drink and they looked at me like oh like Frankenstein just walked Yeah, I'm the enemy it's because any arraggios nobody shows up up They're right right Bull crap your fault in for us doing the same crap now I don't care what the arraggios says about he thinks about the marlins. It's really and then finally he admits to me that it's quite a what it says in the box Korea's that a 10,000 this is a teen. It's now almost 500 They swept the series against the week admittedly week devil raised but nevertheless And he said if there was 3000 people there was a lot So who's kidding who huh? Would you eat yesterday?
