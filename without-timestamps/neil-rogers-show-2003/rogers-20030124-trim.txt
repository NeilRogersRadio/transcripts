Why the you've breasted? The story is funny. This weekend, going to the rack here and... Let me ask, here we go. Okay, so what was the maxest dungeon world? To the world! Coming to the bunch of light is courtesy of Bulmuebe Strong Survived. Set an X-ray duration sign I say, and the owner digger, and violate the X-ers of Evol. In a steel cage, dead lumberjack match. Also scheduled to appear. Color up, open mouth, and stone dead sea vustin. On wishful horror. Can you smell what Steve Seren is cooking? The Sunder! Sunder! Sunder! The crowd will shake the world, will we? When the atomic hunger. Of any anthrax, big alkydame, Mr. Mustard, and gold, murdering the world, heavyweight gentlemen. Feel the sting of a sore loser. In the smallpox battle royale. There is no vaccine. When you catch the Bibi-Beever, of contagious hand-a-hand mortal combat. Though weapons are mass destruction world to world. This weekend! The Bibi-Beever is going to see him. He's a bunch of idiots. I know two at five, 60WCM happy Friday to it. Let me give it a little seminar here, okay? To someone to building a little team to understand the definition of a backstabber. See a backstabber, somebody who scolks around behind the scenes. And like tries to get people canned and create problems for them, and blame other people for their own failures. That's a backstabber. I don't play that game. I kind of like right out here when you open. I'll tell you right to your face. I think you're a pot, you know? I think you're show sucks. Or whatever it is, I want to say about you. I'm just talking general, not anybody specific, follow him to. So I think some people need to have explained to them what the difference is between a backstabber, and somebody who's at least open an honest enough to tell you what they really think. Right to your post. Follow what I'm saying, Mo, and by the way, as far as Zach is concerned, watch you back, because when I come in this morning, there are notes posted all up and down the hallway. So everybody must be on to this now. Saying, watch your backstack, you're going to be next. I guess the deal is he's the next scapegoat for the morning's bad ratings because he hasn't got Mo enough good guests. That's what I'm hearing. Now let's see, we had Carolyn, the beast who's unprofessional, which we saw yesterday would have this terrible display on the update. And now it's going to be Zach now. Zach, who happens to be an okay guy, but he can't afford not to be working for like even five minutes. Because to maintain that girth, he needs to continue to shuffling it in there. I have never any time that I've been here. And I walk around that corner to go take a leak, which is the only time I dare rent her out in the hallway there. I don't want to trip over that bag. But he's shuffling it down in there. Maybe it's stress eating. You know, a lot of us fat people, we understand what that's all about. A stress eating. Poor Nell Carter, if she would have cut that out. You know, Nell Carter? She died. Yeah. Nell Carter 54, everybody like Nell Carter, she was like fun. But then again, fat. Diabetes? She had a brain aneurysm a few years ago. The fun people are the fat people and the fat people are the dead people. That's right. Nell Carter 54, TV and Broadway star died yesterday suddenly. Found by one of her 13 year old sons and girb-ly hills. And she died. Yeah. Also, you're good co-sphre and fallen for a Myers. Who sent you those holiday cards? Yeah. Which he asked, did you get them? Yes, he did. I got them in the stickers and everything. You got all your stickers. It says not sure if you heard about this, speaking of people dying. With all of the sadness and trauma in the world at the moment, it's worth reflecting on the death of a very important person, which almost went unnoticed last week. It passed by us and we apologize for that profusely. Guess who died, George? I give up. Larry LaPries. Who? Well, see, it would know him by name. The man who wrote the song, in fact, Wayne High Pingers, probably in morning right now too, because it was one of Wayne's favorite songs. The hokey, pokey. Oh, no. Oh, no. died peacefully at age 93. He died? Yeah. The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin. It says they put his left foot in, and then the trouble started. Oh, no. That's bad, Paul. That's really bad. You know, if you'd be laughing right now. Yeah, that's hysterical. Oh, Paul and Fort Myers, what time is your show on? As a matter of fact, hey, hey, don't you listen, Clarence? Or something about his left foot in and then the trouble started. He was doing the hokey, pokey. He just didn't want to go all the way in there. And Wayne High Pinger. Remember when Wayne High Pinger was doing the hokey, pokey at the Marlins games, way back in the beginning? Yeah. Oh, my God. It was hokey and they ought to stick his ass into pokey. Let's talk about the Marlins. No. Okay. How's the pull come out from yesterday? And boy, you talk about psychic abilities again. By the way, is it cold? You just wait till I get started on those assholes. You know, you people, I don't watch the other channels, so they probably just is bad. You people at Channel 4 News Need Mental Help. Freeze warning, and they've got the graphic in the bottom right hand where they got the 4, you know, and with the temperature and with the icicles coming down below. The icicles on your testicles. Oh, it's going to be so cold. Now I can understand for the farmers, you know? I'm not insensitive to the agricultural or crowd out there in the great pickers or whatever, but we don't have grapes. What are the lettuce pickers? Stubbaries, whatever they're picking, those pickers. But I mean, for the rest of us, so it was cold. Wow. And the meantime, you look at up north, for example, in Toronto, like 85 degrees below zero Celsius, whatever it is. When it's seriously, when she'll like minus 29, they're not into panic about it. It's cold. Say, put on a coat or a sweater or both, and the life goes on. Have any trouble starting your vehicle this morning? No, I was dead. No. I'll always slip through a red light. No, my God. See, the people here, when you think about under the ideal circumstances on dry. Pavement. Can you imagine most of these people trying to drive up north on the snow and ice? Can you even begin to imagine that? Oh, and he starts pitching a little bit. So there's one problem on the, I don't know who he is. One of Brian's underlings there, the weather fur is underlings a channel for. He's going on about keeping mind the three peas. And of course, we know what the three peas are at channel for in all the other stations. Here panic, panic, panic, panic, panic, panic. It's a freezer, oh my God. What are we going to do? It's going to be cold for a couple of nights. I don't know. We closed the windows. Did you? Yeah. I walked out this morning, got my papers, no jacket. And he always cold. And our hustle back in the house, and I could say I lingered out there. But I didn't like getting him up to pneumonia. I didn't turn into a human icicle. But it's going to be cold folks. This is someplace. Anyway, the result is yesterday's pool. And I said my psychic powers. And I go home, I turn on the news. Bob Graham's having heart surgery. Heart surgery for Governor Bob. So he may have he's going to reevaluate after they put the pieces of his heart back together. And going to reevaluate and March, you may have to drop out or not. We'll see. We asked yesterday who would you prefer to be the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004. 1165 votes on that and speaking of votes. Look at the way I'll present. His popularity is dropping like a rock from the top of the imparted state building. Man. Just drop and real fast now as the people are finally starting to catch on. Nobody has two nickels to rub together. People are starting to get real antsy about this war that he's insisting on getting going. On interestingly enough, a couple of things we talked about yesterday, including his appointee to the White House AIDS panel, while they just changed their mind. That's right. Jerry Thacker. Good bye, Jerry. Oh, okay. See ya. We'll get in with that. Also, that's story about the, what are they called of again? Bug chaser. Bug chaser. I also kind of unusual term. That's exactly what they call the bug chaser. Come to find out just like I told you, the guy who planted all the seeds for that ruling story says, Oh, I just made it up. He said it might be one or two crazy people like that. Trying to get infected with HIV. But he doesn't know. He doesn't know. And he couldn't know. I'll get to that too. But it's, uh, that's the popular thing nowadays. You got to bash somebody. Let me 165 Ots yesterday to pull. Don't care. They all suck 297. 5gb 263. This is before we knew about his heart. Don't care. I'll vote for Bush regardless. 212 are usual 18.1%. And that interesting our consistent that number is. You may not be good, but at least you're consistent. Oh, John. Oh, and I'll speak in a bush. Jet bush is out of the closet. Now it is devious plants to subvert the, uh, classized amendment. And they still don't care. Now they still don't care. Well, that's just the way it is. Good car's lot of money. John carry 139. It may be scary to some, but scary. Carry. War hero. Good guy. Al Sharpen 55. That's scary. John Edwards 51 dick. Gibhard 34. Isn't that a little bit, this concerning to you? Because if the last thing we need, it's another dick in the White House. Gary Hart 31. Howard Dean 29. They say Howard Dean was very impressive out there in Iowa that he was the most impressive of all the candidates speaking. Everybody was just that he really tells it like it is. Doesn't pull any punches. So here's another guy that could come from obscurity, just like some others have done and who knows. Uh, Julie Roman only 24. We're delighted to see that. Oh, Chris Dodd 17, even though George has no ID who that is. And General Wesley Clark had 13. 1172 votes pretty good that we sponsor there. Yesterday's pool, which was kind of like limiting because let's face it. We got a lot of people out there to say, FAT. It's politics. We don't care. Although a lot of people did say that was the number one they all suck. They all suck at work pain or wicked price for it. Now the poll today is going to be when we get around to it in a couple minutes. The poll today is going to be the final runoff and George would be delighted to hear more. The experiment only 24 we're delighted to see that. Chris Dodd 17, even though George has no ID who that is. And General Wesley Clark had 13. 1172 votes pretty good that we sponsor there. Yesterday's pool, which was kind of like limiting because let's face it. You know, so it's not of any interest to them. Ah, here's all these old funny studies. You know, living in the pet. That's okay. So bad reminiscent of our good stuff. It's not like, but are we done taking names? Are we doing the runoff today? The runoff is on the pool, but I'm just, this isn't like rocket science. This isn't going to go down in the Smithsonian Institute of Broadchasing. This is just for fun. Oh, I forgot that's right since you've been working here. Fun is any head at the second kid. Fun is no longer in George's vocabulary. Remember what it used to be like, probably not. No. What about your book? WQA in the out of business line. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great. What about the... And a cold, though, isn't it? That is cold. Oh, man, if I were you, I'd be real careful. I got my gloves on. Okay. What about the K-pop tree? Had it. Okay, before there was a limb dilemma before there was... Had those two, Woody. So anyway, you know, speaking of gloves on. The weather for you had her gloves on last night. Just see that you probably don't watch a channel for now. I do watch, sir. She had the black leather gloves and I was thinking, how soon before the whip and the chains come out, too, you know? Below the desk. It would have been bad if they wheeled out and bishops body right there out of the set. It would have been that spec by the way. Oh, the internet is back and I can't look at Tom Brady on my... Desktop here anymore. I had the cursor right out of his crouching for the second time this morning it worked. It's all I have to do is put the cursor right. My internet is not back and glad that yours is. But my name's doing... Oh, there it is. Just a little reluctant. Just a little under reluctant side. And there is the pool. Nice going, Eric. What's your favorite South Florida business that's no longer around? This is the final. This is our runoff after three days of herniatic efforts, which got George Reesai County because no building was fine, but building how buttering it's not. Oh, all of a sudden business they were talking about yesterday in the Grove that they're going to put the big condo complex. Which I never heard of before because the Grove isn't exactly my territory, primarily because it's in Dave County. What's the name is it begins with a tea, like a big bar. A big bar in the interview with some of the patrons. They were really pissed off. I had a strike at a place that I had a place that I had. One guy in it was 14 sheets to the wind. You didn't see that? You better start paying attention. You don't know who Chris Dodd is. You don't know about the great watering hole there in the Grove. In fact, one moment was on her saying, this is the Grove this place. And I'm thinking to myself, if that's the Grove, I thought like me fair was the Grove. I thought the railroad tracks were the Grove. I thought Jack Campbell's house was the Grove. Huh? What? You better get with it like I said. No wonder the people out there are starting to turn on you. No wonder Greg hates you like poisons. Okay, let me. The tavern. Thank you very much. Thank you Carlos. Carlos, do that. He looked it up. Oh, he looked it up. Oh, he didn't cheating. That's cheating. Chaining. Chaining Carlos. This is one of my clients. Chaining. Chaining Carlos. This is one of my clients. Put the big DQ next to his paycheck. Oh, today's payday by the way. Haven't seen Clarence yet with a paycheck or maybe a bonus check, which may or may not be in today. Haven't seen Carl. Him with anything. Which of course, that's the, that's when he becomes our hero. Clarence is on payday, or at least mine. Haven't seen him yet. So I'm off. Had his leather jacket on. He's getting ready for his big debut of penis talk this Sunday at 6 to midnight. Let's see. I'm going to vote for one. I'll just vote for one for fun. Okay, not that it makes any difference. Just to get it started. So I can see what's going on. The pull is up on the arraggies.com. This is the final run off. And what we're going to do is whichever business wins, we're going to like we build it. Huh? I think that's a great idea. Don't you like that? With your money. No, I would buy money with my precious money. With Rimmer's money. Look, look at that. It's up. Eastern Airlines got a pair of unos pizzas got to. And it's just when up there moments ago. I'm not telling you why voted for. I didn't just put punch one. Vouchers proposed to reduce class sizes Governor says it's cost effective. Yeah. Sinking a dramatic expansion of one of the most controversial measures of his administration. Governor Jevster Bush proposed yesterday allowing local school districts to offer private school vouchers to students that overcrowded classrooms. Is this what the people voted for in that amendment? No. Is there any relationship to what they voted for? No. It's a cost effective way of dealing with this issue. He said many districts won't take it. But so what? Scrum is what I guess he meant. The option ought to be there for them to consider. The politically charged proposal which drew immediate fire from Democrats in the sponsor of the class size measure US representative Kendrick Meek was just one of more than a dozen suggestions of the governor media today is he unveiled a vision of how the state should move ahead on the class cap measure. If there was any evidence of a devious plan as he referred to before the election to undermine class size, this would be one of them. A quick senator Debbie Wasserman Schultz Democrat of Pembroke Pymns. It's totally inappropriate to empty classrooms by sending kids to private schools. That is not what the voters voted for under any stretch. So there you go again. And you people wanted a man you put him right back in there. He told you was going to do this. He told you was going to stick into eating. Give it to him. What you voted on it amendment. He over. This is the education governor. And the public they just can't. They can't handle. Man. Who would know how does he kid. Evidently a lot of folks. Because it's bush country. In fact, I think bomb Graham auto one for governor and president. You put you this hard put back together again. Don't you governor senator and president because senator he'll keep up what's his name. Mayor Pingo Picania governor we can get with a jab bush and then no for all president. He can only hit three orifices all at once. And with those BDIs his man he could scare him all in the shape. 927 at 560 WCM and he left the house this morning freezing your ass off. Do you know how dirty your car was? You didn't have time to wash it. No so-called car washes it gas stations just can't get it done right. Well, here's a great idea for it. Take. Keep up what's his name. Mayor Pingo Picania governor we can get with a jab bush and then no for all president. He can only hit three orifices all at once. And with those BDIs his man he could scare him all in the shape. 927 at 560 WCM and the wife of president of the house for a presidential lead. As with strong his name under pressure after characterizing the disease as he gave play along with other anti-homosexual statements. The administration had chosen Jerry Thacker to serve on the presidential advisory commission on HIV and AIDS. He was to be sworn in along with a new commission members next week by HHS services secretary. Cheesehead Tommy Thompson. Yesterday however Thacker was sending a letter signally he would not accept the appointment administration official said, Why not wait to hear this? Why not press secretary Ari Fleisher while need a confirming or denying the withdrawal? It should have stern rebuked a factory statements. The views that he holds are far far remote from what the president believes Fleisher said. The president has a total opposite view. The president's view is that people will need to be treated with caring compassion. How do you like that? Thacker, a graduate of Bob Jones University has found over the Septer Institute and one point is biography on the Septer website refer to AIDS as the gay plague in alcohol's AIDS a plague. Thacker's referred to gay people as practicing a death style rather than lifestyle and is described homosexual abuse a sin that can be cured by Christianity. Yati, yati, yati, yati. There you go, but the good news is he's out. Oh! Because the heat got turned up too high. You know what I'm saying? And I replaced your rubbed his bald spot and said, Ah, they did us! Did he not us? Is it back up yet or not? Yes, yes. Oh, why didn't you tell me that all the quiet reading? What are reading? I was much more enjoying out of the corner. You think I can't see Tom Brady's crotch out of the corner of my eye? While I'm reading at the same time? Oh, no, what do you don't read stuff on here? We saw the fact that you're boring. It's 24-10 at 5-16 WQA and what's in and Tom the Rose if you keep talking. She's not going to listen. Maybe we can send Tom to Rose to the Emerald Coast, although I wouldn't wish that on them. But if you're not on the Emerald Coast, you'll see a lot of big tubby fat people in there. But you'll also see skinny people and medium people. All kinds of people with just a great appetite for delicious good food. Any buffet you go to does always big rotundescusting, you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. I mean enormous people. Like Zack for example. Start your mouth water yet. Don't be picking on Zack? Are you start kind of making other Zack attack? Who's going to get it in the back if you don't watch it? Start your mouth watering your spirits with six different kinds of soups you can have some of them all of them whatever you want.

Oh, look at what the pool is already. Georgia, I don't want to tip off anybody that there might be a crank vote on there so far. But you told me these are the finals final after a tremendous an exhaustive pit of research on our part. What's your favorite software business that's no longer around?

The steely tell his futures so they can vote 10, 20, 30 times for the tourists. We got real tourists because they're eight no more tourists. That's what they're saying in the grove even the glamour saying that. Very important facts. Oh yeah Jerry Spinger says he's considering one for the US Senate. Good luck for him. Jerry Spinger for the Senate. Oh did you see Spigano above his are people on TV because as soon as that thing, Jerry Spinger think of Oprah for some strange reason. You know it's like afternoon crap that's on here. Did you see the store and CBS news about the fat free gene? And the mice? Fat free jeans? Fat free jeans. Is that's gonna wear them? Nope. On one leg. Poor Zach. Watch your back Zach. Because from what I'm hearing somebody's orchestrating a Zach attack. Oh, but I get some damn good guest under you know what I'm saying? Pat Riley. Rick Riley. The life for Riley? What was his name? Bill Bindex. What was his name on the Shachester of Peach? Chester something Riley. Okay. Way before you were both. Oh no. But long before you were born. And his wife's name was Peg. Anyway, you didn't see the story, but it's incredible. It's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. For years we've been watching with Larmaz Americans have gotten bigger and bigger and bigger and faster like Zach. The rest of the, Dyer warnings about heart disease and diabetes have done a little put it in the National Lappetite and public health experts are at loss at what to do. They're running around like Al Martino. What am I gonna do? And people are slapping when they face. Now listen to this. As CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Kellon reports, researchers at Boston, Jossland Diabetes Center may have the answer. They figured out ways to let mice eat all they want while staying slimming avoiding diabetes and they'll be moderate the same time. And they showed the mice. They showed one of the disease here. They showed the fat, not he wasn't that big, but they showed the fat mouse. They'll kind of like fat boy. And then they showed the very slim trim mouse. And they were eating the same amount. Eating like nonstop. Dr. Ronald Conlow, the research discovered that by knocking out a gene in the mice that controls fat storage, the mice can eat all day long without gaining an ounce. Are you hurtin' at? You can eat all day long. Oh, right Zach is doing there without gaining an ounce. Now I don't want to say that any of us are gluttones. Although some of us absolutely are. And if we ever think it would ever do something like inject like a little genetic engineering in us. Huh? Right. Like, from little splice in our, Wherever they stick it. And then we can do that. Well, what a, just a prospect of that. I go for bananas split right now. Of course, I think it's too late for me. I think what you're already diabetic. You might have a little problem on that. Probably. So like I said, I'll just have the ice cream part. And so they invented cure for that with stem cell research. Oh, yeah. Well, we're not gonna have stem cell research under this bunch. We got in there right now because the Lord don't like that stuff. Okay? The fetus hugger is very angry about that. And so I'll present it to you, of course, as controlled. Manipulated lock stock and bagels by the, right, Wingers he ain't gonna allow that. And Christopher Reeve ain't too happy about it. It said the difference is striking between the mice and their siblings. What are which has been genetically altered and one not? And did we mention about the third baby? The press conference in Toronto, then in Japan, We got a third clone baby. Anybody seen it? Anybody believe it? No. It says, of course, like a calorie free dessert, it sounds too good to be true. The research is after all only in mice, but even obesity experts like Dr. Lewis Aronis say the fine of Gajayne's away. We think about the causes of weight gain. What the study tells us, and then listen to that as very carefully, what the study tells us is that the key factor is how much fat you store, not how much you eat, says Dr. Aronis. Dr. Cong believes there's no reason we can't alter the same genes and people offer a new treatment for the obese. I told you the problem is not eating too much. We need new genes. We need new genes, Mr. And for new genes, we go to the goddamn Madsagras. Now, I'm Milsot, let's mall. Why do people go to their place? I have no idea. I can't for the life of me because they like to walk. Because they like to walk. Well, that's what exercise anyway. You park about two miles away, then you walk inside. And it's kind of fruitless because there's about E2 food courts. So when you go inside, you put all the weight on your, you see what I'm saying?

Actually, no, it was a 441 North of Miramar Parkway called Keel's bakery. Did anybody mention that? Keel's bakery. You could sit when you could go in eat breakfast there and they had a bakery and they're also in like when you were in a couple of factions about that. But nobody ever said what was they said Keel was but I don't think they are designated bakery and I still don't know what it was. It was a restaurant also and they would like when you sit down to eat breakfast and have all be, you know, like extra stuff they bring you from the bakery. It's just like the much on why you're waiting for your food. Excellent. Yeah. That's probably what they're all doing this. And what about a country walk? Is that still down there? A country walk? I think a hurricane Andrew blew away. Okay. I thought country walk is like a development. Yeah, I think the hurricane Andrew ruined the whole development. Yeah. So I missed that place. How about the morons? Have you seen that? I know there's a moron since I know this got to be a moron since. Well, you used to eat at one of those. Well, before you get so adamant about it, I want you to find me worse, okay. I'll look it up and I'll call you back. Thanks. Bye. Neil. The name of the places I like it like that. That's where it's at. By Chris Kenner. Remember that song? Yep. You do? Sure. That's shocking to me. That is amazing. Inspector fired over comments about immigrants. Somebody just asked me this. All I could have had morons in this cafeteria was taken over by the Piccadilly cafeteria. See, that explains it. So I guess what used to be that morons in this now is the Piccadilly cafeteria but it still qualifies morons because it's gone. It's gone. Just like Union 76 gas. Gone. I like to big orange ball. They had with the blue letters. Remember that? Union 76? You don't? Oh, the gas station. Yeah. The station. It was like an orange thing. Sure. Big ball. They used to have a big orange ball. And they would make those available for your antenna. Remember? Well, that's right. You could think big orange balls on your antenna. Bye. Bye. Then low. This is 420560. You wait a few a year. Do you fudge back him? Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story. We take a good, art, stiff look into starter. She had a statement to make. Unfortunately, she was a woman. She was Meredith Brooks. It's really about being a strong woman. But this is a sexist world. If a woman behaves aggressively, she's a bitch. But if a man behaves aggressively, but no one wanted to hear what Meredith Brooks had to say. Oh, I see. Well, this is nothing new. Men are very threatened by a woman who hasn't been married. If they have fault men were threatened by her. But really knew that she was just overcoming, sitting for lesbian tendencies. Oh, come on. Don't even go. That's okay. We like the pretty lesbians. Oh, wow. What if Meredith Brooks had get an arm at a land as Morris said? Oh, yeah. Why you? Zarrette Brooks. Maybe she came on too strong. But I haven't been. She'd been a little more lady like you know, this is life's a bitch. It's a big juicy, stopping went look at show business tonight on inside the behind. 15 to five, 16 to WQM of British radio stations in court as we speak for running a competition during which four listeners suffered severe frostbite. Just like Carlisle must have sleeping over the underpasser under the overpass last night. During the coolest seats in town challenge by BRNB station in Birmingham, Central England, four listeners competed to see who could sit on dry ice for the longest time. Boy talk about having a cold. Back to him. As they suffered frostbite permanent scarring and were hospitalized, they spoke swimming for the safety watchdog which brought the prosecution told writers. The temperature of the dry ice frozen carbon dioxide was minus 78 centigrade. You said, minus 78 centigrade. You know what that is? A lot. minus 166 Fahrenheit. Close. Jesus. That's even a little colder than it was in Miami last night. The price for the contest held in August 2001 was tickets to party in the park a music festival. Talk about having your cheeks frozen together. Seriously, you probably have to thaw them out to take a good even a bad one. The health and safety executive said the radio station could face a fine about to 20,000 pounds if found guilty in the magistrate's court. The station has run several publicity stunts in the past which are house controversy or as they see over their controversy. They say that controversy. One from our slide, the two strangers getting married when he cash an exotic honeymoon in the use of it upmarket flat. The competition prompted criticism from church groups which had it to mean the dignity of marriage vows. Ah, geez. Sure, as fire's inspector from our so-called non-cubans. How do you like them? Apple. The one we'd be unlucky. A Miami-Shore's building department official will complain about the influx of immigrants in South Florida to a Harold Colness has been fired, village officials say, the F today. A January 21th column by Jim DeFeed, he described in the counter at Village Hall in which building inspector Charlie Esher, blamed Cuban and other immigrants for South Florida's political corruption as well as the demise of the Orange Bull parade. Those comments by the civil complaints of the villager, and Esher was fired that day. He was fired for the unfortunate comments he made the Mr. DeFeedy village manager Thomas Benton said. Esher was worked for the city since 2000 in months that he thinks the city overreacted me a violated the civil rights. I don't think I should get fired for giving an opinion. He said, I personally don't hate anybody. I deal with Cubans all the time. They don't have any problem with me. Hey, look at me. I got to him sitting right across the window. Some of your co-workers. Yeah. But I do get up selling people or immigrants of any sort. Don't learn to speak English. There we go. Now we're talking. He's got a stomach on it. He says, the more we diversify the language, the less we communicate with each other. Esher acknowledged criticizing the role of Cubans in the cancellation of the parade, but said his comments were misconscrewed by the Fidi. What I said was that since the parade is no more, the Cubans didn't support revitalizing. He said, but the way he rearranged my words maybe he looked like a total bigot. Sounds to me like a good lawsuit there Mr. Esher, wherever the hell you are. See we thought Jim DeFeedy was a good guy. Remember I knocked him yesterday before we knew about this story? Come to turn out he's just another faker. If he was so good, what's he doing to the Harold? We're going to talk today about ozone and how it kills you according to Georgia. I just got in my mail yesterday, which I ordered a couple weeks ago. Three biosone air purifiers. With ozone, and they have the blue light in there, the blue poison light. And I have MR on in my bedroom. There's one of the dining room and I'm one of my family room. Not where you sit so you're like breathing and you can smell the ozone. And I thought this is great to like clean up the air and more healthy. And George tell me, oh, you're going to die ozone. We're going to kill you. Boys and gas. When you're Jewish, you kind of used to that, the poison gas. Figure sooner or later. And especially with this crowd, we got up there now, you know. Poison gas, man. So maybe somebody wants to give us some advice about that, about biosone and other ozone filters as opposed to negative ion filters, which I think is what I really wanted in the first place. And I wound up with this. The ones that definitely are supposed to be crap are hippo filters. Right. They don't have it at all. And we can wait till you. We're now where did you find this? Somebody facts this to us? The Center for Science and the Pupic Interest. See, this is the better homes in Garden stuff. I caution you that. But you're going to get upset anyway. You'll get real upset, which is good. 10 foods you should never eat and 10 super foods that you should eat. You'd be shoveling them in your post. I don't see exact shoveling any of the good stuff in this post when I walk around that thing in a morning there to go take a leak. He's in her shovel and all kinds of fatnings. So bacon and eggs and butter and lard and uh, halavah. Here are the 10 super foods you should well. Let me first give you the ones you should never eat. 1. Quaker 100% natural oats and honey granola. Do you eat that? No. Well, that's good. Maybe that's why you're still here right now. Why haven't I held a time with this thing today? Get the honey tune. Yeah. Does mother nature want you eating half a cup of oats covered with three teaspoons of sugar and laden with more artery clogging fat that you get in the McDonald's hamburger? No do you prefer you eat low fat, lower sugar whole grain of bran cereals? Like Kellogg's complete wheat bran flakes. We these Kellogg's all brand post-un%, percent brand shredded wheat oatmeal or wheat Tina. Oh, we Tina. Fat. If you're stuck on vanilla and sugar at least two is a product or quaker 100% natural low fat vanilla with raisins, forget about natural oats and honey vanilla. Okay, forget it. Okay. The honey tune. Yeah. Number two, bugles. Bugles. Let me take a call from Hollywood. These people are going to get upset. Hollywood, hello. Good morning. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Do you remember the Viking? The Viking? Yeah. No. On US1 and the Griffin Road? What was it? It was a big restaurant. It was torn down when they started the airport expansion. The Viking restaurant? I'll be damned. You remember that? Nine never heard of it. Oh, all these places up there on US1 in front of the airport with a storm down. Yeah. The bowling alley. Okay. I think you were for it. Thank you. Some of y'all just came in there. Did you redo these? What is that? Just took away the promos. And he said, here's a new promos for the homo. What do you say? I do. I look at it first. And then I'll decide. Join QM tomorrow. Ten to noon at the Brazile Goph Academy of 2250 South Park Road and Hellnare for the buck of all Superb bulls throughout for a dollar a ball hit for a dollar a ball. See there's no punctuation in here, Schmuck. Put like a little line. Know that you don't do that in this fun. You old but like a little comma. If he had a little comma sense, for a dollar a ball hit a floating bulls I went his and his Corvets. So that's enough to get you out there. Anyway, I'm sure my gal will be there on that one. Probably drive on those Corvets. I'll be able to see it no more. And you're doing your new to do what we already did. That's the same thing. Those signs. We'll talk about that more later on. We'll discuss it more. By the way, don't forget about that Zack attack. Keep your eye peeled for it. What do they call that throwing caution to the winds? Is that what they call that? Right. So in the old cliche, I have no idea what that means. But we're just putting the word out there. Okay. So that's some big fat tub that works in here. It's not a bad guy in between the B.M.s. And boy, he takes a lot of men there in the morning. Oh. If I go in there, if I go in there, take a leak, I can handle it when Carlos is in there brushing his teeth and bathing in the sink. I, you know, I'm just pretending he's not there. But when big Zack and it's always him, he's always the one that's in there. And when he eats that much, you have to do that a lot. And I just run out of there. Buegels number two don't every Buegels. Mmm. Buegels. Because they rust sometimes. Tartish. What's so bad about Buegels? The high saturated coconut oil that general mills fries them in oil that's at least twice as saturated as large. Chips are usually fried in corn, soy or canola oils. One serving just to work up at these fried wonders will give you 40% of your daily name of the saturated fat. If you're looking for a low fats, that give big Buegels a shot or try big low fat tortilla chips made by Tostitos or guiltless gourmet. You like to guiltless gourmet the baked number three. How's anybody calling about my ozone filters? There's a huh? Yeah. Well why not? I don't know. I'm looking for a little bit of advice here from somebody in the Sonny and so might know something about that besides you just saying that the ozone's going to kill me. That's not sufficient. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Hey, good morning. Where is the? How about Mary's Italian restaurant? Mary's was great on 441 in North Miami. I think we had that on there. Yeah.

Thanks for the good news. Also, you mentioned Hollywood squares last summer. Yeah. And there's a connection between Hollywood squares and Robert Blake. Him and uh, Wally Cox. They used to be best friends. Yeah. And Robert Blake was on the tonight show with Johnny Carson. I got a church relax and was talking about Wally Cox advised him to get married. Mm-hmm. And Robert Blake said, well, what if I get tired of the woman? And Wally Cox said, go ahead and just shoot her. Really? That was on Johnny Carson. About two years after Wally Cox died. Mm-hmm.

What was that? You got me? Oh, maybe we'll have to hear the whole thing. Oh, later. Number three McDonald's Bigel Breakfast sandwiches. It's not the Bigels in these sandwiches that'll get in trouble. It's the fillings. The worst is the Spanish omelet. But that sounds good. It's Spanish omelet. Bigel that sounds good. Mm-hmm.

If you want to have a breakfast under the Golden Archas try the hotcakes with syrup or low fat April apple brand muffin and said the hotcakes with syrup are good. Who wrote this?

I'm gonna die from the ozone layer or the ozone or the bux on which we've had no calls about that and that just pisses me off I admit that I can't be an expert on anything or everything I've been old hockey names and aren't is racing but other than that that's all I know So when it comes to trying to like purify the ear a little bit These are uh, you know, especially with all the allergens here in south float Which I'm getting sick and tear to that crap the malla luka's exactly which I spent a lot of money Give her those malla luka's years ago and help the little bit poison spores right that's right And of course don't forget we're didn't all start like all the other bad things I'm talking about no less than I'm sure right.

We're fascinated by a chain. Oh, don't we know stupid books? All I wanted was a thing. The fact of marriage in way. Everybody's turning blind. Yes. I'm dying of a hair. You know, how come you didn't warn me about those on filters? For the stuff that Carlos just gave me, all I can say is. Wow. I wonder if I feel scrappy, which I really don't. But now that you've brought me this, psychosomatic illnesses will start creeping in. Wow. This is horrible. I wonder what we want to talk to me about that. Because if you like this, weight it all at money. I'm three of them no less. The decreases in lung function. Aggravation of asthma, which I don't have. Throw it irritation in cough. Yeah. And this is just the beginning. This is just the beginning of the list. There's like about 650 things on here of why you probably shouldn't be having like ozone sit right next to your post. You know what I'm saying? Chest pain and shortness of breath. Information of lung tissue. Higher susceptibility of respiratory infection. Man, this would be bad. I'll bring one in. I know where I can put it. You know what I'm saying? This is from the EPA, the environmental protection agency. So I don't know whether we can believe them or not. But they sure have nothing. Nothing good to say about ozone ear purifiers. Nothing. And I love you. You can't believe the people selling them. Well, I know that. See, I think I screwed up. Because there's 50 million different ear purifiers on the net. And I think I got to wrong ones anyway. It's the ionizer. The negative ionizer is recommended by the MSNBC. Yes. I think that's the one I wanted. That's the one you wanted. But how about what Carlos was talking about before the sharper image. I would just see the advertising on TV. But that's not know it's not. Well, it is a principle. It is a negative ion thing. But different model same concept, same process. Is that's the tall one that you don't change the filter. You just pull the insert the same strips out. Why you shmere off. Yeah. That's what you want. Or do you know how am I going to get those? I'm not going to sharp a image. Pat twice as much as you would need to. I think I can find them online. Wow. Yeah. And these I guess we're going to have to bring them to the station. And place them around. Yeah. Put one in the sales department would be good. Maybe one in the during certain parts of the day. Well, that's bad news. Thanks Carlos for warning me because as soon as I got home, I'm going to unplug those pieces of crap. She had tried to do something good. Just like to think with the food.

Which is in hell with the. That's what. That's a button on the beaches and wasn't for a lottery of the other one. Don't know if it would. Or am I thinking of Penrod's? No, I'm not thinking of Penrod's. The button on or my second of the elbow room. Maybe. Was that it for on our list? The elbow room. He thinks of anything. So one. Well, I mean, we only had about 40 million of them. They're how now we supposed to remember. Do it over again. Anyway. Yeah, let's start again. What do you say? Good idea. Nissen Cups Noodles and Shrimp with Six Foods. You should never eat number seven. And you just will listen to me. French fries at Burger King. I don't go. If you stop slapping your whole family to Burger King. I'll have to. God. I've been telling you that for about 50 or 20 years. Burger King makes some of the worst French fries you can buy it a fast food restaurant. This says, thanks to the salty coating that allows more oil to be absorbed. The King size order packs 590 calories and 30 grams of fat. 12 of them saturated fat. That's worth the McDonald's. Super size fries more than half the bad fat. You shouldn't have had a whole day. So Cups at Burger Ham and Tony that man Burger and those onion rings. If you if we fight out to eat, we're trying to make line rings at Burger King, we're going to report you the CIA. Okay. We've had it. I mean, those aren't even guy minitos. That's a purposed excuse for on your hand. Where the hell's our chek? Are they playing some kind of game with us today? It's ten to eleven, those checks were do like almost two hours ago. Because that's a deal on this show. And it gives to be paid a, and the little hand hits to the big benefits of being out in a clock. It's like it's the organ grinder with his monkey, you know. You keep putting him money and it keeps grind it out. Otherwise. We just dummy up. Number eight. Oh, this is amusing, is hell. And not only that, but guess what other kind of soup George had in here, which he gave me, that one and I spit it right out and threw it away. And there's a little member of the kind of soup he had. So the brand name was the brand name. Very good. It was Campbell's well. Number eight worst foods that you should never eat. Campbell's written white label condensed soups. Well, it wasn't that. Yeah. It would know it was condensed stuff. Something rhymes with soup. Like poop. It was those. It was a horrible. It was a horrible. That's kind. Well, what is the big smile on this man? What kind of a silly ass outfit is that? What does that say on? There's not a Marlon thing. Dito's National Championship. 2000's. Well, like I said, the price of toasted, those instead of those damn vehicles. Okay, matches. In fact, where's the chance? Where's the chance? Where's the chance? Where's the chance? He's going down. He's going to go fat. Get with it. We used to like you a lot, but now we're starting to think. And it's pretty bad. That outfit is not going to get you laid this week and believe me. That's that's silly. What does it say? Brimming with salt. That's the problem with Campbell's man. Half a can averages about 1100 milligrams of sodium that's almost half your ideal daily quota. Half a can. Try brands like healthy choice in Campbell's healthy request, which have less than half as much sodium as Campbell's regular soups. You can also check out lower sodium dried soup cups by fantastic foods or health valley or the big valley with what's your name? The Far bestado. Far bestand with very good. But along the Diky side. Number nine. We only have two to go. Then we'll get to the good stuff, which nobody's going to want to eat any of this stuff. Number nine lays wow potatoeships. Wow. These chips like fat prepingals are fried in only a less rough. Oh no. The indigestible fat substitute. Oliene doesn't provide any calories, but many people causes gastrointestinal symptoms. Some people have said it's suffered severe such severe cramps or diarrhea. They had to go to the emergency room. Oliene also grants the bodies of absorption of cartanoids. These products won't do much to help you lose weight of reduce your risk of heart attack. But my cause you lose a lot of my cause you're a lot of misery instead by baked potato or tortilla chips. What? How you had baked? Yes, I like those a lot. And I'm supposed to be a lot. You're wrong. You're wrong. You're wrong. Baked potatoeships are delicious. But wrong. Look, you just bug off. Okay. This is not your topic car. I don't know anything was food. In fact, a factor in with him is not too happy about it. No, don't help me. No, because you ought to be in the same well of Carlos agrees with George and George really must be full of crap. Probably from all that missing cup noodles he's eating with or without his shrimp. It's not the shrimp that's good for it. It's those noodles. I understand that. It's that palm artery clogging palm oil. Don't you feel like like like that? Or just knowing and he every day that we don't have food running he eats that stuff. So I guess we're going to have that food come in. How about some bacon? I would like some bacon. I bet you had some bacon two strips, two little tiny thin strips. That's a meal is two strips of bacon. Are you at your mind? I bet you Wayne Arnold's got some good bacon. Don't do it. See, I'd be okay for us for the hot sauce. That's what gives me the green apple first step. So they would stop doing that. Don't do one. What? Carlos wants it. Yeah, the food too. He wants it. He wants it. Be food. In fact, I think that Clorissa that if he could get it, he'd bring the Jackson here. The food that is he can't get nothing else. And that's it. I mean, he's not, you know, he's just kind of a goofy guy. It's the sports nerd part. That's why he can't get laid. See, the the bras out there that like the, they like the Jax not not the sports nippers. They like the Jax, the Tom Brady's the Ray Whittley's. They like those guys. The Marty have last. Yeah, who didn't play last night Atlanta. I guess I got a bonus. Marty playing here. They've been at complain Atlanta last night. I couldn't make it. He was a little sore. But they're not into the Jax sniffers. I mean, like Josh Friedman, you think he's getting any? Yeah, the wife, you know. You didn't know. Josh Friedman has a wife. Josh obviously has nasal passages that have been removed surgically. One fortunately has limited eyesight. Josh Friedman has a wife. Yeah, you have to be absolutely bullshitting me. Josh Friedman has a wife. I wouldn't Josh do you? A thing like that. I mean, fat boys got a wife, but of course his wife also weighs about 400 pounds. So what's the big deal? But Josh for at least fat boy don't smell bad. Didn't have a stomach stapled. I ought to have. We ought to have his whole body stapled like from the neck down would be good. Yeah, like from where the food like from where all that cavern and stuff just started Josh Friedman's got a freaking wife. Yeah, I can't get out. I can blow bubbles at him. I know. And the boxes that produce you. I didn't do it, but I know what they do. His hair, his ears are oozing down. There's even like fence. And then fat men show, will they do? Do. And just your body. Shut around by sin, never know my duty. Get in the skin. But every once been stuck in the skin. Watch through hallway sideways. And he's covered with gaure love. And I'm a shesky dog pair. He's such a handsome young man. He's freezing the roll. We're not too short. We're going on that. Stay away from me. Josh Friedman. Yeah, we'll think he money, but he's no stand-in. Don't come near me. Josh Friedman. He's the ladies and I'm not even a cellified sound. He's dead. Got so fat he's got six loaded. Stealing wretched by long-over's a room. There's staples up and down his roof. Just to hold in all that crazy old fool. Stay away from me. Josh Friedman. Okay, you think I care if this one's all likely. I think he does. Don't come near me. Josh Friedman. Come here, come here. Don't wish to like throw them to his head. There's a deal with some old people. You made that up. You didn't verify it with the other Josh when he was in there? He was the busy guy to move my check. Thanks a lot, Clarence. We love Clarence. He's the best. He could not get laid. Available scientific evidence shows that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone has little potential to remove indoor air contaminants. Oh, I bet you had. That's news to me. I thought that it actually did something while it was killing you. Oh, my God. Is it messes up your throat and your respiratory, etc. And it says, why would the elbow run have been on your list? It's still there. Get out a little bit, Georgian Carlos. Well, first of all, it's not in Hollywood, so George wouldn't be there. And Carlos can't afford to go. What did they correct me for? I didn't say it was out of business. Yeah, you did. No, I didn't. If I weren't you the one that brought it up? No. Oh, I'm not used to what George said was he wish he had a little more elbow room in there, which is why Carlos got up and ran out. I think that's just never Carlos parted real bad. Hadn't Sarah Soda makes a little bit of an effort. This is a little bit lame and very old, but it's kind of cute. And it is Friday.

Sure, what does that take that off in an area if that's not too much work for it? Wait a minute, I'll go. It's Mickey's on the beach now. Ah, no Penn Rises. Like I said, leave it on there, don't get so carried away. Right? Right. Leave it on, please. Pretty pleased. It's still called Penn Rises, Judy and Miguel Kim in your ver. Just bet out of shape. I mean, I haven't seen a net pissed off since Dreen tried to put a move on him. Huh? Yesterday. Seriously, he was like really pissed off and indignant, Judy. Don't get Miguel pissed off, he won't give you any. Put Patricia Murphy's restaurant as well. They were going to be here more in dear field beach. Hey, well, maybe if Judy sends a picture, you might think about it. Send her someone an envelope. Uh, do you, I remember Patricia Murphy's, but I remember those locations. What is it? Put it in the safe side right there. What is it called now? Nikki's on the beach is in Penn Rises entertainment complex. Nikki's on the beach is getting ready for the first time. You're not, don't start that now. All of a sudden, I want to be a big shot. Oh, brother, should've heard the argument going on as if it matters, as if anybody cares. Well, we'll get to the definitive answer from the people in the audience. What does he know? He's taught us before with the tavern. It's tourists. Well, it begins with the C.A. Huh? He's a full of it, man. I'll tell you, what a guy that drinks rippled by the gallon under the overpass. I guess he had to stay warm last night. We'll find out from these people. Here's Pompano. Hello. You know how you doing? I was calling about the air filters, but you mentioned the baked potato chips. Yeah. You should check those out because that's one of those foods that they add sugar to to boost the flavor. Well, I'm not saying that I eat. I have tried them. I'm not saying I'm sitting home eating them all because I can't get that crap anyway, but as far as the tastiest is going to, I think they're great. Enjoy that. You honestly, the look. A little Georgia's giving me like, you know, to ride. I think they're good. This is one of those things that you should get to boost the flavor. You had mentioned the air filters from By ozone. Yeah. But the shop ravaged. Right. We were thinking, we have a couple of those. My girlfriend bought them. Right. And in the booklet, when we got them, there was a warning that they do produce ozone as a byproduct. Uh-huh. So I asked my cardiologist about it. And he said, as, you know, if you have a healthy heart, it's a trivial amount of ozone. If you had a severe heart condition, it could be something that would be a factor. They wouldn't want you to stretch your heart with. Oh, so. But the thing that bothers me is the thing in a CPA where it says it has ozone has little ability to remove any contaminants from the, so what's the point? This, this, this is ozone is a byproduct of these ones from sharp image. It doesn't use ozone the clean air. Right. It uses some kind of electrostatic ionizing thing. Right. But a byproduct of this stuff being cleaned is ozone. So, I know if you were concerned about ozone, you should look at the book, but if anyone there even buys it. I'm going to go home and throw them in a swimming pool. So it's a good home. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the bad news. There you go. Got ripped off again. It was only 700 bucks for three of them. Uh-uh. I got two big fat checks in my pocket. Now, what are you worrying about? Clarence was in. Oh, no way. Carl Scott, his check. I got mine. How's your contract coming? What? I said, that's bad. You know, come on, Greg. Quit playing hard to ask. Quit playing hard to get. Okay. Playin' what his guy's emotions. All he keeps doing is stalling and stalling. From one pay period of the, and of course, I'll never make it retroactively. What's supposed to have started on the 15th? No. 15th of what? Exactly. 15th of January 2007. Oh, you only problem with that is that we'll be out of here by 2007. Or sooner. 10 super foods you should eat. Ready? Okay. And of course, this is good. It's very timely since it was 100 below zero last night. By the way, it's pretty cold folks. Watch it. Fundal up, put on a jacket. Put on a sweater. Get your goolashes out. Be sure and get out that scraper. Man, so you can get the ice off your windshield in the morning. Shovel. People it out of my window. What is wrong with this town? What is wrong with a media here? They're crazy people. And of course, don't we have to see the story about the cloning again about the, uh, if you have any idea how those people must be laughing. How, how I stay with those people are laughing. Yeah, the railions, the illegal railions. I wouldn't be surprised by Monday. We got like 75,000 more babies as they can do it. Why can't we? Sure. We're going to clong guilty. We're going to have a whole bunch of little squeaky babies running around. But if I thought maybe that my wife just had that was a clone. Those little babies from passions that we don't see anymore. I guess they figured we're boring and they wrote them off the show. Those little babies Samantha was trying to catch. What does that mean? What does that mean? What does that mean? Okay. So I'm saying if it's right or just get, protect those oranges. Protect your fruits up there and settle Florida. Because you know, I want to get this spruled. I like oranges. In fact, the balance for life. One of the things you'll find in there. Two things that they put with the entree sliced up oranges or strawberries. Or sometimes just at orange. Or sometimes blueberries. Or once in a while, a little plum. which I do like a plum. Plums are good. Number two, see what can agree on that one. You're not going to get too happy. Number two, whole grain bread. It's higher in fiber about it as in vitamins and minerals than in rich white bread or wheat bread. Also look for whole grain crackers like the Biscoe Trisket. A TASKETA Trisket for you? That's what I love Trisket. That in this because it says it here on an afferst of wine. This is from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which I have no idea who those people are. I'm talking with the council. Excuse me, which is bad for you. Number three, canlope, which I do like. Canlope has some of this morning. A quarter of a delicious melon supplies almost as much vitamin A and see as most people leave an entire day. A, canlope, good for our like it. Four, which you'll be very upset about. Broccoli. Lots of vitamin C, cart noise and folic acid. I love broccoli. I can't even imagine. That's another thing balanced for life uses a lot. When you have like somebody neat dishes or something, there's some real good steamed broccoli in there. And I think it's good about their vegetables as they're like lightly steamed and not like that. That is good. That's good. That's good. That's like my mother likes to like her asparagus. Yeah, I mean funny. She likes to feed me asparagus because it makes your piece smell bad. That's the only reason she could make cattle. She could make broccoli. She could make, what's the other one? Colour flar. I like all those things. You're giving me a bad look on cauliflower. Have you ever had a cauliflower with cheese, the frozen? Or cauliflower? Yeah. Good cheese? No. You like it. Never had it. Colour flar. It stinks to what it's cooking it stinks. And cabbage, cooked cabbage, Brussels sprouts. You don't like Brussels sprouts. I love Brussels sprouts. Especially the baby or the one. Oh, those are good. No wonder your hair is like silver and brittle. Don't breathe on him to our little, his hair will crumble like dust. I'm serious. You can see how brittle it is. Well condition my ass is brittle. I can see it from in here. Too bad I don't have any hair for you to see. Number five sweet potatoes. Although I do need a haircut real bad. Yeah, I'm literally looking. I'm getting shaggy and I'm reluctant to get one here because I got a great barber and Toronto. And the barber I got here is good, but he's there. Why is asses in there? Why is there? Why? I don't like their attitude. I say. Now I pointed this off the ear. The barber for the haircut there is 10 bucks. Okay. Now they got the one barber who I guess is the head cheese, the big head, the head of the cut. And when I leave I give a you got supposed to pay the guy in the end. So I give a $20 bill and he's supposed to give 10 bucks to the other guy. Oh, a bill. And I don't like that. It's like I'm trying to be a big shot. I'm just trying to leave an ice tip for a good job. That'll learn that. Money bucks is not a lot for a haircut. What does that's whole? Yeah, exactly. Now the guy that cuts my hair. I'm going to put it on the other side. And I don't like that. I'm trying to be a big shot. I'm just trying to leave an ice tip for a good job. Now the guy that cuts my hair. He's appreciative and always comes to the door and waves when I go and thank you very much. But the other guy. Here's the hit. When somebody gives you a tip, you say thank you. Yeah, thank you very much. What a nice guy. Oh, Bill Clinton. Like I say, well, Mr. Big shot. Yeah. I could have had a hell of you. Well, guess what. Screw you, man. That wouldn't that piss you. They done that to me twice. Really. Yeah. Well, that would be nice. Because the other guy gives a real good haircut. That would be it. Everybody's all the way. It's a lot of luck. I got a bar with that. So good. Two guys in there. Either one whichever one. Two or one. We'll go in any younger guy. They're from who knows where. But boy, they give good haircut. But isn't that something you try to be a big tip or you try to be a nice guy? I'm going to get him. Put you down for that. Oh, Bill. Put the on. What people people? Yeah. Put you back on a banana boat. Okay. You asshole. You sleas bag. You greaser. Number five. After broccoli, which we can't talk to our agenda. Sweet potatoes. Yeah. Now can leave those. A nutritional all star though. One of the most nutritious vegetables you can eat. Relative with cartonoid's vitamin C potassium and fiber. Fiber. Mix it on sweeten applesauce or crushed pineapple fresh to moisture and sweetness. Fender. Number six. Watermelon. Really? It's good for you. Excellent source of vitamin C and cartonoid's and a taste grade. Perfect for breakfast, dessert, or a picnic. Sort of wonder about these people. I mean, I like watermelon. Yeah. But I always know what watermelon is just sugar and water. Sugar water. Yeah. How could that be healthy? Number seven. Oh boy. Beans. What are you going? Yeah. That's all your food man is loaded with beans. All you people. That's all you know from his beans. You people has beans. All you people. You people. Jews only beans. Okay. Get filled to fit. No. That's all you eat. You filled to fish. Right. That's right. And look how healthy we are. Beans in expensive low and fat and rich and protein are in full Like acid and fiber choose Garbanzo, Pinto, black, navy, kidney or Yental, lentils. Eat them as a side dish or shenak in a tortilla with salsa or a soup. No. No thanks. Hate beans. Taco Bell I like but always I order is without beans. Please. And if I were to tell you how they do the meat and eat well. He's a beautiful one and no. You don't want to see it. You do not want to see it. Number eight. Sam and a rather fatty fish. No. I take fish or capsules. I take Omega 6-3 whatever it hell is. For years I've taken them. And they're great. You like salmon? Love it. Well you love my sack from balance for life yesterday since I hate fish. Three of the five things in here were like seafood. We're fish. Not seafood but fish. Fish. Fish. If it's fried. You're trying to be smart asses with me over there. Balance for life because Troy, what's his name? Stratford's going to be incompetent. He's going to be real bozo. You'll make a three fats in fish especially fatty. Fresh fish like salmon, sort of fish and rainbow trout and trouser trout. Can I produce the risk of a sudden death heart attack? Well I know which one of those I'll choose. Number nine. I got to do the break. We're going to get to nine and ten. Why this turned out to be great. Where did you get this? Who set this to us? Are you about it? You've got the facts I think. Or you found it? No. The food list. Yeah. But he's many Friday and one meal. What? He's not listening to anything. We're doing. The ten super foods you should eat and ten foods you should never try. You gave me you brought it to me. He didn't bring that in. Who did? The facts machine did. They didn't come in here? No way. I didn't bring it in. So. Twenty seven past eleven and five sixty WQA and if there's snow a, I'll tell you. Could have been so mind me last night. And regardless of what it was, Tom Lehmann and Joe Prieto are buried in something buried in vehicles because the fact we sent how it's so damn any cars. They don't have any place to park him. Even Tom Lehmann had to park cars in his driveway. So now they need to place one in yours. How it is blowing out all the new vehicles regardless of profit including the potty act vibes starting only 13,998 bus gets you up to $5,000 off every GMC on Boinstock. Plus gets 0% of financing up to a $3,000 rebate. Of course, how it is always has got a stupidest gigantic almost endless selection. A pre-owned car's truck's SUVs that you can depend on. No lemons on the lot. Trust me. No fruit. And how it? Vehicles like that like so what you never seen in your life. Credit is a problem for you. If you're a little bit leary going on to the car dealerships lot even because you have such margin or maybe even really bad credit. How it will not worry about that. They'll find a way to get you to deal done. Don't forget right as I speak. It's the winter blues and emergency clearance sale and how it potty act GMC. Who actually when we do the list of places that have around the longest, they'll be right near the top of the list. I'm like all these other 50 million places that are coming gone. How that is still there. 35 years at 134 or one. South Dixie Highway that's US want across from the falls open every day, seven days a week.

It would be quite some lead. Oh. So he's in my day. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. We're a train monkey's eleven thirty three or five sixty. Nobody came here's a very amusing and a very good facts from big aren't even a lot of bad spelling. El Bachiow first in David then moves rest not sure if it's still a run had good food and live jazz. El Bachiow remember that? No. Well that's not a good part. But here's a great line. And I think you say you like salmon. Yeah. Okay. Now you know I hate fish right. I can't and I've told you I can't even stand a smell of fish. Right. Nuscious. Eborsten ozone. I think I'm going to bad headache from that biosone's. Man, am I a moron or what? And I do these things with the best of intention. Is there anything that's for real anymore? No. Is it? Especially if it's on the internet. I guess anything is like a rip off. You know everything's a racket. Everything's a goddamn racket. Forgot to see these at poker Brian's son. But anyway. Also now listen to this. Why do people eat fish and say that was great because it didn't taste fishy. Would you eat a hot dog and say what a good hot dog it was because it didn't taste like a hot dog? Well that's got to be one. I'm going to frame this. I'm putting this up. I'm putting this up. Yeah. I got something forkey for you. In fact, Wayne Arnold's going to be your enemy in Hudson anyway. I'm sure Wayne can't model dog. Oh poor Wayne. Last time he was here he looked. And the first thing you said to me was boy it's really not it's not the fun to get all does it. And I looked at him and I said in your case I guess not. I feel fine except for that ozone. Oh, I'm getting like respiratory. Huh? And you're the one that brought that crap in. He's out of been just fine. Okay. How to be doing just fine. I think I can credit my ozone, my bio zone whatever those damn things are to my little dog. Have it a beautiful bow movement right on my dining room floor overnight. Not mushy not just for the first time in days because he's got a bad liver. My little dog is dying by the way folks. But I see he's dying. I mean we all are but it could be weeks or months he could hang on who knows. It's a prizes. He's got his liver is like like that. But what a beautiful. And I thought to myself, wow I've never been so happy to see on the floor. On the floor is I'm right now. First time in many many days that he's like left be on such beautiful specimens. Very firm you know he's just to kind of just pick up with the toilet paper or paper towel. Did you and you and it's typically say I saved them and I'm bringing them for a. They suck. I'm bringing in here on Mondays Matterfak. Huh? It's kind of a piece offering to one of our friends. Of course. No not hurry. Anyway so what do you eat a hot dog and say what a good hot dog because it didn't taste like a hot dog? What a big Arnie you know something you've sent us a lot of facts is some of them pretty good. Some of them really know what they mean when they say that even though. No I don't. No I don't. No no I don't. A fish isn't fresh than it's that bad kind of fish. And that's what they're referring to. All fish taste like fish. For example tuna in cans either in no frigate about the world is not good but like tuna in water. I like that. And you want to rely because it doesn't take fish. But if you get fresh tuna I mean like a. Oh I am. You want to know why because it tastes like fish though fresh tuna. I am not a fish guy. There are a few things in the world that make me want to gag and fit my guts out more than a smell. The taste will look the roll on the line. I can almost see that I like looking back at me you know. It's like people eat sushi like Greg Reed you know what I'm saying? You know our good friend Greg Reed. Yeah. Who hates who like poison? Sushi man. Look what it's done for him. And Norma can't who used to be fairly you know. And the sharp and not really marginal. But used to be and I was totally lost and why because he keeps having lunches with Greg at the sushi place. I think he did intentionally was a sabotage to where his mental process he's down is that was all the bad pot. Now here's a fact from someone. Oh this is you know who this is from. Do you have ice from? I'm going to guess what you need. That's a touting paprika. Paprika is one of the two substances that does not dissolve in your body. Okay. Don't be giving me propaganda. You crazy bastard. You chubby chaser. Don't give me a good moment. Subscribe about how paprika is good for you. It doesn't dissolve pepper and paprika which is why my mother ladles them on everything that she makes because she wants me to have hemorrhids as bad as her infected hemorrhids. And I did for a couple of days. They're not infected. Huh? What's that about? What's one of them? But you know if you have infected. Ask them. I'll give you her number. She will she will give you an hours free seminar on bowel movements. Hamorrhids. Anything anal. And you think you're the analyst for your sake. So you're a piker man. I can hear her. She knows her ass man is blood and pus involved. Absolutely. Infacted hemorrhids. Oosing. I mean, painful. Infacted. You're the guy these socks. No way, but that's the wrong. That's the wrong. But when I meant to say was. No, you remember when we first came here. Roy Foster had infected bleeding hemorrhids. And he got very upset because I mentioned it on the ear. But that's a long time ago. So we bet a lot of money that doesn't have infected bleeding hemorrhids anymore. Remember that? Yeah. Oosing bloody hell. I mean, we didn't need to hear about that, Roy. Oh, I guess he, I guess Oosing was like his thing because you stay hang out with this grand old woman. Roy. I don't know why. I'm not touching that because the food may be maybe here any minute. I'm not a moron. I'm a moron. I'm a moron. I'm a moron. I'm a moron. I'm a moron. I'm a moron. But I'm a moron. The commercial you're about to hear is then adolescently subjected to a moron. I've been working on medicine changes with no endorsement or authorization by the original advertiser. We apologize, however, stand by our mission to make everything that has good and decent look as ridiculous as possible. How do you feel when you don't work out? I can't go to the party tonight. My hair hurts. And I feel sad. How do you feel when you do? Do me now. Do me now. Do me. I'll break your neck. I will. I'm a moron. I'm a 24 hour business. You're certified personal trainer.

I sounded fine like me and now the ozone is starting like But here Here's a great bar with it somebody faxes me on the west bar and what am I check him out? I don't like that being like what kind of crap is that and the worst part of it is that the guy Like I said cut in the hair. He's very grateful. He's a nice guy, you know, he appreciated the tip But the other guy is either jealous or he's just an asshole and and they don't know who I am so I'm just an asshole. I think you could say he's an asshole and be fairly a close to the truth Here's Boughton Beach, hello Hey Neil. Yes sir George said that you didn't believe that somebody's Facts you that thing about the booth? Yeah, that was me on the top by corner on the news Food you should never eat it has firm in my name and what in each but did you fact it to what number did you fact?

Oh, Clarence brought me another track. Thank you. My favorite is a Florida business that's no longer around. I don't understand this plantation hospital. This is a chronic regular factory who must spend a lot of time watching a general hospital and guiding light and the passions. Where they seem to have the town seems to spend a good part of their time in hospital. Just hang it around. Plantation hospital, not plantation general, which is still there. Plantation hospital was on sunrise, but about across from plantation north high school. Right behind the JB, what is it? Before the JCC. I love that place, what a blast. All I must have been somebody's picky stuff going on there. Plantation hospital, you know? Must have been a lot of people that I'm hospital beds. Er, she catch my drift. What was that movie?

Remember what Johnny Cash said? I draw the line. I walked it. Well, look what happened to him. It's still happening. Yeah. They're all of his face all the lines. But he's looking not too good, Johnny. He's got a burning desire. And it's written all over his craggy push. 524. Why do I just see how much food I've moth yanked out of here? Those burgers were extremely good this time. Yeah. They always get better each time. Wayne Arnold and his good close like Tato to the long range. Hudson. Who probably drives a stutabaker. Don't you love this the way he always brings me in the latest literature. Wayne Arnold or Davey Town Council. You got one too. Yeah. The skills, the integrity, and this is, and I'm not sure. Oh, see, it's got a slimmer picture and a much fatter picture. Seriously, he amazes me. You remember last time he was in here, I was scared for me. He weighed 600 pounds and he was like, He was like a human walking wrinkle. Today he looked pretty good. Maybe he binges and purges, but like for months of the time. Or maybe there's more than one arm like like, like, Sodom. Huh? He's a twin. A clone. He's got a new one. Yeah, maybe he's been cloned by the clone aid railions. 19 to 1 at 5.60 WQA.

Just days after Coca-Cola announces their new flavor vanilla coke, here comes a new date from Pencey. The joy of French toast, new French toast Pepsi. Smooth, a-e-creamy, carbonated bread. The joy of French toast, new French toast Pepsi. Available now. You're used to like some things. Pepsi a lot until they dump it. You know it. Till they dump her ass. She's a little bit too racy for the image they want to portray. Maybe they'll go back to somebody more normal like Michael Jackson. It's 14 till 1 is 5. Yeah, they got some nerve. They dump her. They had Michael Jackson on their wedding. He was burning his hair up. But she's just a little bit too bizarre. And maybe a little bit too sexual. You know, it's stuff like that. Man, I wonder coke berries them. I mean Pepsi tastes so much better. Not even a coke taste like medicine, which is what it was. Yeah, right, that's right. It was originally sold by an carnival. The carnie guys. It was sold like a hangover ready. Yeah, it's a all-around remedy with cocaine. And a mixer. Cocaine. Or a good mixer. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&T line. I'm telling you, after today, no more of these, except maybe a couple more days. How long have I been saying that? It's like it's just open up Pandora's box, man. Look what popped out. Here's where am I? Fort Lauderdale. Hello? Yes, sir. Must be the ozone. Yeah, just one or the talk about this one restaurant called Bubba's restaurant in Jazz Club. I think we hand that. Oh, you did? Yeah. Right down the street from Peaches on Sunrise. Yeah. Can you believe that Peaches is that that Peaches is gone? I used to love going there. I mean, that was there. I had to be there for like 600 years, don't you think? Yeah. It's probably been turning it into an auto toy store. Again, just what we need our few more auto toy stores. Yeah, so we might notice the FBI is going there. It's great to come down here because they're all the greats went there. You've got it. Okay, I have a great day, pal. All right, thanks. He's right. You see that story about the auto toy store on a couple of days ago, but they were like investigating and palpitating and no. Almost bought a Lamborghini there, many years ago. I remember back in those, and now you don't. For our days, what about him? I'm just saying, didn't vinyl Ferrari there was like next door, whatever's next door to the auto toy store. You just got rid of your Ferrari. Good. I wonder if you'll so much better, and I'm so much happier. Look at my core vets for like a third of the price of those kinds of other cars. I just know what you can actually take it out and drive it. As opposed to those other cars, which are toys for rich boys, which leads me up. Leave it in the garage, clean it with a diaper. Toys for plastic, assholes, and believe you may, there's nothing worse. Like the tidy bull man says, then a plastic asshole. If you get cold, it can't serve. Is that what they put in? Right. Here's for Lauderdale, hello. Yeah, Neil. I'll think about that while I'm enjoying my white hot. Yes sir. Two days left, girl. I think it's on the list of the... Really? Okay. Yeah. Same for answers. I'll be damned. And my Gordon seafood rat. No, that was on there. One out of two ain't bad though, 500 even Pete Rose didn't buy 500. Right. Great job the whole thing. Yeah, Pete Rose now's going to admit that he a better baseball. What'd we do? Yeah. So now can I get in? See, I used to be in favor of getting in because he is supposed to be in those things based on how you played, not on what you were scumbag or not. You know? But now that they're trying to say, oh, well, he'll be a great spokesman for the game. Yeah, right. Ask some of the tellers that the tracks around Talbot, a great spokesman for the game he'll be, okay? Plunging his brains out, Pete. Huh? At least at last report, with those big stacks of hundred dollar bills on the table, and it vanished very rapidly from what I'm hearing. Come on, Pete. Tell us it ain't true. Tell us you're not gambling no more like a wild man. Aren't you concerned about that? Whether Pete Rose gets in? George is sorry. How do you about it? Here's a call from Tampa. Hello. Where we discovered that Donna tells us still open. That's a good news. Yep. There's door out. Excellent. Hey, what a white hot. They're like brought worst. Oh. They're indigenous to upstate New York Rochester and the, the invariants. They're never had any money out of go up to Rochester. And the summertime though, it's warm up there for about four or five days. You mentioned a WIOD tribute website with Big Wilson and Bill Couther on there. Right. Uh, can, do you know how I can find that, that website? Uh, I think you'll just have to do a search for Bill Couther Big Wilson. Because I don't, it was geocity something, but I don't, I, I never got it. Yeah, I tried to do a search on Google with, uh, with, you know, both of those names. How about Mike, you know, you do a micro-neary search, R-E-I-N-E-R-I. Okay. Because it, it's definitely got to be there. Alright, thanks. You bet. Yeah, we miss, uh, look at that. Isn't that pathetic Big Wilson? Uh, what's the name? Bill Couther. Just a, just relax. Ryan Couther. Ryan Couther and Bill Couther. One of my best friends of all time. Great guy. And the micro-neary. Really good guy. All gone. Brighten or processed to the, what are in channel for though? Her, easy on guy, you know. We just, we don't wish, Brian any, you'll, a health. We just want him to go away. Don't go away, Mad Brian. We'd much rather see Bob Soker. Because he's a good friend of ours. And he's not as melodramatic. He doesn't put on stupid leather gloves. Just because he's going to get down to like 35 or 37 degrees. I mean, that's, you understand how I feel. Having just come back from a December, in Toronto, at least half of the month. And half of the December and Amsterdam, where it's even more bitter. I mean, really bitter. And then coming in, and then these people are like, I'm like, I'm such a pussy. He's meant, oh, it's going to be so cool. Oh, gee. And you idiots run into the, the store to buy up a bunch of supplies. What do you have to get supplies for when you have a couple of cold nice. My idea is turning a heat on. Yeah, but I do. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, that's true. You could get snow on a canned goods. Yeah. What a couple of bears should be rooting for. You're going to do about that. Man. The media in this country has got everybody in it. Well, we don't need ozone. We got to media to drive everybody nuts. Well, these are really good today. No, you're right. Chewy. Every time they come here, the food gets a little bit better. When it gets a little bit fatter, Hudson gets a little more yucks. He just lasts it up. You love the neighborhood, by the way. Or how's that go? You won't love the neighborhood, but you love the food. Right. Well, they're in the daytime. 125th and Northwest 7th time. They do have a drive through. What? I think that's a drive by. Ah, they have a drive through. But my suggestion is keep the windows closed real tight in night. Why? And local. We're sports video 560C. We're 2AM. Farnished with the sewer of this place. Jump in the taxi car. But that driver should go home. You look dead mean. So quish going. If I could tell if he was in the dog. So I acted out my pocket. My pocket is red. And with my arms, the trees are made. There's no bug. Speak English. Penema. I went down to my, yeah, I met Beachwear, the weather is nice. I'm shunning. I walked into a little gut stall. But the guy there talks real fun. I asked him for a pint of cold gym beaming. He says, no, I'm the end of what does that mean? The butt is too English. I got him more. That corner deli. Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan. He's English smelly. All you can go back to the hour. I'm right. I came here. I've already heard the go. Learn my ABC. I don't say much as gross. Yes. I said pretty good. So get yourself to a classroom quick. You're an American now. Stop making me sick. You know, but it's dangerous. Come on in. Oh, great. Like, pumpkin the end is by 60. WQA, I'm almost at the end of another week. What is week here went by a fact? You know, in a spot of all the assight coaches and angst in history. So anyway, our best advice is that watch your back. I think maybe they, you know, because the guest had been kind of weak. Anyway, here's a fact. It just came in and say. Now let's fight people. Gotta stick to give his act. You're okay at our book. Okay, but those guests. Long time, listen, first time. Facts are this one says I just finished reading a book. I think you'll enjoy. It's called Waitin' Hear This George. Since there we're dealing this with all kinds of stuff. We've never talked about her. It's called Fast Food Nation. The Dark Side of all of them. The All American Meat by Erich Schloss. Well, how is he going to know that? I not only talked about it any. But I think that's the fact that book is something my apartment in Toronto way. So I'll read Peter when I go back up there. It attacks the fast food and this evening mainly McDonald's. I'll personally never put a hamburger in my mouth again. The book is, follow, amazing statistics and facts and shows just why we're such an obese nation. Enjoy your, Peter. Enjoy your show, Peter. Says. Thanks, Peter. It is a great book. We talked about it at a link. But the problem is because we're creatures of habit and we like to wait things taste. You know, you read all of that stuff. Yeah, I'm never going to touch that again. But I'll just take, I'm never going to never burger and we'll do it. You know, you just don't think about it. No. Think about what? I mean, like if you're going to sit down and have a great stick, you don't think about the slaughter houses. And all those things we're talking about here today, you see the filth and the blood on the floor and the schmutz. You just don't think about that. Right. You think, oh, it's nice and it's more of the perfection and it's nice and juicy and lousy and goosey. It came from the steak tree. Mmm. That's one of my favorites. The steak tree. Anyway, what's your favorite self load of business? Well, it's been a long time. We asked our final. It's up there all week and the rogers.com. 546 votes on a few of our real Eastern Airlines is moving into first place. I like that. Bobby Mendoor will forget about him. Six flags at Lannis. Water Park Sunrise Musical Theater. Topless Car Wash, Wolfies Playboy Club. Hollywood's for the Trem. And we're going to the roister house. And you know what we left off of there? What about the first team? Bye. Bye. Bye. It's nothing like a Tasha host holding a big black build that way. You're going to do an update.
