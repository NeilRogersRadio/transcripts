What a great poll George took yesterday Oh, I did you mention that I gave that to Petibi for a while and over again Carlis said you never mentioned it even once. He says a lot of things never mentioned it once And that's okay. Look at all of response George had on his nifty pony yesterday Oh, because I did come in here thinking I was going to work. I have to be crazy I have to be nuts because You're talking dirty right now. It's been all day. I was going to say a six hours. Over at the Cleveland Clinic. Thanks to a big bush fan. I should mention that's Dr. Bush after George W. Thanks, Doc. And they put me upside down and backward and inside out in the mind of my side and the stress test And the you ever see you ever do that on the office. I've seen the procedure like on the news where you Not only see your heart beating, but you actually heard you know the attorney audio And then it was this like that once. Oh my god. I thought I was having a fart attack. But after all of that after six hours of that I said you're talking dirty. But it's in good shape when you're okay and get out of here. And you're like that. Very good. I'm not in good shape because it was something else which I told you. But you know a minor thing. Yeah. A minor thing which we won't discuss because I don't want to go to my mother's for lunch today Have we say you're wearing pants there two sizes two small. I spent six hours laying on this thing with a gown on okay and not the usual of logic on that I've been expected to wear. But just one of those medical guns. But the ass I get home three o'clock and sure enough she had called be sure and call as soon as I get home. And I hadn't said five words before comes out. You're sick because you're wearing pants that are two sizes too small. See they didn't start out as hit and I said see it in our mom click click. Bitch. Nasty means spirited evil door. I'll tell you one thing. She ought to be on the list of the evil doors. You know what? Okay. She's got some company for she's on the list of your mom. Yeah. Just yeah because my pants are too tight. I don't wear the hip hoggresma. There was just coincidentally maybe she's psychic. Maybe she knew that piece was going to be on the news last night about the hip hoggresma. You know your nerve damage and all the other crap. Damn it. I like those headpacks. What they said. Anyway, so I'm okay. I'm back here again. George did a great job yesterday. I'm sure going to get a lot of calls about what a stupidist pull George took. And that's why I played Clint Eastwood because he's number one. Which, you know, leaves me. I mean, not that I don't like dirty hair. He's okay. And it's time. The question was who is your all time favorite movie character? Well, I forgot to tell you by the way. That today would be a real good day. It's like the middle of the week. We got the noon to one comedy hour. But today during that hour be a good time while you're listening in your car to go out and get some duct tape. And we want. Battery's. This queen. That's what you tape with the duct tape over your windows. Viz queen the queen. This queen that queen. This queen ain't going to be doing all that. I'll tell you that right now. Okay. I have no idea what you're talking about. And I showed the thing last night. I don't want to say we have a lot of illiterate people out there. But the company that makes one of the more I guess it's a brand name. It's called duct tape not duct right duct tape. You ever seen that? Yeah duct tape. If you get annoyed by the aflash spots, it's a good thing to have handy. You just put it around his beak and then he'll wet it. Was your all time favorite movie character dirty. Here are 84. Don Corly on his 75. How are you pressing? I mean, is there any. But then again, you got to keep the age thing in mind. Right. And he was middle of the pack for a while. There at least just done Corly on number 10 or something like that. What a disgrace. What a freaking disgrace. I told you that we get a lot of people out there. That's why this town is so out of it. They don't know from the godfather. And anybody who don't know from the godfather don't know squat. Tony Montana from Scarface. Oh, it's going to take me a long time to go around his pool. He's got 70. James Bond 69. Darth Vader 69. And notice James Bond is like, Generic because we just as character not actor actress right. Darth Vader 60 Carl Spakler, the groundskeeper played by Bill Murray and Canyshack 58. Now the reason you see where you thought it was bogus. It's not from the beginning. It was like number three for a while. Because this audience, Oh God. You can't get a QAM. No, they like Canyshack. That's their favorite movie. Don't you understand? Okay. Nothing. You drew me a picture. Yeah. It all makes sense. I'm just telling you. They like Canyshack. That's their thing. I like it too. That's the QAM teenager when I was a child. Anybody that would call in the Ask About, you know, the 10 year old quarterback that's playing in Oklahoma. What kind of movie do you expect they would like? The natural. Is that in here? Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger had 53. Lieutenant Kilgore played by Robert Duval on a Paco. It's not 50, which I have no idea what that was all because I never watched it. I still ain't got it. I still got it. Just fast forward to that one scene. Okay. Indiana Jones 49. Travis Bickel played by Robert DeNero Taxi. Robert 47. A very scary guy. Even scarier than Luca Brazzi. In Spectre Kusso, Peter Sellers 39. Kaiser, I don't know who this is. It's from the usual suspects. Kevin Spacey and the usual suspects. Kaiser Sochey Vermilse. Socia. Socia. Socia. Are you sure you're still in that right? Socia is Carlos. No. Socey in a tie and that would be Sochey. Socia. There is a Kaiser. It's like some kind of real humor. 306. Hannibal Lecture sounds the Lamb's 34. And how could Hannibal Lecture be beaten up by Kaiser Sochey? We did the movie Psychos. He won. And I'm sure you got this name wrong. Yeah. Not that I want to pick because it was a great pull. He got over 1,000 votes. Was my pull. Anyway, Alex Delard's Clockwork Orange. Malcolm McDonnell 32. That was not his name. Alexander Delard's Trust Me. It was Alexander Delard's. I did have a big snake, but it was in his doors. Basil. Can't the big snake in his door? Remember that one scene he pulled right out. And, in fact, there was another scene he did. Jay. See, I can't can't can't. I know. Jay from Jay and Silent Bob had 24 votes. Jeff Spikoli, Sean Penn, and Fast Times at Ridgemont, Han 25, which I did see that, but I don't remember him. That's how obscure he did. He makes me nauseous. Let's go. Rick Blaine, Humphrey Bogart and Casablanca 21. Captain Quint, jaws 21. How come that Humphrey Bogart character? Didn't Captain Quig make it on here? No. I talked about it, but you have to be shmooning. I put enough of those on my own. Captain Quig with his strawberries didn't make our play better than the Rick. But they were different. Good thing I wasn't there to do this for yesterday. I'll finish sure the results, but let me give you today's pool. So Eric can get it up. And I already printed this out there as much as I want. Much as I can take. Have a look at that. We're busy doing duct tape. And final water. Get ready. Can't start. I don't want to be negative. I don't want to like pee on the government's parade. But let me just say this to you. Because the media naturally, they don't stop and think logically. For example, if you live in Oni, onto New York, if you live in Ishpaming, Michigan, if you live in the Buc, Iowa, I'd say that they need for duct tape and tachystic for your windows. And what was it this, this Queen? This Queen, yeah. The need probably is low, but if you live like an a major metropolitan area like New York, Philadelphia, Boston, LA, Miami. What else? Detroit? Yeah. I got a mess with that. Chicago? Chicago? Chicago? Chicago? Chicago? Chicago? That may be out of go out and buy heavy duty. I just find it mind-boggling. And what's even worse is that people are doing it. Oh, I do. Of course here in South Florida, all you got to do is say, Hurricane. And right away, they all run like storm, rainstorm, and others are quite odd. Stabilists, people are out shopping. What it is, that's why they're stimulating the economy. Although Alan Greenspan says, well, we'll get to that. Not a good time for a tax cut. Alan. I wouldn't start my car alone if I were you these days. Okay, and I'm saying I get that remote control job. Don't be making comments like that about not a good time for a tax cut. 10 past nine at 5.60. Oh, here's the pool before I do the break. What's your take on the latest bin Laden tape? It's not him. He's really dead. All the more reason to attack Iraq now proves that Bush is playing into his hands. It changes nothing or what me worry is our pool today. Pretty good pool if I say so myself. Five magnificent choices. I want you to get a panicky, but. A lot of bad crap going on and what they worried about on ABC and at Good Morning America show. Michael Jackson's nose. And I don't want you to nervous about it because Carlos is assured all of us that Michael Jackson is not a pedophile. So we feel luck that or about that. Thank the Lord for those little kids who are sharing Michael's bed. He just is lonely and likes company. You're an idiot, Carlos. You're just you're pathetic. That's what happens when you smoke all in fact. It's that's why he's going to go for a physical today. Young man, his 80's going to go to go to draw blood. You're going to do all kinds of crap. Probably stick their finger when his back them. Well, yeah, they do that too. Look what happened to John Kerry, man. You can never be too old. Huh? Right. To have somebody stick their finger in there and check your prostate. Right. Is that if I Joe was just here, he had some issues with that. But he knew about that. He had some issues with it. With his prostate. He did. Yeah. Like what? Tell him to study wasn't milking it off in enough. True story. You shouldn't see the prescription. Well, that's after nine at five 60 WQAM. Maybe that's why he's going to be a treasure island tonight. Really? No, maybe he'll show up. Virginia, of course.

And it's a good thing I do bring him. I want to know why because our our equipment here are internet connection. Everything here is screwed up. You know. It's really a piece of crap. It's a crap shoot. Yeah. But Joe Costello is not the one that screwing things up. He came in and told us that this morning. While he and Carlos were giving us a lecture about how Michael Jackson is not a pedophile. And we feel very, very sorry for him. I feel sorry for us. That ABC news is I mean the price of gas is what about 75 bucks a gallon now. Not that they're exploiting this situation you understand. And we got the latest audio tape from Osama Yomama allegedly. And we got the terror attack that may take place as early as some time and the end of this week. It'd be us in this week. And what am I missing? On Chicago, that all is a crowd and Academy of Ordinary. Right. And we're worrying about Michael Jackson. Oh, that was for no nations came right. And that's why I just said. I want to just say I thought. I thought you were talking about the band. You're going to start with that again with Peter Satera. He is a wife you know. Okay, let's see how many of the new pull is up there already before I get back to yesterday's video. We're going to wait ahead of ourselves, which is good because we got that pain in the S new to one hour. Which really breaks our heart. Then I got to go to lunch at mommy's today. Maybe she can let out my pants. I'm not making that story up here. This is the same woman when I had a stroke years ago, 12 years ago. Was that my house taking care of my dogs? I had a force my way out of the hospital drove myself home. And the first thing that she says to me, I've got that pain in the S new to one hour. Which really breaks our heart. Then I got to go to lunch at mommy's today. Maybe she can let out my pain. I like how she never was 20 years. And he's a great actor. I just just liked the fact that he kept plugging it. Trish Van Derger because he was married to then. She was like 50. He was like 100. He was plugging her lot. Fletch Chevy Chase 15. Jewels windfield Samuel Al Jackson and Paul fiction, which again, the audience has an obsession with Paul fiction because they've been told it's a really good movie. Even though it's just 15. Khan Ricardo Matlabon and Star Trek 2013. John Torrance, Jack Nicholson and the Shining 13. Here's Johnny. Igor and young Frankenstein. That could be Marty Feldman could. Yes, 12. Tommy, Joe Pesci in good fellow as 12. See again, I mean he was good. Yeah, but I thought Robert and Error was even better in good fellows. Right? Yeah, over there. Right down there. Right down there. But they liked him because of that. He didn't want you to use. He didn't want to dress. That's what I'm saying. They liked the wise guy. That's the male audience. They liked the wise guy stuff. They don't like. There was a lot of wise guys in the gun, father. They didn't get it. If somebody was said, hey, these are a bunch of wise guys. They would like to better I guess. Fenster, but played by Veniseo and Del Toro and usual suspects in the sea of 12. It was all right. Dr. Evil Austin powers only 11. How's that possible? I don't know. Yeah, flesh was way up on the list. Go down there. Billy Jack 10. Do you know what that sound like? I just make a sound like Mrs. Wallace on passions. Oh, they did. And by the way, Beth, you're not getting me, Luis. That scene just goes. That kind of call the other day. He's right. Goes on and on and on. And Beth is standing in a corner. Eve is dropping in. Luis and Sheridan. I can't live without you. But you have to know how well. And there's Beth. Oh, goody. Oh, crap. Jack 10. Mad Max 9. How about Billy Gene speaking of Michael Jackson?

What happened to you? Yes, there was only out of here one day. What happened? It's something a lot of drugs after the shy see. But I told him who's going to do the show. I'm going to do the show. I started popping all kinds of pills. Where'd ones and yellow ones and blue ones? Green ones. Round ones. A Mad Max 9. Neo from Matrix 9. Bull Meacham. Robert Doel in the great. Centini 8. Now that's a good choice. I'm amazed at this audience. The same audience at likes. Candy Shack so much. Pig Bull Meacham. Raven Robert. The four calls. The character had eight votes. That was a good movie. Of course it had a cult following, which means it was a bomb at the box office. But it was a damn good movie. What is it that you're doing with? What are you, uh, posking around? Log stuff. Oh. Don't be mess with a log, Mr. Howard Beale from never not. Now that of course was my vote. Howard Beale. Now how come the internet keeps going down here, Carlos? Don't tell me that we're having more problems with our damn connection again. It is. It's just on. Huh? It's completely gone. My clock there. It is 73 votes. I'll keep my eye on it. I'm a bad ass. But I don't think that's anymore. How are we going to have only eight votes? Now I'm going to tell you seriously. Okay. Maybe I'm the only one who likes that movie. And seven other people. But if Peter Finch, if that wasn't one of the greatest performances in a history of mankind, I don't explain to me why. How could you not love that performance? And a little character. A lot of pity was a high-end season. Bullshment. Right. Oh and speaking of bullshit. What's that one movie? That was now made for the Oscar something Schmidt. What is the name of that movie? About Schmidt. About Schmidt. Never saw a preview of it. About Schmidt. Is that what this show was about? Right. I guess it's a movie about this show. It's all about Schmidt. Man. Howard Beale. Simon, man! Alan, man! I don't know what it takes as anyone. Oh, only eight votes. Moses played by Charlton Hester. And the 10th command. I wanted it. I thought it was Moses our friend Moses and it's Charlton Hester. He would've gotten all the votes. He had some, but a lot of his fans forgot to vote for him. He was Son of a- And I know that was very insensitive. Sorry, Ronnie. Buffalo Bill sounds lands head only seven. Raymond, Dustin Hoppen, and Rayman had six. Dr. Frankenferter from the Rocky Horror Picture Show Six. Rocky Balboa. Six. Well, Stan's deal. Gary Olvin in the professional six. Vincent Vega played by John Revolta in Pulp Fishing Head 4. Also with four Frank Booth Dennis Hoppen, Blue Velvet. And John Reiter. Who played? Who was played by record Howard and a hit your head only one vote? I mean, well, at least he got the one. I know. Well, somebody must have called it in, right? Right? The guy who invented finger foods and he only got one vote in his poll. Excellent poll, a mediocre result. That's all I can tell you. A little bit disheartened by your result. 27 after nine and five sixty WQAM. If you're not feeling that great this morning, because you didn't get a good night's sleep last night.

And luckily we're getting, you know, every once in a while actually comes back on here. What's your take on the latest been Laudon tape that was released yesterday? What's your take? Proved that bus is playing it was hands dirty. It changes nothing 26. All the more reason we attack Iraq now. Now, 23. Oh, what me worry 16 and it's not him he's really dead. 7. How do we know it is him? I mean, I realize that they have these experts, these voice recognition experts who analyze the tape. Well, like those tapes that we intercepted with the Iraqis talk into each other. Right. We know that those were real people. Oh, I'm just a loop. There's no question about that. Well, what we got on the website today, some pretty good stuff. US had hit data hinting of Oklahoma bombing, which is very disturbing. And by the way, that was under the watch of Bubba. So all new people, all you boost offenders, we're not the good of Lemmo on that one. This was under the watch of the FBI, of course. They just don't seem to get, you know, they can't get it together. Chicago tops Oscar nominees along with all that Schmidt. What is that about Schmidt? Well, this one too, this is somehow we missed this. Sarah Settable in charge of making terrorist threaded airport in Tampa. A 30 year old woman's been charged with telling a screen or a Tampa international airport that she was a terrorist and had a bomb and knife and her luggage. The FBI said Monday. Well, at least the FBI got that on the control. Silla Szochi, SCOK30 of Sarah Sota, which charged with providing false information regarding the presence of a bomb in a piece of baggage according to the FBI. She was released Monday and $10,000 bond, and it says here on the AP, there is no telephone listing for Sochi and Sarah Sota. She don't have no phone. Sochi was a ticket at passenger Saturday, but she told a screener she was a terrorist and had a bomb and knife in her baggage according to the FBI. A day earlier, the Bush administration raised the National Terror alert for me over war and which we already know that. Orange alert, just in case you've been sleeping, case you've been hibernating out of touch. There's another facts and there's still coming out with the movies by the way. Which is OK, little kills from good time. How about the man with no name while he did have a name, manco, the Clint Eastwood character in the Goodbandy ugly, also a fistful dollars a few dollars more. Uh, manco. Is that manco? I thought he wasn't Chicago. Manco, do it a morning show. Yeah. I don't have any idea what that's all about. Well, there are Clint Eastwood, I've said, I like Clint Eastwood, my favorite Clint Eastwood movie was play a Misty for me. Yeah. That was good. I like that better than dirty hairy, but they like Rituate as violence. They like movies that have a lot of shootings, like Hulk fiction, a lot of dead people, a lot of bodies. A lot of Rituate as violence. Yeah, I like Rituate, Harry, but I'm not in the same league with play Misty for me, would just have a water or outlaw Josie whales, which had shooting and a good story. Play Misty for me. Now is, how many times I've seen that? Hundred, at least. Nobody ever talks about that movie. That's a little close to home for those of us who are ready at a. And why, what about her name? What that was the name of the character just the broader play? Uh, somebody will know. Misty. No. Poor Earl Garner, he's still dead. He's rolling over in his grave thinking about that. It's like Misty for me. And of course he had that real. That that. The so many things if you're in radio about that movie that you love, for example. He didn't he didn't queue up for the record, he just he put a needle on the record and we'll see. Yeah, put the needle on the record on the turn table back in the days when we had records. They remember that well, a soul for its do? They just he just reached over put the needle on the record and bought a thing. There was like right off you know like magic like magic trick by Clint Eastwood. It was just so many funny thing it was almost as fake but at least it was a good movie unlike talk radio Eric Bogosian that piece of crap Or the for the board up is spinning around like he's like a droodle and heat like Linda Blair's head on a totem pool just spinning around Throwing carts and uh, Mr. Cool man, Mr. Cool. Well, we at least we didn't confuse it with you Here's the fact that says Doesn't it seem that we Americans are getting ready for our next fight when the last one isn't finished It racked it and blow up the world trade center was all kind of huh When are if we get attacked this week or next it'll be seen now Just because they're saying it's gonna be this week. Do you believe that? No, I'm fact I think every time that they say it's gonna be at a certain time That makes it less likely that it's gonna be at that time But it says when are if we get attacked this week? It'll be all kind of I consider is that in our need for revenge after an attack people become bloodthirsty For getting the real enemy and jumping behind the bushmysters war for oil for getting about been laden and a real threat to American safety here at home Also my the only one that wonders why it is that converts predict in attack book and stop on Yeah But anyway Well, that's a bit, but I just have it to be in there.

I saw it on the headlight Would you be with Army surplus gas mask in a whole thing? It happened 60 years ago during World War II And it's still unsolved An aesthetic prowler on loose an aesthetic prowler adds victim Shocking headlines in the local newspaper reflect the horror of the chilling attack In Matoon Illinois At top Mrs. Bert Kirney tends to eryreal daughter Dorothy Olene victim of the attack Now if you were gonna like La Glauche Terrorist attack on the USA wouldn't you think Matoon Illinois would be a great place to do it First place I think of A small Illinois town is gripped by panic for weeks Is terrified residents become convinced to run to attack by a deranged bioterrorist And suffered temporary paralysis in other painful symptoms It sounds like a horrifying event Rift from today's headlines but it happened almost 60 years ago during WWII And an inquire investigation discovered that his frightening little moments in it Has ery parallels to the anthrax bioterrorism The Chukamurica and its chilling connection The person of interest in those recent attacks Are you ready for that? No Just before Labor Day 1944 residents of the Quay town of Matoon population 15,000,000,000 Began reporting battling gas attacks As they slept in their beds the first bioterrorist attacks on American soil The victim has been women in chillin complaint of being filled by a sweet smell A gas sprayed into their bedrooms They suffered extreme physical symptoms ranging from intense nausea And blinding disiness to burnt mouts and lips and partially paralyzed legs The Matoon bioterrorist in it was never solved And the recent anthrax attacks of completely baffle donations stop investigators The FBI focused their anthrax probe on scientists Steven J. Hadfield The work that the biographer defense lab at Fort D.T. Maryland the inquire learned that Oh, you're going to, are you strapped in? Yeah The inquire has learned that Hadfield went to high school in Matoon, Illinois And could very well have known about this mysterious incident The perpetrator known as the Mad Gasser of Matoon raised many questions in the minds of the shaken citizens Was the Gasser an enemy agent testing in a weapon? Was the terrorist a twisted scientist to escape mental patient? Or could the Gasser actually be a figment of people's imagination spread by mass panic? As some experts suggested Not sure thing it must be just a coincidence that he was the court He was born or he went to high school in Matoon, Illinois this person of interest And then they're digging him up again, you know, last couple of years Yeah, there was a wrecking that old lame thing 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T line, pound, and B, chill out No, how you doing? Okay Good, I just filled up my, I guess, the terrorist support vehicle over here at X on About 500 bucks Well, it was 550 this week But you know, I don't understand how everyone can think that Bush is not behind this gas pricing increase I mean, if you got X on on a fourth quarter profit post you know over four billion dollars I mean, how many hundred dollars? How can they expect us to do anything else but go to war? Thank the Lord that they're not exploiting all these horrendous things that are going on And they're possible, I mean, you know, gases or oils up to 35 bucks a barrel which is very high But they're saying that these pricing increases aren't in any way justified But it ain't stopping me, you know what I'm saying?

Yeah, I mean two things for you on your pole It's not a saw me is really dead. It's a plot by bush just to get America to back up Yeah, all right, so it was one other was bush made the tape as I would you say well I'm not saying he made the tape The administration did Yeah, well, that's one thing that's one way of thinking yeah, I don't know He's looking for backing right yeah, and what's the other thing? The other thing with the visk queen you need plenty of visk queen and duct tape duct tape the corners God get some olive oil Frisco okay, great and have a good time have a party. I guess he's gonna be a treasure. I'll let us see it tonight Ha ha ha ha Oh, that was duct tape we said sir with a D. I think he misunderstood it duct tape You know what this reminds me I don't want to be a skeptic or a cynical or you know not not abide by the word of my government, but It's all it's a step away From back during the Cold War When it's a little kitten school is to have these instructional films to show us what to do in the event of a nuclear attack And they would show those and it would show you how to hide under your desk in school, you know, I'm saying It's a bomb hide under the desk put your hands over your head Stick one foot up your back home ass because that'll keep you from melting right It's it's one step away from that and of course the obedient masses out there They're gonna go out there and they're they're not gonna go out there. They're doing it They're doing it and I'll say it like I said in the beginning of the show nobody's commented on this, but it just makes common sense to me Although that's story about Matuna, Illinois. I mean, that's a little bit disconcerting Even though Stephen had to go by the high school there But I don't think if you live in Poccipsy New York or in El Miro or in Albeon, Michigan or in how in Indiana Or in Shelby, Montana. I don't think you're in a lot of danger Right for hate But you never know I mean, what are they talking about they're talking about East Coast targets Primarily the North East seems to be what they're emphasizing and you know, so we never heard one more word about that Light box truck Please never another word about it. Well, I was a rock Well, we're too busy. I was showed on Iraq, but at any rate What what good is it gonna do? What could it possibly do To put duct tape on your windows What is that? It's like here's a picture of a guy Pedro Laira and employee of Flagler surplus. Well, see, I mean, they're just they want to do business Which is fine more power to them, you know, who don't want to buy those ugly things anyway In fact, a hundred years ago when my father had an army surplus store We used to sell those to gas mask army surplus gas masks If I would only save that you know, I'd not be in the chair right now could have saved one. I got one Wouldn't go down the elevator that day When I said I was in a fog, I should break it to work. He's done in one of the gas masks in stock Tuesday a few have been sold of late. It says Anti biological suits gas masks all of these things people are out buying up And despite of the fact now when we had the anthracicare didn't they tell us that this wouldn't do any good? Yeah, then they tell us that yes, try to oh And smallpox will this will I pretend now of course not But never let it make you feel better as you're breathing your own breath well.

I'm here to address the United Nations with in Contrary to Beloved in Subcedure of the United Nations, the most famous of the American of the United Nations, the most famous of the American of the American. Now ladies and gentlemen, if you'll just watch the screen in front of you, you will see our renderings of Saddam's arsenal. Now this is more than just a car too, because we feel Barley Coyote is an elegance to Saddam. As you can see, he hides quite an arsenal of weaponry in his cave. Now this scene here proves beyond any shadow about Saddam as indeed hiding his weapon. You'll observe the coyote holding his ear and dissipation of destroying his infidelity. Only to discover his own nuclear warhead pointing out his butt. Now here in the attempt to escape invading forces, he paints a picture on a rock, nor punish him in, thinking of course he can run through the picture he paints. I hear by submit this as conclusive proof and the forwardier support. Thank you. Every one in office did the same as me. The only difference was they were a little more discreet. You elected me or president, not your slaves. No matter who you put here, you'll always be the slaves. Remossing to the Bush, they all had some kind of power. The first thing they did was to make sure that the warhead was not a good man. No matter who you put here, you'll always be the slaves. Remossing to the Bush, they all had something on the side, but the press of it was best to keep it quiet at the time. And helping back that and it's never gone to stop. Every president has done the presidential bath. When FDR was given us a present new tale, Hell and Nor was given chits a reason to spoil. As a powerhead, it back and were a war too. No misdrawered that he locked her in the school's shoes. And still I can interpret her as that smoke coming in. And don't get me started all the candidates. And happen back then, and it's never gone to stop. But the ever president has done the presidential bath. I guess you could say I've been the final lead. Compared to what went on with the candidates. The girls I had all of bad and make you a win. Unless the cause of don't have FDR offered for mopped up. It wasn't a coincidence, just bad luck. That whoever is the main love of vacuum that sucks. And it's never gone to stop. Ever president has done the presidential bath. When you're the president, you have to ask yourself, Why not? The president's bath can start making a script and all the hope it's not. The president has done the presidential bath. Welcome back to the glittering pageantry of the Mohawk and a name of the show. We have a full duck at today. Include the cavalcade of articulate athlete of yours. You don't have tight smoke, it's still at it. You're singing the songs, making fun of me.
