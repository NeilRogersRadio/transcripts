I thought he called me an asshole saying I was trying to stir it up my point back to Howard is don't listen Listen to 101.5. Let me see what age group 101.5 for Howard. Maybe 102.7 It's a measly listening love music so you could focus on your wife and your family and the grandkids Instead of listening and always calling the radio station. He's becoming Howard the caller like Howard from Boca Howard from Boca It's like you know, it's okay So anyway, he's he's listening so this one to get the message out and don't call my show to just for a record Don't call off the air because I don't want to talk to you and I don't want to hear you on the private line congratulations. You know the private line number.

You seem like a decent person and I know you've been getting that taken a big hit on the radio station from everybody else But it's over me and you done absolutely okay. Yeah, where does for all have this thing going on our website does he have his own website Hi, well, shouldn't we fight out? From hey Clarence. Oh Clarence is a busy. I'm sure he's on cure.

I am Veter world will go out there fight out by the way look what I held on to here He doesn't know about it. Well, well, I will We'll tell you when he comes back in anyway George Jose and a apology of major apology before we start to show today a big fat major apology to my good personal friends at city like magazine Can't believe what you said about them the other shameful yeah, do you want to start apologizing now until he comes back I didn't say anything about them except that I didn't read they had you didn't you said that they should only rot in hell And that there are a bunch of asshole that they're promoting a pirate radio and as much as stuff like that I thought you said that I said that Anyway, so come to fight and see that it's not really anybody's fault except to course from inside this building I mean it's so lame So freaking lame if we had anybody paying attention to business and what's going on now They're all whipped up and excited about wow for us got that big piece next week, which is great. I love that Get some good publicity for him and for the station in city link although nobody reads it But the issue last week and it's also the audience the negative audience. I'm always the one our Neil so negative I'm not negative you people are negative Usually before the issue even comes out people are calling us up with what's in it whatnot So the only thing that I got was that page would be best a if the best radio personality and then it's the Schwarzier from the pirate radio station whatever that would go with whoever he was Michael Michael motorcycle And in the meantime, here's a whole section hall of fame and I've asked for days now ever since I've been back I've been asking every day would somebody please fix this thing from the city link and see what that's really all about because They said they did something very nice for you in there and Then you'd have to apologize for George Griffin the mass On so come to fight out that I went because nobody facts didn't nobody mail that to me No nothing so Muff had a good suggestion this morning It's about time you know what I mean absolutely And he said how about going on their website City link magazine calm and sure enough I have a type didn't there and there was and Here's last week's issue Hall of Fame O3 is the section you're finding in and it's and let me just read the thing up front Because I want to like try to get back in her good grace as even though I think you probably spoil it It says when it became apparent a couple of years back that certain categories always produced the same winners in the annual This annual issue we created the city link Hall of Fame to an eight to a noble lemon a more elite best of best of Plain and open up the categories to new talents You following that He distracts a hell out of me. I'll tell you he's just a mean you by the way Carliske got laid last night beiner boy got laid How many times Get out of here yeah four times Four times Who was he? Anyway, we created the city link Hall of Fame to a noble them on a more elite best of plane and open up the categories to new towns the criteria Was simple if unscientific be it a person place we've been cocktail for was a candidate We couldn't imagine publishing the issue without Here then are the inductees from 2000 one in 2002 you'll find this years inductees at the fun of each section got it Got it the Hall of Fame for example waitress rosemary O'Neill at Criolinas in for Lauderdale. I love rosemary. Don't you? Oya she be the best bakery grand for no Fort Lauderdale and then a.m. radio personality Neil Rogers a m560 WQ Not a whole lot at all of them are short Commercial radio doesn't completely suck in south Florida's longest uncle Neil is on the earth's in That's sweet that's a really nice thing and I want to thank my friends at city link profusely even though nobody reads it Thank them a lot because they didn't shine me they didn't ignore me like you were trying to say They must stick it right in me and twist it. Huh? I apologize in addition to which what they're basically saying is that you know if if they were gonna do it honestly That there's certain categories here that would be number one air every single year forever That's not fair. They're pushing the sandwich means we're getting old is what it really means Which is true, but that's a nice touch. Thank you, city link and don't forget this coming next week's issue to have a big peace on for real A speaking of a big piece Beiner boy he's real excited because he got laid four times last night, but what doesn't understand is he's not getting paid this week again What are you looking me like that for? What do you say why is that? Because parents doesn't like you No special reason just parents don't like you. I can't do it to no that he didn't give you the stuff Oh, he didn't get I could have played that for the whole four hours You are so pathetic man. We're we're ecstatic that you got laid 40 times last night, but you're just you're tragic You're tragic you need to be led by the hand you need to be Beiner boy on a leash you need to seriously on a leash In fact, the freaky carolace will take you around on a spike leash a beautiful thing Seriously, you need to be taken around leash. I got your stub right here in the paycheck stub too And I'm looking in here and I'm thinking of myself here for all the belly aching he does and squeezes money out of you and me He's a deathdoo and that bad for a punk You make it a few bucks here Oh Higher Well, I come about 60 cents an hour and a bad. Oh, seriously, you're not doing that bad But I'm talking about for this place, okay for this place Would usually whoever sits in that chair You know, they what they get is like everybody's good wishes. That's what they get I'm painting They get wishes. Well, like if we get done they get everybody's dirty looks is what they get So just to count your blessings. Okay, plus you got lead four times last night. So here's your I'm gonna hold on a wood for a while because otherwise you'll lose it Not seriously don't give him anything that he'll he'll lose a goddamn thing Let me do oh this is great this is fantastic This is gonna be such a good day. This is probably the only call we'll get today because there's nobody here. WQAM deal yes, sir. Please retire. Oh right there. I knew it I knew I was gonna be there for the punch. They'll please retire That is still barking at the moon and it's still there. Thank you very much for being so loyal by the win listening every single minute of every day to the world flaming Neurodjeud He's not crying Oh That's okay Everyone What is it? 2015 already. God damn, I told you this ten to two things was fast. Here could be the silliest facts I've ever gotten in my life and I've covered a lot of territory. From Craig and downtown Miami. You got quite a sense of humor Craig. Hey Neil, please don't go back to Toronto. When you're down here in Miami you're funnier than when you are in Toronto. When you're in Toronto you're all happy and shmit and it's not the same. Here in Miami you're pissed off and rip into people's asses and you can see what Georgian Carlos are doing and stuff. So please stay here in Miami. Please with a bunch of exclamation parts. Hey Marks Craig? No, no. No chance. Please stay here in Be as miserable as the real. We need it. I'll just like that first call right out of the box. You know, this is like I said yesterday is a new one. Replay's retire. Neil, retire. This is the new guy. Just one after another, the passing parade of misfits of misquiet of assholes. Who do you believe me the day when I will retire and I wish it were like tomorrow? They won't know what to do with themselves. Oh no. I can't see. I can't. I'm down here and I can't see what they're doing anyway because Beena board got only knows what he's doing now. Off playing a grab ass with Zach in a hallway. There's another one couldn't get laid and he's married. Didn't he married? I have no idea. Zach. I don't know. I think he is. Does he have a wife? I don't know. I really don't. I don't know. I really don't. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I really don't. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I really don't. I don't know. So Craig, haven't great life. I'm glad that you enjoyed my misery but the answer is absolutely no. It's hot. It's humid. It's boring. It's suffocating. It's the swamp land. See, end of the world. Curtin Orlando says, You're right. Network yesterday on the year. The only one for the day. Have you been able to post it on the website? Please try to get on it was excellent as always. Great show. Well thank you Curtin Orlando, but it wasn't an editorial number one. Number two. It's not on the website because Beena Boy is like, Seriously. You're going to have to bitch him out. Which I'm sure you didn't do it. Oh yeah. I have the phone call for the reason. He's got us get his ass on that chair. He will not listen to me. And listen to hell down. Listen, he will not listen to me. He will not listen to anyone. Really? Listen to reason. Well, you know what? Here's this paste up. It's a stub. It's already in this. I should have just not told him a lot of it. Where did it come from? The stub? Yeah. Clarence. So Clarence is laid it down? Yeah. And in other words, we're a B-N-R-Boy couldn't find it. Yeah, I blew it. We've had a really good thing going there. Then I guarantee him Tia his ass would be in that chair. But anyway, didn't I say we were going to put that on there? And I kind of put it over here where the stuff is that I, you know, and he's oblivious. He's too busy getting laid in crap. He's got his own agenda. He's not going to act exactly right. He's got his own agenda. Like trying to hit the muffin the face with that yo-yo or whatever that was. He was sticking in the muffin face. It muffs, puss. Yo. It was disgusting. So anyway, we will put that on the website. The declaration for the future of America Challenge for George W. Bush. And it's sponsored by ARM in New York. Whatever the hell that means. What does that mean? So what I'm going to do is I'm going to, I'm going to staple it. No, no, seriously, I'm going to staple it to his face that didn't hear. Yeah, and then to his head and then to his ass. And then maybe he's doing his privates and then maybe in the midst of all his exciting exploits. Maybe he'll find it. But I doubt it. That's it. Where did he go? Do you want my theory? Yeah, what's the theory? Is that Kim and he was that old? What was that all about? I gave these people the valaki, which is supposed to only open like, It can turn on the car and it's like, oh, Jesus, Craig, you know, This guy would not time. I am going to see him out. There's a guy out of the overpass named Craig and downtown Miami. One of your friends, no doubt, who faxes me and says, Please don't leave here. Please stand Miami. You're so much more pissed off and exciting when you're down here. I don't want to be here. I can't handle your exploits, okay? Now, I don't want to hear about it. I don't want to know. Sit your ass down in a chair. Take the microwave from the sit down in the chair and shut up. You're making me psychotic. You're making me crazy. So I stapled to your pay stub envelope. Here I stapled a thing that I gave you yesterday, which is what some other facts I wanted to know that declaration for George W. Bush that we were going to put on our website, but of course, You're too busy getting laid. So I stapled it right there it is. Okay, right on top of the monitor there. Keep that in mind. I thought you were going to ever get it, but it's just it's there. Oh my god. How do you how did my it's your like I said, Dr. Frankenstein is your creation? You invented it. It's out of my control. Where the hell did you find it? Well, here's yesterday's pool result. And believe you may, I know what's going on. This today. Every single day you can see the law of diminishing return in this town. All you people in retail by the way, I would like to. So I can say, how do they do it? You know, I don't know. How do they do it? Because they always say in this town, if you're in business, if you don't do the business in most businesses, January through like April, right? If you don't like really do heavy, busy, busy, gigantic business during those months, you're screwed. So if you don't, and then comes like May and June and like right now, come up into July, you have to go through that entire period, praying and waiting, somehow you can survive until the so-called season starts again. In this seasonal horse and buggy town, because there's nobody here now. I could have gone bowling on a highway coming to work this morning. And then I get to like Iv's Dury Road. I get to the stadium thing there on the corner. I get to Iv's Dury Road in generally. Usually it's kind of that tough left turn where they try to give as many people killed as possible. Right. And you know, usually they have to kind of look around and wait a little bit. And all week long, it's been better than usual because it is, you know, holidays now kids are out of school. Everybody's gone, but today it was like the defining moment. There was nobody. There was nobody to my left. There was nobody to my right. There was nobody to my behind. There was nobody in front of me on the other side of the dead end there. There was nobody anywhere. Not even a porcarot is motorcycle. There was nobody. But even a mooney selling flowers. Not even that. I had to get all the way up here in the corner. Bives Dury and 441 till I got to my first homeless voice mob. Not even a black muslim with fires at a no time. That's their corner. Although I guess they've leased it out all the night Fridays to the homeless voice people. They've come to an arrangement. They have a lendalice deal. Yesterday's pool. I'm a woman. Let's take another one on six. Maybe it's the same guy. WQAM. Okay. They're. See what I'm saying? I'm going to get today. That's all we're going to get. So that's two for two. WQAM online nine, which is never real call. Hello. Yes, it is. Is it a real call? Yes, it is. I can't believe you. This is not from. But this is carrying it down to our family. I'm not a stick like Carlos. I mean, they grew a girl. But listen. You ever used to watch the very sandwich show? I hated that show. It was ridiculous. I can't stand him. Because the real last set is because. Because pain equals plenty. And I'm pretty sure George is to watch it with his George. Like it. George hated it. What was wrong with it? I thought it over a weekend. I thought it was. I thought over a memorial deal. When I'm a memorial day. I thought it was great. I got hooked on right away. Well, see that there goes to show you. That's another reason I'm not staying here is because of people with taste like yours. It's an awful show. Okay. Well, you know, I mean, when you're down here, if I go and say it about the facts, when you're down here, it's just great. I mean, you know, no, no, it's not great. It's great for you because you have the feet. Right. I'm suffering. And I don't want to suffer just to make you happy. Good luck. Okay. Craig, I'll see you. 10 number three. Okay. Like the show. I mean, I think I made him feel bad. Good. No, see. I don't take instructions from the audience. I retired. No. Stay here. No. It's a radio show. It's free. Obviously you're loving it. Everyone of you on there, you wouldn't be listening right now. Even Moe is listening. You think a guy like him would all the money he's making, which is like a gift at this point at this stage of his life. You think he'd be like, you know, out there on the course right now, getting ready for a big weekend. I heard him say this morning. He's going to be like playing golf tomorrow on golf on Sunday. And maybe he'll think about coming in on Monday. You know, no, don't bother. I think somebody had it. Who was that suggested that about the car pulling? Chris Ferrell was saying he wants to get a limo to bring him from Boca back and forth every day. And somebody said, hey, just have a car pulling with Moe. Right. And boy, you should have seen a look on his post. He was just going nuts. Somehow he can't envision himself and that explorer. I think I'm from Boca that long hour ride with Moe. And then, of course, Moe would have to record our way to Rondal 10 every day. They wouldn't have to drive the explorer. Now they could drive the Jaguar. You could get a hover limo. Is the matter, fact, for well-considden the back seat and pretend that Moe was his limo driver. Huh? And let Moe give much of a driver on a way out. That would be good. Anyway, here's the pull from yesterday. I know I'd get around with sooner later. Which of these statements is the most ridiculous? 1637 votes pretty heavy duty for nobody being here. George W. Bush is a great leader. 787 found that most amusing. The most ridiculous statement of the mall. Pieces coming in the middle east. 276 of you said that's ridiculous. George is a great villain for Neil. 208. Moe Howard David has a great show 185. Think his show is just absolutely pathetic. The Marlins will win 91 games 85. Clarence our program director will get laid this year. 53. Confidence is booming now for Clarence. It's starting to move up a little bit. And, or is that no see that actually that's not good is it? He'd be better off if he weren't last play. Right. And the forl is got a pleasant voice 43. So forl once again, it comes out smelling like a rose. Sounding like a razor blade but small and like a rose. Not a rose is lovely is boner boy and he's like covered from head to toe with cashmere Boke and what's that baby. Baby clone. Baby clone. See I'm going to clone this summer probably he's going to baby clone. It's right next door. So forl's got a pleasant voice in last place which is a positive forl forl he just love him there obsessed with it and I think that's great. It's about time. We're having a great time here Craig under the overpass. Chronicle Craig. So leave me alone. We got two poles today one early and then the other one forl later when the show And through the weekend. And then we got to talk about the hot couples contest. We got 50 billion votes on air. Inter like a 20 million vote. That's a movie. Last time I checked it say humongous response. Too bad it's not a close race although it's a very close it's tight for second. Right. I mean it is nip and tuck you couldn't put a curly hair in between those two couples. But anyway speaking of couples this is general and we sponsor anything that we've had on there and I probably forgot some which picture on our website you like best. Moist grew as Neil swinging mo is what we call that okay. Mozot the clown. Squorley mo. Hareless toothless mo which was the that preceded mo the mozot the clown. Muscle bound deal God that's the brand new one it's on there now. Clarence and the beast although we have a new Clarence and the beast but that won't be up there in time for this pull. But when you see that. With the wedding date and the whole deal love. I think for all should have that wedding on here on his show. Right. That would be big. Forget about that Marlon game the other night. Clarence and the beast Mo and Gildy. Doing a tango. That's a lovely thing very very tight. The titty picks on the hot couple contest. And I hate them all because we always have to put some really. Yeah. And they're just just to keep a lot of you at best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10. The best you're 10.

The best you're 10. The best you're 10. the evolved park and then of course with the Joe Rose and Moe episode and just a whole bunch of crap that came down this way. Lucky you. And B.D. Boyle finally getting laid and running around. He's got a big sign here. You got laid and paid. Late and paid. Oh, maybe. Oh, here's this thing sitting up here by the way, you're a thing is coming here now and take this. So come, get in really nervous because it's only 10 30. But knowing you, you'll never remember by two o'clock to get that. Stick it to your stick in your pants by 11 35 god. So anyway, watch the reading. Excellent movie last night and you had seen it where you forgot about it. Right. Neither one of you ever gave me it for the list. Put it on my list by the way when you get around to it. Yeah. It's all written in the big bucks now. Sleepers. I just give it to Muff to a watch over the weekend along with the directors cut of Reckling for a dream. Which, unfortunately for him he went to. I'll say it again. I don't know why any. You see you're wrong. But what? Oh, and I also want to say thanks to my good friends at Circuit City. I went and bought some crap there last night. That's a great place. It's all right. I mean, granted it's not like a teaming with customers and maybe you might pay a little bit more than you do at some other places. But you could create service. They're friendly. I got to see your camera. They got tremendous selection. Whatever you're looking for, they got it. And on a way out, the guys just made you find everything you were looking forward to. You get the good service. I said great. These just thanks for coming and have a good night. Depending on what it is, their prices are as good as best buy. Well, there you go. I'm going to start shopping at Circuit City. We're very nice to me. They're last night. And you know, when, and that counts for a lot plus plus they had what I was looking for all of the merchandise. I was just getting some like cables for, you know, redoing my 85 satellite dishes and DVD and all that stuff. And, you know, a few other technical things and some cartridge and cartridges. And they had exactly what I was looking for. And they were very helpful. And what a pleasure as opposed to walking into certain stores. I don't want to mention Best Buy. Which I used to love. It was seriously Best Buy was great when they first opened. Right. And then they got too big for my bridges. You know what I mean? In other words, now, oh, you want to get waited on, well, go over there and stand by the counter and be a good boy and just don't move. Just stand there and looking about an hour or two. We'll come over with our ladder and we'll get that thing off the top shelf for you. Right. If you're lucky. But I will say that if you're buying DVDs, there's no excuse all the belly of candy. You were whining about them. Well, I don't know where to go. They've got this plenty of DVDs at Circuits City. Right. Plenty more at Best Buy. Price very nicely by the way. But don't think I don't look there. DVDs are very expensive in Toronto. If you want to watch the week to Best Buy to look at DVDs. Well, there you go. But anybody that goes to I don't want to start ripping muff because, you know, he's in such a good mood. But don't be going to blockbuster. I mean, little little kids go to blockbuster. People don't want to read that Harry Potter book. They go to blockbuster. No, you're like my second poll today. You want to know why? Well, in fact, I'm going to give it to you right now. Give it to me. Not that. Oh. Oh, see. We got the first one up because I don't want to go back to it. Is there a cut to first pull up or is he still stuck on it? Oh, the one. We got a lot of stuff. You better start moving and feed Eric. You got to keep up with me today. We got a lot of crap to do here. The second poll, which we'll get up on we're good and ready when we're done with the set of one. Which of these are you the most sick and terrible hearing about? And guess what's it? What inspired me for this poll? The first thing on here. Harry Twater. The new Harry Twater book. I, you know, I'm glad that little kids are reading books that's great. It's a wonderful thing and J.R. J.K. Rowling, whatever her name is. They had her on the other day and I'm ecstatic that she's doing so great. It's a scam. They're not good. Well, I want what I know. You're the one with the kids. Right. And I'm telling you not even good. They're not good. So, there was this is like the McDonald's of book reading. They have it. You're fluffy words like Sniffers Snack. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Holy witches. That's all they got. Yeah. That's, that's the appeal. Isn't that the story that I bought you? It's very good. And there's nothing interesting going on there. So there you go. So which of these are you the most sick and terrible hearing about the new Harry Potter book? The Hillary book. Matrix. Reality TV shows. The Middle East Roadmap. Scotland, Lacey Peterson. Weapons of mass destruction. The Florida Marlins. Golf or Neal's movie shows. That's a good one. Do I do it? I do a pull man. When I had a pull man, I had a little with Karen Love. So you believe me. Believe me. It's a wrap. I don't understand this facts at all from Andy in the Utica. How about mentioning the forget about it game? You should be able to kill an hour with it. Does forget about it game? Forget about it. I'm going to play a monopoly game. Am I going to play one night? Am I age now? No. No. All right. There you go. I plan. Lacey. It showed up. It's in a bunk. We need to see these boxes around here. It's in one of these boxes. I don't want to play it. You don't want to play it. No. So forget about it. I want to play forget about it as much as I want to read the Harry Potter book. So that's a real revelation here from George who knows his literature. He said the Harry Potter book not only is it overblown, but it sucks. How do you like that? Just like McDonald's. Same thing. See when the masses start gravitating to something, then you know it probably blows right. That's the bottom line. That's the key to keep in mind. Okay? When the masses start loving it, when the media starts hyphenate like crazy, then you know what reminds me of? What the hell is the name of that scooter thing? The segue. The segue that the presents allow for. This is going to change the way we live our life. Oh my god. Am I right? This is going to change the way that people live. They are freaking segue. It's inventing so sensational. The thing won't even tell us what it is. What it does. Where does stick it? God. Why walk when you can stand for five grand? And move from here to that wall to about half an hour. If you have good balance. I mean, what the hell are they talking about? And there's so many of you out there, man. They snap their fingers. And you're right there. All lined up ready to turn over your heart and cash. Don't forget, sleepers is a damn good movie. It was the water cash. Let me see because I gave it to him off. So I never front me. He had Brad Pitt, Dustin Hoffman, Jason Patrick. Kevin K. Bacon. Let me do it. Sorry. Well, I was listening. I think that was about it. And what's your name was in a two? What's your name? Oh yeah. With a frizzy hair. Fills dealer. Not fellas dealer. You know what I'm talking about? What's that? What's her name? You know what I'm talking about? There he goes. She was in drugs to her cowboy. Lara. No, no, no. You know who the hell was in it? Go run any other woman get the box from tough. Okay. Me and a boy get the guy damn box. Oh, I wouldn't see him over. That's right. He's he's got to go out and check with a belly parking guy. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. It's car wash. This is the only punk ever known in my life who it makes a major project of the giving it. It's car wash. God is he for that. Did you like him out? No. Yeah, how you didn't. Anyway, wait till I get to this piece here. This and I don't want to get the mad dog upset him because we get along so great. But there's a thing that I must disagree. I did not just bring it in here real quick. Okay. Just bring it in here. Don't make a big project out of this and then give it back to that man. Okay. So I got with the glasses that was laughing his ass off. Who's in this now? Oh, look at the size of that print. Oh What's your name? Mini driver. Oh, that many drivers that many driver. She's good. She was good in this. I mean, she and her role was like not, you know Suspice by tack. And then she was kind of like in a background. But she was good. Wasn't many driver in the drugstore cowboy? Am I dreaming that you're dreaming that? Yes, she was. She was. She was not. What was the other movie she was and I just got through a scene? I don't know. I don't know. Hardly you knew. Good. We're hunting like I said, but you didn't say it's not mad. Damon was in. I think he's a fact. It was you know that Damon was in that movie that I can't think of the name of with a point of identity with who that other one will find out. It's good movie. About the Gulf War. Oh, really? Well, you were a hype in before right. I can't think of the name of it. I like my team a lot. But anyway, so many drivers in this and I mentioned all the other ones in the denier on it. It's give it back to the up because if you hang out, it would he'll never see it again. I need to rely. Excellent movie. How come nobody ever mentioned that before? We forgot what a cast. How can you forget what a cast like that? Yeah, like I'm a schmuck. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless long. We're going to take a look at that hot couple's contest. The votes are pouring in on that thing. I mean just pouring in and some of them even real. Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word out of all of the English words that begin with a letter F. Because the only word that is referred to as the F word it's the one magical word. Just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. As most words in the English language is derived from German, the word frequently which means to strike. In English, f*** falls into many grammatical categories as a transit of verb, for instance, John F*** surely. His meaning is not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective, such as John's doing all the f***ing work. As part of an adverb, surely talks to f***ing much. As an adverb, enhancing, and adjective, surely is f***ing beautiful. As a noun, I don't give a f***. That's part of a word, absolutely f***ing loosely, or in f***ing credible. And as almost every word in a sentence, f***ing f***ing f***ing. As you must realize there aren't too many words with the verse of telephoto f***. As in these examples describing situations such as fraud, I got f***ing the used carolot. This may, off f*** it. Trouble. I guess I'm really f***ing now. A aggression. Don't f*** with me, buddy. This missile. Why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself? I'm sure you can think of many more examples. Say it loudly and proudly. F*** you. Absolutely. 14 till 11 at 5.64. Beena boy, more problems. Somebody in the building had a one-man centimmy by name, but somebody gave him something to put in his computer and it, you know, screwed you. Scoot your computer all up. So we're going to have a wait for the bedtime stories now, and that damn beautiful declaration thing that I mentioned before, have to wait till he's good and ready, till he can sort out his life. Why do you let these people do these things? Don't you understand the sanctity of this whole operation here and you're letting people from the outside pollute our website? Dittle with our middle? Throw them with them. What have you started? You haven't done a very good job explaining to him how important these things are to me and how aggravated I get, especially like when I f***ing hold much of stories of other clock on Saturday morning and about two o'clock the next morning they wind up on our website. I will do it again. Here's we already got a lot of votes on this pool which is amazing to me. 113 votes which picture on our website do you like best? Scorley Mo 21, Musclebound Neal God. Dittle good. 20. Titty picks on a hot couple of contests. 19. Most screws Neal, O'L Swing and Mo 18. It's a good battle here. I hate all them 15. I hate all of them 15. Mo and Geldy 12. Mo's O' the clown four. I thought would not Moza would have been better than that. I thought morphing Mozo that morphs from just plain old fruity clearance and the beast three and hereless toothless mo only one. I thought that was a work of art. The one that preceded the Mozo with the missing hair and the missing teeth. Sure. But that was asked to finish. That's only got one vote. Well that's the first 113. Okay. That's we're off to the races till noon with that pool and then we'll get to this other one. I think there's going to be a lot of people take issue with you and I'd Harry Potter thing. I could be wrong. I think they're getting really pissed off and fired up about those comments you made. Okay. Let me take a peek and we don't have to dwell on this because you got until Monday morning a 10 o'clock. The hot couple's contest, Frank and Liz have varied the competition. They've got a shovel out and they just dug a big hole and they're in there with Sheridan and the rats and those bananas. Frank and Liz got 858 votes. Greg and Stephanie have moved into second. It's very, very tight for second place which of course is important because the really two good prizes are one and two. Am I right? Right. Greg and Stephanie 392 and right on their ass Brian and Natasha 388. So it's only a four vote spread. Speaking of spread, Mary and Shane 274. It's a long ways to how he endearing 271. Mike and Kristen 250. Ian and Jen 223. Danny and Michelle 175. Captain Singham is wife 131. Vicki and Mick 124. Dan and Sherry 65. Rich and Cheryl 55 and Jody and Kevin with that Cp atone. Have only 27 bad photography. Right. Right. I'm going to be just don't like them. I don't know. But anyway, they only got 27 out of 3233 votes. Pretty damn impressive since we ever delayed a whole day and as Niggas started until Tuesday morning. Right. Right. 3233. So we've already surpassed last contest total and in that contest we had Amy and Erin. I just mentioned in passing which was no small potatoes and I'll see it again. I saw your lady on channel seven again this morning. She still looks like a monkey. She did not look good. She still got a monkey post. Jackie, what's your name? Johnson. Jackie's Johnson? I don't know if she had one. I mean she's okay. I'm not saying she's the ugliest bitch ever seen in my life. But she is not you people out there. You guys are really desperate. Uh-huh. I'm I'm Tonya. Like George. And that's the reason that you're so foaming at the mouth about Jackie Johnson. You can go out of the guy damn song rest mall right now. The Broward Mall, Dayland. Oh yeah, any place. And within two minutes, you'll see 15 beautiful luscious babes who make Jackie Johnson look like a bottom of Clarence's Anis. I'm I'm Tonya. She's just not that great. I'm not saying she might be the very very nice person. Huh? I don't know. Or not. She may be a bitch. I don't know. Or she. And I'm not saying she's grotesque. But when you look, when you're gonna make a fuss about somebody like I did you about Brittany when she was on a cover while he's stolen like two years ago and you didn't know her from God damn broccoli spirit. And you're in so holy crafty old man's right. Take a look at that. Take a look at those. Yeah. That's right. Fussworthy. You've heard of a Jeff Foxworthy. How about finding somebody who's fussworthy? When I can make a fuss about Tom Brady for crying out loud, that's because he's worth fussing over and with. I'd like to fuss with it. But uh huh? That's what you need to make a fuss. No. And what about that in folky guys? Is that in Rikai? Now listen, here's here's an article and I don't want to dwell on a cause I don't know nobody cares, but it's just in the mad dog today's doing a show out at the Hooters and Pepper Pines 2 to 4. Hank 4 to 7 in the studio at the Marlins of the Tampa Day, a bay devil right? Oh my god. Pretty embarrassing. Two teams that have no business been in business. But the mad dog has got on his show as his guest and he doesn't do guests. Right? He hates guests, but Don 12 will us and I apologize I had no idea who that was because I don't follow the Marlins. So the other day I said who the hell is that a basketball guy? It sounds like a basketball name. Doesn't it? Don 12? You don't have no baseball guys named Don 12, but you do now. He's the 21 year old black hit. It's the great Marlins pitcher. The pizza one hit or Monday night against the match. Okay. So here's the deal. Mad dog's going to be talking with him. I guess he won't be a guest. He'll be just be shmoosen. I'll make it okay. Okay. Right. But there's an article in the Herald this morning in the sports section. It says, and I heard the mad dog say yesterday, this is what inspired me to mention this. That now people have a reason to go out to the ballpark. In other words, and this suggesting once again, we've been down this road a million times, you know, over and over and over and over. Maybe not a million, but yeah, times first it was going to be Alex Fernandez because of his Hispanic roots. And then it was going to be this one. And then it was going to be that one. And it was going to never happen. Never paned out. There weren't three extra people in there. So maybe Ferrell was in there with a bunch of scancet net night. But it says TV ratings are way up every time Willis pitches. But he hasn't had any impact on attendance. Monday when he pitched that one hit or against the match. As you know, the attendance was 10,624. And again, keep in mind, these numbers are bogus. They're over their inflated. In his previous started pro player statement, two nothing shut out of the Oakland A's. He do the smallest crowd in the six game stretch 10,000 140 95 year old manager Jack McKeean says he's getting some national attention. The TV ratings are starting to go up. But he hasn't had a big crowd here. Saturday night by the way, we'll be pitching here against the devil raised. There's one good reason to go out there and see it, but they won't. I don't think. Willi. No. And George, though, he would have what I'm talking about. But he knows the answer. See, you don't have to know the question. But if you know the right answer, that's what counts. Like on a quishio. And the answer is, no, right. That's the correct answer. So, you know, all you people don't want to keep trying, oh, that's going to be great. They're going to be coming out there. They're going to be standing online. And it's going to be like the line that for Elhead here yesterday or two days ago. Five. That McGill boy, talk about any emotional spickman comes rich rushing into, well, they're lining up. There's a line out here. And I envision, I don't know about you, but I envision there's like a hole because, you know, how many times have I been involved in these radio things where they invite people to come down like it like it's data? So actually it was before it was I-95. And they got into a whole big scene with that for Elhead. Love that because they invited kids to come down and they're underwear. And they were given away tickets for concert. You know, it was like right. Since nighttime show. Yeah, teenage years. You know, nine year old. No, not little kids. That little kid's. Punks, teenage kids. You know, come down in your underwear. We got tickets for some, what was concert. And they did. They showed up in your underwear. And then, of course, somebody called a cops and a cops came into the building. And it was like a whole big scene in the song of the end. And it was great. And they got about $50 million worth of publicity from it. But there were a number of people in the building was unbelievable because I was already on the other end of the building on I and Z at that time doing nights. Now, did I go and take a peek? Not to me. Well, of course not. Pairs go. Yes, I did. But I mean, they were like a zillion kids in there. Okay. There were a lot of people. But here there was like five people lined up and Miguel actually like, oh my god, you wouldn't believe it. Oh, we had to magnify. Yeah. All the results like the with the polls kind of like most ratings. We have to multiply times three and add a couple extra points and then go set up a little bit and then check their herpes. Oh, speaking of herpes, if you we should, you should have tape when he wasn't looking. You should tape the visas morning talking about that bogus dreamy claimed. claimed he had a dream. He ran into Mo on a park and lied had a big verbal brawl with him. Yank the wig off his head ran over to Kentucky fried and Mo chased him over to Kentucky fried. I mean, what kind of crap was he sucking on at the ballgame the other night to beast? Huh? He must have been sucking on some illegal jungle juice or something because he was just crazy as a bedbug, more so than usual. Because I walked into middle of an I thought, what what happened that I missed a dream? He had a dream. I think we're got him emotional as when we started showing those pictures in clearance and that love and that lip lock. Oh my god, and wait till you people see that new one. Now, if you got this thing going or not, no. What is he saying? Half a half. That means no. See, this is another good reason for me not to be here. I mean, the fact that I have to watch this, that I have to be expected to this grow test episode again. Day after day after day, I lost my keys, my valley key doesn't work. Timmy has stuck something in my slot and now it's all screwed up. Well, just on and on and on and the best part but he doesn't care because he got laid last night and paid today. Payed today, laid last night of man who's got his priorities in order. Oh, you're never going to pay. You'll never pay. Well, we've searched so long with dizzy. If he's alive, we're dizzy. It's driving us insane. Where and can my fortune can he that's one Honda catch Iraki where the hell's the Donald saying? Is the unamaged event of any changes gender at a hospital in Spain? All they believe didn't try to swap his holes for all the China where the hell's the Donald saying? I'm like, we are sick and play, make it right, we're not good guys. What does that thought really kind of make you sick? Smith golf my way. I'm kind of sorry. He's a loose assi and cunning. The dictator keeps running without his candy cane. He still looks every and early but his voice is kind of girly where the hell's the Donald saying? Well, I like the ending on that. That's a beautiful thing. This is disgusting. The what what Ken think it says the mother of a K-team from Queens is suing the city. Same with girl was humiliated and harassed after wearing a Barbie is a lesbian t-shirt to school. In the suit filed yesterday in Manhattan Federal Court Kathleen Hodges accused the city officials at middle school 210 in ozone park a failing to protect her daughter Natalie young 14. The lawsuit would cease unspecified damages says that Natalie's right to free speech was violated when she was sent home last year and more and she'd be suspended if she wore the t-shirt to school again. I try to be funny she told the daily news. I've worth assured to many other places and people always saw humor in it But it was no joke to teach her John Mason who called the shirt inappropriate ridicule Natalie in front of her classmates April 10th of last year coin to the lawsuit. Natalie was then escorted out of class brought to acting principal John calories office where she was held for three hours before being sent home for the rest of the day. She was removed and detained solely on the basis of an arbitrary and big interview of a team of school administrators said attorney Ronald Kubey who's representing Natalie. The lawsuit also charges to Natalie with the once ordered Remove Rainbow colored beads from her hair and was told by a school counselor it was not normal for her to ask girls out like on dates Okay Well why not if she's a dick what would they she's supposed to ask God I like a monkey the pee teacher. Oh Probably what things so if I probably just about any teacher of the female persuasion Okay, we got a couple of problems a McGirlas crawled around on a floor in there Which I don't want to tell you the details, but there's some I mean being a boy similar Different body same mentality different body. Oh, by the way McGirlas always liked him.

Uh-huh. We smell that before and hopefully that we never smell it again Here's another fact that says hold on your seat Jackie Johnson is extremely overrated underline several times Two TV hoties are Lisa Patrillo and Glenn and Millbury is one of those the ablanum thinking about See I don't know the names because the news here on TV is so bad. I enjoy a CFTO and Toronto so much I'm of course it's a much bigger market but I mean like professional news people you know Like a real newscast as supposed that I'm here with like you know grandma's I mean I'll tell you I tried watching six because we do like Joe Rose especially after last Saturday's performance when he bitched out mo You know what I mean? Absolutely but What's your name? Jennifer sloppy Velapi Yeah, I can't deal with her. I can't stand her. She's got an ego bigger than the whole town I did one time say something nice about that travel series. She did on travel channel when they were schlepping her all through Italy That was a good series and then she sent me kind of like a very formal stiff You know, thank you for the nice comments. It's sticking up your ass. You remember that She thinks her stuff don't stay her in the Tony cigarette And of course, could you take him seriously? It's like when they made Cambrella remember our channel four right used to be six They made Cambrella Martian a news guy I mean Is there anybody Anybody would take him seriously? No, I'm much less I'm just talking to see him and being much less than who no Cambrella my nice guy, but give me a break And that's the big thing in his town first you're a sports dude. Then you're a news guy. Yeah Tony cigaretteo silly Tony And The problem is because these people smooth with everybody in the business and they have all of these you know like Hank and mad dog and Jimmy Siffles and all these guys in cigaretteo. There are all of these football shows you know on four and six and ten and it They're like it's like a little fraternity so that they doesn't say nothing negative about each other If I don't say but I have no a Instagram one way or the other So I will just tell you right now. I can't stand channel six news. I think it blows it blows Channel seven news. We know blows big time channel four isn't even I wouldn't even dignify by calling a newscast Now that they brought tackling Angela Ray back from New York Don't play that please. I'll make me nausea. Absolutely. So what does that leave you leave you channel 10 I don't want to see a bad guy. I know is eating a ass. You know I don't want to see that Spad enough I have to see George in here all the time because we know he's eating ass Police I'm not here most of the time but I'm sure I got much right in waterdale Since he shaved the mustache off. He looks about 20 years older and he looks like he looks like like Steppenfetched He's ridiculous. You know think he's ridiculous. I can see it in such a long time and And don't give me a saw that it's about me talking about how other people look that crap again because I'm not on television I have a face at a body for radio. I know my place Yeah, I belong on radio not on television who I would want to look at my post God what a thought so I just put it up on the bulletin board then what's that your post Because a lot of people are interested especially now that and for else it I had the most beautiful one in history It's red. Oh and guess who we got a a facts from who's having lunch with fat boy. I don't want to see See from here. Okay See it wasn't just kind of Lisa. We're gonna do mm like that We're just gonna do a lot of stuff like pretty soon Like you know that Jackie Johnson she likes hmm according to Joe Rose Really yeah Joe said right Absolutely five six seven oh five sixty so we got Jackie Johnson going here today and we also got Perry's Potter Where's that damn thing I got all my bedtime stories screwed up here. Oh, you know, I do want to do this please This gives us a little bit of hope Senate panel and this will be on our website if Vibina is it We got that straight out as a go and like full force now where I know Men's of insa it's going slowly slowly. Well surely we'll get a minor when he's good ready Unless he gets a chance to get laid again before noon like maybe if clearance comes in here and drop some Senate panel passes build over a rule FCC media ownership rules a Senate panel voted yesterday to overturn decision by FCC that would loosen restrictions on US media ownership to Senate commerce committee the decision now goes before the full Senate But it is not clear if there are enough votes to pass the bill and either the Senator to the House However Several Republicans have joined with Democrats in opposing the FCC rules which do not need congressional approval It can be effectively vetoed by Congress. That's the good news. We got our fingers and legs crossed and they know the details It's on our website to all story. I just thought I would mention that a little bit of good news a little bit of hope a little bit of hope Maybe That goddamn colon poll junior their Michael Powell the chairman of the FCC and all these other two Republican Nazis are Gonna just hand a key to the kingdom over to the Lower Maze in a clear channel Great read was just in here by the way first time I seen greater log time and he said right Hey, you yeah, mention something about you again Now actually he seemed to be in a pretty good mood He's real happy he loves for a man. He's got blow up dollars. He's got the whole deal. He loves Ryan rightfully so I mean, you know you watch Greg's stumble and fumble and bumble along and screw up all sorts of things and then finally It's like my old axiom there if you throw enough crap up any or some middle come back and hit the ground it'll stick and I think this stuck So far and of course it's sticky It is very sticky on a feral shell. That's what they said at the ballpark too a lot of rumors about that Oh, I should have mentioned that earlier all that history that was going on in here yesterday and be in a voice Start in all these rumors. Oh, this better not get out in the air. Oh, there was there was no big deal there For all us throw on the first pitch out of the game on Sunday to never read game. They're not pissed off at him There were a couple of bimbosts in there a couple of those skanky bras, which I better not say that because that's his sponsor But yeah a couple of them well he talked about it with the you know the banana of brews on a race But And I guess they were doing a few things a little bit over the line if you catch my grap little over the edge The baseline yeah over the baseline and in fact that picture we're talking about before I think maybe they were like kind of flashing that to the crowd and they said well there's a whole bunch of kids in here And we don't want them to get to wrong impression of what that things really like so we better not let them take a look at that no mole And they dragged their ass out of there but other than that a great time was had by all tough even tough was in you know how panicky she He gets I mean he's a nervous nellie literally But he went and after the show yesterday. He said now to Marlins weren't unhappy everybody's it's great It was a major happening there at the ballpark I mean when a guy can bring in an extra two 300 people and it's only 10,000 or 11,000 ballpark keep in mind It was 11,000 on Wednesday, but that's inflated because it wasn't a TV game So there was bound to be extra people because it was not on TV as opposed to if it's on TV you get it for free Like no matter who's picture with a rits a down trail or whoever they'll let it chant tell So the we just took a survey and we decided Jackie Johnson's like a shadow of what everybody claims on his station all the sports nerds See I guess they feel compelled I'd like to find out off there what they really think about Jackie's Johnson, you know Okay, I get no serious survey leave it to me because I have nothing losing that category I can go on here and say hi, I think she's marginal. I mean right and again I'm not talking personal sweetheart. You may be a very very nice lady You may be just a sweetheart. I don't know and I really don't care quite frankly But that's not what we're talking about the fact is she's been built up to me this wow Really hot piece and I got news for if I were in that persuasion I wouldn't be all that excited about her Okay, there's there are bigger fish to There are Figure and bigger and hotter fish in the better glasses. That's the like her. Okay. I'm I look I'm not trying to dissuade you okay because I know you're in in Tough times WQA Nobody there WQA. I'm hello Oh, Neil Harry Potter Jackie Johnson line.

So little jury is tries to get a different format in the facts. You're still as work jury or whatever it is, your name is. You're still an asshole. Anyway, here's a facts from Bill who says, Why didn't know if you're going to have another hot couple context after this one? We missed it in the last time. Good news for you, we have a ability at Syngelai. In July with the same nithy prizes, the same tips to the Bahamas, and or Jamaica, or whatever. We'll have some good stuff. Also, fill in mugge, you generally are pretty good facts, you're butt. Remember I told you before the show he facts me this? See, I understand that a lot of you folks, unfortunately, the only resource you have is the local fish wrappers. And your local fish wrappers have stories a day and sometimes several days after they appear elsewhere. Like they got to call me yesterday about Norma Kent. And then I heard Mad Dog talking about the Marlins and the Gay advertising, the Enoos and the Enoos. I talked about that last week, last week I had that story. And now it magically appears a week later in the local fish wrappers yesterday. And right away, like, oh, how come you're not talking about that? Because I talked about it last week, where way ahead, and spite a little Tommy Jickus and about a touch with what's going on. I'm touching it, man, as much as I can. Why let's get in the way of perfectly good war by area and a huffington. It was on our website yesterday. And it's in the Sun Sentinel today, just like the Marine dog columns that you're up a day or two later in the local papers from after the New York Times and on our website the same day. The same day that they were in the times. That's when they're in our website, just like the Nick Christoph and the Paul Cruckman column today will be on their feet of warrior against his computer fix. Now, what is the, what's the story? Seriously, I would like to report because I'm watching his behavior. And I'm, he's lighting incense. He's farting all over the place. What is the story? Give me an update. Well, I'm not saying that ahead anything to do with high boy, but this, but high boy, he wasn't even in there. Hi, apparently. What have any cuts of my bad machines? Something happened because the stench got pretty bad pretty quick. Oh, no, that's what. So. It could have been George for all I know. Oh, no, I think more likely you had to write the first time. Some software, I'll do. Some software that we wanted to use to burn a CD for use, so you can take with you today or tomorrow or whatever you leave. Wasn't stalled on this laptop. And obviously my laptop hates us off. We're so badly. Yes. That it's trying to spit it out of every orifice that it has. Yeah. And I'm doing my best to fight it. Speaking of, hi, apparently. Now, who did I just mention? By the way, a little jury quit the way she might have experienced. Again, you just can't get rid of these people. I'll be so ecstatic to be out here. So I don't have to see this crap. Somebody's neighbor, which I don't want to mention. Oh, yeah, apparently. Again, sending me a bios and picture the great revenge of in BDL. That same person that said that they wouldn't be vaccine anymore. The same one that promised us they wouldn't be fasting us anymore. We hate him like poism. We don't want to be bothered by him just because he's somebody's neighbor. Oh, yeah, apparently. He was just wandering around and hearing smell the place up real bad. See, that's one thing about people who are very, very obese. Generally, they're personal hygiene. I'm not talking about me, a little Pudge you want to like me. I'm talking about people that are gigantic big tubs of crap. It's a matter of physics. They're just places they can't read. Or do they have to take physics? I would think with as much as they be like on a pot half a day. There are folds. They can't get in between. Like how you're folds? So anyway, a fat boy's done to join up in his neighbor. Don't ever fax us again. And of course, you won't be forward in them anyways. So at least they're just waiting for one. They're like, right in the guy. Even if that's the bad side, why are you wasting our paper? You know I'm not going to forward any facts as bad. He's a part of it. I'm sorry. I understand. I know I won't be faxing anymore. What is wrong with those people? Where do we start? It's like they think that I'm doing the show for them. It's like it's like just men and men. Like me and them. I say something and then they respond. And then they fax again. And I'm supposed to read that. And then they respond again. And on. And me while nobody in the audience gives a flying crap about those people. I have to. Who do I'm saying? By the way, fat boy, nice to see you. But you're stuck to join up real bad. Don't come in here again until I can't leave. That would be a good poll question. Which QAM celebrity stuck to most Josh Friedman's square and or fat boy? That would be good. Josh Friedman hands down. Oh look at this. Here's a facts from somebody named Josh. But I'm sure it's not the archaosh. Either one of them. It says put a link on to this website. Good stuff. Move on dot org slash distortions slash missley dot pdf. It was ned the New York Times. Okay. I'll stick that right over here. Okay. And you can prove that at your. At your leisure after you're finished with your nervous breakdown of a nobody computer. We apologize to the audience at being a boy's having a change of life today because you got laid 15 times last night. Actually, I don't think it was four. I think it was more like. But turn man. Which picture on our website. Do you like the best? That's of course because they haven't seen the new ones yet that are coming. Oh. Oh. You ain't seeing nothing yet. Well, they were coming. Well, they might be. One looked like it was about to. Three. Yeah. Was right on the edge. 347 votes which picture on our website. You like best. Scorley Mo is got 60. This is a battle. Look at that. Musclebound deal got 57. And that might change. When the new version goes up. Most screws kneel swinging. Low 57 and the energy. He's been pumping away for days. Man. That's why you don't hear him.

And hairless toothless. Mo's only got three. I. And that was one of my favorite. Right. I thought that was one of Boca Brian's greatest. Most magnificent pieces of artwork ever. And they just didn't just appreciate. Fine art. No class. WQ. M. Yes sir. Yes. Yes. Brian. I think Neil. How's it going? Great. Sensational. Chucky Johnson is a dog. Okay. Bill come on. There's a lot of otter. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. He would tell you. The blonde on Channel 6 is Martha Tagalf. She thought. Okay. I didn't know her name and I still don't. But if she's the one, yes, you're right. She is on. She's very odd. That's it. Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Pally. So there you go. So far we've had a whole bunch of people saying the Jack he's Johnson. He's so hot. It's what they're saying. But then again, the sports people on the station They tried to build up that macho women today. Obviously have to say the politically correct thing. Absolutely. Jackie Johnson. She's a fox. Yeah. Maybe the same. She's on fox because seven is like fox. That's winter. That might be it. Maybe that's what they're saying. Maybe our hearing is just bad. Jackie Johnson. She's on fox. And of course we don't like fox anyway. She eats fox. And what a box. She's on. She's on. But it was long. I didn't mean to impersonate. It was a pair long socks. And brains like a box of rocks. In fact, maybe she likes shot some Botox in her post. Maybe that's why her head is like sure. Let up like that. Maybe she got monkeypox. That rhymes with that too because her face looks like somebody said yes. They can like see that report on Botox. They did on that. I don't know. They're talking like that Botox and Jeff Shenzhen's gone wrong. Yes. Did see that. I don't want I think anybody who does that deserve it. I think you know if you do that you deserve what you get. It's like people are diabetic and you need a whole bunch of chocolate and candy and ice cream. You know like me, whatever I get all the syrup because I've been like punishing myself with cramp. Like I kid they got eaten by the alligator. Did you hear about that? deserved it. Right. They said get out of the water. There's an alligator coming. Ask for you. I know what I'm doing. Right. That's right. The beast was down there on in a hallway on all fours. I warned him. I warned him. I said you know, Clarence couldn't find squat in Omaha and sure enough he did. All I had to was say squat and he did. What does he had the beast is growing a beard now? You know, and you want to do it on the original. Before Clarence and the beast had the nut. You know where this is going. I want to go to your friend. He wants to make sure. No, no, no, it wasn't what you think. That wasn't it. Although you do have a point. He wants to have the macho image. Oh, you know, he wants to come out on top in that relationship. Thanks for steering and especially since Clarence looks so. Faye in those pictures we have a. And there a little bit like Faye Wayne if he asked me. Anyway, I'd like to be a flying wall on the night of that hunting. Well, man, five six seven. Oh, that is 60. Yeah. Good to Q.A.M. Hello.

Thanks for Martha. That belongs to this list too. The list. Are you a passing guy there? We got. We got the. How hot Jackie Johnson channel seven is. And Martha Stewart. Because the next poll question is, which of these are you? Well, you won't sick and tired of hearing what we're sick and tired of hearing about God. I didn't hear you potter and George says the book suck anyway. I thought when all those lines were flushed, you're going to get some crap on that. Which would have been good. No, they want to talk about Jackie Johnson. Well, that's okay, too. Sure. And it's not like I'm all I did. I just say yesterday and passing and then I happen to see you again this morning. Because I'm getting up right at that time on a channel seven news is on like a seven in the A.M. And I turn it on. There she is doing a weather.

Somebody facts is this. It's a full page ad from move on dot org. Win without war. And here's the picture of our misleader. That's the headline misleader. It says we want to truth now. America, where are we to run a president who warned of the imminent danger of weapons of us destruction. Who promised the evidence for such weapons was incontroredible. Now, once later, no weapons have been found. Worst, the evidence suggested intelligence reports were deliberately misred. That the American people were deliberately misled. It will be a tragedy of young men and women were sent to die for a lie. Call your representative and send it to us now to man independent commission to determine the truth. Move on dot org. You can get more on their website. Move on dot org. Thank you very much. Oh god. Regular listener in Miami says this morning, guilty city went back to the gas station to return the 10 bucks. But when he told the guy that he made a mistake and gave guilty next to $10, the guy said, No, I didn't. So guess what, guilty kept the 10 bucks. There you go. Let me see this too. If somebody, I mean, if you have an IQ larger than your thumbnail. And you have a transaction. I'm not talking about thousands of dollars even hundreds of dollars. If you have a transaction like under 20 bucks. You know if somebody gave you $10 too much change. Yeah, even if it's very early in the morning, you were a little groggy. Haven't had your cup of coffee yet. Uh, you know, it's happened. Sure. Now, that sounds really lame. I don't want to pick on Galdé because he's, you know, got a cover as asked where things are going on at you. You think he's lying? About what? About that story? I don't know. All I do know is that at the moment, the time that it happened. That's the time you say, Oh, pal, you made a mistake. Give me 10 bucks too much. See, it's only. And right there, and then at that moment. Yeah, the guy knows. Sure. Now, maybe the guy is maybe to embarrassed to take the nubux back. Maybe he heard about it on a radio or somebody heard about it and went in. Told me he's like, again, embarrassed. Something like that. But if somebody gives you 10 bucks too much change, you know it. Sure. And the honorable thing to do is not to go on here like some kind of a pipsqueak and squeak in. And I was like, what do you think I should do? What should I do? What's it? Look for a job. Oh, he already is. By the way, he's still driving a show. He's doing, he's coming out of the breaks out of the rejoins. He's doing a time checks and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And more is just like how to mumble it in the background. He's like the background man. No, no, just just like that. That's exactly what he was doing this morning. Sounded the main. Absolutely. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, probably not get any comment about your Harry Potter, so maybe you're right. I'm sure you are right on that one. Don't forget join Mark of the June Mark show 6 to 8 tonight at the South World of Fashion. What is it? South Florida Fairgrounds. 1967, 7, Boulevard, West Palm Beach from Marlon, I used car sales event. Stop out of win Marlon tickets. It's another very, very minimal QM prizes. And the beast. We'll be out tomorrow afternoon from noon. They'll two at the Grand Opening West Marine. Located at 2300 South federal highway. In four Latterdale, stop by to win prizes. Enjoy free food from Atlantic City. So I'm going to tell you something. If Mark from the June Mark show and the beast can be out to an appearances, how come Bina boys not doing some? It does some. Not all by himself. You mean like with you? Right. Like a tag along or on he pinched hits for Miguel. Sometimes it gets the promotion. He pinched hits with me. For example, the Bill's side all appearance on Saturday. He's going to be getting paid to go there. Yeah. No more time is that thing. 11 to one. So that means like when I facts him, what day is that? 28th. 28th. So when I facts him the stories on that day, 11 o'clock, he won't be there. Right. He won't be there. Yeah. So that means that the people on that Saturday who are going to be waiting breathlessly for those fantastic, important world-breaking, bedtime stories that we have on our website. We'll have to wait till after he gets his ass home. Hopefully he finds a key to his apartment. Hopefully he gets an okay and confide his computer and it wasn't eaten by. He's a monkey overnight. If he doesn't run out of gas, if he doesn't run out of gas, and isn't hijacked by some deadbeat on the list. Yeah. Okay. What's more important than you make the money, okay? Or he says you can tax them by nine. Oh, I could do that. I just didn't know how early you get up. He doesn't sleep. Well, that's right. He's busy getting late all night. I forgot about that. And treating that melanoma. 399 votes. The next one will make 400. I don't want to read it until we get 400. Okay. Let me refresh it here on my very, very. And I will say that this computer is working pretty damn good since I've had back. Thank God. You have any problems while I was, uh, no. No. What happened in here that we straighten this out? Don't you remember? Was it because I bought a new computer? I bought a new computer. Please don't remind me. Okay. Hey, remember? No. Not when you're this old. And you know something. Now just out of spite. Nobody else will vote on this. So I can get to 400. You people are brutal, man. If they had any. Well, I'm sure they do because they can tell in the sound of my voice. There's the 400 vote. Which picture on our website you like the best? Squorley, Moe, Adam, Swing and Nuts 74. They love those nuts like the Beast Eyes. Most screws kneel, Swing and Moe, 66. He keeps on slinging and he's really swinging. And if he or she's usually slinging, muscle bound Neil God 65, which is going to make a big improvement. When you see it over the weekend, it's going to take a turn for the best. Titty picks on the hot couple contest, 57. More than 40, too. Moe's another clown 28. Fruity Clarence in the Beast only nine. That's one of our very favorites. And the new Fruity Clarence in the Beast. That one will put you into orbit. Believe you. And the hairless Tuffless Moe only have four. It's always God. I guess they like Moe better with that nice piece on his head. Absolutely. He's a what? Crap. 560, 505, 60, pound 560 on the AT&T. I got to be honest with you. I realized it's only afternoon. I should have learned a long time ago. Don't press your luck. Like an awful game show. But for a Friday when there's nobody here, we've done magnificently well. I mean, not spectacularly. We had the retire. We had that guy. And we had Chamba. And we got them out of the way. And since then, we've actually had a few people on this full with something to say. Probably because we had something very important to talk about. And that's Jackie Johnson. Right? Right? But she may not look the best, but she certainly is a high. She may not have a hot body, but she's got a hot topic. There you go. My favorite clothing store. Is hot topic. That's an image of a store. Yeah. Absolutely. About the shirt there. I'll be damned. WDQAM. Between the comic craft. Oh, brother. WDQAM. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. I've got a jirbel in my air. Oh. There's something he's just a little bit too much. A little over the top. And what did I just get to say? I was saying, you know what I just said is that's right up here again. And Neil's psychic powers once again. Once again. No one already went. No one. That's right. He was already on there. Both of them. Five six seven. Oh, five sixty. Have we had any women called today? Oh. This has been, I would say. The worst week for female callers. Now what about the ladies out there? What do they think about Jackie Johnson? They should have an idea of what a nice female looks like. Unless they're looking in the mirror. Right? No, they're always. And Harry Potter. You think that every mother out there in a audience would be just bitching your ass. No, they're going to call in a gray. I hope they are. The mothers like. I saw something. I saw something at home from beat Dalton and the borders. Who are there? Why don't you just talk to me? Because they're little kids. Bitched and mone. It said, mommy, me, does he like it? It's great. He's the one who needs to be. He's the one who needs to be. Why is no, not seeing how anybody's doing in there. He hasn't seen the picture yet. Has he seen the picture? The new clearance? No, he's working on it. Oh, yeah. It's believe me. You've never looked lovely or trust me when I tell you. Let's see. Please read this for all colors and listeners. Dear Neil Rogers Show, listeners and colors, let's try to deliver some funny interesting material for Neil and his show. Honestly, believe that we make funny phone calls and good faxes. It'll make Neil and George laugh. We'll automatically motivate them to continue the fun energy that his show has. Thanks Neil for reading this. Craig from downtown, maybe is where you are better in Miami. Anthony and North Miami will guess what Anthony have a great life. Oh, these are all from the same person. They must be. Huh? This is from Clel from Homestead. These are gotta be from the Netherlands. That's even more frightening. It says enjoy the show without you get a kick out of these awards, especially the five star stupidity award. Where is it? Oh, this is just stuff I don't have time for, okay? Don't have time to read these long pond restings. I'm going to give it a thank you so much, Amy. Thanks for the thought. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16. Did you get that up there for me? I don't know. You still haven't seen it? Get with it. WQAM. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. Good afternoon. When did you parole? Has anyone mentioned anything about her? Who? When did you parole on a channel six? Don't know who it is. How did she do? She's very hot. Mahakam, nobody talks about these other chicks. They're always screaming about Jackie's Johnson. Jackie, again, just another pretty face. When you parole, she's got some serious, serious shirtful. Good. Don't have your head. He doesn't talk about her. But he has to talk about the least. He said she's got a big, something like that. Neil, question for you. I know you have direct TV. When you get your direct TV, you build. You ever like check it out? No. No. Can you get any idea how much cats we're paying now on the satellite. I want to tell you this, I hate direct TV. Okay, despite direct TV. I really do. I hate it. And why? Why? Because it sucks because my digital cable in Toronto has got to beat hands down. I got like 800 real channels on my digital cable because my direct TV box, you know, the woman they record or what do they call it? The, uh, the old, old TV. Well, it's not. That's not a team. It's that same thing though. I have all that. That is the biggest pain in the ass like this morning. I get up and and if a bird, forget about rain. But if a bird farts at a sky right away, the thing goes out. You got to unplug it and plug it back in again. We said it. It's the biggest pain in the ass of any piece of equipment I've ever had. My life I'd despise direct TV. I hate it. Well, I got the ultimate TV receiver a couple of years ago based on you talking about it. Yeah, I'm sorry. You're all right. I am losing my picture. I hell of a lot more. Yeah. I don't have to reset it. I'm sorry. I did that to you if I would only know. But anyway, I mean, I got my ability other day like 150 dollars. Because I could have a sports pack. You just know the football right now. I get them all. And now it's like, I'm getting a 20 dollar, it's 20 dollars. It's 20 dollars on like 140 something to all the bills. I'll say why. And they're saying, well, I'm sure you see on your screen as it's white, that like, kind of in California and based on the Florida legislation. It's like taxes from 6% to 13% the satellite and in your right. The expenses are going to go through the friggin' room. I would take the damn receiver and put it out in the bottom of the pool as well. I would do this. I'm serious. Just out of protest. Good luck. Good luck. Problem is past noon. He may be feel bad because I turned him onto that ultimate TV thing for the director of the work. I think it's really the Todd. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. We got some heavy duty stuff. It's going to be on our website over the weekend, including the brand new Clarence and Beast picture. It is a lovely thing. Preview for their wedding night in July, July 10th. Is that today? That is. And we're going to send them all expenses paid to Maui. It's going to be old Maui and Maui. And the two of them are going to be in heaven and hog heaven. At least one of them anyway. And Clarence has never looked so lovely and feminine as he does in that picture. He's the bride with that lovely lay. Oh, there is no question about that. That's why he's growing a beard. He's going to wear the pants in that family. Big big big ones. Extra big one. Poulas opants. Yeah. Zuba's pants. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. W. The Neil deals keep rolling out from our good friends. Tom Lemon and Joe Prieto at Hall of Pontiac GMC like right now.

pot smoking revelers party outside Toronto's downtown police headquarters yesterday smoking their joints, bombs and pipes without being harassed by a single police officer streams of sweet smoke walked into the air as cannabis crusader Mark Emory of Vancouver resident handed out joints to fellow potentus just urged them to exercise their law for right to possess marriage a we need marijuana is legal in Ontario to possess and it's permissible underlaw to smoke marijuana anywhere that is permissible to smoke tobacco in Ontario Emory said calling the province the freeest jurisdiction in the western world with recent court challenges of pot laws and the acceptance of game marriages although event was right on police property no uniformed officers were seen among the crowd inside headquarters policing this interested with the party and no officers make available the comment I trust if the police wanted to apprehend our path that could have done so I'm recited a not so subtle challenge to police I thought the most provocative places smoke marijuana with others would be right in front of the police chief's doorstep police organizations in Ontario have said they will not lay charges for possession marijuana under 30 grams until the counties countries muddled pot laws are clarified 30 grams now how I thought it was like 20 joints is 30 grams of that if you're right let me go get my scale I think you're heard how fat you rolled the fat in these were pretty fat like sure they were short fat ones too we're not talking about in the Toronto star newspaper 30 grams is an else more less yeah and how many joints can you roll out of an ounce about 30 really about 30 man well there you go that should be enough for a couple of hours right so there are even hours of

I'm sure it's not him or them. I didn't say it was. I should just ask out of curiosity what the deal is. I mean, this is the kind of place you wouldn't anticipate people just wandering around just that kind of a place. McDonald's asked me industry to cut the use of antibiotics. We spotted the public health concerns about the overuse of antibiotics in farm animals. The McDonald's corporation said yesterday that it would ask its meat supplies around the world. We reduced their dependence on antibiotics. McDonald said that expected it suppliers to face out the use of some antibiotics that promote growth and healthy animals. And it's significant reduced use of other antibiotics that typically protect animals against disease. It said it's making the change because of growing evidence that the use of antibiotics in farm animals was creating antibiotic resistance in animals and in the bacteria that caused disease in humans. So in other words, if you didn't have big max. You could pop like 50,000 penicillin tablets or tetracycling or whatever. It would be a risk for a risk for a box of cillin. Exactly. And when do you know good? Industry officials said McDonald's decision would likely help out of the way animals are raised around the world because McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain. One of the world's biggest purchases of meat and one of the biggest perveres obviously up to this time of antibiotics that you didn't know you were getting into one of the first place. And speaking of Canada. Detroit. Americans visit border town to take advantage of a new gay marriage law. Gay American couples are being in the head for the port city of Windsor on terio. How's my good buddy Marty Adler doing? To take advantage of Ontario's court-ordered legislation of same-sex marriages. By yesterday morning, 13 gay couples three of them America had a granted marriage licenses in Windsor. Suburban Detroit residents Jennifer Patty and Erin James are among those planning to head to Windsor just to cross their from Detroit to seek emerge license. They just need to do some paperwork required in Canada certifying James divorce 15 years ago. We've waited this long. We can wait a little longer. Patty told the Detroit news. How do you like that? They're pouring across the border. Side by each. To tie the old knot. Wouldn't that be great? Let's have Clarence and like I said the other day.

I forget it. I'm talking to a loser. We're going to have Hosec and Succo just on CNN just only moments ago. Test positive for steroids. What a shock. And that surprising? That's not- He's shocked in the state. Wow. I wonder how that putts feels from Pennsylvania. That's been 25-year-long bucks to take him in his girlfriend. And hang out in Jose's house. I wonder if Jose's- Oh, there's more- Sure. Here it is steroids, Royce. Hmm. Poor Jose. He just can't stay out of the way, but you know what I'm saying? Just can't keep his ass out of the way of it. Senate votes to allow drugs from Canada, eh? But- Well, it sounds like good news, but unfortunately we'll see where this goes. Because the Senate voted today just to sure time ago to allow US Farmers to buy prescription drugs in Canada, where the same it is in self or less, and resell them here. Another attempt to drive down the rising, outrageous, unacceptable grotesque cost of drugs in this country. The 62-28 vote attached to the measure pending Medicare prescription drug bill moving through Congress, where approval in the House and Settos expected by the end of next week. Lawmakers, especially those living in state's border in Canada, have been pressing for the change for years, spurred especially by senior citizens in their states who board buses across the border and by cheaper drugs in Canada. But the provision includes a measure that could prevent it from ever becoming law. It requires the Secretary of HHS to help the human services to certify that the re-importation can be done safely. Congress passed a similar law once before, but HHS Secretary of the House, because Donna, excuse me for being at the U.M. Shalala, would not certify that could be done without risk to her patients. Her successor, Tommy Cheesehead Thompson, said the same. That didn't stop the Senate from acting, Senator Byron Dorgon, Democrat of North Dakota, successfully argued that Canada safety controls were just as reliable as those in the US, and US consumers have nothing to fear from drugs, law from Canadian Farmers' services. So what it boils down to, we get as much a repressive anassels, trying to like prevent people from saving money and getting ripped off by the drug companies here. And they gouge you if you save money. That's what I'm just saying. Right. They're trying to prevent you from saving money. And Republicans should all want to do that to them. No, they want you to like, they want you to empty out your pockets and give it all to them and their buddies is what it boils down. Just empty your pockets, empty your bracket and give it to us. Trust us with it. We'll take care of it. Hold it for you. Right. We'll invest it. Yeah. We'll invest it. We'll call off a mid-tourge. Trust somebody with a great track record. 560, 560, pound 560.

And it wasn't covered in the movie, but in the book, they, when the godfather wanted to get Michael Holmes say, fleeing, get him clear to the murder charge. Right. they would get somebody who was terminally ill to confess. I always thought the implication was that this guy had another sort of suicide mission to go kill Rob. And that, you know, they took care of their families and perpetuity. Well, no, that was Frankie Pentangeli, that was his deal. Right. It's got an abat tub it open up his wrists. Right. The his family would be taken care of. Right. Right. And that was, we don't really ever know. I'm saying in other words, you can assume that if you want, but I just got the feeling that why don't you probably write because how the hell was he going to get out of there? Right. Right. That's what I always thought because he just opened his arms up and let him blow him over. Yeah. Name you could be right. I thought he was running. Not too fast though. He was thinking good to the other guy. I think the answer is not fast enough. Thanks a lot, Pally. I have a good summer. You don't just do just fine. Don't worry about him.
