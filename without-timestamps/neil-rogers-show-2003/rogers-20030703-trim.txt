Christian college in Australia has become the latest institution of Banshari Potter books for putting evil wizardry in a good light. Morantha, Christian college near Melbourne, Australia said the books provided wizardry is normal, not a message that students should be of both. This is a college, this is not kindergarten. Not even like middle school or high school, it's a college, a Christian college. Well they don't count. A string of other schools around the world have taken the same step in recent years, principal Bert Langewack said as Christians, which craften he occult are considered evil. Absolutely. It's been widely publicized that many children have tried to cast spells as result of reading the books and that is not a few we want held, don't be holding it. We would deal with same Macbeth and Hanna because evil there is being portrayed as evil and not being portrayed as good. Harry Potter, evil is whatever it is. That's true. Are you as judge recently overturned a band by an Arkansas school district after rejecting arguments that Harry Potter encouraged witchcraft, a pile of Potter books were brought into New Mexico and he's sent it to 2001 by a religious group who claimed Harry was the devil and we know better cause he ain't the devil, it's for Mel's the devil, right? J-U-U. A preacher at least in Maine, marked the Chamber of Secrets release by holding a party in which he shredded copies of Potter books. The books were successfully removed from private schools in the United Arab Emirates because the government said the story was contrary to Islamic values. The latest book Harry Potter in the order of the Phoenix was released to worldwide friends on June 21 and you had sold almost over six million copies by now, but the thumb's speaking right now. You got yours yet? Oh God. They're wrong in that article. About what? The witches in Macbeth are not treated as evil. They're just fortunate. But I'm just telling you what they said, that they're rational for why they don't take Macbeth and Hamlet out of there because there would be two embarrassing, but Harry Potter that's acceptable, I guess. And I'll straighten some Christian church. Polycrath. You know, there's an interesting cause this morning I come in to studio and here already how to off the fancish machine. Teams a hot ticket for a crowd of 30,000, 60, 84. You know, South Florida is the most front running phony place. Almost every place is front running and phony, but not to the grease South Florida is just like most people are free loaders, but not to the grease South Florida be. So it's quoting like, here's Miami's Mark Udy Eras who bought his box seats. Oh, and by the way, we apologize here on QA, I want to be the first to say the clearance owes in a apology. We have the wrong time. This, you know, for all gets everybody whipped up in our friends, you will be have all accredited for the 920 and 920 people who allegedly blocked tickets to walk up and bought him before the game. The second largest walk up in franchise history gives Scott all accredited for that. But when it be nice if we had the game time right on your Marlon station, it would be nice. Have a nice touch. Who cares? I guess those people who showed up there. Few of them were promoting all day. I kept his schedule still front of me here. Marlon's I'm Dex, 630, Marlon's in a brave 705. I'm watching City Pulse, which is like, like I see an N. Headline news, you know, it's one of those busy screens with a million different things on it. And it's 20 to late. 20 to late. And it says in a bottle of the screen at the end of six innings, it's Florida one in the land and nothing. I'm thinking 20 to late and they played six innings. This must be the fastest game in history. It's in Posseblee. And so I come in here and I look on the on the Sun Sentinel website and sure enough it's a 605 game. So Clarets and the people of QA in Europe, Marlon's station want to apologize profusely. If anybody showed up later was confused because we had the wrong game time. Shame on you, Clarets. Well, for brothers trying to get all these people out there and build up the Marlon's and do all of this other waste of time. Well, he's trying to do that and you're given a wrong guy damn game time. This Clarets, you know, since he and a beast are getting it on like on a very regular basis, he hasn't got a lot of money. He's got time to like do his homework. He hasn't got a clue what's going on. We got the Hillary man. We got the Hillary book. We'll do that after the break. We got to results yesterday's pool. My Tyson, they hit him like poison. Can't stand my Tyson. The Spiesom. nauseating stereotype. In fact, I think it's the white guys who primarily. Paper does all those paper view fights that he hit. I think it's mostly white guys. There's most of the dark guys first of all. They ain't got the money to pay for no paper view. Anymore than they got my legal by tickets to a sporting events. So, for Rouse, going to put him on a mat. Yeah, I rest my case. Okay, it's all. I'm tickled with that for him. It's a great responsibility he's taken, but it's on his shoulders. I hope he's getting the cut. That troubled friend. He ought to be getting the cut. He ought to be on the payroll. Right on. For all the work that he's doing, given away all those free tickets and having like sex or he's out there in the outfield. Why not hold that? What's wrong with that? I had a laugh yesterday. I mean, you know, he just says it. He just says crap. And it just, you know, each of those people in those two sections spent a hundred bucks a piece. Stop and figure out nine bucks for parking, okay? Okay. Where do the other 91 bucks go? Let's see. That one did about 15 beers and six hot dogs a piece, right? That's his crowd. Me beers and two hot dogs. Yeah, that 90 bucks. You're right. I forgot about that. Iced on Scott, you're doing it. So he's the man. And then, of course, we're going to look forward to him doing the same thing for the Panthers this year. Is he going to do that? No, not unless they actually start spending some of that money. Now, they were yesterday here on the sports. And that we're saying it. Rick Dudley is a talk and he's going to. He's got money to spend. So let's see if they're just talking through their ass again or they bring some real players in as opposed to the youngsters in the organization. I'll say it again when you put a crappy product out there, people are going to spend the big bucks to come out and see it. Marlins, you don't have to spend big bucks. Take their cheap. But the fact of the matter is, they're still 500. They're still 11 games behind Atlanta and all of this big hoop lie, you know, and it could only be for well, right? So I used Scott, saw you, man. No, it's that. But the team they love the team. No, it is not. It's not on trial a little bit. Who's amazing? But I don't care. Baseball's boring. Wither without Don Trail or Tomorrowland's or Scott. Baseball's boring. It's just no two ways of on it. But the people are so terrified that something exciting is going to happen and they're not going to be on a bad wagon in time. Like back in 97 when a wonderful world serious and a playoff game, some of them they early playoff games had a lot of empty seats, unsold and burasing like in Atlanta. Lot of firm running phony towns. 1013 at 5.60 WQM. According to Martha Fourth did you lie, we hope everybody has a great and safe holiday.

He joined Joe Costello from noon till two today at the Verizon Wireless located at 69-89 West Broward Boulevard, stopped by to spin that prize wheel. And when Marlon tickets too, all, that's noon to two with Joe Costello and Verizon Wireless and Plantation see now somebody actually might take those Marlon tickets. Although they did lose last night, it was 13 innings but they did lose. So that might temper somebody's opinion out there. 288 votes on a pool from yesterday would, oh by the way, should mention. Because they won't be on tomorrow neither of anybody else on this station except the beast and the Carlos will be sitting there playing a bunch of crap. It's July 4 tomorrow. Nobody would have brains working. No. Let's see who's doing the Humber Show tomorrow. I may have to take that back because I think it's a case doing it today at Shulers. No, that's right. We got the Marlon set the fillies. They got another really game 605. Oh, I say the big. Oh, like I said, no real broadcasts will be on tomorrow. Saturday is my other's birthday. Happy birthday, ma. It should be 90 years old Saturday July 5. Are you ready for that? It's just too bad for that. Oh, yeah, she's ready. No, no change. She's still the same. You know what I mean? From 1808 votes on a pull from yesterday, which of these people represents most a ugly sexual racial or ethnic stereotype. My ties in 282 wins hands down your pants. No, even close. Nobody even close. Even though he was the late edition, I must forgot about him. Thanks to me for remembering. You're welcome. Friend, Russia, the nanny. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. It was second with 167. Our family really lead. Ilyana Gross, late in another later edition. 134, a very strong third of the place. Nice going, Eliana. They heat your light poison. You're an obnoxious disgusting stereotypical bitch. See? And not only that, but the Roseanne Rosanna Dan is a spinning intergrave. And she'd milder ain't too happy about it either. Barbara Streisand 96, that cross-eyed bitch, Richard Simmons 69. Rosyodonel 64. She was an edition like right at the end of the show. Right at the ass and. And I said, who could better represent a big fat disgusting obnoxious nasty bull bike than Rosie O'Donnell. And there she is moving all the way up almost covered she Simmons. And as she ever did catch him, she probably beat the snanautum. Jackie Mason had 60. Christopher Lowell 55 and Jim J. Bull are 46. They were asked to ask. Rosie Perez had 34. Rodney King 33. Jerry Seinfeld 32. Too Jewish. Strong thermostat 31. We apologize to that bad spelling. Don King 29. Gloria Stephon 26. Charles Nelson Riley 23. Eddie Murphy 21. Queen Le Thief and I teen. Charles 14. Kuchi Kuchi. Reese V. Abruz V. Lancia 12. Seattle. If you are people know who that queen is. Eddie Griffin 11. There's your nays Lucy. He had only eight. But it's again, it's a period thing. You know what I mean? Lucy was having her period. Does he? Would they know that's true? They weren't. No, they wouldn't even sleep in the same bed. They had separate beds. Couldn't say pregnant. And that's right. Slice the loan seven. Now we did it. We never got a good Guido. He's five long people that look upon him is being a Guido. Just as being a leader. I'm a leader. Right. Absolutely dumb, right? Absolutely. Richard Lewis six ripped Taylor six and poured any ILO head on E3 out of nearly 13. I revoked pretty good considering that nobody in town. Not too bad. We'll do that. Hillary thing in the second. But we should probably take the first call because it's online six and it's in Aventura. Here's a venture. Hello. Aventura. Going once. Oh, and the other ones that we know who the other one is two because it's online nine in my Amelda is short call. Hello. Yeah. There he is. Okay. Here's the Hillary book. Living a history by Hillary. What? Doesn't. No. No. No. No. It's gone to the point now taking the chronic concept to a new level on this radio station. You just see you need to have to see where they're calling from. Allegedly. All you do is see what line they're on. And you're ready to who it is ahead of time. So you prepare your finger and you make for a very short call. And before you know it. We're going. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Three for three. Nice call in here. Oh my on top of it or what? Go home. Let's go home. A little over the top. Oh, you are a little hysterical. You know, he wants to get an extra emphasis on it because you know it's like a the summer schedule starting. This is a day I've been looking forward to for a very, very long time. I didn't realize that for all was so easy to. Oh, you got to do his press a little button here, a little button there. And he just flip some. Very sense of its part of that active puts on very sensitive guy. Anyway, Hillary says, my mother stayed in California for 10 years never seeing her mother and really seeing her father. Her grandfather Edwin Seenie reformer British sailor left the girls to his wife Emma, a severe woman who were black Victorian dresses and resented and ignored my mother's, my mother except for enforcing her rigid house rules. Emma discouraged visitors and really allowed my mother to attend parties or other functions. One Halloween when she caught my mother trick or treating with school friends, Emma decided to confine her to her room for an entire year except for the hour she was in school. She forbade my mother to eat at the kitchen table or linger in the front yard. This cool punishment went on for months until Emma sister, Belle and recent, came for a visit and put it to a stop. How do you like that? And that's what we're doing right now putting it to a stop. That's a whole paragraph. And now we're already on page three in Hillary's book. Let's hear it. You're a great and cruel man. We're making some real progress. It's a great kind thing because this way number one it saves people 28 bucks and number two they hear it. Only little tiny doses, which is all anybody including Bubba could take of Hillary. Little tiny dose. 560560 pound, 560 of me 80 and T. That's probably how many times they did it. Those. That wouldn't surprise me. After she popped out the Chelsea that was the end of that. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Yes sir. You're a smart spotting. Okay. Thanks a lot, Palo. You're sucking you blow. Okay. Thank you. See I'm telling you they're definitely going to get it in today because they know. I mean I will be on Tuesdays and Thursdays in July and August. So it's not like I'm disappearing all together. Although mentally it'll feel like I am, you know. Like a cameo appearance here and there. Get it in today, baby. Get it all out of your system. You're sucking you blow. Thanks very much for listening by the way. We're legislating every day between 10 and 2. I thank you for profusely. 560560. You think in fact, before we even start to pull me we can get like about 100 of those in a row, you know. It's kind of a parting shot for my good close personal friends in South Florida. We love you, Neil. It was suck. You blow. Yeah. You got a wooden. Exactly. So well as he's saying this morning. Don't drink and drive. Firework boy. There you go. That's what he was saying. He's a good one to be talking about that. Yes. Yeah, he ought to be doing the Dwayne's stop PSA for real. Don't drink and drive. It's bad. It's dangerous. Here's a call from now. Why are there like these little. I never asked being a boy. Why he does that. Why do you put those little stars on there? If I have a feeling that there are cranks. But you're never right. You're never right. Occasionally. I beg the differ sometimes. Well, once they're very wild. Yeah. Yeah. I do a lot better just by looking at which line it comes in on using the force. It is a may. I had the force within me within my. Blackthumb because some of these people have got their own private line now. Because it's doing that was here. They did become such an integral part of the show. It's important that we get them on to the head of their own direct line to get on. Here's a call from candle with four stars. Hello. Four stars. Do I have to tell you how you doing? Pretty good. Yeah. Good. And I just got one of my mom's promotion. That's going to be going on. Which is getting some chocolate. Covered yellows in a free bottle of dragon motion. Now you're talking. Yes, sir. Open the upper deck. Maybe 50. Yeah. Okay. Oh, man. You turned. I love it. I'm telling you we're going to have a wonderful time here today. You exactly hate you. We wish you a die. Well, not before. Yeah. Not before they die because then it would have nothing to listen to. Here's the poll for today. We're going to be really Godfather intensive. I don't know that there's that many for them to add. You know, I mean, there are, but not that we get any votes. What's let me get them. Then you get the music cranked up here. Okay. So we have the proper accompaniment for this. Here we go. Who is your favorite character from the three Godfather movies? Godfather? Godfather, part 2 and Godfather, part 3. You know what I didn't say, Godfather, part 1 today. I sold on factors again. Here's the list I have so far. Don Cullionny. Centino, Sonny. They shot Sonny in a cause. Who's dead? Michael. Clomenza. Fat Clemenza. Tesio. Tom Hagen. I never saw the Godfather. I stuck that in the middle there, but. Well, no, I didn't want to forget to put it on there. Never saw the Godfather. We can't play any of those I'm sure. Sophia. What a big schnaz. Connie. A sterical Connie. Tadio Cher, keep it all in the family. But at least she was good, you know. She was great. Frado. Frankie Pantangely. I was still sitting in the bathtub, by the way, it's about time somebody cleaned the mountain. Salud. Salud. Salud. What was the vampire teeth? I loved Salud so he was there. His name actually was Virgil. Salud. So I don't think we need the first name. Captain McClusky, Sterling Hayden, great actor. He's dead. Oh, he was a good actor. Yeah. Try the wheel. It's the best in the city. Kettle McClus. A little hard going down. Talk about the last supper. Vincent. Real good. Vincent would have been a good Guido. Oh yeah. Nuri. Simon Ross. Mo Green. Look at. I don't have time for all of these things. We've got, you know, we got plenty of time here today. We'll drop them all in. You know who I am. I'm Mo Green. I made my phone when you were going out with cheerleaders. Look at Brotsie. Don't call you. And Jack Walsh. One of your very favorites. Now I like them too. He was here. He was a pit. I don't get how many. I don't get any. What? Great ball. Come out on the one one. Amen. We don't see. Amen. No band leader. That's right. Yeah. Great. That's right. Yeah. Great. So there you go. That's our list. Your favorite character from the three godfather. What was including I never saw godfather for those of you. People who just, I feel so bad for those people. You know what? They think they were live and somewhere to something like missing in their life. Now over the holiday weekend. Those of you who are like shut ins or maybe it's going to rain like cats and dogs. They lately. Really. That's what happened yesterday is going to find coming in and all of the stuff will be into the world. So this weekend, if that happens, maybe I don't want to have it support your 4th July picnics and stuff. But if that should happen, there's a good idea. Get the trilogy on DVD. You know, if your cheap skate, you only have a VHS, VCR or just get the biology. Yeah, we're getting the biology. And stick them in there. Because before they stick your action around, you want to see the godfather. Okay, I'm going to talk about movies if you haven't seen the godfather. Exactly. I'd be like talking about movies without seeing the, what? Last week I'm Homer Sunset. My local, we're sports video 560's you and you. Yeah. Everyone to complain to this station. First, Marlon Grando was the godfather. Then I'll put you know, was godfather 2 and 3. No, get ready for the ultimate godfather. Godfather 4. Godfather, you must help for me. Leave the guns of that coming in the bund of my house. And then I have to my family. Maybe you could order a hit or something. Hey, jump right here. I'll take my hits. Come and see the band. Make it feel good. You get up like a ses machine. Get them gotta give it up. Turn it loose. Get up and get foot. Make them ready to go sweat. Come see us. Please. Please. Oh. Godfather, pardon me. But you just said don't look like any of the other conlionists. Put the unibabby on a macaroni. I think I'll be knitted if. I have a soul food. Put my chin and please. Let it make it break out of the clothes. Go fall on. Oh. The godfather 4 is starring James Brown. The godfather soul. He'll make you know for you can't understand. Absolutely. 1034-560 WDK. The new pole is up and the as expected. Don Corlioni is leading. See if is the definitive line from the whole trilogy is. I want to make him a Alfred. Right. Is there any debate about that? Right. That's the defining line of the whole godfather trilogy. Yeah. That's son. He was such a pit. No. I'm not. I did vote for Don Corlioni because without him even though he wasn't in part two or three, the word Marlon Brando. His younger character with the Nero was in it. But I mean Marlon Brando was only in the first one. But in spite of that, without him, there would have been no godfather. See what I'm saying? Right. Con Corlioni is got five. Michael has got two. Clemens is one. And one who never saw the godfather in the early returns. Okay. Let me say it again. All this talk about movies last couple months. If you haven't seen the godfather, you haven't started. There's no point even worrying about any of these other ones. Like bedspotter and the train spot and toilet spot. Forget about that. It's the yardstick. It's the yardstick of life. I want to make him an off-regain. Exactly. No, that's seriously. That's it. That's it. I was at Carroll City because you wrote Croll City on it. Which I don't think there's a Croll City. Is it? Yeah. Carroll City, probably. Here's Carroll City or something. Hello. You forgot him and him and him and him. I was in. From yesterday. Crona. Come again. How many times he got a call today? About third man. Just relax. Pally. We're not going anywhere. George will be on Monday. I'll be on Tuesday. I'll be on Thursday. Thursday Saturday. You know, the way it goes. Like, I'll only would say this relax. Put it back in your pants. You're a crazy person. I'll put all the up till these last couple of days. We ever discover just absolutely how crazy this guy is. How come we'd more and I know him before? Oh, they're just all crazy. They're just lump them all in together. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. It's me for real. Yeah. But subscribe. I'll breakfast for two over at my favorite place. How about breakfast and Tiffany Scott? Yeah. That's all. I'll bring Andre Hepburn. You bring 34 C. Okay. Ha ha. He's the talk of the town. Make no mistake about that. Outside the station, they're talking about him inside. And of course, inside some of our desperate meetings. They're probably talking about him too. But you know, how nervous our management could. Yeah. Just a bunch of penny waste. Yeah. Yeah. Of course, you know, who's sitting at home right now speaking of what you just played. Absolutely. Crap it in his pants, which is not unusual. Why when he keeps reaching around in there, you know, has a tendency to loosen everything up. Not a good idea. No, he seriously. I told him when he first came. He need to loosen up a little bit. I think he misunderstood. He didn't catch my drift right. You know, he wasn't talking. I wasn't. Ha ha. Maybe he's seeping. But at any rate, he's sitting at home. And what do we have that thing? You probably forgot to put that in there. I'm listening. Actually, I put it into a mini disc. And now what? What is that? Why did you do that? Oops. I put it after a mini disc. And then he lost the mini disc. And he lost the mini disc. Oh, you might even bother, you know. My father. Was there he thought that he'd disc? And what's he going to do with it? Stick it up his ass. I don't know. He should be putting his gun on the plate on the air. But yeah, he does. But anyway, Moe's a homeless and that's the point. He's he was sitting there. He is. Absolutely. And the getting the drift that for well is getting hotter than a goddamn hell. And as we zoned that, there was a crossover this morning. Yesterday we didn't have one this morning. It was a fairly lengthy crossover with guilty and for well. It sounded pretty good. It sounded like those two were starting to bond. If you ask me. Oh, yeah. So if I was sitting at home right now, picking my ass, I'd be getting really, really nervous. In fact, I probably have one finger in my left nostril and one between my cheek. Right now. Getting real nervous about what's going to be happening. I don't know what to wait and for you know, isn't just it don't you agree with me. It just a matter of time before for well as on 6 to 10. Right. I mean, Moe 5 to 6, you know, an hour did drive to work an hour on here and an hour did drive home. That's three hours as well. It's not a matter of this. It's a matter of when. As Bob Green would say, Here's a call from Orlando. It says hello. How you doing now? Pretty good. How are you? Pretty good. I'm actually very happy to finally get to talk to you guys. I'm usually at work, but today I'm off. I'm going to give you a call. Good friend of yours up in Orlando. We'd like you to say hi to a for us. I hear. Yeah. Hi. Those are the best. They are. But I want to say that I love your show. I like George. I don't know what everybody gets on this case about. Actually, my George was on on sick on Tuesday. I invited people to call in and rip him and ask because they knew he was sick and out listening. We only had two or three. No, we only had two or three and everybody else was full of crap. So they didn't rip him and ask. They didn't want to say you show us great and I have to listen over the internet. But I still enjoyed every day. You make my work day. Good. And if it all possible, could you play the like recleam for a dream? Oh, I love that. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's amazing. You got a mind. Thank you. Have a great day. Good holiday. Bye. Well, there was a real call. Of course, it took somebody from Orlando to call in, but you wouldn't expect one from like Dayton Broward. That would be a little bit carried away. What? What? Normal person. I'm not saying this last guy was like a normal person, but everything being relative. He was a pretty damn good. Twenty to eleven at five. Fifty. What's the schedule look like today? We got the mad dog down there again. Another toughest time that he's in key west at Chulas. Then we'll show from two to four. Then we got Eddie K at Chulas in town. And my name is Lake's four to seven because Hank is another really brutal assignment. Hank's on a way to Vegas. I hope you're doing some shows next week, one or two or whatever. Then you got Chulas in March, seven and ten tonight. How did you like that? As we start moving into our July fourth, our holiday mode as Chulas in Markaron when somebody is actually awake seven and ten tonight. The big tended to it any slot. Any S.P.N. radio overnight if you can handle it. My life and love. This is Fort Real by sixty. Way and way. Well, I mean, can I use something my crowd next friend? I wore much better pants when my career was alive. You got to get out and want milk. You're not going to wait in here. Hey, you want something to eat? When you got. Uh, nothing. But I can pull something out of my ass. Namo. I got it when going. I'm starting a new business. Very no good. Yeah, I'm going to be a hooker. I'm proud of my mum. Thanks. No, yeah. You sure you're awesome, me, huh? Oh, I see. Tell you. Hey, what are you trying to do, C. Oh, no, I don't know what you're talking about. You just took a piss to a sweet little pill. Never scripted him more or less. I got him from my deductor. What's that? Doctor. What's that, Toyan? Who looked my parents, who opened his queue. My god, this place is a mess. And my underwear smells like hot ballori. I've got to hear my favorite show is on. We got a loser. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Move, move, move, move. Move, going in this front press, dig it. Broke it right out, flat it. Yeah! Oh, me, buddy. I just like to see. That's a lovely dress you got on there, y'all. Hello, ma'all. Thank you. I am such a pretty mother. I feel like one of the toughest three. I just look, look, look. I'm an ancient man. You want to make me cow hatch. So, I'm like, who, look, you want to win this? I like to turn in. I don't break my highly desirable ass. I actually want to win this game. You want to win this game? You want to win this game? You want to win this game? Can't I ever break my eldest? Can you make me another ancient man? Take a look at this ear. Get in, ma'all. Hey, buddy. Hey, hey, drop me. Oh, I was on radio, y'all. I was on radio. Just so kind of told that you won't see anything. Broke it right. The boy, the boy, the boy, the boy. I was on radio. Oh, boy. The boy, the boy. The boy. I was on radio. Broke it right. The boy, the boy. Well, hello. Up and I decided to stop by. You see how you were doing. Oh, that guy died. Oh, this is terrible. It's 1046 and 560 WKM. He is absolutely the best. You know what that mall? Make no mistake about it. The right nothing like mo. Nope. So the second most important line in the godfather, all three movies is. The god. Take the canoli. What do you have? But apparently the cutest line. I'm very serious about that. Let me stay again. He's a good. Take the canoli. See, he had his priorities straightened up. Right. Plus he knew that if they took an African-olice, Connie would save seven and four later on for Eli Wallach and got father three. It might have been a little bit stale by then, but not what they have. 560, 505, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. We're giving away tickets for tonight's Marlins game. Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Are you talking about the godfather? Oh, but the useless guinea's to have no circumstances. Oh, it's Reverend Jo. Oh, yeah. Like I said, that's what is that for now? Fort Criter, not even another clock yet. We've had four of our most famous chronics. You know, I'm see I've been doing this countdown for today. And every once in a while in a moment of giving this. I'm starting to think about the countdown, the final countdown. You know what I mean for like, oh, end of this, the end of the contract, the end of the career, the end of the end of this thing. Oh, I can't even begin to tell you how giddy I'm going to be. Oh, Neil, what would you do without the outlet at the radio show to be? It's a little bit too cool. Probably live in extra 15 years. Here's a call from Naples, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. I'm from Naples. Is that what we said? That's why I just said Naples has a Naples Florida, I'm assuming. Yeah, I got cut off. I got a question for you. Actually, in the Miami area right now, and I do listen to your program over here, and I do get it in Naples at times, five, six, you'll come in. Do you guys have a facial over there like Naples are for Myers at? No, we used to, but they are cut off off because they're too busy putting a bunch of religious crap on. A little bit too left wing for the West Coast of Florida. Yeah, this is a little bit. Okay, what is your, I guess I can listen to it over an internet when I'm in Naples? There you go. You got it. And what's your internet address? On theorangers.com, any ILROGERS, no Dino A, NeilRangers.com. Because I tried to go on it, no Dino, I couldn't get advantage. I enjoy listening to your program. Excellent. All right, well, Wilson, thank you. And that's a good for you. And you too, thanks a lot. Thank you. See the good people today from Orlando and Naples. I've told you for years, there's nothing wrong with South Florida that wouldn't be cured by a people transplant. Absolutely. That's the problem. I mean, we got a small percentage of people that are really pretty good. Not third man. And the other 70% I wouldn't wish on April Brown, Jr. I mean, on anybody. Oh, that's the problem. Got the nice beaches. Beautiful climates for about what? Two weeks a year. Maybe month. Maybe about a month, like in January, once in a while. Oh, seriously, it's just a fine place, except for the fact that they got the wrong people there. A lot of assholes and self-floor. I want to every street corner. There's another major, major asshole. Every phone line. You just said, look at this. He's got the only a couple actually. See your slip and being a bride here and here, there's more cranks on it than just two. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. In regards to the guy's father, I'm going to say, you know, what do you think about what I said of it? What do I think about pulling a Santa? What do you mean what do I think about it? I think he's a week week sister. You don't think so. He's weak. Wake. Just like your phone line, weak. What the hell was that all about? Hola. Hello. Oh, for just a second there, I thought we lost a line. Was his phone line, right? It was his phone line. Well, he need a hug out there. He was a he was weak. Was he weak? The thing you put it brings a lobby and I sign, leaks. Yeah, what do I think about pulling a Sarah? Be my friend. I don't have that. God, follow. And the third most important line that I already played. I don't get how many take, I'll get you off, please. Come back a lot on the one point. That's Jack Walshman. He had away with words. He had a lot of good lines. I know, band leader. I heard that story. The hard heart had set of a bitch, whatever he says. And don't forget. We must go to the Courier. Speaking of Bonaceta. Suspended to sentence. This scum. They not. But she kept the honor. And anyway, here's a call from the coconut Greek, hello. Yes, sir. What about, what about his Maryland? Is this like he's leaks with the fish? He's leaks with the fish, yeah. We love the goda. That was a good one now. In fact, when he said he sleeps with the fish, they thought they was talking about Tesio because they knew he'd be going to be playing with the fish. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. He was going to be a good one. There you go. That's right. Because that seems to be happening more and more on our station now. You notice that Hank is working about two hours a day. Once a day, once a day, while when he shows up. I like that. That's my motto. Now, let's work more pain. That's what we're doing. Beautiful thing. And then closing. No, no, no. That's what he said to the homo. No, no. That's what the parents told the beast. No, that's not. No, no, no. He did. He's getting really. He's really. 560? 560. 560? On the AT&T. Right. Why do you know when you're out of practice for that long? You have to like ease into it. Oh. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Marley Cole? Oh. Very nice. So reading though today. Very quiet. Very low key. Kind of a fourth of July. Very patriotic. Marty told. line nine, which is always the same person. Here's Miami Lakes. Hello. He's always got his thumb right on it. 5605060 on the AT&T and keep one thing in mind. Don't drink and drive. Firework boy. There you go. Keep in mind. Don Corlion A 22 votes, Migueli, Michael's got 19. Never saw the Godfather 11. That just tears my guts up. Santino, sunny. Santino's got 11 votes. There's nothing wrong with sunny. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Santino looks a little like a piece of Swiss cheese. Come in to 7. Look at what I see. We missedpelled a lot of these names badly. We apologize. 6. Frankie Pintangeli 5. Tom Hagen 4. Mo Green Head 4. Hey, Mo, what do you see? What do you know? Jack Waltz 3, highman Rothhead 3. Sofia 1. That's that kid that likes her nose. He's got the hotst for her nose. He'd like to sit on it. 3.01. So let's go one. And none for Niri or now what is that? Tessio, not Ressio. Tessio. But Jesus. Now is that you've been a boy? Is that Eric again? That's Eric. He's never seen the Godfather. No, Tessio with a T, not where. He's never seen the Godfather. I knew there was something desperately wrong with his emotional development. The man has never seen the Godfather. You're Ressio. That is so freaking embarrassing. Hey, Eric. You're gonna talk about it. Anyway, Ressio don't have any votes. He had neither this Connie or McCluskey or Vincent. How to bomb her date votes are good for Andy Garcia. Who still stand out there in front of where Alianeito used to hang out. He's still standing there in front of the house. That was so embarrassing. It was so humiliating. I mean, we've seen Shane was pandering, especially if you read the Herald every day. But that had to be the ultimate. Between Gloria Estefan and Andy Garcia, Prancing around out there in front of the house. Was there anybody else I'm leaving out? I thought I could take up. See, he said there. Besides Rich Sanchez, who of course is busy making Frank at calls to that cell phone. Oh, don't go to sister jeans house. Turn around and come back. They changed their mind. He didn't. He damn near. I think that he couldn't get you on that cell phone. He damn near interfered with American history right there. This is a little squatting turd burger who's good buddies with Kester no balls now. Rich, that says. You know, like a bad penny, he just keeps turning up again. He will not go away. He's like, what's your name on Channel 4 and Jalore. The silly goose. And also like, what's your name? Me, shell, Gillan. The bad pennies, they just keep coming back over. Just when you think you get him out of town in their long gone. Mr. Ego, same thing. He was in the earth for how many minutes. Not a half an hour cup of coffee. He came back. They kicked his ass out. Same with Angela Ray, the same with all these other losers. Now Rich Sanchez comes back and he's a sucking up with all the other losers. Hey, why do I cast your nobody? I just talked to Duff this morning. He says we still don't want to hire you. Here's a call from Miramar, hello. Same crazy. Yeah, we know. We know. We already marked it down. Here's heaven, sure. Hello. Mr. Rogers, how are you? Pretty good. Sir, how are you? I'm hanging in. Hey, listen to your show probably 20 years. My dad caught me hooked on you. Oh, right. Ever since then, you've been on the dial. Hey, Walter got to be the best character because of his quick wit when Tom Hagen tells him I'm not Italian. I'm Irish German. He goes, well, my Nick Crow friend. It would be with the, uh, the slurs. Well, I mean, I was talking to my brother. My friend. Well, I mean, I'm talking to my Crow. Nick, friend. Well, I mean, tell you something. My Crow, Nick, friend. Exactly. That's it. Adam and Sarah, you're the best. Hi, Sally. How are you? How are you? You two are thanks. Have a great fourth. Did you lie, sir? And whatever you do, I'm not going to get this. I'm trying to queue it up again real fast. You're on the, it's hard to do on a, on a cassette machine. Don't drink and drive firework, boy. There you go. Little advice from our good, the Mr. Marlin, the Marlin man. Put that damn Billy the Marlin to shame. I think you ought to be the team mascot. Don't you? Okay. Well, I guarantee I can see him running around the stands. You're all the same. It was me great. Actually, might be a little bit of fun out there for a change. I'll just do the, not that I'm going to hurry to get through the show today, but I just do that damn, uh, page your way. My life and low, this is for three or five, sixty. You're way too way, yeah. Get taken a spare, of course. Talk about loose vocal. Wow. One is the total standards at a Marlin's game. Three, four, eight to two, no one. That's the total standards at a Marlin's flat day. Two, might wait to see your home run. Back to Marlin's game. You might see the only one to get a stroke from the sun. Watching all of the dark day. You'll be there for a love and have yourself to hopefully hear. So, we'll go for a walk and have a nice talk with the guy over there. For a small piece of jewelry, ten-ditch, one, two-ditch, I'll let him in. All the kids are marlin's kids, they just stay always with him. All the boys are the families who have his children and their parents. All the boys are marlin's kids, they just stay always with him. All the girls don't have their own. Absolutely. Now, you know what inspired me to play that, don't you? I'm sure that that's the fashion, fracy and candle. Nice, gone, fracy. It was a great perspiration. And I just love Amy Man. Are you sure positive? Not as much as Brad the Barton you're going to close the camera. Anyway, she says more movie talk. I agree with you, Tracy. She likes it. She says I watched about half hour of Magnolia last night. Started at nine, could make a true, so I taped it a watch the rest of the night. It's a long movie, folks. It's over three hours. It'll be on independent film channel over the weekend for those who haven't seen it yet. Once again, you are absolutely correct about Magnolia's greatest. Yes, I am Tracey. I'm totally hooked, me too. No matter how absurd it got, I just can't stay away. But actually, redeem Tom Cruise and Julian Moore's actors. She is, well, she, I don't know, I never seen anything bad. But at any rate, she was so great. Yes, she was. Potty Motho, clean up your act. You're right. And when it makes me see Jason Rulbars, isn't he? Roe Parkridge, you'll die and guide that to him. I also want some. Yeah. The only downside is that I'm anticipating an anti-climactic frog raining ending that you and George talked about. Thanks for another classic recommendation. Happy summer schedule. Thanks, Tracey. Well, actually, it's not that not the end of the day. That's not the end of the day. The frog thing isn't the end of the movie number one or number two. Even though you know what's coming, because I've watched it three times now. And even though you know that this scene is coming, it doesn't make any difference. No, the frog part is climactic. That's good part. Yeah. Especially for a what's his name, Jimmy. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. Shot the TV screen, right through it. A little TV too. I guess it was like one of those if you have a kitchen. Dammit. I must have met something. Shot that damn thing right through the screen. He was on a rainy. Magnolia isn't there. That's something symbolic there. I would guess. Like maybe that was like the end of his TV career or whatever. But anyway, she's right. Magnolia is sensational. And I know you want to go bitch about the end. But if you go down each and everybody. I don't want to go down. I can't. Now the godfather. I know that she mentions Magnolia because there's a good parallel here. And you know something this is even better. Although there are three different godfathers. There's only one Magnolia. But if you if you just take the original godfather. Part one. If you took the first one. One. You know what I'm talking about. I want to be sweet. Also. I mean, if you go to godfather three, you can pick out your jammel. And this performance was embarrassing. You like Walak who's performance was grow. Test maybe the worst in history. So fear, which the less the said the better. You know. But in in Magnolia, everybody who was in it. Everybody. I mean, everybody rule from what's his name to play the the caretaker there. What is his name Paul Stephen Jones? Whatever his name is. Right. And the and the cop and the daughter. Jimmy. Gators daughter. The little kid. The little kid. The with the quiz kid. Stanley. Which is Stanley. Uh, would you make macy the does donny the quiz kid? He's always good and can we can we give him right everybody. Everybody who was in it Tom Cruise where the lucky man. Not he was great. You like Willie Mace. Macy and Fargo. Yeah, I can't find it. It's not I keep looking for it. But the the Bina's empty. But I'll get it. So thanks anyway, Tracy. A bug on us. See this facts is what about the forgotten test. You know, well, we didn't forget him. It's just that the area is living a sheltered life in Orlando. And he had recio on your okay. And he changed the tates. He only liked that no votes. Now that would surely be one of the top 10 moments or lines in all the three movies. Can you give me off the whole time? Pro time say. It looks a Robert Duel who shakes his hand to a celly and he nods to the guys to take him away and about a big. Yeah, tates. Let's see him number. Yeah, can you give me off the hook Tom for all the time to say. And he says it like so soon. You know, like only able to go to could do it. Because there's hook and forget line in your dancing on the speed. And that was a great scene. Little girl. She's got her little feet on top of issues or the cold vertebrain is the trail, which I just gave. Can't do it, Sally. Tom Higgum. The ruthless Tom Higgum. Maybe I can help. Here's one. You're out. Tom. Maybe you need to have separate categories. It says for Don Cologne. Marlon Brando or Robert D'Niro. It says they both will ask us for their portrayals. And also it says F.O. Well, says F.U. See? That's not it. What about K? Oh, we won't put her on there. Yeah. Is it true Michael? Is it true? You know, I was trying to think of the ending of Godfather, the part one. Oops. And of course, it's the thing where, no, she goes through that thing about is a true and did you have Carl Kildo yetto? Because Connie, she's hysterical. Has derical. And don't ask me about my business. And he's slamming onto the end desk. Just this one time, I'll let you ask me about them. Is it true? No. No. No. He hit. No. No. No. And she looks at him like she may be almost believes him and she goes back in a kitchen. And now she's got the door halfway open. And she sees fat Clemens is there with a guy, the bodyguard, couple of the other Aguitos. And her kissing his ring. Because now of course he's the new Godfather. And the door closes. One of them come over. I think it was nearie. Mm. Comes over and closes the door in case face in a screen goes black. And that's he. Oh, that was such a great scene, you know. Yeah. Well, they all were great scenes. Everyone. All this time. I look at his 19 people that's almost 12% of the audience haven't seen any of the Godfather's yet. Shame on you. Okay. Get with it. I'm telling you, you'll never ever regret it. Every moment will be a moment will spend better spent than go to some stupid ass Marlin Game plus the round the road for three weeks. Now anyway, any all star breaks. So you can't be used. That is an excuse. All right. Kill someone as dead time and soft load. I can't think of anything better than you. You get a great movie. Stick it on your DVD play or whatever you were on stick it. That might be good too. Don Coyoni, what's your favorite character from the three Godfather movies. Don Coyoni 38. Michael 34 type battle there. And of course since Michael was in all three, he has the edge. He has a leg up. I'm Marlin Brand. Ha ha ha. Lift that leg a little higher there. I'll never saw the Godfather. Twenty 11.6%. I feel so I'm well, maybe I feel good because maybe we can talk some of them into it. Santino, sonny's got 19 votes. Nothing wrong with Sonny that if you a little plump a plaster wouldn't help. Look at Brotsie 15. Clemenza. Oh, look at how he's got that spell. He's got two ends. Clemenza. Fact Clemenza's got 12. Get him straightened out there. Were you being a boy? Get it embarrassing to us. We're supposed to be the Godfather experts. These are Clemenza. Eric, you're retarded man. You really are Tom Hagen 10. Can't do it, Charlie. Simon Roth 5. The scene in Godfather 2. Were there having the Senate hearings on Amafia? And of course then Frankie Pentangeli looks back and sees his brother that they just brought in. Nice. Nice cap. Nice head gear. And all of a sudden he decides to change his tune. I didn't know, Godfather. Any goes to that whole thing. Oh, yeah, I better not call it only this. That's the answer. Whatever you say. And then all of a sudden they're like all been out of shape and all the senators are like rustling their papers around. Well, we have sworn testimony on the guy with a mustache. And Tom Hagen screaming, you all like, kind of the apology senator. I want to use it. But nobody's paying attention to what he's screaming. That was a good scene. Yeah. Time to Roth 5. Frankie Pentangeli 5. It was between the brothers. Mo Green 5. Jack Walts 3. Fred was only got a pair of proof. Fred, we can't get no respect. A closky's got one. So Fia's got one from that kid. Once the sugar knows under his armpit. So lots of one and no votes for Niri Tessio. Portesio and have any Connie's got none. And Vincent's got none. I wouldn't dare put you like Walica near Don. What do we figure out was Don? I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. Is that it? No. Yeah, I've looked it up. You weren't paying any attention this morning as usual. Before the show, I looked it up. Don't. I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. I'm not. I think you were doing it right near sea. Okay. You're just a little under the weather. Maybe by Monday. Maybe when does the show on Monday? How are you doing the show Monday or for real? Who knows? I'll just show up and when they come. I'm just going to go. The words are going to be doing the show on Monday. Scott's great. We love Scott for real. He's the wildest thing to come to town in a long time. But you don't want to like dilute it. You don't want to spread them out too thin. You know, that whole idea went and out and spread it up. See, Greg is so, and in fact, we did so obsessed with for real. In fact, Clarence is even more obsessed. He would try to mount him before the show this morning. That's what Scott told me. Stuff them and mount him. He was try to stuff him and mount him and put him on a wall. Tinnom to the wall. But you don't want to do a spread of good thing too far. You know, like we do tend to do. In fact, I'm thinking like 10 to noon sounds really good to me. Everybody, like Hank, he's showing us like convincing a little bit. Mad dog does only a couple of hours. Mow their squeezing down his real tight. There's squeezing it. Here's for a lot of day. Hello. Hey, Neil. Hi, don't. What's your happy 4th of July? Yes, sir. You too. Love the show.

No, the fat Klamemza not the skinny, a little pucky young one, who's a little little, he was a car fool. I think there were smoke and submen that car. This is an interesting story here. Oklahoma City in Oklahoma, man arrested on suspicion of beating his wife, faced year in prison and a fine. But when he's spit in arresting officers face, he got a life sentence instead of official said, yes, they would not have to spend it a sentence either. John Carl Marquez, 36, a beater, no doubt, was convicted of placing bodily fluid upon a government employee, a felony that can get well, what about it? I can carry a life sentence because of the possibility of transmitting a potentially deadly disease. What about when Moe is out there picking the dingo berries out of his coma? Only if he flicks them. I'm on the air city to get for that. I'm turning man. State judge April Seller's white sentence Marquez this week, even though Marquez may obviously are tested negative for any communicable disease, Marquez was also convicted of assaulting a police officer in a jury recommended the maximum sentence because he had previous convictions. He spit in his pussy and he's going to the Sahelbe spit on anybody else on the outside. Anyway, also this story, I think Bina Boy ought to be alerted to this.

You think this is for real or is this the... Who knows? You never know. It could be the hackers like spreading a terrible... This week you've been such a vault of information. It's been... That's beyond description. The government and private technology experts warned today that hackers planned to attack thousands of websites someday and elucially coordinated contest that could disrupt internet traffic. Oh great. A bunch of punks would not have to do, right? Right. And early warning network for the technology industry operating with the Department of Homeland Security notify companies that received credible information about the planet text and already detected surveillance probes by hackers looking for weaknesses in corporate and government networks. We emphasize that all websites of administrators should ensure that their sites are not vulnerable wrote Peter Aller of internet security systems in the Atlanta-based company that runs the Information Technology Information Sharing and Amalization Center. Separately, the New York Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Coordination warned internet providers and other organizations that the goal of the hackers is to to analyze 6,000 websites in six hours. New York officials urge companies to change the full computer passwords, begin monitoring website activities more aggressively. We move on as a very functions from server computers and apply the latest software repairs from vendors such as Microsoft Corp. I'm sure we're doing all those things. Oh yeah. Right now.

Just as you've got a call about the guy that pointed out when Tom Hagen said to Michael that he was more, but he was like a brother, he considered himself a brother. Right. You know, remember that thing? Not helping if I got afraid of so much. Frater was a playing with the fool deck. He was shot a few slices of a loaf. Everybody knew what he was like. He was a fever. Yeah. He was like, he was like, he was explaining. He was like, moving in. Peanut would night. Mm-hmm. And also in that scene where Tom Hagen says, sorry, I can't do a styling. Yeah, so to me, what makes that scene? Not only does he say that, but he makes you take that step back with you. He makes that step back with his own over for a tattoo. He was gone. And he nods. He gives that little guy a wig. I'm winking at a nod. with the eyes. Right. He was so dealin, maybe. Robert Duvall is so great man. He's so great. Great actor. One great we got out there. Listen up.

I certainly about a pound short of the continent and the cheeks. Man. Of course now he don't need no cotton and his cheeks. He's like probably got fat inside of his mouth.

It's 1133-560WQA and here's an amazing story from Boko, I guess we shouldn't be surprised. Everything and soft photos like real, staugy and crusty. Anyway, a new kind of crispy cream shop is coming this way to Boko. It says, but it might not be as easy to be first in line for those tasty pastries. It'll be the franchises first without the trademark neon sign telling customers when fresh donuts emerge. The 60-60-year-old company was forced to forgo with neon sign and Difference to a longstanding city-long bokeh that prohibits expose neon signs. Instead, crispy cream is designing its first non- neon illuminated sign to let up for the donuts are rolled out. This one will be different crispy cream spokeswoman Anne Urban said, as far as where we can't discover any other hot lights that are not neon. The city's decades-old sign code requires commercial signs to be approved by the community alliance board well known for its best steadiness. In fact, Mo had a good special permit for that piece for the muskrad. The city's only McDonald's when I put out its trademark golden arches because they were regarded as improper signs, crispy cream officials expect to start building this fault without the neon sign. Oh, how sad! How sad, which is more repressive. In fact, there's three of them crossbrings, coral gables, and the bokeh. Right. Repressive, no ducks, no trucks, no signs, no neon, no no neighbor, who has a pickle truck and plain flight. But if you're across the old fart, I guess that's why I fell down a dump bokeh for this week and went down a South Beach. How do you like that? He's getting all the freebies at the fountain blue. He's got connections there, man. Yeah. I've returned to the story about the top floor at a fountain blue without used to be. Many years ago. So you didn't, I never told that. I'm sure I must have told it on the air. That's a deep club you moron. Yeah, the top floor of the fountain blue was for very, very high rollers, multi-millionaires and billionaires. They just have like meal, well, like hustlers, a funny, a top floor. That's a long time ago though. I'm going to mention that very emphatically. Although Scott said he would be looking at a man form. I think he likes anything, huh? I think he, because this morning he was talking about his real fantasy is to hump Harrison Ford. You heard it? I did? Or maybe Beenerborger? Were you in there when he was babbling about that? I don't think so. I think about everybody. And Duffkin, Duffkin, a test dude. He was in your witness. In fact, he said, I'll fight you for it. A guest evangelist was preaching at the first Baptist church in the small town of Forest O'Hio. That's in hard on county. Am I reading that right? Yeah. Emphasizing penance and asking for a sign from God. The evangelist was preaching asking for a sign from God. At that moment, the church's steeple was hit by lightning, sitting in the church on fire and blowing out the sound system. It was awesome. Just awesome. So church member Rona Cheney, 40 of rural forest. You could hear the storm building outside. The evangelist just kept asking God, what else he needed to say? It was asking for a sign and he got one. Cheney said the lightning traveled through the microphone and it developed a preacher, but he was not injured. Afterwards on Tuesday evening services resumed for about 20 minutes, but then the congregation realized the church was on fire. And the building was evacuated. It sounds like a scene from passions. The forest fire department quickly doused the flames. Damage was estimated at 20 grand. Forest is about 60 miles south of one of the most horrible places on the face of the earth. Toledo. Evermended Toledo? No. Don't. You talk about the armpit of the universe. A soft floor to is paradise compared to Toledo. And then again, so would the Cheek Toogabe any place. Buffalo is dynamite compared to Toledo. Horrible place. Don't ever go there. Okay. I mean, you might stop there on your travels. Maybe like on a way to Chicago or something like that. Indeclably. Cincinnati. Like I said. North Miami Beach, hello. Yes sir. The latest anniversary of the autotown. I didn't have a chance to call. Well, darling. Kind of a listener. Thank you so much. And it's always a breath of fresh air to hear you. I've been listening to you since 82 at least. Wow. Or that. Any other way of calling, by the way, basically, sort of three things I'll hang up. I mean, the common afterward. One of the Godfather series movies in general, very, very good. tremendous acting, camera shots and make up the whole nine yards. Very good. It's hard to put a finger on one particular actor because it's like a unit of artifact of all the characters. Right. Make it with the movie together. And secondly, I haven't really mentioned the well-tuned movies. You know, like network with such a tremendous movie because the cave is grew some future what's going to happen. Right. Absolutely. And the other one was the movie Tucker with Jeff Briggs, you know, with the biography of a press and Tucker of the automobile. I remember it ever saw that. The role is tremendous. It's just that it shows how the, you know, big three corporations just literally the story demand. I mean, just literally the story demand. And I mean, just literally the story demand. And I know that movie that just been out all fairly recent in this vibe. I think it was like, year 2000, and I think it's called Holiday's Heart. I don't know if anybody's ever mentioned to you or you've seen it or anything. No. It's the, it's the, the, the make up in it. It's the acting. And the story line is good. It's a novel. It's about a 50 year old black drag queen who represents a woman with a child who is on crack and is living with a crack addict, a pimps and gets beat up. Sounds like a lot of fun, yeah. Yeah. It has this acting instrument. It's just, absolutely. It just gets your heart. But anyhow, another thing is that I don't know if you heard this Dr. Kennedy lately been really getting on the ACLU. No, I have not. I don't pay attention to not. Oh, if it's a nightmare. I don't know. Real nightmare. It's typical old, the reactionary mentality. Yeah. I call it not to the issue of being a change in itself. Yeah, they should, they should take the cross off the top of his church. Just put a big swastag on it. Yeah. Well, holy and now. Exactly. Well, listen, have a great holiday. Pulse good answer. Good luck. Thanks. I need it. Thanks. That was interesting. The way that like chopped off there. Maybe that was an act of God. Dude, good. Here's a fashion line, who says, please head my, oh yeah. How come we left Tom Hagen off of there? We did? Didn't we? No, he's not. I could win. Oh. Well, I'm, I don't know if he got into it. He's doing very well. Well, scared to hell out of me. Scared me right out of I, uh, pantaloonies and German Irish. Lenses. I don't have the voting option online today. Well, we got him on here. Lynn, don't the panic. Also, a car to guilty show yesterday was complaining about Scott Ferrell's voice. Woo, woo, woo. That is, I wish I'd have given anything to hear that. Can you imagine that somebody calling into guilty? Of course we know his obsessed with. Up the butt. That stuff. Complaining about Ferrell's voice. She says, I'd rather listen to Ferrell than squeak squeaky boy any day. Have a great holiday, Lynn. You too. Wow. Kelly, shame on you. Oh, I took a lot.

Something you've blown at friends along with your nice silence. And I got a question for you. How can you have so many people in Miami not seeing the gun? I don't think they know that on DVD. You can listen to it in Spanish. Oh, I never thought about that, you're right. I had a man I see it. Another thing. I thought about that. And for a survey on your internet website, you could do it. People will listen to your show. How many web positions are sex in the have while it's on the air? I had a blow job. When I listened to your show about five days ago from my friend. Excellent. It was kind of exciting. And that's why I heard something. In the bedbline was, we need to gun get the canola. Okay. Thanks, Kelly. I'm going. See you. He didn't even say blow job.

And we got some streets and roads. A lot of cops with radar. But other than that, uh, you know, we got the, uh, saw grass. But you know, the saw grass is an implantation. Right. That's sunrise. As you get a little bit further west on that side of the street to become a sign. Because the line is like Ziggy's Ag or something like that. Or maybe because the people of the saw grass didn't want to be involved in plantation. Because I think that the zoning laws are so restricted in plantation. I mean, you talk about Boca and the on signs. Plantation. You can't do just about anything. I think didn't Jeff have a problem with his, uh, pizza loft sign there too. I think he did. He wanted to put a sign like up by the street because you can't see him from the road. And oh, you can't do that in plantation. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. But you're moving. No. Yeah.

Since we hate Walmart so much and they're trying not to be so magnanimous for everybody. Walmart stores and the nation's largest private employer will not include gays and lesbines and its antidespermanation policy company officials said yesterday. Company spokesman Tom Williams said the policy will not affect benefits, which Walmart does not offer to one married partners of any orientation, but he said sexual orientation will be added to the company's existing diversity awareness training programs for employees. And I'm assuming if any Americans who work at Walmart come up here to Canada and get married legally that they're going to be recognized and they will get benefits because it's got to be recognized in the US and they're going to recognize us Canadian merges. You follow what I'm saying? And I'm top of all that we still hate Walmart like poised. Okay. They surely rod. Nasty, right wing miserable. 560, here's a call from West Palm Beach, hello. New York. Yes sir. You want to go? Yep. Hey. My buddies are here. We didn't get to hear this. When I went out with the back was the rail. What happened? Oh, that was a set up deal, man. He, you know, sucked me into that thing. It was a fireworks night and a fourth of July thing. It was a special deal. Plus he's getting free. He's at the fountain blue all summer long. He don't need my help. Hey, you know, kind of free. You better, you better. I've got that one. Yeah, he's got one. Okay. I've got a great day. You're out of material pal. 560, have I done one to Marco? Yeah, in a lovely Johnny Depp. Didn't see it. Yeah, I'm wrong. I did see it. I don't want to see it again. It's a little bit of a TV. Almost went out and got that DVD. Think that I remembered. Don call me on a 66 year for 69. I can't say that. Your favorite character from the three godfather will be done. Call me on a 69. Michael 63. Gotta go to the house raise there. Never saw no godfather. 39, 11.7% shame on you. Shame on you. Get with it this weekend. Sunny 38. Clemenza 23. Look at Bratzi 23. How'd you like to try to feed those two? Tom Hagen 19, low green to I love mo green. In fact, if I wouldn't have voted for Don call me on it as much as I like sunny and Michael and everybody else in the flat pomemns. Because I can really I love mo green. Do you know who I am? I'm low green. I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders. There was just, I don't know what it was. There was just something to look about him. You know, slick is olive oil. Frankie, potentially 11. Get his body out of the bathtub. All right, starting to stink. Fratos got 10. And Hyman Roth has got eight. You know why that is probably because they drive by his house where you still have an hell and they'll. No, no, seriously. They used to be that scene. Because everybody talks about Marlanski on the beach, which is true in his last years. He did love on Collins Avenue. But the scene that they picked it in Godfather 2, there where they're meeting in his home and he's watching that football game. That's in hell and they'll. And it looks just like it. It looks just like hell and they like the average age is about 100. We could probably find that house. I guarantee that house ain't there no mole. In fact, that be for you to book a mole was a negotiating the invite at place that joint. He was such a wonderful man. He used to walk his dog and Collins Avenue Mr. Lanski. And of course his son had that problem at the forge that time. Oops. Sorry. Listening. We love you, Mo. We love to rip you an ass. What would we do, seriously? I mean, he made our life so miserable for everybody. You know, it's what a good mood we're in now that we got for real. And we got that big separation and most on vacation at top of all on. But well, no, actually we probably would have had a much better time. Well, seriously, I'm trying to rationalize it. You know what the best of this year wouldn't be as good. How's that? That's true. The best of would not be as good without mole. But it's a good make no mistake about that. And when he finally leaves when he finally blow his nasty old Lanski out the door, we won't be able to pick on him no mole. All are quite frankly, I guess we will. I believe he could leave that here.

And Godfather 3, my favorite line, maybe not the best line, but my favorite was when Sofia looked straight at Michael and said, Hey! Just one word! He's hard to run that reading, you know? Maybe I enjoyed it so much because she was picking a bullet right through the chest. You know, right through the heart, the audience applauded at the table. Yeah, standing ovation man! Two men couldn't have been a little bit sooner, like about two and a half hours earlier, Sofia. Don't spend it all in one place! Oh boy, she was just brutal talking about having no shame. A Tennessee middle school, a lot of security cameras, yeah, who the hell was talking about this? Was it... Guilty? Somebody called Guilty about this this morning. Yeah, what's guilty? Yeah, I know. I think it was for real. Maybe it was being a boy talking about it. A Tennessee middle school, a lot of security cameras to film children, undressing in locker rooms, and then stored the images on a computer accessible through the internet, according to a lawsuit filed by a group of angry parents, it's called PD, pedophiles Delight. The lawsuit filed last week in federal court Nashville, six four point two million dollars in damages. The parents contend the school system violated students' rights by putting hidden cameras, and boys and girls locker rooms at the Livingston Middle School, the cameras reportedly captured students ages 10 to 14 in various stages of undressed. I've actually had the rectumary man is doing line-off as business on that website. Can you imagine? Oh, God. That's what they're saying. What about a neck? The parents have known that's a book of Brian. The parents have been devastated by the conduct of the school officials by the video taping by the breach of trust at attorney Mark Chalose who represents the parents of 16 girls in one boy. Oh, that must not be checking out yet at the rectumary. It's only one boy. Chuck K. Goliath for overtime county school said he wouldn't comment because he hadn't read the lawsuit. If you take ink, the company that installed the surveillance cameras in several overtime county schools was also named in the lawsuit officials with that company also are mum. Parent-flared to the cameras when a student reported a suspicious device in the school at Livingston about 80 miles east of Nashville. Oh, you just got a love Nashville. The lawsuit contends the images captured by the cameras restored on a hard drive. In the office of the assistant principal could be accessed from the remote computers by the internet. It claims the computer's password security had not been changed from the factory default setting. In other words, it was their default. The images were reportedly accessed 98 times between July 2002 and January 2003. Sometimes late at night and early in the morning and two internet providers in Tennessee and South Carolina. The assistant principal has been transferred to another school system. And best part of this is they say they don't even know if the cameras are still operating or not, but they're going to check it out. What it's out, they'll take a peek. Off a lot of the surveillance crap going on. You know what I'm talking about? You'll. Since it is the fourth of July, I realize it's just a commercial thing and fireworks and barbecues and stuff like that. Hopefully a lot of our accusens are spots coming up next. But I don't think anybody anymore thinks about the meaning of any holidays, but it's veterans day or memorial day or the fourth of July or Labor Day any of that stuff. That's not all commercial. So this business about the Declaration of Independence and when in the course of human events a bunch of Nazis deal the election is not what it said. Nobody cares about that stuff anymore.

It's where I got there so fast. He was speeding up, but he couldn't catch him. No, I have to all about that. I must confess that I have had the opportunity because cats are pretty dumb. I don't care what anybody says about how smart they're. They're stupid. Yeah. And I've had plenty of chance to run over cats and road up by me, but I just can't do it. No, they make a mess. You got to watch. No, it's not that. I'm not going to run over a little pussy like that. It's bad. It's pretty bad. Oh, no. I just couldn't live with myself. I mean, I must say that I would like like a dog. I would slam the break and I would swore into a tree. I would do anything to avoid a dog. I would have done those ducks. Those nasty meat. No, I have not. I don't. I'm not interested in killing living things. Okay. That you were interested in. I might make an exception. Absolutely. But I'm not interested in like. Squeezing the life out of some living creature. I mean, cats. I don't know what they're probably. They'll do one of two things. They'll either dart across the road real fast without even looking. I mean, I mean, even the arbet dillows and the cunes have got more common sense than that. You know, sure. Like you drive it at night out there like by me. I'm not in the country kind of although almost they be cornered. I was going to a house on it. But there's still a lot of possums and cunes out there. Right. Right. Well, the raccoons are thriving in the urban environment. But they'll look around, you know, before they cross the street. I mean, they get that deer in the headlights. So I put nevertheless at least at least there were where that they'd pass it like run in your way. But a cat, they'll either scoot across without paying any attention at all or they'll like kind of mozi along. And it like right in front of your car, maybe they're daring you. Maybe it's like an active suicide. They got their agenda. Is that what it is? So in other words, I'm interfering with the agenda. That's fine. I keep that in mind next time. 567.0560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. Here's Tamarack. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you today? Pretty good. All right.

Yeah. Is that what it is? Well, definitely the move but it's actually better to try it than actually and make the snake in the sauce on. So, you know what the new Bushite strategy is to what they do is they, you know most cities are funded by bonds. Yeah. What they're doing is in the cities that have legislators that they don't like to vote for the right wing agenda. They are not funding these bonds through their cronies to put pressure on them to vote the way they want on cultural and insurance issues and things of that nature. So there's like extortion going on the people don't even know. Yeah. That there are legislators are being called reverse bribe. Right. If they don't vote the way they want them to do they won't give them their... Not to mention all that we're distributing, they're trying to show up through like timely in Texas so that they can ensure that they have like, you know like a monarchy.

All right, sir. We'll call. Let's see. Wow, a shocker. Align 9. I tried to call earlier, but I couldn't get through, but listen, you know, who you forgot to put on the list? That's a favorite of mine. He's a more character with a lot of style. It's Chee Chee. I think the only line he had was in part two when Franky can't handle he is all drunk and goes, what are they drinking? He had Chee, Chenigo champagne and he goes champagne. And then he gets wasted when they try to smell champagne. And they run them over. But he's got the sunglasses. And a little, little mustache. Yeah. Yeah, I'm a whole lot of that.

All right, you too. Oh, good. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Yeah, so moving that if you see it once you keep watching, it's not a movie anymore. At that point, once you've seen the first time, all three of course, I'm mandatory. At that point, it becomes a part of your life. Am I right? Absolutely. No question about it. Absolutely correct. So we had him to the list. No. Okay. I mean, the guy, I understand what the guy is saying. He's talking about himself personal. But nobody's going to vote for him except him. He will. He had a nice head and nice little mustache. There he on, have any. Callos have one. That's obviously from some either woman hating guy out there or somebody will just lie into the hole us and anything. Clean it up. He's just beaten the crap out of her. They should be fighting, hiding in the toilet. And he's just beaten the snout out of her. And then when he gets the phone call when Centino gets the phone call, you notice how he bites his face. He bites his face. Oh man. Yeah. He's the side of his index finger. That's real. Yeah. Ice gone, sonny. James Khan, another one of our unsung heroes. He's a lot better than people given credit for being. Absolutely. Once Kathy Bates got a hold of me, was never the same again.

Don't be getting all these groupies out there going to be because now you're a celebrity. Really grabbing and groping you just because you're on a radio. Watch out for Kathy Bates too lately.

Can't think just, maybe they could get like insurance coverage and they could let us climb the ladders. What do you think? Right. Well, it's just bad luck. If they let the customer climb the ladder and then maybe if you go into what somebody else you hand them, the carton, whatever you want to generate, then you don't have to wait for like three hours to get away to that. And stand there very obediently like a school child at the counter. Stand right over there by the counter and will somebody will be with you right? It's hit or miss.

I don't see things since I got this big holiday coming out. I'd have a big blow out. When it's out, let's blow it out. Come on. Let's go. George, of course, you're going to take the calls. No, actually, this is kind of see I look at it philosophically. Now two years ago, I had like the whole summer off. Right. And then they decided like build a studio's here and it was an Amsterdam which are no longer in existence. See, in last year, keep in mind that the Amsterdam thing was really detrimental not only to the show, but to my health because I missed about half of those two new new new days. I was sick all the time. That's right. We got from that damn mill do we in nasty apartment and the basement there with all the mold and the, oh, God. Jesus, a plague. Oh, I think that's what was in there. I was sick all the goddamn time. You'll notice, I don't want to like knock on wood, you know. Right. I show up every day whether you want me here or not. No SARS. No SARS yet. No West Nile. No Mad Cow. We got the Mad Dog, but no Mad Cow. But the fact of the matter is that I look at it philosophically because now like, Friday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday, and then you got a four day holiday for a vacation. So if I have a, it's having many vacations. Right. Because if it's one thing we like here on QMS having a lot of vacations. That's what it's all about. In fact, went for Ralph in his first vacation tomorrow. That's right. That's right. The beast will be on 8 to 10 of us. So stay up late tonight at July 4th. Either way and sleep in really tomorrow till dinner boys, there's plenty on bits. Gonna be great, isn't it? Dinner boy? Of course. Here's the call from Carl Springs. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yeah. I'll put it right. Who could brought these real name was? No, I do not. He was arrested on the, he wrestled on the name of one of my contaminants. Well, that's right. I saw it on the thing. I've looked at that before the show this morning. Yeah. I used to live next door to him and co-pay out on Mongamon in New York. He was a hell of a big guy. Oh, he was. Thanks guys, too. Great guy. How bad. It was a vibe with all kinds of kids saying he's helping him out. You've got stuff here. The fat people are the good people, man. There you go. Thank you. Have a great one. Thanks. Lenny Montana was Luca Bracci. Let me worry about Luca. Don't call you on. Yeah. He was good. And of course, the scene. What was that guy? I don't know what the guy that stabbed him in the hand. The Celucos stabbed him in the hand. And then somebody else reached the window. The one that held his impadded his hand on the bar. One of the goons. One of the taglias. Yeah. One of those goons with another really nifty hat. Yeah. Five, six, seven, five. So taglias goons here. I was Barzini all along. Oh, sorry. So you get it right. Up until this day. Here's North Miami Beach with a star. Hello. North Miami Beach. I'm not going to press my lock in. I'm saying. Right. Hollywood. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I got questions. A particular scene in the Godfather. At the beginning of Connie's wedding. When Luca Bracci was out in the garage fair. And Tom Hayden was receiving death in the dawn study. And told after told, it's not that he's a lupid. He wanted to see it. He wanted to see it. On his, uh, uh, Randall said, wow, it was necessary. Is this really necessary, yeah? Why is that? Why didn't you want to see him? Because he wanted to go out and get involved with his daughter's wedding. He was getting impatient. Because he had all these assholes live. That wasn't personal. It was his business. You know what I mean? All right. Have a great day, pal. See, am I right about that? Done. Luca's just a soldier. I mean, why are you wasting my time? You're just a soldier. Get that on me. Yeah, you know, you're taking a spary first. Right. I would agree. Five, six, seven, five, sixty. He, there's just something about James Cohen. He starts doing that thing out of the corner of his mouth. What was the movie I was just telling you? He was in the night. His right. Oh, no, not misery. The other one. And I told you where he started talking about the, the way they're going. That's right. You haven't seen it yet. I haven't seen it yet. It's good. Pretty violent though. I don't know if you can. No, not really very good. I'll probably. Next time we head yesterday about what's his name. We're need like, how many day or whatever. How that kid's name is. What's his name? Who? Just French kid that acts in there. Come on, be in there, boy. That's right. Ryan Philippe. Philippe. Philippe. Philippe. I think we're going to have dead air from tentative to Marathlete. Can be in there, boys. Going to be just laid out. Or just laid. I think you need to go to the same opium part of that Bob the Nure was having such a good time. What's the pilot time in Marathlete? Get a little pipe action. Water pipe. Sir. WQAM. Speaking. Yeah. What happened there with Luca and when the godfather said, you know, I really have to see him. Right. It was in the book, because I'm just going to read the book right now. The book is great. I read that way before I saw the movie. I've always seen it one time. The movie one time. It's amazing how vivid the scenes that movie stuck within my head. Now, but he's in the book. He says that at the beginning when he talks about Luca that's a godfather doesn't necessarily be here in Luca, but he makes him very uneasy. Uh-huh. And that's why he was getting like a little shaky. He's like, I really have to see Luca. I mean, all these things are very scary. Very scary guy. Right. So he just made him a little uneasy. That's the one thing. I know the law was over. You mentioned, you know, what should you be doing with the bedtime stories on the website. Please leave them on. Oh, we were. Just, it's just, I can't even tell you. If you want to bomb my head with it, there's so many of them. I need like, you know, a day and a half, you get through the website because, you know, I get them a little slow, but I just love having it. And you do such a great job. Actually, thank you for it. Okay. Have a good holiday, pal. You too, ma'am. Thanks. Okay, there you go. There's a guy that appreciates the massive efforts. And the bedtime stories will continue all the way through the summer. By the way, Biner Boys taking personal responsibility on the days that I'm not working. Keep that in mind, Biner Boy, as in starting tomorrow. You got it. And I have. It's he, it's he, it is bad to shape as he sounds this week. He's been really comatose. Of course he haven't got it. A bigger part? He's been busy doing one. That time stories, things like that. I see. Excellent. After all, a little distance away to get some of that, sometimes. Got the schedule on there for December. And he's got to cover our CD right above Dancing Dwarf Mo. I'll tell you. If you really bored to that, just click out of where we got Dancing Dwarf Mo and just sit there and stare. It'll keep you occupied for hours. Make no mistake. What are you going to do? Nice college boy, yeah. They want to get mixed up in the family business. And now you want to go down to police, Captain One, because you slapped you in a face a little bit. What do you think? This is the obvious way you shoot them a mile away. You're going to get a close like this. The thing you blow that brains a lot with your nice side, Relic suit. Come in. You're taking a spare portion. He is too good to be treated. 26 after one at 5 60, out of any who else is great, Chuck Alfieri.

Trash television. 131. Good and 90's here easy. Here's a whole bunch of facts. His Keith and Vokus says you're killing me. Got a question for you guys in the godfather during the wedding scene. Some guy throws two or three sandwiches to that kid. Paulie, when he throws them he else something. What does he say? I think he's talking about Clemenza with a Paulie. More wine. Yeah. Right? That's the only thing I can think of. Right. It's big crack Clemenza. Paulie. More wine. That's your lead time. I can remember. Also Greg and I may later ask. We'll be forward to that one. Here's one that says from Robin Poverty, I can't remember the name of the Think Tanker with Web address you mentioned three months ago. It was right we in content putting it very mildly. And mentioned he was needing a small war for some BS reasons. Could you mention the Think Tank Statement Web address? I needed desperately. Grammy-Nationing it's my right wing Christian brother. Thank you very much. I think you're talking about a P-Nack project for the new American century. I think so. I think I take that. P-N-A-C. Just do a search P-N-A-C and you'll find they actually have their own website, which is kind of scary when you read their own crab and then you can read about them too. My people will expose them for the bunch of lunatics that they are including our governor, Jeff Bush. Oh! And our president. And a bunch of other Graham. Greg and Mommy Lakes. Why is Michael Corley only so special? I saw Godfather one in two twice. I thought Michael was kind of boring. Please explain the fascination for this character. Wow! I mean, compared to a Santinoe certainly boring and compared to Don Corley only. And compared to a Joey Zaza, he doesn't make a Belafagura like Joey Zaza. Right? He's low key. I don't know the word certainly isn't boring, but he is low key. He's endearing because like he's the war hero, the common man can relate to him. He's not so much of a Guido. Yeah. He's the war hero. Came back and just inherited the family business when the old man got sick. He was like filling it with wood at whole brine. When pop was in a hospital with his assassination attempt. And he loved his father. Right. And then he got smacked in a mouth by a McCloskey. Right. He's quick. He's quick. And then they hit a little a clent. Nice dinner at Louise in the Bronx. Which there is a Louise in the Bronx. By the way, we've already been through that. Let's be on the city. So there you go, Greg and Mommy Lakes. You're right. He's a little bit low key, but I don't think boring is the right word. And if you didn't like him, that's okay. All of he is winning the pool. Which I would not agree with that. Michael 107. In fact, I would think that Don Corleone and Santino both got him beat easy. Oh yeah. Right. Yeah. But he was in all three movies again and keep in mind based on that other guy to call before there's only five people that were all three of them. Michael 107. Your favorite character from the three godfather movies. Don Corleone. 100. Never saw the godfather. 79 of you 14.3%. 79 of the people in the pool. Santino, sunny 59. He should do better than that. Come ends of 39. Look at Brotsie 37. Tom Hagen 34. Mo Green 26. Fredo 16. Frankie Pintensia. See the people like Fredo the best. They probably can relate to him. Well, this is smart. Yeah. Not done. This is smart. Fredo 16. Frankie Pintensia 15. Hi, man. Roth at 12. Check. Walks up to six. So fear five. McCuski 3. Vincent 3. Connie 3. Tessio's got three. So let's go to Carl Carl O'Wann and nearie don't have any. Although he does eat a mean box of chocolates. I was a bit of thought would have been Clemenza. Now it's the smart move. Tessio was always the smarter one. That was another good scene. Where they're sitting there at the funeral. Right. And Michael is sitting there and Tom Hagen comes over. After Tessio comes over and arranges the meeting. 5.6.7. 5.6. 5.6. On the AT&T and Verizon. What am I doing? We're doing screen most, right? Right. I'm in coherent. WQAM Hello. Good. Hello. Yes sir.

Do you know the name of the event? So look it up with what you're doing. Oh, geez. I mean, how many concerts would you have had July 30th in Toronto? I see. It's the SARS benefit.

And once again, Neil, you're awesome. I'll see you at the border. Love you, baby. Okay. See you. Have a great holiday. Okay. There's a guy coming up.

Anyway, we asked that are a poll today and please be sure to look at our poll because if you're confused about the schedule, it's right on there. Being a boy that is usual, stellar job, not only are you getting that on there. I'm getting the summer schedule, but also getting the cover for a vizgeniel CD, which comes out in August.

Okay, who's your favorite character from the three godfather movies, Michael Corleoni, 1116. Even other one guy thinks he's boring and he's a little okay. He's not as exciting as Don Corleoni's got 107. Never saw the godfather 84 14.2%. Let's see how many votes we got, 589, almost 600 and we got over 14% never seen it. Which I guess is good because if everybody would have seen it, then what are we accomplishing? It's like preaching to the choir. But here we can buy all of this hysterical and enthusiastic talk. We can encourage a bunch of other people to see it. Santino, Sonny's got 66. Plumins of 43, Luca Brazzi 37, Tom Hagen, Reston P. 35, Mo Green 28, Frankie Pentagely 17, Fredo 16, Hyman Roth 12, Jack Waltz, is got 7. Sophia 5, Captain of Class VIII, Vincent III, Connie III, Tessio III, Solato II, Carlos got one and now Niri has got one. Everybody's got at least one. I felt so bad for Niri. You know, because we all appreciated the job of the D.R. Bishop. Right. Now Greg and Miami Lates says, I almost forgot to have a great summer vacation when you return. I'd like to hear the highlights of your vacation. Making it sound as though like this is my last show to the end of the summer which I only wish from your mouth to Greg's ears Greg, another Greg. But no, I'll be on Tuesday and on Thursday. All through the summer, Georgia's doing Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Tomorrow, of course, is a holiday. So, Bina Boys is going to be playing a bunch of bits and crap and stuff and probably farting stuff like that in between. And if you heard from him, it'll be the real thing. So have a great July for holiday and Bina Boys and our Georgia'll see you on Monday and I'll see you on Tuesday. Bye. And all I can say is, All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
