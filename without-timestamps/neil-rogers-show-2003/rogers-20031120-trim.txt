We asked you whatever happened to Maddie Bell. Oh, he's a little guy kind of funny looking We have told with all my way back home. We know that I got nowhere to go. Let's try and mess you up. I'm talking to the man and the door. I'm asking you how to make some change. But he has said, look, body, I just want you. If you want to watch a picture for all the main course, this one's only a set. Take it up with the maddie, the double hole. I'm fading into my touch. I'm taking a picture of the stars, look, how I just told you. But now he's got to embellish me in the camera with exact changes. Playin' it, everbody's up, I have a poster with a mirror. I'm feeling a dying of time, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. Come on, come on, let's play Joe. Come on, come on, let's play Joe. No. Thanks. That damn fact that I can't stand it. Then I'll tell you at 5.60W to come. What a day, huh? What a freaking day. Where do we start? What? What's something just happened? Not. I'm listening to the audio. George has piped up the audio from Channel 4 before the show this morning. Oh, something just happened over there. The FTA, A, and Miami, the ride police are out, a little bit of tear gas. They tore down the orange, a fence, it's in a big heap, and what else? Anything else going on? No, a lot of pictures. Oh, I'm watching it right now. 10,000 protesters expected my meat later today. And all it looks to me is like a massive people. I don't see anything going on. Do people waving some banners and signs, huh? Oh, something just happened like something just happened. A few people, and then the TV, it's just amazing to me. What a bunch of assholes we're talking about. Oh, now wait a minute. Something just happened. You see that? Yeah. Stuff will be now. We're starting to get some scuffling. The ride police get ready to move in. Police doesn't hear it. South Florida for this. There are at least 25 hundred police officers from 40 different agencies. State local and federal who are on hand for this. The police have said that she chimneys to the Miami has set right along. There will not be a repeat of what happened in Seattle in 1999 when they had some three million dollars in damage and hundreds of arrests. You said that will not happen here. And so far, police are keeping a lid on it. What we've seen this morning, we don't have to keep it all in perspective. They were very minor scourmishes that police had anticipated and expected from the folks so far. Anarch is that are mixing in with the peaceful protesters. And so there was something certain that these things would happen. And today and tomorrow, which the official thing is the ministers themselves from the 34 nations have begun. The Huckabadjans are all on CNN seem so calm as opposed to the hyper-ventilating assholes on channel for. Oh, something just happened Michael. I look at that. They're up beat non-easher. I mean, one hell of it getting so whipped up into a frenzy. Oh, because it's a good for ratings. Sure. Okay. Well, did this? Yeah. Oh. Where the hell do we start? We got Michael Jackson. We got Rush back in deep crap again. We got the FDA. We got the big blast in Istanbul. Kilt's 26 injuries at least 450 this morning. Shocking blast. Really? That's right. It was a shocking blast in Turkey, not just the regular ordinary pedestrian blast. Here's the pull results from yesterday because I can't afford to get we two far behind. I might not even have time to get that. Oh, here's our favorite caller online. I'm WDQAM. Hello? Yes, sir. Hello, QAM. You stuck, Faggot. Yeah. Okay. We know you're not. 951 votes on the pull so far. What famous living person would you like to think is a role model for your daughter if you had a daughter? Some of you do, some you don't. Some you wish and some you won't. Can't we re-clint into an 18? San Brideo Conner 120 to Odeck College from Channel 4 Newsroom? I'll be damned. They know about suckin' just ask God the weather for a whole tidier. Hillary Clinton 2018, San Brideo Conner 122, that's shocking. Marine Dowd 96, we'd be proud for a daughter like Marine Dowd. Pretty spears 94 to bring home the bacon. Oprah 93, Susan Surrandon 91, Jocelyn Elders 70. Nicole Kidman 65, Maria Shriver 64, Natalie Mainz 38. Those are the only names we had on a list. That was it. Now here's pull number one for today. We'll get this on there right away. Based on what you know, what do you think should happen to my end by the way? Anybody that got all panicky here reports about the evacuation of the White House? I think what they missed a word there. They said there was an evacuation at the White House. Somebody had a wild BMW this morning. They said there was evidently a plane that got into the White House airspace again briefly like I had a little bit lost. And there were like a few people that like went running out on the White House lawn. The sky is falling and nothing's going on. Nothing happened there. Because obviously I'll present these in England anyway. He's hanging out with the queens. Based on what you know, what do you think should happen to Michael Jackson? That's our pull question today. We got to six as usual fantastic choices for you. Send him directly to jail. Reporting to Thailand. Give him a fair trial. Nothing. He's a great superstar. Let him run for public office like Arnold. Or cut his balls off and use the skin to remake his nose. That was the I think those are six great choices if you ask me. But then again, I created the pull. Based on what you know, what do you think? And he's going to surrender to pull. He's later this morning. Keep in mind it's only seven o'clock in the west coast. But later on this morning, he's going to turn his cell phone. And Mark Gerer goes, what did I tell you? You just know what he's going to be one of the attorneys. Doing a great defense. I think Mark Gerer goes could have a bad couple of months here. You know, well, let's hope they televised the trial. Or would not be great. We can just put it up to the OJ thing. What do you think, Michael? Is he going to wear the gloves and the mask in court? Just one glove. Oh. Based on what you know, what do you think should happen to Michael Jackson? Send him directly to jail. Be poured him to Thailand. I think having him and jail would rush would be a perfect match. I'd love to see that. Don't think I'd be right before the show with the guy that was the. Anyway, send him directly to jail. The port him to Thailand, give him a fair trial. Nothing. He's a great superstar. Let him run for public office like Arnold. Why not? Every like a big hot shot star has got to be like Governor President. Or cut his balls off and use the skitter we make his nose sounds good to me. Now, you just kind of like threw me off because there's all of this late break in Stuff coming in here beside the fact that there's a bunch of people getting shoved around and dumped on Miami. You people a channel foreman. What about your assholes? Idiots. More on. Here's a call from Miami. It's probably a spy report. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Okay. Boy, this is off a loud. Uh, perhaps this is an echo inside my car. No, it's an echo inside our pot. It could be anyway. The thing about Michael Jackson, these should obviously be tried like anyone else, but you've got to get some kind of special treatment. Because how long you think you're last like an in general population or ready for something like that? You mean, can't like Father Gagan? Yes. Something like that. Something like that. I don't know. Anyway, you're the best. I've been listening a long time. However, I haven't heard actually I wanted to tell you that Hank, Hank, and some of the other guys were playing your Moa Ronda Gaston bits all afternoon. Good. Excellent. Oh, and I'm glad you mentioned Moa. I'm going to bring. I'm going to drag him out of the closet then. Guy, get your might in me with all the other stuff going. I almost forgot. Thank you. Yeah. That's great. Any Moa bit to good Moa bit. Okay. Have a great day. Yeah. No Moa, my dear. I just want to say this right now. I'm sure he's listening on his way up to Boca, even if he's already there. I just want you to know, we're on the end now, man. We got the evidence. We got the smoking gunmo. Okay. We got the smoking gun. And I listen for about three minutes. When I get up in the morning, I come in here. I open up the pot. Then I smoke it. I mean, I open up the pot and I listen for a couple of minutes. And then I put on the, I open up my pot with a TV audio. So George knows I'm alive. And then I go do my stuff. All my ablutions. Yeah. He's gotten, now, just like anybody would put on the ear. He's got this core of ass-looking sycophants. All Mr. David, you're play by a play. It's so wonderful. I take off those checkered pages. Yeah, blow it out to your ass, Moa. And I'm going to tell you right now, it just makes me want to Pooke because these people, if they had any idea, well, some of them are just ass-lookers anyway. But if the public had any idea, the connish and anagons, if this man has been involved with Prover, you're at that radio station, which now I have poop. I got the smoking gun, baby. I got it. Your ass is grass. So your comment about payback is a bitch last year. You know something, Moa, you're right. And the day is come, it's not a question of if it's just a question of when. Govarn yourself accordingly, okay, Moa. You are dead meat. Because the kind of garbage that you've been pulling behind a scene, and see, there are people like that. They come on the ear like Mr. Nice guy. And there are buff at all, and above the frame, all the other crap. And behind the scenes, which is why this man is gotten canned. Everywhere he's ever been. I, I, I, I, everybody he's ever worked with. I hate him like poison, including just about everybody inside that building. It's a maybe one or two butlickers, not kind of imagine who they might be. Can't you? No. But this, the buck stops here, Moa, I'll tell you that right now, because you are the lowest form of subhuman scum. Slime. Smigma that ever encountered. Forget about like I said the other day, forget about just an radio business, just in my life, in 61 long, and excruciating years, where I've met thousands and thousands and thousands of people, some of them, great people, good people, decent people, some of them real assholes, some of them like kind of like non-escripted between and you, you're in a separate category. Because as far as life forms are concerned on the on the on the food chain, whatever is underneath the barnacles on the bottom of a ship at the bottom of the ocean, whatever is crawling around underneath the barnacles you're it. You piece of turt, you disgusting nasty, miserable, hateful, backstabbing scumbag you. What are you trying to say? He's a piece of crap. All the crap you can unwrap. Yeah, I'm wrapped this. In infinity fights, I'll be an Anthony fine. How's that protest come down there in Miami? Are you just missed our good friend Juan Mendieta? I don't want to hear a mom in the yellow. Because he's still sitting on the mayor finger for game of shoulder, not a shoulder. Oh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Reckham infinity fights, I'll be an Anthony fine. Viacom's infinity radios decided it will contest rather than pay the $357,000 fine actually a series of fines. The FCC is levied in connection with the famous opian Anthony stunt of the summer 2002. The stunt resulted in WWE WFM in New York and 12 other infinity stations carrying the show each being hit for $27,500 fines. Although the fine is one of the largest we've seen, this is in the radio business report today. So one of the largest we've seen come on the FCC in a broadcast remain at least one commissioner, Michael cops didn't think it went far enough. He wants to look at revoking the station license in such instances. RBR observation, though, says, the WWE WFM violated the law of the city of New York, but that doesn't necessarily make an actionably indecent. Had the WWE WStumpin caught on videotape, it may or may not have been actually indecent to actionably indecent. It's all in the camera angles. It may be illegal to show sexual behavior, but that's not necessarily the case when one is merely implying sexual behavior. Infinity's case will revolve around this concept, WWE broadcast non-explicit descriptions of the incident, none of the famous George Carlin heavy-seven words were used, it's quite possible that infinity can witness one in court. How do you like that? You go boys. Yeah, you go boys. Stick it to him. You know what I mean? I, I, I, yeah, you're dead meat man, you're done, you're finished. You might as well just roll up your damn smelly old piece and just call it into a corner somewhere in hide. We got the smoking gun, man. And like you said, pay back his abitch. Just keep in mind, Mo. It's not a question of if. It's a question of when. 1013 at 560 WQM Imagine on your next mortgage zero closing costs. Imagine zero application fees, zero credit bureau fee, zero discounted points.

Authorities are investigating whether concerted radio, tar show host Rush Limbaude. You legally funded money to buy prescription painkillers. The law enforcement said on condition, of course, of anonymity. It's always on condition of anonymity because nobody wants to like. Get involved. Get involved. On the air after we hit. On the air after we hit. Limbaude's spine. When's day with the blankets and all of the allegations first reported Tuesday by ABC news? I was not laundering money. I was withdrawing money for crying out loud. Limbaude said the three are broadcast. You see, the fact that he's been backed into wall on this. But wait till you're this one thing about he would you cash 30 to 40 times from his account in about system to 10 grand. So it verifies everything that the made said. Those inquire stories that I read on the year. But these thousands and thousands and thousands of pills that he was taken. Not just, you know, he wasn't just took. He was like, oh, big time. It was like office ash. Maybe he was just withdrawing money to go through the drive through at McDonald's. That could have been it. Maybe he had some deals at McDonald's. Like OJ was doing a parking lot alleged. OJ and a what's his name? What's that punk? Kato? Kato. How soon they forget? Anyway, Willembaude was absent from a show for five weeks after announcing was entering a drug rehab program because of a deserve to probe prescription painkillers, which then near caused me to go deaf came pretty close. You notice how easy these assholes get off the hook on his stuff? Guess I have noticed that law enforcement sources in Palm Beach County were level on say 24 million dollar ocean from mansion previously confirmed that a criminal investigation into a prescription drug ring involved a conservative radio commentator is former made will McClient reported to the police.

I'm sorry I may not get a single point. The exit had for us. A lady. The police are starting to ask me. Why are they pedestals being blocked with altitude? There's a few huh? There's a Marlins cap. Or is there a Marlins cap? That was the perspective of our John's Rela and James Hamilton. Anyway, Limbaugh and Fracking. It's just think about these two guys. Did you know that according to a recently taken poll taken by Gallup far more than double the number of Americans have an unparable opinion of Rush than Al. It's not even close. 51% are down on Rush. Compared to only 22% who are go down on Al. But there's a reason almost half of Americans never heard of Al Franken despite his years on Saturday Night Live. His movie's books is about well-polished-class with Fox News earlier this year. You can't say that about Rush only 9% of Americans have no idea who his ass is. Let's see, and they got the favorable unpeirable uncomedy opinion list of Oprah, Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Phil, that one makes me want a gag. Dennis Miller. Oh, geez. Al Franken and Anne Cotter. Oprah, favorable 73% 20% unfeirable uncomedy only 1% no opinion 6%. Rush Limbaugh, favorable 34% unfeirable 51% on for media with a 9% no opinion 6. Dr. Phil, this is just amazing to me. Dr. Phil Agra, 48% favorable only 16% unfeirable 26% uncomedy have no idea who to let the slob is and 10% no opinion. Dennis Miller, 41% favorable 20% unfavorable 30% have no idea who to held on his Miller is 9% no opinion. Al Franken, 16% out where to how was this poll taken? This is a Gallup poll. 16% favorable 22% unfavorable Al Franken, 49% have no idea who he is 13% no opinion. That's slimy bitch and Colter 11% favorable 10% unfavorable 69% unpromed. I'm sure that's just a coincidence. Unpromed, you're 10% no opinion. Well, what bunch of alquos they must have taken at pool from? Maybe they took it in Minnesota or in North Dakota in America. Speaking of fargo, I got it right here. I got these special edition. I love the way they package CDs and DVDs now. You have to take off your DVDs and send a breeze or to have enough energy just to get the packaging off the DVD. But I got a pool kit in an hour. Right. Special edition, Francis McDormand. That's interesting about how her name is on here and where do you make mace? He's not even on the cover. But she was great. She was phenomenal. Right. And he was great. But she was, she made the movie. Francis McDormand, fargo, thriller by the co-in brothers, Harry and Saul. And it was very good. The ending sucked. The ending was too abrupt and it just looked like that's it. I mean, just like you said about Magnolia, not that this movie is as good as Magnolia, it's not even the same league. But the ending is just, I'm not going to say it's for us because I didn't enjoy it very much. But the ending was weak. It was very weak. And you agreed on that. I'll show you. You got to deny that. No, no. It was a little like a classic. Okay. Here's the play based on what you know. What do you think should happen? Michael Jackson. 80 votes. Cut off his balls used to skin to remake his nose. You got a new nose coming, Mikey. Give him a fair trial, 12. Send directly to jail 10. The important to tie land three. He'd have a good time there. Let him run for public office like Arnold. Three. And one says nothing. He's a great entertainer. All right. Yeah. Don't he get a free pass? Listen, if the priest can get as many free passes as they get. Why not poor Michael? He's been misunderstood and he was abused. 10 27 at 560 WMF your mattress has been abusing your back because it's lumpy. And bumpy and it feels like crap. Time to get rid of it. Time to throw it out.

Rick put the gun and gun like my life says. It's worth my girl for so. Does I've been looking around when excuse just plain my words? You can recognize me. My doctors have reached out my ethnicity and I keep children around and they've left inside my back. And people say that I am gay. That is why I'm married to these memories. It's way too late to come and say with this song. That's really bad. Oh, I'm glad I got a baby. Oh, I'm glad I got a baby. Oh, I'm glad I got a baby. Oh, I'm glad I got a baby. Oh, I'm glad I got a baby. Before you touch me, I'll call me free. Let me find and love and say. Are you sure? I believe in all my child. Okay, don't touch it again. You said the circle Michael Jackson bit was just the best. Was that blame on my child? Can you please play it again? The Michael Jackson tour is the best. What? Oh, I got it right here. I like a best news. But here's some good news. See in the middle of all this stuff, the demonstrations downtown. Michael is a pedophile alleged and what else? We moved from office this morning and the governor's office was expected to do the memory placement. Oh, yeah. I never thought I'd say anything good about Jeff Bush. Nice going, Jeff's your baby. You go, boy. And how's Columbus doing with all the illegal goods she's smuggling? Shortly after 10 o'clock this morning, elephant was served with an executive order sign by Florida Governor Jeff Bush. We're moving her from office. It was served by Broward Epidies at her main office at the government center. Hallelujah. There is a God. She was reported to be an immediate with her staff in her office at the government center. Unable for combat after the announcement was made this by the umptious buddy, nivens of the son, several locks were ordered to replace it. That's always not a good sign about coming back. You know, when they say we're changing locks, that's it work. Yeah, that she's going to need you to pick the lock. Locks were ordered replaced in her orifices and deputy's expected to take up positions and secure the voting offices equipment and record. We had a lot of jack food in fact. Look at that. I need police march toward the protestors. But time to shield as if we're preparing to continue on the protest. Yeah, I'm not fired anymore. But first we're into the cloud. Yeah, I think that maybe if they didn't have any of them cops done. They're manning call me crazy, but maybe they just be having like a little a a bunch right now, you know, you're crazy. Put out some picnic tables and just have a little lunch and funny thing. They were showing earlier as though the cops threw a candidates here. Gas into the protestor crowd. Yeah, through it back. How revolutionary. Did they say back at you? I think that's what they did. A lot of were consued fans down there. My police mart and of course they're showing the pitchers. No, not a goddamn thing going on. Nothing. There's nothing happening at the moment. Look, I'm sure if you're on channel 4. If you do on channel 4, oh my god, something happened. Oh, all those deals. Yeah, oh, no, that was definitely not going. You see that big bird. Yeah. Yeah, I got that big bird for you on a radio. Take a look at it. You dumb bitch. Jesus Christ. Police you spray on dozens of protesters at the FTA. A talks. Well, now see here's some other. Now these pictures are they currently from before this show. I'll get one man back. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. We saw before it. See, this is what they love to do. This is CNN. They love to take footage from earlier when they were like scuffling and you heard all that a lot of forletters were divided. A lot of crap going on. And but that was before. See, now they show the scene. There's not a damn thing going on. And those people are just waiting to get into the goddamn basketball game. Anyway, Miriam, elephant, bye bye. Has John McLaughlin would say. Bye, bye, bye, yeah. Go let the door hit you in the ass and away out on a long overdue. Those were the words that you spoke and you were absolutely correct. For once man. How long and you know the blessing here is that goodness before any more elections take place, especially like in 2004, like presidential elections and all these other things. God forbid that this totally incompetent broad should have still been in there. I mean, she has basically threw these last couple of years. Helped up a sign saying, I'm totally incompetent, but you won't move me because I'm black. And there's a bunch of crazy preachers out there saying, they make an individual racial issue. Miriam, we don't care if you're black, white, purple, yellow, green, purple, but polka dots. We don't give a flying crap here incompetent and nice going, Jeb. Okay, when you're right, you're right, which is the first time. How do you like that? Yeah. Based on what you know, what do you think should happen to Michael Jackson? We asked cut off his balls and use the skin to remake his nose 83. Michael's getting a brand new nose. 144 votes their porn and already. Give him a third trial, 28. Send him directly to J.L. 18. That sounds good. And like you said, or like I said, just put him in a, I got to do his like for a few hours. Get the guy that off the father gig and you know, on a cell block. Just stick him in there. He don't like Peter files too much. And see what happens. They'll come up. Let him run for public office just like Arnold 9. Nothing. He's a great superstar three and department Thailand. Three. Yeah. Where's that other facts I got from like what kind. Oh, here it is. It's one about the plane at bit. It's just in my opinion there's so many awful issues here. Number one about Michael presuming this is true. And that it happened after the widely publicized allegations of 90s. What could parrot would allow their child near Michael? And not only allegations, but if you recall Latoya, she, she verified it. She said there's no question about it that he was a, she found all of those checks that he was paying off millions of dollars. That damn fact I can't stand it. Right. There was no doubt that he's a pedophile. Everybody knows that. We're all the children that were there. All the boys that stayed there. And she is the one who always said that Michael, excuse my expression, but he's a fact and she would say that damn fact, I can't stand them. The damn fact I can't stand them. Okay. We get a little toy just dummy up pitch. Two, what about the staff so to speak at never land? The staff of life. How could they stand by Latoya's things one previous? Well of course he'd remind he's rule in the roast. You know, he was the dictator. So they like, kept their, but keep in mind, wasn't it one of the maids? Right. One of the servants that out at him on the first thing, and was in that book, remember in the authorized biography and told about all the stuff and find the kids, the underwear and all the other. And the fact that he didn't, he used to poop in his pants. There's something wrong with his creature. Okay. He didn't even, times that he was a locked in a room there. It is a little kid's eating even farther going to the bathroom because and I'm sure he had very, very lovely facilities there, but he was too busy at pooping in his pants. Maybe he was in that too, I don't know. Oh man, were that? Yeah. Three, the masses will largely see this as a gay thing, just another perversity of the gays. They've been brainwashed by religion to believe that pedophilia and homosexuality are the same. Well, guess what? They're not, but the people that want to believe that will just use that as another excuse for their hate, for their bigotry, for their stupidity, for their neural mind, and this, and you know what, who the hell cares? If they're that stupid, who gives a crap? Like those people, like, like the people of infargo. Oh, man. So keep in mind, every time they take a national pool, keep in mind that those people, where they're taken to pool, right? If they take a pool, like an civilized place, and then you say, well, I might mean something to me. For example, that pool from the Houston Chronicle I gave you? Mm-hmm. I get to that story later, but the pool is really, we're talking about Texans, urge ban on gay unions. Texas Republican leaders on Capitol Hill press the other day for a swift consideration of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage on a hilly hillside that ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, allowing same-sex couples to wed and receive the same legal rights. So the Houston Chronicle shirt, to this pool, over 5,000 votes, should gay marriages be allowed? No. 53%, yes, 45%, underside of 2%, 53 to 45, which is then theirs, but that's in Houston, Texas for crying out loud. By the local businesses, it's 560, the radio's on yours. Oh, I got a QA in. Um... Hey, more you're a scumbag, baby. Oh, yeah, I got that something. I'm making it in my glass. Yeah, you, I make it boy. And I'm your name, Lame. Yeah, I'm your name, Lame. Yeah, I'm your name, Lame. They seem so sweet to me. With their firm little cans, little boys, you should be with me. Yes, I'm a damn Lame. Yeah, I'm a damn Lame. Yeah, I'm a damn Lame. Hey, little kid, I'll give you candy. And all right. You can sit on my left and I will. Let you drive, let you drive, let you drive. Yeah, you, shake your mouth in. When you wear your little pants, don't tell all this little secret. Because I'm your Name, Lame. Yeah, I'm your name, Lame. Yeah, I'm your Name, Lame. And when I shower, I'll invite you inside. And when I touch your little pants, I get high. Recto. I get high. I get high. Oh, yeah, I got that something. I'm making it in my glass. Yeah, you, I'm making it for me. And I'm your Name, Lame. Yeah, I'm your Name, Lame. Yeah, I'm your Name, Lame. Yeah, I'm your Name, Lame. The time of your old boy, I had to set her the Michael Jackson child molestations. Candle may have confessed to his side-ciatrists that the puffsinger applied him with wine and sleeping pills when he allegedly molested McCormn to sources. 12. A bigger pardon? You said 20. I said 12. The 12-year-old boy, that's exactly what I said. I think you better check George Faroxy-Cons is here and start it and we have it on tape. Okay, what did I say? Roll it back. Let's hear it. Roll the tape back. Roll the tape back when I said 20. If I said, I would beg Greg's life on it that I said 12. How much money? How much money am I putting on it? Roll it back. From coming out of the last bit. Come on out of a bit. You're a rafnap. He's a case of now. When I rolling a dot, he doesn't think we're rolling back. Roll it back. Roll it back. He doesn't have any force going to roll back. It's you that rolls it back. I got pin back. He's circumspect. We don't have all day. We're going to have a heavy plate man. And such were like one of the thing. And that's not good. Rick and such that's from the previous segment before the break. We're going to such my ass two minutes ago. I'm doorstep. I can't wait. That's what we say. World pass broadcast. Maybe this is some other town. He's got to win a robot. Yeah. I think he was on the 4.41. Yeah. We're not putting him on. He's surprised. We don't recording the go. Okay. Look, we don't have time to fart around with us. Okay. Leave him out of this. The 12 year old boy, the center there. You threw me the whole band show off now. What are your crap? Also recorded my source. Right to Roger Friedman from Fox News. No less. Jackson. No one's so much ago that the boy and his family had serious complaints about his relationship. I'm trying to get rid of them. I mean, not to get knock him off. But he bought them passports and played his ship them off to somewhere in South America. Front of the boys family. A mother and siblings told me. In fact, this says the source Jackson kept the family at Neverland for a period of time. Hoping to convince them to drop their allegations by lavishing them entertainment and further Mirramant. Remember him, Jim Irman, Jr. No. How about Tom Irman? Yep. According to sources, the boy who made the allegations was a cancer patient whose last wish was to meet Jackson at a time that his friends and family feared his illness was getting worse. Jackson paid the family's medical bills and assisted them financially. Even by them a car according to sources possibly in a house. When the boys' condition improved according to a family friend, Jackson brought him to his Neverland Valley Ranch. That is when the alleged inappropriate contact between them is thought to have occurred. At some point last, Green the Boy's schoolmates apparently aware of his relationship with Jackson began taunting him in public. In one case, an incident of harassment is said to have occurred at a gas station, prompting the boys mother's secret legal advice. The lawyer she met with advice sending the boy to a psychologist, according to my source of the psychologist, had enough concerns to report his conversation to the police. Oh, that would be a job of the idea proposed by the police. Now, this is not seeking civil damages at this time, or anticipating a cash settlement similar to the one that happened 10 years ago. In other words, they're not just doing it for the money like has happened in the past. They want justice, right? Right. And for justice, we must go to... Don Koyom. That's right. We've heard that before, though. Yes. That other family. Well, it's a bargaining chip. Right. The bargaining tool. And when the price gets high enough, I say, well, forget about justice. We'll take the money, thank you. He's a nice guy to restore the freight train. Anybody can see that. Well, are we straining some of the people down there downtown? They need to have a full list of banging their batons against the side to their shield and their shield. Oh, this is all, yeah. It's also pathetic. It's also ridiculous as what it is, you know? And a lot of these outside agitators that come into town, all they do is make themselves look like assholes. And they've got some of them like pinned down on the ground and you know when they start, I was watching them where they were searching them, you know? And reach around in their pants. I think that's what they were looking for. And if they should find like a joint or something like that, oh, man. Tended 20. No questions, Axe. They'll do a lot longer than Michael ever will. Should we take some calls? I wanted to. Hey. Here's Papino. Hello. Yes, sir. I want to say about our business. Okay. Good. We've wondered. Here's a little Havana. Hello. Hey, is there Michael Jackson to relax? What is it about that? Michael Jackson. What? To relax. That sounds good. All right. Send to find Sodom. And also at the same time, you can find the killers of Nicole and Brian. You're number one, you. Okay. Thank you, Polly. They got nothing to say. I thought we could get a lot of calls on. It's with all stuff going on. I mean, just like I thought we could get a lot of calls when they had the Marlins big parade down time. Remember that? Oh, make a line. Nothing. I heard books down in the crowd. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on a AT&T of Razor Marlins. Mary, a elephant gets canned. She's out. So, Brian out loud. Where's the excitement enthusiasm from the South Florida audience? What's with you, people? Yeah. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Conferring the evacuation of the White House. There was the flash. Not too old ago. And my theory of dialectical checks and balance. Okay, great. What we have here is they figured to. Five, six, seven. Are we going to get any sane people today? No. I think it's their old gun nuts. I think they've all lost it. As far as the eye can see. Down or high, or in the England. A little bit of British government. Thousands and thousands and thousands. And they're going to end up here in Chicago Square. There are already several thousand. A hundred thousand predictive for the AT&T of Razor Marlins. They were rallying London. Nice going. You go boys and girls. Ladies and whatever you might be. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. How's it going? Listen. I just made a random thought. But you know what? Tensions wouldn't be running so high downtown. If these guys weren't running around like pigs, they're in batons and looking like the Nazis. Swaps are going. Right. That's correct. That's what I said before. People are looking like, you know, they're expecting. I don't know. Strong. Strong. They look like stormtroopers. They look like those. Yeah. Stormtroopers. They look like a. Duffator's boys over there. Right. Nice outfits. Anyway. He'll take the easy and. Okay. Okay. He got nice batons though, man. They're wielding their swing and their batons around. Looks like a baton. Mary of Melafin is gone. Oh. You're right. No matter whatever else happens today. That's a real great piece of news. That's party worthy. That is worth a big party. Based on what you know, what do you think should happen to Michael Jackson? That's our first pull question today. 102 votes. Cut off his balls and use the skin to remake his nose. 107. Give him a fair trial. 50. 7 directly to jail. 27. Let him run for public office like Arnold 12. Nothing. He's a great superstar three and deported to Thailand. Only three. I think they deserve him. I still say the idea about father Gaggin's murder. I think that's where I just introduce him would be good. You know, just briefly. He got a little break a little bread together. We should remember his name. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay. Neil, in reference to Michael Jackson, I think the individual should definitely be tried this time. They should gather the evidence and definitely follow through with the entire trial. And I don't know how it's evidence. They have in terms of pinpointing, but they should figure out whether even if the boy family didn't go through or they had enough statements and deposition taken, making go through with the trial and possibly convicted. And the guys at these are works. I mean, a character of a person, you know, acting as a predator. Amen. Hey, great job, man. Have a great day, pal. 560, 560, pound 560 on the ATT. I'm a little distracted here because I'm reading this thing that you sent with me. I knew nothing about. We got a van hit today, 5 to 7th of publics. 411 South-Sacrist Creek wrote in a pombotopee.

And I'll come call me big brother from a better file And I'll know what you desire I just sit for a while and beat it beat it beat it fucking I hate beat it beat it beat it My goal checks it Sometimes I'm too depressed I just sit around so can't wait And pull a call from the cone Go get it When I'm home alone And make it by the phone I beat it beat it And be one of the five lucky boys To receive backstage passes So hang out and get Michael Jackson's dressing room Michael Jackson's benefits And hey, yeah, I might go Yes, Bobby, is that your real skin color? It's inside the couch Like I know a game that we can play to find out And since we're blind You know it's time to free willy If they say what you want But you know who I To the fraction we don't know How to read what's been so important Give me a reaction And here's a rousing finale As Michael sings the song he wrote For the children of the world With the Vienna Boys choir Back in Mimo I don't like girls I like mission rooms They are the ones who turn me on I hope they're with me To the choice of making I might screw up their lives But it's true They make you think it's made We're not just by Here are other great Michael Jackson classics Like Billy's James You know how to tell time And of course, Bruce Kermittles You have the Michael Jackson's tour It's a bit of the cargo crashing school The way we're boys Get your tickets now Boys and pretend it's free When a company buy no one I feel white I feel real to be the type I feel white I feel really tight I was talking about you Listen to what I just heard it man That was the best All time best you can't argue with me because it's the truth I won't Can't and I did say 12 Miguel check the tape Okay I'm telling you check your hearing man You're taking too many of them pills Wrong one Captain Rick says I don't agree with Michael Jackson's behavior at least But Let's be fair Where was the god damn police? And there are 70 trucks and search warrants When the Catholic priest were doing the same things Just Captain Rick Why do you have a good pod? Captain Rick the only problem being There's a lot of similarities there Because the Catholic priest got away with it for years And years and years And covered it up in the night And they got moved around from one And a parish to another And the same thing here with Michael In fact they said 14 weeks they've been putting these charges together They're going to arrest him And they excuse me what I had Halloween And there were a lot of visitors to I mean come on I think they got a call to the other day And made the point I think at a good point The same day That the Massachusetts Supreme Court says that it's It's not legal to ban gay marriages On the same day we get the Michael Jackson announcement Could be just a coincidence So I'm just saying No I'll put on paranoid anything like that This article about the FTAA by several Michael Edgisco I'm going to read it a little bit Because most people don't even know what they're all about Or why these people are protesting or what they're doing there Although they're not much going on right now No nothing John's a royal physician The president and the leader of the right They're right in the midst of all of it here You feed from the police officers There's just a few people in the middle of it I don't know when you can sort of ask a ballerina start Anyway here's a call from North Miami Hello Hey my nail is up Yes sir A couple things Dubai Miriams I've never seen a day Great news huh Yeah I'm happy man I can't believe it's so long I mean that she was that was one In her case better late than never man Absolutely for all of us That doesn't guarantee we'll get a fair vote though But still we just one thing out of the way Another thing Michael Jackson He's a crap Hope they ring them up the flagpole And I will attribute of the dolphin signing a rendezvous Can you play that bit There's the one with the more hours when he's getting off Or run So got a run You got it You got it See it and that's the reason they signed a rendezvous They forgot all the bottom And then I played that bit a couple days ago Remember And then the low and behold Here's a rendezvous Back again So the guy basically says Michael Jackson's a piece of Yeah And there's a lot of going on in the world these days And it's about time we put it in and some of the Right Including killing all of these innocent people Which nobody seems to care about I just I'm sorry I must be a moron You know what I'm saying But I just don't understand why there isn't more I mean here are these people worried about the FDA And they got a good point I happen to agree with them all of their methods is probably weak But But in the meantime Where the hell are all the massive protests in the US right now We had some sporadic ones here and here All of these kids that are dying over there All of these innocent people All of the Iraqis were dying You know, our liberation by the Computation night It's just not the way to do it Okay All of the lies that we're told Here's a frequently And then buses yesterday to the Brits Well, you know, we can't turn a clock back And whether you elected or not we're there now We have two choices We can either finish it or whatever What? What kind of an attitude is that? They basically admitted that they made up The whole bunch of horse crap about weapons and mass destruction Because they weren't any about al-Qaeda and the Sodom being asked But he's which they weren't had nothing to do with each other About 9-11 having anything to do with Sodom who's saying in Iraq which he did not Okay, well what now? Wow, he was a bad guy. Oh, I see We spent a lot of time going around the world Trying to emancipate countries from evil dictators Don't we? Oh, we sure is held on And I'm going to say it again Okay, with all the crap that's going on right now And George said it when he used that term about steering the hornet's nest That's exactly what we did And I keep thinking back to those ads that appeared in the New York Times The anti bush ads that appeared with mocking him with those pictures of Osama saying Go ahead and Veda rack that's just what I want to stir up all the Arab stir up all the terrorists in the world Stir up all the crap, poke the hornets nest baby And that's exactly what he did Because they already had this thing planned long before they stole the 2000-Lussian Magnumus take about it And he merkin published sits back Like this, we're going to get their next happy meal While our people died over there for no reason at all It's pathetic, it's tragic And I'm thinking the same thing with the Michael Jackson story The reason he was able to get away with it for so long is because of the media The media is, I know it's easy to say it but it's true Because the media's got such tremendous control In shaping public attitude in the opinion of the US because even at first of all the media Another country isn't like our media, everything isn't just show business And number two, because Americans watch so much more TV than any place else Right anywhere in the world And so just about we got two generations out of people Everything just like Howard Beal said in that work the only thing they know is what they see on the tube Right And if the media would stop glorifying pedophiles like Michael Jackson And stop covering up the thing with a Catholic priest Well, you know, there are a few isolated incidents and then bring it on these crazy rabbit people Like that one guy from the adonni who got from the Catholic league Uh, this has got to stop You people in the media, man, you're a bunch of lunatics talk about your responsible And jackass is like Bernard Goldberg writing books about the liberal media You're an idiot too, Bernie, okay, you're disgrace You're disgrace to the human race Cut nothing to do with right wing and left wing, it's got to do with lies It's got to do with exploitation If we can get ratings from it, we don't give a crap what we say, okay I won't pedal any kind of crap just like Howard Beal said I don't care what anybody says the most important movie of my lifetime was network I'm not saying it was the best movie but the most important movie because it was told it is 30 years before it happened It told exactly what this country was becoming A bunch of television fed and controlled and manipulated Lemmings who can be pedal any kind of crap And here's Bush standing over there in London yesterday talking about Woodrow Wilson Every time I see him, I think a Woodrow Wilson don't you? Sure, all he's got to do is put on a pair of those glasses man And I think a- Oh look at that, that's Woodrow Wilson that professor at Princeton University Right Holy moly, I'm fact, forget about those glasses How about the Groucho glasses with a nose and a mustache? That would be more appropriate, okay? That would be more appropriate Jesus Christ And I'm sitting here on the ear on his bogus sports radio station What a bunch of screaming meanies running around, I haven't got the idea where their asses would be The wife today Oh, what are we gonna do, Greg? What are we gonna do? Much of silly people And all of this crap is going on in a world of nobody can say or do anything to stop it Or to get people angry enough to make somebody stop it If they were taken at like started to say, a hundred billion dollars gonna be a lot more than that But they're mortgaging your kids and grandkids and great-grandkids future's on if they were taken at money and fighting real terrorism The real evil doors, as he says with it If they were really going after Al Qaeda and wiping them out and Keshe it Osama Yomama and Mula Pula Omar and Sodam and all these other grave robbers Then would be accomplishing something, are they doing it? No They're peeing your money down the toilet so they can put your kids at risk And send them over there into a totally unjustified so-called war and a rack attack While in the meantime we're more vulnerable than ever because we've we've stirred up that hornet's nest So you have this thing in Istanbul again today And believe you me you ain't seen nothing yet I hate to say it, but we all know it's true right Because they're everywhere Oh, we're gonna go and we're gonna roof them out all that cowboy talk Remember that and the days after 9.11 on bull crap cowboy talk Then we're live and we're gonna root them out of their holes and like a bunch of snakes Oh yeah, and it was rummisfile talking about we're gonna find them and they're sleeping We don't want to go into too much graphic to tell but nobody's ever gonna see them And yeah, yeah, yeah all this token dagger made for TV bull crap That's all you people pedal to us, okay? As far as making the American public safe, we're not why we're more dangerous now So all this business about well Iraq attack and Iraq and get rid of Sodam That's gonna make us safer, guess what? Bad move, bad idea didn't work There's more damn terrorist attacks going on now And keep in mind that Iraq wasn't a hotbed of terrorism before we went in there in March No, he didn't know a people no freaking way They had their own corrupt crack going on just like we got here on corrupt crap And then we got assholes were yeah, just like that Dennis Lewis are no the one I play yesterday The assholes on parades are right to buck three assholes in the market Oh, yeah, well now we find out the mutual fund uh, oh, yeah, air media is another scandal A final thought about a shell game like on at least on the prices right. They have a little bit of fun Bob Barker to yucks it up with a shell game But this is a shell game. It's cost us a lot of money Because even Wall Street is turning into a big fraud and here's Dumball over there in Britain We will finish the job.

Give him a fair trial, 79. 7 directly to jail 62, let him run for public office like Arnold, the Gropenfutor, 17. Nothing, he's a great superstar, five.

Miguel is going to be in Pompodot Beach between five and seven. Just for you. Just look for him. Spin the wheel for prizes to get the best meal merchandise. And our totalized of the moment is... Yeah. Is... About 30 men. Air Force Firejets were scrambled and the White House was briefly evacuated this morning after birds. This is my favorite after birds. Or possibly disturbances in the atmosphere trip radar that keeps watch on a striker space around the complex. Tippy-Headard machine standing nearby. Tripping the radar. She was tipping the radar. Yeah. Little Timmy. You know who else was handed and hanging out? I give up. Linda Tripp. It's a false radar targets at William Schumann. Federal aviation spokesman. When the no rat fighters got to the location of the alleged violation they found. Nothing. Maybe on that road. The North American aerospace maybe was a flying sausage. The uh... no rat is the command center for the defense of US grenade airspace. Good luck to us. Schumann said, Flax of birds, ram is very disturbances. Might have caused the false radar reading. Which was initially thought to be a plane flying within five miles of restricted airspace. Around the White House. Not that we're pankey, you understand. It's one of those electronic grimmlins that pops up. But there was no aircraft there. He said it just popped up. The president of course traveling in Britain at the moment at the time. And evacuation begot it about nine twenty this morning was called up within twenty minutes at secret service spokesman John Gill. No relation to former Maple Leaf defenseman Todd Gill. It was deemed unnecessary or the defenseman Hal Gill. It would deemed unnecessary when airspace violation was determined to be a radar anomaly he said. I'd be like that. It's a little bit panicky. And certainly we have tremendous confidence in the defenses of our country. No. After 9-11 we saw what a tremendously quick job and effective job they did in intercepting those hijacked the aircraft. Speaking of Michael Jackson. Yes. Do you want me to fax you three pages of transcripts from Yuri Geller on with Dan Abrams last night? Oh, okay. Why would I want to see that? Why didn't think so. What was saying what? He's his little brother. He's an asshole buddy. Isn't it? What about you, right? So what do we want to see that for? Wouldn't says it's pretty comical. I'm not going to read it. No, I don't want to. All that stuff. Not in the mood for comical man. I'm in the mood for heavy duty man. Really, really heavy heavy duty. A comical. Christ all mighty. And as somebody suggested one of our regular faxes, Glenn and I would that we ought to make Michael a Pope. And of course it looks like very soon we are going to be needing no holy five. He qualifies. No, he does not. He's not Catholic man. He can't be. I wish he's not Polish. He's not a 10. He's just a freak. He can be Catholic. Now that you mentioned he's just a freak. Maybe that's qualified. He wears funny hats. Well, he were waiting. We're still waiting for the shredder. Let's see. 838 in the morning out in our way. So I'm just to keep working with an IPO. We got the protesters downtown Miami. We got Michael coming on in to grow a surrender. He's coming in from Vegas to LA to surrender to his ass over. And just too many things going on all in the same time. I don't really disappointed at this performance downtown. There is not much of anything going on. Why is it peaceful? That's what we want. We want quite a peaceful. We don't want chaos down there. Okay. We don't want another Seattle. After they had a. After they had a. Now how many years ago was that? Two years like that. Yeah. After they had all that chaos, they're all sleepless in Seattle. That's what I'm hearing. By the way, everybody should watch Fargo. It's really pretty good. And the funniest part of that whole deal is. What the hell did I do with it? I don't know. There's so many funny. Oh, hers. No, the funniest part of the, you know, the fact that we both, I watched the movie and your recommendation was very good. And I said, you Francis McDormand was great. And I said, you know, who's you reminded me of? You said Cheryl. Yeah. And that was right. That was absolutely correct. Cheryl, we know, whatever her name is these days. Cheryl Rifkin that we used to work for at IOD. My, my, our group closed personal friend Cheryl. She's like, got a twin sister right. Although Cheryl could act like that. But she wouldn't be working with her with that mic. Disney S. Oh, she actually just fine. Francis McDormand man. She was great in Fargo. I'll say it again. The ending was very very. I just, I'm a connect. I could just kind of fit. No, I just like, like the, like the, like the, like the, Wrapping against the time schedule. Oh, it times up time, but just, I'm just wondering what I'm going to do right here. Get in the car. But the, very, I do see a similarity with Magnolia. And that every character in the movie was really very distinctive. I mean, like, character was like very strange and very distinctive and really bizarre. Yeah, and they are like that. That boy, they must have gone there and just studied the North Dakota. As a matter of fact, the two kidnappers, you might be a, but some of the people in our sales department. Oh, my, my. And look, this is for Trial 5. I'm a, Anyway, let's go. Let's go. She looks like a guy. She's seven feet wide. She's six feet tall. She makes me want to touch the sky. Not counting. Let's go.

Kevin Lake Worth-Baxon says does the Bush administration classify. Trucks did go round spring from mosquitoes as mobile trucks with chemical weapons. There you go, there's your answer, Jeff. Saturday, November 22nd, 1245 in a morning. In other words, before one in the AM, after midnight. On press, it ended the 2000 presidential election directed by Richard Ray Perez and Jones Seckler, while we back on the Sundance Channel of Edencin on it, 50 minutes. It says, as the punnets and repeatedly on election of a point to the idea, can't read this. That's all about the order. Why? They've refacked the clean copy. And anyway, citing a suspicious pattern for regularities and justices and purchase of African Americans from the voter records, the filmmakers presented a provocative piece of advocacy journalism that contrary to suggestions to just get over it, prompts outrage. Well, people ought to be outrage, pissed off and fired up, and also that when we get the 2004 election next year, everybody votes at least 10 or 20 times as against these fengest. And then, of course, this fact should at you keep us sending all this stuff to try to encourage me to read. I think you're scrolling these out. Okay. Yeah. Let's start reading it. So, I read when I'm ready. I don't feel like jump to uncommand. Okay. I got a lot of fish to fry here today. You smell it? Fish. Okay. Here's the second poll we're going to be doing it noon. Now, yesterday we did the one that we got a very lame response on it, and this because women are still a subservient. They're 10-class citizens in the US, if they know it's good for them. What famous person living person would you like to be a role model for your son if you had a son? We got a short list here for so far. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Michael Moore, Howard Dean. Now, those are all political or politically oriented, but you know, it can be anything. That's why I was so shocked at Hillary. One that overwhelmingly yesterday, what are you people thinking about? You want your daughters to be like Hillary? She is this. God. And then have offspring like Chelsea? Man. Give me a break. But that's what they said. She's a huge big. 5-670560 pound by 60 on the AT&T line, but this big. Here's West Palm Beach, hello. I'd like to dedicate the song to Spirot, T.A. I knew one of the biggest pricks of our time. Three, two, one. Hello, Vietnam in the sand. With George W. in command, we got a president with half a brain. Forgotten, far my and when after who's seen. Can't find no weapons or nasty germs. He's really opened up a giant can of worms. You're out of Europe, now, and I just run out of words. Oh, I'm standing. I guess he was serious when he said he ran out of words. Like my nonsense, you ran out of something around the words. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T for rise of our list line. At least Michael's going to get his nose back. And then of course, we got Saturday is November 22nd, 40 years after Dallas. And so this 8,000 shows about more propaganda here, but like, responsibly, Vli Harvey Oswald fired all 55 of them shots there in D.L.E. Plaza. You know, John Conley, Weston, peace now. And so this is why there were more than three shots. So you'd be on the shadow of it out here. He might just know because he was there. He might possibly knew something about gunshots. He knew a little bit about that being from Texas and being in the military. Stuff like that. I just mentioned that in passing. Anyway, so we got that color up and say, really heavy. Heavy duty. Let's see, Ted Kennedy's only interview with his brother, Friday 10 p.m. The Senate ratified that treaty in September. And then prospects were fought in the Cold War, the War Reel. See, and then focuses on JFK, APM, Saturday. I just mentioned that in passing too. Here's Hollywood, hello. Hollywood. Can we wait? Can we wait till about 130? I think Hollywood died. Here's Miami, hello. Yes, sir. Good. Good for you. 560 ought to be. 560, 70560, pound 560 ought to be AT&T and rise from our list line. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Here's a call from Bokka, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey man, why is Michael Jackson such a bag? And our last call is from Fort Lodderdale, hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah. But this is what you'll get to much. I'm a Republican at a Christian. Yes, sir. Both of us are unfortunate. Yes. Okay, but listen. I back you up 100 billion percent. Okay. On the situation that's going over there over the Far East, the Middle East. You're right on the money. This guy is a lion's gun bag. He has stolen the Christian. He's hijacked the religion. Okay. He's also, people most people don't watch these men. Okay. If people were toon in once they're out these men, they'll see that you hit it with stolen. Really? Who's the extra CIA director? During that time, wound up saying this was last weekend. He said that he was shook his head. He couldn't believe that President Bush, the father, allowed the two to be, to say, to get the curse. And he would stop there and we watched it happen. That's right. Okay. But people don't see that. You see, only watch it. There's stupid programs that totally ignore it. I mean, not only that. I ordered a tape from C-span, grossly 36,000. Well, or believe me, it was worth every cent. I can't think it's called a center of a government and a federal, you know, whatever. It's bipartisan. Right. To move. That is investigating all the contracts that have gone out. Okay. With the, in Afghanistan and Iraq, it's enough to make you want to punch you. Yeah. Well, we've had all those stories in our website. And of course, you know, we put all that information right on there. Unfortunately, if you were in fewer people are reading that stuff, if you're in our website, which makes me want to puke. But it's all on there. It's for people to want to, you know, make the efforts to find it. They want to swap all the sports and what this guy's doing and everything else. Don't tell me about it. And then what happened is when the fewer that's what we call my friends, when winds up that we become a fascist state, which we're almost there. Anyway, they're going to say, how did this happen? Because they don't want to take this, you know, they don't want to vote these thumbs out or throw them in jail. Well, I sure, I hope that come next November. You're going to be one of those of us who's been a vote them out. Oh, you got that right, man. Thank goodness for that. That's a lot, pal. I don't have a right to say. See, there's a Republican in a Christian and he's, you know, he's on to it. See, you just because you're a member of a particular party or a religion or whatever, does it mean they have to be a moron? Doesn't have to mean you have to be a sheep? It doesn't. Well, maybe it does. But this guy wasn't, and I'm sure there are a lot more like him. FTA tradingway democracy by Cyril Nicholetsko. The free trade area of the markets FTA will spread a freedom liberty in democracy to all the peoples of the Americas. This is one of the many tall tales free traders repeat in newspaper interviews on television radio programs in public debates. But if someone were to ask them to explain how the response would be similar to a deer in headlights, that's because it's difficult to defend a statement that has no factual evidence to support it. The FTA would actually undermine democracy by granting transnational corporations the ability to overturn labor laws in environmental regulations, thus stripping countries of their sovereignty and citizens of their rights to self-determination. Here's how. The North American Free Trade Agreement provides foreign investors the ability to challenge locals in federal laws of the West Canada and Mexico for cash compensation, taxpayer money. This is unprecedented as it allows corporations to sue nations for the first time in history. The FTA would adopt matters in vester rights and as a result leave 31 more countries right for the picking. This has the potential to generate an explosive number of new cases across the cases. A 2002 taxpayers for common sense reports said that in the US alone these investor rights could cost American taxpayers over 30 billion dollars a year under the FTA. Just as some are Canadian mining company Glamis filed notice of intent that it will bring a $50 million claim against the US for action taken by California to protect the environment and indigenous communities from the harmful impact of open pit mining. It's venue a closed-door arbitration tribunal with no public access or oversight. California's attorney general won't even have to have an official role in the case. Citizens of the state are forced to rely on federal government agencies such as the office of the United States Trade Representative to defend their laws in well-being. So the same office they help push through the legal framework that allows Glamis to file their $50 million claim is supposed to win a case against them. If you find this district you're not alone. The National Association of Attorneys General passed a resolution in 2002 denouncing the breach of legal sanity. The resolution states forward investors should have no greater rights to seek financial compensation than US citizens possess. Out of the US Constitution or the state constitutions international arbitration panels can be another international trade agreement. It should have no jurisdiction or authority toward financial compensation based on challenges to the rulings of US state or federal courts. Furthermore, the US National League of Cities, the National Association of Countries, and the National Association of Townsend Countships are among other groups that said. Letters to law makers lies year urging them to pass legislation that protects our laws and our citizens both under attack by NAFTA and possibly the FDA. So if the FDA is ratified that democratic process will be obsolete laws passed by legislators protect the citizens who voted them in office will be meaningless. Or instead local state and national governments will face ridiculous fines that will force the need to settle out a court, blackmail, or pay the fines to determine by corporate friendly arbitration tribunal. Either way, tax revenues that are desperately needed for schools, hospitals and other public services will instead be awarded to transnational corporations. These corporations can then pack up and hit the next country. It makes sense that free trade deals like the FDA are negotiated and drafted behind closed doors and building surrounded by a wall of police. Civil society is shut out because no one in the right mind would voluntarily forfeit safeguards to their rights and health. The only freedom extended on the FDA would be the multinational corporations. The free trade agreement of freedom to trample over our democracy, the freedom to discard labor laws and environmental regulations, and the freedom to build citizens of the hemisphere out of their tax money that will be used to otherwise for essential public services that would leave the rest of us free to suffer. At least to be free to do that. Lots of it.

Agra Terri could bring you west of its knees. That'll make anybody nervous like that one guy. He's afraid, not. Officials law makers in expert-tornies today, will be relatively easy for al-Qaeda terrorists to carry out a devastating attack on American agriculture, starting an epidemic that will cost the lives of millions of animals and regulations economy to its knees. It's like a fire that's out of control, Tom again at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, Agriculture, Settledy Spetafoot, Malphazes, you never actually get ahead of it. Foot in Malphae viral malady that infects clothing-hoved animals, including cattle, swine, deer, and elk, is the most virulent disease-no-demand. But it nonetheless remains subclinical without noticeable symptoms for up to five days, as result the panel learned, computer simulations prepared for the department that offensive agriculture show that a single attack could infect animals in more than 20 states before was even recognized. Again, said one such simulation show that even if all animal movement was banned after eight days, more than 26 million animals would have to be destroyed either because they might have been exposed to the disease or to create an epidemiological fire break to block the spread of the infection. Just mention that in passing, not that we ought to be nervous about any of these things. Because we're doing a whale of a job on round enough them evil doors, our way for a do it at baby. 400 votes on the first poll. Let's spit can at now. Get rid of it. Based on what you know, what do you think should happen to Michael Jackson? Kharapas balls used to skin the removies as we make his nose 211. Give him a fair trial 99. Send him directly to jail 72. Let him run for public office like Arnold 19. Nothing is a great superstar five, and department Thailand four out of haunted votes on Michael Michael Motorcycle we're still waiting for him to turn his ass in and the rest of him too. He would turn his nose in, but he don't go on. He keeps it in the box. Does he keep it in the wall? Maybe that's what Brad Pitt was a fine in that box. What famous living person we like to be a role model for you son if you had one. We got Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Michael Moore Howard Dean. That's our short list. So we got so far. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Horizon wireless line. Did I mention this morning at the Norma Kent is as useless as the boobs on a pencil?

There was the French mob hired and all the facts that they had based upon that there were three shooters including the Grand Finals. I have seen it. I've seen it. The fabric is zero publicity and every time it changes the channel there's Peter Dunnick's Jennings with the computer imaging that is going to disprove all the conspiracy theory. Right. I'm just nauseated. Well, these are the same media people that would have us believe that this president has a brain. So what do you expect? Oh, there is nobody there. There is none whatsoever. And in closing now. Okay. 5605050 5050. Panthers are pretty weak last night. There was nobody there for the honor game. How many people were there? About 30 minutes.

Pat Quinn is going to get the Schmidt can if Lisa playing crappy which they are. Bye bye Pat. Eat a slimy sandwich in a way out and go back to where you came from. Good guy, but you ran your course. And what is there a problem with the funds? Because I know as Miguel like out of the room again, as he like got to the races there, they're just, he puts them on hold and they hang up. Just another they haven't been on hold. You don't start making up stories. I'm sitting here. I'm looking at something. Yeah. I got 8,000 lines flashing, frankly.

Let's take you call from Carl Springs. Hey, how you doing now? Pretty good sir. Actually I had a quick comment about the microtraction thing. George had mentioned that he's been keeping his nose in a box. And I think if that were the case then he would not have all this problems with the little boys. Well, mama told me to keep his nose clean. Hopefully he got the good or not. Okay, whatever you have to hear. And I'm just saying, this is really sad. We're going to have another pool with no input from the audience. Just like yesterday. We had a lot of almost a thousand votes on it. But they got no ideas. What famous living person would you like to be a role model for your son if you had what? I don't think that's a tough question.

Because women are like, you know, just to be used in the Americans out all over the world. Not just America all over the world.

But would you take on that? What's my take? I think you may have a good point. It's a toiletist past and we got off the first time. Well, of course, it never actually went to court the first time because he paid them off. And he might raise the ante a little bit. And that family might say, well, you know, something we're really enjoying our time here in South America. And you've got a really good point. And we don't want to like interfere.

So liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar liar. Carl my teeth is fine, 60 WQM. Roger Friedman who actually writes him pretty interesting stuff, even though he's unfoxed news. It says, forget all these stories that Mark Gyrgos was hard to represent Michael Jackson just yesterday, or the day before. Where we all born yesterday, Gyrgos has been the case in Slast March. That's right, he says Jackson is known for most of the year, even if he didn't monitor acknowledge it that trouble was brewing at Neverland. The trial was now the subject of this molestation allegation began to raise questions about their relationship late last winter. Jackson was not completely out of touch with the reality, resuppided by bringing in the expert defender. Jackson's camp I am told is more than ready to do battle with his accuser and his family. I'm told that the mother of the child and Bob will be held up to severe scrutiny. If Jackson's side will likely argue that when he tried to break off his involvement with the helping boy in his family financially, the mother became and I'm quoting a Jackson insider, a scorn woman. She's very screwed up said one source, there's video tape of reacting weird too, and Michael was very kind to her even getting an apartment for a boyfriend. But the argument will be that when his woman who is financially so dependent as he claimed he would live in a barn, we told by Jackson's people at the party was over, she ran to a lawyer to see what she could get out of it. But as I wrote in this space yesterday, a lot of the evidence in the Jackson case will come down to video tape and there's lots of it too. Some of which may show the boy and his family singing the praise of Jackson defending and explaining his odd lifestyle. If so, they'll be hard pressed to explain their own behavior now. For example, in one interview last or winner, the mother of the boy told a reporter, Michael asked pet names for all of my children, and one of them even calls him daddy. He's the father they never had. She said all her children were hoping to spend a lot more time with them in the future. The sudden change in Jackson's schedule, by the way, throws a monkey wrench when his promotional plans for his new greatest hits album. Throw a monkey wrench. Right. Michael is on a Raj for three days away from leaving for Paris in Berlin when enthusiastic fans would have greeted him. Here in the U.S., the album is not so far made any of the early top 10 of the week list and major retailers like Tower, Virgin or HMV. On the coast, oh yeah, Yuri Geller. Yuri Geller goes on for too long. Here's a ton of facts you says, how about who wouldn't want their kid to grow up like mad dog? I think that's a good choice, right? Let's get your man to try and air right away. Oh, I got you on my head. Where you head to? Michael, that's why I voted for 18. Michael, he's got 18. Bubba's on his ass with 16. I got 12. I got a dozen. How are Dino 11? George W. Bushate and Jim Mandage for out of 69 votes. We'll take a few calls, but I got a read that thing from the Al Frankenberg because I called her degenerate immediately. Did we get that song? And we had a great song. Here's Toppo, hello. Hello, yes sir. You heard him all the time, right? But I've heard any money, but the election still has to be messed up. Based on what? Because she doesn't know the counting. You know what I'm saying? Those people are still going to be there. So the elections are still going to be messed up, buddy. In your hominized pick. Okay. Don't come play to the guy who thinks they're very multifunctional. Oh, let's see. He's incompetent, baby. And competent. 9 copies, penis. 560, pound, 560 on the out here. T. She had even circumspect. And it's Michael Jackson thing, man. You think here we got innocent people going all over the world. And they're all still hot up with Michael, Michael, motorcycle. On and on it goes. And here's the see this comment that's on and now what pair of would lather child their Jackson. And I agree, hardly with that. Maybe one that's looking for a big payoff, you think? Maybe. Like that bitch on her role though that day. I'll never forget it back in the early 90s when all that other stuff was going on the first time. Oh, I'd be proud to have my son molested by Michael Jackson. See, if she just awaited a couple of years, you could have been on with Jerry Springer instead. Here's a call from plantation. Hello. Hello, this is Victor Lov-Tobby. Yes, sir. And I know you love confide suit. Yeah. And you got him on the top five. Okay. 560, pound, 560 on the out here. And Verizon. Oh, but you should be here in South Florida with us. No thanks. I was there for a week. I mean, it is just scary. It is just pathetic. You know, you know what I'm talking about? There is nothing that's ever going to change. You can bet norms life on it. Here's Miami Beach, hello. Yes, sir. Canada is Janet Reno. Oh. Is line one working? No. See, the lines live up there. Oh, that's what's shown us off of our pointed rounds here. It ain't working. The light was lit up, so I guess fix it's got making it a period given us like the, you know, old beaten switch. You think it's working, then doesn't ring anyone. What's going on? Here's for Lauderdale, hello. Yes. Can't hear you, man. Don't whisper. Okay. Good choice. I like that choice. Good choice. Oh, man. I mean, brilliant guy. I'd like to hear. What? Is he nice to his mom like you are? Probably. He's probably a portion of daisies. Here's a call from Pompano. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. I just wonder. Yeah. Channel 4. I don't think they ever saw a bad cop in their life. What a display. That thing I wanted to say today was. I hear that Brian York Cross and a whole channel for staff. Love is their pork. Did you see Larry King last night? I sure as hell didn't. That's why I'm going to go. Oh, you can meet. Well, you're welcome. Oh, brother. I think it's on the marriage. You know, the family being destroyed. What do you think about the unwaid mothers? Do you think they're helping the marriage situation or something? They're doing a beautiful job at 50 or 60% of horse rates doing it too, man. Good job. Good job. Great day. I've been doing this a long time. Yeah, I know. You've been doing it. It's sucking asses. I'm not a Michael Panelon last night. He did that on Tuesday night. I swear wasn't even warm out of the box yet. He already had all those talking heads. And here's Nancy Gray. Oh, geez. I'm serious. It's just a hank and I were talking about when I was a down there on Friday. The hump or not had quite a discussion about Larry reminiscing about what a scumbag he was then. How he never paid anybody back. And he said he ran into him. I think it's Vegas or somewhere in the end to me. So why are you ever going to make good with all those people and floors? And that is good excuse. Because I probably 30, 40 million a year. And his line is, oh, that was in a different lifetime. All the people he ripped off and scanned his own photo. That was somebody. You scumbag. No, why do you have dinner with the rumor? Well, at least probably Larry buys anyway. 27. That's noon. Don't start on a memory again. Okay. Not me. I need another doctor someday.

Remember low fat? Low fat. I'm going to do the reading, because there are a lot of calls on there, but generally speaking they've degenerated really, really bad this hour. They all need to use this hour material. I'm not going to give us any more suggestions for my poll, which pisses me off. But that's okay. Like, line nine and Dallas, hello? Hello? Yes, sir. Yeah, I'll call the give you a suggestion for your... Just like I just couldn't be great. Like somebody with a little bit of an electric, how about... Noomchomsky. Noomchomsky. I thought the dial was a great... uh... named to put on there too. Right? Noomchomsky's fantastic. I wish more young Americans would aspire to... more intellect and... have a brain. I'm more knuckle dragger than anybody else on the block. Right. Charlie Manson would be another good one. Ha ha ha. He's a little wide, Amy. He's still alive. That's the bad news. Okay, pal. But where you're at? 560560 pound. 5... Oh, and speaking of a knuckle dragger's... Did you see the thing on CBS News last night? Those videos now that these punks are making these gangs? Which one?

If you have an IQ larger than your thumbnail, you realize that that's no say per miss on a key. And one say it just ain't done, right? Same people don't that beat the crap out of each other just for a fun in games. Oh, this is great. Somebody just facts this in from the York Times. Lawmakers the perfect expansion of the FBI's anti-terrorism powers. That sounds like a real winner, don't it? Sure. And Greg told me to go shit is a food to measure if they did with St. FBI's counterterrorism powers despite concerns from some lawmakers who said the measure gave the government too much authority that the public have been shut out of the bait as usual. The measure gives the FBI greater authority to demand records from businesses in terrorism cases without the approval of a judge or a grand jury. While banks credit unions and other financial institutions are currently subject to such demands, the measure expands the list so to include card dealers. Oh, look out again, William H. Macy. Juan Brokers, travel agents, casinos and other businesses. Well, that's great. As your feedings continue going down the toilet and the people out there are going, my de-com and same old crap. I noticed that the, what is this? Please don't tell me that's him. This is old file tape. He's sure ain't going to be showing up dressed like that. But after him. Look at that. Have you watched Macy in it? No long time. I am. And they decide to a quit based on those grounds. But as a legal defense, as something that, you know, he's thinking you ought to show a dress like that. That'll show them a thing or two. Oh, he's got snappy or does. And then they can do like a Ricky Williams thing. Just drag more by his hair. 23 to 1. OK. And the great Al Franken book, the York Times number one best seller lies in the line lies who tell them a fair imbalance look at the right. Chapter 14, Hannity and Comes comes in very small print and it always is in this book. As we said before, there's no better example of the Fox News channels credo than its leading left, right, debate show Hannity and Comes. A quarter-right limbo, Hannity's vigorous clarity inspires. As hardest team Franken tried, it couldn't find a similarly glowing quote from any one about Comes. But I told them to keep looking and hopefully have one for the paperback edition. To give you some idea of the show's fair balance, I picked a representative episode of the broadcast immediately following President Bush's 2003 State of the Union address. The point catapult pretty much broke down like this. This is a big vision. This is a bold agenda versus President Bush did a magnificent job. Quick, which one of the critical sentiments was expressed by the liberal. If you guess magnificent job, you're a winner. And you know who it's also a winner? Fair and balanced news coverage. The show's first guest that day former Reagan speech writer Peggy Nunehn was struck with how like Churchill, Bush seemed imbued with a special destiny, Hannity gushed. There were two lines that we just played that I really loved in the speech that we will not ignore, we will not pass along our problems to other Congress's other presidents, other generations, will focus on them with clarity and courage. Nunehn, we will do it now, we won't pass off the winning one else, we'll do it now. I think, do it now as a strong kind of sub-themed and a whole speech. I gotta tell you, this was a big and powerful and important speech. Lost in all the talk about not passing props off to future generations, was the fact that Bush was passing off to future generations they projected 10-year deficit of $1.8 trillion on top of the existing $6.4 trillion national debt, since then the projected 10-year deficit of isn't the 4 trillion. That might have been something for Koms represented on instead, he asked Peggy if there were any great lines in the speech that might live on in the public memory, thanks for maintaining the Burricade's Allen. Koms rhetoric may not be fiery but at least there's not much of it, and the state of the union show teamfragged in little rudimentary content analysis, they counted how many words counted how many words Koms said, and would compare them, Hannity, 286, Koms, 1261, and the letters, the letters and numbers in teeny tiny print for Koms. It makes sense that Sean Hannity is the Alpha male to Allen Koms Zeta male after all Hannity got to pick his little partner himself. Roger Ailes who has a real eye for talent personally chose the intelligent, soon to be supersed our Hannity to head up a show in prime time on his newly created Fox News channel. According to the New York Times, the show's working title was Hannity and liberal to be determined. After Hannity, the self-described arch-conservative shows Koms, the former stand-up comedian and self-described moderate, I'm quite moderate, told USA today reporter, Koms and his lawyer demanded that the name of the show be changed, it would be the last argument Koms would ever win. When I first met Hannity, I had no idea who the hell he was, it was 1996 in a green room at Fox News, I had just finished my first appearance on the factor to promote Rush Limbaugh as a big fat idiot, and was about to pick up my coat when I was confronted by what appeared to be an angry Irish ape man. Hannity didn't like the title of my book. I hope I'll believe in making Adhána Montaxi said, thrusting his John a characteristic display of semi-integration. Oh, that's why I titled it Rush Limbaugh's a big fat idiot, it's an ironic comment in the fact that Rush makes Adhána Montax all the time, you see? Evidently not. I've never heard of making Adhána Montaxi said, the Hannity, is that would later learn this was in keeping with Sean's season ability to lie and believe it really just lie. How about they called Chelsea Clinton the White House dog would that qualify? This was a very famous incident. On Rush's TV show in 1993 shortly after Clinton took off as an years before Buddy joined the first family, the show put up a picture of socks the cat. Did you know that the Clinton's not only have a White House cat Rush said poorly, but they also have a White House dog, then on-screen came a picture of 13 year old Chelsea. Sean was ready for that one, that was a mistake a technician accidentally put up the wrong picture. Really okay then tell me what was the joke, the Clinton's not only have a White House cat, the picture of socks, they also have a White House dog, what's the joke? What picture was supposed to come up? Alan comes with standing nearby, you know he's got a point Sean, there's no joke without the picture of Chelsea. But Sean would have none of it, it was a mistake, a technician put up the wrong picture, that's what Rush said, and I believe Rush. Okay, let me ask you this, it was a tape show, taped hours before it aired, out before an aired, if it was a technical mistake, why didn't they fix it with a correct picture, whatever that possibly could have been? Sean kept arguing his indefensible positions that are just giving up admitting that his pal Rush had crossed the line, at least in that one instance, after a couple of trips around the Barn Eye Q shot of intellectual dishonesty. Electrical dishonesty, shot back, how about the Democrats and King Rich watched to got Medicare spending? You're changing the subject Sean, when actually it's a 7% increase in spending increase. Right, look you could just admit that Rush deliberately insulted the 13 year, I mean talk about intellectual dishonesty. For some reason that set me off along before we were screaming at each other, I had never in my life hated a person more than I hated Sean handed it at that moment. Finally, comes broke us up and I love checking my head wondering who was that asshole? You're watching porn. Business Busch? Sports Waiting for my city? You ain't whatsoever Uh, rich, dumb ad. I liked watching the movies. Keys and Cre perspore was packed but they were unbelievable. It was an accident, as I couldn't looks at you.

Not a long list of names, unfortunately Michael more 33, built in 32 Jim managed 23 Pass me like I was standing still He arrived just 20 Howard Dean 14 George W. or 13 Corvette Alphabon No, I'm Chomsky's down on her because it's probably you and Eric to an out of spell it Oh, I thought I was a joke name No, I'm Chomsky was a joke name I don't know who the hell that is Like that one of the brilliant authors of our time Oh, yeah One of the brilliant liberal minds of our time No M-O-A-M-C-H-O-M-S-K-Y No M-Chomsky get with it Go read something That's right And anyway Going on here in the L-Frenken book He says fast forward seven years And that asshole meaning Kronhanna The now is the second most popular radio talk show in America Right after the guy who made the Chelsea joke 8 million listeners regularly sharpened their minds on the West Donov His rough sturdy tongue One of those listeners emailed me a couple of months ago判� to the extreme of her green room fraccus Only he embellished a little according to Shaw and I had been escorted out by Fox Security Another lie from Shaw and Hannity or was it? It occurred to me that I had been escorted out by Koms In addition to being Shaw's liberal honor punching bag Maybe just maybe Koms also worked security to tell the Fox In fact now that I thought about it is the only liberal of Fox Koms probably a lot of other odd jobs around the network As it turns out I was right In the odd jobs chapter in Ellen's new autobiography Back to you Shaw on the Ellen Koms story We learned that Koms duties as Coast Hill Coast of Head of the Inkoms include Adding toned to the copiers and critters Looth the anger as your alesness personal steam room And ordering Chinese food for editors working on misleading video packages A scripturalist removal of lent from Shaw's deck It using Ellen's trusty lid rower And it's show time Another fabulous show and after we had it maybe headed home But Ellen Koms days just begin Hello How you doing? Morning. It's lonely being the only liberal of Fox But Ellen doesn't mind. There's so much satisfaction to be had Not just from occasionally getting a word in edgewise on his own show But from hearing Roger Aels chuckle when he sees the little papers You're creating hand-atized for your protection That the former comedian carefully plays across the sea of the toilet And is private bathroom If you haven't heard of Koms book Maybe because it's been overshadowed by Handardy's own page sooner The New York Times bestseller let freedom ring The book lays out the conservative party line And everything from A to Z where A is for abortion and Z for his apply side's economics Amazon.com reviewer Ronald Ohandowski of Huntsville Texas He gives the book five stars and calls Shaw in the new conservative genius It is review he goes on don't listen to those other jerks Or only waiting the book with one star to bring down the average Whether or not let freedom ring deserves one star or five depends very much on how one judge is books If one relies on the uninformed or old Andalski approach A five it is. However team fracking use the more sophisticated approach We ask questions like is what the book says true and how could Handardy be so incredibly obnoxious And why would any sane person buy this book? To arrive at our rating team fracking way to the first question is what the book says true 85% more heavily than the other two questions combined This may seem unfair to Mr. Handardy who is will demonstrate below Does not understand percentages You think according to our waiting system which start with the lies Instead for reasons too technical will be explained here I'll just start with the incredibly obnoxious stuff Here's a doozy pages 145 to 6 Pandities ran about the absolute abomination that is the New York City public school system After rattling off some grim statistics about test scores he says Sity instead education officials didn't seem to have a clue about what was going wrong Is the teaching ass-day education commissioner Richard Mills? Is the teaching practice? Is it the material? Is it the students? Workstoodins are doing? What are they reading? What are they writing? What kind of math problems are they doing? What are these people doing with our tax dollars if they don't even know the answers to these questions? You should know dear reader. This is our read these right-wing books. Often scroll notes in the marks of why reach this particularly nugget. I wrote Returico question asshole It sure seemed like Mr. Mills was dramatically illustrating his commitment to examining every aspect of the state's educational system In his quest for excellence in higher standards and that Hannity full of content for both his readers and the truth Was twisting this good man's words into a new civilized In fairness however I went back to the article Hannity was quoting the examin Mr. Mills' words for myself Was he his Hannity implied bumbling around hoping that someone would tell him what he is kids in school were doing all day? I'll report you decide. Here's how Mr. Mills starts When you look at schools in relation to the accountability system New York City schools have a long way to go Now for a little context Richard Mills was the person who had created that accountability system In fact just the year before Mills had been presented with a prestigious corning award for excellence Because among other things he had said tough to lack it in my standards and required rigorous testing of all students progress The difficulty of the test that Mills himself had imposed had led to low test scores handed aside and back to the article There's no simple fixie said I would peel the onion. I would ask questions about all the fundamentals that go on in school And that's where Hannity started quoting him when no start to ask in questions about all the fundamentals So when Mills asked is it teaching what are they reading he didn't mean literally he was using what's called a rhetorical device But you knew that Sean and you saw presented it as if the man had no clue what was going on in the schools You see why that's obnoxious and not just obnoxious but also dishonest and frankly stupid Let's do another one During one of his endearing liberal bashing jags handed these bits out They tell us that fuel burning SUVs are bad for America, but flag burning SOBs aren't While Sean fuel burning SUVs burn fuel and there are about 50 million of them they contributed to global warming and are dependence on our from countries like Saudi Arabia Which from the very terrorism you profess to be so upset about flag burning on the other hand is relatively rare And what's more Saudi Arabia does not produce American flags most of her complex are made in Taiwan a staunch ally Here's another ridiculous thing he says and keeping with his uncompromising stance against terrorism Hannity takes a tough principle stand against John Walker Lindy Merck and Taliban I'm with Hannity when he calls Linda Trader but we're either Earth's me as when he uses Linda to line an entire country No one man can represent an entire county no one man can represent an entire county less that county is climax county Montana Which doesn't need to have a single resident zero Wagner of county road one Here's Hannity named after John Lennon Johnlin was born in Marin County wealthy liberal suburb of San Francisco He grew up in a veritable ideological Disneyland of moral relativism political correctness and not to settle anti-American multiculturalism The kind that preaches that America is a racist sexist bigoted imperialistic homophobic and thus fundamentally evil and oppressive nation It's a wonder then Marin produced only one American Taliban and not thousands isn't it we're lucky Al-Qaeda didn't establish a training camp right there in San Salito Hannity keeps hacking away He grew up feeding his mind on the autobiography of Malcolm X not Moses or Peter Rappal and time Lynn converted from anything goes liberal agnosticism to hardcore Middle Eastern erratical Islam Before reading this I had never considered the rectline between liberal agnosticism and hardcore erratical Islam But Hannity has a strong case so many of my liberal agnostic women friends from college gradually relinquished their freedoms and decided to spend the rest of lives in Chadoras avoiding the gaze of men In contrast the Lindsey prey childhood environment Hannity trumpets his long island child and they protective embrace of the Catholic Church G nothing weird happened to kill little boys in the Catholic Church, Aishan nothing that would explain your bizarre fixation with our nation's homosexuals Throughout less freedom ring and the half-truths about tax policy and the problem about national security We find page upon page of denunciation of homosexuals homosexuality and homosexual practices including believe it or not on page 158 a graphic description of what he calls Fisting I am bonus father of since Felix need to has one Natasha and I no longer have to look for a motion square instead we listen to a new Rogers parent balance went to two hours How it's called an I don't know much All the two Christopher low a nothing like a horse down room with a stiff without a way Reckham Fisting Fisting Fisting Fibre bodice as its grace Fisting Fisting Fisting Fisting The way Forward Right Right Right Right Right Out Low Rusted Fisting Fisting The hell's the best for me?

Bill Clinton 42 Michael More 37 Jim Mandage 36 Oh, right Yours truly 27 How are Dean? What is that? 18 George Wish 14 Grovidale Six Tim Robbins won He just won on there No one jumpski don't have any Because like George A. Have no idea who the He said Pretty sad Anyway, getting back to Al-Frecken I've shown him a hand of the That obnoxious right wing piece of turt on Fox Now you left on on 50 Yes, I did How appropriate Speaking of affirmative experiences he says Hannity tells us about one of his great early inspirations On page 43 he outlines the life story of his embattled hero He's talking about how his champion was keyed into the gravity of the terrorist threat Even back in the 80s he says Alley North decorated for courage and bravery in Vietnam with a silver star The bronze star two purple hearts and three navy combination medals Help plan the Reagan administrations liberation of Granada He helped plan the rate against Libya And response to repeated rounds of Libyan terrorism He helped the president wage a relentless campaign for freedom and democracy in Central America And for his efforts, alley in his family We're not heralded as American heroes They were targeted first by Libyan terrorist and then by liberal democrats On page 263 tells the full story Alley North decorated for courage and bravery in Vietnam with a silver star The bronze star two purple hearts and three navy combination medals Was also keyed into the gravity of the terrorist threat He helped plan the Reagan administrations liberation of Granada He helped plan the rate against Libya And response to repeated rounds of Libyan terrorism He helped the Reagan Bush administration wage a relentless campaign for freedom and democracy in Central America And for his efforts, alley in his family we're not heralded as American heroes They were targeted first by Libyan terrorist physically and then by liberal democrats politically and legally From this I gleaned a couple of things First that Oliver North was decorated with a silver star The bronze star two purple hearts and three cotton navy combination medals Was involved in the military actions in Granada, Libyan throughout Central America And was targeted both by Libyan terrorist and by liberal democrats Secondly, the hand of the must have been paid by the word As I am, look for more on Oliver North's medals throughout this book Why exactly was North targeted by liberal democrats and moderate democrats and moderate republicans in the 80s? Was it for his bravery and courage which one of the silver star the bronze star two purple hearts and three navy combination medals? No, it was because he broke the law and led the line to Congress about it It was the Iran counterharing that first got handy if said about politics Like nothing before it he says the Iran counterharing struck a court of discontent urgency in me It was as if they were calling me to action You've got to wonder about a guy who's interested in politics was inspired by the illegal funding of terrorists Back to our book rating system the initial idea if your recall has been to separate the analysis into three categories Obnoxiousness why would any same person buy this book and lies? I now realize the humor so the support since there's so much overlap between these categories So far I've tried my best to maintain a laser-like focus on incredibly obnoxious material The way I've perforced looked into instances of naked dishonesty and strong reason to question the sanity of anyone who bought this thing Similarly, as I move into the lying section, I'll be unable to strictly adhere to the rigid boundaries of our initial model. I apologize like Arnold he apologizes Line number one Can't vouch your phrase examples of out your schools Or near our state education commissioner Mills noted that there's no simple fix for the problems of near our city school Handedly is found one and not just for New York but for every school in the country vouchers It's about competition and the government gives every student a voucher for tuition at the school of his or her choice public Private or perocule schools be forced to compete to resolve an education revolution You're going to see excellence in education because the parents are going to send their kids to schools Where there is discipline where there are no problems where their kids will get a good education And we'd see test scores grow through the roof explains sanity vouchers as Hannity will succeed because they'll break the nearly government A nearly total government obmanoply on K through 12 education this country the proof Hannity has described a couple of since discredited studies and then quotes an editorial saying that vouchers offer the only hope available To many poor students trapped in the worst schools now comes the lie one more proof as Hannity come right here in New York He then trumpets the miracle in East Harlem the fight for choice in public education Abluck the Chronicles a remarkable success during one of America's most troubled school districts What happened in Harlem a handful of teachers in principles and this before recognized a district we organized a district in the small independently Ronald turned their public schools to which neighborhood parents could choose to send their children the result Hannity puts it best Small innovative public schools having just a little more freedom than traditional public schools has paid such big Invalidable dividends of the lives of children their parents kids are learning in Harlem gives you hope doesn't it but not for vouchers because the miracle in East Harlem Didn't actually involve vouchers. There were no vouchers none nobody got a voucher vouchers not a part of the miracle Even though he offers it is proof that vouchers offer the only hope available Hannity carefully avoid saying whether or not the East Harlem program uses vouchers Suddenly he switches to the term school choice The artful avoidance of a literal untroup makes this especially sneaky kind of lie He's deliberately misleading his readers when you have to miss lead to make your arguments because you know you don't have a case To debate over vouchers isn't about school choice It's about whether I've heard money from public schools working fund programs like this one to private schools The Harlem stories about innovation within the public school system and specifically about the proven benefits of reducing the size of large schools The federal smaller learning communities program aims to replicate the miracle of East Harlem nation wide And it's 2003 budget however prison and push put the program on his list for termination Line number two the no growth 90s This is a simple one for some reason in the midst of making a point about something or odd on page 205 Hannity let this one rip Decades of liberal no growth policies have seriously endangered right economic and national security Here's a chance for you the reader to write your own joke. You might want to include a reference tile Clinton presided over the longest economic expansion in the history of the US I'm sure Hannity's publisher Harper Collins will get a kick out of seeing what you come up with Send your ripticular to an azad Harper Collins address in New York Line number three Through seven the crazy table During the first hundred ninety years of our great democracy's existence our government backed up $700 e9 billion in debt that might sound like a lot but during the eight years that Ronald Reagan occupied the White House He managed to nearly triple that number the day he left office our national debts through the two-point one nine trillion dollars That's a hard number to even comprehend if it helps picture a stack of twenty one hundred ninety one billion dollar bills Lot of money huh? It's a secret ten of the line right that Ronald Reagan did not cause the massive budget deficit of the eighties Republicans keep trying to find new and creative ways to disprove the truth of this one The Howard favorite is the old saw that his handedly puts it the deficits of the eighties were caused by the Insatiable spending demands of the congressional Democrats the prove at Kennedy pulls a table not out of his ass But out of his yes That is he takes the trouble of going on the arpenet well, I'm sorry. Thanks to go. It's the internet and downloading a chart from the Ronald Reagan home page Less do you think the Ronald Reagan home page is former president Reagan's actual official home page? You should know it's not It's the brainchild of Brett Kotman who's also the webmaster Brett Kotman's reality hammer a page featuring occasional essays defending the regular legacy Hannity plus the table directly from the web and prints it on page two twenty three of his book Hannity authors the table slightly he leaves out one key number which I'll discuss below The table proves or I should say proves or should I say does not prove the Congress caused the deficit by inflating Reagan spending Here's the table is Hannity presented and there he's got a printed in the book If this is confusing don't worry, it was meant to be stare at it for a while and particularly think about the column on the right Go ahead take a long look at it. How you doing? Perhaps it'll help to be descendants the Hannity uses to introduce the table in fact had all our Regans budgets been adopted federal spending would have been 25% less on a cumulative basis Let's parse that sentence It seems to say that how our Regans budgets been adopted federal spending would have been 25% less on a cumulative basis in fact That's exactly what it says What does that mean? Well, it seems to mean that if Congress had passed all of the budgets that Reagan had proposed then the government have a cumulative A cumulative of this spent 25% less money. That's a fair interpretation, right? And if true that means Congress was responsible for the Reagan era deficits now look at let's look at the totals section of the table What appears to be the total of Regans proposals or about two hundred million dollars less amount appears to be the total of Congress's budget busting appropriations Or if the table says in the average percent different section the difference is 2.8 percent For this this part here is just too too many numbers. I'm saying two complex to many numbers I mean he's all right See I want to say the table you have to take a look at it. What's up about my book and what the okay? Let me let me I'm just going to skip over that and go to Page was 101 I'm gonna say I'm not really happy about even reading the chapter that all teach me to let the audience influence we won't part of a book to read on here Why because as much as they did huh? I didn't know it had all these numbers. Yeah, I did but I mean just it doesn't work in the translation The chapter on the end colder and the one on Bill O'Reilly were great. This one quite frankly so far below So like I said don't let the audience influence ever again. Okay. It's 11 after one. How's let's say bushes in Britain? No, no, 10s of thousands of which we knew that there are tens of thousands maybe a hundred thousand people protesting They got their burning their candles and maybe their flags and yati adi and Michael Jackson's on the way to a never never seen again Another net life is sweet and how are they divided by it away as a bigger asshole than ever we got you mo okay We got you by the short hairs if you find that expression The brand these shoes in Pompano Beach is celebrating a big anniversary They're 25th anniversary this year 25 years.

Okay, there's only a couple pages left in this chapter. I apologize for the redness chapter because I got it It's not good. I mean the chapter's fine, but it's just not good for reading on the air doesn't translate Line number eight handed he makes it sound like it was the Democrats who were interested in investigating the cause that I'm level one actually was the Republicans Especially the White House who did everything it could have blocking independent probe into the massive intelligence failure No matter what ant culture may say 911 is no joking matter on that we can all agree After 911 I wanted to know what had gone wrong so did most Americans except handed he claims the Democrats in Congress He says that liberal Democrats at first or a little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure The Democrats with a bad guys handed in those who the good guys were Bush and his team he says made it clear that determining the causes of America's security failures and finding and remaining its weak points will be central to their mission He must have been referring to the October 6, 2001 New York Times article house votes for more spy aid and and to pull in reins of inquiry It said that Democrats are offered their own amendment continue to push for a commission that would examine the events leading up to 911 and the failure to stop the attacks No, I guess that can't be it But you know you can't trust in the York Times like you can trust the Washington Times I guess how did he must have been thinking of May 24th 2002 Bush rejects probe of 911 will knock you up sensitive terror papers wait Bush rejects that makes it sound like Bush was rejecting the probe instead of Democrats So maybe hey Hannity was talking about the May 20 of 2002 New York Times article Cheney rejects broader access to terror brief That article began vice president deftainy said that he would advise President Bush not to turn over to Congress the August intelligence briefing That warned that terrorists were interested in hijacking planes all that almost sounds like the opposite of Hannity's point Wait must be the October 21st 2002 Newsweek article Cheney investigators keep out now that doesn't sound too promising what about the first sentence Dick Cheney played a behind-the-scenes role last weekend he ran and agreement to create an independent commission Investigate the 911 attacks hmm, well, what about the article's license? There's just this general philosophical orientation that the less the world knows the better says one GOP staffer Of course the fact is the Bush administration thought an 911 commission every step of the way even though the families of the victims were begging for an independent probe from day one When political reality finally forced the Bush he's to give in Again Again So how you doing we go how's that total going? I don't know if Neil can hear us but we can't hear him I don't know if anybody's here on the street he cut off Do you just kept right on reading so I don't think he knows that he's off the air? I don't know why don't you go out and find out what's going on Hey, I'm back in the second time and when things like this happen I was wondering who's in the control room and who's an engineering and who's pulling plugs and Who's pulling wires and Neil if you're reading and hear me talk? That's because we can't hear you and and the beat goes on If you fire off some music here if I had any cute up and of course if I was smarter I'd have something ready other than the of course the fence red Philharmonies the dissolve with guns Don't forget to join the QA in vans and five seven to public's located at 411 South Cypress Creek Road in Pumpano Beach anything Anyone in the nearer huh nobody's an engineering nobody's an engineering nobody's an engineering courtesy in touch Nutton and according to the system one way there.
