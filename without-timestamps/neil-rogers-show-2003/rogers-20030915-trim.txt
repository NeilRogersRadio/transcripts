That would have been good. Okay, we got two polls today Or we're giving the result you had a good poll on Friday. It's about time. Well, thank you. I mean I thought was a good thing. I bet you got to make something of it. I see well, it's a good thing how about John Cox always done Cox. That was bad I mean the guy is I don't know we haven't seen him in a long time No, but no hard. He was about a pound ninety six and then he was on country kiss for about five or ten minutes And one thing about Cox is he used to call in the talk shows right Sometimes a little bit too late in the afternoon We know that he'd already been having a little party Yeah, a little party Yeah, you know But he was you know, he meant well, he I don't think there was an evil boom is body, you know? No, kind of hard to find him. I'm at all on that flat. Who was Thomas? I was a muffler's Thomas that he'd like ballooned up and he was in Georgia working Hmm, I'll be damned. Well, bad news Mike when you're not that long ago and Jerry wishner before that and now Don Cox Jerry Williams in between which of course Tom jick had to know about because he would know Jerry Williams from God damn Jovey and Jumama It's so sad that market. How come we have nobody there that knows anything about anything? We had a bunch on a heralds got the new look today. Still looks like a piece of crap to me God, what are what is ever going to happen anything going to change? Oh, same old crap So the reason I'm doing this pull is because you sent me that Harry from Kindle River to hell with South Miami ripping for Ellen ass So we'll find out we've taken this pull before when Mo was on before us So he sucked a big one like he always does What do you usually listen to before Neil show eight to ten a and this is pull number one pull number two We're gonna build and we don't have too much for it so far, which is good. We'll get to that What do you usually listen to before Neil show eight to ten a.m. Howard Stern Scott for Rale Ron and Paul NPR or music. Now the reason I put music on is because it covers pretty much anything else It could be music like on your CDs in a car or could be a music station which you're like while 100 or power 96 Or how 105 or audio on more radio romance yet a crap or party Yeah, it could be that All the way still think when the trend comes out you'll find that party radio is a way out That's my opinion. I'm like this The parties over hey Disney understand your real asshole. That's a rumor around the building so anyway That's the pull so far Howard's did I leave anything out of note? Not of note. I mean we could put like Haitian melodies, but that's still music. You know music is a catch all there for a because I don't want to put like a zillion different shows Because I think most of you waste a time anyway. Okay, here's George's pull results from Friday Here's what Lauderdale. Hello. Yeah, did you know that the Bob Center from the B.I.U. radio news director nod to who did Bob Sandler W.

I was choking him John Lennon for 120 to now see this again is a this is a generational thing sure Isn't it absolutely because JFK was assassinated the member twenty two nineteen sixty three So that's 40 years ago then they're closer getting close to that anniversary and of course when it gets to be an even number like that You know this year that make a big semis of them because it's 40 Right, right like in 1993 they make it a big semis because it was not a man. Yeah, and it'll be 40 this time John Lennon 422 what year was John Lennon and shot? Scott those leave it was 1980 I know I leave pretty close. I don't believe in ankl caraphe's close.

Some of John candy speaking of that John candy 150 too much candy John. He was great We love John candy. He's long since dead John Ritter 123 and that of course is a timing thing Fresh in your memory JFK junior 73 which we I'm revolted and nauseated by that There's no reason in the world anybody should be broken up about that John Wayne 60 Johnny cash 46 he's not walking the line no more In fact we wanted to fight out to it from John But he was in heaven or hell he said he's in purgatory because he's blocking that line John Wayne Casey 36.

Well, because it's a visual thing, they just had the music in the back So we don't have to wear a lot of bleep in the words Twenty seven votes on a poll, just one up on there On our first poll You usually listen to before Neil show eight to ten in a.m Scott for Rouse got ten, how do you like that? Harry in South Miami, Harry from hunger, whoever it is R, Scott for Rouse got ten, they love him, they want his ass Music seven, NPR six, Howard Spurms only got four, now that's A departure right, right from what used to be when we used to have the moment on That's a looting, oh, no horrible awful days And they're running Paul so far a big None, none, wait till they can't leave you like limp No, that's amazing, Ron and Paul got the big big old baby shot out When and that they got shot out, anyway, here's the fact that so bizarre They don't listen, you know, no, it's that they're like in denial It says in early August, I flew to Atlanta, I had to wait there for some other Relatives, I was then air at air-tram baggage claim and I saw a depressed Frontier looking feeble and sad sack guy, waiting there on a bench I sat next to the guy because I thought he looked familiar It was effing Don Cox with a power 96 T-shirt on, I think he lives in Atlanta now Well, I realized people talk in a presence about people who died He doesn't live in Atlanta, he just died like over the weekend, okay? Like I guess yesterday or this morning? Right, I thought he lives in Atlanta now even though he died So I guess he was a frontier in the old looking According to this guy, let's kind of cool, you know, the guy just died and I'll read the taken shots That's the South Florida, I think that's exactly what you'd expect isn't it? In South Florida? Guys just died I mean, he was well known, he was on a radio, I'm not saying he was like legendary Or something like that, although I guess in his time, maybe, huh? Sure, sunny fox, Don Cox, Greg Vidal, Jerry Williams, Alice Randtel Mr. Ego, Meg Green, right? Don Webb? What a wicked web we weave when we choose to be seen, that's why I told George Capre Let's time when he said he was, he was straight, but he wanted to do a gay entertainment show Huh? He was straight, sure he was He was, he was straight, but he wanted to do a gay show Anyway, here's the next poll we're going to be doing around probably a few minutes after 11 About 30 minutes He changed the poll on 1130 Or noon, I don't know how we feel like it because basically it's my show, we'll do it how we want Who's the coolest of them all? See, everybody uses that term cool and in regard to people, it's there at that many cool people anymore That's part of the problem Huh? I mean, like Baba, we used to have a present who a lot of us thought was pretty cool Yeah, he was cool He was cool Cool Which, wow, so here's the question, which well known person best defines the word cool And so far, between George and yours truly, we only came up with two names I did, I did a question, which I thought was a pretty good question is usual With no names on it Because I couldn't think of anybody It took me a long time to George, he put his thinking cap on His helmet cam on, which he's using right now on Playboy TV The helmet cam Johnny Dep He's cool In fact, Johnny Dep is not his hot and he's cool Based on that necklace episode That he popped out of his That's the coolest thing I ever heard of But it is Johnny Dep and I came up with Jack Nicholson I don't think anybody doesn't take the Jack Nicholson's cool Right? Right? So I think there's two good choices there, but we're going to have to have a lot of help from the audience to build that pull And we got plenty of time because we'll get to that later But in that feral, there's pull on away from the pack He's got 22 votes, got for a round baby Wait till that trend comes out on Thursday, man, you're going to see some We're going to have a trend on predicting right now I don't want to get muff and clearance all whipped up to a frenzy Terras might reach down and grab it briefly Grab it, grab it, grab for it Where it's supposed to be Grab that strap on his gun Roy! But I think Thursday you're going to see an astonishing trend I couldn't be wrong because of course it all depends on the fall out of the diaries and all the, you know All that stuff I think you're going to be amazed Now why you have Delray Beach on 9 Scott because you know Delray Beach, hello Hey Neil I'm sorry One more for that pull And the morning is Bob and Bob stuff Bob and Thomas, excellent, good choice, man, you got good taste Thank you very much, I'm glad you have a great day I told you it was a real coffee from Delray Beach Well it's only Monday, my second powers don't get tuned up to like Thursday Friday Later in the week You know what's he, we ever look up on John Lennon died?

Scott for around 45 NPR 22 Howard sperm 21 How are you moving up a little bit? But he's nowhere near Scott Music 17 Ron and Paul got a pair I guess I got hope Fake is what I heard And Bob and Tom have one probably got a call Bob and Tom are great by the way But they're just not really going to market No, this fact is very amusing to me In fact, I find this hysterically funny The one that you just sent me here that says Don't be modest, Neil, the coolest Neil God Rogers So I'll put that on there is kind of like a joke How about his coolest and elephant's fart? You'll win Yeah, right I'm telling you And I'm putting George on there too And I'll stop for real Why would you do that? Why not?

How could we let him on? What? But me? Oh my that that would be like seeing Neil is hip, you know? I may have a little hip problem now And a little hip pointer God But we'll put it on there just to keep these people used Here's a call from Halea, hello Hello, Neil Yes? I'd like to know what kind of man is hand-gober again too I beg your pardon? He's here and go Whoever's responsible for WQM's internet audio feature Be drawn in quarters in a public forum Says this fact that you sent me on Friday It's not air-assault because I'm trying to Excess the audio directly from QAM And can't listen to 90 seconds without the audio Cutting out for about two or three minutes Then it's back to the show for approximately Other 90 seconds then nothing Then back and over and over It's said we're all day long whether it's for RAL Or Hank or Mandage or you I think that Hank is into big manly man anyway But anyway But anyway So so what is the same? I can't get an egg and honest answer about the internet thing We get all these different stories What? Whether it really is working right or whether this is accurate About how it keeps cutting out I don't know It really is working wrong It's working wrong It's working away that the audience that listens on the internet doesn't like I see But I mean this sounds like a nightmare Can't listen to 90 seconds without the audio Cutting out for about two or three minutes And I mean what kind of a presentation is that? Probably a QAM presentation That's the real quick correct Now it was f-d up Is what we're trying to say By deal Well I'm a doer I'll find rub it in I'm getting a rub it in Yeah, but yeah I can't find finger on that button But you made it a lot of practice Because you never know when the big Was gonna pop up on that channel This is an idiotic facts which is why I read it I love these these are my favorite rights Gregory and Westboker rights Dear Neil I have a passport and I've probably been to as many countries as you Well what we do? And while I stay in Florida all summer I spend much of my time on my sales sale boat Well what we do again I've never missed a vote And I'm a national election since I turned 21 I'm 10 years younger than you Will be due three times, okay Gregory I've never voted Republican and national election Consider myself a social and economic liberal After listening to Mr. Dean's position on the middle Least during the debate a few nights ago I will not vote for him under any circumstances Even if he's the sole opponent of George W. Bush Not that you're one dimensional Gregory Do you understand that? He goes on the say to suggest that Israel and the Palestinians Are engaged in a morally equivalent struggle And that we shouldn't support Israel's security is a matter of foreign policy As both wrong morally and historically Dean has lost my support. He won't give my vote See what he said is we ought to have an even handed position there for going to be mediators for peace And up to one side it you can't be a mediator and like take one side Make any sense it's just common sense Gregory Which you're obviously lacking since you've so obsessed with your professional adjuism With your Zionism with whatever your insanity Just like all the other religious nuts So bug up Gregory okay, and I'm unimpressed by your resume. You're not you lose the job the aesthetic Now this was about to pull I did on Wednesday Hmm, in my Dutch friend I tell you about these Dutch what a bunch of hard-hearted bastards They are he mentioned it So he starts out sucking up to me of course He starts out by saying quote a Mark Henniel with his Dutch crap, you know And there's nothing worse than Dutch crap He says great poll This was the poll about the job you did filling it over the summertime Right And what you did you know you came up with more positive votes in negative They were pretty embarrassing I mean pretty significant number negatives He says great poll look at the numbers and you wander why this guy still does the summer fill in for you I wander wherever I can okay they call me the vonderer How many people listen to your show if you had the two categories together Offlane week it is 43% or not or hard-leless New Year's show anymore See the poll wasn't about whether listening any more it's about when George is filling in He wants to know what he's doing Peter Are all the Dutch guys named Peter you tell me Please show this to all you seen one Peter Please show this to the ad people who have spots on your show they must love it You're like Dave wants that protecting his quarterback with these sailing ears Although everybody knows he can't get us anywhere George is a great mommy spick but brings nothing to the table of the updates on the local swing clubs And looking at competition which of course Everybody's interested in that Put for a long for the summer and your hours that guy kicks ass on this station See what Amsterdam and the dark room of the it Do we says this professional instrument I'm not going to the it and I think you'll let the first two letters off Okay in the sill not case I'll still believe there you go another Dutch guy do we here's one that says this is from your this is your main man This guy wants to do you upside down inside out he'd like to insert things inside of you that are illegal in Amsterdam Teddy, Teddy and mine he's your number one groupie You can see the spat you must have you said it for me last Thursday You want to each it says I tried to get in yesterday in the phone lines too, but it was real busy anyway I wanted to remind you that George be the summer man I like to refer to George as a more contemporary straight and tone down version of the old man See there's your influence again influencing the audience with that old man crap while you lose the title anyway Absolutely, every time he's on I least bust the gut once a segment see this goes to show you that Teddy is an absolute and just a George George liquor He wants to clean out every cell every poor your body with his tongue because I mean is anybody ever said that you were funny Ever Ever who are you talking to you? Yeah, they have yeah, when was that? Lots of times I must miss those parts of the show But one thing we've always said is that George is entertaining. He's bright. He was a lot of cram ball But he's not funny But Teddy says every time he's on at least bust the gut once a set he thinks you're a panic man He thinks you're hysterical Too many doesn't have the best producer to fill in blanks like he does for you his timing is impeccable I didn't know that George had something going on the side if George had someone to throw the I'm listening at the right moment you would have a real threat on the other side of the glass I don't understand. I don't understand it. See he's so obsessed. He doesn't even understand how it works I mean if George wants to play I'm listening all he does is I'm listening press it himself See what you understand saying to busy looking George is by listening and taking out ass It says the three semis now sadly only a two-zam our rest and peace genre Out the last week You got to keep up. How come we don't have a bunch of calls about dot and codstein by the way?

I listen every day on the internet I use Windows media player with the 10 man equalizer and a cartridge in a per treat and find your audio among the best on the internet Oh, right. You're like that. How do you like that? It is very consistent with no dropouts whatsoever Good EQ and sounds better than your AM transmit, which isn't saying much When you go to the break we hear you do the live spot and the QAM bumper like Right then because you play those I do play those I firm off right here. Well, you know once in a while like the last time not you you're You know, you know Yeah, but once in a while. No, it's just like once in a while. I'm fumbling for something and I leave it there Like for example last break I had I'm listening but I've learned to like look up there Make sure that the letter Q is there so when I hit it it's the right thing. How do I want to say? Yes Like that I don't want to play the whole thing Then we'll hear the break scottle panic Anyway, go down to say I go silent till a break is over. We hit the music pit on the other end of the break Oh, it goes silent during the rest of the commercial break apparently Well, that's I don't know.

That's what we wanted to hear okay, excellent day Here's the facts from one of our chronic facts. Who's the reason that David Beckham is the soccer guy.

He got the free move right there now man. He's a way or whatever would rush to hear I mean, it's bad enough. We got dark guys with rostae here, but white guys would rush there.

Also, just to touch on something else, I was reading one of the articles on your web page about how pushes a poolerating or slipping. And there's some people who are saying, well, you know, we had a great plan for the war. I mean, come on. How could we not win that war the way we did?

I mean, I don't really care about him. I'm just so worn out with his crack. I say we just talk about him. Or at least maybe for next 5 or 10 minutes. Yeah, that's the current more term for next 5 or 10 minutes about the moment. They hate him. They hate your mouth. They don't want to take it personal like Greg V. Deldo's, but they hate you like poison. It was you would die. They wish you would have a new instead of John Ritter. They wish you would have been you instead of Johnny Cash. We wish you would have been you instead of Don Cox, who was at least a friend of ours. It kind of a bizarre way. He was okay. He was a good guy. He was a good guy. He meant well, he was like, well, kind of like a cartoon character. And he had his problems. Like we all do. You know, he wasn't perfect. And I'm like me in George. Right. Just, you know, he just abused himself for so many years in his body. Fine, I guess I mean, we're just, I don't know what the details were, but it was not a pretty end. Don Cox died in Kasia Tune in late. I checked the Sun Sentinel website. Now, see it. Because I know Tom Jick, a lesson's religiously in the short video while he's sitting there. Type it out.

Don't listen to him. It means penis. Tell him it means penis you moron. Verpipe founder Brian Vanderarch has been arguing with the band's manager Slappy Gold since 1996. These artistic types don't understand that sex sells. It doesn't mean penis. Of course it does. Put it together. What does verb mean? It means energy. Viga. And what's a pipe? A cylindrical object. A long shaft. If so, facto, you're going to long shaft that's full of viga. A f*** you'll have less mother f***er. Hey, you're off. Well, yeah, look. You're the one who said we should release those other singles to try and cash in on freshmen. As the argument escalated, Vanderarch tunted Slappy with his decision to release more singles. Each representing a different grade level. We were merely soft moars. We were merely juniors. We were underclass. All right, all right. So it didn't work. Her pipe still means a thunderous unbridled erection. Does not it? What you always bring up this? The verb pipe. Maybe the name means penis. Maybe it doesn't. It probably doesn't matter when you're dealing with f*** with sons of f*** like these. It's a big juicy shopping when like a chauvinist. Time. Time to hide them behind. 33 27 to load as 560 WDQAM.

It sounds like we can use some help because even on your hottest days, you never hit like 19 out of 20 races. No, well, close. No. Yeah. Like I said, even on your hottest days, when you were being honest, you were going to not that one. That's that victim that, uh, faculty, they had to have a movie about him.

Not Roger Waters. What does Roger Waters about as cool as a frog's fart man? Forget it. You got John Waters on there? We got it. But George, you know, and little know what all George knows everything. If you don't believe me, just ask him. It's cloudy and it's gray here in its dank.

NPR 50, that's George's choice because he's a suitable intellectual. Music 48, Bob and Tommy teen, Ron and Paul, I got seven out of 10 and 20 votes. What's the idea there? I thought we used to have like more of a crossover with them or not. But you did. And you know what it is? The people who used to settle for him are now listening to Scott. Right? Right? That's it. Sure. Looks like that. Looks like that for round mice. Do you wait till Thursday when those numbers come out? It is going to be amazing. It is going to be staring.

The greatest in the land. And everybody thinks they're great. But they feel the y'all. The blow bill, the number one. See what I mean. So just sing a little. When you say the blow, you put the hand here at the Buffalo Bells. Buffalo Bells. The greatest team in the history of the human race. The better. Buffalo Bells. The greatest team in the land. Since lies, bread and can't be it. Yeah, there you go. And you jazz up that redneck stuff. They listen to that banjo. Holy sweet God, listen to that. When you say Buffalo Bells, it don't sound so redneck. He do it. Everybody sing along now. How you bill fans? Here we go. Well, the Buffalo Bells are the best team. They have the best record over the last five years. And they went to the Super Bowl for a lot of times, which is more than I can say for this scum suck and finish. And they're a greatist. Because they meanly like their uniforms. They sure is hell. Be it the heck. Kind of having a fish on the helmet. Because they're not Buffalo Hall bills. The best football team. What I ever seen in the history of my life. They ought to Buffalo Bells. The Buffalo Bells. The whole gym, the Kelly, the greatest quarterback in the league. Yeah, everybody. That Buffalo Bells. They're the Buffalo Bells. And they've been around longer than the stinking rotten fish. Well, they're the Buffalo Bells. Buffalo Bells. What would you rather have as a pedophile or a fish? 14 till noon at 5.60. Nobody can. I'm fully in dear field. Right. I was in the aerosol. Friday night. They rocked. We had third row seats. Sounded great. He says, I remember a row force one. Thanks to that. We're good. Great seats. I won't point in the show. Steve was the coolest. I've met him a few times. Swung out over the crowd. When he went back to the stage, we had a swing right back over us. What? The girl I was with, the reared up and grabbed him. Well, when she got her hand back down, a piece of his hair was in his hands. A piece of his hair was in his hands. Where I think he means her hands. And somebody's hands. Right. It's a little clip-like thing. Guess just to make his hair look for. Has little beads and strings on it to show his red. She's got a piece of steamy tolerator hand. Also, as you'll period the list, he's totally cool. He's relaxed around his fans. Steve tolerate. Well, we can't put all the erosmith on her. Can we know? But we break. I can cure. Dianne and Fort Lauderdale, though, it kind of like peas in our parade a little bit. Yeah. We can get you. She says as much as you talk Scott for a lot, he simply will have manjack ripping off Howard Stern Show. Well, what's wrong with Wolfmanjack ripping off Howard Stern Show, huh? It says, for all this doing the same crap, Howard was doing 15 years ago, which it just must've been, et cetera. The numbers don't lie. Scott will never have Howard like numbers in the morning, so tell for a round of a joy or pull while it can. And by the way, I wouldn't be bragging about 34C as she's below average at best. Says Dianne. In Fort Lauderdale. Whoa. I think you like that. She's below something. Probably Dianne's hitting below the belt. Good old light. Oh. Oh. Anyway, five sandlers did what we got so much bad news. I have no idea who he was. But I've been only a good guy. Even though he worked for Chief Channel, he couldn't help it. He was never a WIWD when we were there. No. No. See, this is not right. This is by Thomas Monet of the Sun Channel. Seriously, if you wipe your ass with the newspapers in San Florida, it would be like an insult to your back home behind. It would be a grotesque. Don't do it. Because I wouldn't wipe my ass with the Sun Channel, especially because they put all this crap in it. It says he groomed young cast members and was a dedicated news editor and movie critic on his birthday show. But along with love for movies in theater, he's still found time to be a strong family man. Bob Sandler, a fixture at WIWD AM610 for 10 years. He died Saturday, a Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, complications from pneumonia. He was 60. He was diagnosed with lymphoma year ago, but he continued working at the radio station until September 4th that day before was admitted to the hospital, said Lori Shepherd WIWD news director. Well, at least we know Lori. She said Mr. Sandler had a great demeanor and provided training younger employees to help them hone their skills. She said the station staff was devastated by Mr. Sandler's death. Mr. Sandler originally from Brooklyn moved to South Florida 15 years ago, said very Epstein, a friend for 20 years. He said Mr. Sandler's media careers started soon after he got out of college and it is the news editing he said Mr. Sandler also wrote theater and film reviews for several South Florida publications, including entertainment news and weekly and Brown and the format of the United States. So, they were not said to the West's non-cuffs because we did no Bob Sandler. I think I know what they're thinking about with that 10 years thing. What is that? He was probably at wins for 10 years and remember they switched call letters and then wins became IOD. No. I'm just trying for him. No. I don't believe so. I don't know. Maybe Senator will clarify some real facts that and but he certainly was not a WIWD for 10 years. Not that I want to nitpick it makes no difference the guy passed away but the bottom line is if you're going to write some stuff put it right get it right just once in the South Florida newspapers and it was got to end fish wrapping pieces of crap. God. Can't stand it. Okay, here's the we got only a few minutes left on this poll and it's put it Diane. We'll get back to you. Diana. For us doing great with our audience. What do you usually listen to before Neil Shreweiter to name Scott for 137 Hours per 86 38% to like about 24%. NPR 57 music 54 Bob and Tom 19 they're great but they're in Palm Beach on a station that you can barely hear and date and brought and Ron and Paul got only 8361 votes only 8 in the Sun signs state and it's so great. No it's pathetic. It's week. It's week Ron and Paul. In other words when there's an alternative when there's a choice then the people are diving. You'll see in the next trend Ron and Paul. Zeta which used to be a great station when somebody I know was there. Oh God. Now is a piece of crap. I'm on poor says CNN practice self censorship. Listen very carefully. Okay. Sure. CNN's top war and it's also going to be on our website. Email the two Fed Erick. CNN's top war correspondent Christian Amman for says that the press muscled itself during the Iraq war and she says CNN was intimidated by the Bush administration and Fox news which put a climate of fear and self censorship. As criticism of the war and its aftermath intensifies, Amman poor joins a course of journalists and put it to charge that the media largely towed the Bush administration line covering the war and by doing so fail to aggressively question the motives behind the invasion. On last week's topic was a topic A with Tina Brown on CNBC Brown the former talk magazine editor asked comedian Al Franken a former Pentagon spoke with a mentor and I'm on poor if we in the media as much as the administration drank the cool aid when it came to the war. Set on on poor. I think the press was muscled and I think the press self muscled. I'm sorry to say but certain television and perhaps to a certain extent my station was intimidated by the administration and its foot soldiers at Fox news. It did in fact put a climate of fear and self censorship in my view in terms of the kind of broadcast work we did. Brown the next Alan Porter was any story during the war that she couldn't report. It's not a question of couldn't do it. It's a question of tone, Amman poor said. It's a question of being rigorous. It's really a question of really asking the questions. All of the entire body of politics in my view whether it's the administration, the intelligence, the journalists, whoever did not ask enough questions for instance about weapons of mass destruction. I mean it looks like this was disinformation at the highest levels. Clark called the disinformation charged categorically on true and headed my experience a little over two years of the Pentagon. I never saw the media holding back. I saw them reporting the good the bed and between. Fox news spokeswoman Irina Burgandi said about him for his comments given the choice it's better to be viewed as a foot soldier for Bush than a spokeswoman for Al Qaeda. CNN had no comment. How do you like that? I like that line. We thought with the one that is in other words you're either with us or against us. You comedy bitch you. How do you like that? How do you think old bitch more honest align that I would have expected from them? Wow. Oh, there's Ann Colter again. She's got her misdredger piece up. She's hopping on it. That big black one. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound. 60 on the AT&T. Well, his strap on you know he owns it two on a weekend. Got a chin strap. He made a place of mean chin volos what I'm hearing. Although I will say this I got that straight from the effud report. So thanks a lot, Miss Fudge. What are you usually listening to before Neil's show of Scott for 140? How are it's 389 NPR 58 music 54, bomb and time 20? Ryan and Paul are measly eight. Pretty measly compared to the beesley. By the way, Scott couldn't pay. No, I don't think you're ever going to pay. They're just jerking around. Start a catch out of that. Yeah. Here's Palm Middle Bay hello. Hey there. Neil's time. How are you doing sir? Okay. Number one, Sampler was doing pre-recorded movie reviews at the same time you were at IOD, at least on the weekend. I don't know. You know, I was during the week. Never heard of that possible. George never heard of mine ever heard of him. Now I believe it. Remember Larry Justice? Yes. He did pre-recorded movie reviews on his show on Saturday. That's why we never heard of him. That's why I never heard of him because Larry Justice was a dot-wing old man. The other one is on the more current poll. The name, I can't believe you've forgotten. The nearo. Robert DeNiro. Well, you know, there are people who think that he's a good actor, but off, you know, that he's not all like cool personally. I would agree. I'll put him on there. Okay, and finally, I have to agree with the facts that beat me to a laws on hold. Tyler is the sexy one, but Joe Perry is the cool one. Okay. Then my boat still goes with the narrow. Got it. Thanks a lot, pal. Ron, a foot Joe Perry on there. Sure. You do? Absolutely. What does that mean? Absolutely. I even asked you about aerosmith before we were like non-committal. We mentioned Joe Perry and all of a sudden, oh, absolutely. I was answering the phones. Yeah, right. Luckily, story. Watch me. Oh, yeah. I know that, in fact, Scott was, he was the topic of one of the aerosmiths. You're a baby. That's what we're always thinking of. Crazy. That's not. I thought you were going to play dude looks like a lady. I think if we just leave the audio from Playboy Channel on for four hours and we'll just have somebody handling the bleep button. All right. Me? And I'll just do the spots. And then we can just kind of lay out. Yeah. I'm sure. Easy. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

What are the scuzzles? Oh, I'm going to test stuff for some of you. For me, I don't really care because any of it. Yeah. This is Jennifer Lopez. I have to take my hormones every day to keep the hair from growing back on our minute post. And that's when I listen to the Neil Rathers 12 to one hour. You can fuse it. Lonely, drifting through life without direction. But I want to talk to you about an exciting career as an Episcopal Bishop. You see the flashy hat and robe are just the beginning. There's the glitz glamour plenty of TV coverage and a personally autographed 8 by 10 of our B firestein with every archdiocese. Commandments, manments. We think of the more is a suggestion. I mean 10 Commandments are 5. What if you can bat 300? It's fine with us. Catchings an option too. Or if you're into the sweet science of boxing, you can always beat the bishop. Now if you're thinking, hey, I'm not a piscobal, how can I be a bishop? Don't worry. We have two bishops that are Muslim. 5 A.F. And a Buddhist bishop that lets you rub his belly for good luck before you play bingo down at St. Latoya's. Join us. The few, the proud, the color coordinated at piscobal bishops. Travel to at 5.60 W.M. Happy Monday to a mad dog at two. The Humperate 4 from Shoolas. You got the Ricky Williams Show. Mr. What is he calling? I still remember, Ross did you a dreadlock something.

But above. Oh, then you got her a cool hotline 8 to 10. I missed that before. At Tony Romans would Joe's it might have waited. promo were playing the Joe Z doing at his St. The Recall play by play. So embarrassing that it's humiliating and degrading. We don't want to be associated with that. Any K follows her a cool hotline at 10 and join Mark overnight, leading into the Dodd-Ring Old Man. Here's the final results from the first poll today. What do you usually listen to before Neil show 8 to 10 in the A.M.? To your 94 votes. Scott for RL 152 38 and a half percent nice going sky. Oh. Howard sperm 95, 24 percent, NPR 63, music 55. Oh, oh. Five and time 21 and Ron and Paul only eight out of nearly 400 votes. Two percent. But that's pathetic. You know what? Perhiddy said. Huh?

Get with it. Cut the crap. This story is just a shocking for those of you who's been half today on your mobile which I don't. Maybe that's why I'm still alive. Mobile's make you see now. This is from the Brit independent newspaper. Mobile phones in their new wireless technology could cause a whole generation of today's teenagers to go see now that the prime of their lives new research suggests. Do you do that's funny? What? Do you think mobile was, uh, of course he's old enough. He don't need no cell phone. No. He don't need help. The study which warns specifically against the intense use of mobile phones by youngsters comes as research on their health effects is being scaled down to an industry pressure. It's likely that a galvanized concern about the almost universal exposure to microwaves and western countries by revealing a new way in which they may seriously damage health. Professor Leaf Salford, who head of the research at Sweden's prestigious lung universities, the voluntary exposure of the brain microwaves from handheld mobile phones is the, phones is the largest human biological experiment ever, and he's concerned that as new wireless technology spreads, people may drown in a sea of microwaves. How do you like that? I don't. What is this? What? Compare the factual aspects of this article with factual stim, the publication, uh, uh, it's long and convoluted. It's long and complicated. What do you think of the practice to me? Huh? Interesting. Okay, I'll put it about my very interesting, but for later on, Pao. The study, financed by the Swedish Council for Work Life Research and Published by the US Government's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, breaks new ground by looking at how levels of microwaves cause proteins to leak across the blood-brain barrier. They're leaking. Peabace concerns about mobile phones have concentrated on the possibility of the devices may heat the brain or cause cancer, but the heating is thought to be too minder to have an effect in hundreds of cancer studies have been inconclusive. Mays, Swiss Court, the scientific advisory to motor roll, told New Scientist magazine that governments and industries should stop wasting money by looking for help damage, but Professor Soffert and his team have spent 15 years investigating a different threat. Their previous studies proved radiation could open the blood-brain barrier, allowing a protein called albutumin to pass into the brain. Isn't that like an egg's albutumin? Don't know. Yes. Their latest work goes a step further by showing that the process is linked to serious brain damage. Professor Soffert said the long-term effects weren't proven that it was possible the neurons that were per themselves in time, but he said, neurons that would normally not become seen out until people reached their 60s may now do so that when they were like, BAP-GOOD MAN! And their 30s! How do you like that? Wow. So if you're on that cell phone, how can a Chinese baby put it back? Just like your foreskin, trim it back a little bit. Five little local fish, six fish, six little fish, three years old, yours is on the one cell phone. QAM! Eggrock! Eggrock! We've helped millions of men have a hard day tonight. And now we're going to have a good day tonight. By the way, it'll make you feel all right. Profit, you want to have a 50, how big you're putting? I didn't say anything. It sounded to me like you said, oh, that was just the end of the bed. It was like that. Maybe it was more like a scorch court like that. Speaking of that, priest and molested boy accused the new case I can't believe that you're in Cicola. An allegation of molesting a second boy's been leveled at a Roman Catholic priest who was in last month after meaning of the first allegation. Monsignor Richard Bowles, so Nick Ford was appreciated the diocese of St. Augustine, when the alleged instances of sexual misconduct for a place 32 and 34 years ago, he resized last month as pastor St. Mike's church in Pensacola, he's been unavailable for comment. St. Mike's. Monsignor Michael Mooney's spokesman for the diocese just goes to the second allegation late last week. We want to get the information out in case there's anyone else said Mooney, who previously had indicated the first allegation was an isolated case where we're a fact is to us underline that. And isolated case. Bowles and Augustine admitted he molested a boy in 1969, eight years after his ordination, the second allegation that Bowles molested another boy doing out of state trip in 1971 was reported last week Mooney said Mooney declined to come out on the details of the allegation. It's drawn from the recall election. There's another one, Los Angeles, retired priest faces molestation charges, months after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling voted 42 sex abuse allegations against him, a retired Roman Catholic priest faces new charges of molesting a boy doing a five year period in the 90s. The Reverend Michael Wempies 63 has been charged with five counts of child sex abuse. Wempie appeared Thursday in Superior Court didn't enter a plea, his agreement was postponed in Dolamar because one of his lawyers was unable to attend the hearing. Outside court attorney Donald Styer said Wempie vigorously advised these allegations and will plead innocent. Yadi, yadi, yadi. Court commissioner, Jeffrey Harkevy said Wempie's bail at 800 grandwarder of New Avoid contact with the alleged victim. Wempie was diabetic was being held in the hospital unit at the downtown jail in LA as lawyers said. And it goes on. They all go on. There's no endo. The beat goes on. The beat goes on. Go see the Magdalene sisters. You said it was not that great. You said it was okay. It was okay, but it's important. It's like Godfather 3. Oh yeah. But way better than that. Here's the fact that says before we get to our next Catholic priest story. I don't think you're a fan. It's his but Donald Trump should definitely be on your list. I'm not a fan, but do I have to be a fan of these people to put him on a list? Even though I did get the right one, Jack Nicholson obviously. He's got 27 votes. Johnny Depp 15. We got the top two.

I love this article by Jimmy Burstland, son or website that I'm going to read it. Good. With the elected or not. Well, you're like fascism and name of security writes Jimmy Burstland the yesterday's news day. To the Justice Department of John Ashcroft John McNick, and McNick is a lifelong criminal. He also is a Catholic and almost ever waste my time putting this on, but in matters with John Ashcroft, I believe that is some singing right-wing country road religion. Please, some want suspicious of Catholics if not more. The Irish Americans who come up dumb again, she's a Ashcroft. He harms their kind and they like him. The Irish even think the FBI is great. The Justice Department people hold a hammer for Irish immigrants, work and paying taxes doesn't count. Irish and taxes inflow to report detaining and deporting, the immigration people deny this, which means it's true. John McNick, 51, lived with his wife Francis and three children in peace since 1984 in Upper Derby, PA. He's applied for citizenship and has gone to the immigration office every few months to renew a work permit. His wife is a naturalized citizen and his children are citizens. The immigration people read British reports that McNick will, in Northern Ireland in 1970, two have been involved in shooting a policeman. Someone else was convicted, but the British said he must have been guilty. Any young man in those Northern Irish towns who wasn't the accept arrested by the British or Protestant police is more talking about. The British threw him into the maze prison. Don't worry about McNick only busted out of the place and got to Philadelphia, as he would not guilty in Northern Ireland he wrote on a visa application that he'd never been arrested immigration people's hearsay he lied. Since 1995 they have believed cheap British memos about McNick shooting cops. They were held off in the law courts for seven years, but when this ash crop came, it became ominous. An immigrant is like a parked car. He doesn't have to move to be in violation. A car can sit there and get tickets for a tag placed wrong, a faulty rear light, a front light, a mirror, anything. An immigrant can fill out papers and set questions for long hours, work hard for a year, show tax receipts, display papers of the three citizens and his family, and there are still 100 reasons in print for them to throw you out of the country. And if you get a Catholic from Ireland and an Ashcroft singing a song, the guy gets thrown out. They took Bernadette devil an out of line in Chicago where she was changing planes to go to New York for public speaking appearance and said her home. They said at 5-1 and in her 50s she was a threat to America. Then the of the day a band from Donacle was at the double an airport for a flight to New York to play a benefit in the Bronx for an old neighbor Mickey Duffy fighting cancer. Suddenly a mercenamigration officer appeared and told them they were barred from entering the US. The reason was a cheap technicality that only an Ashcroft agency could raise against Irish Catholics, the band went home, the patient's bills over here still mount. In the middle of July at 5-30 a.m. McNickle left his house as he always did for his union job as a sprinkler fitter, he gets outside his house he's jumped by four men and plain clothes who come out of the car. He begins to holler inside his house as old as sunshine 18 wakes up to the shouts. I thought he was in pain he said he ran out of the street in time to see the car driving away with his father in the back. McNickle was allowed to call his wife at 6-30 a.m. he was in the York P-80 tension center, it was allowed to see her for half an hour. I got talking to him she was saying on Friday night they had him in chains, here's a man who worked for eight years and used his own name and lived in the same place with his family, he worked every hour they gave him and they have him in chains. When she left they took McNickle out of the place deported him to Ireland without telling her. She was left with no income, she goes down a couple blocks to Patty Rooney's pub and coast lunche each day and Friday and enters the late. Of course it isn't enough. I don't know what to do she was saying on Friday. I'm fixing the house up with some union friends of my new husband of my husband. We have a new roof and a new bathroom, a new driveway. That should help the price if we have to sell. When she sells she goes to bleak doggo to put her family back together again. The two youngest children are there with the father. He gets them to school and looks for a job. They don't have a person getting his union wages if you took all of the doggo on shirk it upside down. That this American government of bigots from the low IQ state can mud over our bill of rights grabbing somebody with no warning in the dark hours is a terrorist act by some singers. The only way to defend yourself is to vote them out those who don't our fans of fascism. What a great column by Jimmy Presland in the holidays news day. Let me read the last paragraph again. That this American government of bigots from the low IQ states can run over our bill of rights grabbing somebody with no warning in the dark hours is a terrorist act by some singers. The only way to defend yourself is to vote them out those who don't our fans of fascism. Nice going Jimmy. How do you like that? I like it. Need to. Even Scott likes it.

That hole is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Back to him. As for Clarence said, I told him to stay off the beast. The Antarctic ozone hole is bigger than it ever has been at this time of the year. Threatening populated regions of South America, New Zealand, with harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation. Last year's hole was smaller than those recorded over the previous decade. Leading the hopes that they protected ozone layer and the upper atmosphere was beginning to recover from its destruction by man-made CFC chemicals. But early observations reported Friday to the British Association of Science Festival itself for the University show that the hole which appears every southern spring is returning with a vengeance. The findings suggest that reduction of CFCs will take longer than expected to benefit the ozone layer. Alan Roger runs the British Antarctic Survey ozone monitoring program. That's with two MZ and E program E. Said last year's smaller hole should be regarded as exception on clearly a one-off event. They have a meaning of one time event. It was nothing to do with any reduction in ozone depleting chemicals. The concentration of ozone destroying chemicals of the Earth's surface is fallen since 1994. Following international agreement to phase out CFCs in related compounds to the Montreal Protocol. The levels of the MZ fare lag behind the surface by several years. Dr. Roger said that probably near their peak. We predict that it'll be a decade or more before we can say unambiguously that the ozone hole is recovering. Assuming that the client ozone depleting chemicals continues to be same. How do you want that? The hole is getting bigger? And bigger? Pace on your stand up and there's slide right out right on the floor. 560560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. Here's a call from Pembroke Pines. Hello. Pembroke Pines. Going once. Here's Orlando. Hello.

Then the other voting systems used in California. So the conclusion that they have drawn is as that. As a result of that, there is unequal treatment, which is a violation of a 14th Amendment to the Constitution. How do you like that? Well, hanging Chad ballots, the caused the 2000th kind of regime Florida. They got the same problem and some of the counties in California. The candidates will continue their campaigning, whether they will revise it somewhat. Governor Gray Davis has already put out a statement saying for the moment he's going to continue his campaign as if the recall is going forward. Of course, as we found out seven days is an eternity. Oftentimes seven days means nothing in the glacial pace of the judicial system. But in this particular case, there's some obvious urgency and it's just a question of where the appeal lands. All right, a Bob Frank. I'd like to add a little. Do you think it's odd? Yeah, good luck, Toronto. Sounds like it might need it. 19 till 2 at 5. 60 WKAM.

They're feeding the water, they're hands on their marbles and blapings and had past 4. They're came a young lady. She looked like a pretty young creature. She sat on the grass. She pulled up her dress and she showed them her ripples and laces and white-floppy done. She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spin. While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling, Reptucing litter from yesterday's hunch. While the girl in the middle was rubbing her eyes at the pillow, Down by the dark, he looked like a man with a size of bull home in the country with a big fence out front. If he asked her phone like they she'd show him her little pet dog who was subject to fit. And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender hands with a movement so quick. And then she'd bend over and suck down his candy so tasty made of butter, And then he's spread whipped cream all over her cookies that she had left out on her shelf. If you think this is dirty, you can go to yourself. 147 at 560WQM here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Niel. Yes, ma'am. How are you today? I'm doing great.

A federal appeals court has blocked the October 7th, California, Recall. By the way, I have a little lunch. All right. I don't have a. We're. Mm-hmm. No, not John weiner. All right. What a grotesque thought that is. So you want to go about clearance. He not only is he like a unit, but he hangs out with people of similar. Although John weiner was married. I don't know. Well, think to what. A federal appeals court has blocked the October 7th, California, Recall. But state is order for seven days to allow an appeal. The ruling from the 9th, US Circuit Court of Appeals follows a hearing last week in which the ACU sought a post-bumb of the vote. The ACU argued that election officials stood up more time replace antiquated voting machines in several California counties. If Monday's ruling stands, the recall vote will be moved to March of 2004. How do you like that? Peter Reggone. A spokesman for the California governor. I did a great Davis campaign. Said the governor in his campaign will keep moving forward till it's settled. It's in the court's hands. Regggone said, we'd be pleased by anything that tends to be greater in a franchisement of the state of California, California. Got a yati. And LA Times pool published on Friday, well we know this is on our website. Showed that the support for the recall is down to 50% 47% saying they would vote to keep Davis. I mean, it's like razor thin margin. I think he's going to keep his ass in or how do you like that? Great. To which say anything to subvert the will of the right wing lunatics, or I try to follow the electorate by stealing election after election, flow right da, California, etc. And so on. It's called dictatorship is what it's called. Like Jimmy Greslin said, fascism. What's the Arnold going to say? Hello. Yeah, what? He's going to come to three real quick. Here's Miami. Hello. Georgia the Fag. Okay. Great. Georgia the Fag. You're an asshole. Tell us something we don't know. Okay. Schmuck. The whisperer again. We're going to find his ass. And destroy it.
