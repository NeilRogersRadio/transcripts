Have a nice weekend everybody. Good morning Neil. Moran Scott. You know, I'm picking on them for a pedophile priest again. Yeah, next week I'm going to do the Jews and Catholics. Good. I mean the Puerto Ricans. I mean the Cuba. I mean the anyway. Okay, we're spending those pedophile hot seed demands. I have a way happy New Year. Happy June, a jiu-yar. Yeah, thank you very much Neil. And you know, I'm actually, I have Billy the Mylin in here today. We were doing a national story for Tomiles. Joe Buck, Tim McArbor, Brokass, and they told me that it was going to be 15 seconds. Yeah. That's better than nerd. Well, that's what you get. You see, don't go to it for a moment. That's what I did see that. I know it's a people were there to see it at the Skydonk. Yeah, I did not want to. I did not get in the pouring rain here. It was pouring at the Maros game. 30 minutes. There's a thousand people. And I was going guys. They let's say they went from 25 to 28. And then I had a party. There was 32. And it's stupid as a Jim Sarniman. What a whizzling here. He said that I'm fabulous. No, he did suck your ass. But he about the old the sports hall coast ripping their crowd. Well, of course, we ripped him in this business about while they had television ratings were so great. Yeah. So that's for free. That doesn't mean supporting your team is sitting on your fan ass and watching it on TV. Yeah. Well, see if he had Sarniman, of course, he should know about a fan ass. Do you know what I say? Scott Ferrell's just a jam minute on sports day. It's a must see minute every Monday night. Well, the funny thing is is that, you know, no one goes to the games as you've been right all along. Here's the thing that I wonder. Today to play out tickets going to 10 I guarantee you though I've known for your crowds for the two playoff games. They might have 10,000 more people. But they don't even top 40. Do you really believe that? They won't top 40. You don't think they'll sell them out? No. Oh, it's like Pittsburgh men, no one cares. People in Pittsburgh are trying to get a job because the George Bush no one has a job. And you don't go to baseball games when you're broke. You know, but what about my own copies got a job? I think he works for the Catholic priest that chase little alter boys, right? Little birdie told me. Don't be knocking as a lot of Catholics in Pittsburgh and say Lewis manners. Nothing but Catholics. Who choose a lot of things? They lose and all the Catholics. Yeah. It's a hundred and ten all summer and then they get nine months of snow. Yeah, they got almost as many sources and say Lewis isn't Atlanta. Yeah. Then it's still trying to sell people on that stupid arch. And then money, Mr. Sippy, Christ, if you drank out of that, you'd be dead and fine. No, miserable whole. Look what it did to Jack buck. I made an account. She combined care the city in St. Louis and make one real town instead of two little ones. How about my main Jacksonville sounds good? Jacksonville's a horn. Everything in between. And then everything in between is my horn. And Tampa. So what was this about the, who's it that's got the sneaky hole? I think Howard's wife. Was it the, was it the reiner, Philis or he's the reiner? He's the reiner. He's the reiner. He covers her body with a raincoat and I said, well, what's the difference between that and Philis's hole? I think he gave us a good hole. I mean, Paul, I did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I mean, he's got the sneaky as told. He's okay when Howard talks bad about us all day on the air or behind our backs. So I'm just meaner. Are you going to do a few more? Are you going to do a few more? Are you going to do a few more? Are you going to do a few more? Are you going to do a few more? You hate everybody. Hey, when it comes to me, he was stuck in my ass this morning. Many cities going to take me to the zoo. He doesn't realize they won't let him to the zoo. Yeah, because he likes the blow pan. A Tony, four in Tino is the new thing. We see you. I want to leave. Tini, the heat higher, twenty-four in Tino. You know him? Can you see Moa with the zoo with that thing on his head? I can see. Barley creature in there would be like cozying up to whatever that thing. I heard Moa like that, sex with kangaroos. Yeah. I'd like to see that. I'd like to see him hopping on it. I know he downloads porn in here on Q&A. You see a Robert Palmer died. Oh, that's simply irresistible. He was addicted, man. I think he was just like the guy that died last week. He was a doctor from age simple rules for doing my daughter in the ass. John Ritter, they're both too young to die. It was Palmer. He was the worst thing today, man. You really must be getting ready for a big, black dome weekend. I haven't had a cable this morning. And you know, I like to sit on cable beach. He might be as if I'd played for a space last night. Yeah. Your body, Bob Murphy, they haven't sent that for him with 10,000. Was he getting a lion drive? Did he get a lion drive for Bob Murphy to call? Bob Murphy's the perfect man. He's a crap buddy. He's awful, just horrible. And I also noticed that your buddy Jim Sarny, that retard he has suckless his names, but they're too adive van boring. Hey, this is Ashley's. Yeah, we've already done him. How about Monday? Miami here. They're doing a feature on yours. Truly, you'll enjoy that piece. Well, you're all over the place, man. You're like cancer. You're everywhere. All I'm trying to do is help the Neil Rogers show get bigger. I'm just here to help the real show. Ten to two. I'm just a pre-lum. I'm like a warm-up. I'm like a wet dream. I'm maybe wondering if it's good. Thank you very much. We can move forward. Hey, we can't. You know, I got a free car and a free Oscar. Come at your car, Matt. Did you get a car?

Do your lovely wife for the next hour. Because the, and did you see in the presidential debate yesterday? I saw none of it. I thought you said you peruse the couple minutes of it. No, that may. I saw a few songs. I like afterwards. Few seconds. I was pretty, I was pretty. See, the sad part about that whole thing is that every time I see one of those, the people who make the most sense that are the most impressive are either people are can't stand like Al Sharpton or people who have no chance like Dennis Gassinich, who both were outstanding, but they have no chance. I'm Graham was, you know, in his usual boring way, but he was very good but has no chance. Right. Anyway, if the presidential election was held today with these candidates, would you vote for it? And to that we didn't, I didn't say that one from yesterday with a Wesley Clark who just kicked ass. He had about 70% right. Maybe Eric will fax there. I like email me the result from yesterday, so I have it. Because the tech Kennedy beat the pants off bush on Wednesday, then yesterday, Wesley Clark just absolutely just stung him big time. big time and now that they were going to do Howard Dean against George W. will per him up. If the less word today who do you vote for with these candidates Howard Dean, George W. Bush or I wouldn't vote, that's the first poll today. Got it? Got it. Okay, good. Or here's the facts that says. Remind the audience that Chicken Hawk Rush Limbaugh's a draft manager. Hey, audience, Chicken Hawk, our Rush Limbaugh's a draft manager. His excuse was a system is but it's a... Correctum. You can meet all about it. If you Google draft Rush Limbaugh, regards e-vennis, PS love to show. Thank you e-d. That was at any dinner, or maybe we can do George Dennis it. So we're down. I know it's done if it wasn't. And then, hearing it through the raceway. Anyway, here's the results from yesterday's poll. This was, uh, marginally interesting. I thought it was, what's your biggest gross out we asked? What does turns you off and makes you want to puke your guts out? Body odor 285. Can't stand it. Bad breath 126. And I'll say it again to people with the worst breath of the ones that always when they talk to you want to get up real close. I think they know they have bad breath. It smells even worse than Philips' hole. I wanted this. God says that the most wife has the Sticky's toll and focus, have it he said. What? Bad breath 126. Jelly rolls of fat.

So they all zeroed in on him and ganged up on his ass and he's got 27 votes out of the first 34. But I was fast. Why? Holy. I went up on it. It's 30 votes already. He's got 27 of them and W is only got four. Nice going Howard Dean. That's my man. For sure. I hope Wesley Clark doesn't. I mean if Wesley Clark gets it no problem. He will go step right behind him on March right along. But Howard Dean's the man. He's got a big pair. He's not one of these waffers one they see and one thing. He's forward. He's again at heat they are. He didn't meet that. That's why they will pick it. No. 10th. 14 is five 60 WQM. It's the 2003 New Rogers blowout cell continuing. It's the in progress.

Comey, Pinko, go to be deported immediately with not sooner. 74 votes on air already. If the election were right now, who'd you vote for? Howard Dean 57. I wouldn't vote 10. George W. Bush only 7. Oh man. Eric, you're the best man. Eric immediately emailed me to result from yesterday's pool. Although I don't have the percentages. You can do it. Oh, I could do it but I'm not going to do it though that quick. Because it's not an even number. Anyway, 280 votes yesterday. Well, on Wednesday, 10 candidate got 52.3%. Wouldn't vote 24.4% in George W. 23.2%. Out of 266 votes. Yesterday, we wound up with 280 votes. Wesley Clark 195. George W. 45 wouldn't vote 40. So Wesley Clark did considerably better than Teddy. But then again, Wesley Clark didn't kill anybody. Well, not by accident anyway. And today, so far out of the first 74 votes, Howard Dean's got 57.77%. Wouldn't vote 13.5% in George W. As measly seven votes representally 9.4%. Here's a fact that says, besides Robert Tommer dying. Here are a couple of other famous names. Remember of Lee Marvin's duty doesn't. Tom Busby, Canadian activist known for his role as Milo Vladik in the duty doesn't also appear at Canadian TV. And it films like The War Love and Heavenly Pursuits. Kind of a heart attack September 20 and Glasgow Scotland aged 67. Remember him? No. I remember Jim Busby used to play centerfield for the Washington Senators. I remember Ruth Busby. And Bernard Manishevitz. Oh no. Oh my god, not Erica Rushshara. Really? Not V Manishevitz. Bernard Manishevitz, president and owner of the kosher foods company, V Manishevitz. Oh, we can say is, which was founded by his grandpa 1988 in his known for its wine and mutsa. And who became the last generation to earn a company as he sold to investors in 1991. Not one. That September 20th of a heart problem heart disease in Verona, New Jersey age 89. And it says, oh, V is what it says here. V. Or V. He's dead today. Wow, they're dropper like flies man. Just watch it. Everybody be extra careful these days. We don't want you to get nervous or anything like that. But they're droppin' like flies. So Robert Palmer's the dad of a heart attack. Yeah, or is it in Paris? On a wonder. Yeah, probably it's some of that heavy French food. Don't you think? At least the ability to send a picture of Phyllis's hole. Rocks in your Robert Palmer known for his sharp suits and his hits include including addicted to love, died Friday in Paris of a heart attack as Manishevitz said he was 54. Nobody did like Robert Palmer. I mean, not everybody thought he was all that great, but I mean, nobody didn't like him. Just fine. Hey, who's fine? Palmer was on a tube day break in Paris following a television recording session in Britain, his manager, Mick Carter said from the French capital. In the 1980s, Palmer became a superstar with singles which also included simply irresistible, accompanied by slick videos featuring these smartly dressed Palmer with a backup band of attractive women all in black outfits and glossy makeup. A side project, Power Station formed an 85-a-John Taylor and Andy Taylor of the 80s super group Durand Durand Square 3 Westopton hits including communication and ginnidon. The son of a British naval officer Palmer was a member of several British rock bands before he hit the big times of the solar artist he lived in Switzerland the past 16 years. I'll be damned, Spights. I know idea. What do you like better Spights or Shwarts? Known for his GQ sense of style Palmer was named Best Rest Mail Artist by Rolling Stone in 1990. The addicted to love video with its mini-screened model strumming guitars as Palmer sang, became one of MTV's most played clips in Spark Pro Test from some feminist. Well screw them, okay? You nasty, smartly bitches with your smelly hole. God, that's pathetic. Well, what's the big deal with that? Oh, is that not gonna? Huh? It was sexist, don't you know. I'm not gonna attach in a proper significance to it because at the time of nothing, I just have to become an iconic look Palmer once out of the video. Get his first hit album in single sneak in Sally through the alley in 1974. What was it doing Sally in the alley? Yeah, the back alley. In his 20s Palmer worked with the number of small-time bands including Da Da, Vinn Grigio and the Alan Bone band, Boun, B-O-W-N, how do you say that? Boun? Sure what, Boun? Occasionally appearing at opening acts for big draws including the Who In Jimmy Hendrix. Palmer once confessed he wasn't attracted to the excesses of Rock and Rolls start him. I love the music, but the excesses of Rock and Roll never really appealed to me at all. He said I couldn't see the point of getting up in front of a lot of people when you weren't in control of your wits. It was noted for dressing up and being somewhat restrained. I don't want to be heavy. He said an interview with the Rolling Stone magazine. I don't want to be heavy. He's not heavy. I don't either. He's my brother. I can't think of another and that was who did that. He's the hooting that. The hollies. The hot, very good. That was excellent. It was the hot. I was just thinking of the yellow label. That's sad. I don't know. I was just thinking of the yellow label on the 45. I can't think of another attitude to have to annoy inst in a hopeful and positive one. He said that that includes such unfashionable things as sentimentality. Well, I can afford it said the late Robert Palmer, who's dead. Damn it. The good people are dead people. The bastards did live forever. They just live on. I just like my father. Live till 90 miserable, rotten, bastard. Cold as ice. Right? Speaking of foreigner. I will get to the main pole of the day other than the Beatles of the Stones who's your all-time favorite rock group. Now that was inspired. What inspired me of that? Yeah, somebody said something. Oh. Oh, no, it was about to foreigner thing the other day. Right. That call we had and I couldn't understand what the guy was saying. That's right because he was a foreigner. Well, like everybody in South Florida, if you're not a foreigner, you ain't Schmidt. Did my suesian those bumpers, did his urmaine a foreigner, you ain't Schmidt? Anyway, I got a short list of six years so far. That was Smith foreigner, EL. Oh. Doris Beach Boys and Eagles, is my short list so far? I had it to the cards. You had it to cards? I love E-elos. They're not my favorite as you know. I like it too. I don't want to admit that. Yeah, George Washington too, but it's not mandatory for me. All I call set-home stuff. Yeah, what does that be going on? I think he said he did Sally and the alley. A lot of people doing Sally and the alley. So anyway, what was that about Phyllis's hole? What did you say after Beach Boys? I said Eagles and the cards. Okay. Aerospace foreigner, EL. Oh, this pulling going to go for a while. Okay, meantime, the votes are pouring in on a presidential poll. They're pouring, man. 110 votes and Howard Dean's got 84. 76.3% W is got 13. I wouldn't vote 13. Lemon. 0.8% reach side by each.

Oh, I'm just writing to take it off. You're a fake. There's a bulletin for you. I'm a fake. I think only fags like Metallica. I'm sure they told me that up front. Yeah. Don't you think only fags are in the Metallica? Really tough. Good. It's a good cover. 560, pound, five, 60 on the AT&T. What is it with South Florida? They're like, surely they're good. I'm ready for them. I don't care. Bring it on. 560, pound, five, 60 on the AT&T. You're a fake. Yeah. Well, congratulations to me. I'm pretty proud of it myself. Here's a four-later nail, hello. Come on. Maybe this is somebody in a better frame of mind. Yes, sir. But we've better hoat that boat. Come on. Come on. Yes. My name's Ert. And I saw that the mom and her holiday blonde. The NFL wow, Kurt. The NFL. We're going to have to not in the NFL. So get lost. Start your old fart. All right. Go cover the sports show. It was okay. Didn't I tell you to put any hundred year old, although that was good. I'm glad. Nice. Which you like me to screen him again? No, no, no. I love that was good. That was excellent. The Marlins of Auburni won the NFL wild card. The only problem is they're not in the NFL. They're the national baseball league. But that's okay. I hope you have a good ball movement this weekend. Art. You old fart. Go start. Take him away. In a card. Now we love art till death to us. Hey, speaking of that moment of salute. I suck in my ass this morning. Have he do the unashrucked. Believe it. This new friend, the arrogate. I'm going to take him to the zoo because you or I'm like, he's like my grandfather. Guilty had a good life. He says well, which one is really the grandfather? He will fart. That was good. Nice going, Guilty. Of course, Guilty. You know, he goes whichever way to win blows. That's the way. That's a really easy way to solve that whole. He's like a read in the wind. Think. Speaking of read, how what thing is that? Who's older thing? Oh. Just plop your driver's license is down. Up that he would. But now you already know my birthday was November 5th. I know you already know the story. No exactly. Hold on almost 61. I'm an old fart. I'm not going to lie about my age. I will. When I come there, I'll be more than delighted to put my driver's license aside by each with his. The only problem is now you're given him plenty of time to get a phone. Yeah. Oh, yeah. How good are more of those places where all the kids go to get phone ID. You know, only in his case. To usually old for it's okay. But in his case, he's still doing it. Am I right? I knew you'd do it. That's why I'll be not going to post personal money. More Howard David. Now that we're bonding, we have this tremendous tight friendship, man. Tight. Not as tight as fill as. Here's North Miami. Hello. Yes sir. We. How do thanks for calling lady a little medley of Shane. This is what he is who that was. So, talking to a tin can. Why didn't realize that it was going to be chronic hysterical Friday. This is great. I didn't get the memo either. Oh, my God. We must have missed that. They must have passed it right on by us. The memo. This is chronic obnoxious hysterical Friday to which we say. Oh, right. Yeah. I like it. 172 votes. Now let's see. We got to be 280 that we did yesterday for the actual number. We won't do it because Friday for some reason is. I don't know. What is it about Fridays? I don't see Mondays. Mondays and Friday. It's just suck. Monday to the weekend. The week. Never. And then Friday. I've never been able to figure it out. Maybe we can offer to week in every. There. They're bailing. School and off. 179 votes. 11.1% 20. So I wouldn't vote. 28. They vote for George W. They 15.6%. And Howard Dean. He demand 131. 73.1% for president Dean. And local. This is for three. And he's a teacher. And when he's a lawyer. And baby. Come play with these two. She's a perfect Nazi. Who likes the flasher fancy. When she's going to go down. She's hanging like the straw. Me on right. And cultless rancids. And cultless rancids. Snatch. Imagine what you can catch. From in cold first snatch. Not a rea. Scratches with a brush. She'd bang the roll though. And ill march. You'll never get thrudge. And cultless rancids. Snatch. And cultless rancids. Snatch. A swirl of the pool of crap. And cultless rancids. Snatch. And puns your noise. You're leaking out her voice. You're walking with the deal of dough. And then you're going to be on that whole pool that we take next time. Oh, I'm going to stick about that. But you're too tall. Oh, and speaking of that. I think I know who else could probably beat bush hands down his pants. I know. You think of when. Yeah. I'm not right. Uh, 24 oats already. Howard Dean's got 148 of them. 72.5 percent. W's got 32.15.6 percent. I wouldn't vote. 24 11.7 percent. I think about 10 percent out there. Wouldn't vote no matter what. Right. Right. At least. Like. Like that. Asoles. Not that voting is usually worthwhile. But in this particular case next year it's going to be mandatory. You got your choice. You need to like goose step or like run. 5.670560 pound five 60 got some bad news by the way before we take any more calls. Bad news. What? Another hangup for do not call just when we talked to Congress was with that overwhelming suckest and you had the wrong numbers by the way. The house voted 412 to 8th and the set of voted 95 to 0. I don't give a crap. They changed their vote. For a curse one page will authorize in the if they see do not call his butt. And of course I'll present his just anxious foaming at the mouth of sign that but. Minutes after both houses of Congress concluded a remarkable scramble yesterday to make a popular do not call registry pass muster with a federal judge. A second judge ruled that the program had deeper problems. It violated the telemarketers first amendment rights. Oh brother. And because of the fact that the telemarketers are panicking the word I get from my house down there is like now it's 10 calls a day. They're foaming at the mouth to try to get all of their calls before the deadline. The ruling by U.S. District judge Edward Nottingham and Denver headed the telemarketing industry at second legal victory this week and put in doubt the future of FTC's national registry. Although Nottingham's ruling is certain to be appeal league-like spritz said it at the very least it would delay implementation of the program which was supposed to start next Wednesday was supposed to start. The judge ruled that the registry violated the free speech rights to telemarketers because it barred them but not charities posters or political campaigns for making unsolicited calls. More than 50 million phone numbers have been registered on list to be off limits to most telemarketers. Noting that popularity the head of the nation's largest direct marketing group asked its five thousand members not to call anybody on the list regardless of its legal fate. We're not looking to ignore the wishes of consumers said direct marketing association president H. Robert Weinson. I'm wondering if the because it doesn't really say. Tarradies I guess it's not going to stop the cops from calling you know which is always very intimidating. I'm calling for the fraternal order of police and we want your money you know and we have your number we know where you live. Uh-huh. Yeah, not that it's intimidating or anything like that. But I just mentioned it. So now this is in limbo again. It's in limbo once again. Just when we thought we had a little bit of freedom we had a little privacy at our homes that people are going to like terrorize us and our goddamn phones. And no, here's another goddamn judges is oh well, I can't violate their right of free speech. I thought there was such a thing as like you know you're right to privacy and your own goddamn home and like peace of mind all of these things. Right not to be bothered. Right not to be bothered by a bunch of grave robbers pedaling cramp. I rather have Ron Popeil call, you know, at least that would be fun. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Please tell us about your greatest adventure. You do this. I actually do like once every year. It's the time you had a day with that chick at Michigan State when you got drunk. Nah, I get out of here. It's so boring. Yeah, I get a life man. Get something new. Oh, I don't like old and stale. It's meld old and stales matter fact. Yeah, that's so boring. What is wrong with these people today, huh? Man, oh man. I think we're like way ahead of them things are going a little bit too good. They can't handle prosperity and stuff. They don't like that. They like misery. They love it. They thrive on it. They pray for it. 56060 what other than the Beatles are the stones, you're all time favorite rock group. The runners. You're a cold as ice. Yeah, four years on it. And also, I'm just going to play E. L.O. All the right. I love you a lot. Spiriting these calls were getting so far. They suck. Oh man. This could be the best song that was ever made, you know? You don't think? There's an yellow song I like better, but I like this a lot. It's one of them. Yes. It's right in there. I don't want to step on it, but I think I'm going to anyone. Is that no idea? How do you talk this thing up, you know? It's coming around. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's coming. Okay. Have you been alright? Yes. Oh, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly. That's a loony. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm just going to play E. A little E. L. All the other. I got one. Asked about it yesterday. The one found it today. They never played this one already. Much. If I wasn't in confusion. Confusion? Yeah. It's confusing. Anyway, as we added McTalk on it, and we're probably going through another 85 or 90 more calls. Then we'll get somebody else that's got one. That's good. As opposed to just a list of a lawn-reelist of names. You know, nobody wants to hear that. It's boring. Maybe I'll even tell you that story again about our lean and the grass or Michigan State. What do you think? No. What's wrong with it? It tells the story about when you poop your pants. No. Oh, I like this a lot. Yeah. Oh. Like I said, that could be the best song ever done. Which we'll simple about the dos. I couldn't watch. Anyway, sitting there on air, we'll add some more names on that group. We got plenty of time. Like about the eight minutes before we get started. And then once we get it started, it's going to be air scots, a very important business. Take care of the day, right? I think he's getting a little update. It just might be a bit more updated than we now. But he gets around because he's got some more important money making things. This is like small potatoes. 241 votes, not too bad on our presidential poll today. I think we're going to beat that to 80 that we hate yesterday. If he acts me, in fact, I'm refreshing it now. It's 245. If the election were right now two days, and these were the choices for whom would you be Houghton. Howard Dean 176 nearly 72 percent. George W. Bush 40 16.3 percent. I wouldn't vote 29, which is nearly. That's 11.8 percent. The first 245. Robert Palmer's dead by the way. That's the bad news. Good news is, Marlins, one last night. They got at least a little get and they got it. All they got to do is win one out of three or Houston's got to lose something. That's all. They're in. Like the guy said before old art, who just turned 110. They won the NFL wild card. Nice going, Art. I think they want to stand the cup tonight. Is that what they once got? Sure. Last night. And I think art is skating on tonight's. Here's the call from beautiful Blinken Beach, hello. Pretty good sir. All right. I'm heading down to steam. You get some tickets. Are you going to just slap me now? What is it? Play off tickets for the ball. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, you've found it right now. I'm ending open to gates in 10 o'clock this morning. I'd haul my ass right down there now. All right. All right. Okay. Five, six, seven, five, 60, pound five, 60. What do you think there's long lines here? What? How's it looked to me like there was rain on it? Think I looked at the arridar on the scum sentence. Was radar a little while ago? Yeah. Are you following this? Are you just laying out? No. I'm waiting for the rest of it. You're watching the snow. Come on. I'm looking at the radar right now. And let me take a, let me update it on my screen here. Okay. Hit the animation on. I'm checking it out. I like that. That's big. And there's heavy duty rain, but in South day, not nowhere is near. It's like a little pee in it. It's like pee in just a little bit up near the stadium. I don't know what direction that's going in. But unless it's going like northeast, which I doubt. Huh? That could have usually been a fucking father. I'm into the Atlantic. Because down like south of Hylia, and lucky in the geables and cutler rage in the coconut grove and the homestead, and the environments in the P-Rion, those places, it's like a son of a bitch because God's pretty pissed off at him. People anyway. Especially in the geables where there are much of fashes. Oh, please put Van Halen on. List, ah, Jesus Christ. Are we going to go back with that again when Van Halen? Oh, we're going to hear some wonderful groups today. From Charles and Fort Lovative Beach. Okay. You got to Charlie. Okay. It tastes as in your push. I mean, a greatest other than the beat of the stones. Your all time favorite rock group is Van Halen. Oh, I'm going to try to let's a free country. At least this week. So I'm looking at that map. It's got like greens and blues and movie blues on come here. Oh, how about the movie blues? There you go. Huh? We're talking about. We have something to book it across there. Moody blues. Good group. Oh, the punch don't have any idea who that is. Nope. Why is that I wonder? Ah, they're old. Well, so the doors, doors, were old and more than done. How many years ago? I've heard a man. Yeah. Eagles, Eagles are old. Yeah. I mean, ours. Jesus Christ. How many years ago was their last son? About third man. Yeah. So what does old have to do with it? Steve Carter just turned 97. He's old. He's still kicking ass. Oh, that's so good. That's such a great song. He just never, I don't know why. He'll never really get the credit and the place in music history. Let he deserves. Jim Morrison. Why is that? To R.C. Part C? Sure. Oh, he was a poet. This song was R.C. Fart C? You heard great men through the talk. Oh, yeah. That came well. I thought it was done that day. That's what they wanted to come up with. They did music. Didn't even work. They were going to do it. It's suicide. That's it. Oh, it's dead, boys. Did you better sing a lot? Come on, come on, come on, come on. Not touch me, baby. Can't you see that I have that phrase? That's R.C. Fart C? Yeah. No, it's not. I'm going to pop it. The other start crazy. Touch me with an R.C. Fart C. They were an R.C. Fart C band. Okay. Is that a knock? Are you actually sitting there? I love the New Wars. Oh, my God. George is this in the doors, man. Why would you say that? There's a door right across from you there. And the way I'm starting to think right now. I heard the local of this. This is five, six years. There are years over yours. Oh, my God. George is this in the doors, man. Why do you ask to? Oh, don't be fooled by the rocks in my pants. I'm chiny with the big fat for the reek and I got a secret You might not understand. I'll bet you didn't know I'm really a man. A shake-leaf, whatever you can do, you'll chuck. But I'm still known as the girl from the block. For me, my money and that. But very little know that I have a thing. I started to think like this in my teens. But I think I could book a queen with just some caragines. They go on teach. My body's way around it. Like that, George, you I'm a manly man. That's not cottage cheese on my can. I got my way back there in the gem. My hair is real. Give it a squeeze. And my hair, too. I do look better, cap my husband and advice. But I got a little cold. So I don't have a choice. I like this surprise and the eyes of the boys When they get a load of items, I'm circumcised toy. Nothing else is going to know harmonies. But I'm the mine clothes. But rest is me. Don't be fooled by the rocks in my pants. I'm gently with the big pet color. Reekend. I gotta see if you may not understand. I bet you didn't know I'm really a man. A shake-leaf, whatever you can, who'll you chuck. But I'm still known as the girl from the block. For me, my money and that. But very little know that I have a big, true living. She's a guy who would have strapped on. I believe, 1102 is 560. That would be QM. Maybe that's why pens get a little bit nervous. You think? About 1. 282 votes. We did it. We actually exceeded the yesterdays to 8. Oh, 22. How are D.197. 69.8%. A little bit better than Wesley Clark did yesterday. Although, no. Not marginally. George W. 40.16.3%. And yesterday, he had what? It about 16%. And I wouldn't vote 39.13.8%. How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say?

How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? Where did he say it? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? How did he say? Hare let's read the reading one another only.

I wrote them both. You read them both, huh? Yes. OK. So that 29 is the final total. 69.8% for Howard Dean 202 George W 46, just under 16%. Pretty lame. I wouldn't vote 41.14. 1%. Anyway, somebody told Miss Fudge that Robert Palmer died because the whole Fudge report this morning is busy tied up with the Robert Melon's scape Richard Melon's scape scrap. Whatever his name is. About Wesley Clark. And he said this way. Praise the boy. That's a whole thing. Just how does it feel this to be a lemon to be just used, Matt, Miss Fudge? You're a little silly goose. You silly little faggot. You little wimp. You fruit fly. You butterfly and heat. God. Hold them website is taken up on all this crap. Not come Wesley Clark because they're they're crap in their pants. Now all these right wingers that the Democrats actually are going to have a candidate who can win. And they're just new. Huh?

I hear that Joe has steel balls. Here's a call from Papino. Hello. And you. Yes sir. I've got a stomach if you. Yeah. But I'll obey. Yeah. I want to put it in the air. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay, Neil. You know what I say, don't you? No. Open and check. Yeah. I come back to the color from the other side. Okay, won't man. Pretty lame. Pretty weak. I thought it was somebody doing a forlumitation. I thought it was p-p-d-lany again. Doing a bed scuffer element. Are you going to be my six? What was it? That was going to be my guess. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon. Wireless line. Here's a call from prestigious. Hello. Yes, for I just. Yeah. Another funny call. This is David Boy. Yeah. Okay. Cox the Haze. Why? What are you making the gutterable noises about there? Wrong. Here's Miramar. Hello. Yes sir. Hi. Hi. This is your more. I'm calling for the last time. I'll be moving back to Philadelphia once on the. Oh, right. Congratulations, dear sir. Yeah. I even know what's silly. But I mean, if you love drugs, you'll love silly. Say the high, the Gene Hart's body. But I just wanted to say. I'm sorry. I want to say something about the power Dean. I mean, I know he's got balls and everything. And I like the guy. But he looks inferred and Al Gore. That's possible. And I really, you know, with the intelligence of the average American, they're going to vote for a guy. They'd rather have a couple calls for your beer with. Yeah. He's not warm and fuzzy. He's atleast me. Yeah. I think I didn't care. I'm supposed to let him live. I'm supposed to let him live. I'm supposed to let him live. It's not me. I'm supposed to let him live. I'm supposed to let him live. I'm supposed to let him live. I'm supposed to let him live. You're supposed to let him live. That's why I didn't vote for Bush. He seemed like the core got to hang with me. And I think that's put a boil down to a lot of people along with all the crap they could. So who do you see there yesterday if you saw him. That debate who you thought was warm and fuzzy. God of be set out. Pragey. Well my name is Clark because he might not be, you know, I don't know, he might not have a big person. I mean, he's more of a middle-rounder. I think the right way or is my settle for him or whatever, but I think that, you know, he'll grab a lot of the Albuvots because he's a military man who can come and push on his bulls. I never killed anybody right. I take Kennedy. Okay, good luck in Powell. Have a great life. Okay. Well, I mean, there was just like a long pause there and I think he was trying to say. Goodbye. Good bye. Say, baby. Goodbye. Here's a facts from Jerry and but he distrains his a chronic facts. Here's his I'd like to suggest the band for your poll or the best rock bands or the Beatles and the stones I got it down. Although they had only one big hit single up on Griffa Creek. They were truly a great grassroots rock and roll band. All that anyone has to do is watch the DVD of the last Walsh concert to fully appreciate how great this band is. Says Jerry. You appreciate how great this band is? They were okay. They were okay. It says I guess I should say how great this band was since Robbie Robertson the group leader of the opportunity movie soundtracks and their bass player and keyboard player are dead. Anyone of their albums is a standout piece of work. This was not a boy band. All five members played made different instruments. The they had three lead vocalists which gave this group a unique sound. Where in the hell is music gone while steering beneath a springstone? They didn't go on solo. Everybody had a solo. I'm crossing USA. Oh, then everybody beats. Like California. But that's California. See, that's why the Beast Boys ain't too big anymore. They didn't know how to set California. Then say right. Like Arnold. That to me is just it's mind blowing. It's just it's astonishing to me that anybody could take him seriously. Much less vote for him for dog catcher. Oh, no. Arnold's got now the GOP support me on Arnold is solidifying behind Arnold and they're going to put them over. Because once again, he merking public is going to be shown that right wing for Business and Lunatics on the extreme right can manipulate the electoral process. Harvard and how they want. Oh, you want the election in California. What will show you will have another election? And then we'll put in some group ball, some movie star and some little Rejects and we'll take it right out of your hands. I hate that when they take it right out of your hands. Andy and Miami says although I can name you about oh yeah, I guess who. I'm going to play some guess who I think. Good. Just a little I don't want to play too much of any of this because when I play music, man, that's You into this crowd. The fact that that's what turns about. Oh, like like what? Like a boy. You see him wearing their bag. You're wrong. You're absolutely wrong. Okay. I have three CD ultimate collection. It's awesome. Please play Russia. Son on on of the New Year. Says Andy Miami. Okay, Andy's got it. We'll play it if you have stayed. But on up junior. Let's see. Oh, and appearance today. Would you cost? Wow. We last time raised a few bucks.

Well, I got them straight enough. They'd like to watch over you, money for a while. Without paying you no interest. I'd like to watch over it to get no interest. Anyway, best in the old 2002 2003 CDs cassettes. The more Howard David and keychains. And the spade and spin the wheel for Marlon tickets and grand pre tickets too. I mean like that. And so far our total. That's looking up a little bit 25,000, four ten. What's wrong with that? Well, I mean, it's a week later than I wanted to. But we're starting a little. Remember, those are just the practice month. Anyway, that's just gravy. Boy, oh boy, too bad about that scar on your cheek. What about it? Is there any scar on it? You know, Aaron, gravy? Nope.

And all of a sudden people started saying, what the hell is this? You called this freaking music or what? Rap. Now I can find some good rap crap for you. Oh no. Oh no. I mean, talk about bad luck. I can't find one rap video under. What's the chances they got about 400 video channels up here. I can't find one rap song. No, you can say anything to rap. I can't believe it's happened to me. Now what about your pansy boys that run around in their underwear? What else that group? Blink 182. Blink 182. No matter about how chilly peppers. Why don't we have them on there? They used to be pretty good long time. Now they're still in heroin. Red hot chili peppers and the Blink 182. George likes them because they're ugly guys. They're running around there. Underwear. I like them because they play good music. I see. What station are they on? They are 5605. 5605. 560. The AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's a call from Miami. Hello, Neil. Yes sir. How you doing? Okay. A couple days ago, Laura Bush was on one of the morning talk shows. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm talking about reading stuff. So once some of the books that she said that she reads for, I don't know, self-help. Maybe I am Sam book to help the President with his grammar. She said that the book that she's reading right now for pleasure is called the Polish Toll. The Polish Toll? That's correct. I'll be damned. I thought that you might find that a little bit of trivia. Maybe about Monica. She won't be able to taste tofu. She polished her craft, her trade. So the Polish Toll is reading the Polish Toll? No, I have not. I said the Polish Toll is reading the Polish Toll. I see, okay. Have a great day, Pat. You too. Oh, she said you too. I know he had mentioned a band before the thing was there. The Polish Toll is reading the Polish Toll. See, he was trying to like the cute. Let's see cute. No. But that was good. Good call man. Erosmith 29, the Doris 27, Ego's 25 and Hella 22. We got a real battle going. But like I said, as soon as Eric gets finished with his extraordinarily important business, and we start getting some of these other groups like Led Zeppelin on there. Is Led Zeppelin on there yet? I see 90s nails. I think you're a sandbag and somebody's going to try to make a little more go ahead of it. Quickly. Huh? Led Zeppelin off like a half hour ago. Well, we got 100-83 votes in it. We got about 400, uh, we're not 400, but lot of them that don't have any votes here. I'm not turning man. But I don't see no Led Zeppelin. I just mentioned that because AC DC will certainly get a lot of they on their yet. No. So just relax, let's go in. 90 degrees. How many votes are they going to get? Huh? I make change my vote. I already voted for Erosmith. See, you won't give 908 degrees no credit because it's a boy band. Therefore, automatically it must be bad. They can't sing automatically. They can't rock and roll. They can't sing. They can't sing. They can't roll. They can't rock and roll. And they got no soul and stick it in your hole is what I say. How do you like that? That's my comma. Since this is a whole week, I'm going to for Rellez morning. Here's whole intensive. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh. I ain't taking no chances. It's almost as good as putting on Playboy TV. And you call that music? No, it's crap. It's crap. That good. I like some rap that ain't it. Speaking of Playboy TV. You call that a fetus? She's opening your small package. We inside the package. Take the bod soaps. Your toiletries. Make up into the bathroom. You're finding bop rope in the bathroom. Start a huff off and add the salt. When you've done that, then have completely undressed. You can open present number two. Oh, you know who gave her present number two? Roy! Roy! And roles, this is for 20-5-50 years. You and who are you having? He was obsessed. Mary. Are you in there? Oh, yeah. With a need for privacy. Mary? Come out this instant. He spent hours locked in his little fantasy world. Mary! Are you listening to me? You've been in that long enough. The bathroom. Mary! I'm coming! And what have you been doing in here all morning, young man? The tango. We know brothers' pictures presents the gripping tale of. Harry Palmer, privately showing this November. See, we don't have any Robert Palmer but so far to Harry Palmer be the next best thing. How'd it have been? It's in the same family. Here's a fact that says I don't know what the hell this means. Rogers, finally some good music for me. What does that mean? I think that's a shot at your boy brand brand shows that you'd... I don't do... How many years has it been since I played any of that? I've already met. I don't know. That's all past that anyway. I mean, that was a pretty interesting time by 3 years ago when at least people were interested in music and was a lot of that stuff as popular and some pretty good stuff too. But at any rate, and actually people were buying CDs back then as opposed to just deal them. Well, we got that stir on our website today about how a few things are bad in the US. Just take a peek at what's happening on here it is. US is only the tip of the power to music iceberg from New York Times. Maybe they didn't put it on there. I got it here. It's as hangar on any squirt art in Germany or college campus in Italy who becomes clear that the recording of this series problems with the illegal online distribution of music in the US pale beside the rampant power scene that goes on overseas. From factories in Taiwan and Eastern Europe that turn out counterfeits to these teenagers in Scandinavian Singapore who download songs from the internet and burden them on a blank list, the line between legitimate and power to music is all but vanished in many countries. How do you like that? I do that. We're back ready for a round two. There you go. I don't have it. I never did put it in there. But I do have it on the CDs. Oh, it was up to the whole zone. Another underrated group don't get no proof. We're white on. It may put girls jam on the list. I just said it. Oh, what a sense of fact. The algorithm is the only thing. How we underrated. As a matter of fact, with little inspiration, I just played a little bit of it. Oh, maybe that's the one I put in there, you think? Maybe. Why does it? Why does it? Why does it? Oh, maybe it's pretty funny. Anyway, super tractor great and nobody knows who to hellay are. They're great. Spectacular outstanding. Good by stranger might be the greatest song of all time. Well, from what I'm hearing. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T. Other than the Beatles and Rolling Stones, what's your all-time favorite rocker. If you tune in late, we got Joe Costata about there at a comp USM. He's got a thousand dollars already for a band of perversky doesn't he? They got 390, 250 that came from Joe's parents themselves. Well, thank you, Joe's parents. They're the best. They're great. They're mentioned. They're mentioned in the Guinness Book Records. They're phenomenal. In fact, any time we've done something, I guess his mom is a real like dog lover. Yeah, because then we do something before. That's right, when we was that old lady was caught and bugging me and then she could push me and push me like how much money could she squeeze for that one little dog. But anyway, Joe's mama also kicked in some cash. They're great. So, 190 bucks isn't pretty good start out there for a band and perversky. Joe is at comp USA, 11170 Weston rise, bull of our plantation. Right by that, Michael's a trotty and restaurant and right behind the watch over your money bank. All the best in your stuff is there. They got the Moharadibe the key chains, which I think are picking up. And you can still believe that. What? They're worth picking up. And you can spend a real for Marlon tickets and grand pre tickets as well. With Joe, of course, the big grand pricks fan. Erosmith 31, Doris 29, Eagles 26. It's a battle.

Here's Bob Faxes and says, The case you missed the open today's New York Times, Herb Gardner playwright passed away. Man, they're dropping like flies, let me see it again. I saw a thousand times on Broadway, And thought Murray Burns was a role model for all the ages. I fancy in the open, I think you'll see the humor he was fired from the Bliss display company, where he carved wise men for nativity scenes for carving cross-eyed wise men. That'll like that. So herb Gardner died and Robert Palmer died and who is yet a one? Uh, and somebody else knew what I didn't know. No, because he was an old first. So you would know. So there you go. They're dying. They're dropping like flies. So enjoy while you can. It's our best advice to you. There's a lot of people I could be enjoying it. Young people too. They're showing pictures in memory now.

Dead in the water. Maybe I didn't punch it up. Let me try it again. Miami Beach. Neil. Yes, sir. There. I was there. I was there. Okay. I'm sorry. You know, I heard a couple days ago that the report coming out on a few weeks about actually no weapons and mass destruction, no traces. If I recall correctly, wasn't the earlier this year that Bush was saying, so that needs to disarm. Disarm. Disarm. If there was nothing to disarm, then where does that put our president? In deep due to. It puts a bit about 15% against Howard Dean on our poll today. Yeah, I can't believe that you know, first it was nuclear. It puts on a back kind of ration Texas after next January. Chemical and biological weapons and it was this and it was all right. All of the pack allies man all of pack allies to fight a war that they decided on four years before they ever started it. Exactly. But what did do these people actually a must think that the people of this country are pretty stupid? Well, wait a minute, when you say must think 69% of the people two weeks ago said that Sodom was involved in 9 11 and then and then even after a rum spelled and Bush, or came on said no, there's nothing to indicate that and then probably still 50% believe it no matter what they tell them. I think it's most of the people in this country sit there and get all their 10 seconds of news from the talking head network that they're all right. It's right for not certainly not as yet whatever the talking head cell and that's what they believe in it. Right. It's said it's said the country's going down the toilet. You got it.

And they'll have the best meal stuff. Plus. Plus. Plus. So much money. Price and free. Well, I need to do some stuff. What a sense of humor. He writes off the SH. Like I'm going to go ahead and read it. No way. I'm meeting real. They told me I was a senior citizen at the bank the other day. But nevertheless. I still got it. How's Joe Costello doing we know? They're given away so many marlins tickets you wouldn't even believe it. And they're still at 390. That's a joke, right? No, it's not a joke. They'd ought to be a joke, but it's not. They had 390 like by 120 because most of it came from mom and dad Costello. Correct. So they're not ricking anything for the best meal. You people are the cheapest bunch of bansters, not all you just most. There's a few, you know, about 30 man. Yeah, who are reaching the pocket and come up. You know, I had to be in abandoned cat or dog right now. I'd say that because if I had to count on a people of South Florida, I probably have to go like a panhandling. I'm good at it. Well, you better hit the road because they're sure not going to help you out either. This is sad. Are you making that up just now? No, it means that. You're not through. This is not a bogus location either. This is not a copy USA. 120 170 West sunrise Boulevard Plantation in a little strip shopping center. Whether behind the betting place that used to be Boston Market, right kitty corner from Circuit City and right kitty corner from much over your money bank. The best in the LCDs cassettes and the more Howard David of the highly touted and voted and desired key chains. They're there. And then you can spin a wheel from all the tickets and grant pretty tickets. So the same thing as the other day at the Howard Convention Center. A lot of people come in spinning. They want their free martin tickets. Are they given anything for charity? Oh, do they care about our frequencies? These are the key chains? No. A Pax on that crowd. That's the best I can say. A Pax on you. Okay. I can't even believe that. That 45 minutes later, there has been one person come in there and cough up a dime. No, but they're wrapped around the van for those tickets. Are they really? Yeah, it's what he said. Here's Pomp and O.B. Hello. You're high now? Yes sir. Yeah, I've got an addition for your list. Okay. Emerson Lake and Palmer. Emerson Lake and Palmer. Good, pretty good. Marjan. They'll do a pretty strict group for their time with the synthesizers and cop, cop, was a heck of a percussionist in the red lake. I would like to wrap all the whamerson. Me too. Anyway, I just want to ask you something. I want to make a contribution to band and rescue. And I know you're now checking to you people. So to us, we are sending to Washington, I want second and I'll let Skattle put it out. I appreciate that. That's great. We appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Okay. Okay. Put him on hold there online too for you. So they're wrapped. Now see, here's the interesting part of this. See, the people who are wrapped around a QM van. They're not just people who happen to be like in the vicinity and they saw the van sitting there. You know, and then roll out GLC, what's going on over there. No, these are people who are listening to this radio show right now. Right. Have been listening at least for a part or all of this show since 10 o'clock this morning. Mm-hmm. Another way, new exactly where Joe was. They knew where Miguel was. They knew where the van was. And they made a B line over there when he heard me say, Spin the wheel for Marlon tickets and grand pre tickets. Free. Spin the wheel. Right. That's the part that really just sticks in my back home crawl. Just enough to really piss off the freaking Pope was feeling a little bit better. They and they're really good ball movement even better than Bougsombie. That's what he said. So when and out on. Shaving it out. Aeroscmeth 39, the Doris 38, Led Zeppelin 35. Van Hillon 32, Eagles 28, Metallica 23, the Van 18. There's the real, real suspect. Rush 16, Pink Floyd 13, Moody Blues 13, The who 11 beats boys still have 10 George even after I played a middle of.

Who are you? People out there, kid, huh? Right. Three hundred ninety bucks and out of dime for the last forty five minutes. And the QAM band. Which I say. A Pax on you. 560560, pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Now the US holder killed in Kirk Hoop by the way. This morning case you missed that. South Cookie. They're dying over there every day. And we had that debate yesterday. I thought Wesley Clark was okay. I didn't think he was dynamic. I didn't think he was anything special. But he was okay. He didn't fall down. I heard his performance and me to press was Simulating. That's what Tim Russell said. So what he said with that red pasty Irish face of his. Here's a call from Tampa. They've been on there in off a long time. And I apologize profusely. Hello. Okay. How you doing now? Pretty good. Thank God for screaming on the internet. You're talking about the bands you put on a list. No one's brought this band up yet. You're talking about 70s and them. You got to put sticks on the list. Sticks. Got it. I'll sign it on there right now. And you got it on right as you speak. And you have. I know somebody said put Van Halen on. But you got to put an extra. You have to put Van Halen without Samy Hagar. Not Van Hagar. You have Van Halen. Well, that's where they're voting for. Yeah. They're voting for. And don't put. Were you putting boy bands on there? Don't put a couple on. They're just for little punky kids. Well, you know, we talked about putting the brown eye on the straight guy. Man, these these bands are uh. That's a hop. That's not rock. Yeah. But that. Anyway, doing a great job. I learned you. I'm think I've right. Again, think I was pretty streaming up here. We can get some good. Hey, man. God bless America man. Have a great day. Hey, the pooper and Tampa. All right. Bye. What do you say? Jean Cooper's in the pooper. That's what he said. Arrow Smith is still one. I had 39 38 over the doors. Boy, Kim Morrison will be so depressed. I think we can forget about the beat boys. I think they're done well, Bonnie. Can you throw up? Can you throw that foot? Can you throw that foot? Why don't you try? Oh, I'm ready. You just remember, Benito. He was hanging there in the room. That's what's got to say. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Marvel's line. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, how about you doing the Louis and the Louis? Get it right on there, George. Yeah. The gooey Jews and the gooey Jews and the juice. You're doing the Louis. Gooey Jews and the with a new. Don't be putting gooey Louis on there. Oh, very upset. Let me see the beat boys up to 12 now. See? Beat boys are up to 12. They're like right on the moody blues ass. The band 19, though, we're keeping our eye. I got my eye peeled on that thing. Real real close. Mad dogs coming up with two to the Humperate 4. We got any more money out there. Would you or Custella or not? Cause I'm not. I'm going to have to have nothing yet. Since. I really, I just can't believe it. I just can't. I can't see the thing the other day at the Broward Convention said. The excuse was all was inside. They had a pad mission to get in and it's a place where only the computer nerds are going. And the odd yad yad yad yad yad a purtree. This is right there at Comp USA. I've shot there many times. I go in there like it encourages stuff like that. You know, right in the, um, what's sunrise right there in my hood, right in plantation, right in the Equate. That should be all our crowd out there. That should be all our people out there. And for last 52 minutes, we've got. Quot squad is what we got. We got squad. We're squatting. Now we'll take it up squad is right myself right now. I've been burasing if they did better yesterday, 800 at the wherever they go. You know, something I don't think it's going to be a contest. We're going to bring 90 and tooth and 250 was for mommy and daddy. Custell. 800 yesterday down there in the Adamsville down in those picking. Because we went and held down the under. Where was that at due to us or someplace like that? I don't know. Card sound road. I think they were at. Yeah. Like we're on the tip of the keys around Alabama. Jacks Jesus, K. Christ. Then they got 190 bucks and most of his like an inside job. So if you people don't come to you by tour clock, I think. I think we're going to like, I'll go on strike. My life in local. We're sports video five 60s. You and you A.M. Hello, come on, come on, come on. Taxi, baby. Uncle San Pedro, I'm holding better than I did. All right. And while you're at it all the day. You're at insults to injury. Just take my first one baby. Now I'm taking the Dutch on. Now the old game. I'm going to find some taxables. Oh, just to make those really soft piss. The IRS. I'm going to go to New Zealand. Come on, come on, come on. Taxi, baby. Tax my dog, tax my freaking to pay. Tax my pay. Shunch, tax my sanity. And I'm going to New Zealand. Meanwhile, I ain't going to think that's it. The interesting part of what I'm much of free loading per running ponies. We haven't so thought is remember a month ago. Maybe it wasn't this season. Maybe it was last year. We tried to give Marlon tickets away on a year. Oh, yeah. Couldn't give them away. No. Couldn't give them away. Earlier this year. Absolutely no interest. How do parents is earlier this year? Right. And that's right. If you remember you told me the one thing, people were giving you Marlon tickets. Right. I tried to have you give them away. Now all of a sudden we're trying to raise money for a way to go to charity with our usual nifty merchandise that we come up with. And instead it's like, oh, they're all lined up about five miles all the way to the goddamn sawgrass. Because they want to spin the wheel. They go Marlon tickets in the grand pre-tickets. He called it an update in an interesting story. Yes. Some old bag showed up to get her free whatever it was. Oh, hey. They tried to push the CD. Oh, I hate you, ragged. Really? Yeah. So she heard you hear the images. Well, right. How did she hear about this? She didn't have any place to say this station. You miserable nasty old bitch. I sure hope he didn't give her nothing but a kick in the ass. And she and he said, well, what about the dogs? Forget your writers. What about the little dog? I hate me, ragged. Yeah. Well, we hate you too, bitch. Four times. How much? Four ten. That's like one CD. That's twenty bucks. Right. Or a keychain. That's too moody. That means that the They've raised today. 160 bucks. Right. In an hour and 20 minutes. 160 bucks. This is the last year we're doing this with all the respect to a van of per rescue. I would just, it's just as simple to me. I can write them my check for the 10 grand every year. Just direct to them. And that's it. Save the grief. Right. What's the play going through all this exercise and through all of this work? And by the time you take away the expense and the cause of everything, what the how we're going to have left. This is the most embarrassing town in the history of mankind. The cheapest, the most free loading is nasty. Rotteness, do nothing, give nothing people. Not all of them. Just about 90%. Yep. Four ten. Because I know that location like the goddamn, he'll have, he'll have my foot. That's a busy bustle bustling area. Right. There's tons of parking all over there. There's all kinds of businesses there. It's a commercial area. Right. I'm so happy. Have you do the busy busy busy plays? Not a slum. Four hundred and ten bucks, two fifty from mommy and daddy, custella. Hundred and sixty bucks in our twenty minutes. You people are an embarrassment of this grace. You really are. Free. I ought to know what it's all about because I've been in South Florida long time. About thirty man. Yeah, then you're thirty years on a year. I know as freebies and early bird dinners. That's it. Never got a change. You've all my shot expected to change. You only think is it's getting tighter and tighter and tighter and in terms of people come and kind of lose with a few bucks. Anyway, I'm not going to get excited about. Because what am I going to do? What's the point? We did our part. Did our damn thing people showed up there. They're trying, you know, and then I want to say this to you right now. I don't want in the future. I don't want to be lumped in with all this other crap with the spinning the wheel for freebies. No. You got your regular parents tomorrow at Bill Siddles and you have the merchant nice there. You know, on the side because you're going to be there anyway. Sure. And you do those deals all the time. So much of a guy. Hey, stop with your guy. Yeah. You don't mean to mean it. But as far as doing these vans hits and everything. No, no. And we never used to do that anyway. See, this is part of the thing that's broken me off this year is that now we're in of course the response would be well, but this is to draw a lot more people there because we have free stuff. Well, the free loaders aren't going to cough up any money for charity. All that does is clog up the works. That's all. It if you accomplishes absolutely nothing for abandoned per rescue or for the efforts that were put now or anything at all. It's counterproductive. So stick it under the counter. Okay. Somebody says no doubt. It says so you can play a drop. No. Yeah. As in. No. It's as hard as you've voted. So I don't care if you put a mind. I thought that. So now this other facts from Vic and I was just he must be psychic or I am because I was just about to talk about this. See, you get into the definitions. I was just I guess I may be one of the few actually gets the pull questions because of the way they're worded. I know you endured to get a ripping a new one, but you may have to do a lot more ripping than you would imagine. If your list wouldn't be so extensive to include such marginal crappy bands, I wouldn't even bother but please. And rock bands, they're all more pop than anything else. See, the definition of rock, I was just thinking about that. It's all subjective. Right. Like people used to listen to she or what that was before magic one or two point. What do you, whatever that was. That was rock, see. But rock music to let the Beatles are rock. The Beach Boys are rock, boy bands can be rockets. It's all encompassing rock and roll is a whole bunch of things. And the people who think that rock and roll means hard rock. Well, you know, to bad. For the addition to which I don't even know what is point is here if your list wouldn't be so extensive to include such marginal crappy bands. I wouldn't have even bothered. Bob, what is that mean? I don't know. So what? I mean, I don't know any, is there a crappy, really a crappy band on here? I mean, yeah, there's some boy bands on there just for kicks for the kids for early, the four little girls we got, you know. But I mean, other than that, are there really any crappy bands on this list? I don't see any. Deal? No. Outside of the ones that you just mentioned. No, seriously. I mean, setting those three or four side. Well, I can't stand motley crew personally, but that's just me. But nobody would say there are crappy bands. Oh, they're like a crappy band. They're, I just said it. Do you hear you go again? No, what do we only got four hundred and ten bucks? They don't like you. Four thirty. No, it looks like one twenty four to four hundred and thirty bucks. Yeah. Oh, and they're outside. So there's no excuse at all. They could just drive by and get the stuff. Yeah, the guys doing the killer outside now. They're outside of the van. They've come out there. They're standing in a rain, which is probably not raining. In fact, let me, let me take a look at that. Maybe that's an excuse, you think? How can that be an excuse if they were lined up around the van for the guy named Fee Marlonti? It sounds like a pretty lame excuse to me. Three loaders, bandwagon, jumpers, front running phonys. What a horseball placement. Makes me so glad that I'm here with real freaking people. Carlos Delgado at four homerms last night. But there was only thirteen thousand to see him at the sky. Oh, but nevertheless, the rain's gone. Rain is not on there. The rain is off El Neta, La Mapa. It's all out in the Atlantic. Look at that. There is no drop of rain on my radar here. You see it? Can you see it? Nope. It's all in the ocean, man. There's nothing. So that's no excuse. There's no rain. There's no snow. There's no sleep. There's no rain or snow. There's just Miguel and Joe. How do you like that? And you people blow. Most of you. Few good ones. Fuck third man. Although 30 would be like times twenty. That would be six hundred. So not even that. In other words, we've raised 180 bucks. See that's a deal. Everybody sit back and let somebody else do it. Let up. Come in with a nice check which he did this morning. Thanks again, Duff. That's somebody else. I'll circle out. I'll pop the bucks. Oh, wait. What? I was coughing. Oh. You can stroke that. Yeah. No point. No use. No use. No doubt. 26 past one and five sixty. Nobody can get the man dog. I'll be along in two or five. All you. All you phony phony phony. Front running phony's man. Who the hell are you kiddin'? Oh, we're standing in the rain out here. We're so wound up in the Marlins area. Right. Let me see it again. We couldn't give the tickets away. If we put a $5 bill alive, we'd have paper clip with each ticket. Maybe we might have been able to give more. But probably we're one of the 20. Okay. You make it 50. Time's at tough now. You know. 430 bucks. Right there in the middle of plantation acres. Right there on sunrise Boulevard. A stone throw from my house. And by that I think I might turn to break call the house. And with instructions for a breached his day are coming in your direction. You cheap, cheap, tight wads man. Just enough to make my blood curdle. Enough to make me sit off on a guy named Florey eating my curds in way. A lot. 27 past one a QAM. If you want to plunge your guts out, see that you don't have no problem with that.

He just happened to be in the hood. Sandy. Like by the way. Who? Sandy. Your neighbor. Oh, hi, Sandy. But to make a long story short. Bottom line is men. The overwhelming majority of people. It would look to finger for anything. If it's free, it's me. That's the motto. No wonder remember one of gravitating to South Florida. It's like a magnet. If it's free, it's me. There you go. Perfect place for him. Land of the cheap, the desperate, the destitute and whatever else. So 540. So 250 and 580. We got to get to 750 or I'm not going to put up with it. I'm not going to sit still for it. I'm going to roll on a floor in agony. Here what I'm saying? Agony? We have 540. We need another 210 because that would mean we raise 500 which is pretty pissport in two hours. But at least I would make it worth their while being there. Right? We pay for the gas for the van.
