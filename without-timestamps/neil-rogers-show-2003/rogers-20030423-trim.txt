And just program it internally on a loudspeaker system in the radio station. You're asking why would I suggest that? Why would you suggest that? Yeah. Thank you very much for thinking of that question. Okay. And then you say it for the interview. And give him the content of the program. Oh, you people in the radio station give a crap about what that pedicold man is talking about. Talk about the podcast and kettle-pues man, pathetic old man. Woo. You're in denial. See, I guess the age thing really got to him when we finally fingered it out. When we said that, with a pencil and pad, then sighed for it, and I've since he enjoyed watching Thai-complete baseball back in the early part of the century. He's got to be like over 100, his age. I'm serious. I mean, here's a guy that talked about his recollections of post-Sovle War. And he's talking about me being a pathetic old man. Woo, you kidn-mo, an addition of which the audience loves the inside stuff. One of our world-famous polls we did a few months ago. And far beyond anything else in the world, they want to hear inside crap, man. That's where I'll let shows us so popular. Right. Inside addition, outside addition, current addition, last addition. That's what the public wants. There's a lot of dirt. And believe me, a QM we got lots of dirt. We're blowing dirt all over the place. Look at that pool that he was upset about. He's upset about a lot of things, I guess. I mean, and here was my good-closed personal buddy, you know? Airbie Davis, when you think you're on the verge of really bonding with the mole myster and then all of a sudden he turns like a cornered rat.

marlin games one eighty one don't change a thing it's fine and even five percent seventy four people said that and even five percent we could do that again if we tried could we i doubt it seventy four

time i heard it the other day that he's not going to be there i mad dog was talking about yesterday he's already a talking what he's going to be doing and talking about and this and that so i don't think he's going to have much influence over the mad dog on this one does anybody else now so mad dog will be there because that's the course part of the deal but the more man since he's got such strong a numbers to back him up he's uh playing hard to get playing fast and loose with Greg's emotions can you imagine if they play by playguard for the team didn't you up at the draft party can you

And this is just your opinion based on what you've heard what you've experienced Whatever buggy got up your ass Hopefully it's not SARS Paris New York Oh Phil Podelvia or Oh my amy And now you're gonna say Miami? Yeah, I'm going to so my Ho ho ho ho ho. I'm not I'm saying Philadelphia Follow up. It's there. That's not fair That's very unfair to my old friend What was his name David der Savito? Remember David Savito? No. He was a Permetic in a Hollywood maybe he's he probably still old ago David was from Philadelphia. He was a fine fine American Or whatever it wholly was fine aguito Love you David, but he's probably getting old and ugly now, but anyway, maybe he looked good So he was from Philadelphia. They look good. That's fine. The new nice people No, not even the uh, I don't know. Ferti showed the shots of the crown to Game Last then a fully man. What a- oh, you just look at a lot of those people to say, FET! Some of them probably are from the Fed Dying. Wouldn't surprise me. Not big on the Philadelphia's, but you're right.

We're not just talking about one Aberron, like January, when a bunch of old-retarded, the drunken goofballs got diaries and accidentally put the moment down on it. We're talking about a real test. A real test of stick to it of this and longevity. I think by Monday he's out. How many times have you heard about an opportunity and you didn't act? You didn't grab onto it. You missed out. Well, right now it's one of those times. Rarely does an opportunity to rub the rest of what you're doing. But this one ought to. You ought to stop and put your head right up in the air. Stick it up there. Interest rates have gone down even lower than they were before. Which is amazing. The financial group was offering an interest rate of 3.45 percent and they lowered it to 2.95 percent. Now, rates have gone down even lower. 2.45 percent financing with the financial group. Let me say it again. 2.45 percent you heard right. So, confidential group and check this out. 1.894 Oland. Because these interest rates probably won't last for a long. Here's the window of opportunity for you to hop through with the financial group. You're self-iniquetable low rate of just 2.45 percent and say thousands and zittians and dollars. Coal financial group has a toll-free call. Be sure and mention Todd Brex name when you call. 1.894 Oland. What will 2.45 percent financing do to those monthly payments. You might be wondering, I'll give you some for instance. If you have a $200,000 loan, you pay only $786 a month. If you have a $100,000 loan, you pay only $393 bucks a month. So do it now. Do yourself a humongous favor and call financial group toll-free. At 1-800, 9-4 Oland, 1-800, 9-4 OLE-ND. The renequal housing lender, credit restrictions apply rates. There's something to change without notice. 5.34 APR. I have a new suggestion for Gregory, the general manager of this place. You do. Yes. Take Neil his program off the air where people can hear it. And just program it internally of a loudspeaker system in the radio station. You're asking why would I suggest that? Why would you suggest that? Thank you very much for thinking of that question. The reason is, I'm insightful interview. And give him the content of the program. I want you to people in the radio station give a crap about what that pathetic old man's talking about. Absolutely correct. Take this off the air. Come on. Come in and make a phone. Because I'm sorry. I don't go out at all. I send off the indoors. Because I don't want to die from stars. Oh, because of stars. I've got a surgical mask. I look like Michael Jackson. But it's better than catching stars. Because of stars. Every time I know is runs, I call my doctor. And he tells me I don't have stars. Because of stars. I cry all the time. Tell my throat kind of raw. Oh my god. Does that mean I have stars. Who is he? Hi 33 at 5.60. Did anybody come to Sonny Shining? Could we all wait for 45. 46 today? Hahaha. Well, we're going through one of those screen time things. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. The spring up north. I mean, one day it would be like 83 and it's going to be 43. So it's a little variety. Come by the me. Sonny Shining is a beautiful experience. So it's a little bit of a variety of things. I'm going to open up the window right now and inhale. Really. And I can catch. See what's in the ear. I see somebody already voted on there along with me on a pool. You can put the pole up there already. You don't have to keep the pole down. We'll build it as we go. But you know, we unfairly, really cities that we have on it. And this isn't just the most obnoxious people in America or North America. This isn't a world. What city would you generally? I mean, you know, it's a generalization. But it's fun. It's a kind of stuff that they. They are. No other teeth on. What's that expression? They cut their teeth on. Oh, yeah. They've ever cut your teeth? No. Nobody's cute. I am. Speaking. Niel. I mean, my skin. Did you watch more of your last night? No, I did not. Was watching a hockey game. What have been a much better idea you're right? Oh, you made you leave Mr. Big deal. No. Nobody's mentioning it, you know. How big was it? Let me ask you a question. You didn't see the preview for next week? No. They show full back nude shot of your boy Clark. Black film. I don't care about his ass. I'd rather see. You're going to do the old cigarette spot. It's up front to it. It's what's up front to count. Take a thing. I'm smoked out in the back a little bit with a little clown. But they showed it. I really. I can't believe you haven't heard about it yet. I'm going to go in and market on a wall right now for next week. I said you will. Okay, my man. Thanks, man. He's not a pretty excited about it. Yeah. Wow. Woo. My man. He's my man. He's anybody's man. He's a man's man at the time. Well, I get I'm getting a swelling right now. I figured about. I'm not. I'm not into a ass. I know that's a very, you know, Rick Santorum probably wouldn't understand that. But then a lot of heteros don't understand that. These terminally heterosexual people like Rick Santorum and these other Republicans. Bad, you're a fag. Yeah, and of course that's the responsive. If it do that for years, the right wingers. They helps have to find a skate coat just like Hitler did. Of course Hitler found a lot of different ones. Rick Santorum, though. He's got real problems. Now he's got tourists under fire for comments on homosexuality. Top Democrats and gay rights advocates blasted comments by. Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, which he appeared to compare homosexuality to insets bigger men adulterary and then called on the Pennsylvania Republican to repudiate the remarks. One prominent Democratic group yesterday also called on Santorum to resign his leadership post in the Senate. Why'd house had no comment in this by the way? Guess who of course they asked and had no comment. Ari. Right. Ari. The fairy had no comment. This is just like Pete Williams all over again. Same thing. Same kind of crap. But nevertheless, I'll save that. Save that for the later. Because I don't want to read the moring dog column. Other great one. I don't think there's any words in there. I don't know either. I'm disappointed, Marine. It's really good. Do you take a peek at it? Yeah. Probably not. Okay. I'm bigger part. Nothing. There you go. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Did Doug come into tell you about the Schedule of Summer? No. Why not? Either have a thing-done school with the old Mulman this morning. Think that's possible. He didn't come and tell you the break of the news that Rick and Souther are going to be working this summer. Study you? No. Because they're not. I just thought I would say that. What do you need the extra cash? How about if they work and then they still pay you the extra cash? Hey, hey, great. I'll run the 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60. What's city? Will you find the most obnoxious people? And also, who should we have fill in this summer since it's coming up very soon? George or somebody else? Give us some names. Maybe we can have Moodoo the show. Okay. He's only doing 3 hours anyway. What kind of a show is that? A 3 hour show? I mean, mad dog does 2 hours because he's like a buffer on the station. Plus he's got that other business service, which is where he really makes all those money from. This is just like a hobby. WKOM? Yes, sir. I've been listening to you since you came to town back when you did, used to do the issue oriented shows. Oh, I'm so sorry. And the best way to, I think you ever did, was when you were doing the, you know, how on the else stuff. It was the best way of having done this part of the show. Oh, wow. But I got it. I'm sort of glad that you could go underneath your skin because things have, Well, what do you mean, you could go under my skin? What does that mean? Well, we start talking about the periodocles on the radio. Yeah. It got here. And this left of it. And I don't even think that this band is somebody other thing. I think this stuff with the mo. What kind of target is mo? Well, I mean, just day after day, you're firing away at them. And so, so I know it's what you're trying to do as tummy would I should do on the show is that was at the purpose of the call?

Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. W to Q a m. All right. Is this new rug? Yes sir. Hey Neil. I was watching hardball last night. I'm so sorry. I like that show. I like Christmas. I don't. Anyway. They showed those lunatics and I rack out in the streets. Yeah. And how a sixty percent of the population is she. And they want an I at Tola and they want to rip back. What I ran's got. And I just said what in the hell that we go there for. And all we did was open up the Pandora box. Yeah. How about how about the hundred percent on employment rate they've got. Pummerkerson unemployment. I mean, the people one thing that they keep saying over and over again is that most of us were working while Saddam was here as bad as he was. We were working. We had jobs. We had some ordered to our lives. Now there's total this order. There's a complete chaos. And almost nobody has a job because first of all they have a shop that hasn't been burned down yet. It's been looted. They have no merchandise anymore. And if they work in some kind of an office, most likely the buildings already been blown up. Chris had on the show. Chris had this guy. I can't remember the name. He looked Middle Eastern. He works for New Week International. Anyway, the guy was saying. In order for us to keep from the she eyes from taking over and installing their the accuracy and whatever. We'd have to stay there from three to five years. And I'd tell you what. I just don't see the Bush administration or any administration having to wear with all. To stay there for three to five years and put out with suicide bombings and whatever else goes along. Especially while we're busy invading Syria and all these other places for example I got a story here today. US has plans to bomb North Korea new plan. So we're going to be real busy. I guess. Have a great day. Pentagon has drawn up plans to bomb an North Korean nuclear plan if it reprocesses a spent nuclear fuel rods according to an Australian newspaper report yesterday that was downplayed quickly by Australian officials. Signing well informed canned burrosources close to US thinking the Australians for an editor Greg Sheridan said US is produced a blueprint to bomb young beyond if the plant went ahead with reprocessing spent nuclear fuel rods to make Adam bombs. He said the plan also involved the US strike against North Korean heavy artillery in the Hills above the board of South Korea threatening the capital's soul in about 17,000 US troops stationed nearby but Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downers shrugged off the report. He said it was a real downer which came on the eve of meeting in Beijing between the US China and North Korea aimed at ending a six month standoff over Pyongyang suspected arms programs. How do you like that? But we're standing by just in case we're ready to bomb a baby. We're going to be a bomba crondes. And then we're going to get Syria and then we're going to get our ran and then we're going to get Cuba and then we're going to get Mexico and Canada and Falkland Islands, Los Angeles and who after that? Libya, Uganda, Ireland, Scandinavia and any place else we feel like it on a given day, right? Yeah, Sudan. The Sudan only demoed. 560560 on the AT&T and Verizon. In fact, the CBSI's going to do that. Sudan for those week numbers. By the way, speaking of numbers Friday, Mark it on a calendar maybe. Oh, it's going to be a tremendous day. We don't know if it's going to be good or bad, but I just have a feeling in my bone and it's going to be really something that we're talking about for months to come. I'll be something other than Moe, but we can talk about most bad numbers. That kind of called a minute ago. What is that all about? I mean, what would it have come from? Huh? All over the place.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You wouldn't believe it. You're so obnoxious. Everything has got to be catered to that. Never wrong. As a Tony Bennett show, this is older guy in his wife, we're sitting in the wrong seats. And I said, sir, these people are supposed to be in your seat.

A very very interesting facts inside information to be broadcast inside the WQM building I better get out my megaphone we don't want to put this on the air get more upset. It says the NFL draft QAM broadcast party the Saturday from noon till question mark will be hosted by former Miami dolphin dolphin's broadcast during QM host Jim Mad Dog mandates. So right appearances also be made by the QM personalities like Steve Goldie Goldstein the big oh and former dolphin the big dog Joe rose. Dolphins play by play broadcast during QM host Howard David may not be able to attend as he has other commitments to these stars for star's foundation and their weekend at turnberry aisle. Now who would he be full and with that if he pulled that off everybody. He wouldn't know he would have be full in anybody. Because he's already been pontificating for weeks on here about he's not going to go unless the man who don't put in the suit. Who doesn't I'm putting the suit gets it straight not in pays a extra he's not going to show up this sounds to me like the kind of stuff he did with westwood one. They've got him uninvited to come back now could be wrong. I'm just reading between the lines but of course in somebody that building communicates with us and we get no information whatsoever. We have to rely on our sources on a fast machine. Isn't that basically how it works right. Because we get no information from clearance from muff they're all in hiding now they're holding their meter whatever they're doing. And by the way they word I heard before the show today is that Carlos got infected by muff that's what I heard. I don't want to give you any details. Huh? Well, Kingcory was wondering what the gigantic lump was on his throat and I just thought he got infected by the operations manager. I can't go into the grey details but that's the rumor I'm hearing. There is a spot marked on the wall right out there by the control room for the other shows. Granted Connecticut for the poll somebody says actually it says any city in Connecticut let's put granite on here. Can you spell it right green witch? I'm not talking about you and talk about being boy. He's had a lot of stress. He's not even I've gotten for him contracted his illness. They said they could contract him. Here's a fact it says woodwards book. Oh yeah, I wouldn't read that bush at war in general as a general reflection to W. But there was two things of note I thought you might want to know one is a quote lifted from juniors daily journal. Commenting on the Ask and War George W. wrote this is a war in which people were going to have to die. The no shmit it says people die and wars who know. The other thing was about your personal good friend Candelisa on page 92 would were right about a cabinet meeting at Camp David. We're going to read the book. Why is that the group in a sing along of American standards including old man river. Oh, we strain yourself. Nobody knows the trouble I've seen and America the beautiful. What no Led Zeppelin to his it says undoubtedly the worst place on earth is Moscow went there for a conference and the people like to be the most obnoxious ever anywhere. Service we got my scondolas. How do you like that that old man river sounds like they did. We had that one night at the macaroni grill member that right. Schufer was up there on the table with those shoes that were like four sizes too big like the like what's his name. What was that name of the waiter and like how's your full on me in the made. I don't know this hundred years ago. It'll come to me remember when he came with those shoes. Yeah, a fact or no no no. And I'm not talking about that Robin Williams remake. We're talking about the real one like Kaja full. These generate. 560 pound five 60 on the AT and T and Verizon wireless line WQAM. QAM. Hey, are you doing body. Okay sir. Are you sitting down? I'm I'm strapped in. All right, buddy. 10,000 150 was announced to 10. No. Yeah, that's right. That's pretty good. Okay, thanks a lot, pal. Oh, I heard Dr. Rackens died. Yeah, he did. 560 pound five 60 on the AT and T and Verizon wireless line. I think that's actually pretty good number for the Milwaukee Brewers. A non-edity of team, which of course is owned by the. The commissioner baseball with nobody can figure that out. It's got interest in one of the teams that he's commissioner. Make too much sense to me. But nevertheless, it's all corrupt anyway. WQAM. Yeah, hi. Yes sir. I just want to make to make a couple comments. And you know about North Korea and. And our act. Yeah. Oh, is this deal? Yeah. Oh, I knew. I knew you'd catch on. I love you. I just want to say I love you. But I want to make a comment. It's kind of funny. Jim John, you'll have come out and said basically he doesn't. You know, share what we say. He's going to make nuclear weapons. But you know, really thought it was not even though he is a dirt bag. And it's come back. You know, we're saying he was going to, you know, file, make nuclear weapons and stuff like that. And it's at us. And now I'm not know what was the mass destruction in that country. And on which is even said that the information is broken. It's at the United States, you know, games. But they don't want to attack North Korea. What's up with that? Why don't they want to do this? Because if they attack North Korea, that the blue like five six million people in Seoul will be dead on the first day. That's probably why. Okay, because I, and I just don't understand there. How they can go after a country that we conquered him. Why don't you, you don't understand. That's the reason they picked it. Just like a way we've been telling you for weeks now that they were going to a game plan to pick on a country that had two-thirds of its army already annihilated. That had no defenses to speak. I mean, we could go in there in a couple of weeks or three weeks, whatever it was. And just blow right through there. And of course, now the obvious question is, now that we're there, what the hell do we do with the mess that we made that we've got left? Right, because we got about five or six, the 10 different times of people. How are you going to bring all those people together? And how does she, how you majority is like, totally up in arms, we want to stop. And they underestimated the she, I stringed over there. What are they going to do now to bring that country together? So they don't have the same mess gone like they did not win in the early 80s. Just keep in mind, we liberated them so they could do all these grotesques. They're doing right now. We liberated them so they could turn the country into religious, nothing up like that. But better than Franklin Graham. And we're to tell you before the show that Pat Robertson has come out and said, For a strong, we want to get to the world. We put in a secular state in Iraq. We don't want North theocracy. They're like in Iran. We want to have a secular state because if we had a theocracy that would keep him in his Christian Fanatics out, he don't want to part that. He's already salivating, rubbing his hands together. Waiting to get his hands on all those Dinaras. Just like remember, looking for him free Dinaras when he gets up here. No chance, the rumor. No shot. Tomorrow's D Day, man. This is the day tomorrow's the day the rumors are showing up up here. Oh, god. So if I'm not here tomorrow morning when you come in, I'll just shoot the show. You'll know I'm just hiding. Either I got stars or I'm hiding or both. I think there's a much better chance I'm going to hiding. And oh, I got a great idea. Yeah. Yeah, if I get that phone call, I don't want to mention no names. But if I get a certain phone call from a certain somebody, I might say, I'm having trouble breathing. And like that, you know. That might get the job done. Maybe these respiratory problems. I got a bad headache. And I just took my temperature. It's about 152 in a shade.

Because as usual, I wasn't paying a lot of attention. I was getting prepared for whatever crap I was going to do here. But it sounded to me like it was a promo for the draft day festivities on QM this Saturday. Right. Here we go. Which is correct. The promo that we're running or this inside information that allegedly is going to be a memo inside of building. Good question. Hey, go up those checkered pants. Yeah. I'll drop there with checkered pants. I'll people laugh about it or the joint. That's it. Well, I guess you'll have to tune in Saturday to find out. Of course Friday when a book comes out, he might now want to show us face and public on Saturday. You never know. We're asking today on theorodgers.com. And what city would you find the most obnoxious people? Based on my experience with those Philadelphia sports fans. And I use that term very loosely because they are obnoxious. They're disgusting. They're boisterous. They're out of controller assholes. Paris. Let's see. Well, Miami just tied Paris for for 74. New York 55. Bokeh 45. Bokeh. I got to wish we had that song. And then it's way down to Philadelphia 16. DC force. God, it's not stellar as old as God. One Detroit one. And no votes for Atlanta or Amasco yet. I thought we'd get a much more diverse list than this when you. I think. But we just star audience just don't get around that much. Here's a facts from Maria who is not a chronic. By the way, she says I don't want to be a chronic. The person who factually did that we were guarding the beast after the hurricane game. At the game. I'm hearing your reaction since then. My friend called me this morning and jokingly asked me if I'm able to sleep and I'd after dropping the dime on the beast. If you dropped the dime on him it would bounce but that's about all. You know how many yards it would probably bounce? I've just thought you should know that I'm not hurtless. I do kind of feel bad. Don't feel bad, Maria. Just think it's a shame he lost all that way 62 pounds he doesn't have the will part of continue. Especially since all the food he is to eat to lose the way this prepared for him. It should be a no brainer. Here he's getting all of this great food for free. They've been bringing it right to his door. We've been talking about him making him the star the centerpiece. He doesn't want to lose it. I know the difference. Believe me. This is a young man with a death wish. He doesn't want to lose it. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. In addition to which he doesn't understand anything about credibility. He doesn't care about our sponsor. He doesn't care about his own credibility. If I came on here, I said, I'm not 140 pounds on balance for life. If I did that and I showed up in town when I'm going to be back in a few weeks. And then what happened? You'll find it? Did you gain it all back? How can you do that? To be showing up at the ball game and at the Rascal house. I'll never forgive him for that. Forget about eating. They're just even showing up there. I mean Robert Greeper. That's a perfect place for Greeper. Okay. Professional self-hating Jew. Who's an oldie at the in training? Oh, brother. Perfect place for him. Huh? Maybe he was by. That's not relevant. Okay. We're not talking about Rimmer. We're talking about the adult. She says, I hope for his sake he gets it together. So I hope so too. But I'm, I'm, I'm, I've watched my hands of it. I can't, I can't use this show as like a reform school for a perfect fat people to rest in my life. Can't do it. You really let us down. Okay. And in addition to which you're always right. You're unprofessional in those broadcasts and I hear you. We got too many children on your QM. That's the problem. It's like, it's like a broadcasting school. It's like the QM that, that did that we play. That's why everybody likes it so much because it's true. It's true. I'm not saying that they're on, I mean, like, letting him our test. He's a good guy, but it's true. He can't speak either. Let him our test. And he knows it. He knows he can't speak. That was here we're doing on the air. Am I right? He knows it doesn't stop and but it's true. It's true. It isn't the true. Yes. God, almighty, what a place. But, you know, you're going to have a whole bunch of flunkies around a work cheap. Like, you know, clearance. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5 has duped in and yet would get these a contract. Not with the contract, but he did pop in to say hi and give me, you know, doctor's report. A doctor's report has even to the doctor. He's been to the doctor. Oh, my God. I told you where, uh, a beater boy got sick for, oh, how do you want to know what he's got? He's got a shave chest at this. At this point. I don't want to hear about this chest. That's the last thing. I want to even think about it. I have a second close. Oh, no. Makes me think around Jeremy all over again. He got a shave chest. He had an EKG as at it. Yes. And, and he's just fine. No, buddy. He's starting to get a real, uh, neurotic, uh, what do they call it? Hypocondria? Hi, but that's the one I'm looking for. Hypocondria. I think I'm going to come back this weekend in the show up Monday morning. Unexpected and just breathing. I just came from Toronto. Oh, that's it. Watching him run like a son of a bitch. I'm kidding. Yeah. So what was the problem? He was at the doctor this morning again. He spent an awful lot of time at the doctors. Yeah. Well, you can't be, uh, you know, relax. We might have to like isolate him for a while. Might have to put him out in a rubber room again for a couple of months. Just so everybody else can be safe. Look, we did a more beater boy. Because I did like, I think he loved me. That big lump on his neck. That was that a freedom kiss. 560560 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line WQAM. QAM, hello. Yes, sir. QAM?

Yeah, because I went out there to see if any of the powers that be know the answer. The powers that P.S. To that question about Mo and the draft and everything like that. And they're all in a big promotions meeting. So there was no one to talk to. A promotions meeting. Yeah, WQM. A promotions meeting. Right. Now is Doreen playing pivotman and a submitting? Huh? These are the meetings where they tell Miguel to take that big prize machine out. Way more often because that's why the promotions events suck because the prize machine is out there. Speaking of sucking, the rumor around the building was and it drifted all the way up here, wafted by the fact machine. The only reason we got those trips to give away on that hot couple's contest was because finally after being pressured for how many years has it been now. Miguel had a service Doreen to squeeze those scripts out of him. That's what I'm hearing. What the good thing he's in that meeting, not hearing that. All the way, we do like Doreen lots since he got into what was Mo. See, and again, if it was just me, like that chick, guy's called in the United Clock Hour. You know, you and his small. What kind of person is he to pick on? He's a sad old fart.

I mean, I think we put like, if we made it into like a local dispute, you don't want to mean like avid toura and all my cities more obnoxious than yours is plantation, yet whatever. Well, there's something for another day, maybe. No, I'm not going to pittle around with that sophomore kind of crap. Talk about, uh, for real. In fact, isn't that what they want to see?

Crazy. The beach gone for Lauderdale. The father of spring break. What was his name? Crazy. Cool. Ah, geez. I must have been off that week or something.

Miami 96 per. 85 New York 64, Volcan 54, Philadelphia 18, DC 5. And that's it. The other ones either have one or none. I've never been able to figure out the ones that have none because people call them in and then they don't vote for. Well, maybe those people don't have a pewter, you know. Anyway, this is interesting. I think the Palm Beach troublemaker for Faxing Listen. It says as luck would have it, this is from the LA Weekly. A 911 victim testifies that the carnage could have been averted. Mindy Kleinberg began by telling a befalde in the northeast so warm and clear that she literally skipped home after seeing off her 10 year old in 70 year old at the school bus stop. On that day September 11, 2001, her 38 year old husband a stock trader with catarphid steerled in the World Trade Center lost his life along with some 3000 others net days terrorist attacks. Kleinberg testified last week before the National Luck, this is 11-mile 2 weeks ago. Before the National Commission investigated in 911, the Commission took two days of testimony just blocks away from ground zero, hearing both from survivors and from experts who spoke of the hijackers financial sources and US intelligence lapses. Although Kleinberg's husband was unlucky, it wasn't bad luck that cost his life she asserted, Kleinberg detailed the good luck of the hijackers who could have been stopped at many points. Most of her account is fully documented, so allocations away to investigation. And it has here excerpts from Mindy Kleinberg's statement. It has been said that the intelligence agencies have to be right a 100% of the time and the terrorist only have to get lucky once. The 911 terrorist weren't just lucky once, they were lucky over and over again allowing the illustrate. The SEC. The terrorist lucky streak began the week before 911 when the security has changed Commissioner SEC. The SEC in concert with the US intelligence agencies has sophisticated software programs that are used in real time to watch both domestic and overseas. The SEC out trends that may indicate a prisoner future crime. On the Chicago Board of Options exchanged during the week before 911, put options were purchased on American NEA and airlines that two airlines involved in the attacks. The investors who placed these orders were gambling met in the short term, the stock prices of both airlines would plummet. Never before on the Chicago Exchange were such large amounts of United and American Airlines options traded. These investors needed a profit of at least $5 million after 911 attacks. Interestingly, the names of these investors remain underscored and the $5 million remains unclamed. While were these aggrant trades not discovered prior to 911, who were the individuals who placed these trades had been investigated. The INS. Prior to 911, our US intelligence agency should have stopped the 19 terrorist remembering this country. What does it say? The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. The US is a little bit more than a year ago. Push him off, Carlos. How is it possible that the National Military Command Center located in the Pentagon in a contact with law enforcement and traffic controllers from 848am did not communicate to the Secretary of Defense also with the Pentagon about the other hijack planes, especially the one headed to Washington? How is that possible? The President, on the morning of 911 President Bush was scheduled to listen to elementary school children read, before the President walked in the classroom, and had sufficient information that the plane that hit the world trade center was hijacked. At that time, they also acknowledged that two other commercial airliners in the year were also hijacked. It would seem that the National Emergency was in progress. Yet President Bush was allowed to enter a classroom full of young children and listen to the students read. Why did the Secret Service inform him of this National Emergency? Maybe they thought it was going to be a learning experience. In the case of a National Emergency's second of indecision could cost thousands of lives, is it luck that Aberen Stock Trade weren't monitored? Is it luck that 15 visas are awarded based on incomplete forms? Is it luck that airline security screenings allow hijackers to board planes with box cutters and pepper spray? Is it luck that emergency FAA in order to protect the land? Is it luck that a National Emergency is not reported to top government officials on a timely basis? To me, luck is something that happens once. When you have this repeated pattern of broken protocols, broken laws, broken communication, one cannot still call it luck. If it's simple, we don't look to hold these individuals accountable for not doing their jobs properly, then hopefully these spectators are not to get lucky again. And that's why I'm here with you all today, she said because you must find the answers to what happened that day, so it was to ensure that another 9-11 cannot happen again. And this was part of her testimony from a Congress about two weeks ago. I'd be like that. Mindy Kleinberg, who says that died in the WTC. Sorry about that missing page, and there aren't we George. Well, they tried to do a good job. They'll refactor them, sure. They'll refactor them, and then we'll stick it in there. They were not depending on this Rick Santorum thing has got a lot of people really porked off. I don't know why I should surprise anybody. That's why when it was first vaccinated here on Monday, I just looked at it and thought I'm more the same crap, same old, same old. Rick Santorum, Senator of Pennsylvania, Republican Senator of Pennsylvania, thanks to homo's our bad. He says that the Supreme Court says that you have the right to consensual gay sex within your home, and you have the right to dig a me. You have the right to plug a me. You have the right to insist. You have the right to adultery. You have the right to anything Santorum said in his AP interview, which was published on Monday. Gay groups were quick to denounce in terms of comments. The latest in the series of divisive remarks by some lawmakers. Senator Santorum's arms are deeply hurtful and play on deep seated fears that flying the face of scientific evidence. Common sense and basic decency. Clearly there's no camp compact in his conservatism. When he stackled birth political director for the human rights campaign, the nation's largest gay and disc-economic advocacy group. He called for quick and decisive action by Republican leaders to repeat the eight-cent terms of marks, and of course he's still waiting. The Democratic Senator of campaign committee called on Santorum to resign as Chairman of the Republican Senate caucus, the number three position in the GOP leadership. GB-Train Tratt-Lot-A-Rit-San-Torum. This conservative compassion is just, what is it? Out of control, compact and conservative, but it had a call it. In a statement released yesterday, Santorum didn't dispute the accuracy of the quote, but criticized the AP's deraise misleading. He said his comment was specific to the pending Supreme Court case. I'm a firm believer that all are equal under the constitution. He said, my comment should not be construed anyways, a statement on individual lifestyles, but according to unended excerpts of the tip to be released late Tuesday by the AP, Santorum spoke at a length about homosexuality, made it clear he did not approve of acts outside of traditional heterosexualations of acts. Just like any of you used to say, it's not the sin that bothers us. It's not the sinner that we hate it to the sin. Remember those days? Yeah. We used to be thrown out the orange juice by the gallon every time she'd say that. We love the sinner we hate the sin. He doesn't approve of acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships. In the April 7th interview, Santorum describes homosexual acts as a threat to society and a family. I have no problem with homosexualities and I have a problem with homosexuality. Same old crap, same old, same old. Democrats waited on the early remarks throughout the day, sent him minority of the year time, national, so the sentiments expressed by Santorum of our own out of step with our country's respect for tolerance. One presidential contender tried to draw the White House in the controversy. The White House speaks the rhetoric of compassion and conservatism, but there's silent while their chief lieutenant's make divisive and hurtful comments that have no place in our politics, said Senator John Kerry, who was kind of scary from Massachusetts. How do you like them apples? But like I said, same old stuff, nothing surprising there. So these guys are a bunch of bigots. Is anybody surprised? No, we already knew that. Kiltson, good time though. Yeah. Twelve minutes passed 11 at 5.60. WCM got our big noon to one comedy that's our noon. Then we got the man dog at one. We got the hump or come along.

I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, all the time. Oh, yes, sir. I got reem, I'm so sorry, Mike. I know, I'm sorry. Right up. Get there, you folks. Reemers, come in here. Get me some stuff you're covering with us. What's my hell you doing? But, you're the drainage system, Bob. Our drainage system? Yeah, you know, a system of automation, natural drainage, and this is used in trade-offs because water... I know what a drainage system is, Reemers! I don't need a drainage system in my office for heaven's sake. I don't even have a water bottle. I, sir. Yes, sir. I'll buy the way out. We got the ad. How did the Oscars go? Oh, funny you should ask, guys. Now that's my next topic. Was it an amazing time? What the hell? Go ahead, finish it. Are you doing this? Are you doing the made? Put me on stage with Jennifer Garner from Ali. Well, we figured such she's on ABC. I, you know what? I figured I'd do it just for the hell that it'd be fun. I figured I'd get a little action afterwards. You know what she says to me? I'm married. I can't do that. You're my boss. I don't want to throw down that rock.

Are you doing the made? Well, also, how did it go with Jennifer? It did, sir. I got nothing. Nothing. Nothing. You wouldn't even give me a hand. Well, so you are a married man. I know what. You sound like mini. I don't want homes. I'm sorry. I'm saying it, Jennifer. Go on up. You're lovely. So much wanted to come in earlier. I said I don't want a mirror, mini. I just want a camera. Reemers. Reemers. What are you doing? Get the crew off. I'll get your crew out of here. I hear you. How about how? Are you doing the make? I'm a 20. Hope all those good log Republicans, of course they wouldn't be listening to the show. I hope that they're really proud of Senator Rickson's former public in a Pennsylvania. Home of Fovin Chief. I hope they're really proud of their support for George W. and the right wing and self-hating leanings. I'm talking about all those log cabin Republicans, those self-hating fags from coast to coast. All those columnist, all those internet mavens, like Miss Grudge and all those other people that the Prancer on and Jade Groove result dresses in private. I hope they're real thrilled and excited and squeezing themselves in each other. To see what a bunch of homophobic, bigoted, narrow minded. I'm not just born again, Bible thumping in the end with those they're in bed with. Oh, I shouldn't say that. Here's a fact that says Los Angeles must be the most obnoxious city in the world. I don't agree with that. Has fuel and Dr. Phil? Are you sure? Tim and Sue Martin and Keepard, Charlton and Dr. Laura, etc. If you still disagree, maybe we can take a meeting. It says, now we're not taking a meeting. I don't, of course, I've been there in a long time. You've been there. Yeah, but nothing's I was. Yeah. I always found a people there to be extremely friendly and it was a really neat place. Of course, that's a long time ago. Back when there were still some people there were, you know, who weren't professional comics. Well, it's kind of a different place now. I kind of a different place. But I don't agree with that about Los Angeles. I wouldn't even put it on the list. Do you think now? That would be like putting Los Vegas on list. Does it make any sense? Makes sense to you? Nope. And so, there are friendly, most of those places, and there are friendly because it's good for business. That's what it's all about. They're in a service business. They're in a tourist business. As opposed to South Florida, which is supposed to be in the tourist business, but in the business of hate. Hate and hostility. We don't watch it here. Go away. Go back where you came from. That's, that's the message. We should put up a big bunch of billboards as you're coming down. I.95 and I.75 to pin that word for months. You came. And so, here's a message from South Florida. If you're coming here, turn around and go back. We don't watch it. How are you spelled? Like that. How do you spell it? Like that? Like that? Like that? Like that? Here's a fact that says, please note that any city in the world would large population of New Yorkers qualifies to be on a poll day with the acceptance in New York City as much as I hate to admit it in New York City New York obnoxiousness works. I understand that. That's a good point. Because it's so big and so crowded and you have to be pushy in the area. I do get the message there. But unfortunately, when so many of those people come and they stick out like a sore thumb and places like South Florida and in Pittsburgh and in Nashville, like my landlady in Nashville was two months back in 1980s, said to me, there's two kinds of people in this world. There's people from Nashville and then there's people from New York in Florida, which was code for Jews. Anyways, is this being said, and all my travels, no city comes close to Paris for every of the most obnoxious native people. And I agree. They are disgusting, man. The frogs. I didn't even know I did vote for my army just to go along with you. Perus will be my second close choice. And in fact, I think if I were to spend more time than just two days in Paris, I would probably have to agree. But I would never spend more than two days in Paris ever again. Not just obnoxious and unfriendly, but slabs and they just throw all their garbage on the streets and it just awful, horrible, nasty, miserable, scummy people. Even though it was a look good. In what city would you find the most obnoxious people? Miami, 114. By the way, if mob comes in at Romany, more make sure you wear the Sergio Man's Carlos until you heal up from whatever he's giving you to late. How about they get money? Where anyway? Yeah, don't let him in. Plus they don't want to give us the straight. They're not. They're not in any meeting right now. That's just bullcraft. They're just hiding because we're trying to get the real fancy. They're just stolen. They don't want us to put on the year to real story about what's going to happen Saturday with a draft business. That Mo keeps insisting he's not going to show. He's going to be a no-mo show. 114. Say, Miami, 100 perus, we got a battle on our hands there. New York 75. Boca 61. I think for a town how many people live in Boca? I think for a town as small as Boca, I haven't 61 votes as pretty impressive. Notice how I matched your pause with my own pregnant pause. Oh, thank you. Appreciate that. Take the heat off. It'll help you. 21. DC 5. Uh, not Taylor as long as he's got a pair now. Detroit's got one at land. He's got one. Grinica could go one. My scone on have any. Vienna, Austin. I don't have one. And Oakland, California. You don't have one yet. But he's right about the way to fans. The only thing I was the Iber are less than Oakland was that pair under where a Denys. Yeah. Yeah. I kind of a schmitty experience. I've opened many, many years ago. Well, it was one of those things. You know, and what better place than I ever tended to story about the flood in the Denys in Orlando, I created? No, I don't think you have the real flush. I'd remember that. Oh, yeah. This was at a Denys in Orlando. I can't remember what that was doing there. But I stopped in there and used the T room in Denys to take a. Greg Reed. And unfortunately, for what I guess the person who had seen, I've learned the lesson out when you go to a place where there's like toilet paper gym always flushed to clear out what's in the bowl before you sit down. Yeah. You see what I'm saying? Was there a accumulation? And it's the plummings and all that great. You could wind up with a seat over. And in this particular case, the word was not a seat over, but a flood. So needless to say, as I waddle out the door there, I mean, I made a run for because you could see the water start to come out from underneath the door. And I made a vline for that car and headed for the vline expressway or whatever. I'll let it go. Good idea. Now I got out of there. And of course, I needless to say, I never went back there. So I have no idea what you know what to deal was. But can you even imagine? In a Denys hall. Although probably the reaction would have been didn't spell the worst in usual. 26, past 11. Here on grand grand, grand, slalom radio. I didn't even read a facts about you. Would they like somebody likes you? I know. One. Yesterday early in the show, guy called to take a shot at Georgie City was a quasi-intellectual. 75% of Georgia show is sex and perversion. A nice diversion for some of us. I think what the guy we wanted to say is, George makes me mad because he's not a whack over-lidges-zine is freak like me. He then called again today. Please stop the screenless GF. Please give up the good work, George. We will not stop the screenless. Oh, no. I'm enjoying it. And what's his name, Carlos? He can ask you the phone. Anyway, he's got that big thing blocking his neck. I think he can't get the phone close to his neck. I don't think he put your phone here when you got this big or lump. This lump that must be. Besides, he'll infect it if he actually uses it. I'll take it one thing. You're lucky you got it from off and not from Andrews Asson Woods because I understand well. 27 after 11 at 560 WQM.

Here's some of my favorite fields quotes. First prize, one we can fill it up. The second prize, two we can fill it up you. Last week I went to fill it up you, but it was closed. And fill it up you, a cemetery would light. I thought that was Miami. I thought it was South Florida. We have lights. And then Rob said, lots of light. Positive things can be said. A Grace Kelly, Kim Delaney, Ben Franklin, Noon, Tromsky, and Bill, Bill, Crossby. Oh, Bill, Cosby. I thought said, Bill, Crossby. What's positive about Bill Cosby? I can't stand those yellow spots. The Cosby kids. Oh, police, police. I get weak between a knees. I heard that name Bill Cosby. He was got an I spy before you were born with Robert Culp. That was a good show. I saw it. And then he started trying to be a comedian and a Bill Cosby show. And people like Tom Jacob would tell you, oh, that's what everybody in America watched the Cosby show. No, I did not watch the Bill Cosby show was awful. Hey, you're just ripping chicken because you got under your skin. The Huxtables. And you know any black post name, the Huxtables? No. Yeah.

Just like you were saying about the, uh, evening news last night presenting the Shiite, uh, uprisings and all that stuff. Oh, this is great. Now these people have been repressed and they are free now. Yeah, this is great. They love it. We don't know whether this scream or throw a banana at this point. They're, uh, banging themselves on the chest and they, why they want to run a goddamn place. Right. And they're good. We're saying, ah, Shiite. Man, we don't know what they'll do now. So typical. So freaking typical. Children held at Camp X-ray U.S. admitted myths. U.S. military has revealed its holding juveniles at its high security prisons for terrorists at Guantanamo Bay and Cuban owners camp X-ray. The commander of the joint task force of Gitmo, major general, Jeffy Miller said more than one child on the age of 16 is at the detention center. Don't let the Catholic church find out. Can you imagine the line of priesthood like a volunteer to go to Gitmo right to minister to them to get Mo. However, major general, uh, Miller has revealed a little more about their welfare. He says the U.S. is holding juvenile enemy combatants at the center confirming rumors of children being held, but he's refused to reveal how many there are the exact ages of the countries of origin. And whether or not they'd like to volunteer to be altar boys. He says they're being well cared for in a kept in facility separate to adult prisoners, but children are still being interrogated will continue to be held at Gitmo. There are about 660 prisoners in the camp. They've not been tried to convicted of any offense, but are being held as part of what the U.S. calls its war on terror. They're just being held indefinitely. And other just there in a holding pattern. And like our tool to be for the show, the aroma from there must be. Really walking through the earth.

And this pool today went over like a pregnant pool vault. Or at the equator in the middle of August. Wow. Miami? Huh? Not great. They don't like the pool. Miami 129. Paris 116. New York 82. Bolka 78. Topad Alphay a 21. DC 5. And everybody else small potatoes. And they are forming at the mouth here about the WH. Oh! The clearing of this is a what they call it? They were getting a travel alert. Tainted. Yeah. Tainted and painted. Well. What? Did you? Yeah. And there are some. I think they really pissed off because at least got the crap kicked out of them in fully last night. That's what they're really upset about. I don't have to do with the sun is stuff. The fact that a matter of ways the hotel is here. Our empty man. You can probably get a dollar a holler for a room for like a week. It's pretty, pretty lame. And there's nothing going on. That's a sad part. But you know, people tend to be just a little bit on the panicky side. Then we're going to be a little bit nervous. Just like all the nervous nellies out there. All these bush guys. You know, oh, I sure wouldn't get out of play not after 9-11. Remember that? Yeah, of course. I mean, well, what is that all about? Doesn't bother me. And of course, now you have to go through a whole by. I'll say this when I came up here this last time. Mm-hmm. Security at my international. They just about do a cavity search. I mean, it is really pretty thorough. Some of the people seem to be enjoying it a lot. I'm Tonya. We're here all the weapons of mass destruction. We're gonna do destruction and odors go on this from the nation. It's on our website today by David Korn. You<|tr|>- I'm not gonna read the whole thing, I don't wanna do a lot of burnt times to rest up, plus we're getting such a tremendous response on a phone today. Look at that. I, I say it. Well, look, it's just, it's just a way it is. Like, I was honest about it, or just bbitting our time until Friday at 11 30 Guitar Nammoring. The winter book is going to come out. I mean, there are a lot of shoes are going to drop and then of course as usual at an coloredους not going to have it. Nothing to make sense. The latest corn rights, the obvious question is where are the weapons of mass destruction that supposedly prompted the Bush-Chainee Rum-Sold Wolfowitz Quartet to invade Iraq? The less obvious one is, where's the massive search and secure operation that should be scouring Iraq to locate and control those stocks of chemical and biological weapons in WMD related materials technology and records? The US military certainly has been looking for chemical and biological weapons as well as evidence of a nuclear bomb program, Iraq was never said to be in possession of nuclear weapons. What is surprising if not scandalous is that two weeks after US troops moved into Baghdad, the Bush Pentagon has not yet mounted a full sweep of Iraq for WMD or even dispatched the sufficient amount of train troops and specialists to conduct such a mission? It's as if the Bush administration in the Pentagon hadn't bothered listening their own rhetoric about Iraq's reported weapons and mass destruction while planning the invasion of occupation. Shouldn't a mess of these units have been scramming across Iraq using all that pre-war intelligence that allowed administration officials to declare without pause that Saddam Hussein controlled enough of these dangerous weapons to be a director to the US within days of not hours of the collapse of Hussein's murderous regime? It reminds me of that emotional speech of colon palma and they were all yawning you're recallt the UN and he had to die grams and of course they were the American that were so hyperventilating especially Fox they were like squirting all over the goddamn cameras they were so excited. And he was showing a map and he heard this location and we know that they've got the Syrian gas hidden here in VxOV and they had the locations allegedly all locked it on a map. Everybody else said oh yeah sure. Those are like those old diagrams here to the Chinese embassy and where would it have was right. Where would it have was it? Pagil Hussival. Huh? Don't you remember that they were sorry it was a mistake. They must have known something about that SARS gonna start. So anyway I get you to a doctor right away Carlis. You know, Greg's hopped his head and during that last break. He popped him in. Yeah. Wearing one of those surgical masks. You know something in his case, excellent idea. If there's anybody who needs not to pull out the rest of the people in the building with his disease, that's the guy right there. And you're supposed to laugh. Greg Hussival. Yeah. By the way, Mr. Macho Greg you're down there hiding okay with a mask on. I'm sitting here at Toronto. Right in the middle it's supposed to be the SARS capital north America. Not worried about it one little bit. Okay. Not even a tiny little teeny tiny bit. I gotta go scrub my hands now. But I'm not worried about it. There's Mayor Mel. So if I can. I'll maybe you can. He's in bed shape. So don't get that hepatitis A. 5605060 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. We got that big big noon to one hour coming up. It's going to be good. I'm going to like work out some good stuff. Okay. Just like yesterday through in a lot of stuff we haven't played in very, very long time. I enjoyed it tremendously. We got the man. And I like to know who was saying all those bills. Okay. Well, we'll find out for you. Have a great day. Teller more time Randy's on a word is on the dial. So what was she saying about the muck being institutionalized? I don't know. She just thought that's what she said. 560505060 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Who I would point out has been instrumental in supporting us all along the way. But at this point we are developing this plan so that when we get information from Dr. Bessert. And this time's getting dumped on man. All because of one crappy hockey game, you know. Right up until this moment. Nobody was making a big stimulus about it. Even people don't know what that means. Let's see. Scott says I'm in Penelis Park now and I continue that's a Tampa Bay where he has the most of muck's. How come Tampa didn't get on there? I don't know. Well, let's get on there right away. Beiner boy. Get in touch with your parry or partner and crime there. Tell me get Tampa on there like. Ponto. Wouldn't that be a great team song for the most show? Give my piece of chance. Yeah, that's our feelings about Tampa. Kiss you haven't heard it. It says toothless redness with their rusted out pickup trucks cover with Rumble flag stickers. Jesus fish and gun racks and number three stickers. They make the old fart. They make the old fart. Whatever that means. It says I miss Tamarack compared to Scott and it's got he's got a Jewish last name. Scott. You made the wrong move there. Scott, you took a wrong turn at the overpass in the other pass. Beiner boy should have pointed in the other direction. Even making a sharp right at the beaches of big improvement over going to Tampa Bay. WQIM. Hello. Yes sir. Hey, and the how you doing? Great. Listen, we've been my friend. We were waiting for the movie calling for column blind to come out on video. Yeah. It was supposed to be released today at block. August. They postponed it. The block bus ran kind of release a period but it's not going to be to logist. I was told because they're going to release it in the theaters. I didn't know that because we it was on the board for I don't know for for a while. And well, why was on the board at blockbuster? Yeah, as that's to be released today. So so then we have really no reason to assume that their gun will censor it because the release was delayed to logist because they're going to release it in the theaters one more time. Okay. Well, I wasn't on my the first time hearing about it. So so before we jump on somebody called about this the other day too. Before we jump down blockbuster's drugs, which I'm not a fan. There's anyway. But before we do that let's wait and see what happens at August. Okay. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. You're out. He's done. Could you tell me was done? I think he was done.

Before about how we enjoyed George from and talking about sex and deviant stuff. I'm glad you enjoyed it in the past. Don't expect that this summer or any other time soon. I'm just warning them ahead of time. If they're expecting you to come on and talk about eating asnes of no mole. No. No mole. Nothing but politics and religion from that one. Nothing but very not. Just read the daily weekly reader or something like that. Because now that we're under this new way of jeem up there in Washington man. We can't even take a good crap much less say crap on a year. Maybe one last time. One last time. That's it. Don't do it again. Because they really got their nose to the era to the speaker. Just wait and see who's naughty and I saw it so no more than that.

Anyway, our poll today in what city will you find the most obnoxious people, maybe, and more of course is in, uh, he lives in Boca. Miami 175, Paris 148, New York 109, Boca 97.

Greenwich Connecticut's got a pair. Oakland's got two. Tampa, which is just gone on there a moment ago is got a pair. My sky one and Vienna Austria. I guess we can even get that guy out of computer. Or at least maybe a Vini sausage. Speaking of sausage, we got the mad dogs. Jim Manage, you're one to Humphor at three this afternoon. Bye bye bye! Bye bye!
