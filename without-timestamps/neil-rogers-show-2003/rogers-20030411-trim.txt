bit him on a cheek 918 at 560 WAM okay here's the pull question today let's get with it okay because yesterday we did it and look at how we were like only about 1200 votes on there that's okay for an overnight pull but we've been moving way up in the world over that you know 14 a day right definitely I mean especially since George is out this week I mean now I'll be starting picking on him again you should hear what Carlos was saying about him before the show today just ripped him an ass can help myself yeah well you were true where everything you said was right now here's the pull question today who do you think has the biggest ego and we need some help from the audience on this because I don't have a long list and somebody made a good point to it it was yesterday morning when I was talking about I played the course 11 times and I you know he's played the twice the broadcast 11 times from Augusta welcome congratulations get a life as Jennifer Ramwood say you know who cares did you have said it again today no I wasn't listening that wasn't paying attention to him this I was waiting in fact yeah I didn't hear what he said I talked about was Michael Michael motorcycle Michael Jordan this you know come on already it's old stuff we had the hockey playoff last night a triple overtime and a high mupsets Detroit of course Detroit lost the first two to Vancouver last night and then one for in a row but and then of course say Louis shuts out fan cover six nothing right there in Vancouver BC it must have smoked too much of that good stuff I'm gonna be gonna hold some bad stuff and he's on her a Michael list and Michael and so he was self-aggrandizing again so he's the first name on list more Howard David and biggest ego Steve Mr. ego Kane Neil Rogers I put myself on here even though I have no ego and that's the free control if I did I'd be glad to tell you although this is a great show George Rodriguez and that was Carlos's being a boy suggesting yesterday's a put George on there he's got a real swell to it Donald Rumsfeld paramongering junior definitely got a gigantic and a scary ego I mean he's frightening and Hank Goldberg I put him on there just you know because people are taking shots at Hank and plus he never came in here and discussed hockey with me huh and that's all I got I mean can you think of anybody any well-known person that's got a massive ego that thinks there's stuff don't stink there's gotta be a whole bunch of don't say because that'll take the fun away from the audience they like building these pools but we'll get to when we feel like it because I got a lot of good stuff here man but this story really frost my ass more GI wives get host casualty calls camped old capital in California wives of camped old and rains involved in the war in Iraq have been receiving crank calls from individuals claiming to work for the red cross who regretfully and falsely informed that they're spouse of a kid killed an action I'm tongue-tied because I just can't believe it yeah right very funny in a statement camped old and remind room my military families that genuine casual notifications are not made by phone or by the red cross individual's falsely identifying themselves as red cross representatives have made prank calls to camped old and spouses claiming that their loved ones overseas have been killed the Marine Corps does not utilize the red cross for casual notification Marine Corps and Navy representatives conduct all casual notification in person for camped old and I honestly can't even fathom some of that would that mentality Marine wife named judy at all the San Diego Union tribune yesterday I can't even go there in my mind I would assume a young spouse could believe that kind of call and her world could be shattered just six six six six six six six man frost my ass also if you want to have your ass frosted to those of you people like only selected images you know the ones that make you reinforce whatever you want to believe I mean we saw the thing with a dragon the a statue down couple of days ago and we even did a play by play on it here we had some fun with it I was it was great you couldn't help but be impressed with that but that's only part of it soon go to the aradju's dot com today only if you have a strong stomach if you're if you're grossed out by a very graphic images of the truth of what reality is then don't look at that just skip that part where we got all those pictures gruesome gruesome horrendous uh oh and then we also have thanks to a beiner boy a list of all the names of American POWs and casualties name age where they're from so we can put a name behind and in other words make it real as opposed to just having to be a statistic on a paid somewhere you know one out of a hundred or whatever the hell members eventually gonna be anyway here's a facts from Paul and Fort Myers who says he wanted to suggest Beverly Hill believes for the list yesterday we left that out sorry Paul you're you're right that would have been great huh see what I see what the deep south is all about if I see what about 60 percent of America's read all about all those red states you know around the ages the red states come on east uh oh the high cost of bush bashing got a couple of stories about that Joanne your grapholo's relentless bashing and with that college Joanne jenine whatever name is jenine grapholo's relentless bashing a president bush just might have doomed her ABC sitcom reports the New York post grapholo said to play producer but TV news magazine on slice alive but ABC's been deluge with calls and emails from viewers threatening to boycott the network and its advertisers if this comes on a schedule we don't wish to see the faces of liberal Hollywood especially those that provided a hidden comfort to saw the mucane one protester john alfarez email ABC one of your people probably a beiner will stand up and fight for a right to request of exclusion from the shows and sponsors that seek our attention ABC reps had no comment grapholo declared to the Washington post in January one of her many outbursts there was a manufactured conflict for the sake of geopolitical dominance and on and on she went there's no evidence of weapons of mass destruction and so far she seems to be a correct nevertheless don't confuse these people of the truth and certainly i don't let her express herself and stung by anti-work criticism from tim robins and Susan surman and here here again talk about blue nose assholes the baseball hall of fame has canceled a 50th anniversary celebration of the film bolder on that was to feature the co-stars bunch of blue nose assholes hall president Dale patrassky senator to robins and surranded this week same festivities April 26 and 7th of chupers down the earth and called off because of their remarks patrassky a former white has assistant press secretary under Ronald Reagan said recent comments by the actors ultimately could put our troops in even more danger reach Wednesday night robin said he was dismayed by the decision he responded with letter he planned to send a patrassky telling him you belong with the cowards and ideologues in the hall of infamy and shame the weekend a fair plan months ago was also the feature bolder on actor Robert wool and Ron Shelton who wrote and directed the 1988 film instead of commemorating the movie to halt canceled a celebration letter to this into the scheduled participants in a free country such as hours every american has got the right to his or her own opinions and to express them public figure such as you have platforms much larger than the average americans which provides you an extraordinary opportunity that have your views heard and an equally large obligation to act in speak responsibly patrassky wrote another way to agree with his opinion we believe you're very public criticism a president for ship is important in sensitive time in our nation's history helps undermine the u.s position which ultimately could put our troops in even more danger which of course it did not and the kick-ass entry weeks okay even though there's still a lot of crap going on robins and serandon his longtime partner of an active in peace rallies to protest this war in Iraq and his letter robin said he remained skeptical of the war and told patrassky he didn't realize baseball was able to public in sport when you better get with it him because we have all the sports arc republican sports except for basketball course which has a lot of schvarts is huh don't you think the NBA would probably be more democrat and and also maybe some of the NFL with all that money that that kind of change like i said it's a republican sport you're right good point about time five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen tf you're really rushing into the because we got so much stuff through so much to do it so little time you know what

twenty two don't remember remisfile the sixteen Steve mystery go cane six and gold bird six George Rodriguez and I retired with four and wrestling about just one honor here and everybody votes yet but he will he will Billy he will WQAM yes sir hey I love your show you eat new app but I just eat but I disagree with you on the war man which is all you know I'm saying yeah I listen at least we're not gonna come down here and take a dump on a front to lawn here because it was horrible I won't do that but tell me I did that on the way out today's matter fact I hope you have a smell it all way up here that tell me at least you feel good for the for the Iraqi people at least I at least are free now which I know said at the other day when it took the statute on I said it was a very innovating and emotional scene and it was great enough but the problem is keep in mind that that was only a very small group of people and a lot of them are still very suspect of what's to follow this is all you know fine and dandy as far as it goes but let's see how we followed in fact one of our stories today a quote's a homie car side the president of Afghanistan who's having a fit because he says this looks like they have a wall over again and it's just the same kind of images that that we saw and then they didn't follow through and they've done nothing and in a whole country all the all the lunatics are back in power again all the warlords and the right back to where they were before in Afghanistan so we talk of good game in the beginning and then we don't follow through don't like Miguel you know talks about those promotions and never follows through they would take it try not to look at this is a left right thing either I mean I hate how people just fall into the middle of the world and he's for the war he's on the left sir and he's not on the left he's a he's an opportunist is what he is he's a sellout I know him very well and believe me sold out well I mean don't look at his left right thing I mean you don't have to agree with him I'm looking at his allowed looking at realistic that I'm looking at it for what it is and I'm looking at the people who put it over on a public and I'm seeing again you're trying to change that what did you call for because you're not going to change my mind I won't change it I'm not changing your mind on anything I'm just saying you don't look at that well you know you agree with me I just get concerned I don't have to fall into line I don't look at him moving along I don't understand how to look at him what are you call for you start to say something about about something else no that was it okay thanks no he did he was saying something he left into this or right about and don't do this don't don't tell me or anybody else what to do if you want to look at it is the left against the right the good guys against the event fact isn't that what it's supposed to be the good the good guys against the evil doors us against them anybody who doesn't is on our side is up with them that's what your president has done so he's the one created that not me and haven't I said the Democrats are just as much to blame as anybody else because they're much of whims having I said that a million times yes I have absolutely correct useless party man useless they're kind of like the Iraqi army and the just as dangerous they have

hurt him god almighty what like I said the other day what is it that we're fighting for if not for the freedoms that we used to have and I underline used to have if we're not fighting for that then

all bits so they just calm down and we live ball and quit trying to pretend to be somebody else what the other McGill just bring me here oh thank you like I said investigators say on three occasions well no I gotta go back to the beginning a date police officer allegedly prefer patrolling the VIP lines of a strip joint to the streets of date county was arrested yesterday on charges he falsified his time sheets to cover his naughty encounters how do you like that exposed sergeant Felix Martinez a 19 year veteran of the north-day patrol squad investigators say on three occasions January 28th February 4th and 9th Martinez received new dances in a private VIP room at the master's gentleman's cabaret rye 53 25 north-west 77th Avenue and unincorporated day county while on duty and in uniform while waiting in his uniform soil the dance was a stripper turned confidential informant who needed him to fix her drivers license ever port states Martinez cannot be reached for combat yesterday according to an affidavit file by the day state attorneys orifice here's what happened the dirty dancing took place in the club's VIP room which ran south for about $200 up pop but the service was provided in martinis free of charge uh-huh martinis 41 on the dancer age unknown worked out the details of the agreement about midnight January 24 he was on duty and in uniform as was she martinis city would take care of two open arrest traffic warsters changed for a personal show she said shown off later that morning between 426 and 439 am martinis one of the date policeman's criminal justice information system obtained the dancers driving records or the drivers dancing records he later prepared a motion for relief of regard regarding the two restaurants and filed up with a clerk and courts having division how do you like that four days later she dance for him is promised a week later cheated so again the next day for bortiff martinis visited the Richard gurs thing the dick bursting criminal justice building and paid the fees for the dancer to attend traffic school that same day he reminded her she ought to make future dancing performance in martyre april all brother this is beautiful by you see times the toughest of these guys since they closed down those four houses in the day of the capture run couple years ago with those underrated for those 16 and 17 year old girls unsurie when martinis became the prime suspect is being the leak in an ongoing investigation police put a mobile tracking device on his car that's when police discovered martinis lies about his daily activities and falsified time sheets investigated say between fribory five and march twenty of martinis was paid thirty three dollars and twenty two cents an hour almost as much as beiner boy cheated taskers out of fifty four hours and fifty three minutes of his services or eighteen hundred thirty five dollars and thirty two cents of alleged duping he engaged in a systematic continuous pattern of falsifying official documents with a corrupt intent to gain a benefit for himself according to the FNAV and a benefit court court or himself as the motion he prepared in the dancers name investigators team martinis falsified information forged the confidential sources signature and subsequently and structured a lot of the court regarding her previous failures to appear so that her testimony would be consistent with the falsified information in the motion for relief which is what he wanted relief score court police team martinis may have leaked confidential information regarding active investigations including what it masters gentleman's cabaret he's been charged with one kind of unauthorial compensation nine counts of official misconduct and one kind of grand theft and he said it was grand how do you like that huh man old man he's in some of the same people I'm sure who are busy point of the finger just like up there and brown the good old BS all in by the way sped on

He's losing control again. I guess he wants to attention He's jealous now so I'm got all the attention now Fiddell would like so I say hey, and I will go for that Just over a weekend we could take care of that bearded piece of turd But in his town what are they worried about not Fiddell not so wrong not the George W. Not the future of the universe, but South Florida leaders carefully negotiated for months to bring the Latin Grammys award show to Miami this year, but but City commissioner still hope the organization doesn't invite entertainers from Cuba to the yellow event. Oh my god Led by commissioner Tomas regalato commissioner's voted for the zip yesterday to words Grammy organizers to refuse to recognize or invite any Cuban artists because of the country's recent crackdown on the distance if wouldn't have been for that For some other reason have it in do with Fiddell Mayor Mani Diaz who for months aggressively angled to bring the show to South Florida walkday diplomatic Tyrop over the subject He said he agreed with the resolution but gave his assurance that he would not pull his welcome of Latin Grammys if organizers do not comply So in other words he's gonna have it both ways he agrees with him but he agrees with you know He's all over the place he's right down on the tight rope while the sun is pretty enough some more money A dispute over the location of exile demonstrations plan to protest the possible parents of Cuban artists and a drove the show away for mining 2001 this year civic leaders lured back to show in part by convincing organizers that the political climate had changed. Oh, yeah the political climate in South Florida has changed Regalato said the city needs to punish the Cuban government for its human rights violations in Latin Grammy officials should deliver message That they too will not tolerate that type of behavior. I didn't know that the recording artist and were the ones who were calling shots in the government there You know that had no idea No, I know Fidel saying this is some this year. That doesn't punish anybody but us down here. This is not crazy This is fair regalato said Asked if he would support protests against the ceremony said I wouldn't just support it. I'd be protesting he'd be in it You're an asshole to moss If the Latin Grammys do invite Cuban artists regalato said he'll propose that the city not provide any funding for the show Here we go again for the show The Cuban government is recently too while we know that Grammy officials decline to come in and the resolution because they said they had But it's said we will not sway the position about inviting Cuban artists to the show land recording Academy spokesman Ron Roker said nominees will not be known to later this year but said all artists who are nominated will be extended an invitation. We'll go for you Ron Regalato sudden proposal at Thursday's Commission meeting caught commissioner's by surprise because the matter wasn't even on the agenda on the agenda When commissioner Angel Gonzalez seconded the resolution of our discussion commissioner R. T. El Junior shot back. There's nothing to discuss Other than commissioner Johnny Whitten who was absent for part of the meeting all the commissioner supported the resolution of course because they're all fearful But some said they did not respect for Regalato's constituents not because their personal stance on the issue They're just glue step in the lawn. They don't have the balls to say it is as crazy if you're hurting a community again You're gonna take away a lot of money. We're gonna get embarrassed once again and look like some of the matter We publicly we really are from coast to coast pillar to post Bell Yankee out put it back in LA and we'll be sitting here holding our shlong in our hands That's what it's gonna be Because this this obnoxious little group of people of little dictator minded assholes.

A small child with a drip feed that's no as lay on a blanket I had to wait for four days for an operation Its eyes looked dead I didn't have the heart to ask its mother if this was a boy or a girl There was an air strike perhaps a half mile away in the hospital corridor is echoed with the blast long and low and powerful And it was followed by a rising course of mones and cries from the children outside the words Below them in that worst of all emergency rooms they brought in three men who had been burned across their faces and arms and chest and legs Naked men with a skin of blood and tissues when the doctors paced with white cream who sat on their beds with their skillless arms held upwards Each bee's teaching an unexistent savior to rescue him from his pain No, no, no another young man screamed as doctors tried to cut open his pants He shrieked and cried and we need like a horse. I thought he was a soldier He looked up and strong and well fed but now he was a child again and cried Uma Uma which means mommy mommy I left this awful hospital to find the American shells falling in the river outside I noticed two simulatory tents on a small patch of grass near the hospitals administration building and God dammit I set under my breath and armored vehicle with a gun mounted on it hidden under the branches and foliage It was only a few meters inside the hospital grounds, but the hospital is being used to conceal it And I couldn't help noticing the name of the hospital Audnam Karwala had been president Sodom's minister of defense A man who allegedly fell out of his leader and died in the helicopter crash whose cause was never explained Even in the last hours of the battle of Baghdad, its victims had a line of building named it on a remote-edited man Lovely story, it doesn't quite job at Osloi as pictures you've seen last couple of days And you'll never see pictures of various little tiny snippets of that on your TV news on all day you're talking head never swancin well But not too much because it's not good for business Not good for the images that we're trying to portray here in the pep rally known as the What were conned? What was the operation Iraqi freedom excuse me I came from remember it's sick really sick Walley and dear field one of our most chronic but most intelligent facts who says you'll quote's HL-manking You'll never go broke under arresting the intelligence American people is never a concept more ever to know all of your rights Just put it on TV pedal it morning noon and night and they'll buy into it and anybody who disagrees as a scumbag Anyway Getting back to the appool Bill O'Reilly somebody says pop a sands fox his own pillar rally amen got him on here kind of we got him Here's what it says how about that evil self-studded domestic diva Martha Stewart and whatever happened with Martha Stewart She was gonna go to jail.

I want to give me instructions how to do the show. Okay, we'll put it down. Well, I mean to have a big ego. What does that have to do? Didn't even understand the question. He doesn't even get it. Maybe I'm an asshole. Okay, that would be fine to be called worse. What does that have to do with a big ego? Look it up in the dictionary. Sir, okay. EG. That's how you spell it. EG. Moe Howard David at 90. Rush Limbaugh 77. George W. 46. Rumsfield 343. I got 31. I'll take it. Howard sperm 28. Hank Goldberg 19. Mr. Ego Steve can still have 13. This is audience. That's it. Plus the people over the age of 100 that do listen to them. They have no computer. Like this last guy. You know, low-right guys like you said that have no computer. We're going to have time for you. So, bye, bye, bye. But a QI in. WQI in. Yes, sir. Great, huh? Yes, it is. See, I think I'll come through again. It's my ego. I know. I don't know if you saw the front one. Keith Lasslan and PBS. No, he did not. I was watching. It was about how to deal with Korean and how do we get this way with them? It was just in the head of the diplomat or the ambassador of South Korea. He said when he reported that, how did the whistopalty towards North Korea? He said there is an apology. He doesn't attitude. Right. And he got a Richard Perl, one minor, number one. And he said, well, that's not true. And that's not the way he did. And you know, we're not going to give them what they want. And the sanctions have been work and all this stuff. And it was just interesting piece. And you know, but they don't want to wrap it up. I'm a knowing man, armhand and lots of weapons there. So if you don't want to talk, I mean, they're which is kind of strange. So they're a lot more dangerous than the Sodom was. Of course. Yeah. And that, and Richard Perl, which should be on your list. So I'm never seen anybody with a bigger ego than him who has a. Yeah, you're right. He belongs on a recent, American, the snoring piece of crap. You're right. Many of the controls, obviously, he's not in the government. But he has tied to everybody there. And he pushes war as much as change in the room felt. And like he's a, certainly one of the key ringlutus to that. You may be his on. Thanks a lot. Richard Perl, P.E.R. L.A. I know you're in a hospital. So here's the story. We got a facts from Jack. Thank you, Jack. Love the show. He says he does one got a happy. Main suspect. We had this on a website. But from Fox News, though, that's oh my God. So we'll have to check it out. Main suspect, and you guys says cold bombing escaped from him. He prison. You saw this story. What you must do because I had to put it on there. Yeah, that's right. Escape from Yamaha. Yemeni authorities were hunting for 10 of the main suspects in the 2000 bombing. The US has cool after they escaped from prison that a official said. The fugitive is including chief suspect. Jamal, Aldvadao, we had been jailed in the port city of Aiden. Since shortly after the destroyer was bomb killing 17 American sailors. The officials at Aiden's governor's office would not say how to men escape early the day. But they quoted intelligence sources as saying security forces were out in force and a major search operation. Photos of the men were distributed into police and houses of these gate men's relatives were searched. The official said on condition of anonymity. Officials said the men might have left Aiden headed to Al-Qaeda strongholds in the northern province of Shabwa. What was an accurate, okay? So that's a while more about his Al-Qaeda because there's still out there. They're still there. And Hezbollah and Hamas and all these other terrorist groups. That's why I thought we were at war with. That's what we were told. I guess there was a change of plan in nobody sent us the memo. They didn't email us. Let's see. It says Rick Sanchez has been on MSC and we've seen for weeks. Now hopefully it fixed his ass. Yeah, once in a while on CNBC they've been a gambling channel. They'd stick over there for like 30 seconds for a news update. So they relegated him to the minor leagues because they are obviously the weatherware. He is not ready for prime time. The first time they saw him squat on the map of the Middle East. They just I wrecked now. This ain't channel 7 in Miami, okay Rick? This is worldwide MSNBC, okay? Even though nobody's watching. Don't be doing that. They couldn't stop it. They give squatting every now and then. As an accident, you know? And when you eat all the burritos. Woo, Rick. Anyways, as I voted for him, but it was difficult with Mohour on the pool. Thank you, Jack. Excellent choice. 91 votes for the molemeister. The biggest ego going man. The molemeister. They love him. Almost as much as he's got. Almost as much as I do. Rush Limbaugh. Big fat.

Oh yeah, well I am. This is a great thanks to Telemundo. This is a petition to Telemundo to give the Iraqi information minister. My Hammond Said Al-Sahaf is on TV show. To which we say, yeah, I like it. He's a hoot. Lot funnier than Jay Leno, I'll tell you that. Which in sin much. Think of the possibilities to cross over demographics with resultant Telemundo finally beating Spanish media giant univision. The Iraqi information minister, my Hammond Said Al-Sahaf and his own TV show, can lie about the Nielsen ratings. In his own words, Telemundo's anime, Univision and Dutchist are competitor, but they are louts, blood sucking vasters, wet dogs, work criminal studios, and a bunch of creeps. In addition to his Telemundo show, he would tackle tough local political issues like Mayor Alice Penelis' Nodacrook. How barbaric can just of our position would date County schools. Miriam Al-Sahaf and her husband, Lionel, were framed. How the Mami airport projects are way under budget. The Iraqi information minister, my Hammond Said Al-Sahaf and his show would add an international flier by hosting world leaders like Fidel Castro with Tom McStopics like communism, people who love it. And an era fat topic those Dan Jews are taking my shoes and Syria the next Middle East Utopia. The possibilities are endless not to mention the ratings. At this time, we would like to request you forward to email all your friends to our voices heard loud and clear. Give the Iraqi information minister, my Hammond Said Al-Sahaf is on TV show, plays and you are... That's so lovely correct. Thank you, Mani and Carl Gagelsus's is you love the show, but when there's another one for you, all you naysayers, that's too. The last two facts is they love the show. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Why can't wait till Joe's a gacking? Get on here, one o'clock. Let me ask you this.

BAN. BAN. BAN. But that awful awful love. New England, OXA. I always thought it was New York accent, but they tell me he's the England. I thought it was New York too. They got a, um... The England guy who signed... Bob Montgomery used to be a color on a red sock schemes on TV. And then I think he croaked and they brought in the jury. Remy who sounds just like him. But that same awful Boston song. And I think I got a guy doing a color. I got that awful boring, uh... ...vald Shawn Nameddonna. Doing a play by playing a college hockey tournament. And the color guys, one of those stereotypical, the England guys with that ...an awful awful, a heavy. I mean, I love Boston. No kidding me wrong. The people are wonderful and the food is great. But... Man, shout out, that's good. That, but the sound of that accent is... And this is on a national telecast too, you know. I can understand if it's a regional thing. And by the way, is there a worse hockey announcer in the world than daylarnled? Oh, my god. He makes Chris Morris out like Bill Hewitt. Get him out of there. Thale Arnold. Fred Cusik would be... I guarantee your Fred Cusik will turn over in his grave when he dies. Let's bring Fred Cusik back. Pretty good one's fun, couple games. Three. Sorry to my Bruinspan out there, but I'd warn you. They got two shots, none. Kind of like the least in the second period against Philadelphia, two shots. One went in by the way, and I just got a tie dummy.

And then I cue that just like what he found in Al Capone's vault empty. Pathetic. Got him on here. He's on. How about, uh, what is this? Oh, yeah. I don't think so. I don't think so. Scott, there's a song he wants to hear that we ain't going to be playing no more. Sorry, Scott, but you better get used to it. No, because we're not even going to say crap anymore in here. In fact, just one last time. Okay, here we go, boys and girls. That's it. Well, hear that no more. What are you laughing about? Because it's funny.

I'm happy Friday to you Paul Krugman's comments on our website today from the York Times conquest and neglect Just run away a little bit can I do that I can't he? He says one has to admit the bush people are very good at conquest military and politically Focus all the retention on an issue they pull out all the stops They don't worry about breaking the rules this technique brought them victory in the Florida Recon battle The passage of the 2001 tax cut the fall of Kabul victory in the midterm elections and the fall of Baghdad But after the triumph when it comes time to take care of what they've won the retention wanders and things go to pot The most obvious example is Afghanistan the land of bush administration for god Most of the country is back under the control of fundamentalist warlords Unpaid soldiers and policemen are deserving and droves remember that the bush administration forgot to include any Afghan aid in this last budget I'll re-forget that Huh Maybe we'll have to cut out some of those tax cuts for the rich. No. Okay.

What the bull? 1232 at 560W came got another great story for our website. Did I have a great story for our website today? I don't have to take them to be too long. But it's great. It's by Mark Morford and the SFK, whose paper is commenced. The lia liberation, shearing your mackeys, adjusted to version post bush companies real goal is only just beginning. Excellent article. Okay. I'll give it to you. I'll pass it along. It should be on our website. Don't forget to enjoy Marlins broadcast your book, Shambi, tomorrow afternoon noon to two at Rick K. Sacker. Located in a half miles south of Summar's on 441. Stop by the wind some prizes. Are usual low budget QM prizes. Registered when some Marlins tickets. Anybody want those? No. And enjoy free food. That's the PS2 Resistance. Plus, Boosie Good Guy. With orange here. Atlantic City Sub provides a free food. Where our end of bread makes a difference. And Scott is no longer involved. Oh, man. What a great month. This has been, you know what? 560505060. 560. We get PD Lenny out of here. Oh, yeah. We get ready to Scott. Woo. What do you think? Mo next? W2AM. Well, yes sir. Is the CEO of the largest house? Speaking. Oh, okay. I just want to do, I put for our radio station. And I'm a, uh, a morning in Christian. I'm so sorry. Oh, that's okay. And I believe with, uh, or my heart, that we should be over there fighting this walk. Yeah. Are there any questions? I don't know if you're killing a bunch of vushmothands for Jesus. That what it is. Pardon? You say you do believe we should be there. No, we don't. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah. And I thought our president was a good Christian though. Good board again Christian. Well, my no, but the whole thing is, as many people have to see. They think he's going over there to free the people. But it's not oil. He's freeing up the gas pumps. Yeah, exactly. And then taking care of, uh, to call out group. It's not the only thing that's involved with him. And he's been in hell of hurting all of his other big business friends, right? Exactly. You've got it, man. You've got it, man. Okay. I'll pray for you. I mean, I'll pray for us. Thank you. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. And what he's basically saying is, how can anybody who professes to be a Christian? I'll perpetrate such slaughter in the name of liberation. And liberation by elimination, by elimination, by decapitation, by palpitation. Well, that's a deal we're talking about there. Liberation by decapitation. Chop both his arms off. Wouldn't Jesus be over there flying the planes in mind? No, he would not. Boy. But don't confuse all these other people, though, because the righteous, no matter what you say, and this guy wasn't one of them, but some of the God's brothers always find some quote from the Lord somewhere to justify the barbaric grotesque things that they do. Jesus Christ. Yeah, he wouldn't be too happy about it. To justify their hatred, their condemnation, whatever it is, because like I've always told you, religion is the root of all evil. There are two things that they go hand in hand, baby. Religion and money. Hand in hand. And of course religion is all about money, because it's the biggest business on the face of the earth. WQAM. At least the biggest tax fee won anyway. Yes sir. Hello, Neil. Aha. Yeah, Neil. You may want to consider your position on the war. Well, I don't think so. When the Pope and the Boring and Christians are on your side. Yeah, I don't think so. Well, you know, no, I don't think so. Maybe one of my considerers, okay? See, if you want to make a comment and discuss something, that's fine. But if you want to tell me what to do, then at that point I say bye-bye. Bye. Then that's not a conversation. And that guy might be the only Boring and Christian against the Lord. On other, there's plenty of board again, Christians against the Lord. Just like there were a lot of conservative Republicans against the Lord. A Papu cannon with vehemently opposed to it. In the beginning, and then of course, there were a lot of others who later I'm lost their balls, because it wasn't fashionable to do it. I may want to change my position based on see, I don't make my positions based on, Well, who agrees with me on this? See, I make it based on common sense. Based on what I read, what I see, what I know, not based on, well, who agrees with this agrees? How many of you weigh in? Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Listen, by the way, you warned everybody two years ago, by the way, when this administration took off, so, okay. Don't say it by the way again, because George will get upset. Okay. He's not your wife. Yeah, you said they had their own agenda. And there you go. And we're finding that out now, aren't we? That is correct. Listen, I'm just trying to find out where we're. Can we go on your site to get them? I'm just interested in the Michael Mourning you read. Yes, you're there. The piece, can you find all this stuff on your own? Yes. Yes. We're going to take a particular place. We go when we get out there. Click on the features part. The features part? Yeah, it'll take a couple of seconds to open depending on how fast your connection is, because there's a lot of stuff on there, but click on it and let it go and it'll open up. Okay, including the algorithm thing to do. Absolutely. See our new story is done there. And then the features page will connect you with all the stress from the path, which is a Ziggy, and I'm so you have to scroll through where you'll find it. I mean, I think copies of all this stuff. I'm going to just paste it on my postports. I mean, I got a lot of people I need to go show this to all they want to. Action out. So anyways, probably the word be an evangelist. All right. Good job Neil. Thanks, Paul. So here you go. Check out the arrages.com, any iLROGERS.com. You want a little bit of the truth. Oh, you should reconsider. I mean, those people just send me, man, right to the bull. You should recon. And in fact, I wonder if maybe that's why he's in favor of the word, just because the Pope's against it. That's pretty brilliant. Huh? Well, what is that? What kind of a logic is that? Exactly. It's not logic. And the port again, Christians, at least the ones the good ones who aren't judge Menel or art point in the figure in hating everybody. And the condemning everybody who does degree with their religion to hell. Well, more power to them is what I say. Of course, we don't find too many of them because the media don't find them too exciting. Right. Solid majority. So every time there's any kind of controversy going on, it's Jerry Falwell. It's Pat Robertson. It's a Daniel Graham. Franklin Graham and Billy Graham. It's the same bunch. Same crowd over and over and over and over. Because that's the media's neurotic repetition. They know that if they bring certain well-known personalities on the ear, it'll go stuff their numbers. Didn't work for Phil Lannoy to well, but nevertheless. That's what it's all about. It's got nothing to do with the reality. Nothing to do with really a parameter of what people are thinking. It has to do with here's a bunch of assholes who you know are assholes and either agree with them or you hate them. And we know that you'll tune in and get all bent out of shape, which is not the case with me. I see that fat-faced, farce, Paul Wall on there. And I'm going to another channel immediately. Why would you dignify him with their time when you know exactly what he's going to say? What would be the point? Instigation? No, the point is to try to get you because they know that he gets people crazy and they're going to get people to tune in. That's that's a reason. Instigating people to tune in and then goose up their numbers. Because don't forget that we're all horrors in the media. And the only one honest enough to tell you that it's a horror business. So that's why the war business was part of the horror business. That's right. This is a frantic. Oh, we got it first. You know, that's one thing I'll say for CNN. I can't say too much for these certainly not news network. Is that when they had the, they dropped the 4 gigantic 2,000 pond bombs on the complexity of the night. They weren't so quick to judge, you know. They weren't jumping right. Well, I must have been see said, you know. Fox of course was hyperventilating. I didn't see it, but several people told me about it. Hyperventilating. There was no doubt that he and the sons were in there. They're dead. You had a yaddi, a hallelujah, glory, and all this other crap. So I'll say that for them. Although Aaron Brown definitely needs a new piece. My life and law, this is for Trial by 60. You way too, yeah. New yaddi. Are you a fairy and he's all. We want to get some plan. We've been having a plan for this. Oh, I see. I didn't say that. That's what the party reminded me of the previous statements about things in the particle. Why? Self hitting home most stories. Gag and Mary. Home home has to go for it. It's usually made her second flush clear. Please, a queer, a warm off. Means a poop and a condosing queen. That is shoes. The home confuses. They're painting shoes. Who wears衣? On the knees is shoes. The opportunity to defend an off with the leader of that country. You can't. We are confetti, so he's got to get married. Very fair. Very fair. And he's gone again married. They're painting home most stories. Gag and Mary. It's both fair. Of the white house, home most. Yeah. It's a fair. It's a fair. And a dark, radish moth with a bow of stone. A clowned shrug. That's what he stole for. That's me, Drunk-Hole. And he never reached to down a road. Very tough. Sweep me lifting very slow. He's got to get married. Very fair. And he's gone again married. They're painting home most stories. Gag and Mary. Home most has to come for me. Home most has to come for me. Home most has to come for me. I'm sure I'm also going to write up with the right one. And then, of course, we'll go back in the closet. Four tears at the other way around. Fourteen to one. S David Brock at five, sixty WQM. Ask Miss So what's your name? Miss Grudge. So our worship hole listener Jane in four-lautardale says. The story about the little kid may be cry. My jackass boss Kim and give me a funny look. He voted for the bastard. I wonder if he'll ever regret it. I'm expecting to be laid off any day now. Business is so slow. He's going in the dead to keep the place going. Please check out the book The Best Democracy Money can Buy. By Greg Palaest. It's where Michael Morgan has information about the election scam. Love you too, Jane. Thank you. And you're looking for a bill. I saw him. I saw him out of the corner of my eye. Which is hard to miss. Now, when you got such a smitty look on your face for him. Come on. Let's go. See? He looks a scared. And you want to know why? Because he's his biggest sub-acraft. How you look like you may have lost an answer to? I guarantee you, from noon until now he was in the T-Roman there. Just, I'm happy that Pukin has got out. Okay, purging. The big purge. Okay, wait a minute. Let me give you an appropriate lead in here. Here we go. Beep is stepping on the scale. The scale is broken. The scale is broken. The scale is broken. The scale is broken. The scale is broken. The scale is broken. The scale is broken. You know, let's see. It's 4-11. I must be putting a wrong date, so yeah. 4-11. It's his height and the date. And the weight and the weight. And the weight. In fact, you started, I think that was his weight, 4-11. 2-24. It lost a half a pound in the last week. You know something you could fart. Why, no, you're going to speak in that thing. Go ahead and tell the world why you're such a failure. I have no excuses. Huh? I have no excuses. No wonder more hate you like poison. And he does. At least I have a bad boss in accent though. Yeah. Is he from Boston? No, but you were complaining before. Because Dale Arnold and Jerry Rammy and all those people. Who's the guy that does the color run was college hockey game? I've no idea. Sounds just like Jerry Rammy. Oh, he's just off it. That same sound. You know, you know the sound. So wicked piste. That sound. Oh, he's just awful. High boy won't stop calling. He's still turning around when he's around. What's he going to do? Take your food. You know something's bad boy. If you ever called during this show again, we're going to tell all the stories from Treasure Island on the hero. Okay. As a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, that inspires me to play my favorite fat boy song. Yeah. You cover crap, okay. There was anything alive that would touch the best party. If they could find it. Just what he needs. Free food. He said honey got money for you. Oh, when you take him away, he's just a private food. Hey, John. Hey, John. Hey, John. That man's six minutes, John. Oh, John. Hey, John. Hey, John. Don't you insist. I'm gonna hold it down like a tuna fish. Take it up a big roll, Rob. He's fat. You know, he's fat. He's only fat and smell. Which he tailed where his fat. Hey, John. Hey, John. Hey, John. Hey, John. That's the good thing, John. Girls just have to handle it and think fat guys. She know how to make the ball get dry. That man's six minutes, John. Oh, boy, he's just a private food. Hey, John. Hey, John. That's the good thing, John. So let me ask you this. What was the excuse? What was the rationale? Because I don't want to wish the time with him because what's the point? What's his excuse? This week. Because he had to go eat with his new lady love. So he couldn't. He had to go eat his new lady love. And we're supposed to believe that. Pretty sad, man. There's the face of failure. As matter of fact, remember the movie Fatso did you see it? Parts of it. And once he found his true love, he wasn't eating all the time because he had something to occupy his time. That was the reason he lost the weight. Not was eaten like a cow. Mr. Tub. Mr. Beast. He's literally disappointing. You realize now he has lost an even 60 pounds. I'll say that. But he started. I don't even have the other sheets. We already spent 10 a million like a year ago. You know, I mean, that's not all that bad. But we got to get it in gear man. He's getting lazy. He's getting laid. Yeah. Lightly story. WBQAM. Children in course. I didn't like that. Like about a half or I'm so quick today, man. You ain't got a half a chance sweetheart. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. You tell that's fat boy. If you ever darkens our door during the show again, I'm going to report him to the SPCA. Okay. What a top of crap. And see, that's what I like exactly what those PTS did. They didn't bring those for him. They brought him for the morning guys from Mo and the guilty. I mean, the fact he works on his show. He could have had seven or eight of them. And he did. He did doing the show in any walk study. He would have sacked and claims he's bringing him to the blind organization. Oh, please. Yeah. Talk about the fat leading the blind. Who are you kidding, Mr. The fat people in denial. At least I admit it. I'm working on it. I'm trying very hard. Those people just didn't denial. Just, and now I understand more than ever before, why there are a lot of people out there with no sympathy for fat tubs of crap. Okay. At least, who will you all ask 25 pounds? I am burst of into it. He gives me credit. And now he's working on it. Doing a nice job. I'm not going to waste my time anymore with the losers like the beast and fat boy. Josh Friedman. Oh my god. Oh, geez. And then there are many more, but time doesn't permit. 5. Local. This is 5. 6. 3. 0. Q. M. How? Aaron's coming. What little Eastern world? Will be exploded to dumb at people killed with the gas that we sold him. First time a gresser nation and the only one that's going. Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing. Forget a mass career. The nooks there told you that the right wing is really getting over and over and you are hit. That Iraq has some champions of past destruction. 3,000 people killed. Arnoldburgot. Let's exploit him instead. Eight. There's oil to be content. Going after said time to. Plank hate Osama. There's no longer mention of the name in lawless. But no one seems concerned. I'm being complacent. Believe in every word of this cartel is minestration. Back and throw this by fear. For me, the amernepulation and the right wing is thrilling and over and over and to our heads. And Iraq has some weapons of past destruction. The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying. We're all suspects now. Not the ash property. I have nothing to hide. Table of partners all are saying. I know beating in cattle don't have any reserve agent. Out of provoke, cattle and swirl the annihilation. Old regime must fall and have a virgin and stoke with no objection at all. Tim a friend don't have the balls and the right wing is thrilling and over and over and to our parade washbeds. Iraq has some weapons of past destruction. Oh my god. So leader boy has put the picture up. Now what was that in? Was that in the star like I thought? It was all over the place. The picture, the 12 year old boy. Ali, who lost both of his arms. And it's on our website. I caution you again. We got a lot of graphic pictures on there. Very disturbing and nauseating and sickening. But you know, if you want to be 30 yourself since you were watching all those glamorous pictures of people marching and jumping up and down away when it flags together, you really ought to take a look at this too. War is sick. War is grotesque. It is butchery. War must only be fought for the right reasons. This as so many people have said was the wrong war at the wrong time for the wrong reason. Great job this week by the way. Be in a boy. Thank you. As a matter of fact, we're thinking about the judge may be coming back and lamblesy. Let's see how it goes. I'm going to think about it over the weekend. Joe, it's a gag. He's coming up next to the mad dog. Have a great weekend. Oh my. Oh my. Bye bye. I'm a jerk. I'm five six. I'm a jerk. I'm a jerk. I can't stop. I can't stop.
