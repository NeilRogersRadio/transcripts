It's about time he's in Miami. He's doing all week his vacations over the parties over Neil. So anyway the, no it's not. No it's not. The first of which is my feeling ever to love his mixed doubles partner is in hospital right now he's suffering from a parasite. The city has tapeworm in his system. Yeah. And that's our luck. Welcome to this overhead is so goddamn loud. What is this crap in here? I'm going back to a good studio. I play heavy metal music. I'm not talking about your crap. I'm talking about my in here these speakers. Is there enough people in that room for you? This thing is a piece of turg man. You can smell it. They thought it was going to piece that I smelled in the parking lot. Oh yeah that was better now. Here's the last story. That was good this morning. I pull up in a parking lot and there's Moan Kelly. The welcoming the reception committee. Yeah they were just. I thought that was the biggest made. My day is made. No, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it was still picking Dingo Buries out of his house. I think he, he flicked a couple of my vets. So whoever's Corvette down there, they're beautiful, convertible. Fenty thought that was mighty flick Dingo Buries on your convertible top. Yeah that's some other guy from sales. Is it? I don't know who's it is. We can't figure out who's it is. I can't believe we got somebody who would good enough taste the owner of that although don't get a convertible because the tops right out down here in case you haven't noticed. You know what I had? I told you that you haven't been to the goalie. You remember the goalie, Norman Maracley was awful. He had a miracle. Yeah, and you're real. Yeah, but he made a save it was a miracle. Yeah, he had a Corvette with a letter top. And we got back from a road trip one day and somebody had sliced up in the roof. How about that Kojo? How's getting hey, what he deserves? How did he get injured? There's sliced in him and asked with a ball-peen hammer. There is nothing quite like going to a hockey game in Toronto every night. It's an event. There's nothing like being in Toronto every day is an event. But here. There's no events. In fact, being all the years have taken their tool on screw-in. The whole sales department was lined up to give me that phony, meat, and greeting, and eating in the craftmen of the go. What the hell happened to that bitch? I don't know. Seriously, have you seen her lately? Yeah, she's just tired. She has aged about 100 years. Oh my god, if you sit at her, she may break down and go into a rubber room. No, seriously. No, this is in my right George. I think the best thing you had here, I was here in June and since June, you're on many years she's aged. But third man, she's in the, I think you're looking like a Portuguese washer woman. She looks so. You're a beautiful statue of the like a scrum. I'm a building. Listen, statues. I will pay for it. I'll pay a thousand dollars. I'm a jokein. I will pay a thousand dollars if they're willing. This company's one of the bill for a stack. If I'm out for the bill to build a statue out in front of the building for you. I love that. I'm serious. I want to be in a court as you know that the five sharing men and I heard you suck it up to modus. Why don't you have any stuff respected all? He's not going to do anything for you besides stabbing a back. I eat free. Okay. Now that we got numbers, now that we got numbers, Howard, and he's going right along sucking your ass. Who then you guys can? He's got great numbers. Yeah, he's got a one and you got a nine. Yeah. No, seriously. You do realize that I totally the sun Thursday. There's 10 points in there. Okay. Yeah. There's 10 points. You're number one. Because you'll listen to me. It's a five. Well, if I would have been here the whole time we'd had a 12-year, but George did okay. Good. So you know that is because they had a seven point eight year in the afternoon and June. July, whatever hell it was. The hammer's just huge. He was never on. Oh, you know who the secret weapon is, don't you? Yeah, there he goes. He's got a two years. He's the guy in a play. He's a constant superstar who came with an ace of neither a plane crash. Anyway. So there's 10 points in there. You divided by two, the six to eight and the eight to ten, and you get the five year. So you got a two and he's I got to do this now. What is this scientific method? It's between six and ten. A M there's a five in men in July, which is what you guys have. In order to figure out, you're you're you deal with two to our segments. So you double the five to a ten to then you divide. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, average the average of the exactly very good. It's about time you did something good. So you're saying. So in other words, you have a nine and he's got a one. That is sweet. I just what I'm thinking. You know, I'm just making it up. I'm just wishing and praying and hoping so that October 15 when a summer book comes out and you got like about a seven. Yeah, in six to ten. That means it's 14 points. I mean, you got a 12 and he's got a two. He's got a 12. We'll have an 18 and the afternoon will have like a 15. The highest ever got in my career was in Philly on why I'd be at an 11 share at that 10 to 11. 11 five on WNWN WS. Many years ago at night. What's the idea? What's your career? Because you've been number one like a hundred and eight was a hundred and the one WS news. I had a listen to this on WINZ 10 to two back when I started doing this kind of talk. Yeah. I had a nine share in 12 plus 12 plus way to nine share and all the other demos were like 14s and 16s and 18s. Yeah. That's unbelievable. But that was on a real and I scored people during the cheap channel. Yeah. That's a station. We had a nine share in 12 plus. Now they've done an infraction. I got a lot of nothing. I offered in the world to do this show up against hammer three to seven. Yeah. The ball's the higher. I mean, what do you think he thinks of me now? Screw him. You're like the guy that I've been from him. What are you? How many problems? Come down. Can you don't know him? That's right. Oh, you're so full or crap. You don't have any problems with anybody. I'm glad I don't know him. I don't want problems. You're coming to me. You want this one dead. You want your Corvette. And I want everyone else. That line is you suck everybody's ass. I want him. That lets you. I can you have anyone who's like a new person. I want to tell you what you got to play together. I can make my own team. Or a good guy. Okay. I hope you write this here. I haven't forgotten since the thing. I've been talking and keep talking and keep talking and keep talking matter. I could talk and too. In fact, if you listen to your left speaker, you'll hear me in the right. Speaking, you're all here for a while. That's what it works. Second, bleeding ulcer. Oh, and I made a premature evaluation. Speaking of the vacation party's over. After Labor Day is when we stopped playing the bits are between one and two. Today we are still doing that. I did that. It's great. It's good. How many calls did you have in your two hours today? About three? I had about 30 minutes. Get out of here. I didn't know walked in the other room. There wasn't a single column of people. I had the first call I heard this morning coming to work with Moe was one. One and they're desperate to try to get his ass off the air. The whole call was spent trying all your terrible one. Good. Go away. You know, because you won't hang up on them because he's a pretty long time. I took about 75 calls today for people that want me dead in New York. Yeah. That's about it. I'm never worried about that. So I don't need colors to get off. So do you know where outscrew Anne or what is that what it is? I think she's looking at me. You must have done her up against the wall and that sales or office for hours. She looks like she's just the green. I think she wants you to look like a wreck. I think she knows I got a damn scrub woman. She looks like she ought to be scrubbing the floor in the turlet here. She wants to do me. Oh my god. I can't believe where you're shooting. If you do anybody including her friend. Oh god. And now she's got some sick living with her. Do you know right foster? I never used to play for that often. I think he's done gay. Do you remember to write foster? What? Yeah. No, I don't. You don't? I don't know what that is. Oh my god. He's got a big strong. That's why he worked here. I guess you didn't take any notes of that meeting last week. Mr. At that sexual hole. I didn't. And the beast. A midget bridge it. Stripping a touchy's hand. I want to tell you something for Gregory to be conducting a meeting on sexual harassment and a workplace would be like eight off Hitler conducting a meeting about anti semitism. You know what are we talking about? Welcome back to my evening. You'll have a nice day. You two Scott stay away from my back. Listening. Well congratulations. Get a life. There's only a little bit of a priest when I was living. He said he would take my soul. But we made a detour on the way to heaven. Then into his bedroom we did take a stroll. While he was standing in his underwear, told me to bend over and say a prayer. Both up his road and when they thank you to him, I got my list of better preacher may have been a little wrecked to read. The next day, I feel like a sinner. And I showed up to get communion. But on my tongue that was in a wait for him and it was a while of dripping on my chin. Work work. He was standing in his underwear, told me to bend over and say a prayer. Both up his road and when they thank you man. I got my list of better preacher may have been a little wrecked to read. Welcome. He was standing in his underwear, told me to bend over and say a prayer. Both up his road and when they thank you man. I got my list of better preacher may have been a little wrecked to read. 10 past 10 is break time at 5.60. That's a good scam. We got going across over with Scott, you know. That's a good deal.

Okay, I just get like a part of Arnold and stuff like that, but I don't know do you know it's stance on marijuana? No Yeah, he wants to decriminalize a big time in one of the guys But sir, sir. I wanted to criminalize it, but that doesn't make me eligible to be governor or Florida, okay? Just because he might say some things that you agree with does that mean that he's qualified to be dog catcher I did this insult to the limited intelligence of the American public sir Arnold for governor. It's it's pathetic Well at least that gives George a reason to at least to rich form since he's nothing to do with George move into California right now. He said he's either more to California or Canada one of the other But one of his one of his advice is either on curio Calvary Canada or Ontario California. What is it? One of his advisors don't ace like $2 million a year The normal yeah One of his advisors is abnormal too, and I hear one of his advisors is George Schulz who's a card carrying Nazi So have a nice day, okay, Phil from whatever that roofing place was.

Happy Monday. We got the Mad Dog in town in the studio To the studio. To the for the afternoon. We're nice to see him. Kim, a bulk camper. It's you. I tell you the humper has got a better scan than I've ever been And then he's never on No that was funny He's on the STV tower up program. He's on permanent vacation He's on Vegas. He will be doing a couple of shows. A couple of shows this week. I think Wednesday and Friday from Vegas Sam Dunn's Vegas. I'm all through with Vegas. I've had it. Okay. Fini Tho. Not Amsterdam. I changed my mind. Amsterdam. I got a little saw around there for a while as you know. But at least Amsterdam is always the possibility Like a good time. The probability. Not every day. Not like he used to be. It's not as wild and not as busy as he used to be. But it's okay. But Vegas. It's just guaranteed. You're going to lose a lot of money. Number one. Number two. It's a thing. It's like Disney World. You can go there. You know, a certain number of times. And after I'd say a few visits. But third man. That's it. There's no need to ever go back again. Am I right? Right. Why would you go back? Would you go back to Disney World? That for myself. No. I mean, when you're a little kid. Sure. A little bit older. Like another week or two. And you'll put around one of those wild rides and hope. Hope for the best. But anyway. See George is happy to see me not because I look at any different than usual. In fact, I look a little bit better because I had an haircut. Yeah. I'll never. Huh? You're fit. No, I'm not. I'm fat. In fact, I had lost a little bit. Then I came back here in a couple of days sitting on my ass with my irritable bowel and my gigantic floating turds. I'm, I'm blue. This can't last. This is not going to work. What? You're walking more. So you can see there's more blood circulating through your body. Your heart's better. You have more color in your face. As opposed to being a stagnant love. Black I would be after we cure. Right. But the only reason George is happy to see me is because I brought him pulling for column by him. Thank you on DVD no less. I haven't watched the the other disc in with all the I can't wait to watch that. I'll bring it back. No, I don't know what you'd damn right you'll bring it back. But the I don't even know which is the most fascinating part. The interview with Charlotton Heston, which is toward the end, which is just. It was just pee in your pants laughing. I mean, he makes a monkey out of him. It's it's a beautiful thing. And by the way, Charlotton Heston, we're glad that you're sick and dying. You son of a man. And we're glad that you got although it's bad that he's got Alzheimer's because he ought to remember everything real distinctly so every time somebody dies from from a handgun. And he thinks about it and remembers it and savers it. And Michael more keeps holding up the picture this little girl. Which is a long story who died in Flint, Michigan from a handgun. And he just keeps walking away and walking away. So as he leaves the house, he he props the picture up against the stone thing. The stone hinge out in front. And Dick Clark, up until I saw that movie, I was like Dick Clark. He should only rot. Okay, I'm glad that now he started looking really old. He's making up for lost time. Yeah, so you don't like Dick anymore. I don't allow. Let me just say this. I don't like Dick Clark. I do like Clark bars. Clark Kent. And I do like. But as far as Dick Clark is concerned, he should die or work in death. In fact, I hope he ages a lot in the next year. Bob, third man. Yeah. If he lives that long. Makes me sick. And he he he he's in a van. I pointed the story. And he's in a van with all his cromies and flunkies. And Michael Morris can fronning him about that restaurant. He had up there in the Flint where he had all that the welfare. Mama's a work in their payment minimum wage and abusing them. And the kid of Adam on go to Australia. But you'll see it. Yeah. Can't wait. In fact, the movie is so good that I taped that put on cassette just a little blurb of the cartoon about the history of America. Now it's time for a free pitch really. And I think they're so America. Oh, boys and girls ready to get started. What's about it? I'm there with these people in Europe called Filters. And they were afraid of being a first kid. So they all got a boat with failed to the new world. But they wouldn't have to be scared. Am I right? Oh, I'm so in that. I feel so much safer for this. Soon as they arrived, they were greeted by the And they got scared. And I'm wondering if you can. So the killer. Now do things. Why have I raised the people with calm down? No. And said they saw the game front of the city. Which is the old neighborhood. Which is in 1775. They saw the kill in the British. Who they could be, Bree. And it works. But they killed it if you say. So these asked the second members. Which said, every what man could keep his gun. I love my gun. No, my gun. It brings us to the genius out here up slavery. Disabled girls. But what people back then were up to afraid of doing any work. So they was up to go. Kind of thousands of black people broke the back of me. And forced them to have very hard for no money. And I don't mean no money like our kid. Well, Martin make no money. I mean zero dollars. Nothing. Not a sin. Do it. That way, they made the USA the richest country in the world. So did have it all that money. And Bree helped calm the white people down. No. They got even more than for that. Because that's the 200 years of slavery. The black people now up. Number of the white people in many parts of the South. Where you can free my debt for payments. The slaves started repelling. They were uprooted. And all that stood there got shut off. And when white people heard of this, they were freaking out and going, oh no real. Don't kill me, make black people. Well, dust in the nick of time, hate, semi-welcos. Who were 1836 invented the first weapon ever. They took you find all that over without having the renal. And all the same. I was like, yeah, yeah. But it was too late. The Norths who were on the place were freezing. Yep, they were free now to go stop all the old masses. It's all. And everybody was like, oh no, we're gonna die. But the three slaves took no revenge. They just wanted to live in peace. But your couldn't convince the white people of this. So they formed a coup of plan. And in 1871, the semi-utacland became an ill legal terrorist organization. Another purpose found it. A national rifle association. Two politicians tapped one of the first gun laws. Making it illegal for any black person to own one. It was a great year for America. The KKK and the NRA. Of course they had nothing to do with each other. And this was just a poisonous. One group illegally promoted responsible gun ownership. And the other groups are endless black people. And that's the way it was all the way to Latin. It's divided. When a black woman broke the law, but refusing to move to the back of the bus. Why people just couldn't believe it? Why won't they know? Who's going on, man? Oh, hell, bro, who's black people everywhere. So it's a man and they're right. And why people had a major freak and feel themselves. And they were all like, oh, hey, what? What? And they did. They all ran flee into the suburbs where it was all wired at safe and clean. And they went out in the bottom quarter of a billion guns. And put locks on the doors along in the houses and gave brown linators. And finally they were all safe and secure and snug as a bird. And everyone, they're happy. Ever. Hey, man. Pulling for columbine. Hey, man. Pulling for columbine. I think probably who did that with a guy who do so park as a interview to one of them went to the house. The voices are alive. Yeah, he interviewed them. And he pointed out that they were like, you know, high school dropouts and faders. Been stetical and ensued up a bunch of people. They invented some park. Created it and done it. There's a couple of south park clips in it's cute. Anyway, pulling for columbine. You ought to be in your music at your video music whatever's store right now. Renting buying stealing a copy of that. Holding the place up just to get you a copy. I'm, it's phenomenal. I watched it again yesterday. And then when he goes up into Canada, they goes into a sarnia Ontario, 73,000 people where they had one murder last year. Then he goes down to a Windsor Ontario. He said, well, this 400,000 people are a bunch of a lot of murders. And he has to talk about a half dozen people before he finally remembers. He finds one guy, remember, is a murderer a couple of years ago in Windsor. And he says, yeah, but that was a guy from Detroit who came over from Detroit with a gun that he bought him in a soda and killed somebody. And that was it. That was the only murder they can remember in Windsor in years. And then his when he goes into Toronto and starts walking around, house house door to door. And then the doors are unlocked. He just keeps open up people's front door and, oh, excuse me, but I just wanted to see. And then find the last guy that he opens up the door. He says, well, thanks for letting us in. Thanks for not shooting me. It was a cute thing. But that's the difference between being civilized and uncivilized boys and girls. That's the biggest difference. That's what, and see, I found out from watching that that Canadians have guns up the ass because they're big hunters. But they don't kill each other with them. That's the difference because in America. That's the American fucking way. Exactly. That's the way we resolve things. Maybe we need a good national course in anger management. Ha ha ha ha ha. Anger management, we're pretty pissed off about the way this thing sounds in here, George Corsoff. Yeah. And screw in. We're pissed off at the way you look. Yeah. Well, and do you hear how bad that sounds? It's wrong. No, listen to that. I don't know. And I think it's all to come through one speaker. Definitely. It's only coming through the left speaker. This, this speaker says. I want, we got our program director and our operations mangleer in here. I just want to announce to both of them are both so pleased to see me. That this studio is at a disgrace. It's an embarrassment to the guy that brought casting industry. I can't believe on a high rated show like this. I come in here. You can pick all the dingle birds out of my ass you want. But it would be a hell of a lot preferable since I'm not to be on suckups. Sucking yes, but suckups know. Uh, they have a studio that sounded right. This is, this is garbage. This really, this is the, I think right now is the worst ever. And that's covering a lot of territory. It's totally different from Friday by the way. Yeah, because this is my welcome home. I guess probably Corsough was in here over the weekend. Fine, tuning and didn't was stuff to make sure that would piss me off. In the dolphin season, they had to broadcast all these games. They can take their dolphins and stuff them up their ass. Okay. And by the way, J. Feeder blows. J. Feeder's at a disgrace. I mean, he always tries hard. He's just marginally his mediocre. Yeah. You follow what I'm saying? You know, he reminds me of the big, tries hard, but he's mediocre. And it's all he'll ever be. See on the schedule that he now thank God. I mean, I don't, why do I keep picking on him? I don't know why. I probably shouldn't cause Hank's not in town anyway. Well, Hank likes it because he don't like him. What does Hank, Hank doesn't like Orlando, I'll say, Query, okay? I don't know what it's all about. He don't like him. Who would you rather hear? The big go or the big Joe Z. Oh, I don't listen. I see. Teeter, one of them. But now that we found out that Joe Z is the secret weapon. He's got those big numbers filling all summer for Hank. That's right. I think we need to get on right away. I think you owe him a little apology. No. By the way, Joe, I'm glad you didn't die in a plane crash. I don't dislike Joe's a gadget. I can personally, he's a good guy. He's probably the most boring guy in the world. He does deserve that name penis face, but other than that. Huh? Now you see him. You know he's old penis face. Rink about it for me. You don't see the resemblance. I'm sorry. Without the foreskin thing, goodness. You never recognize him if he had the foreskin. Oh, that's come to where it's hurtled. There you go. That's not a bad idea. Joe's a gadget and it turned like we'd probably get censored. He probably wouldn't be able to be on here. Uh, what's his name?

So I said he said this studio blows and I said you're absolutely correct. He did a mistake, vision to peace-mate, a cover-in-that-hole-la-perian soil, you're fixing that whole thing with weapons that we brain, spell more turmoil beginning to boil. We stay in our time again and live here we have no. That's a looming. Searching for our pieces for ourselves. Some people claim we got George Bush to blame, but it's not a good thing you're right. It's so George Bush's fault. I say in peace-representies to start a new- Yeah! Put it like this redneck asshole judge more in Alabama. Is this pathetic? Oh, can't stay that way. How long does this crap go on? You don't lie. Yeah. Federal courts is, in fact, one of the discussions other talking has yesterday, this had no point in even discussing any more of the constitutionality, which is an open-and-shark case anyway. But the federal court is said, get that thing out of there, and that's it. And that's, there's nothing else to talk about. He's going to do that. But the good Christians are all slump in air, man, and they're all running there, and well, what's wrong with the... See, this is what America's all about as intolerance. That's another great thing about Canada. In fact, I've been reading many articles about that of Lady, is how the separation of church and state is much, much stronger in Canada than it is in the USA. In fact, when the Pope was given John Crayon, all that crap about the gay marriages, and he said, and there were towncretion. His soul was going to rot in the hell. They were trying to save his eternal soul, all that crap, you know? And he said, well, I have to take that chance. I'll have to deal with my faith because in this country in Canada, we have separation of church and state as much more important than the idea of it in all that's said, right? Just like Kennedy. Same thing. Same crap. Although, can the Kennedy's a course where much better clerks and more clever than John Crayon, but nonetheless, hey, don't, don't knock a froggy, okay? He doesn't need to want to sit. Bush was a moron way back when before some of these people were in denial here until they finally found out he was not only a moron, but a liar in dangerous. And we got these kids dying over their every day. We're in a quagmire baby. We're in a quagmire. We're stuck. And now I've can't stand starting to blow up again in the Taliban or making a resurgence. And there's Americans dying. I'm not a goddamn world. Didn't we fix that problem? Oh, yeah, we took his. We, we, we, we, we, we turned, what's that expression about? We sucked tail and ran or how did that goes? Turn tail. Yeah, we sucked the tail. And ran. Filling cross brings was very astute. Pick it on poor Eric. Boy, what, what's the response of these for real? Is this a joke? Huh? Could be some free. No, we got a hundred ninety two votes in like a half an hour on his pull here already. Holy, holy, don't thought. I sure miss Rick Weaver. You know what I'm going to lose dolphin games? But Phil points out that the Eric is dumb. He says the stupidity of the American people is an Eric spelled jewelry. J E W as in Jew. E R E L Y. Jew yearly were. Jew yearly. Jew werely. Jew werely. J E W E. Jewel L R Y. Yeah, I haven't even liked to say it before I can spell it. R Y. Jewel R Y. Jew R us. Oh, and they do have all Martin K Martin and Canada by the way. And, uh, what, but not like where I am. In other words, I'm the suburb. But you'll see you'll be very pleased with Michael more that he and his lady they went into Kmart and they got them to stop selling bullets. Probably like that. Yeah, they did. They got Kmart to stop selling bullets. Until they left. And then they got a bit on there with Chris Rock where he's saying a stand up that we're talking about. Uh, bullets should be 5,000 bucks a piece. It doesn't okay, but they should search urgent 5,000 bucks for bullet. There you go. And then you know, you'd run around saying, I'd have to kill you if I could afford to. You know, stuff like that. You'd have to really want to kill the ride real bad. Since there wouldn't be no, uh, drive, there wouldn't be no, uh, innocent bystanders getting shot. Right. That's it. So anyway, thanks to Phil O'Crol Springs. That's really good. We'll take a call or two if we get any here. I don't know. I have my doubts. All over everybody's concentrating on a poll. Which of these things bugs you the most? We got 200 votes. These stupidity American public. That was my vote 81. I score on the elegant. You got your thumb right on it. It's frightening. It's scary. It is so freaking scary. Just like the thing in Alabama and just like Arnold and California all the sudden nonsense. I mean, the public in this country should be concentrating on the effect that they're losing their goddamn freedoms. We got a president and all his cronies are a bunch of liars. We have a guy they may elect a electrical grid in this country that's so our kick that any minute we got. We'll be sitting here like a, uh, dealing with ourselves in the dark. House of Freaking cards. It is. On the end, fact number two is George W. Bush being a moron 43 tied with people who won't speak English 43. Well, he's a moron in any language. How do you like that, you know? Oh, great. Right. Mo Howard David 14. He's small potatoes in this poll. You're, you're, you're the no more these are wins for more. Absolutely. George filling in for Neals only got 12 C. We've even smaller taters so far. You're like Tater tots. You've seen them. Tater tots. Onward running for governor four sports nerds too. People would tons of body jewelry. One and assholes covered with tattoos. No, I guess I must be the only one. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't have sure which one it abolished. We most people would read here or people would lots of tattoos. Throw it the red heads. They can, I haven't a version to them. Really? You never told you that? No, I don't think it's up with a little. I don't know. You're all a crap. I mentioned it on here a million times. But, but, but, but, but, but, but. At least. I understand.

Washington she was one among many bills solicited during the White House years Jennifer Fowers claimed she'd had a 12 year affair with him this was completely in character for Bill my favorite was Monica Lewinsky they'll talk to her a few times and she had asked him for some job hunting help and drop to her knees to kiss my husband I came to know and like her and I asked her if she wanted to

about the big oh which I think is he's aptly named because he is a big oh you only reads in his eyes because he used to say Q and after the 40 thousand time I got a little old yeah you're right but I'm glad he's gonna get that the Mark Morgan stole it from him I'm okay have a great day pal thank you buddy see on Q a M Q a M hold it here and say that on Channel 4 maybe that'll make Angela Ray

now you're going to be for Arnold because he's for the criminalization of marijuana that's all was enough to make me gag you know can he was serious that's the right part of the whole thing he was really cereal sad very sad okay tragic almost his tragic is this fact says if you heard about this group of people two or three on the internet who are blasting Michael Moore's bowling for colombine movie on websites like and it's got that we've hoped the answer it's a why why do we care who cares they do why I don't see that's a good model for all your kids out there don't pay attention to assholes okay I mean there's so many assholes on the internet we couldn't even begin to count they don't have numbers to go that high so why would you pay any attention especially when you know it's just a limited fringe number of morons okay and probably also inspired by like newsmax dot comment or the gun huggers the uh help and has been suckers don't forget what I told you when you see that interview with him on your you're just gonna go freak out I saw most of it they showed you did on a documentary about Michael Moore yeah for one of those stories like uh did you see the hardware he

come in and say that to you so what does that take because they're always picking on your little ass just like what we've always picking on his fad old ass here's the facemorea who says I finally got a chance to watch for now we're talking bowling for column by last night I have to say it was the best twenty bucks I ever spent I find myself in treating aggravated at the same time I went to bed last night with my mind just spinning as I'm writing this you're talking about Charlotton has been in dick Clark and I could not agree with you more in other words I'm as usual what assholes Maria says I never thought too much a Charlotton has been but dick Clark really surprised me it's terrible it is company looks for tax breaks because they're people working for them who are in the welfare to work program Chuck has to be ashamed of himself for traveling the Denver and Flint with the NRA just shortly after each of these tragedies took place I was stunned when I saw those morons in the Michigan militia group at the beginning of the movie it's hard for me to believe that there are people out there with that kind of mentality they take into such extremes Michael Moore's awesome for bringing to light the fact that the american media has made us all of her oh yeah there's one scene in their way showing in Canada what they're watching I thought about this what they're watching the news right and how they're not like so now why is that fast machine dialing right now and I can hear it what do you do I just send a fact to Eric that that was plural minutes ago remember maybe it's just getting around to it baby baby let's make him be mean to an all kinds of crap I can hear air hitting on the other end of it Maria says Michael Moore is awesome for bringing to light the fact that the american media has made us all afraid of our own shadows that big business is benefiting from that fear kudos to Marilyn Manson and came out it's a hit a great day quite to marks his Maria thanks Maria what it's an excellent animal look at it Marilyn Manson was really good on air but like julee roman says in Marilyn Manson it's the most significant I'm gonna tell you something right now julee roman needs to be railroaded right out of town okay he needs to be run out of ten needs to be tardent feathered piece of crap WQAM speaking they know what's going on how you know the best thing is sharpened has that the enemy has that picture of Moses behind you know that yeah unbelievable and the thing that was the great for Moses took the steroids the craziest thing was neat man asked about the ethnicity thing he goes it's really because it started with it's we have a problem with him was there a problem with black people and he's a little bit more than a question said it all started with the civil rights movement yeah I'm also on my channel man and in other words the this what he's really trying to say is the fiction the spooks we have too many of them work and it ones that are shooting everybody that is absolutely incredible and black on the more goes right to those scenes from Canada and shows that 30% of the population is non-white in Canada and they've got to help a lot

Gun Advocate start pink pistols, check their enniscient in. The pink pistols are calling them. Yeah. I got a pink pistol. Little one. It shoots straight. Lessley Michigan. Not like Peter North for close. The gay rights usually are seen as part of the liberal agenda with gun rights of interest to conservatives. So gays with guns cut across the grain of America's political landscape. It says. That's just fine with Albert Low who's starting a Michigan chapter of the pink pistols. A gay gun rights group with 37 chapters in the west and least 5,000 members. I'm politically incorrect totally. The lesley resident told the Detroit Free Press for a Monday story. If the group takes hold in Michigan as it has in places such as California and Tennessee, the state could have a new set of hobby target tutors and a broader stronger gun rights lobby. This is the aim of low who's in the early stages of building membership. And if some traditional gun rights owners which are eager to gain support. The more the myrior in that battle, I wonder if that was a plan words you think? The more the myrior in that battle said Chuck Peracone executive director the music and coalition for responsible gun owners. As long as they're supportive of the underlying issue which is self defense, we welcome their support. A few years ago while living in Chicago, lowmed Doug Crick, who started the first pink pistols group in Boston and started a website. How do you like that? And now there's pink pistols all across America popping up. That's proud enough. You could be the pink pistolero.

Bush being a moron 62. People are also thinking there's 61. George Philly and Phineal 31. How do you like that only 31? George, that's a pretty low number. More Howard David at only 21. Boy, he's really falling out of grace. Absolutely. People with tons of body jewelry 5, Arnold Runnerford Governor 5, assholes covered with tattoos 3 and sports nerds only appear.

Once you can see in ones that you're positive are there but you can't see and you don't want to see? The tattoo. Who's speaking Carlos at our reception desk? I've seen some tattoo schemes that don't look so bad and then others that do. Oh, just grosses me out. And the worst part. And usually it's on people that don't look good anyway. Right. But when you see somebody that's good looking and they're covered with tattoos, you think? What a waste. It's just like when I see a good guy walk, a good looking guy walking down the street with some bitch. And that's what I think. What a waste. What are you laughing about? Thought what she's thinking. I don't care. Well, he's that's what he's thinking because maybe she's got like a 21 inch waste. Huh? That's what I spagged think when we see a really hot young guy walking on a street and invariably there's some damn bitch. Walk in arm and arm. She's got her hand on his ass or a hand around his waist. And we always think what a freaking waste. It is a waste. You can have the guy I'll take the grill. Okay, sounds like a winner to me.

Was their name a slang word for the male sexual organ? We certainly hope so. Otherwise there's a f*** all interesting about the verb pipe. We were meant to flash now. Look at Topey before the name Verf pipe doesn't mean anything. We pulled it out of a hat. Don't listen to him. It means penis. Tell him it means penis you moron. Verf pipe founder Brian Vanderarch has been arguing with the band's manager Slappy Gold since 1996. These artistic types don't understand that sex sells. It doesn't mean penis. Of course it does. Put it together. What does Verf mean? It means energy. Viga. And what's a pipe? A cylindrical object. A long shaft. It's so facto. You got a long shaft that's full of Viga. A f*** you hapless mother f***er. There you go. Well yeah look. You're the one who said we should release those other singles to try and cash in on freshmen. As the argument escalated, Vanderarch tunted Slappy with his decision to release more singles. Each representing a different grade level. We were merely soft moors. We were merely juniors. We were underpass. Right. So it didn't work. Verf pipe still means a thunderous unbridled erection. Does not know what you always bring up this. The Verf pipe. Maybe the name means penis. Maybe it doesn't. It probably doesn't matter when you're dealing with a f***er with sons of f*** like these. It's a big juicy, stopping weddle like a show business. Tonight. Uninside them behind. I bet you broke a Brian Remembers K-Winging on Verf Records and more. That was never the song from the movie Mando Coney. I saw that movie. Did you? I thought we were interesting. That song was a bit my theme song long time ago. Really. But a hundred years ago. And. Yeah. Strange stuff in that movie. Was it? Mando Coney. And then what Michael said to his sister. 12 16 at five, 16, WQAM. Oh, here's a facts from Jane Boynton B2 says. I also saw bowling for colabina thought it was done very well. My only complaint, of course I have a complaint being from South Florida, was that Michael Moore didn't really pinpoint his absolute number one cost for the gun violence in America. I interrupt this facts, yes I can, because Jay, I don't think Michael Moore was putting himself in a position of having all the answers. He was just laying out to you the way it is. And pointing out that they're a variety, you know, it's not like, you know, take this pill and all of these things will go away. The instant cure. It's a report not a conclusion. It says he's, look at that. Did you see what just fell out of my eye? No, Bouger. To live. Says he spread the blame around plenty, but it came off toothed on each reason because there were so many factors he cited. I still loved a pathotic could have been better. He would have focused his top three reasons only. Ha ha ha. Just curious if you would agree with that. No, I would not. Jay. Have you seen the big La Bowsky Jay wants to know? I have not seen the big La Bowsky except on TV spots. She's a cow. Now were you the one tell me I should see it or not? Not me. I'll ever say it. Oh, and of course would I pay an attention that thing, no. The thing. Hey, we got a thing, Philist, let's, let's hire the thing. And then at the bottom of his face, Jay, in small print. But this is the most important part. It says, please. Please stop playing the hour long bids. Maybe you could cut it down to a half an hour, but a whole hour per day songs sends me to the dial. It says, well, let's fight out. There are no showers. Since there are no calls on the board right now anyway, there's not a single call on there. It's Monday. It's still, we're like in limbo. The kids are back in school, but a whole lot of people are still in vacation. And the people who are back in town are after the weekend. They're like, is this rambling? This is the ultimate Monday. Right. Looking busy anyway. Trying to like pretend that they got, you know, their life in order. They're going to try to put it in order. Like they're doing some real work. Not around here, though. Not around here because nobody cares because school is marching up in a, I'm not joking when I talk. You know me, I would never pick out a way somebody looks, no, especially the way I look.

That's all I wanted to know. By the way, George is the absolute works. Okay. Thanks. I see. Oh, here's the facts. Is a pouring off to the show. Here's that story about the autistic boy dies at Healing Service. Oh, it was bad enough when I called it him, but to see this in print from the Associated Press Milwaukee. An autistic eight year old boy died while being restrained during a church prayer service held in an attempt to cure him. And one man connected with a small stir front church was arrested. Police in a church official said yesterday. The boys mother took him to the faith temple church of the apostolic faith for the healing service Friday night. You religious people are the crazy people on town you're right now. That's the little correct. Several church members prayed over him for more than an hour until somebody noticed he wasn't moving and called 911 said Bishop David Hempill senior. Hempill said the boy and his mother had been going to the prayer services for the past three weeks. Members of the church made up of just six families prayed for God to release the evil spirits that caused the boys illness he said. And where the hell did they get the where did they get that from the exorcist that they're playing on a forl show by the way that I heard this morning coming in. That's the whole place you'll tell us you where they get that who you're. Huh? They have their own uh you know stuff. That's their own stuff possibly or somebody came in here and took it and stole it maybe. That's okay for all can I have it. Don't do it again pal. The boy just had a problem in his mind of what we were doing was asking God the fixed at Hempill said he chose to fix it by taking him back home to him. Oh there we go an ethical crap again. He called him home. All I know is we're not guilty of anything you said church members wrapped the boy in sheets. To keep him from scratching himself and others but the boy was allowed to sit anyway that he feels comfortable Hempill said police would not say what the man could be charged with only that they were waiting the results of an autopsy. If he died which I heard they doubt of some natural cause he won't be charged with anything to serious police captain Linda Haynes. He said she did not believe the boy had been structuring the service. Police would not identify the man who was arrested but Hempill said it was his brother Ray Hempill another minister at the church. We believe that according to the board of God a person could get evil spirited spiritedness he said. Either God is going to have to deliver or we're going to have to do whatever we can until things get better. The church is not connected when he larger denominations has only six families together twice a week to pray and discuss scripture Hempill said. The church's main window was boarded up Sunday as were those of several businesses that neighbor it in a rundown strip ball on the city's northwest corner. This is in Milwaukee. Honey like that. Boarded up. High tail of the town. The exces of didn't work. The power of Christ to praise you. The power of Christ to praise you. The power of Christ to praise you. The power of Christ to praise you. The power of Christ to praise you. The power of Christ to praise you. You turned. The power of Christ to praise you. I got the wrong buttons here because it don't match. See that was another great thing that our good friend that was his name did before he left. Julio. I like fat Julio is a good guy but you know when you're going to make the board one I'm making matching pots you know what I'm saying. I'm saying good idea. Sure. I got to make it a little bit too much sense. But anyway. So that was my bad. So now we're even one bad for George one bad for Neil. I feel better. And several bads for the whole audience. Now that cause have been a pretty damn weak. Look at a pole though man. A pole results on there. Spectacular 374 votes. And it's only about 12. 30. Which of these things bugs you the most?

Oh, I'm doing it. They're investing it with mid-hours to help make it grow. So they can spend a lot more. I mentioned mid-hours just now. Oh, send a chill up and down my spine. I mean, can you imagine what kind of person would have put me in touch with a guy like mid-hours? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and then not pay me the 14 bucks from that lottery ticket. I mean, oh, you can swing it. I can swing what? A golf club just said, I might just do that right at the doctor. Why he's going to be at the doctor's anyway? You know, right?

I mean, the first day back to the full schedule. In fact, I hate to, I, you know, I'm going to be honest like I try to be as much as possible when it's not dangerous. But I mean, the prospect of coming back to this five days a week. I don't, I don't, I don't remember how it was last year. But I continue this year. It's not a pretty, you know what I mean? No, because I mean, you're older. I guess it's a real easy or something like that. No, I didn't look forward to it. I mean. No. No, I'm not. I've been thinking about it and thinking about it. I kept thinking, God, that Tuesday and Thursday thing was, it was just perfect. It was like every week in the fourth day or it couldn't be any better. And then after Thursday, it like two o'clock then you're off the rest of Thursday and you got Friday and Saturday and Sunday and Monday. That's four and a half days. It's like having a beyond vacation every guy named week about Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and Saturday and Sunday. You mean off? No, aren't. In other words, working just Monday? They'll take Monday and Friday off so you can have four day weekends. Yeah, three days a week in the middle. Take Monday and Friday off and then of course Wednesday because that's the one to two comedy bits are normally anyway. We just hope it's. So it's like I said, you work two of the answers. I do.

I keep room so you're in a special reason why you're bringing me this crap about these little kids playing a baseball so we can analyze it at length 10 minutes after one at five 60 WC coming that's what we're only doing three breaks the star this is good. You want to try save this Steven Because your read is number you'll put it on the website you get us in all kinds of trouble just like that stuff What does the emails that almost got you fired? Oh, we'll put it on our wet all those damn emails from poor mode and nearly cost you your job You'd be out there washing dishes at goddamn of burger king right now And they didn't even have any dishes five six seven oh five 60 pound five and see this is what they wanted to want it to To our anyone in the comedy, but I don't we haven't gunning calls got a call on one line scream us I thought it was a fine idea because we still are we still are way short of a full load in this town And more and more ways than one we got a load alright But not the kind we're looking for There's a lot of people out there if they don't have to have to come rushing back in to send their kids back to school There are a lot of people like all over the goddamn world. Oh, I've finally speaking about over the world. How about those 10,000 friends who died while you're off Shirok was vacationing in Quebec a They had it coming How do you like that they should have gone swimming 10,000 people? I went to high school in cannon day when New York Guess what the population was 10,000 right? That's like it's like you wake up one morning everybody's dead. They're all gone. So make it by by Amazing 10,000 friendsman died of course. I'm thinking of myself. I'm happy all bad How about I should probably admit that I understand the old people dying of heat stroke and they can't get out Yeah, what's everybody else's excuse it's hot get a drink go swimming And how do you know any young people died it had to have been maybe one or two They said it was all old people about except maybe but turn man maybe that still old people died Maybe it's something we can think about for like sunrise That's a good point here. So the sweltering heat our old people don't die they just keep multiplying Oh But they do get a good big melon on out there Sure, it's good go out there walk around and they have those the rain catch your hats, you know, it's terrific And the and the duck bill glass attachment and the checkered pants Or the lime green or lemon lemon yellow doesn't look paper From an it's after one at five 60 it's our one to two hour you for one I had a lot of calls on here, but I'd like I told you before I'll get around it or maybe not I don't know I'm just rambling here.

Okay, but that's for hump day that we need that We need that badly If any of these assholes out there had any idea what this is like five goddamn days a week four hours a day It was seriously I thought of the prospect of that.

That's one 866 785 pass Howard david's the bitch Thait Uh It's all a little, I feel my vowels lose good throat, not a totally... And there's a smell that makes you cry... So, man, I can barely see my knees as I make my screen in speakers' wings, I don't even spoil it... It's not hard to understand... In the diabetic, fat man... It can't kill anyone's up there, being on the sea... It's so goddamn embarrassing... Everybody's making fun of me... And just with the fancy gate... Every thought through it's all a bit late... A super sound at night... When you do change the side by hold it, man... Looks kind of rockin' rollin' on the toilet... 122 at 5.60 WQAM... So, somebody fangs his me, this article says... Keller makes noise by grabbing the pool and they write, Neil, don't we all? But underneath that's kind of cute, marginal. Underneath it it says, have you mentioned the murderer of the fine father gig? Anyway, what's there to say? What is there to say? This is so bad, and then this came back again like this, I don't know where... After the last breath, I didn't do nothing. The speakers in here are so screwed up... And engineering department in this goddamn radio station are so incompetent... And it's not unbelievable! It sounds like I'm gonna goddamn echo chamber the whole time here today... Only in it comes and it goes and it comes, squirt squirt and it goes... You know what I'm saying? No, what? Spastic, that's the word for the studio, it's a spastic studio. Can't you tell? Can't you hear it? Yeah. Sounds like I'm gonna goddamn burrow like I'm gonna go over an agrofault or something... And quite frankly, not a bad idea. Wait, today's this fashion made in. She says it's been a soggy summer in New Jersey, but you've always brightened my day. Welcome back is not an order because I feel you never really left. You have your finger on the button wherever you are. Cool, also jerks it to find job, you just need to get used to them. I like your... What? I'll take it. I like your bedtime stories and cut up on civil movies from your movie list. Sarah Gulfar, aka Rick, we'm haunted me for days, but bowling for combat will stay with me forever. I watched it three times, it should be required viewing for all schools and everybody. What surprised me was the dick-larke refused the refusal to talk to Michael. I grew up watching dick on TV now field he's seen and disappointed he's done. The interview with Heston didn't surprise, but angered me even more. Don't these guys know or care what the public will think? No. Then Nadine goes on, who evidently is taking some heavy hallucinogens and she says, I'm a bit surprised that you didn't love pirates of the Caribbean. Your comment was that Johnny did a little Richard thing, well maybe a little. I thought he was outstanding in gorgeous. I'm a big fan of his and especially one of your biggest fans. Talk to you when the phones are not so busy. And as I read that the first time I read what it calls on there. But I didn't see powers of the Caribbean. You said that. I didn't say he did a little Richard. Well, somebody must have said that because I never saw it. I said he wasn't so sure he was acting drunk. All the reviews are read so the movie was marginal, but he was great. Exactly. That's right. He carried the whole thing in a movie that was a week, but that he was spectacular. I like Johnny, you're ringing. When you talk, I hear a ringing. And I like exactly that it's like I'm in a barrel. This is a disaster. This is a technical freaking disaster. It's like the mic is made of aluminum. Do you know what I'm talking about? Like it's like it's lined with aluminum foil. How's it now? A little bit better? Oh, actually is better. Ha ha ha ha. There you go. Wow. There you go. And you'll fish it. Nice work. What a bunch of crappy. I heard for all this more I'm bitching about the crappy mic in there. So all he's got to do is touch it and it falls apart. And the mic too. The home of technical incompetence. This right on the heels of that big trend Thursday. Everybody's you fork, raw running around, we're number one. We're kicking ass. And what do they reward us with? The cheapest, the crappiest, the nastiest, swill as an excuse for a radio station ever seen in my life. This place is a freaking joke. No wonder the guy named Beesley. You know who that probably is in my attic? It's not wild animals. It's probably the Beesley's. Which will they? They probably hopped out of the tree and moved into my attic. The freaking Beesley's all of them from there. They're naples away. Maybe they can do visit to welcome me back. All those retars up there with their little bans, those with their ukuleleys. Whatever to help us strum. The freaking Beesley's. Isn't that of course we got a great grade. Wouldn't win with I ain't seen him yet today. Where to house eat? What is welcoming committee? How where to house eat? Come as waltzin in here on Thursday. Good job Neil. Good job. And then probably ran out of here like a lightning struck his ass. Probably flew out of here. Yeah. I can't watch that. Shmuck. Anyway, the poll is spectacular today. We're getting a big response which means that there are people back because they're pinning the S kids went back to school. That's good. They don't want to be here. No, good. No, they don't. 501 votes. See if I'd move my glass. I might hit the right. Oh, see that's what I want to hit. 501. Which of these things bugs you the most? We should have put on their EQM engineering department. That would have been my vote. I would have changed my vote. But I did vote for the stupidity-demirkin public and so did most everybody else. I did vote for the 18 votes out of 504. People who won't speak English 92. Oh, great. George W. Bush being a moron 91. George filling in for Neil 49. Not that's under 10%. It's usually 20. More Howard David at 29. Look at that. Well, look at that. George filling in for Neil 49. And Mo. Only 29. How do you like that? Does that vote for Neil? Not. Now, city or right though, the most factor is fading because as he disappears deeper in the night, when he winds up being on from like 230 to 330. Yeah. Didn't do any damage. Then they would not be any vote because they'll be doing it. They'll all be for like who's more Howard David again. As well as covered with tattoos eight, our running for governor seven, people were tons of body jewelry six and sports. There's only four out of 504. Pretty weak. Only on this station where we get only four for that. Tommy's not too happy about the fact that the engineering department sucks either because they screwed up all of his expensive equipment in there this weekend also. All of the, uh, the for nizers and five into the whole crazy. All of that crap. Well, at least we still have it, you know, tape together glued together with Elmer's glue. But even pissed on at this weekend and screwed it all up. Poor little Tommy. You thought his voice was squeaky before. Where did he hear it now? What? Oh, it's going to sound like crap. You're going to have a tinny mic like that. They probably did this on purpose. You know, it's the fact Mike now they did. That's probably, uh, what's his name from over in the Naples. Bob Vermouth. He probably came over here and didle with us over the weekend. Make me sound even, although he, he couldn't, I don't know when you were here, but he figured you couldn't sound more queen than you do already. George. Yeah. See how everybody's looking at each other. Not you, Tommy. That this time. Well, Tommy always sounds queen. He sounds like a fruit cake. But he's not. He's a good guy. And he looks a lot better with that crap off. Jesus. Thank God. What? What are you laughing about? He looks a lot better. It'll be back. It's coming back. He'll do something. He said you're full of crap. He just gave you like four fingers. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 50 in a glass. No less. That was very generous. I'm, I'm in coherent because I'm not programmed for this. I was programmed for like 10 to one today. And the big one. But the audience said, oh, no, don't do that. Don't go cop it out now. Don't go squeeze that hour out. This is back to business now. Okay. I still can't believe. This speaker up here on my left on your right. This, I'm going to take, I'm going to take a good day in baseball bat and just smash it to smithereens. It's how bad it sounds. It's annoying. Wait. Huh? Smash it. VIP Sportsbook.com is outflowed as favorite sportsbook. They've been here for years.

No Marlon's game today. Marlon's won yesterday. Broke the 5 game losing streak. Any interest? No. Didn't think so. Sam afraid to turn the overhead up because it's so goddamn tinny now. Don't forget to besten the Alonar website. Neil Rogers.com. Besten the LCD 2002 2003. And the more Howard David had keychain. There you go. What's not to lie? All the proceeds go. The profits go to a abandoned pay rescue. 1470 and 15 cent. How do we get 15 cent? Posted channeling cozys. Yeah. I don't know. They subtract whatever the cost of their manufacturing from the cozys and the mugs and whatnot. Well wait a minute. It says net. What does that mean? This is after the expense of the cost of them. You know what the CDs we pay for that up front. No. So that's all pure profit. But they produced some of those other things. Yeah. So they take their cost out of it. So another percentage net. Yeah. Well I'm so that's good. Yeah. So that's not such a bad start. What are you belly again about? Oh, my belly. 1470 and 15 cent. But kid on their right away. And then of course Wednesday McGill is going to be a brandy's at a time to be determined. What did I just get through saying? Like only say I can go. I said this is Vokobar. I'm going to be coming here right now. The door opens up and there's his ballchone ahead. I'll be God damn. And they'll don't ask me because I got to go to my doctor's appointment. I got to go get pills. That's the only reason I go to a doctor in South Florida so I can get prescriptions written. Because I wouldn't even let them touch me down here. Butchers. Other than doctor hamph which he's the best. Other than that. Nothing but a bunch of butchers and fakers down here. Most of whom just probably rolled in off the banana boat. Speaking of that. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T line. WQAM. Hey. Have you heard of this George? This is George. What can I do? This one is fucking me when you get to him. Okay. Where are you calling from? I'll pour a lot of that. Let's go to 4-Laterdale. Hello. Hey. How are you doing? Pretty good. Alright. That's your voice. I can hear it. Hey listen. How do you want? How do you go about getting them out of the bus you see these? If you don't have a website or computer like a Porsche Leper like I don't. Well I guess the only thing you can do is come to our one of our drive-by shooting. I mean one of our things. Okay. Where were you located for a lot of now? I don't know. Yeah. Like what matters actually. Well, the popular one is that far away from you. Uh, was that a love at the bookstore? No, no. No, not the adult bookstore. The Brandy Shoes. Oh, the Brandy Shoes. Yeah. Well, you're just going to be there. Well, we'll be all over town. So you'll find a location that's near you. And when the van is a close-by, you're going to pick one up. Alright. Okay. Thanks a lot, Kelly. Thanks a lot. Okay. Look at that foam. And these are the people that wanted no comedy bits are. What did to it is one line we're doing screamless even. I know it. That's Monday. It's Monday. It's all excuses. I saw for Ralph's phone is more than he might as well take an instrument and shorten the guy the M.B. To the stop-talking about that little baseball world series. Oh, that's right. If he would have talked more about the little league world series, then we'd have a lot of call. Call these sports assholes out. Oh, you're wrong, you're as better than the big-done. These kids really are put out. Yeah, that's probably what they're hoping is that those kids put out. That's because I can't imagine anybody else with a brain watching a bunch of nine and ten-year-old kids playing baseball on television unless they're bunch of pedophiles or something. Seriously, I mean, can you even begin to imagine it? No. 560560. What was that? Well, you give me an expression for it. Oh, it was not for you. What does that mean if they want to play the phone order they can call me out? I thought he didn't want to be involved with that. Because then they'll be calling him and saying, where the hell is it? You straight into that. I don't want to do that in mid-stream. That's what I said. That's the calm down. WQIM. Yep. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi, kind of colorally. Am I on taking something like that? Are you white? I'm not. I'm on a cure. So I'm on a cure. I'm on a cure. I'm on a cure. I'm on a cure. Okay, you're speaking to him. No. Yes, I'm not ignoring you. You're right there. I'm on the internet. Sounds just like you. Well, I just wanted to tell you, no welcome back. But what are we going to do about smoking the champ and the criminal object? He's got to go. Yeah. He's got to go. I'm really concerned. I just cannot believe it. I mean, what are these people taking their work into? Flash, lamb, bar. WQIM. Hello. Hi. What are you talking to? Speaking. Hey, you. Well, you're a way to take it home. Chronic. Chronic, man. Now, see, I'm not looking for chronics. We're not going to do the one routine like on Mo show this morning. I mean, if that's all we're going to get. We will go back to one of two the rest of the week. I thought it was a good idea. By the way, Book of Brian, come in here. Get your stuff and let's get going because I'm going to fly out of here in a few minutes. Don't be getting too goddamn comfortable. Let's cheer down there like you live here or something. Although, the way I'm hearing it. That could be in the future. Maybe it was Book of Brian, Russell, around in my attic this morning. Could have been. That could have been it. Well, what is all of this? What is that? What would you give me this for? The papers? No, I don't mean what. No, what is this? This isn't for me. This is for Clarence. Jesus Christ and Joseph and Mary, man. Give me invoices all kinds of crap. Anahedic. WQIM. Jesus Christ and Joseph and Mary, man. Give me invoices all kinds of crap. Anahedic. I looked at it better the first time. WQIM. No, what's happening? How you doing sir? All right, I'll let you. Okay. And? That's it. Oh, that was it? Okay, that was his material. WQIM. WQIM. Hello. No. Yes. How you doing? Pretty good. This is the highly touted one and two lots of calls are. Wonderful. Let me ask you a question. I saw you about a week ago and I'm just trying. You're driving a silver belt these days? No. What color is it? What happens is a makeup? I wasn't here a week ago. I'll get in. I wasn't. You get some more on coming. You're off. Any sort of waving in the mouth. I'm flagged on the guy. Who look like you? I said, could it be you? No. Let me ask you this. Would I have been waving on American flag? Well, you're an honorable citizen. I would think you would be probably. No, I would not. Maybe I'd waving a Canadian flag. But not an American flag. Wouldn't idiot. Let me just sign these papers here for a bulk of Brian. And who can't even spell my name or I wouldn't idiot. You're a moron. I'm signing this that I didn't even what I let says. Well, it's not going to look too good when the signature. You don't even. I don't care. Just wipe your ass with it. Okay. Stop bugging me. Won't think about me, man. I got to take here at a whole universe. I'm paying this one's car payment. I'm signing this one for his house. I'm everybody in the world, man. Just sucks the blood out of my poor little political body. That's me. That's my role in life. See if it was up to me. I mean, I never say this, but I'm going to say it right now. Very frankly, if it was up to me, I could just leave right now. Walk out to the door. Go home and pack a little bag. And that would be it. You never see me again. Never see me again. But I had a look for it in the three years and plus what is it now? September October and three and a 30 years more this. So I can continue sustaining the happiness of God damn universe. That's it. That's me. I said that just for his benefit because I know what a pussy he is. 560 70560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Can you do this for me? Can you do that? No, can't do it. Don't ever ask me anything again. Don't even dream of it. Don't ask me no favors. Okay. No more favors. No more. A crap. I took it out of there. Plus now he brings this stuff. And what am I going to do with this now? This point. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm getting out of here. You're going to have to do a few minutes. That was wrong with you man. I'm not only doing a one or two hour but I got to go to the doctor. I got to go pay for rumors doctor bill. Probably. There's got to be some method to his madness. You think I'm going to get my 14 bucks from that lottery ticket from my year? No. I mean, I'm going to tell you something seriously. I'm not exaggerating my tell you this. I know the Dutch are cheap. Remember my Dutch landlord? I was used to belly. I can't see how cheap he was. If I put 100 watt light bulb in there, he was belly. I can't see it. That's the best part. 100 watts. Oh my god. He was like Santa Claus compared to Rimmer. Santa Claus. Now wouldn't you feel since I'm letting venting all of this up? Wouldn't you feel if you helped somebody lose nearly a guy damn million dollars in the stock market? Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars. Wouldn't you feel guilty about it? Wouldn't you feel guilty to the extent that you wouldn't there? Expect that person to ever pick up a check at a meal for the rest of your life if you had any saying. You would grab that check so fast you practically rip everybody's hand off. Just from the guilt from the pains of guilt you'd have from the derand pangs of guilt. Over the fact that you helped this man in another three and a half years, I got to work. So I can not only sustain all of mankind, so I can finally retire someday and walk away from this guy damn smelly crappy microphone. It sounds like a goddamn aluminum tube. Maybe these aluminum tubes that Sodom was trying to buy. That must be it. They want up in this studio. Maybe George Corso bottom. He looks like a goddamn terrorist. Benny? I say fry his ass right now. Do it now and ask questions later. That's my suggestion for George Corso and this phony balloon engineering department. And you know that's now how it sounds totally different than five minutes ago. If you don't like the way we sound now, tune back in, check back what is later like these to see on us. You and we'll sound better. How's it now? How's that? Yeah, I mean like every couple minutes it's like a different radio station. Are you noticing any signal problems? I'm wondering where you listen to the card driving down here. What is it? What is it? It's the EBS thing. Right in the middle of the... It's the EBS thing, right in the middle of the... Who did the EBS thing? It happens automatically like in the bowels somewhere. The EBS, I guess it is. They did the EBS thing in the middle of... Oh, we like that? What kind of a communist bunch of crap is that? That's not supposed to happen like that. EBS, of course, look where we are, you know? They're making right down. While we ran it at a certain such a time, give us our license back. I'm not talking about the EBS. I'm asking you about the signal, the quality of the signal. Schmuck, Schmidhead was fun. It was good in the card. Oh, I got in the card this morning, man. After any acres, and I thought I was listening to the goddamn radio Moscow. I just... Like that. Maybe that was just most squeezing the bag. Might have been it. Horrible signal. And now, how much are you going to fill here? I don't want to leave you like hanging with too much time. Whatever, I'll fill whatever you feel. But every hand you have to fill, right? Are you sure? Yeah, I feel. Fill a few minutes. Oh, because I got to get out here and go get my pills. That's a lunatic.
