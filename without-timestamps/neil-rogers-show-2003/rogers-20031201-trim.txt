There's a button I just know. It's a kid's stop. A kid's stop. A kid's stop. Stink Michael Jackson is backing a traffic. He's constantly looking for anything for the graphic. Pictures and videos acting butils. Even some filthy away from the waves. Never land rents, wells like monkeys and llamas. Little boys wearing those trapdoor pajamas. Michael would see grippy watch when they pee. Then haul them up to the tempting tree. Teddy bears wearing tricolor by grazers. Under real peasant he's packed in the dumb waiters. They perish, come trust him, superman rings. Those are up to you, obviously pretty things. Michael Jackal, he's up when I go. He's no wings of jail. Will this wrong me right and will he be inclined to put his bearers well? No. I'm safe. Not a chance. 10 or 1 at 5.60. WQM happy Monday too. Okay, time to get back to serious, right? In the time to get back to the finish. Whatever, sure. No? Well, what in the hell do we ever do that? When we're going to get back to a serious back to a terra firma. January 2nd, 2004. So Hillary Clinton had her, uh, PR, uh, trip her photo op upstairs. Hillary went to a swller went over to Afghanistan and do I rack? And before she could make it to I rack there was, uh, W was there up staging her with her photo op of his own. And I love all these so-called pundits. Oh, and it was so sincere and he was so concerned for the troops. And he was showing above above above by right. Right. By the way, there's two more Americans dead since he left. I just mentioned that in passing through more Americans. They're more Americans. They're going to work. They were all based on lies, but nobody wants to talk about that. It's just, it's just mind-boggling. But I'm not going to get upset about it. Just like muck told me this morning the pay charge clear. It's like you need to know as the A.O. Here comes the money and there goes your money. That's like you need to know. This keeps showing away. Got to bad news though. Besides the three more Americans that died, and then of course, they seven spanards in the two. Who would the other two from where Japan? Ah. And of course, a whole bunch of a racky. The racky scum like that the facts we had last week. That was a crank facts. Yeah. Wouldn't it? Yes. Superstar that 1920s did. And you didn't even know who the hell this was. I can't prove you. You're slipping. Larg coded. Virtu.edrely. Who was the toast of American Europe in 1926. Don't you remember that? Oh yeah. Like it was just yesterday. Yesterday it seems. Uh, became the first woman to swim the English channel. Died Sunday at 97. She died. That's 20 old enough. Believe me, 97. I think 90's old enough. She died. What do you laugh about? You wouldn't like to make it to 90 and pre-decent. I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll take it right now. I could like sign a contract and have, you know, the gods of death or whatever the hell it is. Just say, okay, you can make it to 90. I would say, okay. What sounds reasonable. It's a good mission. She made it to 97.

Well, that's ridiculous. That's so silly. Some people might have to be able to appreciate my bloodesticker than water. And all of the, it's a polycrap. You know, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your relatives. You can't pick your aunts and uncles. You can't pick your nieces and effusier brothers and law. You're iron and laws. You can't pick any of those things. It's just crap happens. Well, some people might actually have a nice family. Yeah. All of them. No, not all those people. Well, there you go. So just because somebody's related to you doesn't mean okay, but they said 233 plus a was Thanksgiving weekend. My God. That's the time you're going to say crap like that. Even though you don't believe it. Love 154. Love is the most important thing in law. Oh man. To survive, now this one didn't belong in her in her first place because it kind of makes all the other ones Moot 125. That doesn't belong in her fourth. There's low expectation people. Oh. Money 102. Now we're starting to get a little bit warmer. That would be in a minor number three choice. Making a difference 75. What a politically correct bunch of assholes you had on this pool. Now what a bunch of schmucks. Oh, God. A good buzz 57. A good buzz buzz this. Sex 53. That would have a number two of course in my pool. Sex number two and money number three. Friends 32 and see why are family more friends? You choose your friends, your family just fall into it. Okay. Okay. She's so extreme. She's a freebies 19. I mean, this is the most dishonest pool in the history of how many of these we take and how many thousand. By third man. And this has got to be the most blatant act of dishonesty. The self-floor audiences ever come through with. It's almost the reverse order would be correct other than the good health. Everyone that lives were watching them. Freebies 19 and soft Florida. All right. I'm surprised freebies didn't beat out good health. Even if you'd like on your deathbed they would still take the freebies. Packs and sweet low in the sack. Putting my box. Pretty young with all the freebies. Gramey with a deal pickles. You bastards. Yeah. So this pool. I mean pretty good response considering. We got two polls for today. Now the first one. I know you're not going to be interested. But the beast kind of like got me excited about this on Thursday. Well, be talking to me to have said it. If it part about his performances, he shut up. He didn't say too much and then noon to one on Thursday. We played bits here. So he or whenever it hell was 11 a noon. Here's our first pool. I know you're going to get this one wrong too. But we'll have some some names probably called him for this or not. Who do you think was the exciting athlete ever to play for a soft Florida team? I've only got four choices here so far. I don't care about sports. It's always got to be on there because we have a lot of people to the audience who are just like George. Well, almost. They don't. They just don't give a flying crap about sports. And let me give you a little advice. I'm going to give you two pieces of advice today. Number one, don't ever go to Montreal. I'll explain why momentarily. And number two, sports as you become older becomes much less important. They're just games. You know, no. The Patriots, the Patriots, great goal line stand there. The nice going Tommy Bull. Patriots and Bill Bullachock, man. They're unbeatable. Take the dolphins pull one out of their ass on Thursday. Just coming out of nowhere and crushing the overrated Cowboys. That was amazing. Do you pay the end of course the least one or fifth and row last night? So what's not to like, right? But it's not as important as it used to be. As you get older you realize that some of those other things under your list are a little bit more important than ball games. Except the course of QAIM or we have a lot of neurotic joclickers. Anyway, who do you think was the most exciting athlete ever to play for some photo team? I don't care about sports. Pavel Bore, Dan, Marino, or J. Fieler. Now the reason I had to J. Fieler. Because after that came on because there's so many phony's out there. It's not a photo that you'll get some votes. You'll see. Now pull number two which I really give them both at the same time which will start around noon. But I'm going to give it out to you now. In what city in the world do the highest percentage of very ugly people live? I don't think I worded that well. That's okay. That's fine. In what city in the world do the highest percentage of very ugly people live? Not you all. That's very hard to bat a thousand. The bat 100%. But in Montreal they've been 100%. There are nothing but ugly people. Which I felt pretty much at home there myself. In fact, when I arrived, they said, oh, you're perfect for Montreal. Now, seriously. Because everybody, though, the young people are ugly. The teenagers are ugly. The young adults are ugly. The middle age people are ugly. The old people are ugly. Even little children and babies are ugly. In Montreal. Interesting city. But selling point then. Is it? Well, if you're ugly, then you can go there and get late. With another ugly person. Right. I'll pass on that. Montreal and I put Paris on there too because there's a lot of frogs. Oh, always said the only thing wrong with France is the French people. And the only thing Montréal is the people are all gross. I mean, not just regular ugly. Like, you know, it can't like not in the script. But I mean extraordinarily ugly. There's something like a defect genetic defect, their French. So that'll be the second pull for later on. Got that big black eye again. And I can't understand why it's so hard for me to find a story. Head of go to the Cincinnati post to get the details. And this now CNN has shown it a hundred times already. Maybe not a hundred. About the big black eye that got roughed up by the cops. And of course he died. Three separate investigations have been launched into Cincinnati's first death. And police custody since 2000 raising questions about the use of force that provides a troubling backdrop to Cincinnati's scoring in ceremonies for their new city council today. Not good timing. They're investigating the early Sunday morning death of Nathaniel Jones 41. No address available after a struggle of police outside a white castle restaurant in Avon, Dale O'Hile. Maybe that's not the place I don't want to go. No. How much of the people are even ugly with the people in Montréal? I'm sure. There are menics who responded as to 554 AM for police to be dispatched to the scene near the white castle. Saying the man was very much awake. He wasn't passed out on like the reports and becoming a nuisance to the people there. At 6 AM, they asked for a mental health response team to attend to take care of this disorderly subject run. And a minute later, somebody with a taser. But police say the brawl with Jones was already on and all the MHRT official Michael Schulti about this minutes later. It was already too late to avoid a physical confrontation. Per standard practice six police officers involved in Jones arrest of in place on paid administrative leave as the investigation continues. There were forced to subdue him with batons and a chemical irritant because Jones whom police estimated at 5 foot 6 and nearly 400 pounds. The 5 foot 6 nearly 4 to pounds were slugging officers in the federal bay orders to put his hands behind his back to be handcuffed. And arrested for disorderly conduct he was pronounced DAD shortly after being taken to the University Hospital in Cincinnati. It changed to Rodney Jones all over again all a little bit darker than Rodney or King. That's Rodney Jones. Well, don't make one difference because they're both dead interchangeable. All the Rodney King at least wasn't that fat, you know. Can you imagine five six and 400 pounds? What we've seen him we've seen the tape 100 times on TV. Just a tub of tub of trouble. And then of course his brother placed at a man goes, Baba trouble. 1013 at 560 Imagine this. Imagine envisioning Todd REC under a gigantic Mac truck bleeding to death. No not that.

Okay. Who do you think was the most exciting athlete ever to play for a soft load of team? I don't care about sports. Pavel Brey, Dan Marine or J. Fieler. They're going to get this one wrong. There's got to be some other names. Be suggested. Of course he had some hooray cool names on it. But I don't want to put him on myself. We'll be back up to the audience. Okay. Don't answer the phone. Whatever you do, Josh. Because I'm having so much fun already. Well, least, I'll let you tell these other bedtime stories. Okay. Okay. I just am nauseated and revolted by the way. The media reacts to everything. You know, they put together this ridiculous. Oh, we're going to surprise the media. We're going to pull a shock and a presence. Going to show up there for like, you know, a couple of hours. And then by the time they announced it to the world, he's already going to be high tail in the back to, to the US. Oh, and it was heartfelt and it was a show of concern for the troops. They don't belong there in the first place for crying out loud. But we're not supposed to say those things. Hey, don't forget it was brave that he didn't even leave the airport. Right. That's right. And how about that British airways pilot that actually saw Air Force One? And said, did I really see that? No, no, you didn't see that. Okay. But I thought I saw WQAM. WC pilot, that off? Yes, sir. Did I know? Yes. Yes. Is it there? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You're leaving.

A long, though morning. A long, though morning. Wither without the kidney. Okay. Thank you, sir. It's a pretty weak choice. But we'll put him in there. A long, though morning. I don't think there are that many good choices. Right? I think we're in Marina or the, uh, that'll be it. How about Bob Greasy was he your signing? Yes, sir. Terminal? How about Brian Greasy? Yes, sir. And incompetent. Oh, look at his, now you got copy that your facts in me here now that the show isn't a middle. You know, fat boy, you're just an accident waiting to happen. You tub a crap.

Yeah, then what a shot that that the sparks are just called again making the whole song and then it's about a two racial thing again. He was making a joke. I think or try. No, he was, no, he was not making a joke. That's the same guy that calls all the time. What do you mean he's making a joke? Well, I think this time he was trying to be funny with the white castle angle. No. W to Q, I am, uh, line nine. Joe's a guy. The zaster line, yeah. Oh, Joe's a guy. Oh, Joe's a guy. He's a guy. He's a guy. He's a guy. W to Q, I am, hello. Joe's a guy. He's a guy. Yeah, okay. Paul Worfield. Paul Worfield was great. Number 42. See, I'm about to call a guy. What?

Because I've got the right answer on this one. But, uh, yeah. Oh, let's see. Dan Reno 16. Oh, there. Oh, man. I'm not going to say anything. This poll is going to be even more cocky than when you took on a Friday. Cocky. WDQAM. Jim Mandage. Jim Mandage. Jim Mandage. Jim Mandage is a choice. Yeah, right. And we're going to put him on there. No, don't put him on. There is a tight end. Is a tight end exciting? No. No. They're really struggling. I beg to differ. A tight end can be very excited. Right. But not the end you got in mind. And we're not talking about lunch. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Variety and Variety and Variety and Variety and Variety and Variety and Variety. Right. Disney by the way. Raw. He's from Disney aboard. He's the scapegoat for now. But he says he wants to take 70 with him. He not only resigned today. But he also says he wants to take 80 with him. Because he said he's a disaster and mitigated disaster. He said his leadership over the past seven years. He wouldn't wish on Hitler or something like that. Disney. If you have company co-founder Walt Disney, not immediately. We turn calls yesterday. We can imagine why. But he did say that he wants. I know. Disney and his closest board associate standly. Golden among Eisner's most vocal critics. As the company stock prices declined, ratings of fallen into ABC TV network. Got ya. Got ya.

I thought we're gonna have a disaster day. Q. A. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Yeah. I'd like to respond to the poll. Go right ahead. Okay. How about Jeff Konaing? Jeff Konaing is exciting? Well, he's the only thing we got in the as far as baseball goes down here. Yeah. Right. Good night to both of Florida. I mean, that's why nobody goes to the games during regular season. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. Jeff Konaing's exciting. I would have thought it done trailway. We've been exciting, right? Huh? Don trailwillis. Hey, you better get with it, Mr. Didn't I just tell you a minute ago, the older you get the more important these ball games become. Oh, I hit the other way around. That's true. As you become a little bit older. Go let me forget to do a couple hours on Montreal. All the ugly. It's an interesting city. It's a really interesting. It's very European. And it got 80 million like, you know, sex shops and, uh, Dull those and stuff like that. But the problem is that there's nobody there. You want to have sex with in the first place. Unless you're really into very, very ugly people like me. I felt beautiful there. For the first time in my life, I felt man. I'm a hot number. It was like old men running around chasing me up and down. Same Katherine, speak grab in my hands. Get out of here. I was standing them off with my umbrella. I'm serious, man. I've never ever seen a place. What are they? And they have this underground network of, uh, stores and shops of like walkways under underground city. 18 miles of it, 30 kilometers. And it's really neat. Of course the only problem was it took like a couple of days to figure that thing out. While the meantime the snow is blowing and wind and just unbelievably nasty. So there was a lot of blowing going up and not the kind of I had in mind. It was just a horrible place. It's nice to see. You might want to go see it sometimes. Maybe for like a couple of hours. And you look around and you say, God, then, you know what was right? I mean, I'm not saying to go someplace. Everybody's got a beautiful. We can't all look lovely like, you know, like, moe, for example. That's a good thing. By the way, mom, glad you're getting your beauty sleep this morning. After having had tucked performance last night, made a bad mistake. We have that on. I don't want to play it. But he just keeps making more and more mistakes than almost as you get into your 80s.

That's the moment for you. And the worst part of it is we carry that game right here on QM last night. Jacksonville and Tampa. Yeah. With the moment. So we had to have another morning beauty rest off today because he had a ball game for Jones network last night. Nice going moe, you tub a crap. 1027 at 560 WQM. It's that time of year again.

How are David did not do the game last night, Jacksonville and Tampa on a radio. He did the Viking Rams game. I want to clock. I guess this may make much difference where the game was, whether it was in Minnesota or in San Luis. That was a one-to-clock game, which means the game was over by four, four, fifteen at the latest. And he couldn't get back to the show this morning. No, it's what they're telling us. Right. Because that's part of his deal now when he does these extra curricular activities. Yes, that's some time off. The refill is bag is what I'm hearing. You don't understand? Absolutely. Right. So that's probably a service to the South Florida audience, the fact that you've... But you're getting all this bad information about he did the game last night, which I would understand that. Even you could understand that. Sure. He needs his beauty rest all over it hasn't kicked in yet. In fact, I think he'd be perfect in much your own. Maybe he and I will alope. Here's the fact that says the most exciting Florida athlete was Larry Zonko. When he got to ball, it was an amazing display of running as he sacrifices body for the team on like anyone ever to wear dolphin uniform. He literally carried the 72 dolphins to the perfect season by getting a possible third and long and first down, punishing opposing defenses to the floor where they were reluctant to even try to tackle him by the fourth quarter. He paid for this with a very short career now is almost crippled as a result of his sacrifice. Doesn't it make you want to like have a tear while up in the corner of your eye? Already has. It says for all the marino sniffers out there, it's very appropriate that Dan has a statue, even though he never brought home a championship. At the end of marino square, he looked like a statue standing in the pocket. If Dan gets a statue, Zonko should get a shrine, but don't confuse the 80-90 fans with a truth. Personally, I thought Larry Zonko was boring watching him. I mean, you know, he ran like an old lady with a leg time to get it. He was very difficult to bring down and got a lot of yardage out of all these things, but you see, they don't understand the question again. They don't get it. They don't get it. And maybe he does get it, but I just disagree wholeheartedly. The idea of watching Larry Zonko run like an old lady was just, it's just, I don't know if, if somebody was to say Jim Brown and Cleveland, anybody could agree with that. Even George would agree with that, especially when he was beating up his wife. Oh yeah, that's exciting. Right, that's what she said. Who do you think was the most exciting athlete ever to play for South Florida team? This is not a difficult question in terms of understanding what it means. You get it in an opinion. So we put Larry Zonko on there. Oh sure. You got a spell right there. I'm sure. I don't care about sport. Well, let me read the result. Dan Marino 49. I don't care about sports 14. Palvel Bre, which clearly is the correct answer by a mile, has got only eight votes. Eight votes. And now he's got 10. Let's see, Marino 51. I don't care about sports 17. Bre 10. Paul Warfield 4. Jay Fieler's got three. Oh, which I mean, it's just enough to make me want to scream. Like that. The much maligned and abused and despised and reviled and hated Jay Fieler up until tight, skipping day, he's got three. Or actually up until that, when he came into fourth quarter, they a previous game. The red skin game. A lot of the morning's got a pair. Only one don't work. And Larry Zonko just went on there out of 87 votes. Jay Fieler's got three votes. Oh, and I guess we don't have to hurt him fans either because we don't have to hurt whom players been called in yet. The V suggested on Thursday Michael Irvin for this list. Are we going to put him on there? No. And that's just ridiculous. That's silly. That's just downright silly. 560, 560, pound 560 on a AT&T. I will say one great thing for Montreal. He said the fact that it's very European. Yeah. And it's got a lot of, I'm telling you, though, shopping area is the underground area is very, very upscale beautiful. A lot of roller skate. But boy, they have a lot of great restaurants. Man, oh man, all we did was eat and eat. You're a bunch of munger for three days. Are you allowed to skate? Were there any skaters in there? Nothing. I say. And guess what? You're not going to believe this. Let me give you a little clue. Guess who was in Montreal the same time that I wasn't in any realises. Speaking of going to dinner, who I could have bought in his guess where the Panthers played Saturday night. Oh no. Really? Guess where the Florida Panthers came Victor Coslov's score late? I'm on a hurry. Do be as penalty call against Montreal, but nevertheless Panthers tied it up out of one one time. If it's free, it's me. There you go. There are women and a Panthers were there and they were realising. I could have taken remember to dinner, for example, at the Volca Chinos? Tremendous restaurant. Or at Rubens for some real good deli. Not that airzots make believe. Place you took me here in Toronto a month ago, Rimmer. A really good place called Rubens. Sounds Jewish to me. And then there's a chain of restaurants called the Betham Rouge. Do we have that in South Florida? We have Betham Rouge. Don't know. Oh, the man, good stakes and great just a really fabulous place. It was fabulous. But I forgot all about it until it was probably too late. Sorry, Rimmer. I'd have called you for sure. How to track you down. Wouldn't I? For free meal. No. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10. And speaking of free meals tomorrow, I got a banner day in my life. I don't know how I should view this whole thing. But with you are evening, I'm taking to Ruth Chris, my favorite steak house in a rob Take it with Chris, a couple of my high school friends. I haven't seen over 40 years. Yeah, you're predicting I'm going to be depressed. No, I'll just pull in your leg. No, you were not. It'll be a fine nostal. But I've already sent me. They've already emailed their pictures. They know what I look like. I mean, we realize there were old farts. Now I haven't seen these. Then they have good people. Good kids. Kristen, not kids no more. You'll have a great time. Yeah, we will. No matter if they're cutting your sarcasm. Okay. We'll have a good time. But we'll sit there looking at each other and think, oh my god, are we old? You know, 61, 61 and old when you're in some affordable. And you're here. It's like pretty old. Now I understand why all the French Canadians have come down to some affordable. Everybody's always bitching about them with the speedos. How fat and disgusting they are. It's because first of all, they're disgusting when they're born. So they can't help that part of the fat part because they got all that good food there. But also they're going to do. They're just going to go underground. They're going to go from one food court and another one to a. I'm telling you, when there's endless food, they even have like Laura C. Court, I scream there. You ever have that? No. Hmm. I did. Well, I wanted to. But I did. 1041, 19, before 11. Oh, speaking a great food, but a nice segue, Neil.

else in a state of Florida and what have you got like that it's mug one bill and you wonder I mean something is simple you guess what they have in Montreal big casino gambling casino huh and as soon as I started reading about that you know when you're in a hotel it's 100 below zero on a windows blown outside you're definitely not going anywhere soon and you're reading a little booklets about tourist attractions and see this and here's the casino and I'm thinking you know soft floor of the whole state of Florida is held back by a bunch of the end of thumb mugs I mean something is basic is that you got the lotterrain all your horses in the dog racing and pyline and all of this other crap but oh my god we sure is how wouldn't want to have casinos don't forget to lose cruises and we got

they didn't leave me for a second like I said except for the cranks actually was alright surprising WQA and hello hello yes sir and what's going on let me ask your question is for a record and I'm 40 because you know they're morning sure wasn't on this morning yeah you have any idea about that not that I know of not that you know of the consumer they had like he is being ready to something like something they never have a real good guys were not on which I found strange so I thought maybe for I was going over there something uh... if we have found out you'll be the first to know and you think about Marty's truck you said it elegans I knew have a great day there's a hockey fan somebody knows Marty's trucker from Marty shorts which is very unusual and so forth I know I realize that my fellow panther people out there could say how could you say those things if we lost our hockey you know like most is you don't want to live to see that doesn't have professional baseball you know right I don't see stupid crap like that is he just stupid I must have said that a hundred times you don't want to live at a city to break the news to you know many of us live in south Florida use that in past tense in my case many of us live in south Florida long before to ready marlins and world series and all two of them now life was a lot better than it is now and not having anything to do with baseball but it just was life in south Florida was much much much better and you know what the reason was much better what no more absolutely I mean if we had to have a trade off if we if we could have to lose the marlins but we had to lose most part of the package what would we say they be lined up fifty miles deep make that place in orange city that Walmart Pailin with significance they be lined up fifty thousand deep a bit of QAM yeah calling for filling up in uh writing is second vote of least people in the world okay where is writing where's that's a need of silly you got fifth verse in the middle of the house the middle of the state for a family Alabama yep you mean like in uh Harrisburg yeah it's right in the house for a big out of it drive from hours and jerks to get the writing where he's out of the house the other people in the world you know your own den you're out you see other people you never know some you only know the good looking people you walk in this place

that dot of it with nab same reason as they build up Steve McNay and all those other dark quarterbacks right right right you asshole god and you notice the Eagles that have lost the game since he opened up that big mouth I do believe I could be wrong about that but I don't think so I think they haven't lost the game since rush open up his big mouth and once he opened up his big mouth he heard pop and oxies in there and they've got a real tourist so that's the rumor is that uh... for all is going to be doing mornings on a nine forty you think whatever okay well we need to find out how come you don't have any inside sources you know and then the inside source we do have like fat boy he gives you bogey information about how mode did the game on uh... Jones radio last night guess what that follow crap follow three hundred seventy five pounds of big oozing crap he did the minnesota saying was rams game yesterday in say Lewis on uh... that whatever hell at bogus network is and still could make it back in time to be on this morning but i've got a different attitude about that fact i think there's a lot of people in the audience alike to seem to a lot more ball games and miss a lot more mornings you know i'm saying it out absolutely that's a thought that's an idea we could just make up ball games every day right that's what muff said and what city in the world of the highest percentage of very very ugly grotesque people the top of fifty nine montreal forty one you can't complain about the good looking people in montreal because there are many cleavent thirty eight peristirty four Hollywood florida thirty two highly a twenty three asco seventeen national thirteen o call seven reading p a six and bartha lona has got a big pair by by by by
