It's a little bit ponderous. There's a lot of pressure on your audience. Alongshore probably gets some additions. But do you see anybody that I left out that immediately pops in your mind? No, but I'm busy looking for somebody that I can vote for. Because there aren't the just aren't that many radio personalities. Let anywhere in any market. Not just hours. Other than Neil, what radio personality do you listen to most? Most. They were all my parents during. Paul and Ron. Mohour Davidad. Jim Mandage. Fully. Rikshah. Randy Rhodes. Steve Kane. Rush Limboh. Dr. Laura. Thank Goldberg. Shit. It would have been an audio and mark. Do I leave somebody out? No, I think that's it. I mean I could put people on there like this. He's on music stations, but that's I don't know. Like Johnny Dark? Who used to be? Huh? We don't even know any Dysja. I mean like Fully, he's a personality. Right? What about Tom Joyner? Is he still doing it the Fly Duck? Tom Joyner was on passions by the way for a couple days doing a cameo. Really? Yeah, and I'm sorry. And you still haven't seen Sheridan yet? No, you're lost.

I have the way to who is, but if it's good enough for everybody else's commitment. So we got we're adding Tom Joyner and Albe Silk. And who's the main job on EDR? Is got to be somebody. You know nobody's Carlos? Huh? Yeah, he's a big listener to EDR. Oh, I'm sure he is. He's hip hoppin' it all the way to the banquet at Big Patriarch. Is you kidding me? My hand. He's hip hoppin' it. I'll think I can get it. I'm sure that. Not under the overpass. In other words, EDR don't come in on sure wave. 560560. 560 on the AT and Verizon. Whatever it is. Look at that. There are ahead of us. But they don't mess around. Eric sneaked the second pool in there. Oh, well, I'm afraid the only one for today. But the replacement for yesterdays. And they're right on it already. Other than Neil, what radio personality listen to most, you managed his six. Oh, right. Howard's sperm has two hanks. Got a pair. Mohawk, David, it's got one. Hey. Mohawk, David, you got one vote already on the pole bay. Wait. Paul and young Ron have one and Randy Rhodes has one. Pretty big one from what I hear. And Joe and Mark have one.

You're by our way. Stick it to me from George. Yeah, George is rubbing off from George. Big lip bandit. Now, get these to Eric right away. So we don't have to make that same mistake we did yesterday. Where was that long pause? Because Eric was a puke in his guts out. He was at the pole all day or something. I notice he's right on top of things today. Because he is mommy, bitch and him out again on a year. Which I will if he, uh, dilly dally's at all in the very least. I'll rip him an ass. And in his case, that would be quite an undertaking. Okay, let's get somebody's great calls on here today. Got a lot of stuff. We got Elizabeth his home. She's safe. I have some concerns about what went on there because this guy that kidnapped her this religious nut. There we go with that being redundant again. Religious nut. Uh, he, uh, snatched Elizabeth to make her his second wife and a polygamous relationship. Ryan David Mitchell, aka manual, was one of these smartiest nastiest. And of course, since he had her under his spell, uh, for nine long months, one can only assume the worth to their own sand. Yeah, not, not a pretty picture. At least she's home and safe. Oh, that's good. That's a good start. Did you know she was home and safe? Who? You did who is, is who home and safe? Elizabeth smart is home and safe. Elizabeth smart is home and safe. Yeah, and that's something. Again, I'm not trying to make light of it, but you people at the media are crazy. You're crazy over here. Here's my any, hello. Welcome home Elizabeth. Yeah. Hey, Neil. She's home and safe. Aren't you happy? I'm thrilled. You don't sound too sweet. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Um, I don't know if you got a, you know what? Yeah. Shut up, no. I don't know if you got a little bit. No, shut up. Listen. No, my, come on, they're like, get that damn swallowing your head. Ryan. So I don't know if you got a listen to, um, the Humpheter yesterday. Uh, huh, why did not hear the Humper? Look, oh, I got it. I got one comment. Hey, hang stick to the sports buddy. You suck. What was he talking about? Click. Oh, click. Well, he hung up on him. No, as a matter of fact, no, you know, I did hear Hank talking about the war or something. We're just a second. I wasn't here checking something on the internet. And you can tell me, do that. I just potted up to see what's going on. And I, but I only heard like 30 seconds. So I, and he was talking about a rack in this. And I don't know. So there you go. 926 at 560WQM. Let me tell you about a place we can all go in fees. Maybe we'll have the last supper there. What do you think, huh? OK. I'll fly down special for that. We'll just go there and pick out a lead until we all croak. But will the big smile on our face at the Emerald Coast Chinese buffet? You'll find what in sunrise, North Miami, Beach, and at newest location in Pembroke Pines, they've got six different kinds of soups. And you can ladle in your bowl all you like. One or two or all six, if you like. And they've got dozens of succulent antres, not just Oriental stuff, but all kinds of fresh veggies and all kinds of other good things too.

Pies and cakes and pastries, ice cream, all your favorite toppings, fresh fruit, a gigantic feast at the Emerald Coast buffet. Three locations like I said only moments ago, you'll find the new original soft photo location in sunrise at Pine Island of 44th Street. They're on Collins Avenue just north of 160 to the other north Miami Beach and we'll remember how great North Miami Beach used to be. And at the intersection of Flamingo and Peverc roads in Pembroke Pies, they've set reservations, take out and live here also available and look for the new Oriental chicken salad when you hop into the Emerald Coast column at 9.54, 5.72.3822. 9.54.57.3822. Be sure and tell Richard that Neil sent you by the Emerald Coast and he'll say, go, Lee Skull. There's no derives. Warning, we have mercilessly taken the following material out of context without endorsement or permission for most depicted. It is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent look as ridiculous as possible. We hope we reach that goal. Former President of Bill Clinton, your wife, the genius owner from New York, his bitch. I think that's a no-brighter. He's a pig at the trough. Couple other things. The Chelsea done a job. Some men it was reported in the cave. No, no. She's been pushing. Good. I'm very glad. All right. Let's discuss something close to us. Uh, as. Oh, sure. You know, as you might imagine, I have a young assistant, you're sticking her. Yeah, and an occult myth done. Not a ready. I did. I cut through there like a hot night through butter. Oh, okay. Thank you. We'll be right back with former President. Thank you. Uh-huh. I'm 32 at five, 60, WQAM. So anyway, I noticed that for some strange reason, Tom Jr. and Alby silk. They haven't made the list yet. Big lip-banded designer. But how come they didn't make it? Carlos. He said it. I see. Are we going to get back at that again? I'm sure that Eric is working on it right now. A nice big, ham sandwich. Maybe a little bit of cheese. Lacy Peters and how long do you think it would take before we got her name back at the thing end? About two minutes. In other, do go back at that again. Where's Lacy Peters? And now that we finally found Elizabeth Smart. Kind of figures don't it? 80 votes so far on a poll. And you know, this is going to change at 10 o'clock. You do know that, don't you? No. I'm telling you right now, the percentages will change dramatically because Howard sperm is still on now. And Ron and Paul are still on. And so once people tune over back to watch at 10, 10, 30, whenever they get around to it, because Howard sperm is on, when how does he go up? When he feels like it? I'm going to start doing that. What's left today by 11.15? OK. But anyway, other than Neil, what radio personality you listen to most? Jim Manage 23. All right. Howard sperm 15. Randy Rhodes 11. Wow. Oh my god. Now that's, can you believe that? That's a partial crowd. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Peter. God Almighty, Randy Rhodes 11. Hey, Goldberg 11. Paul and young Ron and the old Paul and the five on Zeta. Rush Limbaugh 4. Only 4 for the fat one. Mohara David has got four. He's tied with Rush. How do you like that? Moh, you're moving up in a world maybe your tie with Rush. And Dr. Laura Schmidt and Joe and Mark Hichey have two 80 keys. Got one in none for anybody else. Yeah, I don't, I don't see it. I'll be silk or time join around there. They're working on it. And they're working on it all right. She were off the set. She could start to accept the technical sabotage we had. Thank God, Julio's in the building. You get that all straight now. You know what? And he got a lot of stuff. Huh? I've got a lot faster now. Yeah, he can. Like a speeding bullet. I scored Holy On. Linda Kornakhova's, uh, Wozri, uh, who? I was revenge again. Linda to rock. She's violent. 10 is Vitsson and Akorna Kovaz and Danger of losing millions and endorsements after ex-husband and hockey star Sergei Fedorab. By the way, speaking of hockey, the Panthers never going to score another goal at home. No. Two home games, two for nothing shutouts. And the paper I looked at my paper this morning and the box to see how many people it said were their last night. 15,448. It said, I'm going to tell you something. Seriously, you people in the organization. You think you're kidding anybody? Cause I watched the TSN Montreal telecast last night cause they have pantered. They blacked out. And they actually backed up, you know, they paned the whole arena. They said they're going to have to start getting some people in this place. They're really desperate. They're couldn't have been 4,000 people. They're I've never ever seen anything like that. There was no bloody dare. Nobody. And a paper puts 15,000 like their fool in somebody. I guess they must have encountered everybody with the sawgrass too, huh? 10 is fiction and a corna hole is endangered. Losing millions and endorsements after S has been in hockey star surgery fedrawer veal their secret union last week says that European newspaper report. According to a slow-back daily, corna covas promising revenge after fedrawer off a place where you'd throw it red rings admitted that the couple had a brief marriage that ended in divorce. In the March 10th edition of Nobby Cause, corna cova who's in active hour re-evolutating ankle injury is quoted to saying that silver lucrative contracts for photo sessions could be lost thanks to federal office comments. Sergei did not have a right to do that. She said we agree that everything would remain our secret, our marriage as well as the matter of our divorce. She said this revelation made to pride me of some contracts. There's a clause in them that I must not become attached to any man. You think it says anything about attached to it? Any woman that would only help. Under the headline, corna cova promising revenge, the paper reports that fedrawer off's admission has severely complicated. The Russian tennis players like and that some of the US $10 million worth of corna cova's contracts are now in jeopardy. Yesterday, federal office agent said he was unaware of any secrecy agreement between his plan corna cova. Pat Grisson said he was present when federal office admitted to their marriage but didn't know what compelled the Russian center to make the information public. I have a feeling I know what compelled her to make it public, don't you? Why? That's the public. Christ, don't tell you. I think that's what did it. These are beautiful girl I know with an interesting topic, but I don't know why he did it. He said I don't think it was going to be all that important. After years of silence on his relationship with corna cova, the federal office revealed to the hockey news in its March 14 edition, we were married albeit brief and we are now divorced I don't keep in touch with her. I'm not touching her. And probably didn't before either. And a recent follow up in a view federal office that he was sort of protecting his form of wife and keeping her marriage a secret for so long. Well there you go. She's pissed off and fired out. How do you like that? And the pants has been scoring to an empty net at home. Maybe they should just play all the games on the road. Nobody shows up at home anyway. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T. You know Elizabeth Smart is home? Who? Who? Blame. Anger. Elizabeth's home. They've got relatives, neighbors, people that once wrote on the bus with her. School mates. Here's Tamara. Hello. Yes, sir. I'm not sure if you were aware of this, but Elizabeth Smart has been found and returned to her family. No. Seriously. Thank you. Thanks for the great news. Oh, right here. That. What? Other than Neil, what radio personality, listen to most demanded 27 Howard Stern 19, Randy Rhodes 16, which I'm really dubious of that. Wow. Hank Goldberg for 14. Paul in young Ron seven. It's interesting. And it's fascinating that these people listen good sign. The Howard sperm and the Iran and Paul people are voting so far 26. And this is like in a middle of those shows, which means they listen until you come on. There you go. That's a good start. And there's just speaking of start rhymes with start. There's Elizabeth Smart. Oh, yeah. She's home. There's that amateur out of on a harp on it. But there's that video again where she's playing at harp. She's cute as a button. You know, she's really a cute little girl. And I'm very happy that she's safe. I still have a little bit worried about that one thing, no, which thing would that be? Well, because it says that she had a little time's quote sources in Utah saying that Brian David Mitchell, aka, Emmanuel, the scumbag, snatched Elizabeth to make her his second wife and a polygamous relationship. The newspaper also reports it was during the five hours that Mitchell worked at the smart family home last year that he allegedly got the idea that God told him that Elizabeth was supposed to be his wife. Police sources say Elizabeth had been living in San Di Utah about only 20 miles from her family's home with Mitchell and at least one woman. The woman is believed to be one to varsity. The L.F. female companion to rest to Mitchell as Elizabeth was rescued as they have to. So in other words, if he got told him that she was going to be a second wife and I'd say a very grotesque thought, you know, yeah, we just hope she's fine and she's okay and she looks fine. But I have a feeling something happened that didn't meet the eye. Nomsin and this guy of course, they should execute them both on national TV. MSNBC, Fox, CNN, who might believe it out. CBS, NBC, ABC, TVC, P.W.P. UPN. Telebondol. People's yellow on TNT. TNT. Oh, he had this video one. Lifetime. There was the other one beside Telebondol. Moon dose. Oh, well. Univision. Univision. Oh, there you go. Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon. Sysomokestus. So all little kids should see this. What happens to if you do something like this, go test an average. Another religious nut. Another religious wacko with that beard and a whole thing look like a real scumbag. And you're right, scumbag. These scumbags were tired of scumbags. You know, they don't have to be like a bunch of militant Muslims scumbags. Those are pretty scary enough. But these scumbags were tired of them too. It just had to scumbags, you know. Right. One thing if you want to walk around looking like a scumbag. That's okay, but just don't act like a scumbag. That's all we ask. Is that too much? No. Cut it out. And see what happens when you give money to a scumbag. That's right. And that's the point. You know, we were discussing this before the show today. And the only reason that the homeless voice thing is growing like it's like some kind of disease. It's spreading like a virus is because some of you assholes out there are giving them money. Mm-hmm. Okay. And that's why we got 75 million scumbags all over South Florida on every street corner with their orange t-shirts doing this scam for Sean Cononi. It's a disgrace. Don't feed the monster. Don't feed the scumbags. Okay. Don't feed this cult is insanity because all you do by it is you're perpetuated. And you make it continue growing. It's like feeding a virus. They're all listening to me, you know. I wouldn't have that. So maybe. Yeah, if they were like bleeding on the street corner, I'd probably be ketchup. I wouldn't give them a dime. Spare some change, Mr. No. No way. 941. I get little worked up. I think I'm turning the corner now. I have to get all those votes in the death poll. I think I'm starting like a good energy man. It's kind of scary. I'm going to run. It's a little scary. Although, it won't beat me up like two to one. Just beat me by a million miles. So that's why I'm opening it. And by the way, his billboard, I understand, has no picture on it. So they were he and I are back to back. I've been on the turnpike at the 595 interchange. Visible going south on the turnpike and the south benefit is the turnpike from 595. There's an eel god billboard with my push on it. And turnpike, each side visible going south is north of Sterling Road. There's more Howard David it. So we're like all this back to back. Me and my good buddy to Mowmeister.

I feel really embarrassed and humiliated and stupid right now. You know, was that? Well, this fact you just sent me. How do I have left off, Phil? Are you sure? Huh? Kind of outside out of mind kind of things. I really am in the car at that time. Of course, here I'm not in the car at all.

I live in Texas and listen to you guys back on the web. He says, I like the good old days. Isn't it a misnomer to have Mo, oh, I see. Listen, you guys back to back on the web. He says, me and Phil. Isn't it a misnomer to have Mo on your list after all the questions, which radio personality and Mo has no personality? When I hear a match, I miss the worst team. It says, I love the show, but I don't miss out. Well, thank you so much for reminding me. And how come I took this guy from Texas to find us to put Phil Henry on there in his audience again, is like that, huh? What is wrong with these people? There's something very, very wrong. There is it in the air again? What's going on? I haven't been part of this now because Elizabeth Smart is home safe. How do you like that? Who? What's your name? No. Here's our only lonely call. It's from home state. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir. Hey, you also forgot Jim Rome. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. There's a home entouching guy from home state already. How do you like that? Happy home. Exactly. Look at that phone man. There's something really deadly going on. You had a whole bunch lined up now. Something must have happened. I'm not a wearer, but they just got tired and hung up. What's that supposed to mean? I guess I sound too happy today. That's because the pressure on my head is starting to alleviate now. Good. I do want to thank the Awaken Clinic where it is. Oh, then I haven't experienced trying to get my platyx as you well know. Yeah. But wait, are coming to get your hands. But the good news is I finally went because they I told you the other day. Anybody that comes up here. You better check. Make sure you got plenty of your prescription drugs when you get here. They won't mess with them, but you can't use a US prescription here. They won't let you call it in or in or in or whatever. So it's kind of like a little bit of blackmail. They make you go to a walk in clinic and you see a doctor went to the first walk in clinic downtown and were like 80,000 people in there. And she said, oh, it's a four to six hour wait. And so I registered and I signed on a thing and he said, you can go back home and come back in about four hours. So I come home way to come to ours. I colored to see how many more thousand people are online to like, oh, back just to get see the doctor get my prescription written. And she said, oh, basically, forget about it. But you can call this place. And so she gave me the phone number and address of another joint. I took a cab over there and I'm much more upscale beautiful place. There was about 10 people sitting in there. They got three doctors going. It was just a beautiful place. People in there like in business suits you. I mean, a little more off scale than this other walking clinic where it looked like all the people from the range you were in there. You know, I could get a kidnaps a little bit smart. Right. Like, I see home okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, who don't know if she's okay yet. Oh, but she is saying, yeah. Thank God. And say so anyway, go to that other place. They wait about a half hour, which isn't bad at all. I see a very, very nice doctor. He says, I show him my prescription. I explained the thing about I can't get the everything we feel here from the US. No problem. How many do you want? Give a hear of anybody. You ever heard of an American doctor say, how many do you want? No. He said, how about if I give you a hundred to start and I'll give you a refill for another hundred. So that's like, since it's a one-and-a-kind of a thing of blood center, platyvics since I had that stroke, that's like six and a half months. It's almost seven months for it. Thanks, doc. How much have cost me? I already put it. Yeah, that's right. 35 bucks can eat. It's about 22 bucks US. And I was more than delighted to pay. You know, I was so it's a little bit of a thing that make you do. I was ecstatic. And I take it to my shop where his drug mart. I get the prescription to fill. I go there yesterday. I got the drugs, ran my thing right now. And I'm, oh, oh, oh. I have no idea. Because I had like two pills left when this was all going on. One for two days. And I was trying other means of getting saying, I was sent here. But they just didn't work out, yeah. Because we got some really stupid people down there. But that's okay. Don't take it personal unless you feel like it. All right. Okay. How's this pulled one other than the yellow? We have fill Henry on there. Because again, I apologize when you've set that fill. Okay. Because that was really, I don't see it on there yet. See, I don't want to be pushy Eric, but fill Henry should have been. Oh, he is on there. He's got too already. Like I said, nice going Eric. Why are you always picking on Eric Carlos? You jealous? Must be. Just come. Oh, do you hear how he pressed these now? Just calm down. I understand that your life is probably being shortened by many years having to be associated with him. But it's the best we can do. He's a, oh, and you've got the cartoon on there too. Beautiful. Ha ha ha ha. Who did that? You sent it to Eric. No, I did that. No, I said one like I said, Carlos is the best. Not only do we have our 80 million great bedtime stories today. And look at this one. Elizabeth smart found a lie. He's a picture of Elizabeth. She really is a knockout. She's a cute little girl. Oh, she's 15. She's not a little girl anymore. He's beautiful. But I'm a little worried about that one thing I mentioned. Aren't you? I don't want to think about it. I know. It's a, I say we just cut his balls off if he has any left. Right on TV. Another thing way, the cartoon. The cartoon. There's a big, kind of looks like the beast. He's got his t-shirt. His sports t-shirt on his shorts. Big fat, tubby American guy. And he's sitting in his recliner. And he's surrounded by soda and the beer. Chips popcorn. Oh, he's got a, see an N war guy in his lap. And he's got the TV remote. He's sitting there with a little American flag in his beanie. Looking at the TV and says, OK, start the war. I'm ready. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, let's make a sport out of it. What do you say? So what was I talking about before I got to that? Something about on our website. A little bit smart. Now there's some great tremendous bedtime stories on there today. I apologize for sending you so many because I know it's a lot of work, but they're just, we just got to get them all on there. You know, about three, four, so on there now. Oh, and so in other words, we still had more to come. OK, and we're getting back to the survey. Jim managed 46 other than the, which radio personality, listen to most of the real interesting to see if these percentages change after 10 and then after 10 30 whenever Howard decides to give it up. Managed 46 Howard Stern 30 Randy Rhodes 22. I'm shocked. Aren't you? What why are you so shocked? She has a following, you know. That's why I'm shocked. Hey, Goldberg 21. Rush Limbaugh's got 10. What the, that, that, that, that, that, that, that. Why Rush running by young Paul. Old, the Paul have eight. Phil Henry's got six. We just put him on there seconds ago. You mark my words. He's going to give him a run for their money. Are you sure? Absolutely. How can I forgotten that? It wasn't done willfully on guarantee of that. It's just that I don't, you know, don't hear him. Yeah, that's stroke. Yeah, believe me. I remember everything. That's like, you're putting your position anyway. Well, Howard David is tied with Phil for six. I'm all last. Schnitz got six. The Schnitmeister. Dr. Wars got a pair. Do you want Mark have a pair? Mr. Ego Steve Cains got one. That was not interesting, huh? Of the former of the former radio talk, you know, I'm talking about the talk group. He kind of people ran these got 20 some odd and Mr. Ego. Just tell me what your problem has got one. Fully's got one. It he can has one. Rome has got one already. Big Lebband. It'll be so times you and Eric Schreiff have none. Now, what, how is that possible? Where's all the brothers and sisters out there? They're listening to, I guess they must be listening to EDR and Hot 105 now. Right. Remember you chased them all away with that song you were playing? No, I did not. No way, did not. Because when we did the thing on the year, remember all the votes. I had two pack got. You know how many you got, don't you? About 30 man. That was it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. How did 5, 60 on my AT&T and your Verizon marvelous line? Here's Brighton Beach, hello. A Voighton Beach. Where would it have had it? Brighton. Voighton Beach, yes sir. Brighton. Yeah. Happy hours of smart day. Have you heard? Happy hours of the smart day. And back to you. And you've got Bob and Tom. Oh yeah, Bob and Tom should be on here again. I'll decide out of mine. Very good. Thank you very much. And thank you. Welcome to Have a great life. Bob and Tom, well, see I'm not really a Palm Beach issue. Is there anybody in Palm Beach else that we ought to put on there? I don't think so. We just don't know the Palm Beach market all that well. I do understand that many of you like in Pointen like that guy and in Boca, whatever in West Palm, you think that Palm Beach is like part of our, it's just not. You know, we're static and delighted that you listen to us, but it's just, it's another planet, you know? It's a little league. It's a place where they vote for Papu Cannon. Hey, it's Howard. Howard Spam. Are you? Hi, I'm Aaron Summary. Do you know what? You got me talking on the passion phones. Tell me the story about how you got blown. I got you down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'll tell you one more before I hang up the phone. I got you down. The lines are jammed up. Yeah, there isn't a doubt. Call up and tell me what it's all about. I got you down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow. Oh, oh, oh. I'll tell you one more before I hang up the phone. I got you down. I got you down. I got you down. I got you down. Here on the show, there's a new topic each night. Don't you know it's sex with with a black or blue and white? I got you down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow. Oh, oh, oh. I'll tell you one more before I hang up the phone. I got you down. Okay, play that just to give you now with Phil to a pay him back for leaving him off to the first few minutes. And how could you not to remind me of that? Because I'll decide out of mind. I don't listen. You must be slipping man. Tell two or five, 60 W to Q and the Georgia Beyond Next Week. And here's your homework assignment. Even if he had George liked poison, we required that you listen to him every day all next week. Oh, why you doing that to these people? Because we need their help. We can't afford to have another round bad month. Well, they can just write it down. They don't have to listen. Ah. Well, not supposed to be saying. Oh, I know. No wonder they're going to come and take your ass away. They must listen religiously every day even when George is on. We need that badly. Okay. There you go. And the my advice to you is don't let them get to you. That's my advice. Don't take them personal because everybody in a brother is listening out. Even ones who claim they hate you like poison. And just always keep that in mind. Like remember? Why did you have to bring him up now? The Panthers are falling on tough times. They're going to have to be a good and score goal into the ocean on a home game. And you're picking on poor rumor. Okay. Just because he's eat. And whoever made that schedule out, what kind of a schedule is that? Air via other game. They play a home game. They go on a road. They come back play a home game. They go on a road. No wonder he and a whole guy. They have to keep them. No wonder judges are so sick. Plus he's bleeding from the back for all thanks to guilty. Because even now, Jugs know that guilty is like a stabbing. And rumors, and rumors, Gueldies in somewhere with the SPN radio looking for a job. That's somebody inside started yesterday. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, man. Um, At to your list. Uh, George Norie. How about who? He took over our bill. Oh, okay. She is so chronic that woman. And that voice as soon as I hear her voice, I want to kill myself. I mean, she made me a very nice lady, but the fact that she listens to that art bill. Whatever it is now. I know what I'm putting that down. Are we listening to that? Okay. Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me. What is it called? George one. Norie. How do you spell that? And oh. Are RRIY? I'll get up at the door. Yeah, look at the whole idea. I know I don't know what that is. Yeah. I have no clue what that is. George Norie. You will listen to the art bill show the outer. Oh, of course, probably some of your kinfolk are in the same. Just get off the ship. Him and Boko Brian. And when we go to lunch, I might as well just not even be there. Our voice is that this and then they had this guest. Oyster neck. Well, I think there's a look at that. That was up 111 point. All right. Next up 19. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, see we're turning the corner man on you doubters out there. And then when we go in and we get those long beheads. Oh, and look at this. I don't know if I put this to round a website or not. We're in the world as I racked it. I put that on or not. I guess not. Don't think so. No. This is, I know it's more the same business in America just doesn't care because I guess we enjoy being stupid. It says the US may be going to war with Iraq, but a survey finds an overwhelming number of young adults don't have a clue as to where the country is on a world map. Okay. They don't have a clue as to where the hell it is on a map. And have we been talking about that for years and years and years? How freakin' stupid American publicans? I don't have a clue. A nationalized European epic story. I don't have a clue. A nationalized European epic survey of nearly 3000 other adults between the ages of 18 and 24 finds that 87% of them can't find Iraq on a map. I wonder if they counted the present. Oh, he's too old for that. He's in a different category. Oh, look at that one. CBS Newsman Stephen Cuff and took a world atless along to a mall in Skokan Washington reports that. And reports that just helped support the surveys findings. I think there's a word left off at his page. He says, I was looking for Iran who's vexed and there's Turkey City Young woman. There's a man Afghanistan City, a man Saudi, Yemen, not Saudi Arabia's Saudi. Your finger passed right over at Puehden, Al-Kalpin. Iran Iraq, he exclaimed. With the threat of or focusing attention on Iraq, the National Geographic Society is issuing a new Atlas to the Middle East. The 96 page volume compiled by the Society's map makers goes on selling bookstores next week, and on a society's website immediately. It covers the history and current status of the 16-ation region under development since October. The Atlas has been issued about two weeks earlier than originally planned, because we want to get out before the war starts. So if Colis went to party started. The Atlas shows her back for example as a population of 20 feet point six million people, of which 4.9 million people have been in the capital that's in the bag, Dad. Every life expectancy is just 58 years, compared nearly 77 in the US. Each country has a separate section of the Atlas, which also includes maps in the major cities, including Baghdad, Jerusalem, Cairo, Damascus, and Tehran. The Education Commission of the States has geography as a problem in the AS schools. Reading in math, especially if you've got a lot of focus, I think social studies in geography have been taken up and pushed to the wayside, so Jennifer Dunay, a policy analyst with the ECS. She said the survey speaks loudly for students needing an international education complete with studies about World History, geography, culture, language or the countries, and of course language that their own country couldn't or either. If it gets my drift. Yeah, pretty amazing. Other than Neil, what the personality you listen to most on your radio, Jim Mad is 64-Hourits sperm 40. See if that changes any. You're watching it keep an eye on it. Sure. Randy Rose 27, Phil Henry's moved up to 23 already tied with Hank. Rush Limbaugh's got 22. Keep your eye on that one too, make sure that we don't have any free-presenter, assholes. Shnitz got 13, Paul and young Rhonda got 10, Mohar Davided 7. Dr. Laura Steve Kainav Ford, John Marka, Jim Romi has one, Romi Romi. Call me homie. I'm not too wrong, Sports Show. Tom Joyner and Fully Kennedy K. and Bob and Tommy Chavone. Big lip banded Rick Shaw and Albee still have the big. Nice bad. Don't you feel bad for Ricky Tickey? And what about George Norrie? We're going to get that one up there right away. That's when the votes are reading a start pouring in. Yeah, and O-O-R-Y. What do I care what this coming is? I mean, you'll put it on there. It'll be right. 253 votes so far. Once we get George Norrie under the votes are going to be pointed by the audience because it's the older space crowd, man. And we got a lot of those people like Carlos and the old voice to make book a brand. Want to hear about what Tommy went to ship land. That's them. The only space you pop on a sea land like right in my outside. He would be the one from smallville. Within a minute. Here's Boca. Hello. I'm more in the library. Okay, sir. Yeah, before I give you a name besides the owner of the pants is losing his ass on the hockey team. He's a company's stock in town about 50% this year. How do you like that? And I'm talking about. You know, you notice the trade deadline came and most of the teams did something to improve themselves and all they did was dumps salary again, get me to Val Burre and other stiff. And they got another right defenseman that nobody ever heard of another kid. And there's really no reason for people to come off because in performance at home is so dreadful. And you see for yourself, I know if you saw the game last night. But if it wouldn't have been for a long way, that would have been like a 10-nothing game. He plays great airbie game. He keeps it in the game, but they don't screw any goals in the home games. And he wants to pay to see that. That's right. Next year, it's going to be another bad year or also. I mean, you know, think about it. No, I don't have to think about it because who the hell are you going to get? And it looks to me. It looks to me like Dudley is paving away to say, hey, my keen and you want to go to New York or any place else. But by because he can see his assistant coaches that keen and brought in. He brings in his own two stiffs, including bringing back Sutter, which I have no idea why. And it's basically sending a message to Keenan like a nice tribe of Dubai. You know, and then we can save someone on your coaching salary, too. The feel later. There's another bleeding heart-level and Palm Beach County in the afternoon. Yeah. If you have it on the left, cannot. Joy's Kaufman. Joy's Kaufman is on the air. Oh, exactly. Thank you. Thanks for the bad news. Joy's Kaufman is still on the air. It's amazing. That is shocking. Yeah, the Panther organization, man. And of course they said, you know, they're going to save more money. Get rid of that 3.9 minute dollar salary, a brewery is getting Valerie. But the fact that it matters was same thing next year when it comes time to spend money on free agents. And it's just like they said before, get rid of the other brewery, Pavel. And somebody tells Sam Rosen, it's not bore, please. I like you, Sam, but you're full of crap. Well, I'm a sin thing again. They're not going to spend that money because they're losing their ass. They're losing their ass. What is this, uh, facts here? Good morning, Neil. First of all, I agree with the card. I mentioned QM, Jingle of live and local. He's right. I think it sounds great. It live and local. That's a great idea. That is us. Recrezier than a bedbug. If you don't believe us, just ask. He'll tell you. I've been a long time listening to you show. My usual routine with them. I've ready to tune to five 60 while having the mute button on the TV and switching around from CNN. MSNBC and Fox News. Oh, but recently, I got so sick of watching Iraq this and wore that. And the same coverage going on and on. Then I gave up trying to keep up with the news on TV. That only read newspapers for that fix. But I found the greatest way to listen to the Roger show. I have the radio blurring loud and proud. And I have the TV on with the old vitamins, which back and forth between the two Spanish channels. It's great. The women on those big stations are incredible. And I don't know a lick of Spanish. It's the worst out of perfect. But I guess he would like to lick it. I see enough TNA during those three hours that it satisfies my entire day. Just a little advice to past long, you listen. Give it a shot. Here you go. It is. If it's not too much trouble, could you pass a little time playing one of the old default bits for old time six? Hey, how come we didn't put Jeff in the forest on there? Good question. See? I mean, I didn't think this would be a list that we have to like, you know, I wish that right. Like this last guy talked a little hockey there for like 10 seconds. That was fine. You know, we're trying to bring them out of their shell a little bit as opposed to just say, Ah, I tried to compliment you know something. Something. Little something. It says that the one that comes to mind was soon after he was busted and keeps on saying, Thank you for your call. Do we know what that's called? Uh, Booker Brian Malok is a book for you. Thank you for your call. That's so many of those. Here's what it says. I was at the pan to game and they actually didn't have a good crowd of 10 to 12,000. What? Actually, we came in at 730. There was a line of 200 people purchasing tickets. The only problem was 75% were from Montreal. Well, they must have come in off the lake because this was in the middle of the first period. And they paned that place and it was empty. Okay. So if there were had a good crowd, they must have shown up a day late in $50 short. You know how many people I think really paid to see that game last night? I'm 30 man. That's it. P.S. Elizabeth Smart dropped the ceremony of a pocket to start the game. Oh, oh. Oh, and actually it was Gary Carter, which is why we really lost. He must have been trained to the wrong. God, Gary Carter. You shouldn't say that because he's rumors would close personal buddy and he used to be their neighbor, which I can't stand Gary Carter. I don't care, but we're okay if you want to take it personal. You're entitled. Just get on the plane and have a safe trip. But don't give me your Gary Carter crap or be easier stuff either. Another good born again. God, those born against man, those goodly two shoes. They're all so much better than we are. Not better than the Mormons. 1013 at 5.

Yeah. Here, peace. And thank you guys. I'm really surprised that she was found alive. Archie, I'm surprised we don't have a whole bunch of calls about Elizabeth's card. After all, she said 75 consecutive hours of coverage and that's like many hours before she was found. Yeah. Well, most of those cases as usually the Calvin's did. Well, you know, I thought so too, but yesterday on the news, they said that most of them are found. Now, you know, if you listen to one of these experts, they'll say most of them aren't found. They see if if they're alive after the first two hours, the chances are okay that they're going to be alive. I guess that's what I heard Tuesday because they said that if they're going to kill us, usually within the first two hours, but he didn't want to kill her. He wanted to keep her in his second bride. And you call up all places. Yeah. How do you like that? What a moron. Right. Okay. Thanks for the call, Kyle. Okay. Have a great day. Where do they get notions like that about second wives and multiple wives and things like that? From a crazy asshole, legend. You know, from Joseph Smith, M. Oh, R. Oh, and he left the other M out. Yeah, the one who the Bible was it. Oh, wait. I'm sorry. It was Joseph Smith, man. He had the tablets. Okay. And he said, take two and call us in a morning. He said, take two wives and call me in a morning and then take couple more. He also had 3 D glasses that he really. He was in Palmyra, New York, you know, yes, I do. You know where Palmyra is up there. Let me show you on the map. Oh, right now, it's right here. I rack. It's right near my rack. Five. Oh, I tell you, we could choose a lot more calls. We got five billboards up there. We have one call for each billboard. I'd be happy. No. Seriously, I was thinking about that during a break. If we could just get one call for each billboard, I feel like we're accomplishing something out there. But these people all they can do is just add a name to a list. You've got to break. You've got to have a little bit more than that. Come on, folks. I'm sure you can do it. When I've heard your blow in a goddamn world, I've got to go to war any goddamn day. We hate the freedom fries. We got a Elizabeth smart as home occasion is not on that story. After nine months of disappearing, and we thought that she might be dead, and this comeback, preacher, uh, goofball, polygamous, run off with her, and we found her yesterday. Thank God. She's still alive in a good shape. But like I said, I'm a fear. Some other crap may have gone down. I'm pretty sure all of these things. And these people are like, you know what they remind me of. They remind me of Mrs. Wallace on passions. You know, after Beth keeps putting the duct tape, you got to use do the time.

That's that's what I liked. He said you do great radio. I'm just getting choked him. What am I now? Greg, the George Newies got one. Yes, he Carlos, you tell him when we have put that on there.

The ifos got about 75 billboards all over the place in his hand him for months and months and months. And they spent it with their own money, they're on the light bulb. And he's got nobody listening. How do you like that? So based on with the vast audience we've had over these last five and a half years or you stay, have anyway, we ought to have like a hundred billboards. But we'll settle for the five. Oh, I hate to write the newest year moment. There's another mystery one that looks like it's going up in near the, you know, my, me international. And guess who that's going to be again. Oh, god. Yeah, you only get one, Mo, okay. You haven't earned more than one. I want to do it with listed billboards. That's an important thing. Isn't that?

The one good thing is that I get to call every day from somebody in middle or upper of a management there at QMC. You doing all right, now you're feeling anything? Halip on the HG and the C unlike our radio station, they do be professional grade. And more, this is the course for the O56. We're the two and a half. First, first, come on out! The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to dominate people guilds with the gas that we stole him. First time a crescer nation had me only one that's going. Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil to it. Forget about Korea. The Newster told you that the right queen is really getting over and over to our head. And the rag has some weapons of past destruction. Three thousand people killed. On an out-for-got, I've exploited a bit stand. Eight, there's oil to be knotted. Going after set down to play Keto Sama, there's no longer mention of the name in Lottis. Let's know and see if concerned all of them. A fee and complacent believe in every word of this cartel-in-minute station. Back and throw this by fear through the E.M. And the clearly shamanna, who lies queen is really getting over and over to our head. And I rag Keto, weapons of past destruction. The last civil rights is the right that we're paying. We're all suspects now, not the ass-profit is the end. I have nothing to hide. Table partners all are saying, I know being in cattle don't have any reservations. Now don't provoke battle ends. We're all annihilation. Odrigin must fall, it's have a virgin and stoke. With no objection at all. Till the crackdown have the fall and the right queen is really getting over to our head. Till our parade was bent. I rag Keto, weapons of past destruction. How only I rag Keto, weapons of past destruction. What a effen genius, you know, he's just amazing. Never know what to look at him with that oyster neck, I'll tell you. It goes to show you. Exactly. 1049. Oh look at that, it lives a bit smart, he's home, he's saying, oh, right. I just saw that on the corner of my eyes. Yeah, God, what am I citing today, you know? I wonder if he was so good. Let's take a look at this pool and boy, they are pouring phony votes in on here like they're coming from the sky, you know what we don't care, just crank him in there, Eric likes that. Let's get 50 million hits today. And on the website too. How does the Neil, what radio personality do you listen to most? Jim Mad Dog Manage 96. The Mad Dog is God. Oh, right. There you go. Wow. How come easily got one billboard? I guess you don't need it, right? I guess. Plus I guess the fact he follows this show and then be a good pull question. Who'd you rather follow? Mohour David or Uncle Neil. Jim Manage 96, Howard sperm six, the eight, or how do you like to follow Marlon's baseball? No. Sorry Hank. Rush Limbaugh 64. Phil Henry 59, Schmidt 57. See that's what makes the Rush number look very suspect to me. Is that Rush and Schmidt are like moving up rapidly on a list? Don't believe it. Randy rose 37. Wow. She started working with a bang man and then kind of Peter. You know what I mean? Right. I mean she's still doing pretty good, but hey, Goldberg 36. Randy's got more than Hank. I don't believe it. Paul and Young Ron 15 on Zeta. Mohour David and stuck on eight. Bob and Tom also have eight. Boy, can you imagine if Bob and Tom are on morning's remonstration? Oh, would we kick answer what? They are great. Dr. Laura's got me a question. They don't do a sports show. They do a lot of indie 500 stuff that time of the year, but they don't do a sports show and Greg wouldn't like that. But this is the only time I've ever worked on a radio station where we have to have a format to suit the general manager's mentality. Do you see what I'm saying? Yeah. I never really thought about that up until this moment. We have to be really, and fact, even when before we started on the station, in some of the discussions I had with Tanner and some of those other glam, it was very obvious that they would like to have a try to move him away away from so much sports emphasis, away from it. See what I'm saying? Because they realize that it's narrow casting. It's like people are talking about golf every day. It's narrow casting. Anyway, Mohs got eight. Bob and Tom, a Dr. Laura, Joe and Mark F. 5. The cane monster Mr. Ego's got four as does Roe Me and Tom Joyner. Eddie Cays got three. Putty's got a pair and I's going for you idiot. Got to see an asshole. Big lip ended too. Jeff the force got a vote. Oh! Joe Rose got one. Ricky Tickie Shaw's got one. George Norris still got poker Brian's. Votes still got the same one. Joyce Kaufman's got one. And I'll be so catch none. Well that's because we have no crossover with Power 96, you know? Right. Do we? Of course not. We don't have those young punks. They listen to Power 96. They don't even know where to fight us on the dial. Tying. Yeah. Huh? Tying who leaps. Right. Forget about finding a racon. And map those punks to listen to Power. They don't know where to help. We are. Or who we are. I think about us. And it's probably just as well. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes sir. How are you man? Pretty damn good. It's uh, how long it'll help here. So we don't want to feel like it. And it's warm enough here. Gonna be 50 this weekend. Man, we are excited. Oh. People might around in shorts. Andy, I'll read it. I'll call you um. Don't you think that uh, if the guy really finances terrorists activity uh, tell them us a doll and uh, he's in a. He's in a. He's in a. There was a thing in the paper this morning. He's still sending 10 grand to the uh, Palestinian terrorists. Well, don't you think that's reading or not to get them to hang out out of there? No. No. I think what you've had to do is contain them like we contain the Soviets for like 50 years. But I'm going to war and kill in a bunch of uh, innocent people. And so what? And opening up a can of worms that we have no idea what the repercussions are going to be. Well, yeah, you got to you got, you got, you know, I'm going to stand. Let me ask you. Let me ask you this question. They keep saying, well, for 12 years, he's flooded the world of the. You went, what has he done in the last 12 years? I mean, other than, you know, the send it. He's texted the Palestinian terrorists. What has he done in the last 12 years? Did he invade another country since we got about a. Kuwait? No. No. Did he guess any more of his own people? Which the Kurds aren't we, his own people? But did he? No. He's a dangerous man with a lot of money. And let me ask you something. Aren't there a lot of other dangerous men with a lot of money? Yeah, but he's in a position of, you know, to I think to do harm. Based on what? And he, anything, wait, wait a minute, when you've got somebody cornered, when you got the microscope on him on every move that he makes and everything that they do. And if they would like double our tribunal inspectors and put a UN peacekeeping force in there. And like expand the no fly zone, you'd have him locked up, tighter than a drum. So we're still not at, on our ass and wait for him to decide to do something stupid. Yeah, you didn't listen to what I just got through saying. No, I understand what you saying. You know, a lot of surveillance. If you had Ted Bundy and his dangerous as he was, if you had him locked up in a small cell, and you kept your eye on 24 hours of age surveillance and never let him out. You think he could have killed any more women? No. And at the point, that's the point surveillance works. And they are including a house open for yesterday's polls. And people forgot, we know cook. That guy's about to cook. Okay. What was yesterday's poll? Who's going to die first to celebrity? Oh, Bino cook. He's hoping I think it'll be. Oh, yeah, that would be good. That would sure get Hank's ratings back up. They're all, uh, Clarence told me that Bino was a very high-illistened show. They actually figured that out. They extrapolated? Yeah. And he decided that. The Bino's worth that. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon world. Let's face it, Sodom's a bad guy. He gased his own people. He invaded another country. He drank water out of a creek. On the deal, that the bris water to make him know that six point deal had to reto be on TV and yeah, and saying that he wasn't going to do, uh, uh, uh, the master structure. The one, they, they actually had a deal going there for a while. Well, look at this, erected delivery ports on VX nerve agent and trash breaking news. Shoes and there are many outstanding issues when it comes to chemical and biological weapons. Let's go to the United Nations right now and check in with Richard Roth, which. No, that's not. But anyway, the one thing that was the stomach block is where he said Sodom was going to have to play 18 round a whole Zagolf with Prince Charlie and where the kills in the long stock in the middle of the day. And he had a little bit of a black gum. It's day, dude. You can play any time. And five six, oh, W Q A. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You could have my cool spades. His eyes can't even tear off. Once wrong with my cool spades. He wears the doctor's mask whenever he goes outside. When they're just head to surgery, he's we know he lies. He like a gay show boy. I'm rousing go too high. A holy clamped in his chair. He don't look like a guy. He's a guy. Dumb and hip, or jack on a cage. What happened to my cool spades? He wears up with my cool spades. Yeah, the whole thing's out of play. Doesn't have lips like Randy Montenegro made or keep toes. You'd be more likely to see that face and man than to those. If you're depressed, take your arm. You could have my cool spades. I said can't even tear off. Once wrong with my cool spades. He's strange creature. Here's wrong about his face. What happened to my cool spades? It's 11 on 3 and 5, 60 W Q A. I'll just call me in the middle of a swing of my diet. I would be back. If you know about people drink diet coke and positive. Anyway, this passage is rather sad because I guess somebody out there in the audience is very naive. It says the reality of this administration sadly for them enjoys to us. Is that they are kindergarten bullies preaching, Schmitt, the logical thinking Americans we've had time to think it out. He can't get away with it and he's going to realize it soon. Well, nothing could be. He's got a totally backrights. He is getting away with it. He's getting away with it now. He's got the American people easily brainwashed. He's led. Just keep repeating the same bull crap over and over again. Just like that guy was on a couple calls. He's a dangerous guy. I'll tell you one thing. Kim Jong-Eel is not only dangerous, but not only has no f's. But he's a crazy as a bedbock. He's not just an evil doer. He's a crazy evil doer. He's a evil crap. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. He's got it. These are the same people that were doing business five years ago with the Sodom or that evil doer. Right. Halibut and the Texas Company, which has been awarded the Pentagon's contract to put out potential oil field fires in Iraq, and which is bidding for post-war construction contracts. Is still making annual payments to its former chief executive, the vice president Dick Cheney. The payments which appear a Mr. Cheney's 2000 month financial disclosure statement are in the form of the fur compensation of up to $1 million a year. When he left Halibut and 2000 become George W.s. running made he up to not receive his leading payment in the lump sum, but instead have it paid to him over five years possibly for tax reasons. And a to the vice president said yesterday, this is money that Mr. Cheney was owed by the corporation as part of his salary for the time he was employed by Halibut and which was a fixed amount paid to him over time. The company would not say how much the payments are. The obligatory disclosure's statement filed by all top government officials say that they're only in the range of $100,000 and a million dollars. Whatever that means, and or is it clear how they're calculated. Halibut is one of five large US corporations. The others are the Bechtel Group, floor core Parsons Group and the Lewis Burger Group invited a bit for contracts. It will make it out to be the biggest reconstruction project since WWE 2. It says to me that it will be worth up to $900 million for the preliminary work alone such as rebuilding Iraq's hospitals, ports, airports and schools. In other words, in the long run, we're talking about multi-billion dollar contracts. So obviously, money's got nothing to do with it. The more that you're hurting about Richard Pearl, money has nothing to do with that either, which is Robert your pro is so we're going back because he's so bent out of shape. Right. So we're buying the loan because what we're buying the bombs and then we're going to rebuild the buildings that we blow up at the bombs that we've on. Right. Now you got it. Do you think we can rebuild the people that we kill? Well, they can do that. Here's a call from West Palm Beach. Hello. Yes? I've been working for 10 years. You're holding on to him. Fuck, bad man! 560, 0560, pound 560. And it's so little time. You guys with the butterfly net's out there that are running around so little time, so much work to do. One last call on the board, and then I guess we'll go to play in all these great bits that we've got because I got another say today. Yeah. That's here. It's tragic. It's a national scandal. And this guy's talking about, oh, you can't talk like a bunch of kindergarten kids in the American public. Right. Who are you, kid, Mr? What kind of are you living on? Well, they're going to have to son his out. It's a beautiful day, man. What a clock comes. I'm going to hit the street. I'm going to go out there and have me a nice lunch. Good. You bet your sweet ass. I'm going to go out there and have me a nice lunch. I'm going to read all the newspapers. Fine. I want to read it going out in the real world. Most of the snow is melted and just like vanished out there. It's a fantastic life baby. Who would be any place but there. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah. As far as the freedom of five go, they're going to get real serious and have freedom of ticklers. It's a good point. Yeah. That's right. What we talked about there. Freedom kissing. Mm-hmm. Oh, it was about this home. Here's a good day. Oh, baby. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If we're a little bit smart as home. Her dad calls for a national amber alert. He's been fighting for that since he disappeared. But don't you think that I'm not being smart when I say this. But with all the confusion we got already on the yellow alert and the orange alert on the terror alert. I mean, how many alerts can we have? You know, well, let's dispense with that silly horse crab. That would be a good idea. There's a happy amperma right. We have missing kids like we're really going to mean something as opposed. We don't want people like running to the windows and jumping out for his out of his stereo. Every time we get another one of these damn alerts go. I mean, let's poppy top. Right. To pacify the public. Just like the duct tape. You know, again, this goes back to that facts that I write about the kindergarten thing. I want you to stop and think. They said that, oh, I don't know what the percentage was. But there was a significant percentage of the American populace. And we know it because they ran out to their home depot and all their hardware stores. Most of the coast and they bought up the duct tape and the visc queen and the bottled water. I mean, duct and then and then he had a week later when they were getting ready to lower the alert again. I come to find out that a lot of it was based on phoenix information. At that point, he gets up there and he's starting to make jokes about, well, store the duct tape. Oh, yeah. You know what that reminds me of? It's like these press conferences. Here we're talking about embarking on saying going into uncharted territory. We have no idea what's really going to happen here. Okay. With this little thing that we think we're going to accomplish in a couple of days. We don't really know what kind of head doors box we're going to open up. What kind of a Tinder box we're going to set off. And in the meantime, every time they have one of these press conferences, we got their yucketed up. I like it like it's some kind of a sports press conference or something. Yeah, like it's an exercise. And we're on sale. The courses have been doing this ever since 9.11. Since he started having his practically daily pow hours with the media. They're his little daily shadow boxing with the media. Ha ha ha ha ha. I like it to make jokes. Gangway, paint the only thing that's funny. Yeah, I get it. I guess it is. 560, 50560 pound, 50. Should Congress pass a national amperler, measure to aid in locating missing children. See an inseskin on their full 7% know 92% say. Yes, course they should. It works. In fact, the people have found her in these two scumbags. They're recognized to the guy from TV. They said we know it was him because he looked just like the picture that we've been seeing on TV. How do you like that? What are you laughing about? Why are you chuffling? Oh, remembering that bit. Oh. Let's take a call from Fort Lauderdale, huh? Hello? Yes, sir. Hey, Neil, how are you doing? Okay.

This is sports, we need a little bit of foot. Fusion's head coach and I love the queen of so-flard and Neil Rogers should be in the book and impolice but we'll keep him here. You sang the Irish songs and did the Irish gig. Dance naked on the bar but you don't recall who is. You made the best of your Saint Patrick's day dance time. Don't ask the question why your hand becomes inside. It's something quite predictable. The things you did last night. You never drank more beer in your life.

Why my second power is kicked in again. Nice going. Dude, good. What's not just talking about Prince Charles, you were. Here's the mixed raw scandal. Conveniently is on a two day tour of Bulgaria. If you please, it comes Charles as actually said that he finds this report Uncomfortable reading but that he does take the blame and the responsibility. The man who's resigned, Michael Forset. He has the charming nickname of Forset the fence because he's the one who's plugged all the royal presence and kept 20% from self. But you know, isn't it convenient? He resigns today not a word of him in this report and not a word of his resignation about why he was going. Other than the spend more time with his family. Isn't that great? He must have what? He makes Mr. Ab look like I know he wears dentures. A senior royal aid to the Prince of Wales Prince Charles body-pinched Charlie with the Kiltz has quick to spite a report and a royal household saying it found no wrong doing by servants. The inquiry criticized for being handed by Charles private secretary Sir Michael Pete. Recommended title controls and procedures but uncover no evidence of serious wrong doing despite expressing misgivings about some stack practices. Is that stiff practices? It was commissioned to look at allegations that Royal gifts were sold by the Prince's staff and was sparked by the collapse of the trial of Prince of Dinos Butler, Paul Barrell last November. Look at back to you, Diana. Michael Forset at the Center of an internal inquiry to St. James Palace will work for the Prince on a freelance basis. The UK Press Association reported today. Prince Charles on an official visit to Bulgaria. I've got to put him on. He just sends me right to the Charles. He says he will implement the recommendations but frankly, Carol, it's going to take much more. They're not going to get a white wash report. We're a grey wash. One white wash is a little bit more. I was just going to say, Mike, this effect is chances to be king, but we have to go. So you have to answer me quickly. Absolutely not. I love it. Accursations in the meeting that falseted, so it gives them to come from the sales to the report said. In short, we found evidence of staff by selling gifts around the items of that authorization or taking their commission to unsales. The inquiry also examined the fallout from the Burrell trial and the allegations of cover up amid accusations of homosexual rape by one of the Prince of Wales's AIDS. How do you like that? What do you talk about that? Huh? No question about that. In fact, maybe maybe he was in the Mosheur when he heard gang rape is funny. Maybe that's what the convincing to be doing. Anyway, there he go. There's the lady scandal from the rural family. And here we're paying attention to what they're saying. We're worried about them. What the Brits are saying these are allies. These silly geese. That's pretty sad. That's the best we can do. Here's a real chronic factor who says, I was flipping station last weekend into familiar voice. Alice Rand tell was I'm with Sean Hannity. A lot of combo that is spouting hate. Spouting right-wing self-hating crap. What is it with these self-hating queens like him and Miss Drog? And of course, you left out Andy Sullivan and the formerly David Brock. Yeah, that whole thing with a self-hating fact, it turns my stomach man. It makes me want to put my gut out. Self-hating right-wing fact. It's I guess they have a death wish. Isn't that what it must be? Got to be. 560505060 on the AT&T line. Here's for Lauderdale, huh? Hey Neil, hey, Don. Great. Speaking of turning your stomach, how come every public press conference now has to talk about religion, including the smart thing with these uh, with the dude Lucifer, whatever is made. Oh, yeah, doesn't make you nauseous? And then he's done the other than the parents coming back and there's the uncles coming back and saying the miracle stuff and then Bush talking about him getting one of these in the white house and been lying and getting one his needs. Yeah, Monica said she got on her knees into White House too. This is this is I mean, I'd like they should tell of us want to bush his prayer sessions. It's it. No thanks. No thanks people to puke and all over the country. That's what I mean. It put it up against the Dom praying in his power. Well, let me say this year about the smart people and bring in that God crap into what it's like people that survived on 9 11 or other horrendous like playing crashes. What about all the other people? How come God didn't take care of all the other kidnaps children that want them getting murdered within the first two hours. All the other kidnaps people like Sean Relevi. How come God didn't take care of them? Of course, Sean Relevi. We know the answers. Hey. Okay. The wrong God. Dr. Career smart. That's the key. Neil, what other thing? Yes, sir. Second biggest phonyist that's phonyist issue going now is this medical malpractice cap stuff. In Brevard County, whether it's 500,000 people, there has been one medical malpractice verdict for a plaintiff in six years. Yeah. In a lens. And I have no sympathy. Man, the medical professionals are disgrace. They don't. They don't monitor their own. They allow these butchers to keep doing their thing. And I have no sympathy for them. It's a complete joke. It's statistics. If you look at the statistics itself, the figures itself. There is no ridiculous. The doctors take 3% malpractice insurance now. They want to go to 2%. Like that's going to make a difference. Yeah. Okay. Good luck to us, pal. Thanks. See you around. Five, six, seven, five, six, six. The pound, five, six. The on a most doctors are butchers. I'll tell you that right now. Most doctors. They wouldn't look at them. Wort if you saw it if you added on your nose. Or it's that. I'm serious. They know they could diagnose a common cold. I'm not saying there aren't a few good doctors. But if you find one besides my friend, Dr. Hampton, if you find one, let me know. She's great, but other than that. I can't say too much about any of them. I do mean any of them. I wouldn't wish him on a Sodom. 26, past 11 at 5, 60, W. K. I'm on a great Thursday. Boy, you want to see what I'm looking at.

Jeff Cohen is the master when it comes to serving you up great Italian food at very teeny tiny prices. Big portions and what I love is that everything is cooked fresh. You'd go into a lot of these so-called Italian restaurants. And the pasta is like pre cooked, you know, hours ahead and then they'll sit there and like water. Oh, and by the time it gets to you, it's mushy and everything is authentic. Cook tea or to the way you love it. It pizza lock and a dispensational taste of difference. Three different kinds of great pizza garlic rolls that will just have garlic dribbling down your chin. There's nothing like having a dribbled on your chin.

And they do take out Carriai. What is it delivery? And also catering for any of our ferry may be having going on. And they do us to punish Jeff for as low as five bucks per person too. Two locations for an island. Grower pizza lock is growing like topsy. Well, not quite as fast, but they're doing it.

Right behind here what imports, kitty corn of the new Armadillo Cafe with acres of free parking and fantastic deals. Here's the number in Davy. It's 9.5.4.9.168.80. 9.5.4.9.168.80. The world flaming pizza lock. Drandy West. And they don't come any better than me or Neil Rogers. Two. This is top Kennedy. I haven't even welcome the name that too. Tonight our fight list will last week will have a chance to win our million dollar jackpot. Let's meet our finalist right now. Mr. Duff Lindsey. Good back, Jeff. Thank you. I'm a little nervous right there. Oh, don't be nervous. You did fine last week. This should be a breeze. All right. Let's get you that million dollar jackpot. Are you ready for the first two? Yes. I've been practicing all week. Okay. Then here we go. They way here the first two and please. Stop. Thank you, got it. Yeah. I'm going to have an ad-norton. You are correct, so. That's a good old movie. Okay. This is the big moment. You can quit now or see if you're... Oh no. I want to go for a jackpot. Very well. For one million dollars. Name this two. There's something wrong, though. Maybe you didn't hear it right? Yeah. Again from Mr. Lindsey. That's all we're gonna do. Love the 33. At 560 WQM. I'll tell you one thing. I hope everybody else enjoyed today as much as I am. Yeah. This has been special. You know what I'm saying? That's good. Really. That's good. These like this don't come along very often in a lifetime. At least not a misshow. Anyway, I've said it. They're pouring in all kinds of oats on a pool. Some of them real loud. We don't care. Just have a wonderful time. Other than Neil, what radio personality? All in by the way, CNN reports. He is God or representative of God. And he clearly has some mental health issues. See, but there you go. It's going to hand in hand. God in the mental health issues. The God squad. Elizabeth's home. That's the report. Anyway, Jim, I'll other than Neil, what person out of you listen to. Let me just say this about this pool. Because we did this before, a couple, I think a couple years ago. Before at least over a year before Mad Dog was on every day. And back in those days, Phil would always vary the competition. Are you sure? Am I right? Yeah. For those? Yes. Not even close. But now that Mad Dog is on every day, between one of three by the way, following the show Monday through Friday on QA, we're radioish. He just, the not everybody weighs about 120 votes for Mad Dog. How it's during his got 106th his percentage is back almost 17, which I knew he'd go up a little bit after he got off the year. Russel in ball 79, Schmidt 73, which would do be us. And Phil Henry's got 70. See what I'm saying? Hmm. Now I don't doubt that. Even though we put him on a little bit late, but not very late. And the reason being that you both, you when I forgot to put him on at all. Because out of sight out of mind, I mean, he's on a right night on a marginal station. If he plays the heat teams have to time at night. And he just don't even think about it anymore in our market. I mean, he's doing just fine. But I mean, in the South Florida market, he's just like an active thought compared to what he used to be. Hey, Goldberg 42, Randy Rhodes 42. She's still hanging in there. What shocks me? Shocking. Paul and old Ron 18, see the difference there. 42 all the way out of 18. Bob and Tom 11 and Wil Howard David 11. Bob and Tom and have a lot more than 11 of anybody could hear him in Broward and Dave. Like if they were on this station in the morning. In fact, is that interesting? Bob and Tom and Wil Howard David at each have 11. You see what I'm saying here? Yeah. And they're not even in a market. Yeah. What does that tell you? So if they were on this station in the morning, man, they probably have like 600 votes already. Two on Mark 8, Alby Silk has seven. Do we believe that? Sure. What do you mean? Sure. He didn't have any last time. It was very popular just by Osmosis. There's got to get out of here. You must be dream and man. Alby Silk has got seven right. Maybe seven fingers on one hand. You don't have those seven. Jim Rome Rome has got six times join her and Dr. Laura and Steve Kaney Chav six. Eddie K for Greg Newer George Newer he's got four Artville Junior. Vivo has three Flutty and Rick Shaw and the big lip band in enjoys California. You think Joyce has big lips? And Joe Rose has one. Who's only like part time anyway. The big lip band it's tied with Joyce Kaufman. It's Joyce Kaufman. I think he's so wonderful. 567. 560. 560 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. Here's Miami. Hello. Every day. Every day. What is it? Hold music. I don't know. It's just it sounds so it's like fuzzy. Right fuzzy generic old music. Well, the Beastie Boys have a war profile song. Have you seen it? Yeah. The book of Brian Givetine? No. Put it on this. You can download or write on the internet if you want. Of course I couldn't do it here because I know audio on my computer but you can do it. Is that it? Yeah. Well, you got on this one. It's a little bit of a rock. Nice dude. What are you doing? What are you doing? Feeling what to go Beastie. Beastie Boys have a war profile song. And that's what it goes like. It's like a call to a profile song when you can't understand a freaking lyrics. That recent most recent mobit. That's what they sound like. Maybe too many bad drugs. 560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's a call from Clearwater. Hello. How are you doing? Great. You know every time I drive by what used to be Clearwater Mall, I get like warm and fuzzy feelings of when you showed up there. When you were on a radio station I'm sure that had no promotion. WSUM. Right. And nobody knew that the radio station existed and you pulled like 6000 people into the fold mall. Yeah, that's true. Well, you're exaggerating a little bit but I think it was about 5000 we had in the mall in the beginning there and then for some reason they just after last it started attacking us or for whatever reason we didn't belong on your in Tampa though and I'd like this in the beginning and then what's they noticed they hated this? You know I cannot believe that shit is big in Miami. This guy is the worst talk show host. He's awful. He's like I always tell everybody he has vintage WFLA and then when I found out that he is on FLA and he does the show from there. I just about fell off the goddamn chair because he sounds like everything that's wrong with FLA. Exactly. I mean he is aesthetic and awful and then I see I just I'm looking at your pole on the web and I see Steve Kane is still alive. Yeah, he's hanging on. Isn't he about 114 years old now? Yeah, but he's got all brand new body parts. So he looks like not over day over 90. Oh, okay. So that worked out well. My only one question to you other than the fact that you are the wife to tell you I was talking to a gentleman in his wife out near his owner who are religious delits and they own a radio network and they were looking for talents. I said the very best talk show host in the entire universe is at neorodgers.com and they look you up and they call me back and told me that Satan was working on me on a regular basis. That's correct. And I should absolutely but you know Neil is so good. Whatever happened to Jazz McCay. My second favorite Miami talk show. I think he looked with Joyce Kaufman. I think he's stuck with that big box. He's still working. I you're asking the wrong guy man. I have no idea. I hope he's on the outside for a change. And I was up in West Palm a few years ago and I heard Randy Rhodes and it was so damn irritating. Yeah, she's irritating. Right. But he is going to stop. Don't worry about any warm man. She's going to solve all the problems of the world by this weekend. So I have no fear because the goddess is here. Hey Neil have a marvelous day. Have a great life pal. Bye. Here's an ice cough from clear water. We had a good call from Lansing. One from Clearwater. The calls in town of course a little bit hostile. And we're used to that after all these years. 20 till noon. I would say Tommy brought in a production order for drug concepts and with your voice. No, it's not this guy's anything about that with me now. I know nothing about that. So what's the answer? How about you, Pern? I mean, I hate to have to discuss this on the air. But well, why not? Why shouldn't we? Because it needs to be produced or not as the case may be. No, I don't we don't I don't do that. Okay. I do not do I do not be doing that. I'm not done. I'm not going to start participating on the light bulb. Let's see how often press eggs go off in 15 years sentence thrown out. Seasle Collins. Oh my god. We're going to have to play Seasle's lament on with this. Yes. A state of peel score to throw out the 50 years sentence of former dolphin running back. Seasle Collins ruling that the judge in his burglary trial did not give his relatives a chance to testify this behalf. The fourth district court of appeals on Wednesday. I'll tell Collins burglary conviction for sticking to his neighbors apartment while they slept early in the morning of December 16th, 1889. What is that? 99. But the panel throughout the sense because Howard judge Joyce Julian sentence Collins within an hour of the jury's verdict despite protests from his attorneys. They need to have to find Collins parents and coaches from Louisiana to testify. How do you like that? So there you go. You go Seasle. So when you see a face at your window, 19 till noon at 5.60 WC.

The 31-17 vote came after a month to debate over the New Yorkshire's stake out a position, if we're going to be looking for a fight-let's fight-poverty, let's, a Democrat who supported the resolution. Democrat Alan Jennings said that after losing one of his closest friends in the world-trance center attack, he was in no mood to vote for an anti-war measure. Our troops are in the Middle East at this time to fight for our democracy, Jennings said, I think this resolution sends the wrong message for a man and woman in uniform. The resolution back to war only if other options for achieving compliance with you and resolutions calling for elimination of weapons to mass destruction and the means of their development. Other sensitive temperant-taboral resolutions have been approved in cities including LA, Kalamazoo Michigan, Kalamazoo, Portland, Maine and Milwaukee. We're dealing with Milwaukee. They eat a lot of brought work from the drink a lot. 560, 750, 50, pound, five 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line. Here's a call from Kendall. Didn't hear a word he said, what do you say?

How about after the next break so that we can go, uh, and, or you go out and hold it? Yeah, I mean, the door keeps opening up. When are you going to play that again? Yeah, so I'll run it. Okay, we just played that now and, you know, hold them off. Like a townfire, I'll run up and on the hall. How is the poor coming other than Neil? And even I noticed in that spot you did, you said, by the way, Oh, no, what? You're going to Carlos? That was in the copy. I'm not taking the blame for that one. Carlos, you're he said, by the way, even in the spot. Can't help himself. Other than Neil, what radio personality, you listen to most we've got and we got, look at the votes, George, 672, do you believe it? No, no, but it's fantastic. Jim Manage 126. Howard Stern, 114. Worse Limbao 80. The Schmidt, mysterine, Phil, are tied 76. Are you sure? Although Phil's votes are for real, I'm sure. Hank 47, the goddess 45. And then it's small, small tiny potatoes after that.

Rick Shaw and the big live band of their tied with two a piece. Ice going Rick and Joe Rose has got one. Joe's got one. In fact, that may account. I'm not going to be able to do it, yeah. I just got so much stuff piled up on here. It's just like I'm all over the place. They're just a lot of stuff going on here today. Maybe that's why Joe says, oh, like the wee week. That's what I was going to say to me. The evening wasn't worth it. It was the effect. Yeah, whatever. Okay, five six seven. So what did the guy say to poor Iraqi people that was the negative guy that was the asshole. He's not going to be on here. Okay, what he says. The moment I hear your voice, you're off. We had to dump out in a new vanish. Okay, you and the adjord tape sky. It's just no point. There's just no point in putting up with it. You're just an imbosal. Plus his voice is so God, I'm annoying that that's semi-wisper crap. It's just when you like to do a him with a baseball bat just shove it right up his back. Oh, man, just beat him over the head with it. Here's my any, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm driving so I don't have a computer. Can you put my vote in for me? Can I put your vote in for you?

Make it in the big movement today. I can all you can feel it in the air. So at noon, we're going to be playing at Moan Doreen. But that's very big inside the building. See now what you're trying to do, which may not be all that creative an idea is program my show based on the the desires of the people inside the building. Oh, no, just passing along the request. No, no, I'll play it. I never, I never turned on the request inside the building. I just hope that the audience is like, I'll be in out of shape and psychotic because George is like, you know, sticking his nose in again. Five sick. See, when you know, he's so sensitive against it. It's just it's just a play. Yeah, you know, yeah. Yeah. Well, if you went to dinner better job and sitting with my god damn pills, so I didn't nearly have to have another stroke running all over town from one clinic to another. If you find it a dog, although I still I'm so impressed the way that he was a young doctor. I mean, you know, just he's new as crap. In fact, even told me a little bit more about the platyx. Certainly than the other people did a Cleveland clinic. Oh, he said it's it's one of those things you take every day and the benefits of it increase over time. You know, there are many drugs like that. You know, like, in fact, like a legura. If you just take it once, it might not do anything for our allergies. Yeah. But if you take it regularly, the effect of this increases over period of time. Got it? Got it. There you go. And but frame to say, how many do you want? I didn't know what to scream or appear my banana. I didn't know what to do with that. Why how many do you want? If I would say, how about yeah. That was great. Anyway, it's me out of prescription. He says, take care of yourself. And good luck. And have a nice day. And I go to the counter. And she says $35, please. And that's Canadian. That's like $22. $22. $22. This is Dick Cheney. I like to relax by having very diagonal. And massage my balls while listening to the nail rotters 12 to one hour. Okay. Hey. And so we got here another installment of Inspector Kilimbo Holiday David in a show. Yeah, wow. We got J. Fiddler coming up as a very special guest in it. And after that, we got another very special guest coming up to my road. That will be a J. Fiddler. What are you doing now? Mouth. What are you doing? Mouth. Come on, clip in my nose here. What's it to you? You just can't do a morning show and cut your nose here. And ready, I'm gonna do about it. It's my show. I don't know what I want. Ow! Just like I was telling that stream intent they called our readers. That's not nice. Ready, I'm made not nice. You see the size of that brondon? Talk about jumble, somebody ought to paint. Yes, I know what I'm gonna do. And I don't wish you know about promotions anyway, yeah. The only thing she's good for is keeping that farmer's happy. Why don't you even need an entire ham? Ow! Just back in and out. Yeah, I can smell the brondon at your mobility. You have to go on the air and save those nasty things about me? Oh, there you come into my place of business. Don't you know we'll lie to him? Like I'll go with him. I've had enough. You promised to hold dead right here. Peace, wearing fossilized, metal, muzzle, film, motherland. I'll see here, Fathau. You're fired. Hey! You fast-mo-common, hear me? Oh, I'm gonna push. I don't know where the fan is. Go put on his face, get going and crush him. I'm between my buns. I'm gonna be in a pain. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Jesus. Twelve, all three of five. Five, there's sixty in WCWM. You know, after the Reen sat on his, push, so to speak, and like a fart in his face, maybe that explains why he's making a sound. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. That a poor mom-mister. 567.560. 560. 560. On a A Elizabeth Smartphone. Let's hear it. Okay. Let's see some enthusiasm from the Sapphire audience, Little Elizabeth, who's as cute as a button man. She's beautiful. She's 15. She has survived nine months with these crazy people. These crazy religions to get our Paujaz for being redundant. How's that pull coming over? 700 votes. I'll tell you, there haven't a field day today. This is the kind of thing that every wacko out there in radio land just goes nuts on. 707 votes. We believe it. But we like it. We love it. Don't we love it, Carlos? Love it. Well, you're sure off your feed today. What happened? Eric, pick it on you again. We sold a stover. Okay. Don't even sit. If you haven't promised that Eric again, I want to be the last person. And don't forget also since I am such a hell of a guy. But even while be on vacation next week, that every day we're going to continue with these damn abit timesters on our website. Okay. Yeah. I mean, why not? I'm not saying I'm going to get up six o'clock in the morning to do it. But I'll get them to you when I feel like it. And we also have a change of uncertainty and something. We're going to put that misgrudge right away to help you. He's only got what a million hits a day. 1.0. Huh? We're catching up. Yeah, sure. Yeah, we're doing over 100,000 every day. I'll tell you that. What's he doing about 75 million an hour? But, sir. And here's the fact, it's just I was glad to hear last evening that Elizabeth Smart was found alive. She seems like a beautiful child. All right. It was nice to have all the experts wrong and they're thinking that Richard Reeves probably spelled wrong as it's Recy. RICCI had killed her before he died. They gave him a cerebral hemorrhage and his identity. So his wife, with the lawyer was under this morning and you could just see the look in their eyes man. They're just counting the cash register's reen-i-grey. And remember the young guy that was adrift in that they first accused and had the world of uniform for days. That's the guy that drove over two was a Virginia somewhere and he was in a check and something about not house. I think he got references from muff. And this guy never even worked at Q.I.M. The one, anyway, it says in glad she's home and saved, but I think there would be a lot more to the story to come out that he's ahead. The smart family seems a little shaky to me for some reason. Oh, I haven't heard anything like this. The fact that Elizabeth and our abductors were stopped twice to give them a different name. The fact that her sister after months figured out who the guy was when they were spotted, they were walking down the street. You would have thought that at some point you could have bolted. Yeah, but that's like St. Petty, her's good a bolted too. That's that's Stockholm syndrome. And there has to be some fuller connection to the story. We haven't heard yet like they hang out at Disney for a few. As a matter of fact, they did. Yeah, they just had a thing on it before. They made trips to Disney World and there was one other place. Maybe Vegas. So I don't know. I may be wrong. I'm not thinking, but I'm sure Larry King will figure it out. Oh yeah, they're going to have a panel. I'm sure they'll be having another panel. How do I panel tonight? We got a great panel. Oh God. It says, don't forget on Mo show, the guy with a voice does a traffic update about every ten minutes. Oh, that's right. I'm Mark Morgan. Oh, I hear that. If you could only hear how that sounds in here, you know, on the speakers here. Yeah. Because I have really good speakers. We hear it in here. But it comes on pre delay. Mm-hmm. On Mark Morgan. And I just about jump off the chair when that comes on. So he goes on for a couple of minutes. So if you ended up all of the different stuff they got under me to in the sports updates and the traffic updates and the spots and then guilty. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop with all of that. And take out the live spots also. What do you got left of a 45 seconds? And this guy's talking to me in addition to which what the hell difference is make how long I'm on over here. It was that cut to do with anything. You know, I'm taking a big check to the bank every two weeks. I think that's what this derbs him. Plus we got five billboards more and you got one. I don't know. You're like that. You silly old, cool with bad, very close veins at a dripping bag. You silly old man. What do you say to that? You silly, cool huh? Huh? Yeah, he had to happy about his what he's trying to say. Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty. Oh, we got Mickey Mouse and Eisner part three. Coming up in the next break too. Excellent. Oh, I'm telling you, we got some heavy duty stuff for whatever reason. This was the week that everybody just went nuts with good stuff. Must be the pre-war stuff, huh? Yeah. Where are we going? We're going to a beautiful Fort Lauderdale, hello. Hello, Neil? Yes, sir. Thank you for wonderful years of your talents on the radio. And the Christmas right. And have a quick question for you. Maybe you can tell us. Or maybe George can. Maybe George can do it. He's an expert. Right. I live in Sierra, religiously. But sometimes I miss like an hour or so of you show. And I go to your website to live into it on your archives. And last year when you could go to it, a player pops up and you could slide the slider if you missed the third hour, you can go to the third hour of the show. Now when I go to the website, I have to do so slider to get to here the full four hours of the show. And sometimes I hear Hank, a Hank's show on one of your archives of a certain day. Is there any way if I, the audio player comes up, they can hear like a third hour or the fourth hour, not the whole four hours. I have no answer. I'm wasting, I'm waiting for Carlos. I'm going to joke. But you know, later during the day, if you guys can go to the website and this pop up on the day, I see why I can't fast forward to another part of the show. I rather than sitting here and I'm playing dumb which we are, I'll find out for your account research. And talking about the smart case, the Mrs. smart was not so smart to give a drifter $5 in the bottom of the house and bring him into their family. I mean, I wouldn't go to $5.95 and bring one of these guys so me. Yeah, they seem to have a habit. I mean, I don't want to judge them in any way, but they seem to have a habit. I have an awful lot of a shini drifter scumbags hanging around the house. And to the answer, that archives may be later during the show or tomorrow may be you can come up with a day. I haven't known today, but I'll, if I can find out, I'll put it on for you tomorrow. Neil, thanks for a wonderful 20 years until. And have a great life. Thank you. 560, 0560, pound 570 divided in Europe deepening France and Germany dismissed the British proposals. I don't like that. Good. Did you hear what the German said to a Tony Blair? You understand? You just got both of them. That's what they said. And that was even before the story about Prince Charlie came out. Well, it was brits man. It got real problems. Those brits are going to have the schmits. And of course, that's nasty when you were in those kills. Wow. I think it'd be kind of handy. Here's Lake Worth, hello. Hey, what's up, Neil? Yes, sir. Hey, I want to talk about what I'm scared of. What do you scared of? I'm most scared of like the people I Richard Pearl and all those guys. I'm scared of the wind right. Scared of the wind. And I cried. Yeah, I'm scared of their most optimistic interpretation of the situation. I'm scared of that being correct. Yeah. And then what that'll do to the world. The old chicken hawks. Yeah, man. If they're right and we change it, you know, we put a new regime in there and they're waving American flags. And they're not going to stop. But I rack. They're going to see that as justification to go on to the whole rest of the world. You see, it's kind of like the duck tapes. I'm sure I was stupid. Most of the American public is this business about we're so concerned about the oppressed Iraqi people. It's just like seeing we were so concerned about the Afghanistan of the Afghan people after 9.11. We couldn't give a crap about them. One bit at all until we had to go back and get even with the Taliban and try to find a Osama, Yamama. We didn't give a crap about what they were doing. In fact, we were going to be business partners with them in the Afghan pipeline. So we could ship that oil again from Turkmenistan. But we didn't give a crap about the way they were pressing the people. So all of this bull crap, all of this flowery sonny grew to export democracy. It's a bunch of horse crap. We're not fooling anybody. Yeah, tell me about it. Well, thanks now. Take it easy. I'll see you under the bed. Oh, the poor Iraqi people. There are prestige that towered in a dictator. Oh, my God. Give me here to say to poor Russian people, is that interesting that when we managed to keep they thought going all those years, the Cold War finally ended in communism died of its own. It took its own demise. They got a natural death. And we managed to hold off Stalin and<|pt|> in all those busy bastards. But all those nuclear weapons in a humongous arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. Every kind of chemical weapon has ever been invented and then some Cuban missile crisis. They were right there right off the day. There you go. And we somehow managed to overt all of this psychosis. But it seems that our leaders that we got in there now, the old chicken hops, it seems they want to lead us in this direction of going to war with everybody. Can't do it. Virginia can't do it. Because if we're really going to go after all the people who are being oppressed, then we're going to have to go after Syria and Saudi Arabia and Iran and North Korea. And the list is almost endless. And then we'll take care of Fidel like on a weekend. Do you want to say? Sure. Leave her to eat power. Now you're talking. Now you're making sense. 12 minutes after noon at 5.60 WQ and we finally got the load on on barbecue's galore thighs to a duff who went down there, grabbed pity, lany by the neck and slug them a couple of times, which is a good idea. And finally got an answer for us because like all of our other side, I mean why should it be different? The rest of the sales department don't give a crap about the recount. So why should pity lany?

Oh, almost too much for one day, you know what? Yep. Now, who was it was if the Aztecs who worshiped the sun? Yes. That was their religion? Yes. I was thinking of myself during a while, listen to Mickey and Eisner. I was thinking that if I was to believe in anything, and I've said this before. I believe in the sun because number one, life can't survive without it. And number two, it's tangible and you can see it and you can feel it. And you can smell it, right? Right? They had other gods, but that was the main one. Was the sun? There were sun worshippers. And what's wrong with that? Like a lot of people on the beaches down there right now. They were shipping the sun. Let's play the warmth of the sun by the beach boys. No. Here's the fact from Tom and Vokus. The new moment is great.

We've discussed this before. Is it you or somebody else told me they don't like sandwiches that have like, dressing on it dressing. You know, like Russian dressing. Like a Rubin sandwich has Russian dressing without the Russian dressing. Right. Yeah, I think you're going to always do something. I would agree with you. I don't like when a bread gets soggy. You know, on the sandwich was sweet. That kind of dressing. Right. Plus I'm not supposed to be no bread anyway. Right. And I'm not here in DMT. I'm not. I am really. I've got to know.

So we had a really all messed up show. And I had to rely on the callers. The whole show on Monday. And I'm going to tell you something. By the end of my one o'clock, I was ready to blow my brains out. And I'm thinking of myself. What a difference between the people I speak to every day in South Florida.

And you talk about something he's on like about two minutes an hour. Give it try to listen to his show. No, I have not. This call is over her to his show. Yes.

I need it. You're mentioning the difference between the conversation to have people up there. Vures is down here. And it's just browsing around on the internet. I saw CBS News report that says that National Geographic Survey of American Younger I had a plan before about finding a rack on a matthale have a clue. 87% can find it even when you have show them a map. Yeah, even if you stick their finger on it. And you mentioned that you were firmly convinced that that with the duct tape, if the asker was going on. I mean, how could anybody be that stupid to buy into that? To, I mean, first of all, for them to present that to the public shows how done they assume most of us are and to talk down to us like we're a bunch of kindergarteners, it's just pathetic. And it is, you know, the so much duct tape is cropping up different aspects of duct tape stories of them cropping up like the leaky biosuits that our soldiers have to use at the base. Yeah. After the whole duct tape, and here's something from the Associated Press yesterday that, you know, this remotely controlled the air, piloted on piloted aircraft that the US has. Well, the, the Associated Press reports says here, a remotely piloted aircraft that the US has warned could spread chemical weapons is made of ball-fled wood and duct tape. Two small propellers attached to what looks like engines of a weed wacker. Excellent. You can find that on the Associated Press. How am I going to write now? Iraqi drone US warned looked like more like a model airplane. So here's the crap out of me duct tape is everywhere, Neil. Ever great. Hey, you have a great vacation. Thanks. 22 till one. Yeah, I hate to say because I want to sound un-American, but I don't really give a crap. It's just the people who are so much more educated and even though the teachers here always go on strike. They have a lot of the same problems, you know, underpaid people, etc. But the, the education level here is so much greater. I mean, you just don't find the rampant functional illiteracy that you do in American. That's because the school system in America is a joke. It's just, it's just like when jab ran for reelection. Oh, he's the education governor. And you know, they're taught. They found a tape that they tape that comment about subriding the world of public, which now, right now he's trying to get through the legislature to convince the people to say, oh, we didn't really mean it about the class size. Because it's got cost a lot of money. So we'll change your mind. This is the education governor. What about what are we talking about? It's always politically correct. Very much so to say, or number one priorities education, bull crap. You can't complain about the education of America because generally speaking, there isn't any value talking about. So why don't we get these stories a year after year, year after year, 87% can't find us. How about the ones the college students we had at three a few months ago? They couldn't find the place where they live. They couldn't find Florida on a map. Florida college students. The ones from New York couldn't find New York City on a map. They couldn't find New York State a whole bunch of them. And it wasn't like about 13% couldn't find the United States on the map. Okay. Are you ready for that? The same people that were ready to go out and buy the duct tape, it should be very impressed with the fact that 13% of the people, young people, couldn't find the USA on a map of the world. The... The... Figures on people. He invaded another country. He drank water from a creek. He's got a bad mustache. Oh. I am so glad to be here. Twenty-two-one at five-six-two. But you can't. I'm so glad also there. Good buddy, Chuck Alphiari still take care of guys out there with that big ugly. Ballspot. Create a... Very...

It should be held April 10, 13 Augusta, 145 miles west of Atlanta. The club which has now the female member in its 69 year history has defended its right to decide its own membership despite sharp criticism of the all male policy. First said she wanted to expose the golf clubs discrimination against women and he hypocrisy of its corporate members who say they support diversity in have not reviewed the no women policy. There you go. The coctor town continues to have the masters is the good old boys want to continue its our its a boys club. You know it's a thing boys will be boys and like hanging around with boys.

Hey, don't get smart with me. The Supreme Court yesterday stopped Texas from executing its 300 inmates. In capital punishment resumed in the US in 1977. Granting a dramatic last minute state to condemn killer Delma Banks. Thanks, thanks. He was wrong. We're convicted of murder 23 years ago and they were backed by three former federal judges. How do you like that? T. D. C. Well, Delma sounds like a woman doesn't it? His lawyer told Justice as he was poorly represented at the trial prosecutors improperly kept blacks off the jury and testimony from two prosecutors and witnesses was shaky. Banks's black is victim was white and the jury was you guessed it all white. Are you like that in Texas? How? He's been on death for 22 years. Longer than 16 year old Richard Whitehead the victim was alive. The court issued the stay without comment about 10 minutes before his booth put to death. Boy, you talk about a last minute reprieve. 10 minutes. Can you imagine a. Wow. Woo. I'm not so sure if that would happen before. After the word came in. What do you mean? I'm saying I'm not so sure if the judge had in the pants would have been before they reprieve or after they found out. You know, probably just a psychotic episode. Wouldn't you think?

I rack as a weapon of mass destruction. Only a rack as a weapon of mass destruction. Bye bye bye. Thank you for watching. Good luck this instant.
