And that would ease up Sadavanski that done His legal team also claimed that living with Michael Jackson And Britain on Monday was an infringement of his privacy The program of course was on last

behavior with children Yeah It's said that shows voiceovers questions and editing gave Credence to allegations made against him in 1993 of a sexual offense against the child Yeah In the complaint file with the broadcasting standards Commission Jackson said he was not given any prior warning of the Narrators intent to interview him about the 93 incident Or to question the legality of his correlation

planted in your brain George was doing that this morning And this is the way the public operates You're like a bunch of sheep That's a bunch of crap Okay so we grew up in an abusive family with a miserable father That's not an excuse for it The guy's 40 years old The guy's 44 years old This business of body never had a child And he's doing it now Well I agree That's not an excuse He's been using that line Ever since the LaToya whipped out that first cancel check For two three million dollars from that difference It's been a reason It's not an excuse It had to have led to part of what is

it's the priest or whether it's him or whoever it is They have to be put in some kind of a Lack box My partner's Ireland way out there They didn't let out There's no cure Not let out because we

What's your favorite TV information and I realize that may sound like a freaky question But the fact of the matter is there are freaky people like me and Carlos and here who actually find Informersials entertaining do you know that if it's really disparate like how do we can? And I see just looks like when a godfather comes on and you can't turn it off and you watch it even though you've seen a hundred times Same with it like the one poopy all show time the rotisserie oven Right am I right? Can't turn it off. Okay, I especially like the part where he takes the hammer and slander and you oh Yeah, they're all gonna like that now even those people are all getting paid off Which is likely or they're all getting the free rotisserie oven, which is also likely or they're all on magic mushrooms, which is most likely They get paid and lunch. Oh free lunch. I knew a man can you imagine a farm would start taping those information Down here like a cemetery village dick find or get pop at a park and turn them on how if he gave my free spaghetti dinner Those people would all get up and start ah, so great this adventure even though Edison would be proud They'd be following it tomorrow if we're not going to each other down to get to the free food and make their statements Of sure there are more people like you and Carlos Oh well if they weren't they wouldn't be putting those damn things on there and I confess I did buy the juicy man See back in the days of early satellite TV when I had my first dish back 16 years ago There used to be I mean the stuff I'm now doesn't come close to those things. There used to be really great Informersials that would go on forever and I bought my first vitamin sub blender was like a steel I remember that yeah Vitamix through a thing to an information it was okay. I was just about a month or two and then I shmipped candid I actually never throw them out. They are all wide up in the kitchen cupboards, you know And then of course I bought the juicy man's juicer broke the second time I used it And then and I started and I did work wrong big bushy eyebrows after I used that from the juicy man. What's his name? I can almost think of his name Jay Jay Courditch Courditch That's his name Jay Courditch I think the juicy man who's actually only 25 but looks 116 because he's been juicing it too much You got those days of stuff. I just told you what it is. It's say Courditch or Courditch got damn Carlos that quick picking on George Although he can't do anything for it In fact it be honest with you. I think so where we get luck for I don't think anybody can do anything. Oh that was difficult That was hey I did my best. You're for crap get some stuff from Tony's near we have bug Brad in a long time Although what time do they open they don't want to know if they don't know for an early hours keep calling until they do open Now we want that stuff in here early so we need all through the show today. We ought to do a pull on at some time What are you laughing about well if you audiences doesn't like it if it's resounding enough will stop beating on here Well, we no plus when I'm not here.

This is disturbing from the Brit paper the Guardian this morning Somebody facts this to me. Thank you so much. UK war dossier sham say experts British intelligence lifted from academic circles Articles rather down the street was last night plunged in an acute international investment after it emerged at large parts of the British government's latest dossier on Iraq Allegedly based on intelligence material were taken from public academic article some of them several years old A midcharges of scandalous plagiarism on the night when Tony Blair attempted to rally support for the US Lead campaign against Adam Hussein light halls dismay was compounded by the knowledge that the disputed document was single out for praise by the West Secretary of State Colen Paul and his speech the one security council on Wednesday citing the British dossier entitled a rackets infrastructure concealment deception and intimidation in front of a worldwide A television audience Mr. Paul said I would call my colleagues attention to fine paper that the United Kingdom distributed which describes an Exquisit's a tale Iraqi deception activities, but on channel four news That's how it was revealed that four of the reports 19 pages have been copied with only minor editing and a few insertions from the internet version of an article by Abraham Al Marashi which appeared in the Middle East review of international affairs last September How do you like that? I'm not gonna read the whole thing, but in fact we probably ought to put this on the website Curluses happen right on it, but it just so much crap going on, you know what we'll get to our poll eventually But there's a lot of crap for example speaking of pedophiles a Georgia priest has been given 10 years in prison A 10 year prison sense for sexually abusing two Montgomery County brothers in the early 1970s. This in Rockville, Maryland Wayland Brown apologized to his victims during a sentencing yesterday saying he wished there was something to do to ease their pain He had already played a guilty abuse which took place while he was studying at a Washington Seminary Brown later became a priest in Savannah But it hasn't worked in the church since 88 one of the brothers testified at Brown's hearing in Rockville yesterday that the abuse had ruined his life and made him consider suicide An Oklahoma man testified that Brown also abused him during the 70s while he was a boy in Georgia the man said Brown took him to Walt Disney World and made sexual advances to him during the trip just another isolated incident Or so many of these things, you know it nuclear bomb hoax From yellowtimes.com.org In a speech in front of the U.S. Security Council February 53,0003 colon piled did not offer any viable new evidence concerning a max nuclear weapon capability that Bush and his entourage continued to wave as a red flag in front of the eyes of the American people to Insight them shamefully into one unjust war on the contrary The few flimsy so-called pieces of evidence that were presented by Paul regarding his supposed continued to wreck a nuclear weapon program Servo need a weak in the American British accusations and reveal their untenable attempt to cover with a fig leaf their thread Where arguments a misinformation campaign the false and unthrough piece of evidence follow when it goes out for example Powell and a theoretical query asked why the Iraqi scientist were asked to sign declarations with the death penalty found adhered to not to reveal their secrets to the IAEA Inspection teams exactly the opposite is true the four or five is every call such declarations Which are written to tale held us to the penalty of death in the event that we did not hand in all the sensitive documents and reports that may still be in our possession This is written by a former Iraqi nuclear scientist Iman Kuduri had Paul's intelligence services provided him with a copy of these declarations and not to put it on the factors testimonies Who are solely motivated by the sub promotion in the eyes of their beholders and avail themselves to a good Arabic translation with his declarations exactly said He would not had he had any sense been abiding by the truth Manchin this is evidence Edico's also put this one on there too, okay. I want to overwork in her Carlos, but there's some pretty damn good stuff and obviously I don't want to sit here and read the whole thing because the public's convinced out there anyway They bought it lock stock in viral right and the fact that the polls say yada yada Whatever the poll say that's what it's all about we're gonna go in here and kick some ass baby. I would say this though This from MSNBC's website the state department warned Americans abroad yesterday of the threat of new terrorist attacks using chemical or biological weapons The world-wide alert came as US security official told NBC news that they were considering raising their assessment of the threat of terrorist attacks Two are you ready for this orange It's second highest level setting intelligence indications for plans of a major attack as early as next week The threat assessment has been at the third or five levels yellow were elevated since September 24 The assessment was last at orange or a high for two weeks beginning September 10 They'd be for the first anniversary of nine eleven attacks in New York or Washington, DC US officials had at the time the two captured members of Osama bin Lanzel Katernett worked had told interrogators of specific plans to carry out new attacks Homeland security department official told NBC news pit Williams yesterday that the level of concern was out at high since the nine level of attacks administration officials said they were reassessing the threat level one day at a time as the US moved closer to taking military action against Sodom who saying which critics contend with an inflame US sentiment among Muslims worldwide Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld dismissed talk that new attacks could be ties specifically to Washington Iraq It doesn't take an attack on Iraq to one nation attack a terrorist attack on the US They've already done it Rumsfeld said what do you think nine eleven was but But a senior Bush administration official told NBC news that US intelligence had been intercepting a steadily rising number of conversations Among suspected members and sympathizers of al-Qaeda The new intelligence some watch was described as very general suggested that the possibility of attacks around the world was higher now Another concern is the arrival next week of HHA J The week long period each year when observant Muslims make a pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca and Saudi Arabia US officials said the official told NBC news that intelligence had picked up discussions of possible attacks around the Hodge While other official said extremists could be motivated by renewed religious server to launch more tax. I just mentioned that in passing Cuz we're not gonna change anybody's mind and Dustin Hoffman blasted to administration over Iraq what the hell does he know? I Don't know he's a very good driver Excellent to Oscar winner Double Oscar winner Dustin Hoffman accuses President George W. Bush administration of manipulating the grief of the country post nine eleven When backing for possible over the rack Hoffman speaking as he picked up the lifetime achievement prize at the Empire magazine film awards in central London Added that he believed America's motives are going to work included power and oil Huh for me is an American the most painful aspect of this is that I believe the administration has taken the events of 911 and many related the grief of the country.

I guess that's if you're going to do one of those juices the idea is to take these real old guys And look at this. I'm still alive because I'm the juicy man. I'm drinking all those juice I'm I'm busy juice and all day long. I'm squeezing it But the fact that a matter like he says is who would one look like that?

It's like Fagra light or Viagra and tensor whatever Ron Jeremy hey one day you can look just as good as Ron and maybe you can be double-jointed too But I doubt it you can be a human furball like Ron remember that day that he was in here I'm okay and the way that some of the people in this building are hearing I know I mean why I don't know why I don't know I don't get it. I don't understand it Maybe they got this and a Peter North was in a building maybe a few years ago before it got to be 90 or if like Bambi woods or one of those people's in the building, but Ron's very hog oh and when I told him that right to his ugly pussy He got he was actually legitimately offended he was offended. I'm fat. Yeah, you're fat and We like Julio and you're Julio a lot is a great guy, but he's a fat tub He's not pleasingly pomp his a fat tub.

Yeah, I know what's going on in here. Yeah, good, awesome idea. What's your back? I can play your own way, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though, though. Those are the ones. I got another thing about on top I get in right there, and I don't need a rating that's a minor, safe. Yeah, I can do it on there to send this to a guy, a white little heart, a russian gunster girl. And a lot of fat pretuses, you know. That's right, but you're back. When you want to wake a mow, no mow, no mow, no mow, no mow, no mow, no mow, no mow, no mow. But you're back, that's what you want. Wait for mow, no mow, no mow. Oh, brother, all that blah-blah-blah, I don't understand. You can eat from a truck while you're in both hands. If it's that time you made a rating small, you just might click and it's all your fault.

W.K. Geldy, the good show this morning, Mo was out his dog, I guess his sick or something. And the guilty was on there alone, did a pretty interesting show. All that beat. Had a very great ambiance here this morning, and O'Reilly's clearance wasn't here monitoring the show, was a pretty interesting. Paul says, don't forget to flow me here cutting system. All we didn't probably just mention that like about 10 seconds ago. He probably won't paint too much attention. David Vokus says, how about the information running out for the pasta cooker? Yeah, this is heavy duty now. It's all over the place. The pan with the holes in the, that you turn the lid and it locks in place. So you go for the water out, scettied out the side. It says this one's funny because they have these retards pouring water for regular pans and done with spiyat in the sink like idiots. They show all these clumsy assholes splattering and burning and poaching and oysterring gut for bitches should use a colander. A colander. They actually have such a thing. And David Vokus says they're stupid. Yeah, is it really that hard to drink? Drain spaghetti? I don't think so. David Vokus at the end of his faxes is. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Pretty soon. Here's what it says is Ms. Cleo the psychic can sit in in from our show. You bet. It sure was. Gotta get Ms. Cleo on there, even though it may not. It does not to be one to son right now. And another good one. The blue blockers sung glasses with a fat wrapper. The blue blockers. The blue blockers. Don't we have a bit on that? The blue. We have something somewhere. A blue blocker bit. Also the snack master. Now that's what is that? Oh, yeah, that's the one where you like that would be perfect for me for my grilled cheese sandwiches. Oh, that's triangular. Yeah. Cooker thing. That's right. That's been a long time. We have a good memory for that. That was a pretty good thing. It looked like the grilled part of it was like a grill off a line. Like a portable waffle iron. And you just unfold it over. So it might like grilled cheese sandwiches on there or whatever. Is that the name of it snack master? Very good. Thank you so much. Also, Country Western's 160 greatest hits. If you imagine how much picking and green you could do 160 greatest hits, you could pick until your brain bled. I mean, you don't have to put these on or this is certainly the snack master probably does. In addition to which most of the people hate these all anyway, which is why we ought to be doing this. We're asking today what's your favorite TV informational. Assume, I mean, we could ask which one do you hate the most, or is the most annoying? But we don't want to be so negative, do we? It always accused me of being negative right. I try to be a little positive. And I still think that a lot of them are very entertaining, especially compared to so much of the crap that's on round the clock. Crap. Turn on the cable crap. You turn on satellite number one, more crap. Satellite two. I mean, you can smell it. Like you're like your TV set ought to be sitting on a septic tank. It's surrounded by so much crap. So you get it. But information on a saying this is a pretty interesting. They could be playing along. I'm playing along. I don't watch these things. Right. But I mean, you don't watch the thongs, the butt lifted one. Right. That's what they watch. I hate all Informerials 90. Girls gone wild videos, 44. Ron Fobiel, Showtime versus Rebarg. Barbecue 13, Lucky 13 for Ron. I'd love to hear from somebody who's got one of those. Everybody says those are really good. Not that I want one. What am I going to do with it? I have no need for one. I'm going to do it. I could, I guess. Does it fold down that small? Ron Fobiel pocket fisherman 11. Never saw one seven seven people. By the way, has Gilbert doing any Raspberry today? Not yet. We're on to you Gilbert. We're on to you. And I'm going to tell you right now. We're going to set a look at Brassie, Fat Rich, and Dave the cop to your house to beat the crap body. If you don't cut it out. We're on to you. Yeah. And the other one that he does is that we can't share that we can't see on the earring. Figures. Figures that somebody like you with those stick glasses who just has no life whatsoever needs constant never ending attention would be the one it's like constantly and certainly bugging a crap out of the people on the phone ear. Yeah. Back to you. Like it'll stuff by the way. Really? Ron the clock. Ron the clock. Ron the clock. Thank God. And John Marquish. He's like help. I love them. Eddie K. Everybody. And that's your fault. You do understand. Oh yeah. I want to talk to Gilbert. Come on, Gilbert. Everything is okay. Don and Mike. Blow. Shmuck. Here's a lady in sunrise. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, man. I heard something that was disturbing from seeing a news. Yeah. They want to have a portable creamatorium through the military. Yeah, that's on our website. We put that to you. I'm sorry. That's okay. I have the past of perfect and it works for all foods that you have to boil and hot water. It works excellent. I like it. It's a calendar. It doesn't get to job them. Oh, I guess there are other things you could boil. It wouldn't be like working a calendar so good. Yeah, you get two sizes of the small and medium, but it does work. I think it's probably over price though. How much was it? Mine was like $29. Ah! What did you know? I got one. I guarantee one of those plastic calendars, which I have one at home. I have one of my apartment in Toronto. I have one even in Amsterdam. They probably cost like about $1.98. Yeah, I have those two, but you got a cheese grater with it. Oh, if I knew that. I'll get two. Thanks a lot. It sounds really great. See, I mean, look, those things wouldn't be on there unless suckers like us were by them hand over fist, okay? They're on there because it's on television. And no matter how much we know we're getting con, it's like all these people with their newsletters. The financial newsletter. Right. Even Dr. Bob Arnett, who is now no longer a doctor, Bob, and now an international expert on everything from aviation to world affairs, he had a newsletter. On health. It was crap. Not that these people would exploit the fact that they're on television for fun and profit to try to suck the blood money out of all of a suckers out there, but they do. They do. I wish I could think of that Steve Garvey one. Because that really fries my ass. I wonder showing all these people shoveling. You know what? Look like what? What the hell is that, the R.E.M. song? Give me hints. So the most recent, the big hit they had last year that I was playing all the time. Were they at the right religion? No, I don't think that was last year losing my religion. That is wrong with his man. I mean, this man again. But anyway, they're all sitting there and they're happy people. They're forget about it. But it reminds me, and all these people are sitting around there and out there are barbecue and there's shove it all this big, thick juicy cheese burgers with big buns and fries, greasy fries. And you can eat all of these things and watch the pounds pour off your body. And there is Steve Garvey, one of the most boring people on the face of the earth. It's not like the turbo cooker. Is it? The air cooking thing? They're pills. It goes away. What is the turbo cooker that's going to do with losing weight? French fries, you mentioned French fries. Now, the idea is that you can eat all these things and still lose weight by popping these pills. And then the other pill is the exercise in the bottle. For those of you who are too lazy next time. And that's it. And former. Did somebody call with that or do you? He felt it up. The informer. Oh, yeah. I want to inform you that those people are mostly in jail at this point. And then Tom Bosley was on one where he was peddling some crap, but I remember what it was. He there's like a ten minute disclaimer in the beginning, but well, he's got to protect his reputation and you know him from happy days and you know how he wouldn't endorse anything unless it was really the MS and then he goes on to some scam. I don't know what it is. Some crap. Somebody will know what that was. Tom Bosley, who annoyed me to begin with. And I hate to say it. I never liked that show anyway. Am I the only one? Happy days? Yeah, he was horrible. I hated that show. Hey. I liked it when Scott Bayoke him on. I never let Scott's a man old fag. You know, I like looking at him, but he didn't like Fanzi. No, Fanzi, are you kidding me? Or yours. I wouldn't wipe my ass with his face. And he's wrecked. Of course, now he's a great director. You know Ron Howard is not Ron Howard. He's a brilliant director and he's a right. Maybe he is. I don't know. Good enough for John Stockwell. I like to shake John Stockwell's hand just once. He's an old man. I was like 40 something. Ancient. Do you know who that is? Grissel. I talked about a million times. He was a, I know who he is. A fine young man. It's 24 up now. He's probably a fine old man. Like some of us were getting pretty old. Yes. In fact, I'm almost ready for my young and checkered pants. I heard most say that a couple days ago. I almost drove off the road. And then I loved a one. Geldy said, what do you mean I'm most? Nice going. Geldy, Geldy's pushing up a little bit. I guess he wants Jugg's job extra bad now.

Get anybody nervous that Tara Thread is being raised to orange today? It's Friday, you bastard. Coming up tonight on Inside the Behind the True Hollywood Celebrity Music Bargher Profile Story. We take a good, hard, stiff looking to start up. Finding out the sweet girl you had a crush on in high school has posed naked and playboy might be a little traumatic. But what man wouldn't want to simply get over it and bang her anyway? Certainly not. The J.Giles band. Like you, you're the center post. Enjoy the set of gold. Listen man, it was Hosh. I used to see that girl every day in home room. I thought she would be pure, perfect forever. You just don't picture an angel, but an aheimen. No, what I mean? J.Giles leads in your petal world who suffers from a classic Madonna horror complex, according to psychologist Helen Kilimann. With Madonna Horror Complex, the woman is a saintly, virginal beauty, or she is. A filthy horror! The man desires both. A can only make love to the filthy horror! Unless of course the filthy horror is Madonna herself. Of course. Oh, it got bad for Peter, man. He would just stare at that cennifold all day and his eyes would tear up. The band's manager, sloppy gold, describes the horrible day that Peter will turn up the name emergency room. Finally he couldn't help himself. He gets naked, lays out the magazine's cennifold and well let's just say that's how that old story got started by getting it caught on a staple. Peter will himself remember that day. After several botched, we constructed surgeries, Peter will put aside his fears of seeing his old high school crush with her clothes off and made a date, arranging to take her to a motel room and take him off in private. So my sweet angel was a dirty horror after all. Hey now that I can home! The J.Giles band retrograde male bullf**ks in 1982. It's a big juicy, shopping-wet-look at show business tonight on Inside the Mine. 1047-560W here on the Terror Threats being raised to a orange today. Beginning of the show we told you that they were thinking about it and now they're going to do it. Are they telling us why anything specific? No, they never do that. But it's high. I'll start getting more nerves. Here's a facts about Jeff Rummer. From George in Montreal, who says listening online in Montreal, go to Florida every winter a yuck it says. Ask Rummer about Pete Rose, ask him about how Pete Rose bitch slapped Rummer in the Xbox 1984. Yeah. And it's very, and I'm going to save this. So I just remember about this. Next time we have free meals at the pizza loft. Rummer was just isn't oiling in Montreal. He's in Florida today. He says George from Montreal. How do you like it? George is laughing real hard, Rummer. I wonder he hates you like boy. Oh, it's some Pete a card. If it's free, it's me. Now that's why. I wonder if he was a freeloader in Montreal. Wow. Yeah, this is a new thing. The silly thing to ask. Steve Garvey discusses being sued for informational selling weight loss system. And here's our good friend. This is about 85 pages that are not so good friend Dave Jeff Heiz neighbor, Sammy, but all interview about Steve Garvey. Thanks very much for wasting our time, Dave. I don't sure your intentions were good. How you doing, Ira? Nice to see you. And I know that's gotten coming. Now wonder what's such a good day. Yeah. Oh, he's probably guarding the place because we got that orange alert now. Don't anybody get nervous now? We've been on orange alert before and the work this still spit it around. Look about how difficult was it going to be to come from orange back down to yellow. And now how difficult is that going to be? How are we going to survive with this? What level of history are we supposed to? I wish they would tell us just how hysterically we need to be. And how many hours per day we have to hide under the bed? I think we should be hysterical enough to go home. Okay. Well, right after lunch, I was at the editing. I'm having an exciting time. Right after eating the free food from Atlantic City, so to the other weeks, where I were mixed at difference, we could take a bag lunch home. Yeah, we could take a sack home. What's your favorite TV information we're asking today? And I guess the Michael Jackson thing last night, I'll show many, many people's so it. What is there to say besides George and Joe Custell are defending him? On the grounds that he was confused and abused and keep on it. You said it. I wasn't defending him. Why do you keep your rationalizing his average life? I think they would be heavy. They would stay. And I think they know every move that they're making from hanging it, kid over to balcony. Then there was a thing. I said it was the publicity. And yet now just watching it look at it resolved. CD and record sales are booming now. That's just in Britain, but about the rationalizing. Vignan subdaughters worth of fee publicity. He's been doing it for years now for decades. Just like Madonna. Every slutty thing she does, the media hops on it and the story too. I don't think she's a crazy person. Well, she's harsh. He's an crazy boy. Do you know it's a good thing to do this thing about TV information? Because television is the greatest conduit, if I can say that, for pedaling crap, bullshit to the public. Take a look at what's going on with his subwarmer about to embark on. Why, what a great salesman job they did. They put the number one salesman in the government, colon, poll on there. And he's a very credible guy and would never steal a freight train. Everybody said, look at that. Look at that tube. He'd steal a freight train. Look at that conversation. That's not a mess. And now he's got everybody in the Democrats all rolled over like Domino's, a domino park. And that's the end of that. We're going in. And I don't mind going in if everything goes according to oil. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's all I've had. The question that it would be really nice if we could eliminate him. Although, be nice if we didn't have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to do it. That would be even nicer to eliminate one man in his immediate his son and a few others. Oh, yeah, can't do it. I got news for you. Why don't we get some practice. And the next couple of weeks, why don't we just get rid of Castro and his brother, Raul? That's a kind of a dress rehearsal. As if he'd rest your rehearsal would be good. Are we going to do that? No. He doesn't have any oil. He doesn't have skated. He doesn't have weapons of mass destruction. He hasn't terrorized his people. He hasn't imprisoned those people who are cared to dissent. He has free and open election. That's right. Isn't that true? That's right. I mean, come on. But it's so easy. And North Korea is not dangerous. A specific notion of when, where, how. But you have to add the extra expense of all the precautions that employers and event stagers do. Yeah. Again, real nervous now, orange alert. Anyway, what's your favorite TV and commercial I hate all informers? So is 113 or 2.3% said. How many votes we got? Well, most of these don't have any yet. 262 votes is all we got. But then again, there's so many on here. Girls got a wild video. 53. I grab one of those right now. I'll give you a head of a guy's out there. Ron Popeel, Showtime, or Tissory, Barbecue, 15. Ron Popeel, Pocket Fisherman, 14. Did we put the vijamatic on there? Good. So, one, seven. Suzanne Sauer's blue thing, a five thing, the five asked you seven. George Forman, lean, lean, grill, machine five. You gotta be, I gotta say one thing. Even if you don't care about boxing, which I don't. George Forman's an eat guy. I like to hit. He's funny. He don't take himself real serious. And he made a fortune. Showtime that lean, lean, grill, and machine. Tony Robbins for the both legs for solo flex 3. Probably fags. Like me. That's what I voted for. Colton Sheets Real Estate Systems 3.

Which you just kind of like put your hands in it and squish it around a little bit. That's super blue stuff. Kind of like erotic. Five, six. Why are you interrupting there? I was, why is he poshking with a food in there? Are you poshking with his a scared to go in there while you're talking? Why is that? I don't know. When there's food in there, don't be scared to come in. Never played six or seven. Get your priorities straight enough. Just the number one thing in here, we said good right. We're going to come and tell Monday. He's getting free food. Okay. Now we got two of them. They can do a pro. Exactly. Miguel can do it. I brought him a little party. He's taking it since the least he could do. Get that plastic. It's here, why are they really? Here's Hollywood. Hello. Yes sir. How you doing, Guy? Pretty guy.

Yeah, Daddy Pope Hill was one coat. I'm really at that line for Bill Stetterman coat. I don't know what I thought. I don't know what I thought. I don't know what I thought. The Irish and Netcracker are they record back? Yeah. Also, if you want some stuff that's good, that I actually purchased the food saver is excellent. That thing really works back in the scene. Right.

You can use stainless steel tools on it. I bought those things two years ago. You can't wear them out. Excellent. I tell you what, it sounds like you're a full timer. I might get a job and want it. Okay, give us a cut. Thanks a lot. I mentioned the herbal life. He's still dead. What's his name? The guy with a big head of hair. herbal life. Steve something very good. He's still dead. Look at this. Muffins came in. Now he's not even going to lunch right now. And probably we'll have to go to lunch. Now that we got all this great food in here. He's your got a nose for a lunch, don't he? That was one of the other I mentioned during the break. Just looked on by. They're so damn many. Orange alert by the way, Duff. I don't want to get your nervous orange alert. High alert, baby. So I would say. Is it on? Turn it orange alert. That's why I heard. I mean, if it's good enough for power 96 to send everybody home just out of, you know, in morning. But we go into a very good. I think you and she's in everybody home at 11 o'clock. We're willing to go through one more break and put a tape on and put a tape on and go home at all because we're under orange alert. I have to go put the shutter.

No kids coming to the boys have a suit with your wedding wedding. You want to stay. I put that on the window, several of you can eat. See you's the big house on the feet on the pearls. And she finds someone to cook a hand. But she finds things to do when she'll be a male. People too little god. I hate this heart of things. I just pissed it by the guy's eyes. I hate this day.

So anyway, Tom Rage and John Ascroff are going to be speaking in one of our clunk today. Do you get to be buddy? You nervous for the weekend? Size Burling in his hair club for man. I'm not only the president of the former climber, then he says that. Remember? He's a member. Size Burling's hair club for man. That's when I was trying to think about him. How long with the herbal life? Guys dead. A lot of drugs. Young guy. Multimillionaires scam. A pyramid scam. Yeah. Back in those days, there were a whole bunch of those. None of them come to mind at the moment. There were a whole bunch of those things. And why? And why, obviously? Exactly. Exactly. Vitamin's, right? Right. Vitamines? Don't forget. It's the products. He had a certain way of saying that. That was so goddamn annoying. He wanted to smash him in a mouth. The proner. That's exactly how he said it. I said it. I said it. I said it. How many people hate all informers? They wouldn't watch it if you paid him by the second. Girls got in my video, 61. Juan Popiel Showtime or Tissue Barbecue 17. The pocket fisherman 14 times, I was to rate. But anyway, speaking to that, where's my f- I got so much stuff here. Wait a year, this story by the way, from Reuters. Oh, I shouldn't be reading because the one guy get upset. I don't give a crap. And a tag-in court has ruled that taking 40 joints of head-sheet on a school trip is not a crime. The marijuana was for personal use since the 17 year old student plan to share with two fellow students at a teacher. The appeals court judge said, this is for moorators. Under a tight-in law, selling marijuana is a crime of possession for personal use is not. Bye. It could easily have been consumed during the many days of the trip. Career a delaceta quoted the court ruling saying, Codieda delaceta, the evening career, evening news. Codieda delaceta, bonuseta, bonuseta. Love that a tight-in baby. I'm going back to Italy right now, where I'll be safe. And run me. I have to go right now. It's some personal protection I'm going to sit to you to Palermo. Where is that fact or here it is from Matrice, you says? I absolutely love my Ron Popiel Showtime or Tissue. I got one as a wedding gift two years ago, it's very easy to use and cooks meat perfectly. It'll make your meat perfect. You just said it and forget it like the information says. You just said it and forget it. I love those crowds on those infermursals. Now is it loud? You're the age of most of the people in those audiences. Death plus 10. I'm telling you Ron, Howlendale, sunrise lakes, surfside. Oh, come on down here and tape some infermursals here, Ron. We'll have your perfect audience. You mentioned they're going to get something for free. They'll say any crap you want. So a sudden forget it like the information says being primarily vegetarian. I knew nothing about cooking meat for my highly-carnival family. It has saved my ass many times, Tracy said. And, fact, he's probably even slucker ass in a couple of times. Just to be damn sure. Nice going, Tracy. Here's an interesting fact, George. From Chris. Howlbath, a very Christian, Mr. Ego, erection injection. He claims it will only work on head of a sexualse. Also, Gilbert sucks Steve's ass at least twice per week, and all he can talk about on Steve's show is you. Thanks, Chris. Well, I guess Chris is the one who's listening to that show. The one that don't show up in the numbers at all. On a station that basically doesn't exist. So, at least Gilbert is found a roosting place. Thank God for that other than in between book. On our station here. This is the amazing Gilbert. But we mighting you not to drink and drive this holiday season. Yeah, like on poor, I might drop your home in touch. When is poor, by the way? Always ask you that, and you never have an answer. That's because it's not on this calendar. It's a Goisha calendar. Oh, there should know them. Here's one that said, Joe, just cut my TV and have with my Ginsu knives. But wait, there's more. And you want a great line, Joe. They always say that. But wait, there's more. If that didn't get you to be a sucker and make the call. But wait, there's more. I also took up all my house tiles that would make into a spatula. I had my credit card ready, questioned Mark. It lost my ass. So, Joe. Only 72 easy payments of 89.99. Yeah, the new Ron Popeye'll show time is over $100. Only 4 easy payments. Only 5 easy payments of 1999. So, it's like 4 cents less, 5 cents less, that's 100 bucks. And he tells you the price. Oh, like somebody just brought out a magic wand in the fountain of youth. Oh, like that. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha. Hi, Ali. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Oh, hey, how's it going? Great. I'm really, really, I'm beyond nervous now with the, uh, the higher lyrids. Anyway, I have to go. I want you to be very nervous. I am. I am extremely. I don't know what to do this weekend. Under the bad man. Exactly. That's where I'm going to go right now. Take somebody good with it. And hi, Renee. Now that facts took my thunder. I was going to mention one of the original, in from the original, it's against the nice. Mm-hmm. Remember, I love that, uh, when they cut the, the slice like the tomatoes and then they went ahead and cut some sheet metal with the same knife. Mm-hmm. That was incredible. Oh, well, somebody took the thunder away. I think sheet was the operative word. Yeah. Have a great weekend. Under the bed. Okay. Bye, bye, bye. Under the bed folks. Uh-oh. But for a wide range of important tasks. From mitting in the shroom of the elsewhere, and a treasury secretary John Snow. Through place that Paul O'Neill geek that they had to blow out of there. It's the swearing in. You know what he said? Yeah, it's the swearing in. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T. And Verizon Wireless Line. And George made a good point during the break, which is very rare today since he's busy defending Michael Jackson. Well, but the fact that the entire world now knows since we've made it very, very clear that even Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles can see that we're going to go to war no matter what anybody says or what, oh, oh, I don't even think. Maybe that just is a coincidence, but it could be since we're going to orange level alert today. Huh? Could be just a coincidence. We made it very clear that we are, uh, adamant and, uh, whatever. So you're always reading things into it. Here's Miramar, hello. Miramar. Leo. Yes sir. It's not, uh, Billy Maysler. It's not the other one. What is? The orange alert. It's Billy Maysler. Oh. Anyway, I got the church to home. I'm a little slow, can I get you? Very good. I got that, uh, you know, something wouldn't that be great. Billy Mays comes on TV just before the press conference starts this afternoon. And it's a really amazing alert. And there he is. He could pedal with that loud hysterical voice of his. Oh, right. Get everybody panicky. Yeah, go ahead. Anyway, I got that show time. That's the Avabot man. Really? Yes. I cooked at least six seven prime ribs on here. They come about four five pounds. And I'll tell you, well, I'll never go to Ruth Chris again. Really? Yes sir. I'll be damned. It's orgasm. I think I'm going to get one. It's orgasm. Okay. Thanks. Anyway, two more. I could there's a quick and bright jam here, down on. Sure. And the steam buggy. That sounds familiar. What is that? It's the time you put the water in it and it takes the cleanser bathrooms, cleanses, cleanses, cleanses, cleanses, cleanses all the scum. Oh, it's not our thing. We got it on there. Okay. Thanks a lot. And another one. If you get to show time, make sure you get the one with a 15-bound turkey because the small one ain't worth a crap. Okay. Enjoy your meat. Have a good weekend. Thanks. You too. The steam buggy. Mm-hmm. Was good lunch. Thanks a lot, Ira. Elantic City subs were our mixed citizens in Hollywood. They're really great. And Scott did not come by. Boy, do we appreciate that? Did he make any comment? Scott, not around? That's the beautiful thing about Ira. He's a smile. He just smiles. He's in the food. Nothing to say. Nothing pays his shame. Good to see you. Good guy. Not a troublemaker. Not a yenta. Not a connoisseur. Not any of that crap. You know, that phony, uh, ditto. It wasn't asking for any free plugs. She's got the need to come by because we already gave them the free plugs for the Super Bowl party, uh, party you have platters. Right? Say that five times. I still can't believe that he turned around and came back in here that day. Had the Hutspa to come back in and I gave him the plug. I mean, I'm easy. You know, for free food. Wait, does he have a lot of Hutspa. Yeah, sure does. So when you go into what L.A. City subs in Ira, he'll be the ball. He had a guy with a real big smile on his face. Say, boy, you really work with that asshole Scott. Boy, he'll just smile. He'll just smile. He's he's the one. What else is he going to do? You know, he's got years of practice, I guess.

You have to start that on Tuesday on this show, because Monday's payday. That'll be a bit idea for a couple of weeks. Anyway, here's the fact that it says, here's a few more infermertials you may remember. In the early 90s, you're late 80s, the two clowns, one with a sickening English accent and a jerk with a glass of selling car wax products that suck. Yeah, the English accent thing is very, very big. Or Australian. Also in case you haven't mentioned the spray on here was a class. Yes, we did. All my love Arnold, PSF, you George. Haha, that catcher. Oh, he's sticking about you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Orange alert. I just mentioned that in passing. We're raising from the elbow up to orange. Yeah, I'm just thinking I'm supposed to adjust myself to that. I think we're supposed to go home right now. That didn't look too happy about that when you send that. He looked a little bit nervous. We've got to secure the house. Here's a lady in Highly, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, man. Hi, it's a lady who you're calling her. Alright. I'll run and I bet you don't get many of those. Not too many. Okay, I wanted to make a comment on my collection. Okay. Okay, what I'm calling to say is basically, it comes down to this. People with millions of dollars get away with anything they want. Okay, you can get away with murder like old jeet. People with little boys, you can hang children off your balcony, close doors and Vegas to shop. You can do whatever you want and on TV and your bubble law. You don't get arrested. It's the American F. and Wavix. Here we got people like George making excuses for her. I'm going to have a dad to say that's not going to make it true. Yeah, but now a Porsche leper like you are me. You know, we do this and we're in jail and you know, in two weeks. Who's a Porsche leper? No, no, no, no. You're talking about people they're like multi-millionaires. Yeah, exactly exactly exactly. And I love you Neil. That's all I have to say for today. Thanks. Okay, take care. We're on the bed. Okay, bye bye. Nice. Holy old lady in Hailea. Boy, that's where I'm going to show even ladies and gentlemen. Sure, we're any more after George chasing all the way in the summertime. Five, six, seven, oh, five, six. That's why when people like Carlos and Miguel, oh, George, you get all these women calling and he's got so many more women. And then the book comes down. George, did I have any women? Remember that? They don't want to admit. I mean, they're embarrassed enough admitting they listen to me. And maybe you do have a lot more women as possible, but they sure don't want to be telling anybody about that. Right. I'm not so sure why, but it's just it's not socially exposed. Look, look. Oh, I just put out a piece of sandwich right on the board. And then he ate it. I'm sure. Oh. Yeah. Once you're favorite TV Info, Marshall, I hate all Info, Marshall's 140. Over 40% of the audience hates it. Of course they hate almost anything anyway, so at least they're consistent, right? I forgot about that. Right. They hate. You just hate. Grills gone wild video 72. They like those a lot. Ron Popeye'll show time or it's his rebarbecue 17. That's kind of weak, Ron. You know what? I mean, if we could go stuff a few more votes, maybe Ron would send us each one of the ones. That's not the crappy little ones. One of the big ones, you know, where you go to the whole turkey in there? I can think of a few turkeys I'd like to roast in there. Some of more here. Ron Popeye'll pocket Fisherman 14. How about this stuff? Was it STP? Was that just in the story, but it was like that. You know who would know Joe Costello would know because he's the car racing. I think Mario and Dreti are one of those hot shots endorsed it. Yeah. Oh, you know me. I'm in the business of that and I would never endorse it. I wasn't a hand, but it was somebody like that. And just posted, you know, port your crankation that's going to protect your engine for like the next 50 billion miles. You know, crap like that. It's familiar. I don't know. Those were old. I mean, those were ancient. Right. Also a lot of the British ones that go with the British, you guys on there. Very ancient. The fact there's that one pasty looking bread. I'm just the eras he asked Regan. Because you said that. Kind of like a round. This is your bag. Oh, you know what I'm talking about? He's on a lot of me. Even now. Kind of short. Round British. We'll have you. You're a city. Richard Patty is shirt round or British. Well, you should all know your auto racing Mr. and you better start learning about it. What's wrong with you? That was Miguel's response to the crankcase. I could have been to the crankcase. Five six seven. Five six. He's a crankcase. All right. Yeah, maybe you can a loaf with Mr. Eagle Gilbert. Maybe if he since he's something and getting all these funny body ports, he can get you a new head and a new brain. That would be good for starters. Or I should say a brain. I don't want to say a new brain. Here's a call from Davy. Hello. Davy. Oh, Neil, how'd we go? Pretty good. Um, listen, I'm opening what he called in, but the Steve Garvey product. He used to pitch was called fat trapper plus. Right. Okay. I was nervous because of the orange alert. I had to run home. Okay. Anyway, my three all-time favorites. D.D. seven, the sober Calacillot and the Tom boo. Financial money making seminar. Oh yeah, good one. Now what's the pillow one? What do they call that? The sober Calacillot was this doctor who was on there and this pillow was like filled with like, it looked like great not cereal. Mm-hmm. For the buckwheat pillow. You were supposed to see what it was like. He hours straight. Right. And, you know, they'd have the people would lay on it and be like, Oh, I slept for three days and then the audience. Oh, fantastic. It was good stuff. I'm going to get one now. So I can hang out on the bed with my, uh, great nuts. Absolutely. And we're going to make a call. That'll be good. Fantastic. Upside. Okay.

I always worked French code. What does that tell you? Go figure. But it was that CPR. What was it? Was that STP? Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. George, you see again. First he tells me Michael Jackson is not a pedophile. He feels sorry for him. It's his bad upbringing. Danny was a prick. And then he tells me, uh, this little guy go and he tells me STP was like your body in the store. But you just buy his is a product that you buy in the store. I understand that. But it was also originally. He was the informal. Well, so that what he opened up big mouth for. Let Carlos to tell her, well, of course he's busy eating. I don't want to hear him. Are you sure? What? Are you sure you don't hear me? Positive. Are you sure? Very sure. You don't even know who the British guy is. I'm talking about. He always wears the apron, the red apron. And he's like, I like a short round typical pastry Brit with a real heavy accent. And he's always selling knives or cookware or crap, you know. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, slick, 50. Slick 50. That was it. That's a stuff you pour in your crankcase. And then your engine at the, like, a piece by piece of false humor. And I said it was not as T.P. It was slick 50. Told you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 5, 50. You said it was, uh, Mario and Dreddy. I said Michael Jackson. You said it was Mario Lamue. Hey, Mario, calm down a little bit. Okay, what about your export? I didn't see that game. I was busy losing my money. Hey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey over there. Pop it on park. My good old pies on. Got a message for you today, Mickey. Here's West Palm.

They, they produce a, they produce a doer. Who does it? No, they, who, what do you mean the produces better not be doing it? If producer cuts somebody off, we blow their brains out.

I always sense his facts as in a giveaway a sideways for some Stravinoza. Saw the show with Michael Jackson last night. He makes aliens look good. You tell me this man is a man. And I think if he had best. The last question he answered was if there were no more children in the world. He would kill himself. Yes, I heard that. By the way, the show has never been better.

Neil. Yes sir. Are you doing Neil? No. I thought a Michael Jackson interview last night. It was very disturbing that this man has kids. And he said I kept watching after when the news came on. It had some psychiatrists. Two of them that were watching the interview. And they both said it was very disturbing. One lady said that they got a remove the kid away from him. Now. Immediately. But there's one thing that I saw during the interview that I kind of agree with him. When they were in the limousine, I don't know if you saw it. They were in the limousine driving to Michael Jackson's course. One that he buys all that crap. There's a lot of money in. The guy who's been interviewed asked him how much he worked. And he kind of shied back. And he said, I don't really want to talk about his life. He said he kind of said again. Come on. You know, tell me what your work is. He goes a billion. Right? But then Michael Jackson felt very uncomfortable. He changed the subject. And he knows what he asked me going. Go to King James C. Learns the Sawyer out of quarterback.

I'm a little bit of that. They'll kill some good time. But in other words, are we supposed to like have good time now? That's why we're having so much fun now. Because starting at 12 30 or one whenever they tell us, that's when they're going to raise it. You know what I'm saying happened before then. How big are you pouring? There's no good. They're not going to be a terrorist attack before they raise the alert. That's what I'm saying. Right. So in other words, until they officially tell us, there's just preparing us for it. Okay. What are you getting ready for it? Which is why? Then we can increase our alert level. We should use this target. Okay. Okay. Our personal alert level. Sure. Our loved ones. Isn't that your pal, your personal alert level? Pal, personal ass level. Sure. So there you go. They're going to be announcing terrorist threat level to be raised to orange today. They want anybody to get nervous. They'll panic. We've been through this before. And the fact that the rest of world is getting a little bit nervous about us. And North Korea. Don't get all excited. Okay. Cause it won't do any good. Just have a good time and hope for the best. I hope real hard. Here's my Emmy. Hello. Yes sir. Meal on Michael Jackson. Do you think that he passed on that skin disease to those kids? They're not his kids in the first place. Well, I, I, that was my question really. It's how many chromosomes of Michael Jackson's those kids have. I can, the big one. None. And the other thing I want to ask you, Neil. I want to, I want to try to get one of those teachers with a bush with the nose of the clown nose. Do you know where I could get one? No. Who's got a clown nose? Yeah. We'll find out somebody will call. The guy that, uh, that talk show that, uh, whose name rhymes with species, uh, without rates, that those things even exist if and, and when we brought him up, I wanted to, uh, to see if I could locate one. We'll find him for you. Uh, and listen, finally. Yes. Uh, all in power convinced me that we need a regime change. But he, but he here in the state. Thank you. Thank you. There's good. Excellent line. Gilbert just called by the way and said, Really? Really? Did he really? He really did. I'll be damned. Gilbert, Gilbert, solided by the way. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. And now we're talking about regime change. No way. No, we are talking about that anymore. I'm sorry. We're talking about weapons of mass destruction. See, they couldn't decide for one day to the next, which it was. First, it was regime change. Then it became weapons of mass destruction. Are you asking questions? No, not me. Not anymore. Not since they're changing the threat level. That was wrong with you, man. Now, what are these teachers? They got bush with the what knows? A clown knows? I'd like the Alfredi Newman one with the big ears myself. Although I guess we can just look at the screen and see that. I'll let the Hitler version myself. There you go. See there's George again.

Oh yeah, we got it. I'm just like, I've been on their okay. That's okay. Well, Michael Jackson is a wacko dude. Okay. My pants didn't wear a mask every day of my life. I'd probably grow up there when I was just like Michael Jackson. Maybe it's in him and a kid's to Afghanistan. Yeah. And the same thing was kids that his dad did to him. That's really new views. In fact, you know something maybe when we invade the bank that we can drop him over. You know, I think that they deserve him. He definitely fit in there. And that's made in purgatory. Okay. Thanks.

He mentioned he said I can talk for about two hours then, like run out of gas. And he was like gasping and coughing and gasping for oxygen. Eh? He might be ailing. I don't know that. I'm concerned about it. I'm not making a light of it. I just would like to know what all the stories. Anyway, the hump probably along from the Royal Caribbean. Maybe the fact that he surrounded by somebody old farce playing golf out there, then I have something to do with it. Then we got at 7 o'clock. You have baseball. The Hurcun's versus Campbell.

There are some of them on here that are printed, just think like the Perfect Pancake. How about the omelet maker? I don't know what they call it. You don't want to talk about it. It's like a pan, a two-sided, it's like that sandwich thing. That's the perfect pancake, I think they're talking about it. Is that what it is? Yeah. The Perfect Pancake, which also makes... Carlos says it is not an infomercial, and he ought to know. It's not. Okay. Sorry, but it is unlisted in commercials on here, on the internet. So he, Carlos, those words on the internet. www.1.0 for infomercials.com. Carlos says that that's the S.C.Nons TV list, which is different. I see. On TV. Video Professor, walk away the pounds. The roller hose. Oh, I think Gildy has got one of those. Ionic Breeze Quadra? Hmm. Finally, I'm going to waste there some on there, which I never heard most of them. Oh, Rich Packer sends me this, which is very important looking for a free plug for his kids. Why not? Third nostril, featuring Ray Parker, who is one of his... I mean, Ray Packer, one of his sons, and Deccasentax, featuring Bed Parker, is other son. With all these bands, Pompital Indoor Skate Park, and the Pompital Indoor Skate Park, 2171 Blount Road, in Pompital 7PM on what day? What day? Read, oh, Friday, February 7th. That's the night. There's an Indoor Skate Park in Pompital. The Pompital Indoor Skate Park, 2171 Blount Road, in Pompital 630PM, third nostril opens. Ooh, and Deccasentax, a fragile line, I don't know that's the... Anyway, the... Ooh. featuring Bed and Ray Packer, which is said, is one more information called 954, 979-7966, 979-7966. There you go. The oyster charred rich. He's always been very nice to us. It did something very important. I'm out of our music surveys one time, but I figured what it was. It was something marginal. 567-0560, pound 560 on a AT&T. Don't get nervous, but... The yesterday afternoon from the stage apartment, this was updating a worldwide caution that had been issued only two months ago. What was different about this one? About this one is that it is not only talking about so-called conventional attacks, the risk of suicide bombings of using some sort of explosive devices, but also now the risk of unconventional attacks, chemical and biological agents. This is something that the state department has never warned Americans about directly, and I'm told that the reason why they're adding this now, and why they decided to update the worldwide caution was due to those series of arrests that we've been watching and that Sheila McVicker and other CNN correspondence have been reporting on in recent weeks in Europe in particular. A number of people arrested in Great Britain connected to Rysen, potential Rysen attacks, and as far as other potential threats I'm told, Americans need to be alert as well about the possibility of assassination attempts of kidnapping. And as to where there is no specific region, they're told to be alert all around the world, Carol. They're told in particular to be vigilant in their places of worship in schools in homes that they may attend, and that if it all possible, they should try to congregate where Americans don't usually go. So it isn't very stupid. I think that when you're reporting obviously there isn't a lot of it that the U.S. government can offer Americans overseas other than to be on alert, and they do actually say that you should keep your personal documents on hand. And by that they mean your U.S. passport, bank records, your birth certificate. The marriage certificate you should keep. Cluck is your way, and just be prepared for the possibility of some sort of a terrorist attack. And obviously, Carol, they're saying that this is not directly related to Iraq, but rather to get correspondence in different places all around. I know that's it. The council and so on. All the stuff this week. It's just a coincidence. Not directly related. In fact, it's kind of related to Iraq. The same way that Saddam Hussein is related to Al-Qaeda. Very loosely. Okay, let's get back to fun in games. Okay, 1230 will put that thing on with Tom Ridge and John Ascroft, and then we'll all like, we'll make a run for it. You people are looking to board it, right? Here's plantation, hello. Yes, sir. I think you covered most of them, but you know, wasn't girls gone while just the spot, not a full information. No, full information, man. You must have good stuff. Well, remember, Leslie Uggans used to do that full information for the psychics before Miss Cleo. Right. Also, Richard Simmons, no one said that. Sure we did. Oh, he did. He did deal a meal and sweat into the oldies. The great cadre of the dozen now is AJ Floyd. He's the Z-Max. Z-Max, we got that. But what are your responses, Dr. Shapiro? Yeah. He has the woman in the lingerie on the couch. Oh, he's on there too? Yes, saying, you know, if you have a full head of hair, and all he has someone over there on the lingerie. But the best information was last night, really was Michael Jackson. Yeah. I mean, because I don't know what he's going to do. And all he has to do is work in real well by the way, their buying his albums like Halivay and Tel Aviv. I was just saying, he's reciting the way up. Oh, got it. He got sucker born every minute. Have a great weekend, sir. And I don't know the couch behind the TV. Right next to your bonfire, Phil Pigematics. I mean, I was what he was just babbling there. I was like, keep your documents handy. And you know, make sure your insurance is paid up. Now, is that our birth certificate was supposed to keep our I debt certificate? I'm not really sure what was done. I'm not really sure what was done. I'm not really sure what was done. I'm not really sure what was done. I'm not really sure what was done. You're dental records. Good thing they don't want to get anybody. His hysterical. You know what I'm saying? That's good. I'm glad everybody keep calm. We are. Let's get out of here. Here is, um, Pembroke Pigematics. Hello. Oh, yeah. And you know, do you have the, um, I'll run a hover information. Oh, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I used to be a Irmer watching that really late at night. They would sell you this kid. It had his book and writings and all those other stuff. Pieces of his body were in their two I think. Does anybody remember that to use the so-cosmetics, share in the... That, really, no. Oh, it was fantastic. And Neil, what did I ever do to you? I'm your only fan up here. Who the hell was that? Who was that? And he hangs up. I don't know. I might have to be the chronic guy from New York. Is that who that was? No idea. I haven't got a clue. No, do we care less? Why can't you just say your material without going through some kind of paranoid and making yourself look like some kind of a smuck in the audience to say, Aha! There's another one of those chronics. Last time he called, he said the same thing. Remember that? And we still don't know who to tell you are. Or what that's all about. And I've did that. Talk to him? Did I listen to his crap? Then he had something almost worth rather say. So what's the problem? What did I redo to you? Puts. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Miami, hello. Miami? Yes sir. Yeah, I wouldn't want to say something about Michael Jackson. That, you know, I watched a little bit of that show. Who could watch him for two hours? I don't know. Who was on for two hours? Yeah. Oh my God. And listen, I got fucking back over to the little pieces of bits of it. That's the one thing I never heard anybody ask him. Is he says that he's a biological father, he's kids. Sure. And you know, I'm not racist or anything, but genetically. It looks like that's an impossible to look at the kids. Yeah. Well, I thought they actually showed the faces of the kids. No, no, but you see that. You guys are just blind. Yeah, blue eyes. Well, maybe they're like half half half half. No way. No, there's not a trace. No, I agree with that. I don't think he's going to be like one chromosome now. But they have to. The point I'm trying to make is. What is it? You know, people are talking about, you know, that you know, him being a views of the children, which I probably agree with. Yes. Anybody, please, please, please, please. What's the deal is, you know, these kids are not fit. They're talking about, in fact, the game, taking these kids away from all of those. You know, are they legally adopted or are they his biological, is he supposed to be? He's supposed to be his children. He's supposedly was the sperm. Don't worry. That's what he said. Right. I think we need a DNA test. Sir, let's do it right now. Let's get charlac homes on a case right now. DNA test. My life. And low. This is for sure. You're my city. You're my family. Yeah. Yeah.

Uh, the best place to find anti-bush material on the internet is www.smirkingchimp.com. For the guy that called before. It's a story. What? Vatio manic. The Bob and Tom. Right. It is? But I'm much it's called Vege. That's right. You just need to go down one more. It is? One moment please. This is important. I've got important at all. Which I wish to have. Very important. Oh, there it is. Uh, smokingchimp.com. I've ever teased you. It is the impeach. Bush and train you to. Okay. But here's the important stuff. If we're going back to all this history that some people are promulgating here. As far as I know, this is the first time to complete sort of the Popeye Rancor products has been told. Somebody got me this from the internet. Says Tim Samuel, The curator of the upcoming, but wait. There's more exhibit at Napa's American Center for Wine Food Narts. Author of the just released book of the same name. Basically, goes from a table out on the street to national television. Most people are realized the complexity of the story. How the product of people in the salesmen are all tied together. The Popeye family combined Vard Villain showmanship with ingenious product design beginning with modest items such as the glass knife. It's always sharp and leading up to Rancor showtime or titsory and barbecue. Which you very likely see and experimented by on QBC by Scrooter Rancor. Ron Popeye is the Ron in Rancor. See we're right about that. But his father Samuel S.J. Popeye and his uncle Raymond Popeye over the Omanic man as in Vegematic. The family dynasty grew literally on the streets of Chicago, says Samuel Symbi people in the Popeye family selling goods and outdoor markets. County fairs and auto shows salesmen mandatables and trimest rising gestures and motions gathered people around them. They were all little products that were designed so a pitchman could take a suit case full of them, haul them to the side and sell them. The products got larger and more complicated. They were more scalable on TV and given flashy names in the most famous being the Vegematic. In the process, their products and members of the Popeye family became international popular culture heroes. Popeye family history is sensationalistic and for postures enough to be the making of an epic novel and unwritten mission of salesmen. This is very poorly putty. Nathan Morris, well it's because you know where the punctuation is. Nathan Morris, SJ's Uncle, soul kitchen gadgets on the jersey boardwalks in 1958, SJ Popeye's suit him for patent infringement. Popeye believed that Morris's roado chop, I remember that. Never used to turn. We had the little plunger on top. It was a blast if you put your stay with turn. The roado chop took close your memo zone chop. Amatic Morris was upset with his nephew. Feeling him ungrateful for the break. And gadgets sales and a court were more suffered as unharter attack. And a guilt riddle day, say settle the case. Only the Avazoncle miraculously become the very next day. SJ Popeye, like I was got a son of Ron Popeye, started in the business that cast him out of the family when Ron began Ron co. But it was Ron who came to watch shine them all. He's the woman of the autobiography. The salesman of the century, and you can buy a straight from oncopeylank. Ron co's television spots home to fast talking perfection. That's a classic pitchment technique such as the countdown, which you can still witness in Ron Popeye's QBC spots talking in the show time or content of the show. The notifications are on to date. The new episode of the show you've been looking at is the 30995. And of course there's always the bonus product. But wait, there's more. The promotion on television seems absolutely resistable. So Samuelson and case of the vagimatic 11 million more silver than 10 years of their production in 1951. I turn up examples of them all the time and they always still work. I think the very nature of the family of the pro, the family of the pro is everybody or their parents are older says some. Popeye related product tucked away in their closet. That's the opposite part not using it, but it's tucked away in a closet Amen Getting pretty crowded in there. Here's Miami, hello Miami, yeah, sir. How you doing? Okay? Every year product, man What is your virtual? Man we talked about it early. I shocked about it. Nads on edge. Yeah Yeah, you know the name is just too much. I don't know who came up with that one.

He didn't disagree so we do expect that announcement at 12 30 David is a student's a little natural incidental that this is happening perhaps on the eve of the US war against Iraq You know, I talked to officials about a lot about whether they think there is the possibility of terrorism by Stimulated by the muck barot the Iraqi intelligence service Whether the Iraqis perhaps in Kahuts with terrorist groups might organize something The response I tend to get is officials saying look the Iraqi intelligence service is not all that terrific It is fairly well watched It's not something we worry a lot about sure we watch them But we're not really expecting it to come from that quarter and frankly a number of officials saying They believe that if that al Qaeda would attack the US any time it could Without regard to any war in Iraq or frankly many other factors, but it sure does make you go to excuse don't it? Well here's Mike the old man who doesn't even look for a few plugged it in that nice He says I have the rotisserie machine works great and always comes out juicy I have the original machine 170 five bucks years ago I saw a little bit of Michael S.

Bush and Bill Clinton Clinton would win hands down your pants Look at the economy you look at the state of the world as we are in it right at the moment We got the terrible stuff going up through the roof. We got all this spirit of Saber rattling We got North Korea saying hey if you start with anymore this Hanky Panky over here and fishing around You're gonna open up a nuclear holocaust We've got a very unstable when you start you know rattling the spirit and call everybody evil doors and all this other stuff and and you know Not doing the things behind the scenes You need to keep a little bit of a sanity in the world. It makes for a very nervous place in which to live You see what I'm saying what are you saying let's go home.

Okay, so what we're gonna do is it was now wire they're at the podium. Did they say 12 30? Toad they said I mean if we're gonna have an end of the world. Let's do it on time 30 seconds they do Might say that our clock in here could be a little on the other side. I can't even imagine that Do it's very very important stuff. This is more important Facts just came in I went to days of my girlfriend about a year ago We're told by the waitress. They just got rid of the mother bugger pies and placed them with pies by companies like Hershey Which by the way, we're awful compared to the mother bugger's pies bad move venues important stuff when you think in fact that's enough Anybody really nervous crushed Yeah, so I get tell Tell Carlos when he comes back in no more eat out of the dumpster or a denny state Law enforcement going ahead and explaining to their constituents what this means This is gonna be a difficult period for them won't it very difficult I just spoke with the director of the Massachusetts emergency management agency and they're lieutenant governor At 130 at the Boston at the state house in Boston. We'll also be giving a press conference And you will see this going on around around the country will offend and it will mean different things to different states depending on the different states what kind of Vulnerabilities they have what kind of facilities that are located in each of the states So I think it will have a different effect on different governors and that'll trickle dawn down to the different to the cities and the mayors of the different cities and So it will have a profound effect most likely for Michael Bloomberg and George Patanki you respectively the mayor and governor of New York New York City and New York state given the fact that that area has been hit on 9 11 and the earlier as well Presumably it has a greater impact You know what I'm thinking while he's two in his lips because they still aren't up there and putting money to break okay because we don't want to miss one more Don't hang in everybody's hanging on the edge of their seats Minus because once it goes to orange, you know once they that thing could trip up to that red one You know just listen to happen with traffic lights happening Right level that's been in place for so long a yellow level which is called elevators The orange level which is a higher Of security meaning that law enforcement some 17 20,000 law enforcement authorities local state federal around the United States Have to deal with a much more serious potential threat out there the reason being and we'll get some specific Explanations from how credible this information is but There we go General there's a rock in copper and Robert Mueller a three pack you ready yourself trapped in Here we go Okay Currently classified at elevated risk to increase that threat condition designation to the high risk category This decision for an increased threat condition designation is based on specific intelligence Received and analyzed by the full intelligence community This information has been corroborated by multiple intelligence sources Since September the 11th the US intelligence community has indicated that the alkita terrorist network is Still determined to attack in a center Americans Both here and abroad Recent reporting indicates an increased likelihood that alkita may attempt to attack Americans in the United States and Or abroad in or around the end of the haja Muslim religious period ending mid February 2003 Recent intelligence reports suggest that alkita leaders have Emphasized planning for attacks on apartment buildings hotels and other Soft or lightly secured targets in the United States The recent bombings of a nightclub in Bali and Danesia and of a resort hotel in Mumbai, Sakinia Demonstrate the continued willingness of alkita to strike at peaceful innocent civilians and their ability to carry out attacks on such Soft or lightly guarded targets There are also indications bolstered by the recent arrests in London Where chemical Risen was discovered These Indications demonstrate alkita's interest in carrying out Thing that heightened awareness and readiness on our part Detour's terrorism Since September the 11th of 2001 the United States has substantially improved Its capacity to disrupt the terror and prevent Terrorist attacks terrorist attacks against Innocent Americans The active cooperation of the American people Your cooperation Has been instrumental in preventing major terrorist attacks Since September the 11th 2001 the federal Bureau of Investigation has evaluated and investigated over 3000 terrorist threats Within the United States Issued 103 warnings to state and local law enforcement And announced three not including today's announcement three major nationwide terrorist alerts The threat condition designation was last raised to high risk On September the 10th 2002 And reduced to an elevated risk standing two weeks later Today's change in the threat condition designation from elevated risk To high risk Will trigger a series of security precautions by the federal government as well as state And local governments and US citizens To increase readiness to prevent terrorism I have directed ants As we have in the past We ask that Americans continue their daily work and leisure activities With a heightened awareness of their environment and the activities occurring around them As President Bush recounted in the state of the Union address we have arrested or dealt With many al Qaeda key commanders 3000 suspected terrorists have been arrested worldwide Other terrorists have met a different fate We've uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies in the United States In Yemen Singapore Saudi Arabia The states of Hormuz and Gibraltar We've broken al Qaeda cells around the world And with the support of the American people We will prevail in this war on terror It's my pleasure not to introduce the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tom Rich Definitely to the end This heightened threat level Has been or is being communicated to local and state law enforcement officials Federal agencies Members of Congress Governors State Homeland Security Advisors Mayors And those who share responsibility for the nation's private infrastructure Information is also being provided to the nation's first responders Our fire emergency Do you make a statement of the city personnel? Do you make that note? Your nation's Homeland Security Advisory System provides a national framework to inform and to facilitate actions Appropriate to different levels of government and to private citizens Either in their workplaces or in their homes The system couples the threat level With protective measures The shorter will be taken to reduce our countries of vulnerabilities As a result of the increase in the threat level As a result of going from yellow to orange Elevated to high Specific protective measures will be taken by all federal agencies Both to reduce vulnerabilities and many of them actually will we believe serve as a deterrent An advance of any kind of emergency Whether it's a natural disaster or a terrorist attack doesn't take a great deal of time And I think it would make family members a lot more comfortable if they knew they were able to get in touch with And they events something happened I think there are ways that parents and adults can certainly be better informed Because as we've described to you Territus attacks Really can potentially take many form families can be armed in advance with a kind of information That you might need and that will be critical to your health and your well-being and I would encourage Americans to Log on to the department's website You can log on to www.dhs.gov Turn more information to become better informed About steps that individuals can take simply to be better prepared The call that we Give today Which Americans have certainly heard before Is based on our knowledge and our conviction that heightened awareness and readiness Deters terrorism Each of us In our own ways can contribute to the security of our nation Our families and our communities Today, if that alert public is our strongest asset If you observe suspicious activity Encourage you to contact your local FBI office or your Local police and to report such activity Thank you and let me turn over you general. Thank you in god bless America.
