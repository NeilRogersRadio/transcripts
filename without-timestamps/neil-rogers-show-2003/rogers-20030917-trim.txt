Hey NEO, the Hockey News came out with a cover in the 2020 9-0. You all you do is bitch. That's an 88 guys in the NHL. You know, dog hitter right man. These sports shows with these 85 minute breaks. You're getting money maker. You run 45 million come out. You're doing commercials for dead people. We have 16 minutes an hour on your phone. We're just one of the audience. It's been a long, all sports radio. See we thought it was all sports radio. They left the R out. It's all sports radio on the sports show. It was man dogs right. You're right. I spent the day yesterday. I spent the day with the Madagascade, the touchdown club, but all those money makers. I was interested in it. I was interested in it. I spent the day with Madagascade, the touchdown club. I want to hear about that. Hey guys, in the NHL that need to be great this year. You know, to put on the cover is Eric Lindras. He's careers over. The Leafs won five three last night in Helsinki. I knew like they against Yokewood. Whatever in Hale, Yokewood. Here's the players they think they deserve. That's a little finished girls team. Byron the foe. They're finished. Yarmary Yager. This idiotic article you sent me from Monday. But it's all who's about the people washing their hands. You wash your hands at first table. And wash my hands whenever I feel like it. Okay, depending on what I had a mom. But anyway, it says here, Royder's Toronto International Airport. Even you know it's Pearson International Airport. But a bunch of mullons at their orders. They probably work at the Sunsimil. Do you know that the Sunsimil still hasn't discovered the dog cock's died on Monday morning? Yeah, they haven't discovered it. Do you think that the NHL gone straight next year? They still think that. What do you mean do I think they're going on straight? They're going to have a lockout and maybe for two years they're saying now. Wow, so they had 2005 in the hotel. 2004 and 2005. Possibly. No, what do you say? They don't beneath them and no more hockey. People, they sold that thrash routine in Atlanta with that nice arena. They're penniless. What do you mean by that? Well, they sold them. They had, they, they don't money. And then the women's soccer league went on everybody's going under. Everybody's going out of business. The violence, last 14, nothing. I know you get excited. Have a nice day. No, seriously. Let me say this to you. Okay. They make a playhouse with Steve's laughing. Who's one up and it's no different blues than 14 up and half. My hat. Loving up and you don't sleep well. It's still only one game in the, in the standing. So they have to drop games off. Do you think they'll make the playhouse or not? Yes. And when they do, should I have a party at Kavey Aguana and T. Yeah. I good luck to you. Have a nice day. And you too Scott. Hello, I'm a hair. Yeah baby. Get down, baby. We'll be in the wild. I drop in on the floor. I was turning blue. I'd bad run after you. I was every thought that I would die at the same time that Johnny's magic was new. You got the ambulance door. No, I have no list. No, there's nothing else you can do. Johnny and I are three who do take your back on it. That's our leader pass away with the boy named Stream. I think I may have caught something when I'd thank you, that's our name. I always thought you were a fool. Well, let me show I could do. Oh, it was David's arm and from the alcohol and in the cocaine. Oh, it was a star on the tune. And that worked the way to the star. 10. Oh, it was 7. At 5. 60. That was in very poor taste when you agreed. Yeah, I was right. It was a fragile lot, immensely. So anyway, we got short show today because we're not a ball game or anything but we got our big wins. They wanted two hour and now that we got abbreviated they condensed for a segment here because for all I can't how what time it is. Of course, it was hard enough. It was pretty important stuff there in the last segment. No, no. Who's the biggest nerd of them all we asked, just do we got to. I think I figured out how to solve errors dilemma by the way George. That's that because they're acting up again. No, no, he's got a lot of other stuff to do. I mean we're small potatoes. He doesn't make any money off our website. It's a labor of love. A little right here. But on these days when we do like two polls like today when we do the preliminary one, and we're building the second one. Yeah, even though it'll cut down on the number of votes, we don't have to put the second one until they end with the show. Okay. You see what I'm saying? There's no reason why we have to follow. No, you're right. We had the show poll and the post of a poll. We did a lot of work. Yeah, it's our first time, we said that. We have to put the poll into the way to compile it and then we put it on our tail of the show. Just one quick facts or email over to Eric and he slaps it on there. So it doesn't have to devote all his precious time eating time. I mean, work in time. So the new Runges website. We want to maintain a great quality, we've had, on there. Thanks to your close personal drug addicted friend, who's the biggest nerd of them all we asked yesterday. What is the long list here? I don't have time to read them all. We'll just do the double digit once. a crap. They wanted him to just die a wicked death. Bill Gates 234. Caratop 17. Woody Allen 97. George W. Bush 91. Rick Riley 47. Who's been off the air for a long, how long have you been off a couple of years now? That's about right. I think that's pretty good for you seven votes for being off the air that long, but they remember what a nerdy he was. Paul Shafer 39. Al Gore 35. Jewelieberman 33. Joseph Gekke 32. All I forgot to ask out how come he sucks Joseph Gekke. He's as don't even forget tomorrow. Oh, you're supposed to remind me, but we were sure it on time because I wrote it down like for all in Joseph Gekke. Can you believe how long that break went on? Yeah, I believe it. Three minutes after 10. Oh, you just given the for a whole first segment. Hey, fine with me. Less less work more paid. That's my motto. He can go till 10 30 if you want. Shabu Lee's dead. Good enough for Howard's Burma's good enough for for out. You can go to 10 30, baby. Just let me get in the spots. Joseph Gekke 32 Benstein and Brian Arcos, he said 31 Adam Sandler 29. Screech had 29. Yeldy had 29. He was the latest. Nice going Yeldy. You twerp. Tucker Carlson and George Willie said 24 a couple of right wing assholes with both ties. Ross P. R. O. 22 Mike Lupica 20. Bob Costa 17. Sean Heddy and Matthew Lesco 16 and J. Fieler 60 would have been years. Alex Pingu Pecania 14. Rick Moore Ainess 12. Clay A. Kintin and word Alienca Victor. That's what Karen said this morning. He wanted for the new year more Ainess. He said that yesterday too. He says it every day. He ain't getting it though. He ain't getting much. So that's our yesterday poll. Now here's the first one today as we're poll intensive climb on it. Now that we got the official announcement day by John Edwards who's got a Chinaman's chance in purgatory and now Wesley Clark general Wesley Clark's going to throw his hand at the ring today. Why do they use that expression? I thought about that. Throw his hat into the ring. Let's do it. I think something comes from Thomas Lawd. I'm a black and black. Back in the days when he's the one those big fedoras. Remember the godfather Michael had the big fedora? Is that like if you wanted to participate in the boxing match when he came back to see K when she would have class outside of school. He had that big old fashion fedora on her. Yeah, that was a really fashionable very gay hat. What's important K is that how we're let's see who'd you like to see is the Democratic presidential candidate next year. And here's the list. I think I got him all honor. And we don't want any names of like uh uh uh Hillary people that are running. People that are running. Howard Dean Wesley Clark, Julie Roman John Kerry, Bob Graham, John Edwards, Alshark, and Venice, and it's Caralemosley Braun. I don't care. I'm for Bush, I don't care. They all suck. I think I got a cover there. Don't you? That's it. Did I leave anybody out? That's what I should say. It's actually running. Right. Anyone really? No, no, seriously. I even put like Caralemosley Braun on there. Nobody knows who that is. I'll Sharpen's kind of a joke, but uh he's running. Uh and let me also say this, the FDA sucks. I just want to mention all look at this 14 more suits are pre-stins shirts. Where's this the insiniting? Jesus, this stuff is just pouring in here about the guy that they've pre-sts. The most important story of the day though is about Is that a lady that they're coming out of? Is that a lady that they're in this room? Oh, you're all right. Oh, you're all right. Just to sure what a banana republics offload is. Sweet, Dolphins, my tribute to Celia Cruz, it builds matchup on Sunday. How do you like that? I mean, what kind of crap is that? Are they having a tribute to John Ritter? No. Are they having a tribute to Johnny Cash? They all know, but are going to sing any Johnny Cash music Sunday to boggy? No. But only the banana republic baby. They're doing it again. Celia Cruz. The Dolphins have announced plans to hold a tribute to salsa legend Celia Cruz during half time of Sunday and I skin against the bills, but I could be an ugly game, man. Cruz has been Pedro Knight. We'll receive a daughter. Do you think he's kind of sunny night? We'll receive our guess it's confidential. We'll receive a Dolphins jersey during the Tribute which will put a performance by Latin Grammy nominee, Victor Manuel, who obviously is not from Cuba. Better not be. Cruz 78 out of a brain tumor July 16, the Cuban as well was immensely popular in Miami. So much so that Kaiio Ocho, the mainstream running for the city's Cuban community, has the honorary name of Celia Cruz way. I thought that dressing in drag was the Celia Cruz way. The Tribute's part of a Latin themed added pro players. They demand her of Hispanic heritage month. I didn't even know that did you it's his fan of heritage month? I know idea. Are you proud of? His your Hispanic heritage? Oh, yeah, I got the flag painted on my face. Well, I would be proud to unless I lived in South Florida that I'd be embarrassed. Anyway, Marty Sintron leads singer of the Latin pop group No Mercy schedule performed the star-spangled banner before the game on acoustic guitar and addition to 150 fifth graders from Ben Shepherd, L. My preschool, Ohio, will be on the field for the half time ceremony holding flags from 20 Hispanic nations. No, it's pick it up. I English, hockey, okay. So there you go. That's what's going on Sunday night before the bills trounced it off and so what probably would be one of the most embarrassing losses since that 62 to 7. That was at the score Jacksonville. It was pretty bad. No, it wasn't that 62 to 7. You know, now that you're on the payroll, these ambiguous answers aren't going to cut it. Let's get right to the chase. Massachusetts now an official candidate for his party's nomination. Don't interrupt. Go to some phone calls for watching Larry King Live. Denver, Colorado, hello. Senator, Kerry, how will you pay off the deficit? You're going to have to kick back in more money now and by the way, we're going to penalize every family in America. Portrait chief Florida, hello. I'm going to do Kerry. Is it true that you used to work at series as a mannequin? Oh, absolutely. You have 19 years experience? Olympia Washington, hello. Senator Kerry, what will you do with healthcare? I had health care because I'm the United States Senator and I could afford it and that's why I'm going to see to it that everyone in America can't get what I got. We can't serve all of you because we don't have enough money. The reason we don't have enough money, Larry, is because I party. Gardner message uses, hello. Senator Kerry, how's the healthy? Are you really nice to ask? I'm able to say that I am cured and I want to stay that way. Thank you, Senator. We'll be seeing you again soon. Thanks so much. Senator John Kerry now an official candidate for his party's nomination. In 1019 at 560 WCM, so somebody immediately facts as a sin which we thank them profusely. What is the meaning in the origin of the expression of throw once hand into the ring? When you throw or toss your head into the ring, what you're doing is informing everyone that you're willing to win or contest. The expression these days is normally used in politics when somebody throws his head in or into the ring, he's announcing to the world. He's a candidate that coming election, in other words, he's contesting here a few examples. Rainnuka is seriously considering throwing your hand into the ring this time. Are Junus from the Hindu newspaper in India? So that's why we got these Indian names? Yeah. Are Junus tossed his head to the ring, this should make things interesting. I would sound people out before throwing my head. The expression comes from the sport of boxing in the old days whenever somebody threw his hand to the ring and boxing. It implied that he was challenging the boxer. He was willing to fight the person in the ring. A well-known boxer, John L. Sullivan, used to go through this ritual every time he fought. After defeating his opponent, Sullivan would toss his hand to the ring, this was a challenge to the people in the audience. If the man who challenged him was able to ran on the street to the end of the bath and saw them used to give him a prize, they were not too many occasions when he actually had to pay the challenger. How do you like that? So the original meaning of throwing a hat in the ring was to challenge it was only in the 19th century the expression took on a meeting at yesterday, announcing one's political candidacy. How do you like that? And probably I said something to do with Hattrick and Hockey too when you think that's not sure. No. Probably. Anyway, I love this fact, this is a very good stuff. Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson prayed on the Christian broadcasting that worked based in Virginia Beach that Isabelle would turn from the coast. He asked God to put a wall of protection around Virginia Beach and East Coast. In the name of Jesus, we reach our hand and faith. Commanded storm to cease its forward motion to the north and turn and go out into the sea, Robertson prayed on the 700 Club. He's got any chance for that happening? No. As it continues moving north, north, west at about nine miles per hour. In fact, I'm thinking right now I have a psychic vision that it's going to like go plowing right into Virginia Beach and write up Pat Robertson's actome ass. How do you like that? I'm going to leave a pray. If you ask me, that's when I'm praying for it. Oh, in the name of Jesus, in the name of God. Let's pray that that storm that the eye, the old brown eye of Hurricane Isabelle. Why is it that every time I say that now I start thinking of it? I see that cruise. I can't stop. Every time I start that crap, I just can't stop playing it, you know? Now the enthusiasm of Sunday night celebration and tribute to Celia may be tempered some month when a P.A. announcer doesn't answer the crowd officially. It has been determined by the autopsy that Celia was a man, but that's beside the point. I guess people discriminate people already knew that, didn't I? I guess. So Pat Robertson says he's praying for it. Now a lot of people die and that's why I've played those I'm dying over here. Things a lot of people die and they're dropper like flies. We can't even keep track. In fact, a sunset, seriously, I don't want to go too ape on it because obviously South Florida is so insensitive anyway. They don't really give a crap. We didn't have one call from anybody since Monday, I announced it that anybody saying, well, you know, Dynk Cox was a real personality and it's really a shame. He was only 55 years old. He died in his sleep. He was up there taking care of his ill mother in Joejin Atlanta. Nothing because the people of South Florida are calcine and different. So maybe they deserve this come sentinel. See, even if they would have even have tough wouldn't have emailed the information of Tom Jick or what he did. He told me that again this morning, even if he wouldn't have done that, they could have ripped it off out of the hero, which would be the first night they've done that. Sure. But no, because when Jerry Williams died, did they care? No, when the Casper died, did they care? No, because Tom Jick or one of those guys might have to do a little homework and talk to a couple of people, which is so much more difficult and time-consuming than just writing it up. Puff opinion piece about some bogus fault TV showed it's going to cancel in three weeks anyway. See, I think you're the one that's wrong. I see, keep presuming the Tom Jick as a radio writer. He obviously stopped doing it. I just said Tom Jick or somebody, I'm assuming him because he's supposed to be the long time lost in a radio time. He knows his hands of that. But he watched his hands while he was a person in a truer under national airport. What a crocker crap, you know, this is the kind of stuff that makes it in the news wires. Oh, 96% of the people at truer under national airport, which it's not called are washing their hands as compared to like 75% how about some of the Pakistanis and Indian people? Are they washing it? No, and you can believe me. You know, I've brought that up so many times over the years and people refused to acknowledge, I guess because there's so many perocule people in the US, they refused to acknowledge that people's diet and their skin pigmentation result in a different aroma. You know what I'm saying? Sure. Because it's very easy to say. Well, gee, they haven't seen a bar of soap in 15 years. And that's possible, I guess, by I think there's like a pigmentation thing like people from Indian Pakistan. You know what I'm saying? Not not all. Oh, like curry. Kid Curry has something to do with it? I'm sure he did. I'm sure he did. I'm sure he did. Now that is good buddy, Tom Costa is that on Monday. At least I'll say one thing for Kid Curry. He's not making that an excuse to screw off. Okay, like Greg read it. Oh gee, I'm all broken up about Cox. I can't deal with that now. But we didn't get Scott on a payroll. He's got the paperwork filled out. He's like a step away from the payroll. It's coming. Anyway, guess who died? You already know because you fact these. Right. I got too energetic. I'm going to go and I'm going to go and I'm going to go with the other one first. The one that doesn't really bother me all that much. I'm not broken up about it. Gardner Ted Armstrong, evangelist known for the world tomorrow. In Tyler Texas, evangelist garnered Ted Armstrong known for his work on the religious TV program. The world tomorrow died Monday afternoon complications from Pena Monia. Mr. Armstrong 73 died in Tala Hospitalist son Mark Armstrong told the Tala morning telegraph. Here comes the best part of this story. Just like Pat Robertson, we cannot fully understand why the healing we beg for was not granted. Mark Armstrong said to written statement, I know that my dead fully expected that his work will continue and we've all got enormous responsibility to make certain that his work has not been in vain and that his voice will not be silenced. Yadi, yadi, yadi. Mr. Armstrong founded the Church of God of National in 1978 after his father Herbert W Armstrong, the late father of the Worldwide Church of Godx communicated to the son from the Church based in Pasadena, California. He founded the garnered Ted Armstrong, evangelical even evangelistic, association in Tyler and 70 along with the Church of God of National. Yadi, yadi, yadi. How do you like that? Yeah, that was the original one was Herbert W Armstrong. I forgot about him. Hope and then we had garnered Ted and now we've got Mark who says we can't understand why the healing we beg for wasn't granted. Can you understand it? Nope. Me neither. Maybe God was busy. Maybe he was maybe God was working on a tribute for Celia Cruz. We would be doing a fanhead by the way for the best of the meal today, but it's very dubious because Miguel has the service to read twice before noon and then he'd take a little while. Well, in his case, he'd take a while from to get it up. I guess if they would blindfold him, right? Get him to tell him and tell him it was like the body of Celia Cruz or even an ambition. I think it might have greater impact. Take a Viagra. Take a bottle of Viagra. And the other death, this is really sad. Voka Bryan's going to be all broken up about this and all the other old farts like us too. I'm way like a Shabboli died. Oh no, better an actor in Westerns like high noon, who also recorded the number one poptity. The purple peacle eater has died. His wife said he was 82. This is a Nashville. Well, he suffered from leukemia in 1996. Was hospitalized Monday at Scarland Medical Center of Nashville. He had just paid respects to American music legend Johnny Cash on Sunday. It was just his time to go set his wife Linda. Woly who died Tuesday, paired more than 60 movies acted in some 50 TV shows and recorded pop and country songs on a big screen. Woly appeared in most of Westerns, beginning in 50 as credits included high noon as a whiskey drinking killer outlaw Josie Whales, Warwagon, distant drums man with other star giant and Hoosiers. The purple peacle eater about an unidentified flying object sold 3 million copies in 1958 as the number one pop record. We got it. We got it. Oh, there it is. I thought I heard. What he goes got it. Look, I'm doing my job. Don't get crazy. Did he say one big brown eyes always? Okay, that's a sheb always dead purple peacle eater. That's enough like a sim. Kill it. Thank you. 10's lot more we've played more, but we don't have time because for all of us back into a box here. 10 27 at 560 WQM announcing a gigantic humongous 2003 New Orange's blowouts hail it's going on right now.

And when you put in a record presents the dosed book if you were sounds of Celia Crews, she's dead you know. So keep in my eye on Isabelle and I'm noticed that if it just takes a slight jogger how these things wobble especially what's the first hit land. Just a slight jogger to the east. It's going to smack right into Virginia Beach. Oh please I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry oh Jesus please here's a lady in plantation hello.

I'm sorry I'm calling the seat you can kind of press your leg and put it 10 point in a location today because that like rearranging my days like a meet up with whoever he's going to be. I don't think he's going to be anywhere today except in the office and the Reins because you mentioned on Monday he would be out in the van on Wednesday. Well that's what they keep telling me and they keep stalling off. I foresee a real mitigated disaster this year in our fundraiser because they're just that we always get leftovers we get nothing. This radio station gives us absolutely no assistance whatsoever. Well maybe you can use some of your pressure there and get them out. Well we're a Jellacum to be. I'm a rower I don't care. How about how about that? Shella University in Broward that's always a real popular spot. That's right by where I'm at right now. That's what I'm saying I'm going to work on it. Okay Greg you have a good day Neil. You two thanks. All right. Here you go Miguel the University in Broward to Shell Station. That's one of our most popular spots across where the cops used to make the coffee but that the convenience is right there no more. Well that's too bad. You know what I'm talking about? No. Oh well that's kind of my an effort. I don't know. You don't have to be a priority. Right across the New once popular Broward Mall and right down the street from the once not so popular Macy's Mall does anybody really ever shop in at Macy's Mall? There's always jammed with cars. I haven't been there in so long. Probably just the people who worked there. Last time I was there is when you did a fundraising appearance there. Right and it was like nobody there. I was your birthday. That's right. And the gigantic birthday cake nobody was there because right who ran was there in a stank. That's right. That's right. That's right that they were screaming running out of there. They got with that smell. What is that smell? It was screaming. Right. Well whatever part it was. Anyway here's the first pull it's up there now and we'll like like I said 74 votes. Wesley Clark 21 Howard Dean 15. I don't care they all suck 13. I don't care I'm per bush 8 10.8% of this crowd. Bob Graham 8, Al Sharp and 5 John Kerry is scary 3. John Edwards 1 0 for Julie women. Oh, that's because the Orthodox Jews have abandoned this show and thank goodness. Dennis Cassinid maybe they're out there rubbing their sisters together. Dennis Cassinid's none and care mostly brown has none. Isn't that a shot? No. So now the pull that we're going to work on today during the show and like I said, thanks again to Mike and Cooper City or where but it really was. Where was the Cooper City? Where was it? I don't know. Mike in the Yenem's belt who facts to yesterday. Coconut Creek about dead people because it really pisses off mo. Absolutely. We do pulls and dead people. We still have this gigantic audience and he has no numbers at all. By the way the trend tomorrow morning 11 30 the arbitrends for June July and Augusto. It's going to be really pressure pack. Oh, I'm listening. It's going to be heavy. Heavy. Judy trust me when I tell you. So the first we're going to do a series of these pulls on dead people and then we'll have like a dead off at the end. Right. Right. That's your favorite dead political figure. By the way, Schmidt can that idea had Eric that was a really bad idea and quit interfering with programming. See, I solved his dilemma right off the bat tonight. That was brilliant, by the way. Then I have it to sit there for all four hours and adding and throw and also for you. E-mailing and all the other. I can just email. Right. Tell us at the end and then they have plenty of time. They got like a whole bunch of hours to vote on it. And it also leaves the first pull up there. Whatever we do, we can do a whole bunch of pulls. I've done that. So you say in one day. Oh my. Who's your favorite dead political figure? JFK. This is a list I got so far. JFK Martin Luther King promised you I present FDR Teddy Roosevelt, Abe Lincoln or Bobby Kennedy. I think that's a good list. We're a starter. Don't you? I like it. I mean, somebody probably said, where do you have any heirs in? I don't even have enough sense to come in out of a rain. I like that to be canoeing Tyler too. Do you ever see pictures of him? No. Where do you have any heirs in? I mean, I'm trying to have him. I would even see pictures. You'd have seen painting. Right. Like a grisel old white-haired guy in a, look like an old troll speaking of old trolls. 14 then yesterday sued the Roman Catholic art sciences of Cincinnati, Archbishop Daniel Polarczyk and the Reverend Lawrence Strip Matter of kiddering Ohio bringing to 24th of the number of man-cleaning lawsuits that Strip Matter sexually abused them as boys and arts dices covered it up. In fact, let me find my story from the Boston glow. Here it is before I finish with that straight on me forget. In the month after releasing it's much anticipated new child protection policy on May 30th officials in the arts dices of Boston quietly revised document to curb access by led victims of abuse to records of church proceedings in case of accused priests. Prices. That's like practices. The revisions which church officials say were necessary to correct ambiguous language in the published policy of drawn criticism from advocates for abuse victims who fear about backing away by the church, a backing away. So by the church from promises of greater openness in such matters, changes to the policy were apparently made without the knowledge of members of the commission to put about carton allaw to up-crafted or members of a second their lay adviser committee charged with overseeing a civil ma- in other words in quiet behind closed doors to try to like do everything they can to hush it up. Anyway, getting back to Ohio. The 14 then referred to as John those numbers 11 through 24 in lawsuit filed in Hamilton County Common Police Court say they were abused by Strip Matter between 1968 while he was working in Cincinnati including a stint as principal of elder high school always be nice to your elders. Strip Matter's 24 accuses are seeking four million dollars each in damages of total of 96 million. The arts dice he's assigned strip method now 70 to be associate pastor of St. Albert the great church in Kettering in 1988 after he was removed from a Cincinnati church because they substantiated abuse allegation and required to undergo impation psychological therapy. And it goes on and on and on. And along story and I'm sure that's all they to begin. Another one of those isolated the series of incidents another isolated 24 in just with that one priest and it goes on like I said it on and nobody cares. Just like Dick Cheney keeps lying through his teeth. Here's the latest one. That only go on meet the press on Sunday and lie about the connection between Iraq which now down rum spelled no less than down rum spelled says all there's no link between Iraq and 911. What? Really? Yeah the fence secretary down rum spelled said yesterday he had no reason to be a reason to believe that Iraq's bottom who's saying had any hand in the September 11th terrorist attacks in the US. And a Pentagon news conference from so disaster about a pool that indicated nearly 70% of respondents believe the Iraqi leader probably was personally involved. I've not seen any indication that would lead me to believe I could say that rum spelled said. How do you like that? I'm shocked. Yeah, random act of honesty. Now Vice President Cheney who of course in addition to that lie about that the former CEO of Halibut and companies received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the company in the Ford salary payments and taking office while asserting he has no financial interest in the company Senate Democrats at yesterday Senate democratically to Tom Dashle is South Dakota and Senator Frank Loutenberg of New Jersey's that the revelations we enforce that he only know we left off the pool. Dick. Dick. Dick Gabhart George. Make sure that Iraq has him on. I'm sorry. So easy to forget about Dick for some. Senate democratically to Tom Dashle is South Dakota, Senator Frank Loutenberg of Jersey's that the revelations we enforce the need for hearings about the no bid contracts for reconstruction work and a rack that Halibut is received from the Bush administration. On NBC's meet the press program Sunday, Cheney lied at Cheney City at severed all ties with Houston-based company. Kathy Martin at Cheney spokeswoman confirmed that Cheney had been receiving payments from Halibut and has been, but she disputed that a statement Sunday to President Miss Leady. Right. Cheney had already earned the salary that was not being paid Martin said, adding that once he became an nominee for Vice President, he bought an insurance policy to guarantee that the deferred salary would be paid to him. So it's just, you know, it's like a chess game, you know, like a shadow boxing, like a shell game, like they do on prices right, you know, where they move the thing around under the appeal of shells. That's what he's doing. He's moving it around under the appeal of shells, old Dick Cheney. Just unbeatable. In fact, one of the bedtime stories that we have on our website today is about the fact that this President has lied more to the country than any President in the history of this country. And I think that whoever wrote that is, that's the only correct answer. 19 to 11 at 560 W.M. We got a pristine schedule later.

Speaking of that, after battling to a virtual draw on same-sex marriage yesterday, the liberal Canadian government and Canadian alliance agreed to re-a-a-re-match at the ballot box next year. The divided liberal government's planned legalized game marriage barely passed a critical first test, but it did pass as MPs voted 137132 against an alliance, and alliance-motion-preserved a traditional definition of marriages, one man and one woman. They said, ah, just barely, I watched this matter, fact. I watched the vote. Yeah. And they like stand up in a mother and mother-read that a book, but I said, It'll wear all of silly wigs like the brits. No, they don't as a matter of fact. Not like seeing a cruise. 560, pon-560 on a AT&T in a Verizon wireless line. Here's my any, hello. My any, when is this? See the cruise line, yes. Is this your dad? Sounds like me. There was talk about the contacts. I grew up with him in the 780s, listening to this, listening to his, and his shows that he was awesome. And the guy always said, it's my, my, my, my honest face. Right. Don't be missed. I mean, he's already, only, only, only, yeah. So anyway, you don't want him that, kind of sad for his loss. Well, thanks for carrying it up to send you very best, sir. You're the only one. Well, that makes one of us. And don't worry about how he needs it. Tom Jick is the doose bag. Thank you. Well, man, he really is you showing your two colors last year, two time. You're real smuck. Talk about having your finger on a pulse of what's happening in the community. Here's the guy that was on your net market for like 20 or 30 years. And it's not like we're talking about somebody who, you know, who left the year 20 years ago or something. You know, I'll decide on a mind that kind of thing. No, like Jerry Williams, maybe there was an excuse there all the way. I don't think so. But in this particular case, here's a guy that anybody and everybody who grew up in South Florida, New Cox on a radio. Right. The sunset, it'll can't be bothered giving the information out. Okay, you're an embarrassment. You're an idiot. Okay. I'm embarrassed that they actually let you fill on us radio station because you've lost it. Whatever to how you had it, I don't know, but you sure as hell have lost it. What happened? What's happening in the local community. But nevertheless, I mean, what am I getting excited about? I'm just consistent. At least he's consistently out to lunch. You just, you know, and this is supposed to be a freaking newspaper? No. That's why I keep telling you people. Man, if you had a real newspaper in South Florida, you'd see some real changes, but then never going to happen. It'll never happen. If you had a real luck out like a tabloid, like we got the throw out of the sun here even with the right wing politics, but it's like a real newspaper. If you had a tabloid in there, put the goddamn sun settle in a hill right out of the business, put him to shame, put him on a back burner. A real newspaper with some people who had balls and weren't pandering all the time, and writing a bunch of puff piece crap, and who could afford to like Harrison real writers in there as opposed to these high school stringer kids that they had there right 95% of the crap. And these dodging silly guys that used to write about dog racing, to be TV and radio critics and experts. But nevertheless, here's a call from TV, hello. Well, yes sir. Yeah, I didn't know that's on car's career when he just happened. He died Monday morning. Ah, see, there's up visiting his sick mother, where you have a heart attack or something. He just died in the sleep. Wow, what ever happened to stand major? Ah, he died, but nobody told him yet. I said it. It was his career that died, I guess. I don't know, Stan Sterler. He's still fumbling around. Okay, just curious. And he still owes me that money too, by the way. Wow, well, this like Larry King owes you 50 bucks, right? Exactly. All right, take care. Okay, you two. Well, there's a guy who seemed mildly interested. Who's your favorite dead political figure? That's the poll we're building. They all went through, we're not getting any suggestions because there's so many, but nevertheless, just the piss off, Mo. JFK, Martin Luther King, Thomas Jefferson, FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Abe Lincoln Bobby Kennedy, and let's say here, Mo. Let's hear Mo, okay? In the meantime, poll number one, and now I see we got to the cab right on there right away. Now, now, Eric can just sit back, have his branches, take care of all of his other important paying customers, and just forget about us. Right? Okay, even though it is a laborer blood. 171 votes already, this is shocking. Who would you like to see is the Democratic presidential candidate next year? General Wesley Clark was announcing they 45 votes already. And you wanted to know why that probably is? Why? Probably because they're thinking he can win. It would seem to me. I voted for Howard Dean's got 32. I don't care about those professional Jews who are vaccinating all that crap about they don't like his position on the Middle East. Like a suggestion them is, Cox a voice, okay? Take a good, very amen. I can't hurt. I don't care. They all suck 30 people say that. Bob Graham 25, two bad BDI Bob has never changed. He's said all the right things, but he has in all the wrong places. I would add some, sing all the right things in all the wrong places. I don't care. I'm for Bush 22 people say that about 12.8%. Al Sharpen's got seven. John Kerry who looks really scary. He's got four. John Edwards has got two votes. He's got two votes. Let's like it. Yeah, John Edwards. And what's wrong with having a president who could talk to dead people? Who we do? If you'd be perfect for South Florida, our talk to Jesus. Dennis Cassinu's got a pair. Dick Gimmhart is going to be finally put him on. He's still only got one vote. Jewelie Romans got one. Oh, he's got mostly grown out of 1801 votes. She's got the big. Oh, who is she kid? Now why she's hitting her wheels? What's the point? You know? What is the point? Why she wasting our time in our energies? She's hitting even in a real-elected nail in oil. Oh, by the way, my kudos to the, who isn't Illinois? Is it the governor? That did what? And also the mayor of Springfield, a Massachusetts who are like doing business, who are getting prescription drugs for the city and not, it's not the governor. But for public employees from Canada and the FDA is fighting a tooth and nail because the FDA sucks. The FDA are a bunch of grave robbers who are in bed with the pharmaceutical companies who want to continue ripping off the public in America and all over the world. And especially the old people. Get rid of it. Get rid of it. Get rid of it. And so now the FDA is trying to battle the mayor. He was on a small one on CNBC the mayor of Springfield, man. Who's saving his city like 809 million dollars. They animate all these budget cutbacks and cut back cops and all these other because they didn't have the money. They haven't in the budget. And so now he's going to reinstall those positions and get more cops and more public fire people, etc. Because there's $7.89 million here buying prescription drugs from Canada. And the FDA says, oh, but do we know about the quality of these drugs? Say the same guy damn stuff made by the same companies. Okay, like I say, oh, how can the people in Canada still be alive? I mean, we don't know if their prescription drugs are safe. One kind of crack is that what our layman's excuse to try to pull it over. They eyes it and then the public course in America says, hey, screw you at the 801 to say the money. We'll take a chance. We'll take a chance on those drugs from that dangerous third world country Canada. Right. What a shame and a scam. Try just mention that in passing. Here's my any hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Pretty good. Hey, last week you had a poll about the world's most dangerous man. Yes. And you last a good opportunity for one of your little bits. Do you have that owl wolf thing? One that goes, yeah, like that. That's that's got nothing in do with the owl gold steaming. Yeah. All this I have to do with the owl gold steaming. Kim Jong. Yeah. There you go. Pretty weak. By the way, how many holios you got to be at the dolphin bills game on Sunday night? About 30 minutes. I don't understand that. That whole this pandering thing that just never stops in South Florida. I could understand if it was like the Sunday night cock fights or something like that. Then have a big tribute to senior crews and have all these holios. I know speaking of ways people come in there and do their hoochie kuchi and with a morachi band. But at a dolphin game, you know, I mean, what's the point? You got like crack crackers and juices the dolphin crowd. And they just go to Fort Lee where she was living. In fact, as used the old Jews, they like those three saltines. They get along good with them crackers. How big are you part of it? Aren't you just go to, why don't they just go to Fort Lee? I mean, she loved the Latin community but she was living in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Well, there's probably a lot of teens in Fort Lee, New Jersey. No, there's a place in Jersey where to have all the acubes. What's the place? Rauai State. No, no, sir. Oh, come on. I'm serious. There's a place in Jersey that's loaded with acubes. What is the, where is it? Might be bail. I can't believe that between you being from Jersey and George being Cuban either one of you knows what I'm talking about. What is wrong with you? But what if it's in Jersey? Oh, Fort Lee isn't Fort Lee, Neil. It's for Reed. There's no Cubans in Fort Lee. 1057 and 560W. I'm just, I'm, I'm working alone today.

It might away Scott quit talking about it You idiot here's Volca. Hello good morning I'm calling about the rum so article you mentioned I read it too and I'm sure it's in live the poll that said nearly 70% of Americans Believe that I rack was directly related to the 911 incident right so I went and I started looking up because I specifically remember Run sell trying to make that that connection so when I found this on the internet today when he was standing in front of the Senate arm services committee in July He said the objective in the global war on terrorist to prevent another attack like September 11 or biological nuclear or chemical attack that could be worse And he says with confidence the world is a better place today because the US let a coalition of forces in the action and I rack But he draws those parallels he has any window and he threw the oldest propaganda at us to try to get us to make the connection between 911 and Iraq and the two months later he actually can't remember what he said two months ago exactly I think the only way to describe it is Right they lie a lot All right, good day, pali thanks. Thanks, pali have a great life Yeah, the public has started to see through it like looking through a pain of glass like looking through a piece of cellophane They lie through their teeth. There are people or American kids over there dying and getting just severely wounded every day It was like four more seriously wounded overnight every single day And by the way since we're still in such a good job between Osama yamama and Mula Bula Omar and The Sodom the Arabic news network LRB are today broadcast a new audio tape statement attributed to Sodom Hussein Last month, Al Jazeera broadcasted tape also important to carry the voice of Sodom CIA officials said they believe there was a high likelihood the voice on the earlier tape was at a Sodom and why shouldn't one today be he's still alive They hit him with five shots. He's still alive just like down Koleone In the past few months, several tapes said it was made by Sodom of an airtocling when in July urging Iraqis to resist US forces This report of the tape follows new attacks on US troops in Iraq where at least four soldiers were wounded the coalition for public information said are said the two day Is it saying anything else about the tape? Nights about it But I'd like that a new Sodom tape. We got him yet. No, no, but we're lying and we have the article we had yesterday that we have no idea When I need closer to Osama now that we were before but we're wasting all these billions and billions and billions of dollars and countless human lives in a war of futility for no purpose whatsoever Against the country that now we admit had no weapons of mass destruction wasn't connected to Al Qaeda wasn't connected to 9.11 Wasn't a threat to us wasn't 45 minutes away from the bridge with a new clear and chemical weapons and biological and all apart from your territory But you're mama you know that's basically what it boils down to you know like it can it's worth it Yeah, yeah, right What a what a shame what a scam But there's a Wesley Clark There's Judy Woodruff.

I've always been crazy on the fact. Probably so that will be toilets funding. It's 11.19 at 5.60 WQA and we got 293 votes already. Who'd you like to see is Democratic presidential candidate next year? General Wesley Clark was announcing making it official today. He's got 80 votes. He hasn't even announced yet. Here's the earhorky Isabelle. It's heading right for Virginia Beach. It's a terrible rainfall and we do have a threat for inland flooding. And let's just talk a little bit about inland flooding. Yeah, that's not. Wesley Clark 80 Howard Dean 53. I don't care they all suck 50. I don't care I'm for Boast 39. That's 13.3% Bob Graham 39. He's tied with a bushmeister. John Kerry 9. I'll sharp the 9. John Edward 7. Dick Gibbhardt 3. Dennis Cassinage 2. Julie Brman 1. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Somebody voted for Carol. Mostly Brown. Thank you. I want to hurt you left out. What? October 1. Is what? Smallville. Oh October 1. That's not there for a reason. It's a little bit late. So it's two weeks from last night. So we from next Tuesday is the new season of Smallville. You didn't see the season finale. Maybe they'll replay that right before the open. They'll reprise the last couple of minutes. You should see it a lot happened. Does it pop out? Is it super? There's lots of explosions. Oh, at least one. Squared. Yeah. Anyway, wait till you're this. In late August, the number of US troops killed since May 1. Reached to 138. Courses beyond that now. The same number that had died between the attack, beginning March 20th and Bush's Trump and Declaration of War was over. This was a depressing statistic in a course that rises every couple of days. But the Washington Post reported an equally depressing number on September 6th. Two years after 9.11, 69% of American surveys said they believed that it was at least likely that Saddam Hussein was involved in attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. I shouldn't be surprised. This is written by Alexander Contver. No, this is by Gary Loop. Leo. Counter punch. It's from the prison planet website. I shouldn't be surprised. He says National Geographic reports listen to this. That 85% of young Americans 18 to 24 can identify Iraq, Afghanistan, or Israel on Unmarked map. Oh my God. 56% cannot find the Indian subcontinent. Dangling. They're so conspicuously in another than the Indian Ocean. Only 9. Oh, this I can't handle it. Only 19% can name 4 countries that are now having nuclear weapons. Fortunately, a whopping 70% can identify the Pacific Ocean, but that's probably just because it's the biggest thing on a planet. But if you look at that kind of firstly, 30% can identify the Pacific Ocean. We're doing it. The numbers aren't just embarrassing, but dangerous because in such a sea of ignorance, swim bushes, neocons, void by it, empowered by it to send you as troops to their deaths, in order of conqueror and occupy nation. That had nothing to do with 9. 11. Repeat nothing and do with 9. 11. And repeats it about 20 times on here. It says the only way to maintain adequate domestic support for the ongoing war in Iraq is to promote that fiction, which means to deliberately and cynically exploit ignorance, worse to exploit racism and religious entitlements in the form of essentialism, the notion that all members of a particular community, in this case, Muslim Arabs and any one, be united things might look like one, are essentially the same for all practical purposes, in other words, smata heads. All working together collectively to get back at us as the good soldier puts it all couple both of the sins of their members. Oh, this is, I mean, no statistics. I just, I just, I just, I just want to barf, you know. I think you want to put my guts out. What is this all about? I'm going to take a hard year list. Conny, your favorite did political figures, Chagovara. Stinking, Connie. Oh, this is somebody hates you anywhere. Go out of Jim. That's why you're saying that. No, I'm not putting a Chagovara on there. Let's get serious. I'm going to make the list myself. Okay, then we can just dispense with George Washington and Thomas Payne. All right. The nurse, that's it. I'm right. Thomas Payne, no. No, George Washington, Thomas Payne. That's it. Nobody else can get a lot of response. They went about the actors, the musicians and famous audience. Oh, yeah, people of the right people. But the politicians, I mean, that's a little bit too esoteric. A little bit too cerebral. For our crowd, our crowd just wants to do the audio from Playboy TV and who are we to deny him that? And we like them. Yeah, there you go. See, they're talking. This whole, I can't put it on this hour. Because it's thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, He's going to say the effort. Any minute, you know. And then you'll have to bleep in. We'll have to go through a big song to dance and duffle, come running in. It was that on the air. Greg, it's a four letter word. Greg, you know, all right. So we don't want to have all that hysteria going on there. Especially another we got him calm down. You know, as he wasn't, I mean, I'm not. I would be bad to say it would be an in port taste. What? But at least I'll say this for him. He didn't like losing when Doc Cox when we had the word about him passing away. How do you know? Because he came in and we discussed and he didn't seem to be, I mean, You know, he was sad like the rest of us, but he didn't become an emotional cripple. I think that the fact that he was a close. I have no idea. Well, well, Doc Cox was close to Tanner. Tanner was very close to Cox. And, and duff is very close to Tanner. So it's just he might like rub all of it. I see. It might, it's just my do it. Now let's see. Here's one of his Barbara Simpson is a complete in total Nazi bitch-faced troll and Coder wannabe. So at at least art belt replacing remains less right wing crap on a radio says Lou in well. I don't know. Thank you, Lou. I don't know. That crap. So I have no idea who those people are. Nor I could. Also, it says check out. Here's another fact. Check out the site. Miss leader.org for a daily deconstructing of more of W's lies. Okay. I voted for grandma and your pull, but if God forbid you leave him in his denomity, I would even vote for him if he made getting rid of this disgrace in the oral office.

Back home slot. 85% of young Americans 18 to 24 can identify Iraq Afghanistan or Israel. Any of these. Any of the all of these things on on on mark map. 56% can find the Indian subcontinent. They can't find India. We've been Sri Lanka. 56%. Yes. And 30%. Because I'm turning this that around. I mean to say 70% right. But 30% can identify the Pacific Ocean. I mean in America there's only two that you need to concern yourself with. This one in that one. Yeah. And they can find that. What's that one off there? Just off the afloat of coast. What's that one off to these there? Oh, the Gulf. Or the Indian. Or do you say, Karate. Oh, God. That's America for you can hear it all away up here. But like that. We don't mind up here in Toronto.

The operation by elimination man. A worst luck at charme. 1133-560-WDQ-940 jump on that bandwagon. Yeah. No. I did read this and I thought now would be a propitious time to pass it along because the people need to know. See. Another reason that they're all gone whole for Wersley Clark is because they don't know too much about him. Except he has a big mouth and talk a lot during the war on MSNBC. Right. Of course we know how many people watched MSNBC. I'm turned in the war. And I really was on. Maybe he was on CNN. I think he was on a map. He's always open in the mouth. Not only went a sweet event in Hoover who writes in the uh... nation. Per editorial. Here's an excerpt that somebody actually does they remember a couple days ago. Hmm. Like on Monday. In on June 12, 1999, an immediate aftermath of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, a small contingent of Russian troops, dashed to occupy the Christina Airfield and Kosovo. Clark was so anxious to stop the Russians that he ordered an airborne assault to confront these units in order which could have unleashed the most frightening showdown with Moscow since the end of the cold of the Cold War. War high-purbally you can decide, but British General Michael Jackson, the three-star General and Commander of K-4, the International Force Organization, committed by NATO to enforce an agreement in Kosovo, told Clark, Sir on not starting World War III for you, when refusing to accept his order to prevent Russian forces from taking over the airport. Jackson was rightly worried that any precipitous NATO-action-conversive confrontation with a nuclear armed Russia, and upset the NATO-led peacekeeping plan just getting underway with the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo. Indeed, it is in military circles that Clark's pristine incident was the final straw that led the Pentagon to relieve him of his duties actually be tarim earlier. Clark had also angered the Pentagon, brass, and secretary of defense William Cohen in particular, with his numerous media appearances in repeated public requests for more weapons, and for more freedom to wage the Kosovo war that way he wanted with ground troops. At one point, according to Media Reports, the Defense Secretary Cohen through Chairman of Joint's Chiefs of Staff, he was held in tour Clark to get your effing face off TV. How do you like that? He told Clark to get your effing face off TV. So I don't want to see him be kind of a media hound, maybe a little bit trigger-happy all of these things, but I just something to think about, okay? Before you start jumping in with both feet and getting all excited and whipped up into a frenzy, okay? Okay? Yeah, the whole time we're through pre-em allight commander. Oh, how can you beat that? You can't beat the supreme. So he's got a big leader, he's got 89 votes, Wesley Clark 89, who'd you like to see as the Democratic candidate against W? Howard Dean 64, I don't care they all suck 59, Bob Graham 46, I don't care I'm for Bush 45, 13.1% for Bush for Bush for Bush for Bush for Bush for Bush. In fact, that should be the bumper sticker, lick Bush in 2004, shouldn't it? Okay, I'm putting down. Look, lick Bush more in 2004. Ron Kerry, who looks awfully old and scary, he's got 12, that he got rid of those herpes. Al Sharpton 10, John Edwards 8, the guy that talks to dead people, Dick Gibhardt 4, Dennis Cassinous 3, Carol Mosley-Bron and Julie Reminiich have one out of 342 votes. Don't forget the other pole that'll go up at the end of the show, who's your favorite dead political figure, and so far we've had no, we got Paul Walshdon, that's it. It's just not when it's going over to, because like Motel me, they don't want to hear about dead people. Although lately they're so damn many of them. Gardner Ted Armstrong or whatever hell his name was, and Shib Wally, the purple people leader man, and John Ford's bears for Tippedon, whatever hell what was it in the millionaire? Who? You remember that show? It's before you were in the oven. And you got John Ritter and Johnny Cash Jesus Christ and Don Cox and Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ. Here's a lady from somewhere. Hello. Hi, you forgot to add out the board to that list. There's a, he drafts out the board site. He's not running. We put only people running. But they still might draft some drafts. Let me say it again. We've my lips. We could have put a hell go around. We could have put Hillary Clinton on there. We could have put a lot of people, you know, conjecture that they might run, but so far did not running. So we put only people who are running. Okay. Okay. Have I? I had to. I had to be like a little bit deligimant there because you were going to take no for an answer. But they're considering, you know, the last poll they took the other day showed the Fiddity Fiddity, gore in the bush. Just like we left off a couple of years ago. Fiddity Fiddity. I mean, like that. Oh, Al Gore, man. We don't want him no more. Right? Right? Oh, my God. We have to be an disaster. Oh, no. I don't want to go. I live that they could have stolen the election from, who made it that close after eight years of prosperity and peace. Everybody getting the peace out. Put an Ella Bubba for such a smart guy. You sure wasn't idiot. I don't want Clinton to campaign campaign for me. Yeah, but he did a good job. But it was coal miners, man. Huh? Hey, you have to be a thinking man to pack that Mike's hard lemonade. You're a satchel before you go down in there. You got to think about what are these guys going to want? They've been down here cold and nervous and shaken. I just hard lemonade. That's good to me. And then in Vanneby Internet, right? What? What tell more, could you want? I'm almost inspired to play some Al Gore crap. Now, she's obviously obsessed. She thinks that that's the answer. So how about our gore? No. No. Gore, Al Gore. Ready? Never gore. Or you're a gore. You guys need your nomination. We'll be by-spreadable. This is some crap. I've been watching you during that. I'm not gonna write it on television. And if I could have your silence, I would like to demonstrate for you. The Al Gore version on the market. I или need to gore the hundred Botoranic. The Margarine string is the mother name. We'll be more in a second. We're ready. And you are Alarm, goes off in the morning. Look at the order and one of your children has Russell Here's the C orchestra. morning, Makarana, and one of your children reaches for cereal and fruit, Makarana. Makarana, Makarana, Makarana. Makarana, Makarana. Makarana! This is for 20 o'clock city, with you, a.m. Good very very. We're supposed to just 17, we're supposed to almost 17, we're supposed to six feet on a half. But we'll make them to what my older brother is saying in your head just good. Listen, you should try my God or secret to the God, because your population smells too tall. Oh, don't go close up to it. Let me get home, that'll be me, don't walk. It's my day, yeah, it's my hour. I still, this is me, tough. Just feel the way we don't look today. I still, just grab the insect. I wanna hold your hand. Oh, my, oh, my. Look at him 45 at 5, 60. Oh, my, oh, my. WQM, home of some of the most embarrassing crap in his new broadcast. Speaking of his embarrassing, and I used to turn broadcasting loosely. Yes, Deborah Purollo stopped facking you crazy bitch 20. What's he passionate about? He's passionate about nonsense. Just stuff that you've gotten before. Yeah, stacks and stacks. Hey, Deborah, please, that our facts paper, you psychotic bitch, you idiot. You simple person, you Miguel should be there by now. Wouldn't you think of the shell station point or probably the other way? He said it was raining cats and dudes. Uh, that's gonna like, we don't want to get rained down. I'm gonna rain out our charade. He and our parade. Well, that's not, whatever we get, well, get, you know, somebody will show up, but also they're gonna do. Bring your raincoat, your trench coat, and your rubbers. And bring your rubbers cause Miguel will be there ready for action, right? You wouldn't want to get back. Actually, after, well, he doesn't want to come back any time soon, because he said if he shows up before two, he's got a rimdorine. So, I don't think he'll be back any time soon. Well, you never confused him with the rumored, did you? Oh, my! Oh, my! No, I saw him pick up a check, so I know what they hit him. Oh, my! Oh, my! You're an embarrassment, okay? You're a good guy. I like you. It's nothing personal but my god. And you know something he's perfect for the University of Miami. Here they got a choice between a consummate professional who got screwed over by mobile, by the way. And the dolphin organization. Absolutely. Bill's in for who did out, Yoman work, an excellent job on the dolphins. Nine seasons with a mad dog. And was available to do a U of M football. And the University being the typical bush leg, the end of the... Oh, no, we want to have the same guy doing all of our sports. We want Josie. Oh, my! Oh, my! If it's in perfectly with the entire ambiance of the University of Miami, Donna, no ball, Shalila, and a whole thing over there in the Gables. Makes me want to puke, okay? Donna, you sick idiotic bitch. Oh, that's not disgusting thing. I ever saw it. Get our name off that billboard right away. We've got balls. You got no balls. Honey, although rumors were they had big ones. That's what bubble was saying. Even Josie impressed. Oh, my! Oh, my! Here's the facts from Lisa and North Miami says, What would knowing where your rack is on a map? Two knowing what's really going on in the world because you all read. Proof. Oh, it wouldn't make any easier for anyone if we knew about it or not. I see now why you and George take drugs. Because you can certainly yourself with all that negative crap and it pisses you all off. This has got to be phony. It is. I don't care where your rack is. No, do I want to? I have so much more to say but thought you might not read this. Right phony. This is the same as the, was it Tracy that they did? Yeah. The phony name. Building code compliance. And I asked fake facts. Yeah, another fake facts from a fake Lisa for the y'all. Y'all read y'all got. Hang out of what y'all got Lisa, which probably ain't much. Idiot. 560560 is a, I'm not depressed about anything. I'm wrong. I'm a happy camper. Right. You made. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. It's sloppy. Oh, I'm a little bit upset about the fact. Joseph Gackie is on WQM doing anything. I mean, like I said, nice. Got to have a round. Give me a pay check just to keep him. You know, him is lovely wife to have to eat now. And then. Wesley Clark's got 99 votes. Who'd you like to see is that a credit presidential candidate next year? Wesley Clark 99. 364 votes all told Howard Dean 67. 544 bush 52 13.9%. Oh, Bob Graham 49. John Kerry 13 outsharped in 12. John Edward 11 Dennis Cassinant's Ford. Dick give hearts for. Carol mostly. Ron one Julie women one. See the fact that we got out of this audience almost 14% for bush. That's how it. What about we said he could hold a. I've speech. You could go on national TV on worldwide TV nine o'clock tonight on all the networks. Even on a playboy TV. And look, you're straight in the camera with that goofy look on his face with a furrowed brow and say, I lied to you. All those people who died over there, including the ones who are still dining, including your sons and daughters. I was all for nothing based on a lie. We had this planned long time ago. Me all my neocon pals. And when they were still tomorrow, it's still me 14%. Right. So at times right now, what we were saying about what? What a little bit stupidity. Just like the Arnold business. Oh, it's Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's going to be governor of California, maybe based on what? And then of course, this debate is going to participate in. You'll notice that course it's going to be a little bit on time. We were the election coming up March 4th probably now unless they have changed that. Us the overturned a court's decision. But the fact that a matter is that they have to have the questions in writing. So they can make the answers up for him ahead of time. Because he doesn't have any answers. He doesn't have any positions. He doesn't have any qualifications. But he'd rather pump than come. Work time is not such a bad idea. Pumping them coming in California. Whatever it hell that means. Oh, Jesus God and Christ their motors almighty. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. It's a good thing we got that big one into comedy. But it's already.

On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line, just a wild screaming out of control, maniac. I guess that's supposed to compensate for ability, you know. Hey, last thing. I'm here for it. I'm here for it. Ain't it the same thing? Like the road. A billet. Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello. Hi, you're highlighted at great sensational man. Great. Yeah, I just want to say something. I. And in the segue to some of your talks about the weather and the hurricane and stuff. I. The weather out here on Hollywood beaches. Excellent. Like now. I mean, all. And the weather here in Toronto is beautiful. It's sunny in the 72. I know, but all the local lose, you know, this morning on TV had like there's eight to 10 foot fees and six to eight foot fees and like I'm a lifeguard on Hollywood Beach and the water here is just really flat. There's a little bit of a. A comment running your office out for the beautiful days. All right, that would be just come on out and come on down with a piece of Detroit. Okay. You know, and I, I also tell you, where's the belt on your path? That man that did so much for now. She reports imagine imagine that that happened. If we didn't have to do that for us. I can't even begin to imagine it, you know what? Let's think about that. You know, the ins probably felt the same way about it. Yeah. All right. What do you think? You know, I've got to tell you what you're doing. I'm going to tell you what you're doing. I don't want you to say anything. That's a good thing. I'm not thinking. I said the Hollywood chamber commerce. Well, he's putting in a good plug. You don't want see some naked people out there on the beach. I'm straight. Well, some of them. Maybe some of them not. By who's your favorite dead political figure? We have no interest in this pull and that's okay, cause Eric said, say, I Tony Eric was digging with a show. See, that's an Eric emailed me to say that he got a whole bunch of suggestions on last night on the full. Because he put it on there for people to be able to put in their city. Which I put Bobby Kennedy on there by the way, Eric. way, Eric, I was the one and you put one into, right? So that's, but anyway, by doing that, see that would have been about 30 caused me with a hand from people suggesting is supposed to like do it on a website, so he's Dick and with a program here while making it nice and easy for you now, Eric, so don't interfere, okay? Like Malakoleone said to Santino, don't interfere. Remember that one who haven't dinner with the people he was given, let you do a carlowe about, right? Santino, don't interfere. She knew that, that hot tempered Santino man, they shot him on a causeway. Yeah, fun, call you home. Anyway, let's just play the audio from the gunfather the rest of the three years. I said, that sounds good to me. Huh? We're just gonna play gunfather drop-in. Oh my god, my man! I think you bloody brains will all be in my side, and make sure. It's a moment. I thought you were in the storm, so I know when we're in the frame. You go for my life. You go for my life. Please, good. Take me to the only place. See, this is what pisses all the Sino Mo off real big time. He knows that he knows in a part of his brain, what used to be, what's under the Amoscrath there, the Weasel. He knows that I could actually play Godfather drop certain next to three years, what's ever left on his deal, and still get the gigantic numbers over what he is pathetic, go decimal whatever he's problem. Man, this is what really has got a frost his saddle. I don't get how many day ago getting a walk, grease ball, going by, come out on a one-way. See, and you could play the same drop-in small, but the difference would be nobody would listen when you play it. That's the bottom line. Don't know why I'm with them to make you take your service with them. But justice, we must go to the one-way. That's so ridiculous, Rex. Oh! There you go. That's medley from the Godfather. 560, 0560, pound-560. Your favorite dead political figure, the list we have so far, Paul Wellstone, Thomas Pain, George Washington, Bobby Kennedy, Ablincon, Ablincon, Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King and JFK. That's the list we have so far to which you folks have added one. Right. I mean, see if we had a really cerebral audience, say we say, well James Madison, because he was really, uh, uh, keep dreaming. What? cerebral audience. How about John Quincy Adams? How about him? Like to show? How about James Knox Polk? You Polk? He was kind of Polk's alien, I do believe. And he liked his Polk. A pagan Polk? No, he liked his Polk. Oh, maybe that was Franklin Pierce, who they said like his Polk. Was a Franklin Pierce or James Buchanan? Who was never married? They were always rumors about that that we had a close-up. Because it was one of them. It was in 2014, which was Franklin Pierce or 15 James Buchanan? I think was Franklin Pierce. And there were stories that were rumors, things, friend. 560, 0560, pound-560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello. You know God? Yes sir. By the way, it was James Buchanan. It was the American President. 15th. Really? That was why I said I would know was either him or Franklin Pierce. Right. Hey, you know, did you ever get a chance to read David Hulpersan book or in a time of peace? No. Yeah, that's the book that really details a lot of what went on in the Coastalville battle. And I think it gives a real good balance and a objective view of Clark's role in that battle. The editorial that you read for the nation, I think, gives kind of the one-sided view of some of the depressed manipulation that was going on during that war night. And I think it's fair to say that Clark was going to plain the press to get to bring attention to a lot of the bad things that were going on in the Coastal of the press was not paying attention. OK. I told a lot of the atrocities came out. I mean, I'm not saying he's perfect by the means. And I'm not saying that I'm even, you know, no, I'm not saying that I necessarily believe it, but somebody fasted to me today in the nation. Obviously he's a credible publication and I want to really because I want to put all the stuff out there and then people can pick and choose and believe what they want. Right. And when I'm saying with the Hall of Stembook is basically, I think it presents a very balanced set in the presence of the war to all of the honest with you. I highly recommend it. OK. And also for the, for the poll for the dead politicians, I think I like to know that the person that ran this is the country during the 1980s. Nancy Reagan's astrology, she is dead by the way. OK. And have a great day. Just say, I know. I know. I know. I was actually an anti-sistrology. I figured for him. I said, that's good news. And that was a great call. That was a great call. We're not put that on there. Of course, because we don't know what the name was. Nobody, we know who it was anyway. Just like they don't know where the god damn Indian Ocean is or where India is. Or Sri Lanka is. I always like to say, line, you know, when I was collecting stamps. See, that's the problem. I thought I was learning something about the world that they went and changed. How they changed the names of all the damn countries. Piss me off, man. What the hell was in Bobway? You know, what is that? Whatever happened to the good old Belgian Congo, huh? That was my favorite Congo. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. I'll go. So we can all go to the Congo. How's precious doing, by the way, and the passion she okay? Very good. Love him 57.

Nothing's going to happen to tomorrow morning, but he's standing there like it and his hair blowing all around. You know, just waiting for the big blow. Our lot of guys standing around waiting for the big blow in line. Black says Iraq probably destroyed WMDs. Former UN weapons chief weapons inspector Hans Blitz believes that Iraq destroyed most of its weapons of mass destruction 10 years ago. But kept up the appearance that it had them to the tour of military attack and interview with the Australian radio station broadcast today. Black said it was unlikely that the US and British teams now searching for weapons in Iraq would find more than some documents of interest. Interest. As I know, he used to say, interest. I'm certainly more and more of the conclusion that Iraq has as they maintain the destroyed all most of what they had in the summer of 91, Blitz told Australian broadcasting corp radio. The more time that his past tomorrow think it's unlikely that anything will be found he be saying. Blitz indicated he's helped the US let coalition at Baghdrak on the issue of Iraq's weapons. In the beginning they talked about weapons concretely and later on they talked about weapons programs. Maybe they'll find some documents of interest he said. Is that like persons of interest like Steven Hadfield? We got persons of interest and I would got documents of interest. I mean you can put a sign up on your door beware of the dog without having a dog he said from his home in Sweden. Good point, Hans. By the way, Lee, Pete, whatever, at Yorkert, Yorkert, the girls team in Finland and Helsinki last night, five to three anybody care? No, I wonder if that game's on again. You think they keep replaying it like over and over going to leave Stevie? It is Robertson of the corner to New and Knight. New and Knight circles back to the blue line to Wade Vela. Vela has it hooked off of his stick. Why? Never signed a better Joe my good friend the great Joe Bowling man. See the best or what? Even George knows he's the best. Who? Oh, and by the way it's a good thing we don't have Josh Friedman on our staff anymore to go bother Joe Bowling for more promos. He's a very smart level. It's so great it's just a... This is Joe Bowling the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs. They don't come any better than Neil Rogers. Thanks Joe. What's upon a time tax box orifice? My good buddy Johnny Depp. I mean everybody also in the station drops names all the time. What else should I have? If I have to hear one more time for Reltown this about how he was with Mad Dog at that dolphin kick off the lunch web or whatever the thing was yesterday. How many times did he say that this morning? About third man. Man I love his Scott but just a cool little bit with that eye eye eye eye eye eye eye uh huh you know what I'm saying what he's saying. I'm saying that he says that maybe I love it too much. Right. You be mean by about a half a half a beat. What's this important thing coming over from chronic Jane? She says I liked Howard Dean but now I want Wesley Clark. He was first in his class in West Point. He was a Rhodes scholar like Brooklyn and he was a professor of economics at West Point. He knows how to handle the military. I think a Clark Dean ticket will be ideal or Clark Graham ticket but you know Graham's unheard of. Right. Love percentage but he has a snowball's chance in how you're about that Jane. Please check out www.mesleater.org. The documenting pushes lies. Somebody else facts that already. I'll let check it out. Like that one I checked out yesterday was good to read that one about what was it? What was it? I don't know. Some would have the anti-religion stuff but there was nothing there we could use but it was good. It was all the anti uh babbling crap. Anyways, as there's a channel on satellite TV called Link that is something interesting. He shows about the world and is non-profit. Link.org. So it's Jane and for Lord of Chronic Jane. Thank you Chronic Jane. Anyway, I get back to Johnny Depp important thing. Could you? Nobody cares about the fact that we have a bunch of functional literates who have no idea what. See, this is the thing about Americans because education system is such crap. Americans because of the geographic isolation think they can be comfortably ignorant. They know nothing about the rest of the world. I'm like almost any place else where they're very familiar with the rest of the world. Generally because most of the area in place else they're close to the rest of the world. Comfortably dumb. Although the Canadians here I don't know to say why they know so much about the rest of the world because the only thing they're close to was like the North Pole and the US. And yet the education system here is heads and shoulders. heads and shoulders above the USA? How do you like that? Johnny Depp has made another transformation it says. Oddball acted to box off his money maker. The star known for playing eccentric and cult favorite such as Edward which is so much too long. And fear of loading in Las Vegas is establishing himself as a major box off his draw with two films this week into the top five. Once upon a time in Mexico, as opposed to once upon a time in America which lasts for about seven and a half hours, once upon a time in Mexico staring at Tonyo Bandarist's a Murariachi musician gunslinger. And Depp is a sleazy CIA agent. They viewed in first place with $24 million of Queen industry estimates on Sunday. It was Johnny's second consecutive number one debut after the summertime hit Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the Black Pearl which shorts of the movie South but Johnny was good. Pirates still performing strongly in its tenth week of release came in number five at 4.6 Mayan so in other words Johnny Depp is in two of the top five money making films of the week. Number one and number five in the same weekend. It says for any actor that's great and for Johnny Depp it's totally unexpected and welcome. Depp has had blockbuster's before such a sleepy hollow, chocolate, and modest hits like Edwards his orhands and Donnie Brasco but they've been few and far between the respected but little scene called films like Dead Man, Edward, Benny, and June and Furin loving in Las Vegas. I forgot did you say you ever finally saw Donnie Brasco? All right, Donnie Brasco is great. You should make me man, that's outstanding flick. We need to start talking about movies again. I know, and this is not. You want to know well though, the reason being that it inspired me to watch so many good ones and now that we don't talk about it, I've got about a half dozen of the other room I haven't even watched yet. Well, get to it. I haven't watched the snatch. Oh, snatch is good. Oh wait, and the movie too. Yeah. Oh and you which reminds me now maybe this is the hour when I can actually put some audio on here in the background. Yeah, maybe. Oh, now what I just saw. Whoa, if you could have seen what I just saw. That's what I didn't instrument. That's it, man. No you haven't seen that. But listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Oh, look at the watch though. She had was her name. What if her name was Chrissy? Chrissy, don't just because it ended in SSY. Yeah, don't get all bent out of shape. Okay. Don't get Chrissy about it. Don't get Chrissy and don't be a Sissy. Okay, it was just the Chrissy. She was just having a little fun. Hit the exam. I don't, I just don't dare. Yeah. We have the dump. Now what was the movie with the the spikurola with Johnny Depp? Oh, that was Crybaby. Crybaby. Oh, oh, what do we even put that on? Roodle. Because it's so embarrassing. Very soon. Yeah. Anyway, Johnny Depp are Hallendale or Miramar. We're going to help was a boy who used to what's a pot of time. He was out on his luck down on his luck. Slutton is car actually, at one point. Many, many moons ago. And now he's a big star. This is a great story. This is from the Affudge Report. Miss Fudge had this on this morning. Oh, Mack Washington. You know where that is? More or less. You do? I might have been there. I never heard of it. Well, I never been in Washington State. So I don't know what that is. Anyway, O'Conna Gondick County Sheriff's deputy seeking a person on an outstanding warrant broke down the door to the wrong home. And then jolted a man with a taser in front of his wife and child. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sounds like a soft floor to things, don't it? Oh, yeah. That happens there all the time. Sheriff Frank Rogers says the bottom line is officers messed up as what he said. No one was seriously injured. The incident. The heavily armed officers apparently burst into the wrong trailer at the host at the Trader Park in O' Mack. That's not home. The Lord's all homes that Washington. The man they were seeking 30 year old Joseph Emma Paruisian. He heard the Ruckus and tried to escape from another trailer. He was arrested without incident. He heard the Ruckus. Much of love that word, the Ruckus. So he fits right in with trailer parks and stuff like that. We're not knocking anybody out there. Listen to trailer park just because they called you trailer trash. Don't take it personal all the way. I think they might have a point. And who? And let me ask you this, who picks up the trailer trash? The trash people. Probably the promoter of the promotion department for Jerry Springer, I would think. Pick up the trailer trash. Paul or my off to Chicago. We're going to let you shoot that show. Oh, there's the hurricane. Here's the latest on EZML. They should know we have strategic supply. Oh, look at it. It's the cheese head. Throughout the United States. Tommy Thompson. Oh, they've kept him in a closet for a long time. It was in the particular areas. He drank water out of a creek. To move very fast. Who didn't? What's so important to do the pre-planning which work? By the way, how are they doing? I don't want to change the subject. But how are they doing and investigation about the. I can't find it now about the. And trash. Yeah, we got some of the contracts back in there. I'm almost at the wrong one. Perfect. Don't do that. Have they got the guys who sent the. And trash? You're a man yet? No, just so interested person. They got the first of interest. But other than that, we got any more clues about the. And trash now. Yeah, we're doing just as well as on that as we are doing a fighting Osama, Yamama and Saddam and Mullah Bola and the woolly bully and all these people. We found Shebboly and he's dead. That said, sad, you know. I didn't know he was 82 though. That's not all that old. I'll tell you. You start getting to be in your 60s like me. You start seeing any any number you pick. Oh, 100. That's not that old. Well, that's just the way you have to look at it. You know, the old one of the world 90. That's not so old. Just so you know, yes, the record right now is 116. She's still kicking. I we have it on our website. Oh, I'm sorry. Japanese lady, I have it on a website. I'm so far ahead of you, man. You have no idea. I scour. I scour the wicked worldwide web.

And who could blame him? I know I'm laying out. Clark says his career has plunged into the presidency. So the audience so far seems to be very astuped, at least he would think so. Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Commander told CNN he'll kick off his run for the Democratic Presidential nomination, with an announcement today, which we already knew that. This is what my expertise, my leadership experienced, my whole career has put in prepared me for Clark said in an interview with CNN's American morning on Wednesday morning today this morning. I've had a lot of diplomatic experience. I've done a lot of work with security policy. I think I'm the best person to look at the future of this country and keep us safe. Clark 58 becomes the tenth Democrat seeking to once he president Bush. He's a West Plung graduate road scholar, former CNN, and I see I told it wasn't, uh, I was wrong. We're CNN. That's why everybody saw him. Former CNN military analyst who led US and allied forces in NATO's 1999 air war in Kosovo asked about the fact that he never held elective office. He said his move is ambitious, but also his extraordinary era. Questioned about how he can market himself and his campaign without a record on domestic issues, Clark said on Wednesday that he has the same experience that everybody else does when it comes to grappling with the issue as a citizen. He said he worries about health care, education, unemployment other life issues as voters do. He said when he was in a military he dealt with quality of life and personnel issues such as housing education and health care for our people as what he said. He's responding to comments that he was abrasive and not well-liked by others in a military Clark said the environment was competitive. It's a competitive bureaucracy, he said, people at a rate at the bottom they come out at the top. There's a lot of gossip in some sharp elbows, no, but I think my record stands on its own merits. And if you look at what I've done, the contribution to the made it's a very solid record, I'm proud of what he said. And you'll notice the Arkansas connection here? Is there? And the fact that Bubba and Hillary and the other Clinton connections are people who are now as advisors and Bubba supposedly pulled some strings behind the scenes. You know this? Uh-huh. There you go. So far, Wesley Clark, who would you like to see as domestic as Democratic presidential candidate next year? Wesley Clark's leading the pack by good margin to 112 Howard D. 85. I don't care they all suck 80. I know care I'm voting for Bush, 59, 13% for Bush. Idiots.

Yes, sir. How you doing? I just want to share one of my memorable Cox moments. Can I say Cox on the radio? I guess I can. Yes. Back back in the Miami-Vice era when he hijacked the radio station and just played plug-in as soon as I was out first. I wonder if anybody would've met before hours. It's a nice place. I'll be there. Yeah. I just can't put in. Remember these colors like drowning underwater. There are in and out. They're in and out and all of it. They even like drowning over there. I don't know what it is.

I told you they ran out of a tier a lot of sudden right at noon when the little handed the big hand that was it. That was the time to put on the goddamn leaf scheme. I told you to be a hell of a lot more entertaining. Oh, and you're in a commercial break. Let's do Miami. When is this? Hello. Yes, sir. Neil, I just wanted to tell you, I'm 33 years old. I'm Cuban American one way to head into that in Bible thing for the last 10 years of my life. But both republished and wrapped up, I changed the democratic, this guy Clark, he excites me. I think everybody that there's a no the difference. They should listen to the guy who's doing it. I mean, the guy makes sense on everything he talks about. I think the fact that he's an outsider will give us some fresh blood into into the old, you know, GOP and the good old boys mentality in there. And I hope anybody that has a clear vision, it can really sit down and really look at the values that this guy has because he's going to be an exposer. You think so, huh? Definitely, Neil. How many times have you seen a military guy forced our general, and that the last, you know, be a Democrat and speak so intelligently about things? But that just makes sense. He makes sense about everything he talks about. I said to my wife a number of times, when I used to see him on CNN as a commentary as one of their host, I said, it's only this guy would run through president and, you know, God was listening. God was listening. I think, yeah, God was listening, right. Okay, good luck to Paul. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He said, God was listening. How do you like that? He's hearing listening to Pat Robertson because that's through. I think it's going to wipe out Virginia beat. Oh, right. Second now. It just took a little rock and roll there to the right. Look at that. Which would allow for some strengthening. Yeah, see? Oh, I think Pat Robertson drew the Lord's attentioner and, and maybe he misunderstood. Okay, maybe God's got like a little hearing problem today. Like what's your name? Like Mrs. Wallace on passions. Maybe he's hearing aid fell out. And he thought Pat Robertson is saying, please, please send that right here to Virginia beat right over my ass would be good. That's what he was asking God to do. And I think God might just fulfill his wish with the big blow. 5605056. On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. And the best part of the whole deal is that the media continues taking these people seriously and presenting them like some kind of respectable significant, yeah. Jerry Faldball and Jimmy Swagger and Pat Robertson and all these other grave robbers. I guess Pat's a little bit upset about Charles Taylor. You know, I can't make no more diamond deals in Liberia. Here's Tamarack, hello. Tamarack. I think Tamarack floated away. Let's try Boca, hello. Media, how are you today? Pretty good, sir. I heard the hours in the old con business last week and I heard Sean Hannity's radio show on WABC. How do you personally guess? The biggest right wing at the whole in the history of the world. You were talking about, he said except for Boca, Riley, him and Rush Rumbleb. There was no intelligence operator in the United States that they should say that the all of a bunch of pinko, Democratic left-winged fanatics. How do you know that? And Boca, would you wish to tell Mr. Wanssel like that? I was flipping. He said that I would drove off the road. I mean, he's even bigger, I mean, he's even bigger fast as you've ever heard. I know, he's not the biggest he's what I'm know. I would just to see what I was saying. They said he has the best ratings in New York to bend. I'm any radio show. Well, come down. Just be glad you don't live in New York. Okay, I am. 560, 505, 60, by the way, speaking of ratings, those trends come off to Marlman's going to be this rinkle up dried up old fag, man.
