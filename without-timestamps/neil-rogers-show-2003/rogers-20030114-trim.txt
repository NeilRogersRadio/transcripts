Get on your thinking caps. Now, the CEO made a comment about Peter Townsett was that PD Lenny that made the comment. Let's have him peek, because we didn't discuss it. Now, see, I'm not, I'm not one of those who jumps to conclusions. And since he claims that he turned the information over to police ahead of time, and told him that he was researching this autovide graphical thing about his being abused as a child, I'm a little bit reluctant to like jump on a bad way until he find out what that was really going on. Because how could anybody be that stupid? You know what I'm saying? I mean, realize there are a lot of stupid people and a lot of these rock artists who have been to many drugs. Much of the people around here. But we'll also reserve judgment on good old Pete Townsett. Who? Who's your favorite all-time favorite dead recording artist, where I was going to say, and of course Elvis, you think Elvis and I have had big in our crowd. Not at all. Now, Elvis claws maybe, but they're kind of hostile toward Elvis. Every time we do a poll that involves Elvis, it's kind of like, to him. Janice Jopflin, John Lennon, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Roy The Boy, Roy The Boy, Oh, Jim Morrison, although I do like his cafeteria a lot. Jimi Hendrix, Morris Gibb, and I'm putting Morris Gibb on there because he just died over the weekend, but I have a feeling since he was a member of a group. Right. I mean, Jim Morrison was a member of a group. Most of these people are members of a group, but I mean, he was like one of several correct. Morris Gibb, Marvin Gaye, which I'm sure you won't vote for since you don't like Marvin Gaye. I do like, but you don't want anything that's gay. You like it. Run away from it. See? And Jim Crochi. I'll decide out of mind. He probably won't get too many votes either, but he and I wish I would have brought him a Jim Crochi album of the best of. Bad, badly, royal brownster operator. Jim Crochi was great. No problems with Jim. But, you know, right. Yeah, I think it's a narrow way. Well, he was around that long. He was a part of it. What do you die from? Uh, I'm not sure. Something. Something not good. Plain record, something? No, I don't think so. Oh, it's making a plane record. There's, um, buddy, Holly. What's wrong with me? Sorry, Eric. A big bop. Barry, Barry. Oh, Eric's the guy that don't like you. Buddy, Holly. That's put that on Eric. Buddy, Holly, please. Well, the big bopper doesn't belong on her. Are you crazy? Your favorite recording artist is the big bopper in Shantilly, Lace. That was the only song you ever recorded, I think. Did anybody remember his plane crash? Jim Crochi. Oh, so sorry, Jim. And you know who else? In this crowd, I don't know. We got a lot of fun. No, no, no, no. John, then we got the same plan. Play balance. That is the same plan. Play crash with buddy, how many big bopper? Yeah. Does he belong on there? Which he valents now? La Bomba. Didn't do anything for me. La Bomba? Yeah. I think the timing is good, huh? La Bomba? I hope that W is listening. La Bomba does every any bells with the W, huh? Oh, yeah. So there we go. So buddy, Holly is at a door list. Jim Crochi, down a plane crash, I'll be damned. What a show. Oh, yeah. I mean, I don't want to take requests in here. Somebody, yeah. Go ahead. But Frank Sinatra. Who, yeah. We agree on that one too. Ah. Okay, Frank Sinatra, Eric. I hope you're listening. Hope you're not busy with those of breakfast burritos. That's already after 9 o'clock. He gets a five o'clock start with those. Wait about now he's thinking about brunch. So we added buddy, Holly and Frank Sinatra to that short list that I gave you. And I'm sure that our audience look at the phones, or we're going to also hook to get lots of others. How about Dean Martin? No. Curie, David, student. Curie, come on. No. How about treaty Lopez if I had a hammer's he alive? I hope not. Now that's bad. See you soon. Remember treaty Lopez? No. Lemon. Tree. He did the, uh, uh, uh, Mary soon. Yeah. But he jazzed him up a little bit. You know, like a Latino beat. I see. You don't never heard a treaty Lopez? Well, I've heard a treaty Lopez, but you know, I'm a good guy. I've connected him with the songs. And already the audiences informed us about Jim Crochie down in a plane crash, which we're very sorry to hear that, but nevertheless. I guess they didn't make any difference. You thought we were going to say? Right. He still dead. That's after nine at five, 60 WQA. And we got the mad dog at one today. Hank is doing a show at the mommy heat. Gee, I hope we're should feed them instead of every hercing for the nation. Lantham. Especially during the middle of Hank show. That'll be the end of that. Seven o'clock. We got the big. Oh, he's doing a show from the senior bull, which I'd be very honest. Also, I'd have heard of the senior bull until today. Carlos filled me in. He said it's all the kids who aren't good enough to play in the. All star, uh, the East West game, the snorts out, the shriner is that whatever. Purb shriner. Uh, the big go to an issue of seven and ten of these senior bull. Any k from g a ten to two and overnight it's Joe and Mark.

Scratcher balls and five, everything's okay. And we've got a new USA. Don't let's march. Don't come back now here. 9-16 at 5-60 WQA, a section of Tampa International Airport was evacuated yesterday. After the airport baggage screening system detected a mouse trap in a piece of luggage. A mouse trap. The airport's ticketing area was evacuated for about 45 minutes, but the Tampa Police bombed squad found no explosives in the bay. It did retrieve a mouse trap from inside a coffee can, said Chris Radigan, a spokesman for the TWAA, T Transportation Security Administration. When you looked at the monitor, it had all these wires and looked very, very suspicious, she said. Airport spokeswoman Brenda Gaye, a geogagagagaggan, said the bag's order was talking with the police airport, and TSA officials the owner was not in charge, she said. She said a few planes from over five airlines had 20 to 30 minutes delays, but didn't have an exact number. Now, strap. First of all, why would you carry a mouse trap in your luggage? Maybe you need it where you're going. See, Christine Agalera? Huh? What's wrong with that? Gotta carry a build a better mouse trap. So we've also had some more additions to our survey. Although I noticed George says nobody's on a phone now, because they all aiming in people called in shouting names out, that's not the way we do it on this show. We nice have a little verbal intercourse with some of you who have some ideas about some of these people, as opposed to just calling up like a hit and run artist. Like, what was the one that I didn't put that mother several on that puttin down? The ones that amputtin down, buddy Holly, Frank Sinatra, Freddy Mercury, another queen. Jerry Garcia, and Rick Nelson, how could we have forgotten Rick Nelson? Love Rick Nelson? Love Aussie and Harriet, they're both dead. Boy, a lot of dead people, you know? And more every day. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T, and Verizon Ruralis Lossomirty, great news. It's Tuesday, it's the 14th of January, which means a small build in a new episode. Now is it really a two hour special thing? Was it somebody just make that up? Oh no, I don't know, I'll check. Well, let's check that out. When it's out, let's check it out, come on. A two hour special small, Bill Manky, New Imagine. Get out the extra big box of Kleenex. Man, oh man. So Michael Mayo steals a collar right on the show yesterday. Wow, in today's this unsentinel. It's on our website, by the way, or we'll be momentarily, so this carlos gets through a showering and doucheying in there. Now go in to take a leak at about eight, twenty five this morning in the AT-ROOM, and this carlos in there in the sink. His whole body is in the sink, he's got the water running full blast, he's showering in the sink, shaving and doucheying at the same time. Kind of like an all in one deal. Maybe they can develop a deal like that, where you're like a chamber, like a gigantic toilet like thing. And what you do is you just get in it and the water like, it does everything or one, like a shower, like a shower, like a toilet, like a shower, like a toilet. It takes you shower, take a dump, and doosh all at the same time. I think it's a station station. Wow, this is WQM, your sanitation station. Oh, we're trying to clean up our act. Aren't we? No, no. So Michael Mayo writes, don't tell me their facts is coming on this stuff, because you ought to see some of the names coming in like Frank Zappa? Frank Zappa, wasn't it? Oh, get outta here. Frank Zappa wasn't a recording artist like in the sense of recording artist. He was a comedian. He killed the well. Oh, no, Virgin Mary, seen on picture window and Canada. Oh, hey, do you see this? I didn't see that. I think that it's an old man, man. I think that the second coming is coming. Oh, let's get rid of that call from Hylia, okay? Hylia, hello. Hey. Yeah, I'll be going. Okay. Jim Crow cheated time in a bottle too. Right. And Karen Carpenter, I think, is one of the sugar. Oh, Karen Carpenter, excellent choice. Love you. Thank you. Yeah, it's going to be good call from Hylia. They're always great. Karen Carpenter, Eric, I'm sorry about this, but we did, you know, just a, we're not sorry. You missed a whole bunch of names anyway, so we'll just, I'll look all and turn the break. You're going to one? I will call him during the break to catch him up. What do you mean, you missed a whole thing? He was all taking a dump or something. Take it at your job. You can't imagine Eric doing something discussing like that. I can imagine Carlos doing that. Would he put in Mary's stories on the site? Okay, what just, just relax a little bit. Okay, just take it easy. Slow down, little bit. We got four long excruciating hours to butcher here today, so just, just take it easy. This isn't exactly like yesterday's show where we can fill in with all that music. Although, although, I'd appropriate thing to do. It certainly would be appropriate to remember give us some memories. All I don't have any music here. Like all my doors stuff is up in Toronto. Do we have any doors music here now? Mike Vattler, back in, uh huh? But might have some, uh, like I got compilation discs. Greatest hits of this and that. We might have some of them. So I'm talking about playing the doors for four hours today, although, hahahaha. I mean, who we got on their Elvis? We certainly have an Elvis. I saw one disc back there. It's somebody didn't steal yet. John Lennon, we got every Beatles song that was ever invented. I imagine George Harrison. Do we have any George Harrison? Yeah, we did. Back there. Remember after he died, we had that thing back. Of course, I'm not assuming that they're all still here. Roy Orbison must play Roy Orbison today for hours. Jim Morrison, like I said, Jim and Henry. We don't have no Jimmy Hendrix. We got purple haze. I don't know what I got. Can I need George? I'm Judy Garland. Judy Garland would be good. He did a lot of drugs. How about he holly and a lot of booze? Buddy Holly never did any drugs that we know of. Buddy Holly. He was kind of like clean cut Yahoo, all American, uh, red, neckie, uh, what a nasty glasses and he's dead. Jim Crochi, we don't have that here. I got it home. Maybe tomorrow we'll do that. Ha ha ha ha. Sounds like a plan to me. Frank's enough for us. No, Frank's enough for music. Sorry. We got some Frank's enough for Pyrrty's. What do you got there? Not Frank's enough for. So, Ben Crozby. Oh, Ben Crozby's even better. And he's also dead. Let's put him on there. Just a joke. So here are the names that I added on there, which you shouldn't have to buddy Holly. Frank's enough for a Freddie Mercury. Jerry Garcia. Rick Nelson and Karen Carpenter. Please, Karen. Maybe a little salad would be good. Maybe the one that's Gloria Woddy and all in the family. The one that Archie keeps screaming. How about a little salad? Come on, Gloria. Boy, she a pig or what? Sally's brothers. You used to like Sally's brothers when she was on their show. And as soon as that show went off here, I turned to despise her net. As soon as the show went off as also when she got bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- or bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- bl- How do we want to look at it? A cow. A lot of fat bras on TV, you know that? Rosie O'Donnell, Roseanne, Oprah, Sally's brothers. Start Jones on the view. Oh my god, she's not fat. She's not another category. Fat. Have you seen her shoot commercials for Payless? Well, how she find her shoes? I guarantee she don't tie no shoes. You notice women don't tie shoes anyway? Oh, you know what I have to wear now? I went to my podiatrist yesterday. By the fact, sir, a lot of women are the best, baby. Even though the panties are just getting annihilated, we can't pick. I remember for that he ain't playing. All those pretty soon they might sign them up. But his doctors are the best. Went to my podiatrist yesterday. I've got a bonespar. Heelspar? Not a big deal. But I've got to file it. Saw it. I've got to file it off for the nail file. But, so you know, one of the many things he did. By the way, thanks again, Doc, you're great. One of the many things that he recommended. Shoes with high heels. He said, he recommended boots. I'm not going to be wearing no cowboy boots. Can you imagine me wearing cowboy boots? Yeah, Carl said, oh yeah. Yeah. But I'm thinking like maybe high heels. Like pump shirt pumps, right? Pumps it would be good. See, I mean cowboy boots. It clashes with my image. But I'm thinking more like, well, you know, they have some school marshes. The nice and square toe. Oh, yeah. But the heels on them. Maybe I've been brought some of those from my mouth. I'll get a bit of a size three foot. I'll just squeeze them on, you know, just get the old shoehorn and shove it in there. Siding some images of the virgin Mary on windows and walls in the northern reaches of the Canadian Province of Saskatchewan, have produced a minor tourism miracle for the remote villages involved. Exactly. My thoughts precisely. Since September mysterious images of Mary mother of Christ have been reported in four villages three of which are accessible only by airplane. Well, you know, she don't need a plane to get where she's going. Spurring hundreds of people to visit. How do you like that? The virgin Mary insists, catcha once. She finds the most bizarre places. She's the Christ. The latest images appeared yesterday on two homes in Bolville, Saskatchewan, which has fewer than a thousand residents. See, she'd a lot of be like an in Times Square. She'd a lot of be like in some place. She wants to go into the, uh, boom docks. Like in clear water on the side of that bank building. The images appeared to glow at night. And it would capture on video, said birthed derosure, who owns one of the homes. Don't release Nileo. I'm sure. Derosure said she didn't want to tell others about the image under picture window. It would first, I told my mom and she said, Oh, you're probably seeing your own shadow. So I thought people wouldn't believe me. Derosure told writers. Since then, more than 300 people have come from hundreds of miles around to view her window. It was just glowing so beautifully. I had tears in my eyes. Derosure said, adding she believes the sightings are some kind of divine message. Maybe they're from. Oh, good. But the Roman Catholic archbishop of the Keywoodton Diasi's home to the four communities was the way I'm retreating, unable to comment. A spokesman at his office said that I see his not received any official reports of the sightings. Sightings of the images of Christ, Mary, and saints are not uncommon around the world. And it would be what is the media's diverse glass, water, a burrito, and a Cameroom muscle car. Oh, yeah. I would have thought he would have showed up in the Corvette. By the way, mad dog, that was my Corvette you were talking about. It's not white, it's silver. Did you know mad dog is colorblind? No, he was asked me, is that who's the white Corvette? Is that don't answer snappy cars and mine is silver? What is a white one, don't it? It wasn't any white one, it was mine. Huh? He's colorblind. Everything he sees has got like either Aquan Orange or it's out there that Michigan blue. Everything he'd be the color guy. Possibly the most recent famous Canadian sighting was a Christlike image on the brick wall of a Tim Horton's donut shop at Brassda Or on Canada's Aladacost in 1998. Oh, man, I bet he was there with Tim getting signatures for Doug McLean. Where's the other way around? You think? Let's call up what's your name in Washington and find out what's your name at the hockey writer? That broad Rachel Alexander. Very good, oh my god, let's hear it for George. She had really large breasts. Rachel Alexander who had a gigantic pair of hooters, which is why George members are very vividly, but wouldn't know a hockey puck if you stuff the whole bunch of men between her breasts. Rachel Alexander, bow-wow-be-kow-kick. Rachel bow-wow-be-kow-kick. And she got promoted. And what do we got? We got Mike Russo and David J. Neal. Of course you got promoted, did I mention? Big breasts. Well, that seems to work a lot of places. 27 after 9 at 560 WQMs snow and Miami unbelievable Tom Limit and Joe Prieto are buried. Now this is early in snow at the buried in cars. The fact that we have said how it ponds the exomity cars there's no place to park them. Even Tom Limit and a park car in his driveway and probably won't bring them back. So need to place one in yours. Hell it is blowing out all the new vehicles regardless of profit. That's what they're saying now when and out were blown it out.

He has written composed over 400 original songs. He spoke out against band government, campaign for prostate cancer research. He conducted voters' registrations at all his concerts. And generally spoke his mind through music about the entire human condition. Please add him to your list. Thank you for your consideration. Well, I mean, that's so polite. Thank you for your consideration. How can we refuse? So not only we put him on the list, but we also played Bobby Brown. He could be going down. So the list is growing like crazy. Now I know it. Let's see. We've added buddy Holly. Frank Zepa from just adding the ones that I had fast Eric. A lot of votes on there already. John Lennon's got 17. Frank Zepa's got 17. Jimmy Hendrik 16, Elvis 10. See what I mean about Elvis everybody else in single digits. Pulls up, but we're adding to it. Not done yet. Freddie Mercury. Get these Eric. Jerry Garcia. Rick Nelson. He won't do that well, but he should. Boy, he's got a lot of competition. That's a slight. Kieran Carpenter. We can play some carpenter today. What do you... No, no. Thank you. And here's some other one. Kurt Cobain. How could we have left him off of there? Huh? Kurt Cobain. Little insane. And a lot of pain. Not no more. And Frank Zepa, we just put him on there. So there's the list that's expanding. Even as I sit here on my Fed ass. So one out of 100 here on this faction. And to bed it says, I can't believe you love Kurt Cobain off list. Well he's on there now. Okay, just calm down. What about the guy from Millie Vanilly who killed himself? The guy from recording artists. Not lip syncers recording artists. And then it says, what about David Lee Roth? He may not be dead, but his career is. That's cute. That's a whole other category. Okay. So we'll like I said one out of 5,000 eighths at that. Did I finish my story about the Virgin Mary on the picture window in says, Guys, you want to not try to finish that? Yes, I did. Oh yeah, the Tim Horton Donut shop. I'm candid as Atlanta coast of 1998. He sure gets around at Virgin Mary. And I might have to play that momentarily. Well, Virgin Mary. And the best part of the whole deal is that they're actually assholes out there who believe this stuff. That's the most frightening part of it. Okay. Oh my goodness. It's the Virgin Mary on the side of our bank building. It's the Virgin Mary on top of a Totino's pizza. It's the Virgin Mary inside of a double burrito supreme with extra beans from Taco Bell. How do you like that? I wonder. And today is the 14th. We missed the yesterdays. It's an only on Friday to 13th or 13th of every month. We don't hear about it no more. So must be out of business 13th of every month supposedly. That Rosa Lopez has had Hollywood. She's got a date every year. Every 13th of every month lucky 13 lucky for Rosa. All the way. I guess not lucky anymore. She used to have all the whole block blocked off with people parking there to come and watch. Wait for the Virgin Mary on the 13th of each month. Rosa Lopez in Hollywood. But I guess she's small potatoes now. Now that Virgin Mary is making the two up there in Canada. Probably heard that I hang out there every now and then. Probably looking for me. Right here. Right over here. Bitch. Oh, that was bad. You can't call the Virgin Mary a bitch. Can't you just did? I just did. So Michael Mayo writes a column totally cold from this show. Playing hooky to remember a forgotten voice about my cranary. Better late to never mic. It's about time you wrote something. Although it's still pretty crappy column. Bank of the sports page. Mike, you know, tell those people over there to sunset and we'll pull me back right along. I know a little bit about sports not too much, but certainly writing these kind of like human interest or whatever this is. I don't know what you call it. Anybody have any idea what we call this column that Mike Mayo writes in the sunset every day. But anyway, I guess I better do the break first and we'll get to that. It's not all that long. It's Mike deserves it. Any points out who's actually what I've been saying about how they only give like a just a cursory. Uh, acknowledgement to his death. And I guess he wasn't no more Morris Gib, which is what Mike Mayo points out. And then what I just said the other day, yes. Nice going Neil. Thank you very much. The check better be in the mail, Mike. Steel and columns off of this show. He does mention me and Hank in there briefly. That we were at IOD. That's the only coverage we get on the year and this and the news meeting. Any more is the fact that, you know, we used to be an IOD. Not that we're here now or anything to do with our shows now or anything about our lives now or anything at all, but just, well, they used to be an IOD. Back when they were good. Back when we liked them. Now they're on QAM so automatically we despise them. You know what I think they started despising us? I think back in about March of last year. You know what happened here in March of last year? No, what? Well, let me give you a, uh, a clue. Okay. A short clue to what happened here last year. Last year. Yeah, he came here last March and that's when the whole world seemed to like turn on us. All of us. Even a mad dog. I heard a call on his show. They have it here. That guy who called and said, uh, I heard you're going to be going out vacation sometimes soon. Mad dog. And then know that was a, and it guy says, well, we're hoping you will because a lot of us out here don't like you. Even the mad dog. What's not to like? Okay. Just because he went to Michigan. Just because he's a home or which we like. You know, we're almost, huh? We love the mad dog. And this guy see even somebody as in not few ways and it's just a sports guy. I, beloved by almost everyone. And this prick out there. Oh, well, a lot of us out here hate you like poison and we're hoping you're on vacation permanent. This town man evil. If the president wants to find evil doors, he doesn't have to go to North Korea or Iraq or Iran or any of those places. I just got to do this come down here. His brother can give them the guy to tour. Show them all these evil doors we got here. In fact, he can come right to this building. We'll show him we'll put him in the right direction. We know where that studio is. We'll show him an evil door. Gay. Shut up. Silly old Coo. Twenty-till ten and five. Not like the word Coo. Sounds like Cooter. Don't get carried away. I'll think I called him Coo. Not Coo. Coo. Twenty-before ten and five sixty. WCU. I better do the right spot. You know, I'm just I'm having different I don't know why. Maybe it's because Carlos brought me the log about two minutes till ten till nine. Whatever was. Now he was okay. He was just busy dozing in the tea room there for so long. You got to late start. Plus it took an hour and a half to get here this morning. There was a wreck somewhere and Muff was belly-a-king about it took her like forever to get here. I don't want to hear excuses. Okay. I want to see you like what? You know what I'm saying? We're here on time every day. Unlike Marvin the Romain. I got to thank him for that. Thank you. Marvin. I'm giving you a good lesson that if you don't show up like I'm time to do a show that starts at nine or ten or more and you probably ain't going to be around too long. So thank you very much Marvin the Romain. You idiot. You jackass. You turn coat. Thanks for the whammy gig too Marvin. The nice job on that. You know when you shop for quality footwear does a great store where they have the best selection in town. They have the best professional service people really know your feet inside and out. Even if they have to put up with the aroma. And they've got the best unbeatable prices which is why so many people keep going to Brandeys over and over and over again. We're not talking about off name brand shoes. There's some shoes stores that say oh we got shoes for like five bucks. And you walk in there and you see these crappy looking shoes that nobody ever heard of before the brand names. At Brandeys they've got the top names in a business like rock ports, floor shimes, S.A.S. Spiries, Timberl and Naturalizer and lots more for all you men, women and the Undecideds out there. Brandeys is open every day of your life during the week they're open nine and nine Sunday's 10-05 and you'll find them at 12-90 North Edible Highway in Paparovic. It's always worth the trip no matter where you are stuck about a whole bunch of pair of shoes. Maybe I'll go to Brandeys and give me some boots and pumps. Huh? I'll probably go in and say hi I'm the orang who says I'll say yeah pump this idiot. All this week at Brandeys shoes it's a great time to buy men's rock ports. Take 20% off and get a free pair of rock ports sucks with your purchase all this week at Brandeys in Pompeo Beach. My junior honey. Never watched his hair or seem to have a chemical bang. His name was Kirk. Now he's pushing up dirt. Kobe. Wiping through from his chin. Doing heroin. Kobe. Yeah. Never thought it was hot. And now his curt they ain't got Kobe. He got high sick goodbye and he died. Kobe. Made a million at hour never took a shower. Kobe. He's a number one hit in Heaven's Big Mosh Pit. Kobe. He'll be Elvis the King and say Grunge was my thing. Kobe. Yeah. So if you're filled with doubt don't take curts way out. Kobe. He got high sick goodbye and he died. Kobe. Here's a fashion good from Iowa who's usually run on top of things but claim you're like drop the ball this morning sweetheart. Says how about Janice Joplin? Janice Joplin was the second name I mentioned on the original list we started with after Elvis. You can't get much harder than that to be like right under the King. I don't think Janice would want to be under the King but never less. How did his present condition for hers? Let's just like laugh them on top of each other. I don't know they had a lot of importance in Dwight Lauderdale's will. What? Boo's and pills they met have gotten along nicely. Yeah. Good point. How could you forget old Bob Marley? Oh Bob Marley. That's a good point. Put him on there. Should we put him on there? No. How the beast? And I see Carlissel. Okay Bob Marley. Jesus. Well this is good. We'll have a list of about 500 people. And then just to show you how these schmucks out there you know you just look into Find Paul. Knit pickers. Jump in Jeff from Jersey who's generally a little bit more perspicacious than this. I think there must be something in the ear. People who's all those bombs that were testing last night that were disturbing the atmosphere. You were having trouble with a silky casting signals at all the per mutuals last night. And the rumor around the place was at Pompanow that the government was conducting tests. Bombs. Lauderdale. That was just a rumor that somebody there started other one. I mentioned no names. Dick. Anyway, well there's a lot of Dixard Pompanow Park. My squad Brian Sears again, baby. And he is just kicking ass. Given their clinic out there, you guys ought to be taking notes. Oh man. Unbelievable. Brian Sears. His God. We're building a statue a monument to Brian Sears right in front of the track. Jump in Jeff from Jersey says, okay, you mentioned Jerry Garcia, but he's not on the list. Guess what? Jump in Jerry from Jersey or full of crap. How do you like that? You're full of it. 143 votes. And Jerry Garcia's got one. We just added a Monaro. Okay, jump in Jeff from Jersey. We added a Mon because the public out there demanded it. The great full dead heads. See, that's another thing I can't understand. And we've been through this before and they're very militant. They get very hostile and all. And music was great and we wore our tie-died tie. Tie-dome. Hey, how about those leaves? They're coming back to Earth just like the Panthers. Although not quite as dramatically. Yep. Some bad hockey crap going on. I'll try to that. Let's see. Oh, you're looking at about the, they're all the rabbi sent this. It makes me feel bad. I put it on there. The rabbi's not the one to hate you. Is that a different one? No. Or obvious the one to hate. That professional you'd. Hey, obviously. Cox, a hoist, baby. I guess what my new hobby is. Instead of listening to music in a car when I'm driving in. Okay. I am monitoring the morning show. Every day. No, I'm not listening to it. I am monitoring the Mosho. That's my new hobby as opposed to like listening to music. I just want to put him. I noticed that I'm monitoring him this morning. I started and I will continue every moment that I'm in the car between 6.9. I will be monitoring that show very, very carefully. Okay. I'm listening with like open ears and other body parts. How do you like that, huh? It's time to get it on. So Michael Mayow writes this morning again. You're welcome for all the material that you wrote. It's still right from this show and my lips. Playing hooky to remember a forgotten voice. Look at how hot it looks today, huh? Man, you got a new schedule or something? Very memo. Or CD. What's that? I do. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Thank you so much. You're the best. You really are. I know they don't say that around the building, but I say it. He's the one guy we can always depend on for a smile. A chuckle even on adverse times. Like when we're listening to modern remote. Look at what we got here from my close personal friend, a mufflinzy. Has he slides in the machine? Sticks his finger over there on the play button and it goes like like. Oh, right. Oh, wow. He won't get as many voices as he shows, but I'm going to tell you if you approach he was the face-takes and bomb. Little sounds, oh, check out those things. It's a matter. Make a part of the sound. And if you pull down there, you better go to the way or man, be more lean, more brown, or more down to the road. What do you like better? Bobby Brown or Lee Boy Brown? Oh, that's like that. Oh, fuck Brown. This is dumb. This is dumb. Yeah. They're all playing the whole thing. Maybe a little later. Maybe when we play a medley of all the dead people's greatest hits. When you come right down to it, I don't want to say that the dead recording artists are better than the ones who are still alive, but when you really think of it, you look at this list. Huh? When you look at this list, for example, who do we have to rival Roy Orbison, George Harrison, and John Lennon, and Jim Croshingy and Jim Morrison, and Jim E. Hendrix, and Freddie Mercury, huh? And all the other queens. See what I'm saying? Oh, I know. Who do we got to rival them? They mean one today. Puff Daddy, Paul Simon. Paul Simon. He's still alive. That's here for Paul Simon. Good Jewish boy. And Paul McCartney. Who's still looking for a Julio down by the school yard? He's right over here next door. No, he is the school yard. Our Julio. He's bringing up to be the whole school yard. Paul McCartney. I don't know. You put him in the same category with John Lennon and George Harrison, just because he was a beetle. That's like saying that Ringo starts to literally wrote a lot of the pop-up. We're not talking about recording artists. We're not saying that the song is the best music in which would include writing. By the way, Guy Gross wrote a song that he made many more records than John Lennon after the Beatles. So, a low end with wings. Oh, and so many of them are so old. Bubble going. Oh, that's not it. Yeah, but live and let die. Don't bring up, say, say, say, well, I'm really... Oh, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, wasn't that Michael Jackson inspired me to do that? Say, say, say, say, yes. You're all. And if you're like the Big Badly where I brown waiting to hear... Ah. Good. Golly Miss Ma'am. I love Jim Gross. He was one of my all-time favorites. I used to play him on a radio back in the good old days when I was like, you know, a district is a fly. He's the one who's on the radio. WSTV and Sarah Sones. I think that it's still bad, and here's Jim Grossy, an operator. I've a radio. I'll could you help me please this. Here's Garrett and the Ken Carpenter. Just Ken Carpenter. I don't say, Dick again. I think I'm ready to go. Say, Dick, come on. Oh, don't do your love. Oh, don't do your love. And Ray. Who don't was Ray, but I got such a new way. Probably Ray Wayne's here. Ray, man, sir. Sure. That's an intellectual asshole. But the baby. That's a way. If I saw a piece on, uh, maybe it was on a biography channel. There were doing a Jim Morrison thing. And they had the thing about, uh, down here when he got, he never exposed himself here, by the way. He never actually whipped it out. He threatened to, and the cops still busted him Jim Morrison. Because they heard that it was so big it would have been like a runaway, allocator or something. But anyway, so Ray, man, Zerick is telling the whole story. What a suit he is. Remember we had that clip from him back in I would be used to play. But it could be any clip. He also has a real, real, real, pontificating, uh, self-aggrandizing. So there's a little Jim Krochi for you. And let's see who else can we have, uh, who the fuck got in there, huh? How about some queen? How about some Freddie Mercury? I got some of the computer, I think. I've said he knows some queen. How about Roy Orbusin? That's what we want. Isn't that a shame that we have to, like, put him out to the test and it. Well, why don't we have this? And what's upon a time we did? I got plenty of Robis and up in Toronto and my studios up there. I may have to go up there and play music. If you scour some of those things, there might be some Roy Orbusin in there. Some of those high-mostakes that you have back there buried. You mean like only the lonely? Something like that. We sure don't have you got it. You got it. I love that song. You know, you were with my great accomplishment at IOD. Was I got the people, was it the coast of that guy? I got the people to play you got it. I got Disney to convince them to play it. Put it on the playlist. How about that? Yeah. That's the only time I've ever had any influence on a music on other stations, you know, FM in the building. Anywhere. They actually, I remember that they came in and know they're playing the Roy Orbusin now. Just to pacify me, you know. Then he went back and puked into waste basket again. High school in Disney. No, seriously. I mean Roy Orbusin, another one underrated. Roy the boy. Phenomenal. That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney. Get out of here, loser. By the way, nice job there when I'm at the coast. Whatever the hell it thing is now. What is it? It's neither fish nor foul. We don't even know what to tell. That's the end of course party radio. Well, people all over town are saying they've heard those four records and stuff now. They're switching. They're going to power 96 just to spite your ass. What would you open in there now? George is with us. I don't know if I can have a Roy Orbusin song. Oh, okay. Oh, that'll do it for me. That'll put me in a bunch of your better mood. I just don't know which one. Don't forget Tuesday at Smallville tonight that we find out if it's a two hour episode or not yet. What about you waiting for? Get Carlos on the computer there. Get on Warner, but WB and get that schedule for tonight and query minds out there. We got at least four or five people in the audience who see Smallville. Not just sitting around looking because there's some good looking people on there because it's a great show with great story lines and exciting. And because they like those people naked. In fact, I think tonight tonight that Clark Go whips it out. That's what I'm hearing. Now what is so what are we going to play? Oh, I'm looking. Oh, you're still looking for it? That's what I hear Clark is doing too. He's still looking for it. 31 votes for John Lennon. Oh, thank God Frank Sinatra ain't winning. He's got 23 though. Which really disturbs the crap out of me. Couldn't the sing is right of a paper bag Frank Sinatra. I know but he can never dispute the fact he didn't sing as he talked to song. No, y'all. No, y'all. He talked to song. He never sang. Never sang one on his life. And he used to search for the note. He did. He searched for the note. He was star-la. No, y'all. Searching for it. Like, I'm closer as up here. Jimmy Henry's 19, Jim Morrison 15, Elvis only 14. This is not an Elvis crowd. Which is probably pretty good because if it was an Elvis crowd, it would be like a bunch of old farts. And even old fart like me didn't vote for Elvis. Who did I vote for? Who the hell did I vote for Jim Morrison? Pretty Mercury's got 12. A lot of queen fans out there. Jim Crow, she's got 10. Don't let me forget after the break. I also have a red mic. Meows call me, which I will. I'll get to it. I'll get to it. Mike just relax out there. Okay. So, yes, it's only a one hour episode today. And my clock on the WB. Who? Yes, it was a listener that made that up. Somebody that was hoping he'd get two hours of it. Don't worry, Pat. You'd been worn out by about 40 after the hour anyway, so don't worry. We don't need two hours. Freddie Mercury would 12. Marvin Gaze only got 10. That's a shame. Roy Ermasin with eight. Frank Zeph has got eight. Morris Gibb has got six. Well, thank God for Morris getting six. Just the little recognition there. Even though we don't believe it. Karen Crawford or five. Jerry Garcia's got four. For Jump and Jeff from Jersey there, there you go. That should pass a value. George Harrison three. That pisses me off. Shouldn't George Harrison have more than three votes? Sure. George Harrison was great. Certainly much better than Paul McCartney. It's better what you're saying. See Carlos, you're saying there's no contest there. You're saying that Paul McCartney's better than George Harrison? Paul McCartney created more so much more. You know what? So did a grateful dead. No, no. Great music. You don't even let me fall. Let me fall. More good songs than any of the other people. See there you go again. As Ronald Reagan said, there you go again. He had more hits than the other two put together. So that made him the best recording artist. How many hits do Frank Zeph have? Half a one. So, so that made him a bag recording. He earned it. See what we didn't ask who is the most commercial recording artist of all time. Oh, they got. Yeah. How about Perry Como? Paul Row. No. We got that Perry Como. Here's somewhere in Bride. Thanks to Boca Brian. In fact, it's your purpose. Yeah and now they did it in Coks. Three come on. Oh, come on. 9 57. 16llenнес, 13学ib합니다. .... OK.

Maybe they just saw him in concert that last time they figured must be getting pretty close. Here's another one that says, Whoa! The door's too airy and sexual. She'll hang up the phone. If you choose, the rest piece will get double with a Rubes sexual with me. Tiny timets says, no, no, they even they say no. Bad from a howl on Dale says, I can't get to computer vote right now, but just get in there and vote for Ricky Nelson 50 times she says. But don't you think I would have Rick Nelson's greatest hits in that rack back there? You should. Don't. Okay. I'll sit around here somewhere, but you got such a mess that you made over here. No, you made a mess by cleaning things up. Oh, I'm sorry. No, seriously. I know where everything is and then when I go away for a period of time, like for 10 or a little months, and then I come back and I find that you moved it all. I like my mother. I start talking. He comes into my house and I come back and I came and find a dog, you know. She just rearranged his stuff. Here's a fact that says, oh, this is WL and Dale Ray and beyond chronic. He says a few dead artists. How about Harry Chapins, cats in the cradle and taxi? Did we ever put Harry Chapin on there? We don't want to put him on or do we? Whatever. Let's put him on there. He'll give a, or something to do. He's, he's, because I heard, mostly this morning while I was monitoring. But it's really kind of like a dead Tuesday. Everything's very, very slow. Better get used to it, because now that football's over for certain teams, like most of the state of Florida, except the bucks. It's going to be like that way for months to come. I have a opinion. It could be a slow Tuesday and a slow Wednesday and a slow Thursday. It's getting mighty slow. So Harry Chapins on there too, Eric. How about Sid Vicious? I'll sit vicious and too pack and biggie. And Alia left eye. Well, left eye Lopez and Tony Hathaway. Tony Hathaway is dead. Who? Tony Hathaway. Don't you remember he did a song with the, who do you do that song with? I remember Jane Hathaway. No, no, Tony Hathaway and, uh, was it, Dion Warwick not Dion Warwick? Who do you do a he had a hit with somebody? I could look into book with that would be cheating. Donnie, you, you wouldn't know. Carl was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, he don't even know. Left eye Lopez from Hector Lopez. Roberta Flime. Thank you very much, mom. I'll tell you, he's going, and now he's got the glasses on. You see that? He's got the spectacles on. Now he's really getting into this heavy duty. Really serious. Uh, Roberta Flime and Donnie Hathaway. Where is the law? I think that was the name of the song. Where is the love? You don't remember that? Do you remember where is the love? Oh, yeah. What is wrong with your man? That was Donnie Hathaway? Yeah, he's dead. No, at least what says here. Can you play Jim Crow. She's don't mess with Jim. I could play that if I had to hold CD here. I mean, Robert, download that. Thank you, Robert. You're okay. And spite of what I heard most say about you this morning when I was monitoring. Also, it says I read that art bill retired. Yes, then I got some guy and they're talking about ghost. I'm coming back from the track last night. And any K we're doing is gambling. So I punched over to Iodin. Who is that guy? They play ghost music in the back. George Nori. Oh, and they play the spooky music in the back. Oops. And Marvin Gays beautiful daughter, Nona, Nona, Nona, Nona. Will appear in Matrix 2 reloaded in the role intended for the late Alia. Well, at least there's some justice there. Marvin Gays daughter. Marvin could make it his busy. He's busy with a virginery on the side of that building. So we're building a great list here. What's that sound? I'll retry that other. That's on, there should be on there. Oh, I found something though, by the way. Okay, and he colored clown. They call this man. It's right above. Tip goes to my room every night. You didn't like this song? No. Oh, I like it last. And now it's blue. I mean, you can play a little bit. I'll just keep it. But there it is. It's right above, ladies and gentlemen. Close my eyes. What is the lesser song? I don't know. Oh, yeah. What do you know? Brilliant. Oh, you got it. Oh, you got it. Which was like very late in this. Very well. But he's still the same. I'll tell you. Killer. We know that's so depressing. It's even more, I mean, at least the reason we played all the depressing BG stuff yesterday is because Morris just died over the weekend. So we were able to tolerate some of the earlier BG's, the real prediscody pressing days. But that's really more of it. But right above, you'd have to give us one of these strangers. Not just ugliest. He was ugly. But one of these strangers look and do it's whoever recorded the song. When you agree, absolutely. That'd be a good poll to take some time. These strangers recording artists. Huh? How about love estranged by Mickey and Sylvia? Who? I know. How about strange brew by... Strange brew by a cream. Very good. Very, very good. How about our clapped and he's not dead yet? But we're working on it. His kid is. Close that window. Two later. Remember that day that we lost touch with the audience? Right. You lost touch with the audience. We lost touch with the audience. So here's the list so far. Has the poll come in a lot of votes. John Lund and 41. Moff said he voted for our John Lund. Took the easy way out. Frank Sinatra 29. Jim Morrison 26. Now we're talking. Oh yeah. Greatest voice in history. Next to Luis Miguel. Luis Miguel. If we can call Morris. More. We can call Luis. Lou. How you? Lou. How you? Lou. How you? Lou. Let's see. Just taste again. John Lund 41. So now for 30. Are you all farts? You silly people. John Lund. Jimi Hendrix 26. Jim Morrison 26. Elvis 18. Yeah. That's about where he is in our crowd. This is not a big Elvis crowds. Or maybe again on the 80th anniversary of his death. Or maybe don't play no Elvis stuff. Or maybe he's a little bit more. I mean, the BG stuff yesterday. They tolerated well. They took it. They took it with good in good spirit. I mean, like if Elvis dies again, we could like have an old Elvis. It'll beat us over the head with the BG. Plus our problem. It changed a lot of the Elvis people away by testizing. They men out there who've been. Oh, slup in the Graceland. Remember that one show that was a lot of time ago. But I was in shock. I said, all you guys that have gone to Graceland. Your wives and girlfriends must have dragged you there. You couldn't possibly have gone. Oh, no. You're wrong. The other fact. I think I think next to playing golf. The surest sign of having no life is going to Graceland. To see the king. But what is I don't know.

No. So, Muffie was doing so while, until he mentioned the song, he voted for John Lennon and then he said, and I just got this video. See, they all did corn. I'm not gonna get to the call on them. Are you part of your part? John Lennon, Paul McCartney, all these people did a cornie tuner. But I mean, the ballad of John and Yokel, I mean, she just makes my skin crawl. She's just obnoxious. See how? Uncalanted, right, idiotic, silly, grotesque, right, but other matches pretty good. What do you say? Christ. I can't believe he said that. Jesus Christ. Well, I'll tell you what I said that in God away with it was Phil Sims on a broadcast on Sunday. Phil Sims was talking about the plays, repetitive plays, and they're saying, oh, Christ, you're gonna have us run out again, something like that. On a national on that work on CBS, Phil Sims, he can get away with it because he's a job. What was Muffie? That yeah, it's got a good beat. You can dance to it, I'll give it a four. You can dance to the ballad of John and Yokel. Go like the melody. Oh, I see. I never know what he's serious enough because he took the glasses off again. So I don't know. I mean, all the Beatles songs to say, I mean, here I've got the number one hit. Oh, so they'd like to pick that. We don't want to play Beatles. We play it enough Beatles already. I'm sick of it. I got Beatles crawling out of my ass. I think there's something you can take for that. Oh, let's call the bug man. He's good. Oh, we never mentioned that on the ear, given the bug. Oh, we don't like it. And even though he's a little peculiar, Steve, alternative is that alternative alternative. TATM, alternative, alternative, alternative, alternative, alternative, alternative management. These people are spectacular and Georgian, I both both had him coming to our homes and he's, and they don't spray with that nasty harmful stuff. They put, he puts that little stuff up in the corner of his borax. They use all these alternative, uh, bad man. I haven't had one aunt in that house since the day that he walked out. Since the final ones went up in a corner and met their maker, you know, Marvin Maker from Monticelli, Raceway. There you go, Dick. No, see. Little Marvin Maker, action from Monticelli. He's no Brian Sears, but we can't all be. We aspire to be Brian Sears, but we can't all be Brian Sears. Here's this chronic jump in Jersey, a jackass is, we're going to leave off James, Boulushi, uh, the great voice from the Blues Brothers. He says, oh, I mean, Jim Boulushi. Yeah, we're doing it in both of, just a joke. Just a joke, okay. Relax, it better, Frank Sinatra. I'd rather hear John Boulushi sing a now than Frank Sinatra. Boy, I'm trying, oh, yeah, here, uh, you know, we are, we screwed up bad. But that's okay. It's a four hour show. We can add a lot more before we get out of here. It'll keep her busy every moment that we do another name on air. Keeps air committing another sandwich. He's got those finger sandwiches. You know, like, what your hour enjoyed? Well, you can eat a lot more from real fast to small ones. Bobby Darren. Of course. Mac tonight. Everybody loves Mac tonight. All of he had much better songs than Mac tonight. Like dream lover. That was a great song. I wish that I had that here now. Don't have it. What other Bobby Darren songs did we love? I could reach back there and give my book, but that's not as much fun. That's like, as a call beneath the sea. Dan, somewhere beneath the sea. Don't, I don't like that. Hope he. How can he compare that with dream lover? That was what was raining him off. I didn't say that it was as good. You did. Just like you said, you liked Valorant of Yockel and Schmeckle. We're monitoring mobile. The way that's her new hobby. Friday to book comes out. We're just we're just trading water here until a book comes out on Friday. And then, oh, then all of crap breaks loose. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Any idea? Okay. I'm crazy. I'm Sunday. They like to be playing that. That, um, small bill. Yeah. And if I'm five o'clock, I think. Yeah, usually the repeat, but this week in my work told me it was, um, uh, that two hours special. No. And did you take it? No. No. There was no two hours special. Yeah, there was. They would last week. Last week. What? The tornado. Oh, but that's, but that's still a little episode. Don't, don't panic. That was an old episode. Kiki Wi-Fi. Come to bitch right now. So anyway, this, the word I do with that list.

launched a crusade He created a summer holiday called Hookie Day His listeners met him at Captain Jack's ocean Frontickey bar in Poverty Beach And they drank the morning away We're doing this because August doesn't have any holidays Winner explained in 2000 I figured two three years max will have this declared legal holiday And everybody will get the day off Winnery wasn't an international pop star Like Morris Gibson was death didn't rate front page coverage Even in the region where he worked for 27 years He was just a solid guy who did a lot for the community He raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for local boys and girls clubs Including the organized wineries raiders volunteers who cleaned the public parks And he co-founded shoes for kids which collect sneakers for poor kids Winnery spent 17 years at WIOD The station at launch Larry King's career And was a former home to the arraggers and high goldburg The station rewarded him by firing him in 1993 Said he wasn't attracting enough young listeners Wouldn't even allow him a farewell show Even as Winnery bounced around the south Florida dial Leasing his own time over the past decade He maintained the loyal core of listeners Tactchester was one of them Their friendship was born 25 years ago when Tactchester owned civil restaurants And sent Winnery a case of smart Avacca for a 35th birthday Winnery repaid the favorite few years later By showing up on Tactchester's law that's six a.m. with the cross-brings high school marching band It was my 40th birthday, Tactchester said I knew something was up When I heard the dog making funny noises I opened the door and there's a hundred piece band Tactchester's bank old band and there's Mike with his headphones on Broadcasting he said Danny we put four cases of champagne and nicer You can make a party of it Now Tactchester's tiny party and fundraiser in his old friends memory It'll be February 20th from 5 to 10 p.m. with his new barn for Lauderdale 33 55 northeast 33th Street The 20 dollar check to the boys and girls club gets you all the chicken and ribs you can eat He knew Winnery hadn't been well for the past year Figured it was serious when Winnery gave up the booze Winnery was a less frequent part of the breakfast club Friends who would eat and drink after Winnery show Winnery step by Tactchester's new barn early December There was something wrong with this throat He said something about a tumor a few weeks later he was gone Dead after surgery Everyday it's somebody else said Tactchester We can hardly walk because of neuropathy I just wanted to do something for him Try to raise a few more grand for the boys and growth clubs I think we would have liked that and he had a hard of gold Nice going there Mike Mayo at least you made an attempt People as it was at least you made an attempt And the main point in there was here's a guy who did a lot for the community Ways the lot of money was a fixture for almost 30 years And he gets 300 words in the guy dance on Sentinel And 200 29 in the hero and is buried back on the obits paid so to speak Tom Jika of course being too busy He's out there in Hollywood again for the 500th

Good to think we need a lot more of those shows on here. No, Stardates, Star search star uh Jones. I mean, well, what's it all about, man? What is it going to stop? It's not to run the score. It's reality TV isn't it? No, it's a polycraft. It's a polycontribut which is what they specialize in. Contribut here's two passes from Adrian. Adrian, get off my case already sweetheart. How about Bob Marley. He's on their mind Bob Marley. How's he doing? Maybe maybe Eric didn't put Bob Marley on there yet. Ah, like I said, my apologies to Adrian because a yo Adrian, we screwed up. Get with it, Eric. Okay, it's into great that you're facts me. There's other things that I can't make heads or tails of. Thank you so much. But let's get Bob Marley on there. Because if we leave Bob Marley, it's going to piss off a lot of books. Here's today's Greg Facts, which is just in time because I noticed we only have a couple of calls on a board. It's only 1102. And I'd dog it one in a studio. Hank is doing his game at the heat. It says that the AAA arena. Oh, I sure hope it doesn't sound like the last shows he did at the AAA arena. Remember that? Sound like he was talking through a tin horn. Then we got the big, he's doing a show at the senior ball. That's seven o'clock, which we didn't even know there was a senior. I guess I did. And then a ten to say he came from GA with all our gambling stuff. Joe and Mark overnight to talk about Pompano Park and how they can't talk about it. Do we ever find out what that was about? Joe and Denial as he denying that. And we'd like Joe a lot, Joe Costello, but he's lately. I think since that wedding a little strange, you know? A little bit on the strange side. Here's Greg's Facts for today. Yesterday's Facts were so good. I don't think he can outdo it. He's really moved up in our estimation light years. Hasn't it even you or Sammy? Sure. No, you're not. Well, it doesn't bug me like he bugs you. No, because he doesn't have a fetish for you. I've got to write anyway. It says I don't care what the final results of his pull are. The best thing you ever did to realize is Jim Morrison. See now he's sucking up to me. Just like Mo is trying, hey, we're monitoring you, Mo. I hear all that sucking around. I'll be stopped doing that for a few days. Since I told him to blow it out as old as. It says the doors are a group that were way before their time. If the same group would come out today, they would have dominated even more than they did in the 60s. Also, I'm not sure you agree, but I happen to think the doors the movie is absolutely incredible. Val, come or did they dead on Jim, who could have done better? Except maybe what's his name? Does the news and I would think my former producer that knit what John Levitt? Who used to travel with the doors? And then he used to slam doors in his faces, what I'm hearing? John Levitt. I heard him also when I was listening to that spooky guy that guy would have ghost on I would be last night, what's his name? I don't know. You told me before. Carlos that came from him. But anyway, and I heard the newscast. There was John Levitt. My friends in the Jewish community and my friends in the light and community. Oh, get out of here, John. Man. Anyways, as I've seen that movie hundreds of times, and guard that DVD with my life's his Greg, he seen the movie hundreds of times. Even the godfather and network as many times as I've seen those movies, I certainly could have seen them hundreds of times. I would say that anybody who has seen any movie, except maybe Debbie does Dallas, a hundreds of times has some kind of neurotic problem. I'm sorry, Greg. It says there are the only music from the 60s that I love. See what there's more problems. See what I'm saying? You probably don't remember what I sang a song parody on your show spelled P-I-P-A-R-I-T-Y. See, parody is what we have in the National Football League. All mediocre teams. P-I-D is P-I-R-O-D-Y. See, I learned something already today, Greg. Not parody, but parody. Have you got it? Oh. I sang a song parody on your show about seven or eight years ago, using light my fire title Schula time to retire. Never that? Yeah, no. No. P-I-S, it would make my day if you could do it. Your Ross Pearl impression, please. No. So there's Greg and who, you know, I can tell that anyone be as good as yesterday, because yesterday's was as close to perfection. And it was good timing to run on the hills of Morris Gibb passing away. So today, naturally, you don't want to do too good because then I'd like to live up to that every single day. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's a call from Davy. Hello. Davy. Okay, so that leaves us with one call on the board. What a nasty kettle of fish we got here now, you know? Last call is from Miami, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes? What about Kurt Cobain? He's on there. What about me? Well, wait a minute. Maybe, now let me check. See, I'm just going to put him on. Let's see. Kurt Cobain, there he is. Got eight votes. Hey, votes. Okay. I also have got the BG. I mean, I'm not a big fan of the BG. I mean, it just bothers me the way that guy sings like a white woman with that high pitch voice. Right. I mean, I can't stop all settle. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Yeah. And after that, it stops. And yeah, I mean, I can take her a lever, but for the most part, I don't think it's about her voice. I mean, if you want to listen to somebody just for the voice, very polished. I mean, you might as well listen to Julie Andrews. It's about what you know, the rawness. You know, the rawness? Yeah, the rawness, the edgyness, the lack of production. I mean, sometimes you can have like an open source somewhere in your body and it's really raw, but you don't enjoy the rawness. I mean, like, I'm not sure if it's. Even as far as the goboard goes, I mean, most of the artists on the goboard are probably, you know, crappy, over polished pop stars, like, you know, the boy bands and all that crap. Right. And like, oh, town. Oh, exactly. And I mean, I think George knows the most of the good music out there doesn't even make it to the top. Of the charge at all. Yeah. So, you know, that's like, so, so what you're trying to say that Jan and Chaplin was great because she was like, like, Yeah, like that. Yeah. I mean, I don't even listen to them. I think you have to be really stone to really drunk to really listen to them. No, you're getting warmer. Okay. Now, yeah, you're somewhere on it. I'll admit it, but, I mean, as far as I mean, I think she's a lot better than that, you know, Brittany Bichor, you know, well, now you're talking. Blasting power, you know? Mm-hmm. All right, you can meal. Love you. There you go. He made a couple of good points. I'm not really not sure what they were, but he said Jan is Chaplin was great. And if she came door to door selling as the Abon lady, he'd open it wide in the door too. And then kick her ass out. Well, maybe he never saw her. You see her? Oh, yeah. Man, she made Darine look good. Five, six, seven, oh, five. Well, five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the A to. Just a joke, Darine, just relax back there. Why would I have to have you iron a building? I have no idea where anybody is in a building now. You know what? Just as well. Probably just as well. I know what the sales holes are way back there. That way, everything is done. And for PD Lenny's saying to me this morning, heavy metal who sales guy at Barweight and he made this fruitcake. You know, that's stuff. He's talking about other sales people, PD Lenny. Boy, do you see that routine he went through getting on the scale here? Do you see that routine? No. Took off his jacket. Took out his keys. Took out his wallet. Lay that on the table over there. Wait about 45 pounds of wallet. Then he goes over there. I'm doing great. I'm doing great. I need two pounds, soking wet. He's red rough and sore. I get red rough and sore. Just seeing him waddle in there in the morning. He just, that's one of the things about not being here. That's the best. That is the best. Not having to lay my eyes on PD Lenny. It just makes me feel like a real human being. So he doesn't like the BGs because they're muted. Well, I mentioned that yesterday that it wasn't exactly what you called your Machu group, but it's fun to that. I will say this in our pool, which we got a pretty good bunch of Machu guys out there. At least here for them. They did very well. Did you think they did better than expected? Better than expected. Right. Especially with the sour ass hateful audience. We got a people who were, and didn't that guy say that it was very Negatorid that phony shrinked the call the other day. Right. That's starting up his crap again. It's Negatorid. When we want to feed Negatorid. When we want to feed positive, like about the BGs, it was mostly positive. So there he goes. The NME. That's the way life really is. This isn't one of those like hearts and flowers shows where we try to smooth everything over like Jonathan Edwards. Paula Crap. Here's for Lauderdale. Hey, what's up there Chief? Yes sir. How about DJ, Jam Master, James? Oh yeah. No? No chance. He didn't collaborate with our shmith and we can go there. Is there a career? Did we give we kinkled their career? No. No, he did not reccynled their career. I think so. I think so. I think so. Did you hear that? He reccynled their osmith's career. I think this guy's maybe a little jaded in his view, don't you? Erosmith has been hot again. What was the movie that they did the thing from? And that's, I mean, it's just one. I just mentioned that in passing. The F. Hollow, the astronaut movie. Yeah, what a pilot. Whatever it was. They don't want to be. Armageddon. Something like that. Armageddon. Rekindle, Erosmith's career. Sure, I've heard a lot of her talking about the run DMC thing, but that came from Stevie Tyler himself. Yeah. That they were basically done until that phone call came in. Yeah. Well, I told him that we kindled his career. Stevie Tyler. But was, was that the guy that died? Does he even have the right guy? I, yeah. That's the one that just died here a couple of weeks ago. He died. Exactly. And it was, in fact, it was like a couple of months ago. I'm sorry. Don't you remember people calling him were correcting us on which, uh, I can't keep track of all these rappers, man. I can't keep track of rappers. It's like having 600 various candy bars assorted in your, uh, on a floor. And then you try to like keep track of the rappers. You just can't do it. Although I do like a Clark bar, if you know him, they still make those. So, he ever had a Clark bar? Sure. Oh, I don't know what it is about a Clark bar, but I sure do like a Clark bar. It's like the heat bars better. Yeah. And the escort. Ooh. Everybody likes to score. Man. And what's really the difference? Let's get 50 of men here tomorrow and, uh, I'll eat 20 of each. And you'll eat like, huh? And then they'll carry me out of here. Right. We'll have the, we can take that one. The best day of the touch. Oh, I could just die today on the air. Man. I do like a good Heath bar in a score bar. And they're, they're real thin and there's not much to them. So even though they just pure sugar, it would be like taking an injecting liquid sugar into your veins. They're so pure sugar. But they don't satisfy you because they're so small. Right. Now somebody brought home the other day from Doris Market, a chocolate can only. That was just sitting there on a counter. Like, again, like the cheese and the trap-aates. Didn't need it. Didn't, I looked at it. I looked at it and I said, oh, man. Didn't touch it, though. Good. Well, no, I take that back. I did like Connie didn't and Godfather 3. Remember the like, well, a little light. Oh, you have some years so skinny and, and come in with that little, and you know something. Just that little tiny bit. I could tell that was 400% sugar. Sure. If I were to eat that whole thing, my blood sugar would have been 45,000. Fulminous after 11 at 560 WQA, a lot of dead recording artists out there. A lot of people dying lately.

Who says someone has been stuffing hairpieces inside all the dolphins' Docsdrefs any idea who's been doing this. P.S. Can't wait until baseball season's far to listen to the lovable Crow.

We didn't ask for the best. I purposely did that. We asked who's your favorite. Which doesn't mean that they're necessarily the best. For example, I think that Jim Marvin G21 was better than some of these other ones above him, but not necessarily somebody's favorite. Paul, I'm saying does that make any sense? Maybe a little bit. There's a difference. It's not like food. If you were to say what's your favorite flavor of ice cream, then that would be the one you think is the best. Right? Right. Okay. Anyway, Marvin G22. Frank's app of 20. Roy the boys got 19. If we had more of that, Roy instead of that awful thing that you played. If we had something good, like you got it. Only the lonely.

I'd rather vote for Billy Vaughan. Really Vaughan? Dot records? No. He was he was to dot records with Ray Conifors to Columbia. He did all the music on the dot-work on a path to one step. And he actually had a couple of his sail along Silverie Moon by a member of that shirt. Billy Vaughan. Dad and dad and dad and dad would add saxophone. Yeah, he was like a bummer. He was a big sax man. Oh, here you go. What about? Ha ha ha. Maybe your psychic powers are kicking in because here the fact that says. From Scott and Titusville, who generally has something useful, but today made an exception. What about Stevie Ray Vaughan? The answer is still no Scott. No chance. Or did Ed members of Leonard Skitterd, which we had that before now? It's at only if the back door street boys with crashing a mountain and doesn't Michael Jackson Count is dead because he sure looks like it. A lot of weeks out of day Scott. Little wait, but it is going to be a kind of a week Tuesday. That's what I heard when I was monitoring. Mo this morning. Said it's kind of a week Tuesday. Here's a fast from your favorite Tim Pots, which you don't put his name on there because he thinks that I know. I know your fax is okay, Tim. You're not full and made Tim. Tim Pots. Pretty soon you won't have no pots to a hissing if you know cut the crap. It says you probably don't know the first of it. They weren't tough for a while and the musical be missed by millions. I don't know the first two lanes. Stanley, Allison, change and Steve Clark, they've levered your right. What do you say? No. John Bonham led Zephym, boy. You ought to see the way he spelled John Bonham. And Keith Loone of the who? Oh, speaking of that, that's not good to put who people on there right now. So I could, you know, Pete Townsend said, Uh-huh. What about John, that's what's all of the who? No, which is tight. No. No, see a group like that. It's very hard. And you know, it would be like to put none like Carl or Dennis Wilson from the Beach Boys. Right. Can't do it. And besides the who, you know, besides the lead singer and Pete who is, you know, the guitarist and writer. Did you mention Pete Townsend and you won't stop it? The BG is a sold more records than any of the group of the Beatles. Not only did they write number one soundtrack of all time, so they're in a fever. They also wrote that number one single from a soundtrack Greece. And you know, I don't know why I wouldn't play that. You know, no, who sings that or will be Newton John and they don't sing that. Yeah, they do. It doesn't even sing that. I think Frankie Valley sings that on the record and in the movie. No, they don't sing that song. They sing some or love it and all. Oh, summer level was songs. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, boy, if you think I don't like his acting, you're the, here what I think about his singing. He has a record. You man, can he sing or what? No. That John revolt a. Here's another facts with little tiny handwriting on it from Arnold. It said, what is with that douche bag? George, the spick. He acts all cool. The nice on the air, but he's rude. I'm not just when somebody calls on the phone. Right. It won't let you get someone in without hanging up. It says, if you George, you suck. If you back on the mic all, you miserable. This is great. Oh, he's one of many people who wants to have a conversation with me off the earth. No, we don't. If I see George having a conversation with anybody on the air, I immediately throw rocks through the window. Explain that on the air a lot. This is a talk show. And the only people supposed to call in are either Rimmer or people who have something to say to me. He's the guy that calls up and says, I don't really want to go on the air, but. And that's not. No, no, no, no, no, no. Arnold, Arnold, sorry. We don't play that game. If you want to call George, I give you his home number and his cell phone. And the number to smoke. So nice to you on the phone. I give the number to both of you. I mean, we're we're we're. Young used to this. This is me last week. You mentioned the Frank Zephasong titties and beer. It's off the live in New York. I've noticed for Frank Zepa. But, but still, I wasn't that album. I had nothing to do with the song that I keep thinking which I'll play in a minute. It's live at the rocks here. Something I, you know, I'm sure that song is like a take off. I don't know. Maybe I could be wrong. But nobody, it's a parody on something. P.S. George, I dedicate the song who are you by the who to you because you're so phony with your split personality. Take care Arnold. I don't get splurged. I guess he's taking care of me because it says no on the top. It doesn't mean you take care. He's thinking in your case, take a good. Which he already did this morning is what the report was. And it was great. I do the job I'm supposed to do in whatever room I'm in. Arnold. Yeah. Arnold. Here's John Antwistel from the who just died. So what? Excellent. Thanks. Thank you from somebody who's asked about 600 different names today, but it's having a real good time. That's what we hear for just like our good friends, sunny from the market used to say, we're here not for a long time, but for a good time. And that's what we're having today. A wonderful time. Have any of correct that anymore this music yet, including a John and your Colo onel? Amel? I'm final? 5. 5. 6. 7. 5. 6. I can't believe that. That song, can you? No. I mean, here's number one, Beatles hits. And to pick that song is like 27 hits on here. And there's some bubblegum. Some of the early crap that I really wouldn't wish this on Hitler. Love me, do. For me, do you? She loves you. You know how they all end? Like in do and you and me and you and a dog named Boo and do. And do. And do. I'm gonna hold your hand. Bubblegum. But then can't find me love hard days night. I feel fine eight days a week. Take it to ride. HEP. You have today. Day trip or we can work it out. Paperback writer. Yellow submarine. Elina Rigby. Penny Lane. All you need is love. Hello good bye. Lady Madonna. Lady vagina. Hey Jude. Get back. The ballad of John and your Colo. Something come together. Let it be in the long and winding road. Then there was always why don't we do it in a road. On the way out. Was that on the right? Yes. I played that on here and call him as a rockie. I love rockie. I could have Martha my deal. Oh great. Not a lot of people like Martha my deal. Why not? I don't know. What's wrong with Martha my deal. Well you know something tough crap. I think if you don't like Martha my deal, you're probably a communist infiltrator. We're going to deport you immediately. In fact, a nice sense is what they're going to do is put a little question on the bottom. They're going to a little trap. How much do you like Martha my deal by the Beatles? And if it isn't like at least a nine on a scale of ten, they're going to come and take your ass and put you on a rubber rat and get your ass out of here. And I say more power to him. Because that's the kind of government we're dealing with now. You bet. Hey, another year's coming gone. It's the new year. And if you want to new you and a new house, new looking house.

There's a butt-ass melon and now another edition of Waj. Today, what if Jan is jublin were an avon lady? Well, man, it's... Yes, man, help you. Be careful, baby. Be careful, baby. Be careful, baby. Buh-bye, baby. Be careful, baby. Be careful, baby. Be careful, baby. Be careful, baby. Be careful, baby. What if Nancy Reagan lost weight? Let's vote in just a moment. It appears that the first lady has disappeared. We're next we ask. Watch him. Perfect cross-brain isn't happy with your decision on Mama Cance. He says, what about the sandwich eating Mama Cance and also Stevie Ray Vaughan? They won't let Stevie Ray Vaughan alone. I did not know that aerosomate square was revitalized by Rundee MC. I thought it was Stevie Ray Vaughan. The Stevie Ray Vaughan revitalized Mama Cance's career by Jan Kianette Sandwich out of her throat. He reached right in there and he anchored out. And the sandwich too. So there you go. Okay, oh, yeah. What am I going to tell you? 560, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050 on the 18th. We got an alert by the way for Fony votes. It's alert on Jimmy Hendrix. After we had that little thing and I looked it up in the book, we had a Jimmy Hendrix flurry there. An experience. Yeah, Jimmy Hendrix experience. And I think Jimmy Hendrix is getting a big big big buzzer when a sky is what he's getting from us. Because John Lennon's got 83 and Jimmy Hendrix. All of a sudden, I don't know where he's got 70. Anybody buying that? No way. That's all the people out there. Still do an magic mushrooms that they had shipped in from Amsterdam. Jackie Wilson's on a poll. I don't have any yet. He'll get some. 512 votes already and most of them seem to be real. Couple them. Otis Reading a pair. Patsy Klein for Janice Joplin. Rick Nelson and Buddy Holly 5. See that that's just. Do you realize how ridiculous that is? That Janice Joplin is tied with Rick Nelson and Buddy Holly. I mean, it's just outrageous. Buddy Holly who wasn't around that long because he died in that plain crash. But he was considered to be one of the early pioneers indeed. Kind of like baby Crocodone Daniel Boone. Thank you came from the same town. But I'm sure you must have had many in argument. And I'd like to point out by the way, Elvis Presley is not from Tennessee. He's from Tuple, Mississippi. I just mentioned that for the idiots there on a VH1. Oh, anyway, I had arguments about what? Janice Joplin taught people argue that point with you all the time. At point. You mean, one of the guys said, and then they said, oh, no, she was great. No, no, no. All the time. Really? Oh, she was great. Great. What? A great singer, a great performer. Oh, the same people say that who said that Bruce Springsteen is a singer. Not just a great defect that they say he's a singer at all. I find very amusing. Couldn't sing his right of a paper sack. And to watch him exploit the tragedy of 911, the way he's done. And Wavini American flag and go through this whole dog and pony show to try to revive a flagging career. If I can use that word, just really pisses me off. Bruce Freak and Springsteen. I think he's been blinded by his blight, if he asked me. He couldn't look man for man's ass. Irish Springsteen. Asses. I was just thinking of old Irish Springsteen. Oh, Irish Springsteen is that on here? I think it's ACN. Oh, it's in the thing. It's in your thing. Anyway, the fact that Rick Nelson and the Buddy Holly have to be settled with Janice Joplin who's going door to door to try to sell personal care products to Carlos to an illusion to shower in the abatab. Seriously, you should have seen when I went in to take a leak a 25-year-old. I'll never forget it. And he's got like all these stuff around him. Like he's at home. Some people bathe before they leave in the morning. Yeah, that's really a good idea. Mom, he doesn't have a tub at the house. What? Is he living water? We know if he lives like in a place. And it's car, I think. Does he live in his car? Does he have a car? He has a car. Oh, what kind of car does he have? Little one. He has a little over at Nelson. Just moved ahead of Janice Joplin. Thank you. I've had a surprise to send you. I do. We have nothing. Harry, shape and eight. George Harrison's only nine. George Harrison's got only nine. What's wrong with you, people? He died that long ago. Even if we only wanted to vote on like my sweet Lord. And what's the other one they would I love? George Harrison's song. The George Martin thing. Got my mindset on you. Okay, very good. Oh, very good. And there are a lot of people. That's commercial crap that said like that George Martin. And he allows all of it same crap. How was it? It was great. I played that on Zeta was coming out of my ears. It's Zeta. Because I loved it. Better than that crap. P.D. Bulger wanted us to play. You idiot. You was sassin. You grave robber. Kirk Cobain. 10 Morris give 11 Bob Marley's got 11 months. See Bob Marley's on. What do you what you people be talking about? Karen Carpet has got 13. A lucky number for us. And unlucky one for her though. Jerry Garcia's got 16. Roy Orbison 19. Frank's that between two. I guarantee you, Robby, do a bit if we have some good stuff. Like you got it. You got it. Frank's that twenty two Marvin G. twenty four. Jim Crochi twenty nine. Thank you again to Muff and a little robber for the Jim Crochi stuff. And we never got that many votes. And you want to know what really put them over? Got them that many votes? What? Big Badly were a brown. Oh yeah. Well this is the kind of place when that would be. Almost ever America is the kind of a play. Oh yeah. It's great. But it's a little on the red deck. He said. Oh, I've said isn't the derauguin. No slam round. He could actually burn the city. Have you got your part? He already told me that I didn't credit. That was a talk of the work of the week. He was one of those contrived 40 talk ups. Ricky Tickie. Oh, that's a cute thing. We got a 40 degree in the magic city that day. What is that under that thing? I was experiencing no no they the talk up thing. I think it's under Ricky Tickie. No it's because that's not Ricky Tickie. You're I you're losing it just before I really thought you were like make it a comeback. That's not under Ricky Tickie. The cart that it was on had just a question mark on the front of the camera. Remember the label? Right a question mark on it. Is that amazing that we can remember with our brilliant minds all of this unimportant crap? It's almost like remembering Harold Snoggrass at Hazel Park and your light hill and Jack McCerman and Jimmy Arthur. But anyway, here comes that land at George on the outside and here on a far outside is Candid Rodney just mowing them down. Remember Candid Rodney of course not. So, so, so, Candid Rodney that did that talk up if it wasn't Ricky Tickie. It wasn't him. It was it was a phony it was a was contrived for our benefit. It was somebody at the the coast. Inside the IOD building. Don't you remember that? Of course. That wasn't Ricky Tickie. That wasn't a real thing. And then the burden I were like laughing. Oh, wasn't it on the phone? It had to be on the phone. Is that's when we cracked up when he hit the post? Even the panthers haven't hit the post is off. Of course, when you only got 12 shots, how many times are going to hit the post anyway? But hitting the post, don't count as a shot. I know that. Don't call it. It's stuck in me information. Okay. I know my hockey crap. And believe me, crap is the word they've been playing. A call from Kansas City. Hello. And you know how you doing? Pretty good. How about Robert Harrison at Kansas City? You bad. Are you two living South Florida? Listen to me now. Get you on the net. Right. Hey, a little bit of my thunder earlier. I was going to nominate Carl Wilson. But never when you left out, really major artists of Sam Cook. Not just to put them under. Oh, you did Adam on. And shame on us. No, that's because somebody facts them in. Or maybe not. There's so many of them. You can't. Can't have your thumb on everyone. Yeah, I'll leave you with one more. I think we could nominate key for it. I think he's dead. He just doesn't know it. Okay. Have a good one. Thanks. And don't. I'm not sure why he's not recording artists. All we did have an album. A couple of them. 560, 560, pound 560, out of 18, 10, rise and marvelous line. Jackie Wilson, we just added on there. The list keeps it keeps getting bigger and bigger. That's the way we like it. It keeps expanding like a wild out of control of thing. Where's that thing? Where, um, where the hell is that? Or Jennifer says, it just keeps getting bigger. Yeah. What's going on with Jennifer by the way? Do we know how it heard from her? It was. I want to thought she would have called after my we heard from Terry Griffin after I might die. And we heard from Ricky Tickey, which you're knocking now. No, that thing isn't there. I just don't know what it's under. We're just kind of hard. No, no, no. You don't know what it's under. I thought it was Ricky Tickey. All of these years you thought that was Ricky Tickey was a real real Ricky Tickey. But that's what I thought they were making fun of. And that's what I thought it was labeled as. No. It had a question mark on a member question mark on a mysterious. Oh, I have a feeling he's probably still alive. I'll tell you again. He was from Sagittal, Michigan. Remember we had to look that up because there were others who were questioning my. Knowledge. My question mark knowledge. I know my question marks. Okay. Twenty-till noon at five. Sixty. I'm a QAM. We got the mad dog at one. We got the hopper from the AAA arena where the heater losing every game that they play. What I was on the road now that they're home. They can lose again. I think. Probably. Anyway, Hank will be there to try to drum up some interest because there ain't nothing else going on. Seven to ten you got the big O'erlander also grew at the senior bull. Ten o'clock is any K from GA with all the odds and whether we are y'all sure up again tomorrow. And join Mark overnight. Twenty-till noon at five. Sixty. WQM.

I mean How it seriously stop stopping think about the nature of this poll Here's the question again and a lot of times I'll ask a poll and I You know we appreciate we get a lot of votes in some of the raven real ones, but it's just that you don't look at the question Carefully enough stop and think about it take two or three seconds before you hop right in there and do something stupid like Duff talking about the ballad of John Nioco, which you apologize for he said he never wants to hear it again as long as he lives Who who is your all-time favorite dead recording artist dead? Now I get it who would say that Dusty springfield. There would be like saying If she dies someday, which you might saline the on you know You find some frogs some frog in a we don't a frogs aren't allowed to vote in our pool Okay, they can croak if they want to but they sure can't vote on our pool Who is your all-time favorite dead recording artist Elvis Janice Joplin John Lennon how about the layman sisters How about Lawrence a well huh Lawrence a well what what's that thing we got in there?

Okay. Mo Gibb Marvin Gay Jim Crouchy Jim Crouchy Santa and O'Bee Go Bein are there on the toe car Down the road You're gambling I think if they want to have a true test of a patriotism that everybody should stand up and anybody who raises their hand and says they don't like Jim Crouchy Immediately deported that would satisfy Papu Cannon. I think he's a little bit unhappy. The love you folks came in George and Carlos Jim Crouchy buddy Holly You like buddy Holly sure why not we like buddy hey, he was a little overrated. I would say though How many hits did buddy Holly have before he died Peggy Sue That'll be the day that was buddy high in the crickets. What else? Let me look it up in the book just because we don't want to be scientific What else I mean he did die in a very young age and he was gonna be bigger than no life itself I guess he was extraordinarily ugly like where Orbison I think that helps I think that helps a lot. Oh look at all the hits on here But not dig one thing Peggy Sue that all all boy that's right. Oh boy Maybe baby Rave on oh yeah Think it over. Pools paradise early in the morning real wild child Heartbeat it doesn't matter anymore raining in my heart and someday when I'm gone from you Oh Bobby V in the cricket that must be after rather playing crash Bobby V.

We have a contest going on between the cart and a cart machine rubber ball rubber we see I had my balls confused Yeah, I had my balls all screwed up there rubber ball by Bobby V and red rubber ball was by the circle jerk. That's wrong with you Five six seven on time to the music stuff that we do I just to get blown away In fact, I think we're changing format to all music starting right now. Okay? I mean if it was good enough for Q and back in the old days not your and TR signals probably a lot better now than it was then because our crack engineering to burn Aren't they on crack I said you who do it was got a big crack. I'm sure that because he's he's a good guy They like really a lot.

Talk about heavy duty Good going Miss Molly how about little Richard he's still alive. He's still preaching it Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty pain no attention to those Jimmy Henry's folks I know he's gonna get de-cute. He's gonna get back for a laptop break into wire and get knocked out a couple of notches and by the way Anybody speaking at last on break into wire who tells me that Randy Wapels any great driver that the driver's in the Ontario whatever they call it the Ontario the O.J. C. Circuit Aren't great. I know is just having fun with me like Dick Finder was doing last night Dick Finder by the way We'll share with you some of the acid that they dropped in his coffee last night at the track he was talking all kinds of stuff When he started telling me about what a great driver Dave Ingram was at that point. I didn't know what it'll happen Cry 567560 pound five 60 on a 18 and T in Verizon wireless line Here's a call online one that don't have nothing next to a George hello Where's this from? I don't know here's a call from somewhere Is that me that's you? Where are you calling from sir? Okay, four a lot of days all right. Why wouldn't tell anybody either? Okay, well, I know some of the details about that The error Smith Resurrection and run DMC Go right ahead the actual they put him back on a map is what I'm hearing We'll sort of the actual resurrection happened long before the army get in soundtrack in 1989 with songs like rag doll and Jayne has got a gun right great right Right before that though before we saw the band again on MTV Run DMC read the dot song and had arrows Smith star in it So they didn't really have anything to do with it. They just kind of showed us even Tyler right before David Getson Resurrection arrows Smith with the genius got a gun and everything there you go Can I ramble a quick conspiracy before I hang up the only two sentence sure go right in okay The term British invasion actually originated from the CIA to represent British artists whose lyric some of their lyrics We're originally intended to work on the minds of a few assassins living in the United States But that all ended when the CIA used their own assassin marked David Chapman the killed John Lennon who didn't know the origin of some of the details There was deep enough to stay living here Right, okay Did you know that the CIA killed John Lennon often told us well, but I never knew that Roger winner Command Either longer right No Yeah So get fed up by the minute folks. Anybody that picked on skinny covers, then I have to call over my big fat smelly body. I'll tell you that right now. Okay, Steve Connor is gone. Right next to you. That's right. Great. I still don't understand anybody doesn't like their music. What is there to knock about their music? Huh? I mean, I realize not everybody likes fish food or rocky road ice cream, but how could you not like aerosmith? Explain that to me. In addition, which I discovered, and I found this out the hard way over the years, is every time we talk about music, that the people who dislike them, dislike them intensely. It's not like just a hate them. I don't know. Maybe they figured like they're competing with somebody that they like. I don't have any idea. Just that the people who don't like aerosmith, hate them. Both of them. Now here I was trying to think, thank goodness for it. Duff here, because this is one of your expertise, is this corny old music. Him and Boca Bryant. But somebody fakes blue on blue by Bobby Vitton. Which is an exactly Bobby V. He's got Bobby Vitton, the Polish prince, confused with Bobby V. What do you laugh about? That's what he's known as the Polish prince. I know all about that. Sure. It's almost enough to inspire me to play the godfather, Boca. Go to think. In under a body of vittons, who's still alive by the way. Anywhere Bobby Vitton. Are you sure? I'm fine. I'm fine. It's 4 minutes till noon, by I love that. That just gives me an array of mood.

Okay, let's put her on there and see what happens. Put big fat Mama Kass on there. You're going to hear it. Or you're going to hear it. Listen to these guys. Okay. You're just going to out of prejudice. That's right. Carlos just reminded me of the Papa John just wrote. Yeah. The Papa John from the pizza place. I know he died. I know he died. We loved John Sebastian. Let's put him on there. All right. Well, he belongs on there more than Mama Kass. Kass. He wasn't some fat-world slob that ate too many slimy sandwiches and choked on. John Sebastian was pretty good. Musician. Sure. Let's put John Sebastian on there. What do you say? And then maybe we'll put Joel Sebastian on there later. Man, was he a good dish, Jockey? Joel Sebastian. I loved him. Let's put some more that DJ stuff. Okay. No, I mean, it's just a joke. For your just, your brutal. Really? I know all the things that that one facts you said about you. He didn't even come close. So we're putting Mama Kass on there and who else? And Joel, Joel, I mean, John Sebastian. You didn't even know who Joel Sebastian was. He was on the West, why Z and Detroit. He was a, he was at this jockey. Was on Ckl W and Detroit. He was on, I think, on WCFL. And it was also on WSYZ.

Since I've been here at the Bachelor-Rit Recovery Center, I've realized. Ah, I'm not alone. Hi, I'm Chris Death from Idaho. I fell in love with the bachelor within minutes. I've been in several relationships, but they've never seen to work out. The last five guys I dated threw themselves off bridges. Four of them lived, which is good. I'm still not totally over my obsession with the stranger in the house. That's what I call him. But through my time here at the BRC, I realized I'm not the only crazy insecure, knife-wielding sociopathic woman alive. Thanks, girl. Hey, I used to want, I'm Ralph. Hey, maybe some of you girls recognized me. You know, I was a caterer, I'm a senator, bachelor, and as soon as I saw him, I had to have him. But unlike use ladies, I never even added chance to get a rose. He never knew I was alive. I mean, except for that one day, when he came up to my roadscoast, I met. And he said, he's got his skittles. I clamped up like one of them. Clams. I still think about him. But what? Especially when somebody asked me, hey, he's got any skittles.

John Sebastian is still alive. What thought he was? Because you said it. You're the one that said it. Carl, oh, said it. You said John Sebastian was dead. We were talking about Papa John and you said John's. Wait, wait a minute. Papa John said the pizza guy. I was talking about. John Phillips. No, but he was a green with me. He agrees with everything you say. I knew we were talking about Papa John, but I thought since you said John Sebastian that he was dead also. Now we were talking about mama cast. Mama's in a papa's, okay? I don't mind. I don't mind. Mama's in a show. Yeah. David's lady. I have another sandwich. John, so we apologize profusely. John Sebastian of course is still alive.

No. I'll be dead. Hold on a second. I saw it. I'll thank you. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. That's a hot thing. He's dead. Why would somebody from Danny in the middle of the night? I guess because that the hop was their only hit. I mean, they might have had something else marginal. I guess I could look it up just because you're a pain in the ass. Give me that look. That look like you're about Danny. You. Why not? What do you got against them now? Are they redo anything to you? No, look at this. They had a whole bunch of stuff. They're in fact if month went out to his four hour lunch right now. I think he's doing liquid lunch today at the hop number one for seven weeks. How do you like that? Number one for seven weeks and you're making fun of Danny and a freaking juniors Mister. Vocal group form while the high school filled up in 1955 is the Juveniers. There's music with a little bit juvenile and they were the Juveniers. Danny Rap was the lead singer David White first tenor Frank Maffa, second tenor and Joey Terrenova Berton. Remember that the next time when somebody calls him when you say that you're a Danny and the juniors expert when I asked you who the drummer was? The drummer was somebody. White later joined the spokesman or he must know a Brian Murray. The spokesman appeared in the 1958 movie Let's Rock, Rap committed suicide on four five eighty three at the age of forty one. Boys been to the head rock and roll is here to stay remember that rock and roll is here and all the songs had that same kind like pretty crappy sound. Danny I like Danny was pretty good. I knew you remember that to you. No I do. Danny was okay with reach number thirty nine. Twist and you were saying pony expressed back to the hop they kept hopped on it. Like like Chubby Chekor in the twist which you really missed what forty eight times and every time was a hit. Let's twist again like we did last summer let's twist again like we did last winter let's twist again like we did last spring. Let's twist it and you I couldn't pull it. Then you do some peppermint twist. That was the only thing the star one I started. Twisting all my long by Danny and the juniors. I'm telling you my psychic powers are spectacular they're unbelievable. Do the kind doing the kind of walking Ula L'Alimbo. Oh that reached number ninety nine. And I think that was the that was the end for them. But was that before oh yeah that was long no one recommended suicide. That their last hit was in sixty three and I say hit very loosely and this kid committed suicide in eighty three. So twenty years after they hit and I hit on the charts he finally said well that's it we're done. Sorry about that Danny and juniors you're okay by me they were kind of like you know they reminded me a little bit of. They were like the four runner of the new kids on a block. Is it what when you laugh about like that's a joke. That's very serious analization of my musical perspication. I don't I don't know there are some like moneh I don't know say.
