Yes, a buffalo bill. The swathes out in the mill when he roars. But a child he had a pet boy. He really liked to child heavy. And so long that they had a chance to freely see their seagull. Oh, my God, his punch. His tanked over then is Kelly Roar. Oh, they just went to the flesh that swathes the earth's rotation when he roars. I mean, he's running his hair away from the chandelwain in the box. Oh, he's round his hair though when he walks. He's a pretty good man. We don't should think that we got punched right away because we should bring that back out. Play that like almost every day with the funny punch. I've played that in a lot about 400 years, at least at least. 20 bucks from Mad Dog. All right. There's the a football expert. The F. Josh Drapware, the Super Bowl ring on his fingerware. He's got a thing on his ring. For a ring on his thing. No, that's freaky Carlos got a ring on his thing. Anyway, how do you like that? And not that I want to be a show off. I'm glad that they did score those extra two touchdowns. And last those two underception and last minute and a half. Because otherwise, I would have given you the exact score on issue on Friday. And we could have Schmidt can the whole format and just a psychic meal. Every day. Put that misclio to shame. I think that's a great idea. Colin for our psychic progressifications. I gave you a Tampa Bay 34. Oakland 21. And I'm sitting there with a big smile on my push. Minutes and I have to go in a game on. I'm thinking, got to my a genius or what? And then they got the nerve. Like I said, they didn't want me to be a show off. Score those added two touchdowns. Meaningless kind of took the edge off it right there in the end. Nice golf boys. Piece of cake. What did I tell you about rich can and MVP my ass? When push came the show when a big game was online. I George really enjoyed the Super Bowl last night. Rivided because he didn't watch it. You didn't even seem so Indian. Same with national anthem. And what is she doing? I mean, even English speaking Canadians hate her like poison. But I frog. What is she doing down here? Yeah. Sucking out of Quince singing the American National. No, she didn't sing the National anthem. I think that by she sang God bless America, which is even worse. Even worse. Because a lot of her fellow frogs are saying God damn America right now. I said a god bless America. And then they had the chicks with the I mean the dixie chicks. Saying the. That's what I was calling. Huh? Don't you think that's more interesting? It is the chicks with dixie. Cups. They sang the National anthem. They were pretty good. They were okay. We all got a chance to meet them by the way in the old building out the swamp. Do you read the lyrics? So you met, let's see Jessica Simpson, right? Who's actually seen Nick Laella, Shazapina's maybe. And you also saw the chicks with dixie chicks. Boy, are you moving up in the world? So you have time for a small potatoes like slain dine. That needed is most of the rest of us. We've sneaked in a surprise pool on you folks over the weekend. And man, if what's her staring to pour in now, now that they found it. Look at that. I bet you would get up to 900 on a second pool. That's amazing. Isn't it? And on a, especially we had the warm over the weekend. A lot of people out there had the warm over the weekend. So I hear that's what Muff just said. He stuck his head over the door and he said, what else a weekend without the old wicked warm. Something like that. And so a lot of people's computers were down, which cut down on number of votes, right? My was down Saturday. AT&T broadband sucks by the way. I just thought I mentioned that. So does Balsal. And while Carlos wants to differ with you, Carlos didn't get a lot of votes. Which he's pleased with that. You buried him. You even beat me out. Let me get back to the first pool. Get a lot of business take care of here today. Nice going to Tampa Bay. Congratulations John Groen and a boy. What did I tell you? I mean, you know, Brad Johnson. He's not a great quarterback. He's never going to be a great quarterback. But that's not the kind of team that needs a great quarterback. Okay. And people looked at me when I gave the score. They said, oh, gee, would a great defensive those two teams? How they're going to score like that? And when the score was three three for a very long time and at first quarter, I'm thinking, I must be a lunatic. 34 to 21 and a wise up 48 to 21, George. What? See, and then, of course, we got the sour grape mice. There's in monitoring mode this morning. I heard somebody's winters. Oh, gee, it's really the next to the jet's winning a Super Bowl. The worst thing they're saying is that another Florida team won a Super Bowl. What kind of logic is that? What kind of winters? What kind of cry babies, you know? Self-hating. Yeah, instead of like, we're reveling in it. They're saying, yeah, that's not nice. And they got a point there when you came right down or a bunch of mug bumps. But those guys aren't from Tampa, and they're those players on that team. And they don't live the mouth. They do live very good luck to them. They're quite frankly, most of them are embarrassed that they play in that place. But nevertheless, that's the name of the team, okay? Too bad that what's his name? John McKay could've been a lot. Did he die a year ago? Who? John McKay was the original coach at Tampa Bay when they went. They lost all 14 games in a first season. And they lost 26 in the road to the beginning of their franchise. I'm guarantee that if the Tampa Bay bucket here is what has started in this town instead of the dolphins, they've been playing in Rolly or somewhere by now. They've been long gone. Just like the lightning. They've been gone. Because this town will not support a loser for get about it. And they're busy saying, yeah, well, they're there saying up there. Back at you. That's what they're saying in Tampa. And they're not rioting up there like a bunch of assholes like they're doing in Oakland. Where'd he go? I do with that story. Do you see that? And Oakland, they're like a burning car's and not going over crap because they lost the game. Of course, if they win the game, at least they're consistent. Because after they won the AFC Championship game, they had crowd setting fires breaking windows and throwing rocks in bottles. And other they lost the Super Bowl. They had crowd setting fires breaking windows and throwing rocks in bottles. And Strauss starting cars on fire. Vanilized a fast food restaurant last night following the game in Oakland. And you know something it makes me very pleased. You know, the only thing I ever did in my life in Oakland was that gigantic dump that I took in the Denys. Well, I actually took it in my pants, but I'm not the way you ended up doing that. I'm not the way into Denys. But I left them on those soiled underwear. Right there. Yeah. There you go. With this stain and disgust and contempt for you animals that opened, I left you some crappy four-fold pantaloonies. Some fruits of the loom for you idiots. Anyway, can we get back to this because I got a lot of business here. Maybe like three or four o'clock before we kid caught up. Somebody facts is me because they're still faxing. And there are people still hockey me with this crap. Oh yeah. Hey, listen, Dick Fibre. Let me tell you right now. David, where handmade what you think. Okay. I think he wants to represent him. And Brian's here's God. Did I mention that a hundred times Brian? We all love you, Brian. You're the best. There's a hearty's on hundred and third street in the highly. Somebody facts is me. And hearty's made our final. Aren't you embarrassed about that that we had a mistake? No. No. Do we believe that there's a hearty's in highly? Whatever. Now is that forty nine street or hundred and third street in highly? Don't start. I live there. What's upon the time? That amazing. I live right next to a mimey lake's house. That's not different streets just to be assholes. Yeah, because nobody in this town can get along. So we're going to call it a hundred and third street. Uh, no, that's the county that calls a hundred and third. But in the city of highly, where everything has to be different as in the country. It's forty nine street. Right. So that's one of the good things, especially in a tourist tower, you got a lot of people are lost to begin with. And then come and look in for a street. Is this forty nine street? No, well, it's really hundred and third street. Oh, well, I'll go off fifty four blocks and see if I can find it. In addition to which you're visiting this town. What are you doing there anyway? Let's throw coral gables and mimey lakes in there. Just for good. Moral jables. Oh, you don't want to be there. I don't. I don't understand how anybody finds anything in the gables. Do you? Only if you live there. You know your way or I think that's the idea. Yeah. I think it's a plump. Right. So I think it's a lot of the day. A lot of the day with your ducks and your pickup trucks. Anything else that rhymes with those things. In fact, even the aphlect duck they won't live in there. A lot of blue noses in this town. Which And where the appurse did you know that where they poorest. Major market in America. Let's hear it. We're always leading in some crappy categories. There's another one. Bob Herbert's got a column on that isn't the New York Times, which is on our website today. On our very very informative website. Thanks to Carlos. And Eric who is working on it. Don't start. Don't start. It's a Monday. It's a day after the Super Bowl. I know. You started. No. You're starting. It was for our. Up there. Which I. A fact. Tim a thing on Friday. And he did. Good job. Again, this new poll up there real quick. We love. And he also mentioned a couple of cost of things about Carlos. No, he didn't do that. Ten past nine at five sixty WQM happy Monday. He's a baby. He'll bring in a coinage man. Mad dog work. Come eating. He is. You heard that. The whole world was the witness. That me twenty bucks right there. And he's not that we're gambling illegally by the way. Because we sure wouldn't want to do that. Like everybody else does. I think George is probably the only person in America to have a bit on the Super Bowl game. And the good news is you don't have to watch it. To have a bet on it. Right. Want a bet.

Over the past few months, I noticed that was losing some hair. So I talked to my doctor and he told me about rogue game. I asked him about propicia, but he told me since I'm on the antidepressant paxil. Propicia might not be a good idea, and paxil caused a sexual dysfunction. So I take my aggra to counteract that. But that causes me to feel nauseated, which is why I used to say an acid, which works well for that, but it doesn't work for long enough periods for my heartburner acid reflex. So my doctor told me about prioriosec, which keeps me awake. So he gave me zanics, which I started taking too much of, and that kind of worried him. So he weed me off that, and put me on trasodone, which is not really a sleeping medication, but it works like one anyway, and it's none addictive. It also causes headaches, which is why I take my eyes. Bias works differently than any other antideflammatory, and lasts up to 24 hours, and that can be a huge pain when it hurts your stomach like it does mine. Not nauseous, just sharp stabbing pains. I'd recode on fix that, but boy does that make me nauseous. So now I reach for new mafelets, mafelets is scientifically designed to stop nausea instantly. New mafelets, faster doctor. 9.16 at 5.60, WQAM. So we got that straight now, hearty's in highly went out of business couple years ago. So guess what? Miss Miss Marty, cancer, whoever you are at there wrong. Always try to find a mistake with us, okay? And give them a score almost right to the point, right to the exact score. And they're still looking for mistakes. Here's John and Portsa Luceus, says also do the same thing. Union 76 gas stations are in many of these circle cake convenience stores in Martin and St. Lucy counties. Do we care about Martin and St. Lucy counties? No. John, we appreciate your list, and we love you very much. We think, especially if you don't know a Greg, but the fact that the matter is we don't care about Martin or St. Lucy counties. Sorry about that, John. Do we have union 76 here? No, we stand right on top of it. Okay, here's the pull from Mo Friday, the first one. I think I did the right thing by shfoot canning it right away, because you people want to carry that thing on forever. I might have less to been a pretty good topic, but let's face it. Younger demographics, the one here is talk about places that no longer exist. Living and breathing young people under the age of 100, and let me ask one other question, George. Who in their right mind, what person under the age of 100 wants to hear a bunch of fat old guys talking about sports? Well, I'm not hungry going to give me. I mean, let's get serious. Anyway, what's your favorite soft Florida business that's no longer around? We asked and we carried this on for a day. We had the pre-lams, and this was the run off on Friday. And then I got home Friday afternoon. I said, okay, well, we got almost 800 votes under that's enough. Schmidt can it? And I facted over a much more provocative and much more interesting pool to Eric especially, and I thought we all seem to be falling on our face around here since Mohide Town. But anyway, what's your favorite soft Florida business that's no longer around? Eastern Airline. By the way, did I tell you Bobby Mandero stating was bogus while I was showing what I'm doing? Did I say that? It was, because once the show ended, those people all went away. Eastern Airlines 87. And I think that's a good, I think this turned out pretty good. Six facts that land is water park 81. Lot of pedophiles used to let go over there, watch those little kids sliding up and down on it. Bobby Mandero Stadium, which was bogus away through that 65 or like all crank. Sunrise musical theater 55? See what I'm saying? These make sense to me. Topless car wash 41. Playboy Club 38. What? Natural Brillo. Playboy Club 38? Don't tell Janet. How do it sportatory? I'm 36. Wolfies 33. New England, oyster house 32. Sambo's 29. Jordan Marsh 28. Povernex 21. Who knows pizza 20. J. Byron's in Burton Jackson and Walmet Co. Theater's each had 19. I have no idea what the trash would J. Byron says. Maybe somebody will tell me but I doubt it. Malibu Grand Prix in the incredible universe of 17. Pitches 16. Am I the only show of the appearances that we did at Peaches and the shows that we did there? It said it went so on. Yeah? They're all gone. They're gone. They're done. Sad. Fennito. I have an unspent gift certificate to Peaches. Oh, geez. I got a 40 dollar gift certificate from Houston's from my two years ago. I think they'll still take it. I love Houston's. Houston's is still on business, by the way. We don't want to do the Houston's. What you did do? See, say me. Well, with that seafood place. Let's say me. Ha ha ha ha. Well, see if people would keep us informed what's going on. I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming Adam. Okay. Let's play mad. Let's play. He's usually too nice to an impasse. I'm already this morning. Somebody said it to me. Yeah. Well, he, if he would let us know what else going on with these things. But of course, nobody communicates with us anything. Everybody here's in the goddamn vacuum in my right. We're in a vacuum. I think this place got struck by the worm. Morrison's had 14 wags and doll house and shaky's each had 13. Hardies 12 and there are no more hardies in South Florida. Okay. Ten rods 11 and of course that debates still goes on. Okay. We'll get right in here again. He was foaming it to mouth about that. Talk about a militant spick. I don't still dare to run South beer. Or was he saying the opposite that the sign doesn't mention Penrods? Whatever you two guys were talking about. This game baby Street Guys, Pitches had he said seven. And heading ways last with six. Now do you remember on the runoff ones? I remember that my way said low. He votes you right. Although maybe heading ways compared to these other ones. But you're right. I'll what they do that. And Eric there's only one him in Hemingways. I don't want to get picky with you. There's only one him. Just to produce to keep it on his toes. Okay. And if you can keep Eric on your toes. That's quite accomplishment. Can't you seem like tiptoeing right across this computer. Not a straight man. Well, too late. Because we got a new poll up there. Which a lot of people. The votes are pouring in. Look at that. 959 votes already on this thing. This was like an afterthought. But to me a lot more exciting than businesses that have been in business for like 500 years for us old parts. And let me say it again. Who wants to hear a bunch of fat old guys on a radio sitting around talking about ball games that they can't play, you know? I'm not really heard about just stuff guys talking about ball games. They can't play either. Talking about the same nonsense, the same crap. Ponderous over and over. Oh gee. You think they've won? That's going to get a message from John Groot and hear that. Yeah. Are we going to hear it? I mean, the next football game is an until August boys and girls. Am I right about that? August. Augusto. This is still January. Probable. Like I said, the next football game that anybody cares about isn't until August. 959 votes on his second pool. Here's the pool. For those who missed it, that we may have like sneak this by and without when you weren't looking. Neal's rating. Neal's ratings are still number one in men. Damn it. But are down along with QAmen the last year. Who's to blame? This is the kind of pool this audience loves to sink their teeth into. And bite as hard as they can. Here are your choices. Well, let's start from the bottom. We got 959 votes. Who's to blame for the precipitous decline in the numbers on his station last year? Carlos, two ugly to help 17. If he was better looking, he might have helped us out a little bit. Maybe some people would have turned in to look at him on the radio. Right? If we're going to talk about something, and say, you call him ugly. Chuck all the time. So that also kind of like adds to your vote. That's my fault. Because you're the one who invented that. In fact, you're also to want to talk about Mo being a silly old-footie study with bad vercos veins and bad wigs and plant pants. Lime green. Lime green pants. I'm sorry. Doesn't he have Canary Yellow? Lime green amount with white bucks. Okay. Canary Yellow is the mode to do sure at cemetery villages these days. Especially in Bokemon. I'll get with it, Mo. Carlos, two ugly to help 17. The parties over QAmen 58 people said that. I'm sure that most of the markets keep channel and the rest of work here. And they're on to it. Everything's just fine. 85. Uh-huh. All we're fine. 85 people said that. Neil, for seven months of boring bedtime stories 133, I would have thought it would have been more than that. Because I take full responsibility for that. Now there was a reasonably started doing that, which we don't want to dwell on. And again, I had something to do with this nine to ten hour thing. A lot to do with that. But nevertheless, I take full responsibility. I'm not worth those people. It says, oh no, I want to point fingers at sack or it was like Robert Greeper. Or it was me. This one's fault. You know, I'm not one of those people. It does that. No. I take full responsibility for a bad mistake in error in judgment. That's one of the reasons that demographics are so much older. Because nobody on the edge of 100 wants you a bunch of boring bedtime stories. And find out that the world is on the verge of getting blown up. They don't care about that. They want to hear about the super bowl about those nifty commercials. Including the Ozias born one. Nobody talked about that. Did you see that one? I loved that. The Pepsi spot. They can talk about these other ones. I mean, the Yao Yodan. I was cute with Yogi. That was cute. But not even the same category with the Ozias born one. The Pepsi spot where he thinks that he's got his kids and all of a sudden they come out of the fake uniforms and they're it's like Donnie and Marie Osmond instead of the Osborns. And they're like doing their thing. I'm a little bit country and then all of a sudden he wakes up at a cold sweat. And he realizes it was a bad nightmare. And he turns over to tell his wife that he had him. And his wife pulls off the his he's in a fake outfit too. And really inside its Florence Henderson. Boy. It's a great spot. And nobody talked about that one. Well, what can I tell you? Anyway, where did I leave off? Everything's just fine. 86. Neil for the, 133. 13.6% blame me and you're right. And I stand up and take responsibility. You can give me 85 lashes if you wanted. I'll take a like a real man. Even I'm not. Huh? No, it was hot. And you guys see this is another problem in his place because everybody's so goddamn scared of me because they're much of pussy instead of coming to me and saying, you know, I don't think this is really cut. This is bad. It's bad for your show. It's bad for the ratings. The younger people are pissed off and fired up. They want to hear you do your usual thing. We can asshole on here and hang up on people. Which we can't hang up anyway. Now because nobody's calling. But that's beside a point. What? Yeah, that would help. Well, yeah, we can't hang up if they don't call. Well, they're waiting to find out what's going on here now. It's a Monday. Don't you understand you should know by now. Oh, God. Anyway, so I get 133 votes as being the Wonder Blame. But you, it was fairly close to us for a while. But you pulled away George killed things in the summer, 166. B me by 33 votes. And I will say this spring book, excellent. Well, winner book before that. Excellent. Some of them came along. George is on. Oh, not too good. And then we, we haven't come back yet. I mean, we did okay in the fall. We're still number one in men. But not what we would be hoping to be, you know, just because we're following dead air for three hours. That's another story. So George gets a 166 kilodron at summer book. That's going George. He may not be good, but at least he's consistent. In fact, we're going to be discussing it. Why you dislike George so much. Second, Greg Reed, who was leading for quite a while there, but he can't compete with you know who Greg Reed screwed up a wedding line up 237. And we know he did that. I've gone Greg. Keep scratching. And the winner hands down your pants. It just seems that nobody can compete with him. No matter which one these balls we take, nobody can compete with our close personal friend down the hall. He's stupid. Moe, the worst lead in ever 281. That's what it says. Their mole, worst lead in ever 281 beating Greg by quite a handy margin. Two 28. So that's why it came out with almost a thousand votes on a secondary kind of afterthought pull. And they liked it. They responded to it heavy duty because that's the kind of stuff they like. They want to bash. They want to rip. They want to tear. rip me an ass. Okay. All fat funny, daddy. Living in the past, resting on his laurels. See, know if you talk about sports more than there could be some content. We already got enough fat old Jews talking sports. Nobody wants to hear a bunch of fat old guys sitting around talking about ball games. In fact, nobody wants to hear any guys sitting around talking about see that's what really boils down to. They don't want to say that it will run fox because that would be bad for their image. Nobody wants to hear a bunch of pompous self-app aggrandizing giggling assholes like a bunch of stuff a more college kids talking about ball games and shooting it on this and shooting it on it and trying to be funny and ho-ho-ho-ing it up like Tony Bruno. Follow him saying like a laughing hyena. But it's a fraternity so it would not pick on those guys. It's like a fraternity. 27 after nine at five. 60 are topic today is why you hate George so much. Oh, here's a facts before we get to our spot. Neil, I'm with you as soon as the temperature drops to a comfortable level in South Florida. The cysts have been turned to heat up at work or home to ridiculous temperatures so you sweat and the top of it off they were sweaters, caps gloves, parkers, etc. Inside with the heat on. I can't stand it. I'm at work in its effing hot. Love Arnold PS George is still an asshole. How do you like that? Arnold loves you. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it.

I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it I can't stand it.

I have all those people under that will wait and speak to his George Boatham. Huh? I must hang up on him. Most shame on you. 5.60. 5.60. 5.60 on the AT&T line. Here's our poll for today. What did you enjoy most about the Super Bowl? I'll see that in that there's a suggestion there. It's something positive. So am I not going to dig in at response? Didn't watch. The game itself. The score I cashed a bet. The commercials. The entertainment. Like half time in that crap. The end. I'm bird out on football. Or what's the Super Bowl? Those are the choices. I'm sure you'll be sure in Tom and I told you. Very important stuff. What did you enjoy most about the Super Bowl? Didn't watch. The game itself. The score I cashed a bet. Alright. The commercials. The entertainment. The end. I'm bird out on football. Or what's the Super Bowl? We're discussing today the reasons that the audience despises George like poison and why he sidetracked us during the summertime. In fact, muff was just in here saying, what do you think about next summer? And I said, it can't come soon enough. Here's some rise, hello. Hello, Neil. Our first call of the new week. Yes, sir. Listen. I was listening when you first started reading the bedtime stories. Yeah. And I was saying, okay, this is some kind of joke. He's going to be like, oh. Why didn't you tell me then? I thought, you know, I called up. And I said, this is crazy. I mean, who are you for Harvey? And then, and then, and he had people call up. Kissing your ass and Neil, I love what you do the time. Yeah. Like like George and man Carlos and everybody on here, because they're afraid to say to me, boy, this really sucks. Neil, go back to the old Neil that we everybody listens for it. Oh, and then when George would be the host of the show, he'd be like, you don't know how much time he takes and preparing the show. And I absolutely love it. It's his great. He's just sucking his. He's driving the show into the ground. It was so bad. Now wait a minute. Was I driving or do you mean George was driving the ground? Both of us. Oh, okay. Anytime George has control, he drives the right into the ground anyway. At least he's consistent. Yeah. Oh, I'm glad you're back. Well, let me ask you, did you go away for a while? Yes, I did. Uh huh. I listened periodically. And I said, oh, here goes another story about a priest. Here goes. I read. I read two papers a day. So the last thing I needed was for you to do my reading for me. Right. And that way that was for me to keep reminding and ramming down your throat and the pressing things are going on in the world. If people want to see that thing go on our great website on theorages.com, we got all the importance to raising, including a lot that you won't find of your everything in newspaper. And people don't want to dwell on the negative and get all the press in the informed. Uh, they can go right there. But the radio shows for entertainment. That's exactly it. I glaze over a lot of the garbage in these newspapers that murders the this. Right. Exactly. So I'm not going to be aware of them. Like, oh, where's Neil? Where's he? I need him to call somebody and ask on hang up on somebody. Okay. How's that? Well, he's not going to be upset because he, you know, he wanted me to hang up on. So I'm not going to call him and ask. Well, I'll tell you what. He's an asshole. Just because that's what he wanted. Name is a good guy. He was a good caller and he I congratulate him for having a ball's to call. He didn't pull any punches. He said the bedtime story sucked and he tuned out and I'll welcome back. See, welcome back to everybody who was not listening to it in those seven months because they screwed around with the time of the show. And that's not a cop out. That's the freaking truth. If they would just not have missed see the real answer, it wasn't even mole. And I've category the real answer and they had it right for a while until I got carried away with the anti-mobile business. Greg screwed up the whole lineup. We had a winning formula going here. Everybody was doing just fine. We had gigantic numbers. Things were smoking. And I don't give a crap on anybody says whether I'm doing a show in Tim Buck II or Toronto or O'Kamous or whatever the hell it is in the making difference. That's not what the issue is. The issue is what's it all a boot? That's the issue. And once it about a bunch of goddamn bedtime stories and some fat-old man-weeding stuff on the air for four hours of a day, that's a bunch of crap and if George and Carlos both would have had the balls to say, hey Mr. This sucks people are getting pissed off about this and the audience is evaporating. Evaporating like I'd end condensed milk whatever that means. I liked it. Condensed milk? Oh no, the bedtime stories. Yeah, yeah, great. How many diaries did you have? 100? Yeah, we wish. We wish. I got diarrhea. Yeah, myself. Just from watching those fall members come up. And by the way, Tom Jico, welcome back to town. He was in Hollywood, Mr. Big Shot. He's still writing about the network TV stories. See, that's the excuse. He won't be writing about this book that just came up, which is a big story for Power 96 and also for this midday show. And a station in the rest of the day had the pro-pumms. And because it's after the fact, you know, it's old news now. That'll be the excuse. Somebody please go out and take a photo. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. Now, we can just have the workshop. 560 560, pon 560 on the AT&T and Ferraris Wireless One. Let's hear from people who went away and came back. Which includes everybody on the Age of 100. Don't be a sucking around. Tell us honestly just how bad it was. Now you hated it like poison. Now everybody in town of your friends were saying what the hell happened in that f head or old fag? Anyway, what's wrong with that show? Huh? Where's the yucks? Right? He's a yuck. Yeah. He looks like a- here's for the owner nail hello okay and that's a question for you uh... i can't just when you know that you're stuck in a baronism it's sick yeah back my task can be sitting right in there how come you're talking about religion makes this guy sick the religion makes me sick because religion makes him sick and you know what's your make me sick five six seven five sixty pound five sixty on the eighteen two horizon world let's get these people off their ass here again today uh... these are all people are up till two in a morning either parting or like a threatening jump off the balcony because of a stupid football game last night i got to be honest with his much as i love temp of a winning and i really relish the fact that they ran it up there at the end forty eight twenty one it wasn't the telecast left a lot to be desired i like how michael's lot i love john madden but john madden you know john there comes a time you know by by john when he started trying to defend that business about the one in the free kick there when it was like they had no time out so that they couldn't stop the clocking in which michael's put it up and he still got well but if they throw it in complete pass here they can uh... i mean if that's got to be about the most ridiculous thing ever heard my life and he was trying to make love those mistakes it was an awful telecast and let me ask you this don't we all by no know what al michael's in john madden look like so i think we all know what they why did they not worse all of them do that why did they insist on having to keep sure what's the only guys because the last thing anybody wants is to see some fat old guy column is a football game not you well but i don't think i don't think people are in the fat old guys are doing sports stuff to you no no way and George isn't in the skinny old guys young guys medium fat in between he's sick of it he's nauseated he's celebrating right now George is having a party not a super party really post super bull party in this house meaning it's all over now for another year no it's insignificant i don't notice it it's like another world like what are the you would have like the azios brun spot on that i'm sure i'll five six seven five sixty pound five sixty on the eighty in fact let's run the audio from it right here on his show today i think that's a great idea i better hold on the thing let's see what i like the best i guess i like i enjoyed the game was okay the score i cashed a bit not a big bet only twenty bucks with a mad dog it's only but i made i'll come on

up there they'll be honest with you it's boring don't you think it's very boring pulls after the fact the superbowl's over with okay it's it's boring here's the results of the poll i just passed there with the new one you're like a lot better here was the one we were taking what what what did you enjoy most about the superbowl the game itself 14 uh the end of bird out on football nine i didn't watch eight eight people we got to watch the superbowl out of 43 what kind of audience do we got out of 52 we got uh nine the game itself 17 the end of bird out of football 11 a commercial's nine i didn't watch eight the score i cashed about four cashed about what's the superbowl two and the entertainment like half time it said or one they probably miss a leanedy on singing god bless america they would like a lot more not and who gives a crap about whether uh shenaya twain was lip-syncing or not who cares i heard mogul and i'm about that when i was monitoring him this morning who cares she's great anybody starts locking shenaya twain i'll tell you right now he's an asshole right when you agree the question is unanimous on this show we love shenaya twain things we love shenaya here's the new poll George why do you hate George so much and we've got seven choices see he likes this his face just lit up like a honic a bush seven choices i don't i love George too much religion talk too much eating ass talk too much mumbling he's an anti-semite he's boring ishmit or he's an asy little spick i think that what all of you know he can't be all of the above because it's the first one as i don't so don't think of me this all of the but don't be messing with my poll okay first regret messes with my time slot and now you're trying to mess with my poll we should and you know who i blame normal can't that's why blame i'm blaming him right now how could you possibly have allowed this creature this man is treating with that holy keepscratchin is head which is why his hair is all fallen out among other reasons how could you have allowed him to dittle with success tend to two man it's like an american institution it's like the liberty well and philosophy okay so if i have a little crack problem it's an america it's like Niagara falls on the american side an institution like old yellow stone old yellow stain all of these things and Greg read comes along man trying to siphon again you know that's that is why we're doing uh in those four hours let's make a part of morning drive let's go stand up a little let's put him in the afternoon for a couple of hours and our program director after his unsuccessful debut of penis talk last like he's talking let's put the alarm from six in the morning till seven and night that's his that's his solution you could do it yeah once one day one day so now let's get that new poll up there the other one the other poll sucked where how do i come up with some crap like that i'm embarrassed in fact that's gonna be the forest poll which is more embarrassing meals first poll yesterday or those bedtime stories uh i like that see i'm not i have no problem with that i can handle it i still get paid the same either way and by the way where's those bonus checks aren't you getting yours today clear it's told me that they was bonus check day you're not getting yours not today how about the contract not today oh man we're picking on poor George who's already so put upon by this place with a tweet him like garbage like human excrement like animal excrement like something that you'd sweep out of it from the zoo in one of those cages that were it smell so bad like at the swapshop remember those remote oh yeah fun with those elephant days man oh god i'm sitting up there where it's the the mixture of the saw best in the elephant crap and we're sitting up there and they got the flood lights turned on on purpose and they're sure of nick in the press didn't his hand in the background cackling like a couple of hands because they thought that was a Gilbert cackling and I also him because they're enjoying our discomfort especially mine that's what those appearances at the swapshop used to be all about but we sure love the merchandise though five six seven oh five sixty and the crowd pound five sixty on the AT&T line here's Carl Springs hello yes sir uh a couple years ago you had like in December I think it was you went to a deal you could only communicate with you by facts yeah about four weeks and so that was actually entertaining however I did go away during the bedtime story good for you for coming back thank you all I was never a fan of George's in the past I look forward this past summer to listen to him he was when they run for four hours right see there's not a look forward to you George so uh I mean I did a the show is much better with the colors whether whether they could have bad if that's always was part of the entertainment that I enjoy exactly thank you so much sir and have a great life okay okay see there's a guy's honest we don't want no beaten around the bush today we want honesty so I screwed up bad now there were reasons behind it but I'm gonna even get a blame anybody else I take the four responsibility upon my slope old aging shoulders okay I'm not like one of these finger porters that's always looking to blame somebody else always got the finger up and here and which way can I point it who can I to at whom can I point it must be exact this week maybe it's Robert maybe it's Carolyn maybe it's the beast that fat little unprofessional piece of pud who can we blame it on this week right and George takes full responsibility for being a talk into much religion to much eating ass mumbling being a virulent anti-sumite and being boring and being an ass you little spick all of these things most of the new poll is up let's see what can I get a put on there you'll never know 560560 560 see I'm not gonna do that anymore I'm gonna wait here's Del Ray B. Chillo hey Neil yes sir you know you make some great points that guy is this guy doing for me I agree with what you said about you know looking forward to George this last time because of the reading but but at the same time you know George this last time also had his nuts guy cut off by not having a contract and you could tell during the show that there was a lot of stuff that he wasn't talking about that the people loved here you know the inside stuff yeah that was going on and he was you you talk about specifically about the mold business I think is what you're talking about yeah yeah absolutely how I'm trying to get him canned and it went through that whole sazer where like he was on the air but he really couldn't really get into it of course I'm going to play the race card and try to get me can yeah oh sure and the old day but all that was such great radio you know but yet you could tell it was kind of like the episode would be so too how the radio station didn't take advantage of the fact that they could have put him back on the air you'd lies the you know the whole thing and it would have been great radio you would have been for was talking from president would have been good right you know and they didn't take advantage of it everybody shut up and they freaked out you know and they didn't take advantage of what was there and as far as George and his personality you know I think he's just kind of bitter from doing the job for a long time you know what he takes the call sometimes he just like so sick of a clap you know you got some more on the other and the line and you're trying to get something going so if you have trouble with George as though he takes it personal I've been telling that he's a pretends that he doesn't but he does and even if it's stuff off the air he gets indignant I keep trying to tell him what difference is it making you're gonna to say that to say conflict on our holler said earlier you can I can't you get it you can't be fired I can that's exactly what I knew and I tell you what that's a big point you can get on here and pretty much say whatever you want in George and you have that freedom and if you did have that freedom I think you'd be a lot better so they need to sign a goddamn contract right do it get that thing in here now Greg God damn it quit per vacating whatever that means and it's for and the other thing with the I would go when you were reading it you know what happened when you would read is you know I would go home after you would read maybe I'd listen to shit or somebody else just switch around by the time the day would end I'd heard the same story three times I'd go to sit on the crap or read the paper I already heard this four times I don't do what I'm saying on the crap but look how we saved your eyesight for it they're not really I'll stay all of us but I mean that's the bottom line oh man that's from a listener who's in the list of for twenty years and sticks with you no matter what but you know and like I said I you know I like both sides of the story I want to hear the conservative side I want to hear the liberal side so at the end of the day you know I want to be informed but at the same time you know you want to comedy you know you only need one call you only one call to make your whole show one good call and you feed off of it and you can make the whole show the problem is you've got to go through twenty thirty people right and call even if it's a call it pisses you off it's a good call it you go no and that that's the best call absolutely okay listen thanks for your first vacation observations love you Bob I'd be right there see there you go there's I got it sticks with us to a thick and thin although he did go away he admitted that wanted you were going to those bedtime stories but we survived it somehow let's play Gloria Gander and we will survive you want to play that we don't have it I bet we do have it it's a little somewhere somewhere in this room how's the George pull coming why do you hate George so much we know a lot of you out there who don't want to admit it but you do because if you didn't you wouldn't go away in a summertime you go away and droves in a summertime even after the bedtime stories for months still many more one away you know considering how much they were looking for you not reading and of course he would have been reading thank god he doesn't read well because he would have been reading can you imagine the number you would have had if you would have been reading what number oh my god I think would have been a big thirty six votes so far he's boring his Schmidt 16 see I voted he mumbles I don't I love George 13 too much religion talk to too much mumbling to one of those is mine he's a national spik too he's an anti-semit one and too much eating as talk none so what is that way why don't I love George why not just I don't why do they have to love me instead of hate me why can't they just be ambivalent do you think anybody's ambivalent about you do you think anybody's ambivalent about me no no I don't I don't think so what we could we could also play if it'll make you happy what what's he falling on a floor about he got to he got the joke what joke you said is anybody ambivalent about you know what you see that was ambivalence get it I wasn't paying any attention I understand most of everybody else but how about another category or I know we're like read I mean two pulls in one day and we're interrupting his breakfast read-o feast but let's add on there I don't he's okay oh there you see I'll take that okay there's what we're getting right I promise that's it until the next one I don't he's okay they don't necessarily have to love you that's a good point maybe they think you're you know from some men's men's he's no kneel but they'll take and that's for God damn sure okay Jesus better than some yeah nine fifty seven five sixty wc ever having some yaks here today

In a twist with feet learned my man friend in the day. I'll just make up with generous something. And then ask him to break my bun. Oh, there's no other again. Though I would not feel the most old. And I would not be ashamed. About a ginger and more gay union. Just hold him and stroke him away. Boy, baby, you're not my type. Just sound like a nine-year-old kid. Only a much or many kinds. You don't notice? That makes me lift my wig. If ginger was a lover of mine. I'd bury my bogus baby now. Inside is a pimply rare end that's the day. No, I would not feel a sport-oing. Oh, no! If I was not a closet of a face. That's why a ginger and more gay union. Would they need a deal, give me a gay. Everybody follow my thousand balls. Yeah, ginger and more gay union. Would you stop? Would make my sorrow pony ass to sleep. If we had a ginger and more gay union. And they wouldn't have to get me raped. M-O-R-O-N. 10-02-5-60, W-Q-M-Happy Monday, too. And you see, look at that phone. Now, we had a couple of people on their way back to this again. They're not going to wait. They're busy now. You believe that? No, no. It's Monday again. That's six years. Oh, we're not going to hang out for you. See, I find this to be an extraordinary opportunity for the people in the audience, but they just even had they won't do. So don't be looking at me about the bedtime stories. Like I said, well, you people basically want me to do a city of big for calls every day for four hours. They love that. See, you're much as safe as I did. Let into that in the first place. Are you pardon? The bedtime stories. What led you to do that in the first place? Right. That, well, I didn't want to rehash all of that, but it happens to be true. Is that I found it to be not entertaining, not interesting, not anything. The city or after he puffed in the numbers all day. Are these phones working now? Or did something happen on the phone? So they're working. They're working. They're working. There's not one call on you now. And so if you wonder why, did only you take some calls, but you can't take any calls if you don't have any. And this is what led into it. Plus the effect of the world. Plus being on the 9 to 10 hour through us, the whole timing of the show off. And the 9 to 10 hour, when 90% of the audience is listening to some place else. And don't even know where on the first place. It's a hopeless situation. Thanks, Greg. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. On the AT&T in Verizon, wireless line. Traject, pathetic, sad. And then of course, in Amsterdam, when I'm sitting over there trying to take a member on, I had a rumor call on that one day. That didn't work anyway over there. Oh, you mean you're not going to be doing a show over there? No, it didn't work. That's one of the reasons of many, but it didn't work anyhow. Couldn't take calls. Sounded like it was coming under the ocean, right up the North Sea and into your back. Yes, is what it sounded like. Remember that one experiment? Yeah. Although sometimes not hearing rumor in all that. Pemberpines, hello. Please forget he did her. Yeah, that's it. Next Monday. You got it. Here's the West Palm Beach, hello. You get it. Here we go. Here we go, boys and girls. We want to go back. You know something that's timing this is perfect too. Because this is exactly what I was just talking about. Oh, gee, how come you were taking those calls nearly? Did seven months of bedtime stories? You screwed up the whole show. I can't imagine why. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. I got a whole bunch of bedtime stories here for today. I may have to resort to those, you know. I may just have to resort. Pemberpines, hello. Mr. Rogers. Yes, sir. The other day you were mentioned at Open Park. Oh, no. The rest went out of bed. Oh, no. Yes. Reno's. Yeah, no. Oh, you still have it here. And there you go. And there you go. And there you go. And by the way, President Washington is still shopping down to her cherry trees. Right there. There you go. Yeah. Uh-huh. Now, why would any person in his right mind not want to do this? Oh, look at this. I don't take fashes from the OK asshole from Hollywood. We don't take him. Idiot. Missfit. Mental case. Any woman on a phone yet? No. Living and breathing people. Now, see the credit just called again about no, no, seriously. The guy bought Reno. See, that's what I'm talking about. We could do that forever. We wouldn't have anybody listening. We wouldn't have any ratings. But we'd have colors. We'd have colors up the ass. Then we could do the new neurologist. No, we don't need to do that. All we need to do is just continue with businesses. Just get the, like I said, the L.A. pages from each year, 1941, 1953. Oh, look at this. These people aren't here anymore. Are they? Let's ask. Water here. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How are you? Okay. Hey, you follow this. Mary, am I a phone? Take great closely. The one? Mary. Very very emeliphant. Mary. Yeah, you're following a very closely. What do you mean? Very closely. Are we doing a great career? Well, I never try every time we turn around, it's a black thing. And it's worth going to this. Right. And I know that. I know that. And I know that. And she, she just can't do the job. I know. I'm like a deer in the headlight that we got the anti-missier on the front. Absolutely correct. You know, I said, it's like it's like, it's like, Broward County is being held hostage now because of the fact that she happens to be black, which has nothing new with their incompetence. That's exactly correct. I, I'm just, that's better listen to you here while back. And I'm telling you, I really enjoyed this. And come to find out by the way, wasn't just 100 votes. They found in a file cabinet. Now it's hundreds of votes and who knows how many more they'll find the hanging around somewhere. Then they've ever got counted. You know, if you, if you'd reverse things and, and the, and she was white and there was a couple of black people. She had fired, but it was, you know, like the two white guys, she fired that were her assistance. And they'd be a election come on. Right. By the way, my wife worked on that thing. What a fiasco that was. And, you know, then there'd be all kinds of help to pay. But you know, they want to be equal to, but they keep bringing up this is a blind thing. That's a fabulous thing. Now, people are keeping a risk card to turn my S sort of inside out. Okay. Have a great day. So you're hanging with me. Okay. Life goes on. One call I've done aboard is from Hollywood. As it's going to, this catches me off guard. It's got to be the Super Bowl, don't it? Yeah. All the Super Bowl parties. They're all like hung over in your all past and then when do we have to, how are they going to pay off all the bits they lost? Because they've been our Oakland like a bunch of jerks. I totally, I gave you a practical, really, the exact score to gain. Well, listen to me. Listen to all those fat old guys talking sports on his station. Are you on? Redwood guy who don't talk sports. Here's Hollywood, hello. Oh, man. You guys, you guys, you feel just a, I wanted it to make it coming back on. You bet that's the pressure if it's a ball. Yeah. As much as, and I'll agree a lot. I would say you can eat it at 90% of your followers. They do call it absolutely nothing of any value of the stuff. You have to put in. It's still a little bit for the most part more entertaining even in here. The dope stuff that live around here, make their comment. And I love to hear both of yourself and George comments about it. So I just hope you guys can see it in a technical moment. And we will. We will. You'll never hear no bedtime stories on this show again. We're all done with that. Oh, that was an experiment. That was an experiment that was a nightmare. That's that. That's that's that's a good. That's very good. And uh, uh, you fall to be in right. The deal for a lot. We'll see you. Okay. I want my 10%. Thank you. There you go. I want to 10%. That's why they won't want to call me because they all cash based on what I give in the score. 3421. Which it was with a minute and a half left. I had that thing analyzed perfectly. Even though I'm a federal douchebag. And they don't want to give me no credit because they're fail. I'm not going on there. Do one of my 10%. Just accept that. This is a gift. I'm the day of George's crucifixion here on the show. How many of you look at that? Look at the votes for again on it. I told you that other poll sucked. That was George's idea. The other one. No one. Why? And we got the new one up on there too. See, I told you that was a good idea. Why do you hate George so much? Now, what is that? I don't. Eric, can you get this poll right or not? See, when that, when that third stomach and the fourth sin get in a way, he can't read over to God. They're, uh, keyboard. He doesn't have this right. He's boring a Schmidt 53 out of 129. I don't. I love George 37. I don't. And it's supposed to say he's okay. But doesn't say he's okay. 10. Too much mumbling eight. He's an nasty little spick eight. Too much religion talk five. Oh, he's an anti-Semite for and he's a too much eating Ashtalk for it. And white blooded ale's not too happy about that. Do you think after we outed him about that, do you think white is still eating ashtalk? Is he alive and low? Is this about how he likes it? You're a man. The bad day to quit snuffing glue. Watching Trips go make she chill them sweat. Bunch of goofy me heads. Insist our pursuit. One roadie of kid and cowboy boots. When they saw her face, they all got the wordies. They said all I'd raise so much more. They're still getting good. Who will win? Who will win? Making a new wife, who get a whole life, who would he call? It was so much more than the dreams. Just getting to know all those 25 guys. It was incredible. They're all fantastic. One guy tried to buy her love with you, Lili. Others tried to fool her with time, Lili. One guy tells new movies. Another said that, Lili. It's a freaking household of laltine. When they saw her face, they all got the wordies. Now it's an all I'd raise. Who will win? Who will make it into a wife, who will get a whole life, who we call. 10. 15. That was another one. Just ends like a fellow off the edge of a cliff. Clarence just came in with my bonus check. How do you feel about yours, George? Oh, you don't have it yet? Or forl. And he also had a real good idea. Just to show you what a wonderful American I am. He says he asked me about the bed. I made with mad dog. I said just 20 bucks straight up. He picked the the raiders. I picked the bucks. He says, well, why don't you give it to Carlos? He was only joking, but I will. There you go. 20 bucks for just sitting there and looking ugly. And doing a great job on our website. What are you laughing about? It makes more than that at the carnival sitting there looking ugly. And the freak show? Beat doesn't have to work to do that. But anyway, 20 bucks says, so is the mad dog. Comes in which I'm sure he will anytime. Or not. Maybe he just maybe forgot about it. Here's the fact, this is I'd love to call in. However, since I'm at work in some high-rups, listen to you. I can't call in. I mean, in fact, the suction from this fax is so great. I just want to tell you not to be sucking up. I listen to you if you read newspapers. If you just talked, if you read food labels. Or read food labels. There is an idea that we start that tomorrow. No way. Whatever you do, I would listen. Most of the colors are worthless and have nothing to say. Absolutely correct. Go George, keep up the good work. Meals his Laura. Thank you, Laura. You're the kind of lady. You're the kind of person you're the kind of listener. We wish we had 75 minutes of. Don't we? Yes. Because Laura's easy. George? Really? How many votes we got on there? Why do you hate George so much? We're asking on earogys.com. Today we got 166 votes already. This is our second poll. We're going to get a big number man on the poll anyway. He's boring as Schmidt 68. I don't. I love George 43. I don't he's okay. 20. See that kind of like who's jumping in? Good. Good. Any more you might put up there to kind of like soften up. I don't. He's up there. He's not scared. He's weak. He's a nice little spick 11. Too much mumbling. Too much eating ass talk six. He's an anti-Semite five. Oh. And too much religion talk five. I don't understand that too much religion talk. Of course I'm not here when you're on and I don't very seldom listen. Even if I can like in Toronto. I don't turn it on. So I don't know what you're talking about. Listen what I'm on vacation. Neither. Well, what anybody in the right mind. Listen to the radio. Just like people saying, Well, you know, when you're in Vegas, have you heard such and such? No, I don't listen to the radio in Vegas. I turn on music on the FM line. I'm in the red of car. And I don't listen. I'm not going to listen to talk shows in Vegas. In addition, you know what they got out there? On a, on a, they got about 75 talk sports talks station. Oh, oh, oh, oh, at least I think they're. I bet on anything I ever move, you know, but I mean, oh, man, that's because they're only like 75 different people listening. So each day's and got one listener. Kind of like one of our shows five six seven. Oh, five sixty. Tarnished with the sewer of this place. 5, 6, the only AT&T in Verizon wireless line. Port St. Lucy. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Did the day I'm looking through the channel. So my television. I come across the travel channel. And I almost fell off the couch. It was a buffet plate eating contest live from Vegas. Complete with commentary. I saw that. I saw that. I saw it. Oh, my god. That was. And the guy saw it. Look at the way she attacks that plate. The tax of a fee. I don't, I, I, I unbelievable. I bet you were thinking about me. I was thinking about you the entire time. Okay. Thank you. I started this. I'm going to buy it. Danny, wait first. Yeah. I'm great, man. Okay. Keep it up. Sing a bite. Bob Herbert, I'm not going to wait because that'd be reading a bedtime story. But you can read it on our website, Neil Rogers.com. If you click on the stories, maybe somebody can read it to you. Falling into the gap in today's New York Times. I just want to read a couple of paragraphs. Can I do that? Yes. Oh, no. Mine is the poorest big city in the United States. How do you like that? I'm interested in all of this. Poor than Newark poor than Detroit poor than any city with a population of 250,000 or more. Most of the poor are working in many of more than one job. But the economy is lousy in the city is teeming with immigrants willing to work for extremely low wages. Even for pay below the minimum wage. So jobs are hard to find and wages across the board are rock bottom, which I guess you guys don't need to hear that. People are living on the edge paycheck to pay tax that Judith gotty. No relation to who you're thinking about. And that's called the same way. Directed the daily bread food bank. She read loft categories of people leading food assistance poor working poor families. Out of the men and women whose government checks are inadequate. Medley and physically handicapped people. Badered women. People struck me with HIV and AIDS. The homeless. She said 43% of those help by the food bank are children. The poverty in Miami exist in a starling just to position the great wealth. Just a few minutes drive from the panhandling turf of Adolfo Jose's ratio. Which they talk about or in the story. Are the sparkling shores of Miami Beach and a gateway to the pristine and violence of Fisher Island. And exclusive on clay that according to the 2000 census is the wealthiest community in America. Fisher Island. How about that? Fisher Island is off limits for everyone except residents in a bite of guests and whatever employees are need to keep them safe and comfortable. It's accessible only by ferry. And otherwise I could take it there. If Mr. Rizio showed up, this is a guy to eat out of a dumpster. He's having a hard time. He showed up on the dock and tried to board the ferry. He'd be angrily hostile. Huzzled away. And it goes on about Miami sucks. Basically is what it says here. A lot of slippers and a starving people out there. And a people on Fisher Island. Are they helping out? No. All they're doing is making damn sure they can't get on the island. That's what they're doing. In fact, right now we want to start a campaign on this show right here. Right now since we're helping Carlos out with 20 bucks. That Maddox is going to bring in his I1 ad bet. I'm going to take the example that I'm sitting here today and go out in a feed. Some slippers out there. Come on. Get on your ferry. Get on a helicopter. Come over here with a real people with a slippers with a starving desperate people and start helping some people out there. Even George has just gave a dollar to Carlos. Well he's homeless. That'll buy him another half of a tube of maybe one of those little economy sized tubes of toothpaste. Or it's a fiber. Woo! Yeah. Heavy duty. Why are like two big tubes of Pepsi? We need one of those big tip. And why do we? Aqua Fresh is a lot better in Pepsi. One. Yeah. You're right. Probably more expensive. One of those big tip glasses. Like the piano lounge. Yeah. That's right. Nifter. Let's have one of those snifflers man. I like that word. He sniffed there. That's kind of like that's like Shannon. I fall in there. Well it's the same thing. Shannon. I sniffed there. Yeah. Here's Oakland Park. Hello. What have we kind of a waste not to with their down or hands and knees all the time. Yes sir. Yes I am. Yes. Is this one or if anybody saw the news prior to the Super Bowl yesterday regarding the YouTube's pipeline crash and out of North Korea? Yeah. Wow. Is this one or if that was in the news today because it kind of they just kind of dropped it? Yeah. Well did you hear anything on that? No. The crash outside of YouTube's pipeline out of South Korea. Off the perimeter of the city. Okay. Well we'll check it out for you. Here's a fact that says this is a great article about Miami but I have to clarify something for the writer Miami's not a city. A city going to weft is a center of population commerce and culture, autonomous significance size and importance. Granted the population significance size are there but there isn't much commerce. There is zero culture when as far as importance goes. Not out to many outside they kind of read a notice of hurricane destroyed the entire city. How insensitive are you who ever sent this? This is really a shame because Miami used to be one of the best cities in the world. And this is a shame. Hey, man, you know, for lines here today is we continue waiting for your amelization of this past year on the show and on this station in this world. And this guy's talking to me and trying to come out of YouTube plane that legend you see that story? No. Near and I. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. And just like I said, every time you come in I've got my one, my bed from my Med Dog. It's static about that game. I'm in a great mood. I feel like life is almost worth it. And you come in here and you wonder about those bedtime stories. You just have to plead and squeeze and beg and control what is with you people. What are you doing now? I want you to look right down now in your crotch. Okay, what's there? Is there anything there? Nothing. Seriously, what's going on in this town? Makes me want to get on the goddamn plane to go to Toronto until I look on a weather channel and see it's minus 22 Celsius minus 30 windshield, which is like 17 below Fahrenheit. And I'm thinking, no, not yet. No way. What kind of crazy people, I guess people would have to. How do ones that go through? In fact, it's quite a commentary because many of those people are loaded with cash Began a money and they still endure that. They still endure that, rather than be here with our salty temperatures. Our salty temperatures. Here's a call from my spa and be. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes sir. You had mentioned putting out a CD with some of your bits on it. It was wondering if that was ever going to happen or not. No. No. No. Okay. You're welcome. Sure. 560. 560. Do you get the feeling? You really wonder what it is that's going on out there. I often wonder what it is. What is it? We've been doing that for how many years. I'll never know. I don't know if I want to know. I don't. I just don't get it. I mean, you know, that guy was obviously very serious. Right? Don't be scratching that eye curls. You have a, you have a shine around the other. Oh, just like the match the other one there. Pink eye. He's got a mouse on his cheek. That's a, is it? No, it's a mouse. What? It was sitting on most head this morning on the catalyle. Hopped out of his cheek. Here's Bokeh. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes sir. Why are you talking crap about like sports and how it sucks and gambling how it sucks and but you're going to go ahead and make a side there with NASA. 20 bucks. What do you mean gambling sucks? What do I ever say gambling sucks? Well, you always talking about sports. When did I ever say gambling sucks here? Don't I go to Vegas all the time? No, I go to a pop and a park and punch my guts. You're a jackass, okay, idiot. You got a person that was like a dead man. That's another one. And this is a younger guy that's still walking around on here. It died sometime ago. Nobody told him yet. That's one of the very popular phenomena that happened here in South Florida. A lot of people have already died, but nobody's given the information yet. They haven't got the bulletin. And why are you so anti gambling, Mr. 567560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon? I got no problem with sports. I've worn a jack strap in my life once or twice. Absolutely, the couple. But it's the obsession, the dissection, the rehashing, the stuff I heard this morning from these colors, the same old lifeless 40 or 50 idiots. The same about Dave wants that you take a page from John Grootten of a buddy. He sucks. It's all over, baby. Get out with something. Find a lot of these people going to talk about on this station. I'm going to tell you right now, the colors on this from day one since we came here. The colors on this radio station are the worst colors in this, your manker. And don't tell me about the sports or the old G. They have no problem. Because no, it's the same by the same misfits day after day after day. We got what's the guy's name? We got Jamaica Paul. We got fish. We got squished. We got Mishy fish. We got the same bunch over and over and over again. Saying the, in fact, the one guy this morning on there with the mole monster. Oh, I called her land or yesterday and said, and I just repeats the same guy there. Then you told him yesterday. As if it was so important mankind is waiting to hear it again. Where the hell did these come from? You sneak these in here when I wasn't looking. Thank God, I might need these. I have to do tabloor. Don't read about love though. Why not? Oh, I don't know somebody might like it. Oh, I see what you're seeing here. You see here one periodicals on them. These are not just your generic periodicals. This is sleaze on audio. They like sleaze on audio. They like sleaze on audio. A lot. In fact, they like sleaze anyway. They can get it. Flight six after ten at five, 60WQM. We started out here, man. I felt like a brand new child, you know what? And now I'm beginning to see the same old pattern. We're on us down. And Greg Reed, you're the one. Let's put the figure where it belongs. Just like in that polio. If you eliminate mole, which don't really come because they just hate him on a visceral level. Greg had a mess with success and we all got a pale wicked nasty price for it. And he's walking about, I don't know, I don't get it. I don't get it. You don't get it. You don't get it. We're the ones who are getting it. We're taking it up the old back to them tail. Power. Power. And he six has gotten a ratings party. Yeah, there. Power. And I just six is getting a ratings party down there. And I bet you kisses getting it too. Ah, they're probably going to be kissing cousins over there. We're not. QM's not getting a ratings party. We weren't number one. We were. I don't know. So I can't we just have an illegal and Georgian Carlos party, which I won't attend, but nevertheless, you can have my food. Okay. 1027 a QM.

My life and local, we're sports video 560's you a- You a- Chamberlain rate me. The makers of Joe millionaire comes a new show about 20 women. Fine for the heart of one man. This is like a fantasy country. But are they really after his heart? Faith that he's huge. Like heart is a down after he's huge. Yeah. He's got one huge secret. Joe mega Johnson. Oh my god where is he? Juneen as King Dong becomes tiny Tim. I can't even stir my drink with that. Joe mega Johnson. He's huge. He's huge. 1032 at 560 WCM. Here's a facts from Nelson who says two questions. Does the Mnet radio influence your numbers? The answer to which is no. No. And two, wait and hear this one. And didn't you support Bush Daddy senior before the 1991 Gulf War? Yes, I did like most everybody else after Sodom invaded Kuwait. Because that was an invasion C. He invaded Kuwait, a sovereign country and was also under verge of invading Sodia, Arabia and the whole rest of the Middle East if we just would have walked away. And yes, I did. And so did most of the rest of the world. And now, which is totally separate in situation, especially since during that war that you're talking about, we've decimated his military and he basically has his impudent. Right, no comparison. Of course not. But anyway, that's what you want to know. Interesting later that you brought me by the way, we'll, we can talk about that. Is somebody would say? Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Miami. Going once. Neil. Yes sir. What's up my friend? How you doing? Yeah. The city maintains those streets in city streets. So they're not, you know, supposedly they're not able, it's public roads. I mean, it's, it's just crazy. But people with money can go through. Well, we got that kind of money, man. You pull all the right strings. You know, you're telling me that all those politicians in their pockets, like done Corly on that's right. And that's, that's the funny part that those streets are public streets. So they're not supposed to do anything about that. Also are the streets in Palm Beach? Have you ever been to Palm Beach? Hello. They'll stop anybody in a heartbeat if you have a nice new Cadillac. If you don't look like you're one of the Kennedys or at least know them personally on a very close level, they're going to kick your ass right off of there. Have you driven down, um, bow harder? Done for the shirts and down there? Not anymore. I won't let my kind in there. I had an A3 view at the next stop, me and every corner. I'll be damned. I got two beautiful Corvets. They won't let me in there. Oh, Lord, Lord is Lord. What are we this world coming to now? Exactly. I love you. I love everybody over there. What? I'll see. I'll fish around in a me go. Alright, but when is this? Okay. Look at this. We got 600 open lines. We got one call from Fort Myers. What does that tell you about, Daden Broward? What is going on in Daden? I'm the same old stuff. I'm tired of it. I'm going to go back to reading bedtime stories. Oh, no. Don't do that. They can't, they can't even discuss that. They can, there's nothing to take in discuss. There's nothing that they have to balls to have to make. We had like three or four people there who like, you know, fall on saying and people fly. The people who disagree with me on this who did like it, they won't call because they don't have to get to disagree. Because they're afraid that I'm going to hang up on them and call them and ask for which I probably will, but nevertheless you're accusing everyone of sucking your ass then, but if they call and agree with you now, they're sucking your ass now. I don't feel it. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T line. This could be the worst response in the history of this show. Don't you agree? Sure. It's like the 27th of January. It's like not a holiday. It's not like something special. It's not like there's, you know what I mean? I mean that there's this is the absolute worst response. Now, if I was going to say, you know, we missed a lot of businesses that aren't in business anymore. We'd have every line by the frustration of 27 years, trying to do a talk show in time. This down. Finally got to me. And for seven months, I sat there. Mumbling to myself like I was going to change the world. Mumbling to myself. In fact, I'm going to blame George for that because he wanted me to mumble as bad as he did. Really? Are you right? Because one thing I have when I start reading, I read too fast because I feel like, like, I'm in a hurry. And I start reading so fast and to the point where it's like, you know, I don't understand a guy damn thing that I'm saying. That's why you liked those bedtime stories. You didn't even know I was talking about it. Because you guys were sitting in here. You weren't paying any attention to them. What? You're sitting here looking at a guy damn dirty pictures all day. I see what goes on here. See if the damn good thing I do come back here from out of town once in a while. I can see what goes on. And Miguel comes in here and he's looking at dirty pictures and Julio comes in and they're like holding up boobs and breast and nipples and stuff. Yeah, but that's in this room. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. So God only knows what's going on. See, and that's another reason. It's better for me to be into Ronald because then you're in here and he's in there. I'm the other side of the glass. I'm the other side of that. You're in there. His ass is on the other side of the glass. Right on. And I'm sitting here watching. And I'm sitting here watching. And I'm sitting here like, is anybody paying attention? No. No wonder they're not calling. They're listening to George and Carlos and they're going, fap, fap, fap, fap. Like that. In fact, that's probably what's on the air. It wouldn't surprise me. No wonder way these bastards operate. I'm sitting here talking to myself and you guys out there listen, which is probably more entertaining. I'll admit. I got the tabloids here though, so we could be dangerous. Look out. We're just talking about the Super Bowl. Here's Fort Myers. Hello. Fort Myers. Hello. Bad one. The guy. There were this. Okay. Call me back when you get a phone. Because here. Every third word when you get like 50% would be good. Every other would be okay. Anyway, it's been under the pants. There's a rumor. Sam at that. My entire idea that they worked real like crazy. They brought the ice export down here from up north from Toronto. And they worked on the ice. They had in fact somebody told me it was like 45 below zero in the macarina. The other night, which they beat Carolina. Created to an overtime. Nice going boys. And they're finally working to get that ice straight. No, I'm telling you. I don't see these things to try to be negative to read. They're not the mob because it's not an enjoyable experience to watch guys try to play hockey. Or they need to be on roller skates, especially with the all start again come up here in a few days. Oh, man. You think the super stars are going to want to skate on ice like we had here before. Then they got what's in there as big as somebody's back. Back was ass. I don't think so. So I'm just trying to give you some information. I mean, the franchise has been here 10 years. You think by now that have some concepts of how it is. So I put on a hockey game. They're working on it. They're a little slow. Speaking of slow here's Helen Dale. Yeah, see what I'm saying. It's sunny Rosenberg. He's still on a coma. Sunny still on a coma. I mean, be a fellow. Yes, sir. Is this Neil? Sounds just like Neil. Is it that? Uh-huh. You see, Neil, I have a question for your show. I like guys your age and call. But then the second banana is the third banana. Yeah. You're going to do it. I'm a second banana. I see. I understand you. I mean, when you said that when when Dale Evan's voice and if you're up in the inside with P.D. you find how picture with Roy Rogers from this and a guy I would allow. Yeah. Other people would have called it. And that goes right over George's head because it doesn't. Basically a reticent anti-Semitic. No, he's not reticent. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. He should learn how to say words like um, um, trower is okay. That I'll be sure passing along my a pedantic friend. Com trower. You better learn your company. Now, what is this? Is there something going on? I should know about it. Is like the building burning down? What? What? Who wants to know? Doth? So, but why? Let me ask you. Why can't he come in? I mean, I don't want to start picking on him. I'm off because he's okay some days, but he must add. He must add a very traumatic. They view on a show penis talk last night up against the Super Bowl. Think I'm having a tough time getting calls. But we got a break. Come out of here momentarily. Couldn't he come in here like during the break in the discussed that for 20 or 30 minutes? I said, well, until I kicked him out. I'd be glad to have discussed that. I don't know when would he like me to go back to Toronto. What time is it now? When will the temperature get even close to freezing? Would be an idea. I'm not going back there now. I'll tell you that. Minus 22 and a minus 30 windshield. I don't think so. Boys and girls. I mean, what's the sense of going someplace when you're going to do is like stay inside and turn a heat up as far as it'll go and look out the window and say, what days are going to get like to 25 would be good. Or here's the facts about Andy Rodicle. Have to get that momentarily. Good night's going Andy. We love you. Take off your clothes. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. What was that last guy talking about?

George said, here's a good call for your father for your father. What he said. And I think he had a good point. Grist for the mill. Old crusty Farts. And you can hear the poll of it sizzling in the back. Hey snow and Miami talking about cold while Tom Laman said in Joe Prieto both say that they're buried, not in snow necessarily, but in vehicles. The fact we have said how it so many cars is no place to park him. Even Tom Laman had a park car's in his driveway, so they need to place one in yours. How did this blowing out all the new vehicles?

What I said, he must be on those doggy upwards this morning. And her Zephax from our chronic WLL and Del Rey who says, After while I did not like the bedtime stories as much as Neil's use of the story for commentary, jokes and choosing bits to play, I was glad when the cause return Fox News had to be the best of me. That bitch. Jerome again, like got the big paycheck to him. His numbers also dropped. What does that mean? If WQM changes the schedule again, won't mad dog end up getting blinds at again, like he didn't want to replace his info with our David. The mad dog ain't going anywhere. He's got strong numbers in there. We love the mad dog. Oh, right. Go in nowhere. In fact, you know something? Nobody's going anywhere. How do you like that? We may shuffle the deck a little bit. We may move him around here in there. In fact, remember the old days? What, what station was that? Where they used to do that? You name it. When's the use of the... People's here? That's right. When you were trying to like to do to... And you know something else? I want to go nuts about this right now for like the next four or five, six hours. Do you realize cheap 10? Not only are they the bunch of bastards that we know they are, but... I'm in the car. Go into the track Saturday, okay? And this stuff with the worm is going on. The worm. The net is down. My computer's down all afternoon Saturday. What the hell is going on here? Is this some kind of a terrorist thing that's going... Nobody knows. So I get into the car now. Where am I going to get news about that? Good question. Yeah. Where? We used to have WINZ used to be all news. Then once upon a time it became all talk. And then when the clear channel bud, they made INZ like a make believe news at Talk station. And WINZ became all news. Supposedly. A ledge. Was it ever all news? No. Did they have any news? We said in the morning. They were watching a newscast. And on the weekend, pretty much forget about it. So what they've done is they've taken it, which is supposed to be the 11th largest market in the country. And there's no all news channel anymore. Thanks to Team Channel. And what they've done is they've taken INZ and made into what I minor league go sports. That was the last thing we needed was another sports station. You would have thought they learned that. But they don't care because it's Fox anyway. And they just opened up the pot and that's it. To what I'm saying. Cost them. Nothing. You just you can. And on IOD, what do they got? They got a local news in the morning. That's it. And the rest of the day they open up a pot. There's Dr. Laura. There is the big fat limbaugh. There's the Schmidt, myster from F.L.A. There's Phil, all of these people coming through a pot. Are you sure positive? And then that's what they give you. So if you want to find out what's going on there. They're going to find a news on this station. And if you wouldn't know if the goddamn world was coming in. Other than we got a TV set up here that Jeff Cohen gave us. We're so far out of touch that if we had a goddamn extension for our arm we couldn't touch it. That's how to touch. We are. Anyway, WL goes on Georgia was fine. He says, I still think that critics overrated him who would jump. Q sack that Cohen brothers are quite in Tarantino. What is that all about? I read that Andy Roddick now dates Mandy Moore. He says. You care about that? No. I care about Andy Roddick. What's that got to do with the Super Bowl? Let's see. Here's one that says Latin Grammys reconsidering Miami. Well, that's great. Latin Grammys do a lot of talk about that. No, we sure don't. Good guy. That's what we did. Yeah, enough already with that crap. See, see what I've always said about this place in the Wattacrepetition. The same stuff over and over and over again. Keep trying to beat a dead horse. Here's a call from sunrise. Hello. Yes, Neil. How are you doing today? I don't know if you discussed this or something on your website because I haven't checked it out. But the Riley column from the other day about George Clooney. I saw the headline in that, but I didn't see what that was right in the book. I don't know if any attention or a Riley was talking about was the fact that George Clooney said something about Charlton Estin and the other party. Good for him. And they're saying how people in this country can disagree without getting mean, started without getting down, keeping dirty. You know, we do the right thing, but these people don't. Right. And nobody remembers Dan Burton saying up and calling Clinton a scumbag. Listen, for anybody from the right wing in this country to be talking about venomous and all this other, all you have to do is look at Ken's star, for example. You're right. And it's just ridiculous that all you get is like you and whatever few people there are around the country that actually can speak to. No, no, no, no, we can't speak to two because they've worked been working feverishly to try to get my ass off here. So the fact that it matter is anybody to the left of a till of the hung under this new fascist administration we've got anybody to the left of Hitler. They're trying to get off there. They want to sign on so it's because they can't handle it. Well, they can't handle the truth. And I'm just wondering what's going to happen. You know, down the road when the reason nobody like you guys left. And I'll see you'll be in 1984. I'll see you at the Canadian border. Bye. Good luck, yes sir. See you around day. You're going to be the border patrol. Yes. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Let's play the race car. Let's play any card we can. Let's pull one out of the deck. And see if we can't get that prick off the air. What are you saying? Gonna work? No. We're not going anywhere. 284 votes for her on a George full today. Why do you hate George so much? He's boringish mid 166. How do you like that? I mean, that doesn't make you a bad guy. They're a lot of nice people who are boring, which is also a nice guy. I'm just saying you could be any of you both. I'll try to live in it up. Well, see right there. You see how boring I was Carlos? Yeah. There you go. Get it up a couple of locked. It's like, guilty. Look how well he's doing. Maybe someday you could have a number like his. Or something like his. That'll never happen. I'm sure. And you don't work. Not he'll see he's boringish mid 110. I don't hate George. He's okay. 67. Also good thing we put that one in the air. That's better. I don't. I love George 55. See it's becoming a little more lukewarm. Unless you keep putting the hot water back in the tub. It starts cooling off. He's a nasty little spik 26. Too much eating ass talk 10. And Maddie Bella still pissed off about it. Too much mumbling 9. Too much religion talk 8. And he's an anti-Semite 7. That's from the 7 Jews we got listening. That are still left. 567. 560. Pound 560. On a year. Hey, we're having a good time here. Whether you people want to or not. I'd like that. That's it. We're having a good time. It's quite of this time. And we'll continue doing so. Especially when I got that bonus check in my pocket. And Carlos got that 20 bucks coming from the Mad Dog as soon as he comes in a building. And the five that I kicked in. And the five that you 25 bucks. How do you like that? Why me for $2. You're halfway there already. 25 big ones for Carlos and it's only early on on day yet. So forget about what I said about you. Here's Weston. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. No, no, mind. Your show is just that. You curse quite a bit. Yeah. Is that a toilet flushing in the back? Yeah. Yeah. I just got a break. He just had a break. Yeah. But we don't want to hear this sound of your toilet flush. You're talking about me being a part of your gun. You're talking about me being a potty mouth. And you're flushing the potty in the background. Well, you kind of caught me with my pants down. Yeah. Well, I thought that would make it happy. No, would not. Not in your case. You're about 80 years to old for me, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. There he is. This middle fart. Fishing around in a wrong place. I'll tell you that. Five six six. Five six. Five five six. Five five six. On the AT&T. And Verizon. I know who that was. That was Mickey McNickle doing a voice. The fact that those are your pop at O'Parks, but your money on Mickey and what should go down the drain. Here's Boca. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi, how are you? Okay. Not your fault or your just fault. Hey, kid, don't start out by sin. And it could be our fault. Oh, maybe. Don't know the soft looks so easy. That is true. That this town, I should say, South Florida is a brain dead and constipated or both. Right. And you guys both do a great job. People don't realize that difficult about it is to put up with the crap that you put up with all every day and try to keep it entertaining. What I like to do is just talk about something that's dear to your heart because I haven't found out much about the new core of that coming out for the 50th anniversary. Yeah, I wish I could tell you I haven't heard a thing about it. I'm not really. Oh, well, wait. No, wait. The anniversary one was just last fall. I thought of. I thought of. I thought of. I thought of. I don't think so. No, I'm wrong. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's when I came out in the fall. And the new one is coming out is the new model. Now, I could be wrong, but I think they made some noise. You're using about it. No. Nothing. And the reason I don't know anything about it or nearly I'd be more interested, but I've already got two, two thousand and two or two, but whatever the hell they are. But I'm really not in the market for new one because they're both because I'm almost never here. So they have so few miles on them. And it's, you know, kind of stupid for me to worry about. I understand. But somebody will call. I'm sure. Thanks. The L-Hingon there. Let's get some new corvettes. Come on. But all I'm money. I'm going to make from that man. This fence. They're given it over to Carlos. I go down by a couple of new corvettes. For my good friend Greg Nelson. I'd loop back, Roach, shevel, up there by Pomp and O'Park. But because I'm such an ice guy, I'm going to turn that 20. That of course is assuming that man is coughs it up. Now, I'm sure he's a man of his word, even though he went to me, she again. And he was a real hard. All of a sudden, I noticed he's a big Tom Brady fan. Which I got news for a Tom Brady would have played a lot better. Yesterday the enrich can and did. I told you that. Oh, he's the most valuable player near the unalathic. He's overrated, okay. He crumbled out of the pressure against that defense. He's as immobile as a statue. Kind of like somebody else. We, you know, who used to play here. But at least they got to play it here was pretty good at a good arm. Rich Ganon. Not for me. Wouldn't pick him on my team. And what were you gonna say? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. Well, I don't want to get back under the Super Bowl stuff again. It's over. It's history. This station is drowning in a sea of sports. My new show. Nobody wants to hear my new show except people would know life. Geez. Just re-examining and growing. Oh, it's like, you know, I got to be honest with you. The guys don't do sports on this station except for one. But the rest of them, I tip my head to them because how do they tolerate it? Huh? How can they handle it? The same lifeless sport holes calling with the same idiotic. And I wouldn't say observations, but they're not even that. Can you imagine any other subject you could even attempt to do that? Sex. Yeah. All right. Now we're talking. Sure. That can understand that. I can understand that for like ever and ever. Food. All right. Yeah. Things that everybody universal. We want great food. We want great food. We'll even take mediocre sex and mediocre food. How about sexual food? How about sexual food? He's already forgotten about the sex that involves food. Well, there you go.

Uh, may talk to you another talk to you before but good show. Um, I had something in common with you. I've advancing. I have six or seven times. I'm just wondering. Um, the last time that you came back. back and you've been having problems in customs because there is a serious question. Well my wife was we came back separately from Europe this time last month. What is she a drug dealer? No unfortunately that would be that would be great actually but anyway we came back and she keeps just Canadian citizen and she keeps getting like stopped and searched in customs and I read a couple articles that said that like this new feeling woman was harassed and searched and stuff like that. So I was wondering if you would heard anything about that. No or if you're hearing what I saw was just there in December it's his laxes ever. When you get there they said look at you if you got in American passport sometimes they would even stamp it and they open it up and they stamp it if they feel like it and they give it back to you and have a great day and blah blah blah that's it. And then when you go through I'm and she take care a lot of luggage with her. Well no well actually I have to say this fine she did because she was a bad mistake. Yeah. And if you go through the green line when you go down into the airport out of the customs area anywhere says nothing to the clear they don't even most of the time 99% they didn't even look at you so I just have my one carry on. They don't even pay any attention to me but if you go through items to declare that all I would say is. Oh look out. Yeah well. Pack light. Well I'll tell her that I don't know. Maybe she's got a guilty face or something. That's why a lot more people are stuff in the drugs in their body cavities because it's a lot easier to get it through that way. Yeah actually one time she can't from counter with a cast and they held her for two and a half hours. But anyway I just wanted to say unfortunately we're away from civilization again but I hope to get back there and nothing but that's what I'm working on it. Hey we're the pleasure.

And I'm wondering people are complaining about the bedtime story Yeah No, I'm complaining about the bedtime stories I admit that it was a bad mistake on my part at herthisho badly desperately But it was a byproduct of how crappy the calls are Would you been here and how the calls are? That's my point I was driven to it People really want to listen to these idiotic calls I mean I've been listening this morning this is ridiculous It's a disgrace to the human race So go back to bedtime stories but lastly you know what George is a rookie everybody wants to compare him to you and that's why they say sucks he's not you right So I just say George needs some experience Exactly in fact I think starting a noon of even time to get him on there Hey exactly have a great day Have a Yeah, what's wrong with that you could do an hour today You could not hear a little bit early in fact I think like Tom Jekha said I'm gonna just you know I didn't go in my beautiful Corvette and head up to Hershey highway Where you ran out?

I'll share my opinion on the George topic Will you spell George with a J and I with a G you bozo? It's not that he's such a bad guy. We've been a bad talk show host. It's all in the voice It doesn't matter what he's talking about not to compare the two of you because that wouldn't be fair It's like comparing Superman to droopy I mean, you were blessed with that voice you have what what voice? I got a great voice. I wouldn't be here. I'll tell you that right now. Where would you be? New work? Your voice no matter what you're saying is very powerful and draws in the listener. It's powerful, baby He hurt George's voice it kind of draws in dead farm animals Just kidding seriously. He can't get away with a long unnecessary pauses even your pauses That there are more entertaining than when he speaks. Oh, no, that's bad. That's well. He's got a point though. The bottom line is George seems like a good guy See how he's sucking up to you now. What work? He shows He shows entertaining once in a while, but what he needs is a voice transplant maybe we can get a tool for you and jelly He's stealing your material. We can get a tool for already. What? He's stealing your material back to you. I know that. We do just stop. See that's another thing. They don't like about you. You're just intolerant Do some people take these people for what they are okay. You always be kind of like original material No, he wouldn't win. We ever say that We never said original material because you don't have any. Well, that'll be fun. It says gets a more energy more excitement George Okay, not it doesn't mean higher pitched. See you assume it. Forcible not high. That's squeaky Take more caffeine or do some operas. There you go. Call up Moses. So bring yourself. That's not my bag. Surgery might be an order. No matter what happens. These should take your lucky stairs. It would be a you were given that powerful voice But should be questioning every day how the rest of you turned out so poorly That's a good line. Just a joke. It says calm down. He has bring back screenless. No, thank you. Great. You were doing good. He got to that. He's right. How did I get such a decent voice and such nice feet from the ankles down? There you go.

Here's Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Mocha color brother calling. All right. Listen two things I want to ask you a couple weeks ago that was the last week that Greg Reak came on a radio It's one of the apologies for kind of Lisa. Is that it's in a little policy now what you can't talk about? Something like that. No. Okay. I'll say it again. I haven't changed my opinion about her. In fact even worse after the president came out with his University of Michigan business and his stand on the right of action and she kind of like waffled around and said well I agree with him but you know Reese is the fact there but but but you know it goes to show exactly where she's coming from I haven't changed my mind at all but again it's out of my hands. I need to look at comedy. I hate it won't be a leg no. No. Well I hate it. Kitten things are morning but I love that. Well you won't be here. I need to want them no. Nothing um and you wanted to know why sir because feedemist speeches did in this country. Of course. I'll have people who are really correct. But not because I'm taking over and this is an ironic that German in France will probably save us from this cowboy. Honey like what is that tell you? And another thing as far as what's the prime minister name in England? Tony Blan. Tony Blan. Yeah. This funny how when a trick was an office all these right wing of hated him like poison. Now of the sun he's the girl he's standing with Bush. He's he's great for his England and all the other stuff that's all. I'm Tony Bush's got naked pictures of Tony Blan and Prince Charlie and that's that's your reason he's sucking around. Have to be a keep up the periodic old one one thing the karaoke hour. Great idea. Yeah what about we'll wrap you the bill out? Sure why not. All right we have to clean up the lyrs a little bit though. All right see. All right. That's not a bad idea. What are we going to do that? Maybe on Mo show can't hurt. 560 pound 560 on a ATT a very weak performance by the Saudis on the Monday after the Super Bowl. That's because they're all drunk. You're all hung over. I'll piss off because they lost their ass because they bet Oakland which I tried to tell you I gave you I gave you the exact score like with a minute and a half to go which is all you need anyway. I gave you a Tampa Bay 34 Oakland 21 and then so they scored you know a couple of intersections they ran back as rich can and showed us two colors they're at the end of the game so they may run it up 48. As John Groot and stuff it down there throw it's obviously enjoyed doing a nice one our John. And these people they listen to the experts on this radio station you know what I'm saying? The mad dog.

Well there she is let's ask her ready is that's the down for your where she must be waiting for him is he picking you up after him last today by the way wish you good. They came from the wrong side of town they came from the wrong side of town. They told me he was the one never shake the shower a change to the towel. That's why I fell for the other act. One day my dad said buy someone new. I had to tell my dad with what you mean. I told him my cousin's way for him to go ahead and bump away. That's when he shot me the leader at the rack. There's the beast in the studio you have to in the updates. Oh you are always going to be doing the updates so what are clocking in today on the gym and it's show where is the mad dog is in here yet with the carlose of twenty dollars. They lost to me on a Friday pick it Oakland. I got mad dog boy what a loser. Here's the fact this is I think the biggest problem most people have with Georgia is that he's not you from one of our chronic factors. I like Georgia and think that he does a good job when you run vacation I would just rather listen to you as a half or a year now tell George to make the plunge and step the end of that coheba is what it says and then that coheba and after that it says. That's what it was sound like. That's what it says. He says snippet that's right I'm not going to use it anymore anyway. So anyway speaking about Bill what's his name O'Reilly and that business about George Clooney who first of all who cares what Bill or Riley thinks about anybody. Number one. Susan McDougall speaking out finally which is on our website on the enlarged.com today this is the story people ought to be concerned about not Bill O'Reilly opening up his stupid right wing mouth again. See this is the idea attack attack attack everybody who doesn't agree when Gustup and Aline attack attack and that's where it comes down to. It says for your Susan McDougall didn't talk not to prosecute is not about Bill Clinton's role in a questionable and Leo called whitewater for his salmon she's spent 18 months in jail for contempt of court plus three and a half months for fraud. She tells CBS News correspondent Jim Stewart wasn't an easy time it was not an easy time she's taught she repeats herself. But now she's telling her story and the woman who wouldn't talk. You could call him McDougall's revenge as to where it's more than her life story he says it's a bitter indictment of White House independent council can to star who led the battle to get her to speak. The pictures of her arrest in handcuffs and leg chains made her a public a pitiful figure steward remarks and McDougall tells him the shackling was tough to take. I wasn't prepared for that. I couldn't swallow or remember the tears came to my eyes and kept saying don't you dare cry this was a choice you made. But she says she we didn't have a choice she claims star as team wasn't interested in hearing the truth they wanted her to accuse Bill and Hillary Clinton the fraud. I believe they thought they had the goods enough to get him she says not the truth but the goods and I believe they went after him with untruthal witnesses with purged your testimony and I think they had their story. G.O. Time for McDougall was hard time some of its fed in America's toughest women's prisons like one in California where she was kept in isolation they called it the Hannibal Lecture Cell she says absolutely sound proof you could see out you could see in totally glass but she still wouldn't talk nothing I didn't tell them anything. She was finally released in 1998 she said she never heard from Bill Clinton until the end of his presidency when he pardoned her what would you say to him Stuart ask thank you for my pardon god bless you no animosity no if the only animosity I had is for the people who torture us there's been no comment from Ken Star McDougall's story Stuart has asked for McDougall's he says she's back in Arkansas try to pick up the pieces of her life that's the kind of fascist you're dealing with in Washington ladies and gentlemen the people like Ken Star the witch hunt crowd on the right oh George Clooney is this and this one is that and Scott ridder you know it's how just that story about his arrest how they just came out just recently right just attack and attack and attack anybody who dares not to go step in line that's what you got now freedom of speech my ass and that guy to call a couple of days ago oh gee how can you be so negative about prison of course he's the best thing he'd come down in a long time while I got news for if that's the case we're in deep crap if he's the best thing we got boy how is it possible for the be so many stupid people in one place of course you know but her six is on level you know how that works here's a call from Palm Beach hello hey don't man okay sir I really like George I think he's just so when he was on when you were on vacation it was pretty cool not better than this one oh man what are you talking about George is good right you had a preacher on a show not like as a guest somebody called all day and then easy just with killing the excellent he's okay all right not great he's okay have a good one I think there's a guy sticking out for him and this guy's like so not a fazzass but that's good we like that I don't think that's my crowd so you're proud all right stowed off his ass probably on his way to Amsterdam probably gonna hang out behind the central station but all those drug addicts all those scumbags those subhuman whatever they are I won't it'll be right there on the damwreck where used to be what's the name of that place at restaurant I was still there to markies don't need it to markies if you go to Amsterdam please if you go there don't play me to markies fair even the Dutch say that fair 513 votes on George's poll today it's only 12 19 that's a pretty damn hefty total considering we started this was the second poll today are we glad that we smith can that first one I do that that was so we over huh but that's just me just you what I thought I was it isn't because it had to do with the Super Bowl it's after the fact it's dull it's boring it's like people talk about sporting events long after they're done you know like people are continuing to rewatch the last minute of the hurricanes oh how is state game I mean get a life get a life of course these are the same people of like golf twice on a weekend but anyway seriously if that's the best you could do with your life was go out what had got fully loaded gun what did you do yesterday I played golf what at least they were yeah but I played golf with uh Brett Hall aren't you impressed? I played golf with Bobby or 513 votes why didn't he George so much I wonder firmer voted on this speaking of playing golf with Bobby or he's boringish mid 180 in fact if we just have one that says I hate him like poison unlike a person level remember what a vote of that which is why he's never going to buy you that lunch I think the main reason is not going to buy that lunch is because he's so cheap yeah you're welcome by the way remember for doing that work for more work you remember for a whole thing that got me the lunch in the first place supposedly what was that remember somebody was bad mouthing his son and I listened to hours of tapes and dubbed it off but he didn't have to fall a lot of loss to yeah this is the same guy and don't have to fall to help us get our money back from somebody he recommended to me which I don't want to mention the name on here oh I'm going to do it today yeah right but well at least when you live in the 900 thousand dollar house like he's gonna have to worry about losing whatever he lost so you should have hit me off about him oh you know this jeff high's neighbor you know we're gonna do the use here so I'm gonna send jeff high to your house and just have him sit on you that's all that's all I'll tell you he's done that all right and maybe you like it I think I learned a lot to let her out of it sit on you put whatever one in there you

the middle that's fine is something the ones that show up on the river is playing or not but good luck you i show up at the you think it's a good the same thing was what they did like to found around the game was a snap at the river telling the building that they didn't come and then i was like there's a good thing with those that was saying where they're going to where he's going to be in a uh... they never say they wait a minute they never said they killed or some of your mom and they never said that all of them now you have a lot of right players are saying that they did based on what well

I love it Senator Hillary Rodden Clinton launched a blistering critique of the Bush administration domestic anti-terror effort Friday same the nuisance a nation's new home-line security plan is a myth and a cut-reasony marginally safer than it was before 9-11 our people remain vulnerable nearly as vulnerable as we were before 9-11 New York Democrat told audience attending a Homeland Security conference at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan We've relied on a myth of Homeland Security a myth written in rhetoric in adequate resources and a new bureaucracy instead of relying on good old-fashioned American ingenuity might and muscle she said the truth is we're not prepared We're not supporting our first responders and our approach to securing our nation is haphazard at best she said somewhere along the line we lost our age we let our guard down is what she said and she is and you notice now how all of a sudden the gloves are off and this teflon business now that the uh popularity ratings are down like 54 55 percent the teflon is like falling apart it always does screen better late than ever Hi Ali a hello hello yes sir hey how are you doing good as one say that George is awesome and you guys make the station all right we agree we're horribly yeah i'm a who deal from highly and i just want to say i've listened to you since i've been 14 years old all right and you guys are awesome right thanks a lot of me go all right thank you all for your late okay there's a great subject from highly a tour to the course from highly of the best in i tell you that i've always saw the tour best by test breast good guy loves you and he loves me like crazy and he survived he's been listening to the show since he was 14 years old and he's still alive how do you like that it's quite a volume of you many extra there to talk about i'd be listening to that and it'll write your brain yeah you should listen along look at a vote so on this thing for one thing about George man like i said there's no man be pambi there's there i don't care what they say about he's okay and that's anyway why do you hate George so much we have studied because he started to take it personally a little bit of stuff he's boring as Schmidt 200 people said you're boring 34 percent boring which you can't help that it's just you i'll try i mean even when it comes in the morning before the show he's there bambi bambi bambi i think i think you boring i don't hate him he's okay 156 i don't hate him i love George 114 so put those two together got 45.7 percent you're approaching 46 percent which of course he's a little more than 54 percent who have like some practical things to say toward you for example he's an assy little spik 48 too much eating as talk 22 he's an anti-semit 20 20 too much mumbling 17 and too much religion talk only 12 so i think if you go by this next time you're on a lot more religion talk mumblet and uh... ripped the juice but other net huh well you got a little even i'm always talking to you wish asked there you go there's the great topic for George's next appearance on his show eating jewish ass for palestin in fun and profit that of course if you're doing a talk show while you're eating jewish ass you tend to mumble yeah well always try to tell him don't talk with your mouthful so anyway what did mad dog call me but the second part was a what what sucker come on man i don't know read in the face yeah of course i have no problem with that no problem that whatsoever i and i heard he knows time radio close in personal matter fact maybe introduces but the fact of the matter is it was like taking candy from a baby you know what it really boils down to see last year he didn't like to pay to it's you want to why jealousy see i find this trait in this time to be very is one thing if you want to feel that way it doesn't cost you any money and so good thing he's not one of our big degenerate sports nerd gamblers like a lot of other people on the station because he be broke he'd be barking money he wants to twenty back from Carlos he always how it rickled up and dusty that thing was he gave you and the money too for last year i didn't like to pay for its because of jealousy or they got lucky in the Oakland game that he cocked and he tuck into the uh stick it because of the fact that it's not not that often see in the fc's so it's a jealousy factor wasn't us it was them this year it's Tampa Bay who's in Florida see being a Florida team and not being the dolphin so therefore that he's allowing his emotions to cloud his judgment and when you're talking about gambling about making a tangible uh... gesture you can't do that follow him saying what do you say it would be like going to the track you go to the track you vote on a cute lady in jockey okay because he's cute that's all she's been a win the race right see what i'm saying but she's cute but you said in other words you like to put a few bucks on a rass but that's beside the point do it after the race so my point being it was like taking candy from a baby anybody who really knows the game anybody who saw the way that that team twelve and four in a regular season just awesome unbelievable the fence of powerhouse crushed rich gannon like a like stepping on an ant like stepping on a net and yet i got twenty one points for one of them was the uh... the black tami tupa who's my these the weeklint contemporary get rid of tami tupa he plays more like they're in pupa tami tupa that one black pun running for a touchdown right away and then of course jury rice they felt sorry for jury because he's on a way out so they know a lot of my it's a touchdown late in the game but other net ask kick in baby and Carlos has got a big smile on his post the easiest twenty dollars you will ever make in your life like i said okay mad dog and i got to be doing some schedules switching here pretty soon anyway he's coming long next you got hang from Vegas at three and then after that you're on your own if i'm gonna suck on something it's not gonna be an oyster
