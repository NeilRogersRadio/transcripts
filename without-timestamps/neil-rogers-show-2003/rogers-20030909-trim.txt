Yeah, everybody on this end. Yeah. Yeah. Some rubber creeper. Yeah, we go through a little temper tantrum today. He fired by the way. You know that, I just fired his ass and also the beasts is going out to go with him. That's Clarence's boyfriend's boyfriend's. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that would be great. I could break up that old gang of little children. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I think that there's potential for that. Yeah. I saw the reaper out in a market. I would like to ask you, I'd like to learn a young guys who'd be at the door There's sports, uh, jock type, young guys who just, they probably worked for free. They probably paid a station to work there. Oh, you mean like, you mean I got, yeah, right. Guys who work for free, they don't want to work for free, but they want to do it. Yeah, Scott's working for free because he's not part of Clarence's little fraternity. That's why Scott's getting married. I think what they're doing to him is a legal. He's got if you go in there like, lick Clarence on the ass a couple of times. Maybe the finalist generals, maybe he might put your ass on a payroll. Work for me. I listen, I feel it for hammer for one day and they give me morning drive and change five shows. There you go. So I figured the only thing that really mattered in the end of the day was that I was able to support Neal show. You got to have a great lead for the leader and with the two of us who cares about anybody else. Right. I understand God. I heard that most Crochraught was acting up. That's why Jesus said you don't have on it around this place. That's why I'm on this place. I'm on this place. I don't be laughing beast your dog. I'm just going to say, who are you taking beast? Just have a crap game three pounds. He went to the game on Saturday and he got so excited. He sprayed his ankle and got sick and this worked money. And then the Howard David, it is wife yells at him. That's his work. I think he'll the spray is. How does he miss work when his wife yells at him? Probably. I've worked here in ninety five days in a row. Maybe we can get the peace clue on straight today. Maybe the weasel have crawling down his forehead. You know what the best thing about working here for me was Saturday. I had to go get medication at the pharmacy because of illness. I don't ever miss work. But I went and my bill would have been 75 bucks. But they had sent me my health insurance card. These people have easily. And I got my. I got my prescription for 10 bucks. And so I saved like 65 bucks. And I got to go back to the war beans and get my money back. That's it right. That's the best thing that this place has ever done for me. Excellent. That's probably the only thing that I've ever do for you. They got your car yet? No. But they want me to try today to candle, which is like driving to Europe for me. And that's not going to happen either. Here's Johnny Morales. I got bad news for you. Johnny give me the car or I'm not going. It's simple. They got your wants to do the deal. You're waiting for Johnny Morales to get you a car. No. What's in here is it now?

The directions, uh, you take on 85, the debut Boulevard, East, US, 1, south on US, 117th Street cause. If you don't know where we're up here 66, is a shame on you. But you think everybody knows where it is? Absolutely. I'm parking on a west side at the Quay Shopping Center and Public's or Harbor side of the south. High is on the east side of the bridge.

Once to raise a million dollars in four hours in Broward County. In, uh, Wow. The goddess will be there. George will be there too. Except he's busy trying to get Scott paid. I don't know. I mean, somebody's got to get him on a payroll. It's, uh, you know, I think he should go in there right now and just whip it out in front of Clarence and I put it in motor. I'm serious. Just don't, I mean, don't let him touch it, but just let him look at it a little bit. That's only where you're going to get on his good side. Take a copy of him on his side. No, it's, it's unfortunate that we have a program directives like about 10 years old who's involved like a bunch of UM children like Robert Greeper or in the beast and all these other juvenile sports nerds. And as a result, the good people that come in and want to get paid and act like adults. And we like it. I'll do something constructive in a place. Oh, they can't do anything because there's Clarence and his little fraternity. We got too many clicks in that place. So I'm talking about. No, we're not on a spixion too many clicks. Where's the other way around too many spix? Whatever. I don't know. Anyway, here's a pool at the Sun Sentinel is taking. I love it. I love a result, man. A public, maybe a little bit slow. He where can people, but finally catch an eye. Yeah. Catching on. El Presidente. I'm delighted that he's in South Florida. I hope that somebody passes along the message from the show. We hate you like poison. Okay. You suck. Ronda. Some of us have been on him for a hell of a long time since they stole at Vogue's election two years ago. Pulling the Sun Sentinel says President Bush is asking for another $87 billion to fund operations in Iraq, which would push the federal budget deficit to a record. $562 billion for 2004. Our Bush's fiscal policies out of control. There are two choices, obviously. Yes, his tax cuts and spending plans of transformed a budget surplus into potentially runes deficits, or no. No, Bush has been doing what's needed to shepherd us through recession terrorism in the war on Iraq. Well, guess what? Guess which one has $70.9%. That's the one. Yes, his tax cuts and spending plans of transformed a budget surplus into potentially runes deficits. $29.1%. No, no. Only $29%. Bush liquor's now. In a sense, a lot of $3,500 or $35.0 responses. How do you like that? Something? Good. I'm not to make here, grow on your ass. But not to make me vibrate. Public is starting to finally catch on, Bush, Myster. Okay, they're on you. You're out. You're absolutely out. You got two chances, none and much less than us. So forget about raising all that guy. They money. You know what? Really frost my fat ass. I give up. Far away, there's this British, I forget the name of the group. But anyway, the story is coming out today is about how the, the al-Qaeda is stronger right now. The reorganized, they're stronger now than they were before 911. We still have a god Osama, Yamama. We haven't got Mula Boa Omar. They're stronger and they're like, God, they'll kind of devious plans. Those are Governor-atulosa. He had Virgo. They have devious plans for us. But in the meantime, what are we doing? We're wasting billions and billions and billions of dollars and hundreds of American lives in a war against a phantom enemy. That was never a threat in the first place. Can you imagine if we were spending those billions of dollars on real homeland security? Can you imagine that? Yeah, imagine it all. I'm really sick, and we need to go in after Al-Qaeda. But we have that problem of the bush family and the bin Laden family. You know, it's bush in the house of Seoul. It is really what it's on. That's the background of all of it. There's a real real sugar in the wood pile with this whole thing. That's what it's all about. Oh no, but there were a rackies at 911. Oh no. No, they weren't. It's kind of like the Humpty Dumpty syndrome. It was like all the pieces are broken. Now he's trying to put it back together again and can't do it. And now he's running the same people he was thumbing as knows that. You know, you either would as you were against those. Oh, well, come on. Won't you help us out now? Come on. Send us some troops and some peacekeeper. Send us some money. Please. Because we're drowning in a sea of debt based on this phantom war that we thought was going to be so easy. How come I'm getting so serious all right today? You know, I don't know. I like it. Good. Because I got a whole bunch of crap here. Okay. I'm not no more for bullcraft today after hearing about Robert G. Brewer's temper tantrum. Here's a guy's got more lives than the everybody can't. Yeah, at least. That's right. Can't stand that punk. Joe Costello was right about him. Joe's a pretty good judge of people. You know, he's show blows, but he's a good judge of people. I like Joe a lot. And when he said Robert G. For oughta get his ass canned man. He had his thumb right on the magic switch. Get him out of there, Clarence. Start break it up. There's a little band of boys. It's like a, the, the boys in the band. That's what Clarence has going there. Remember that movie? That movie a hundred years ago. Our bag movie. That's what Clarence's got like a gay club going on there. Gay. That's exactly correct. And you know, reason we, we don't see Clarence anymore. He's busy. You're looking for glory holes. That's what he's doing. He's not looking for freaking glory holes. Because at least they can't run away. And I'm single stationery. Once he starts humpin' uh, they can't get away from him. Although the room around town is that even a glory hole. So they kind of like see a lot when they seem coming. 1186 votes on yesterday's pool. I have, I have my, so worked up on it. So I have no idea. Good. It's your responsibility. Vitamins. You know what is calling poppino is going to be bogus. Here's poppino. Hello. How you doing now? Pretty good. I just was wondering how much is going to cost us taxpayers during the rush hour. Shut that all the major highways around the airport. Shut down the airport and shut down the airport and shut down the and a ghost or put it. Probably millions. You know how many millions? I've turned man. Yeah. It's ridiculous. And you know, he's going to suck so many out of his rich friends. Well, I was milk when I feel the driving spent from work. They're going to get stuck. Sir, let me tell you something. Will you use the appropriate term when you think about this president's suck is the appropriate term he sucks? Yep. No doubt. I hate him, but for him. And I shouldn't have won't be voting for him at this time around. Amen. In fact, next time, those of us who voted against him last time, we're going to vote three times just to make sure this time. Hey, in Florida, you can do that one out. That's right. If an amen. Okay. Thank you. See you. That was your real call. Kind of. It's a pissed off and fired up on the stops. Let me do the. Why won't he have a little faith? Of course, I didn't have no faith either. Still about half of the town is laying out their gun and who the hell can blame him? 13 past 10. We'll give you the poor results from yesterday. We got a poll today that doesn't need any ad. I don't think it does. I don't know. I think it needs no addition to you. You can put the new one up here. I naturally printed out the one from yesterday. So it doesn't like it's scape me. Because Thursday, two days from now is the second anniversary of 911 in this al-Qaeda business. How come all these business and hours being wasted. They're stronger than ever. Or we hear in just a few months ago that we've cut off the head and that basically they were like disorganized and they were no longer the threat they used to be. And the idea. We're here that crap. Yeah. Well, guess what? Surprise. Surprise. Those evil doors are out there. The real evil. There was the ones that we haven't been going after. Except for the ones that were feeding the McDonald's down there at Guantana. Get them. Hmm. That's what they all want them. They want to get more for their money. Hey, you'll get more weight loss with balance for life. You know, the beast I've written him off for the last time. No more chances. Maybe he can a little bit robber creeper and a clearance. They have like a three way. They can work off the way. That's the only way that fat tub of crap's gonna lose weight. Now, where you fudge back him? Are you one of the millions who built with sick and bloated off and constipated? I am so constipated. I haven't gone in a week. If you have a crane of abdominal pain or discoloration. It feels like I've got a pool of what my ass. Wow, you do have a poodle of your ass. Ask your doctor about getting relief with zelma and move zelma on keep me from putting poodle of my ass? No, Mary it won't. But it mentioned easier for the poodle on the way out. Zelma, you're suffocating. 10, 19, at 5, 60, WCM happy Tuesday 2. We got the mad dog at 2 of the Humphor, and the baby is dead. It's not a good thing. It's not a bad thing. It's a bad thing. 10, 19, at 5, 60, WCM happy Tuesday 2. We got the mad dog at 2 of the Humphor, and the baby is dead. We got the mad dog at 2 of the Humphor in the studio at 4. How many weeks has it been since the Humphor has actually been in the studio? I'm good man. Another tough timer for Hank. He's got 2 and a half hour show of 4 to 6.35 because the Marlins on deck. The wild card leading tied with a philly Zelmaarland. Study like that. Ready for that? What? Marlins of 6.35 on deck then the game at the Metz 7.10. Each game becoming more and more important. Now, it okay follows the game and Joe Mark overnight. And then maybe Moll will be back tomorrow, but we can certainly hope not. Absolutely. Because he's got bad crackshot now is what the deal is. So he's not sick this morning like a real pussy man. Every time he gets a hang nail every time his wife looks at him and cross-eyed. Oh gee, I can't come in no more. We can only pray for that, you know. So here's the results he asked today's pool. Who was the greatest fictional character in movies or TV? We asked long list here so I give Moll yeah why not. James Bond wins no no contest 286. Can't argue with that really, right? No. How many years is James Bond and go on? About third man. How many different actors have played James Bond? About third man. Archie bunker 101. That's good. I like the way Archie bunker moved up later there into a good second place. Superman 97. It's a bird. It's a plane. It's a time-wallings. Foot. Why? He's got big feet. He's got size 14 feet. I thought you knew what they say about it. It's got big feet like that in the big hands. Oh my God. They got big shoes. Wow. Can you even imagine? What's that thing he dragged through the tomato soup? I don't know what it is but by now probably is sure tasty. Darth Vader 84. Bugs Bunny was a late edition on there. Thank you very much to the guy to recommend it. Bugs Bunny's got 72 votes. Right. That was brilliant. Because ordinarily wouldn't think of a cartoon character necessarily. Right. But Bugs Bunny is legendary. He's been all over the place. Sucking down them carrots. Indiana Jones 63. Shylock home is 55. I love Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. And anybody else who plays Sherlock Holmes are we like there's another John Carrotting role. And he also do that. I don't know. He was like a rip by. He ripped off everybody. I know. There was a Peter Cushing. Peter Cushing. Yeah. Hammer Studios. Peter Cushing. Michael Corleone in 45. And like I said probably would have done better except for the fact that you know there were other characters in the same movie who were more prominent. But I mean tell you something my craft make friend exactly. Even a horse's head I think was like more prominent than Michael Corleone. That could have raised him though. Cartoon. Cartoon. Dirty Harriet 42. He was just a cartoon character. Michael Corleone 45. Dirty Harriet 42. Batman 36. To the batma be a Robin. And by the way, just those tights something's flopping out. Dracula 32. Inspector Clueso had. You know what Inspector Clueso had? But third man. That's exactly what he had. Yeah almost passed up that opportunity there. That would have been bad. Captain Kirk 29 votes Lucy Ricardo. Now that's interesting Eric actually put her nice last name on there like it would be some other Lucy. And again he's right because it could be Lucy from peanuts. Was it right? I emailed him Lucy Ricardo just to be thorough. Speak. Lucy Ricardo 23. I was a character's name. I know just don't get all out tight like I said up tight little bit. Ralph Brandon 21. Mad Max 19. How's that? Is that where we got that thing from? Where we got what thing from? Touch the button like. Oh that's the great race that's uh, keen and win. I know. I love keen and win. I like Edwin's great. You've even even even when I have no idea how. I'd watch old TV. He was a panic man. He was a funny funny guy. He was goofy. He's dead. Fred Sanford 18. He's also dead. Bullwinkle James who still lives 16. I think that's underrated. I think Rocky and Bullwinkle was the greatest show in history and television. You don't even uh, and it's older than me obviously. So I was watching it in syndication. Even at the time my peers that was going over their head. Nobody liked it as much as uh, like I did. And just a few of us. Now, W do right was a separate show, right? It was uh, it was been a ring. You know how they had the bullwinkle adventures. The Rocky and Bullwinkle. Right. In between. They had all these other features like uh, fractured flat flurry tails. Right. And Dudley do right. Edward Everett narrating. Right. What a. And Hans Conrad. Oh my god. You know something. The like I was telling me before the show this morning. I need a lobotomy because my mind is so filled with you. That's crap. And I'm important stuff that it is the horse racing. Yes. Hans Conrad. Now the horse racing is very important to me. You have no idea. Me and harness racing are like uh, butter and bread. We are tight. Lucy Ricardo 23. Ralph Camden 21 Mad Max 19 Fred Sanford 18. Bulljinkle. James was 16. Mr. Spock 15. Spider-Man 14. George Jefferson. Godzilla Colombo Rocky and Freddy Krueger had 10 apiece. Tarzan 9. 8-8 for Frankenstein. I don't know. I'm sorry. I mean the audience did pretty well on this. But I think all the 8 for Frankenstein is like uh, some of them a little bit short. Old hat. What what does that mean? Old hat. He was a popular monster back then. Yeah. But not sure. They don't they haven't really like in a long time. Right in a Frankenstein movie. Last one probably a young Frankenstein. Wouldn't you think? No they made the young. The young Wilder which we loved. Gene Wilder. We still feel really bad about what's in Rosanna Dana. Why not help him to have been alienators in a Dana that would have gone to that big uh, uh, right wing bullcrap thing in the sky and left the killer right in the Rally. I love the builder right in her man. She was great. You know? And Gene Wilder. You feel bad. You know what I mean? She died a long time ago. I'm sorry. I'm saying. I'm watching. I'm not static now.

Lot of apples I keep saying that in the reason being that I like a good apple now and cold. Yeah, I've room temperature cold. I heard down the yellow hair. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless life. California crowd hostile to Maria Schreiber. How do you like them? Apple's. Good. Oh. Man. Lot of crap going on baby. Lots and lots of crap in a good old USA. And a public is going like that. But the good news is that slowly but surely there are more and more people waking up every day. You know, like a little light bulb went off like right at the top of their head. Like Ronald Reagan used to say for GE and that's it. Like a little bell started ran. Oh, guess what? There's some heavy duty crap even lied to like crazy and are like fleece and us all kinds of money. And they're giving tax cuts to the rich and all of our tax money is going to like this funny, balloony war and killing all of our kids and boochering thousands of innocent people. All of a sudden a parent suicide bombing your army base in Israel. Oh, how unusual. Unshot. Like I've said for years, let us get there a lot of there. Let's start taking care of we be important business instead of pandering to this group and that group and this lobby and that let's start taking care of our own business. In fact, if we to kick our nose out of there for a long time, it's going to be booch when you tell the other up and nothing. It would be any different. Said we'd be a hell of a lot less hated than that we are right now. If you catch my drift, I caught it. Here's the call from Delay Beach. Hello. Hey Neil, how you doing? Okay. You know, this was just an opinion of a guy. I'm somewhat conservative from moderate and I supported the war and I rack at the beginning. But now I'll tell you what you looked at retro spec. I don't care how you look at it. The fact is that the United States got stuck. Then, like the Donbou's saying, so badly with this whole thing about weapons and mass destruction and all that, how they really aren't there. And he had us all of our intelligence totally do, but it is there. And we look like a boy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But you're wrong. He didn't have anybody. Do we knew that it wasn't there? We, I mean, we had Zillions of reports that we knew that he didn't have any weapons and mass destruction. Do you expect there's tools that? Huh? But wouldn't it, I mean, wouldn't that be so stupid to know that? And then going there and do this anyways? No, it's not going to find any of that. Sure. I hate to burst your bubble because you sound like an intelligent guy, but they lie a lot. Just like LB J. Lied about Vietnam and just like the media helped him out. The same thing here. Same thing. Same thing. But administration lied in the media. It would, uh, MSNBC and CN operation Iraqi freedom. It all these other, and then they had the big wall and MSNBC all the heroes coming back. It hearts and flowers flying to flag, playing the hearts and the stars and stripes forever to violent. You know, they, they're American people, but led down the garden patty lied. And now they're caught up in their own lies and they have no way to extricate themselves from it. This is a quagmire that we're now. Oh, there's no question about that. Now, the people that you got to feel sorry for are the troops over there that are getting, you know, flying. Exactly. And how come this war on terrorism? How come al Qaeda is stronger than ever? And we still haven't got Osama and he's still making up a video in audio concerts and threatening to do this and do that. You know, something, one of these days, they will do something else. And in fact, they've been doing it all over the world. They've been doing all these things. And it's just a matter of time before they do it on US soil again. Well, I agree with that. The four is, you know, I think then it was the fact that we're over there now. Exactly what's the job of saying, what is that? Like he's hiding out now, taking pot shots. Because this is the, no, it is what he wanted is what Osama wanted. That's exactly what he wanted. In fact, there, there, there, there, there, there, there. After we went into Iraq, the anti war people were taken out as an a paper, where the picture was Osama saying, thank you very much, Mr. Bush, we're doing exactly what I wanted you to do. Yeah, absolutely. Look at that. And I know that we, you all, all these militant terrorist groups into Iraq who weren't there before this war before the attack. And we've made it a hotbed for terrorism, was it wasn't before? What are concept? But you don't even think, though, that even if there's a higher up in the Bush administration, how does it do over again, if they would not do it, if they knew it would be outcome was going to be? Not if they knew they were going to get caught with their, just like Tony Blair with their pants down. And it's heavy to do, you man. So that's terrible. Amen. Hi. Hang in there. There's a guy who, you know, could have been serveative moderate hint of vote for Bush. You're going to even have to ask him. No chance. No way, Jose. We got over a year. We have over a year for the public to wake up to see how they've been just snuckered. And yet, in spite of that, like I said yesterday, 69% of the latest bull, 69% of the American people, the Dodo birds out there think that Iraq and Saddam Hussein at something to do with 9.11. Did they? Absolutely nothing. Zero. 15 to 19 damn hijackers were Saudi Arabians. There wasn't one Iraq in the bunch. They hated each other, but now they're buddies. Now all of a sudden they have a common cause. 27 past 11 at 5.60 WC, we're going to change the world on a show. No, but at least I'm not going to get out of my system. Okay, I'm going to directly.

He's the best. 133 at 5.62 WC influences somebody sends this fact as a cartoon, he here's a priest for the world conference of clergy speaking. They're sniggering, yeah. He says this morning we'll discuss the very serious issue of child molestation. How can we keep doing it and not get caught? This is obviously from Hustler. Absolutely correct. Alright, nice gone, Pops. How can they keep doing it and not get caught in very easy? Because they'll put out a big dog and pony show like they didn't Dallas a few months ago. Was that last summer, right? Right? Time flies when you have in fun with little boys. And they'll put on a dog and pony show it all. Well this has to be stopped and they have a resolution saying this. Of course the Pope made one. He's more concerned about stopping those game marriages here in Canada and Europe all these things, you know, really the world. That's right. That's the kind of stuff he's worried about. Because then he's afraid to think about that. The Swiss guard will find the old fall and love and they'll all abandon them. The Swiss guard, you know. Always real hot looking young guys to have to meet certain standards. Have a certain penis like, even if they even measure their foreskin I understand. That's why they call the Swiss guard. Anyway, here's the fact that it's as I'm astonished by this because I've had no complaints about our internet connection. See, the whole thing with our streaming on the internet, I don't even know how it works. Are we still still cutting out the spots, right? We don't know. I don't know. It's something's happening. Well that's great. I think they hear this very much. I mean, I counted how they attended and viewed and checked out website. We ought to have a little more input and output. I mean, Eric's doing a phenomenal job. He got a great idea. James C. Morse story on airfactor and you can say douchebag. Well remember, you can say beiner boy or revive him. The internet, you think we ought to have a beiner boy revival? Are we already dead? Yeah. Anyway, go ahead. You were saying the internet screen is not Eric's doing. No, I'm not talking about Eric. I understand that. I'm saying he's going to great job on his end. It's in the building, there I know that. And nothing. So they're the ones that feed whatever it is that's happening. So it's probably Bob or Moth and George Corsot teaming up to make it a piece of crap, which is typical QAIM style. It's probably highlights of old Cames games. No, but seriously, in other words, the brace, anybody who's listening on the internet piece of stuff actually are called or do something. Okay, so we have some ID, what's going on there? Well, Eric, listen to the editor. Yeah, well, so what happens when we go to the commercial brace? For example, when I do a live spot, how does it does it automatically cut out? What's the, huh? They hear this. Yeah, that's not bad. It's an improvement over Moth. Absolutely. It says the internet connection. Your show has been terrible for a week. It keeps cutting out every two or three minutes regardless of the meaning of the thank you for introducing me to balance for life. I quit smoking tobacco this February game 20 pounds. I've been on the balance for life for Moth already lost 10 pounds. I'm paying good money and it's worth it. I can't believe that losers like the beast that fat little tub of crap was busy suck and Clarence's ass. What a rustic and suck. Refuse to take advantage of balance for life for free. Says the money I'm saving from not buying soda and fast food and candy is also better from the program. Are we newing for the next month? I'm going to look so good. I'll be doing all sorts of hot people by Christmas. Unlike the beast, excellent facts. Can keep it up baby. Keep doing it. Like that little fat pig just sticking over the hidden clearance. Okay. 20 years from now, they'll be lock and walk and hand and hand on the beach with a tin cup. Tragedy pathetic. He's off. I'm going to tell him, don't let me forget when Troy's dad comes in tomorrow morning. This is he's blown his last chance his last opportunity. Okay. Now it's an embarrassment. It's a great sponsor. A lot of people have done well with it. The food is good and he's getting it for free. This is a little spoiled little rich kid with his rich parents who have spoiled him. I made him into a fat little whatever. And I'm wobbling whatever he is. He's a monk. And he doesn't care. He doesn't want to do it. You don't want to remind me of what? It's like a fat beaner boy. It's the same thing. How many times can somebody lead you down the garden pad? I'm turning man. And you finally don't you just say hey, how would it get lost? I'm not sure if he's going to do it for somebody else. I like to find somebody else in a building. I'm not fat boy because he's a lost cause. I'll research it because as soon as I say that, remember last time, soon as I say we're cutting the beast off of the free food, there's fat boy. Hey, pali, I'll take it. Yeah, of course the only problem that is he eats an addition to what he usually eats. Hi, pali. She doesn't have to help to post the work. He eats the five, the three meals and the two snacks in addition to what he usually eats fat boy. We call it the snack sack. Yeah, I got to sack somebody to snack on and not him. They're even getting near me. OK, don't get close. Here's a call from the Redlands, hello. Why? Yes, sir. How are you, sir? OK. I call to inquire about your ret problem. Last Friday when you were talking about I couldn't get through. Yeah. And I have to deal with the rets living on a farm twice a year. You have plenty of time and when it starts to turn cold. Yeah. And whether's one, there's many more. Right. Well, they caught eight and then they came back over to the weekend. They did the ceiling up the thing and they checked up there again and there were no more. So they're going to come back there. I mean, they reproduce like every month. Like like rats. There are 28 days of something like that. And it's scary. And then once we have that here, they go no way rats. They're like eight inches long. Jeez. And then it's not including the tail. So we all have. I've been effectively being able to control them. It was dry bait. And I was peanut butter for crying out loud. That's food. They just dry bait and they go search for water. And so yeah, somebody called in the other day about the blue block thing that you put up there, which I guess is what you're talking about. You divide different different configurations. You can tell that your blocks are. Right. Whatever. And the warframe was off the market for several years now. It's back. And that's the most effective point to use. Warframe. Isn't that a blood center? Yes. Happens is the organs of the animals. This collapsed. Oh, right. Excellent. And they put their literally put their guts up when they die. But you don't want them doing that up in the attic. No, no, they go outside for water. Why? They go outside search and put water on a pit there. That's how literally. And like there's all their spleen all around like all of it. Yeah. And they did a little bit of a horrible death. It's a horrible death. Good. That's what we want for the rice is a horrible death. And you don't want to put food in the damn attic. No, because it's like a lord. It's like a life. What happened to it? And here I was making the house and I kept the sprains down. And the blackware's a crackle's got in there. And I put the sprains back up and the crackles ate through the sprains. So I had to control that. I had about three nuts up there. I had to go get out. It was horrible life is a bitch. You know, especially after you moved out the door. You mentioned Boofotose the other day. That's a gun shot. That's a gun shot. That's a gun shot. That's a gun shot. I mean, if you live out on the end of country, you can do that. But when you live in a house, you can't even, there'd be gun. You can't be so serious. Yeah, you can't be. You can't be. But I'll tell you one thing. I damn your loss. I'm a little vlog about two or three times though with those Boofotose bad news. Well, good luck. Good luck to us. Thanks a lot. There's a guy who's got his a rat problem out of control. He's using war for a man. He's fighting warfare against the rats. So that's against the rats. And of course, there's all different kinds of rats. We got the right wing rants. We got the religious fanatic rats, certainly most of the same. And then we got the crawling oozing, sneaking rats. Oh, it's like we got him under control for the moment. We'll see you with crispy critters. And tell your friends at ATM to calm down a little bit. Okay? And I've been calling a house and giving John a song in advance. Well, we feel we're so hurt. I, we love ATM. How many free plugs have we given him like every week? About 30 minutes. Because we appreciate Stephen ATM people live the best. They're great. Okay? But he didn't know. I left the car. You misunderstood. And so we called the crispy critters people, you know? And they do.

She right there is what's wrong with America's destiny's child. That's what's wrong with America. What kind of thing? Yeah. Eric has emailed me. I bet to this is about our internet here. It's not expected. It says your lines sponsor broadcast over the internet whenever something is played from the audio vault and goes to a recorded loop that periodically says something like, you are listening online to sports radio 560WQM where we turn to popular to a regular programming in a moment. All this is controlled by a WQAM. Well, how does that happen? Like, oh, I see. As soon as she's dropped the audio vault, it's like automatic. He's going to be automatic. Pilot. Yeah. He's going to be nice like Eric says I don't have anything to do with a live show stream. I only be recording our kind of live show stream. The streaming is fine. It's really down. The problem is probably with a list of connections. Regardless, thank you, Eric. Eric is the best. And here you were ripping them in as all those years. And he deserved it. But we got him out. Yeah, we got him off his dead ass. And he's in now that he's actually doing something. He's great. And you can't be convinced that that legal alien smuggled you smuggled in here like, uh, get the drugs for you. Yeah, make a list that we needed him for this internet thing. And he used to like, dittle around all morning long. Never get the damn stories on here until the day was like two thirds over anyway. Yep. Not to mention all the other problems we had, all the other minor problems. So there we go. So you see, Eric has redeemed himself and then some. Never too late. And I suppose to some people who had too many chances like Robert creeper and a beast. Let's make a package, dude. Let's win and doubts. Kick him and hell out. That's what that station needs a little bit of a house cleaning. And let me also ask you this, how many people deserve to be choir to produce a morning show. Bob, good man. And we first came to QAmen who were astonished at the, the entourage that they had for the worst team. Remember that? It was a, I mean, our show, it was you and me. That's it. There wasn't anybody else lifting a finger to do a goddamn thing for us. It was you and me against the world. And here's the morning show with our mediocre ratings. And they got like 75 people in there. The humber comes on and I got like 20 guys running around just to carry hands food around there. That's right. We're going to kind of carry out and carry out and carry as a cell phones. What is bookie calls. But for us, it's, you know, and then we finally get a third person in there. First we got to got to carry out on a, on a stretcher. And now you got to guys sitting there who can't get paid. And I just know I'm positive that because of my urging, that Clarence has got to have been in there by now. Would the paperwork for Scott to fill out am I right? No. No. Christ. What a bunch of derelicts man. Who are you people kid now? How are you going to keep stonewalling Clarence? Stonewall, by the way, was in New York. It's where the Fags went nuts. Stonewall. He probably knows about it. You don't want to know. You let you know. You think you think you know something? You are the most coolest person when it comes to sex. You're a, you have, you have no clue. Your clue is not about factory now. You need to get around the world and say, get out of the world. Okay. What I would do right now is pull a bank ice through something. Get you some money and travel the world and see what it's really all about. You're so clueless. It's sad. It's sad because you know, you're a horny little back through a ticket any at home. But, you know, it's sad. Okay. If only Annemoree would come back from LA. Here's what I'm saying. Well, if only Shannon would come back. Well, I don't think it missed pass up there that opportunity this time. It's not that you necessarily did last time, but we'll never know. Cause George is wife listens to the show. And they got enough problems already. Like that little kid that he didn't want. Here's the fact that says, am I contributing more to the problem? Huh? What? Oh. Just try to help you out. How come these phones are so weak now? We went through that little flurry like people pretending they had something to say. And as we got a couple of calls on here, I don't care. I'm so used to it, man. It's the same old, tired, so. South Florida, the cesspool of the universe. You can smell it. All crack open my window here. The, when the wind is blowing in a right direction upstream, I can smell it aroma. The cesspool that is South Florida. Here's the fact that says on the internet doing your show we hear your live spot. A quick Q and the arages bumper comes on and then silence until rejoin jingling the comedy bit. Oh, just silence? Well, that's not good. The sounds of silence? Apparently. During the rest of the day, if you're out of Q and message comes out of break the commercial break silence, sometimes the sports interview is played, which can get really pondering to us if it's from a previous sports season. Like if it's Laurie Zaka and Jim Kik talk at a Rick weaver, it's a little bit dated. You know what I'm saying? If it's like Bob Greesien's that a brand greasy, it might be a little bit dated. By the way, Brian, how's that thumb coming along? Thanks, sweetheart. Poor brand greasy. He's falling down. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, tax 60 on the AT and T. I can't wait for Thursday morning. I'm going to get up early. Don't let me forget. So I can hear the J. Feeleer show with Mohour David at 645-7Aam on Thursday here to what that's going to be like. It's going to be a suckfest man. Absolutely. Get out the old prep-aite for that one. Wow. Get out some extra supplies of posatories for that deal. As Moe just sucks J. Feeleer's ass Thursday morning. Well, Jay, we know of what's in your fault to team the defense play crappy, Bob. I've got everybody throws a dud coil at the end of the game anyway. Here's the uphol that we got going 300 votes. What's your take on this Thursday's two anniversary of 9, 11? Nothing will happen. 175. What me worry 88. I'm staying close to home all day 14. I won't travel that day 12. Bad Schmidt will have only 11 people. Our concern that bad Schmidt will have an, you don't think the American public is complacent do you? Or just because it's been almost two years now. Just the first, grow test episode. And just because we're spending billions and billions and billions of dollars in a God damn effort to try to put the pieces back together again. And we had no business being there in the first place. Man, it's unbelievable. It's criminal like I said, the impeachment proceeding should be underway now. Forget about a couple of blow jobs. We're talking about blowing people up is what we're talking about. In peace of it right now. Okay, get the real elected president in there. Let's, let's go back a couple of years. He is boring as he is. I'd rather have boring than this. You know what I'm saying? Absolutely. I think you do dangerous. Here's moral geables. Hello. Why you so miserable? Uh, to an hour. Words.

We don't need any Jews We don't need any it's just we just need people. Okay cut the crap That's the only hope for the human race. Okay is given to this foolishness this insanity You know the guy was talking about the rats puke and they're guts out for meeting at the war for you know. Yeah You think that they're going to like rat heaven when they get done They puked their guts out all over the place lots of cheese and we want to talk and about here Aminic there's just too much riding here on a future to hold God damn planet. Okay, and of course We know there's no such thing as global warming This is why 12,000 people just croaked in France in 14 every in Holland because of the fact that there's 125 degrees in the shade when it's supposed to be about 75 You know those things There's a great piece by the way if you go to our bedtime stories today There's a great editor on the New York Times today about George W. Bush. That's something that everybody ought to be we required reading Not to be forced to read it And a public just sits back Like this keep a mock-up. I keep them stupid keep a mock-up. I keep them busy keep them scrambling Since Dick Nixon walked away, where you've seen the pictures when you got on that chopper Yet you got on the top step yet. He's like given that saloon, you know, and I was at farewell a lot of you sit up your ass Since that day We haven't had anybody in that oval or that or oral officer as anxious as this one And not just him because he's just a bubble head. He's just a front man like they usually are But this group of right wing lunatic extremists that surround him dangerous dangerous and out of control I think rum spell is like on a vertical and over the edge Yeah, his performance in Iraq over the weekend was enough to scare to crap out of everybody including the troops over there Said hey don't bring him near us. We don't want to hear him speak. We want to help. We want to go to hell home or try to be in lied to not only is the American public being lied to But the kids over there being lied to also in terms of how long they're supposed to be there All right, it's gonna be a piece of cake. We'll go in your dual little cleanup We'll turn it all over to the Iraqis. We'll let them run their own country. We'll have elections and all these all is crap. Who are you? Can't don't forget It's worth it. It's all worth it. Yeah, it's all worth it because we're fighting that war on terror against the evil doers The most irresponsible ministry and like the article at Robert the one that we put on a website by James Moore I mean Nixon you know, so we lied about water gaiting the dirty crystal with like, yeah, because he was so paranoid and secure and hated the media I mean he could have been beaten a government with his hands tied behind his back But nevertheless, so that's basically what that was all about which isn't the only horrendous thing he did But nevertheless compared to this guy. He was a prince small potatoes. He was small potatoes The transgressions he committed not to mention of course the white wingers tried to drum Clinton out of there because he interrupted He'd even are perraid he interrupted their agenda for eight years See Bush one would all the the coast of the same characters generally speaking with the wolf which pearl Taney connection and Rumsfeld all these other goyum and Jews They had their hands on the the keys to the kingdom and now all of a sudden Clinton came along and oh Turn it away from for eight years that that's why from the minute he got in there You notice every appointment he did every nomination a shutdown And then of course we had the monica business Which we wasted sixty seventy million dollars in taxpayer money and of course Kenny Kenny star With his bullcraft there where we're writing a pornographic crap to the public on the internet about blow jobs and And the public says well a segment anyway sin. Oh, yeah, you're right This is immoral we can't have this and so now we have this kind of a gentler conservative compassion fascism We have a bunch of Nazis running your country is what we got We got our freaking movie actor. Not even a good one runner for governor of the biggest state in the country And he just might win a guy damn thing Arnold Schwarzenegger a Sick twisted right wing piece of turt who's he literally been in the country for how many years? Speak language All right, like ways as kind of for you. I do like that. I get I get I get all excited when he says got a form Don't you get emotional when he says that Anyway, but he released the second anniversary of nine eleven next Thursday Since nobody seems to be too concerned about nine eleven next Thursday is another arbitron trend and arbitrant just some ratings for junge Alien August which there will be two months two full months of for well and there but I think Right, see that's right there will be like two and a half months right too much of the reschedule us being back on him a day in for LB and on eight to ten and You know all of these things Although August is it just a horrible month you can see it on our website. There's nobody there And generally speaking for whatever reason our crowd is the one they're the people at leave town You only part of our crowd that stays in town of the miss fits the ones that we hear from her But the them all yeah, either the whisperer in a background. That's just a quarter and oh, they're not going anywhere They've got two nickels to rub together They can't even do like a grasshopper the game rub their legs together. I wish I had two nickels. Yeah, that's right I can't believe the clearance has been in there yet. You know something. I'm gonna go on strike. I'm serious. I'm taking off a few days Unless Clarence Darrell aka Josh whatever hell his name is from bum fork unless he comes in here Adam soon and Give this great now see here's what a scan that the beast leaves pull The previous guy we had the beater boy there he was on the payroll He was getting paid gunnel he knows where that money was going but we got a pretty good idea, but he was getting paid So it's not like we're adding somebody new on there like I said the other shows Zillions and Zillions of people that produce a show how many people and not only that like at the first team Back when it was Joe and Defoe and Gildy you have three guys doing a show and about 15 people producing it My god So we got two people and we got like one board up there one flunky. I mean one the guy flunky Take a pain button monkey. So other is what they're trying to do is like save the diff you the minimal Scrapings there I mean it's too embarrassing even talk about the amount of my talk about by not putting Scott on a payroll and not paying him Clarence you can suck my fat old pimple ass. Okay get your act together and get with it Why is it that this show always get short change though? They can't spread enough money on a morning show is they got a guy in there from five a.a. to clock in a morning couldn't get a number if His life depended on if you suck a guy then oozy up his pimple old ass. I could get one their answer is They're into his one why you know why we get short changed quote. Why is that all because we know we pay Neil all this money We've built in studios everywhere. This is what we do for the Neil riders show I see and the fact that I'm making the millions and millions of dollars in Propensive that they can do their fun and games on all the sports crack and make great Right that's right don't respond with anything it makes too much sense because the beastly's can't respond to that Because you know damn well, I'm not still on here on this radio station because of the fact that they like my looks Or they like the way I talk about them or they like me in any way shape or form they even like the way that I smell even by long business They don't want any part of that They want those big numbers they want the big revenue not just that comes in on this show But that comes in on the show surrounding it as a result of the just by association You know I'm talking about sure the Sponsors that don't want to be on the show because it's offensive and disgusting But they sure want to be on the station because we got every guy there mammal in town. Listen to you QAM and so as a result They're like you know auxiliary to this show And all we ask is just take care of our people that's all and they can't do it and muff is in it Oh gee, I don't know I'll talk to clear it's I don't know muff is in a new changing his bra and panties God nice nice outfit by the way. Smoring George was a scrub and vuff's outfit in detail Yeah, but poke it out bra and silk panties, but why green? Well, maybe he's getting ready for Saint panties. It's a way off. I never start too soon Or maybe he's just green with envy now that Clarence is the PD and he has no authority over him You do know that don't you yeah, you know that he's not too happy about it I know that to he was crying and wailing and just carrying on a few months ago I just I thought he was gonna have an ever-spray that I How they made this little punk kid who can't get laid in a horror house They made him to PD and how they they give him a title operations manager. He's he's like a man without a kingdom You're all saying yeah, no, he's like Robert Duval and I work Remember that scene? After Howard B. when I'm screaming about to deal with CCA the Saudis and then ironic that there was the Saudis no less Oh man, panty Chiosky for president even though he's dead Wow, I think Michael Moore is a reincarnation of panty Chiosky What a brilliant guy so far ahead of his time Given their in fact panty Chiosky was even under shpilky's nirabi for she was born 12 minutes passed no and if I didn't anybody understand what I'm talking about Oh, no, that's your idea. I like that. No, seriously, it's better to you know these calls. Oh See I had the right idea last year. I just had the wrong way of going about it, you know After right idea because phone calls on and they suck Especially when half of the town isn't there. What do we have to draw from you know I mean this show should have been syndicated a long time ago But you got Norma can't who's worried about being a baseball maven who's worried about oh Greg will pay me don't call me anymore, do norm fight your own battles done. You're okay Everything with me is just fine my texture up on time. It's all I care about. I'm having a life a rally I love it You can't get paid by Greg read so is that okay?

You would tell me about this before to show today Here's the story from the Washington Post In the most aggressive and some say invasive step yet to protect air travelers the federal government and the airlines will face in a computer system next year To measure the risk posed by every passenger on every flight in the US away A except it on CNN they said flyers will be sorted according to color Right that's with a little right the little caption and if the darker you are the deeper in the back of the plane you've ever said And if you're real real dark your way back in cargo separate plane The new transportation security administration system seeks to probe deeper into each passenger's spectrum identity Then is currently possible comparing personal information against criminal records and intelligence information Passengers will be assigned a color code green yellow or red. Oh, but I tell you one thing if you're colorblind in American out your and deep crap Based in part on their city of the paracher destination traveling companions in date of ticket purchase Based on their city of the paracher destination Traveling companions and date of ticket purchase notice it says based in part. They're not telling you the other part Most people be coded green and sail through but up to 8% of past news aboard nations 26,000 daily fights will be coded yellow I guess if they're Chinese and will undergo additional screening at the checkpoint according to people familiar with the program And estimated one or two percent will be labeled red Those who are flying to Cuba from Canada And will be prohibited from boarding. I'm going prohibited from boarding. Yeah, these passengers will also face police questioning and maybe are rested If we don't like the way they look The system will provide protections for the flying public said TSA spokesman Brian turmoil or is that turmoil?

We should keep them from sitting next to wanted Accumator is to we said Well, let me ask you a question The new system called computer assistant passenger prespeading system to caps two Which I think is kind like that pee We're talking about on Monday Has parts so much controversy among both liberal and conservative groups that the TSA is struggling in it going Delta airlines backed out of a testing program at the agency earlier this year and now the TSA will never feel which airlines will participate When it test a prototype early next year If all goes as planned the TSA will begin the new computer screening of some pastures as early as that somewhere Eventually be used for all domestic travelers This system is going to be replete with errors that very stun hard director Vacere news technology liberty program You can be falsely arrested you could be delayed you could lose your ability to travel Got yati ony in a part-age in a territory so it just goes on and on and on like I said you better not be colorblind Otherwise crawl out of the bed and they'll come up because between the color coding of the passengers and a color coding on the alerts and then we got the The is it what is it the orange alert for the missing children of amber amber alert? I'm sorry and we got so many goddamn colors in the course who knows what's going on?

Very old type of just, you know, they're just pulling everything out just the most base humor. They can possibly go for it. Anything you'd expect from Woodby Goldberg. Nothing. I even tried to shoot fire. Why have I ever a suggestion for it? Don't watch it. I don't watch Woodby Goldberg. She makes me just looking at her makes me sick of my stomach. I can't even stand looking at the bitch. But why would somebody call me to belly ache about Woodby Goldberg? What's the point? Don't watch it. No. Would you watch it?

Like when you're on a hold, you know? Right? When you have that bitch with all little, you notice anywhere you go in the world that's in Bitch's voices on there when you're on a... She's on a...

No, that's why you're talking this way, now, you know. No, no. But anyway, if they don't do the school, but they have it to all day school. Right. And what's not a bullet, and everybody knows that story. So everybody, down on the problem with the way you get into his stericolabuddy, you sound like you're ready for a stroke. Okay. The problem I have is, if you go to the intern, okay, when over to the school and the people that were there, they were protesting, and then people they bought their kids. They believe they're completely... So the intern was in the union, and they're speaking of evil people, they're called baggage evil. So this unbelievable, the eight and came real, it just goes to show you how a parent, just so ignorant that he brainwashed or kids. Well, let me ask you something, what do you think kids learn hate from? Where do you think they learn it from? They learn it at home. Exactly. And then it upset me, I always like kids like that. I have gay friends, we learn not. Me too. I was brought up in Miami, and I'm a people person. You know what I mean? You know, it's just, it's just, it's, it's just, it's just, it's, it's just, it's, it's just, it's, this tells me that people still go by the book. It's, 30,000 years old.

That's the one. The Korean, the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Great Testament, the Book of Mormon. Sure? Whatever it is. Pick a book. Pick a line. Pick a phrase. Pick your nose. It's all the same book. Like I told you before. Religion must be eradicated before it's too late, before we blow up the goddamn world. And this president's got us well in a way to do it, by the way. Well, all these evil doers. There's a lot of evil doers. You only problem is he and his cohorts ought to be looking in the mirror every time they say evil doers. I think we may be there drinking a little bit too much evil doers myself. How's Brian greasy to all that away? I'll call that again, Brian. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon.

Okay. Doonsbury says that if you were yanked a little bit too much. No, see? And we had that, sir. I'm sorry. And it said if you masturbate a lot between like 20 and 30 years of 20 and 35, between those ages, that like, keeps your ducts clean. So you don't have to go on by a whole bunch of duct tape.

Southern California couple of face charges in videotape the child molestation victims as youngest three possibly rated it. Rancho Santa Margarita California couple of allegedly videotape and photographed themselves molesting girls as youngest three have been charged with numerous felony accounts and connection with the assaults. What do we do with a bunch of scumbags where molesting were a little kids like right and if you have bad aim well so be it. David Shaohi Huang H.H.W.A. N.J. Huang 32 and his wife Sheila Sheila careful cat. What he's one sick cat 23 were arrested the last Wednesday if investigators searched their home on anonymous tip. Police on more than 100 video tapes and pictures of three to nine year old children being molested police police police police about the tapes is made go back as far as 10 years were filmed in the later Texas where Huang lived before moving four years ago to Rancho Santa Margarita California. A case like this will sicken even the most seasoned investigator Orange County Sheriff spokesman Jim Alarmino said Monday. Sick cat was released from custody over the weekend in lieu of $150,000 bail playing remains in jail without bail. The two were charged Friday with two counts each of using a minor for sex acts playing with charged with 21 counts of loot acts upon a child sick cat faces four counts of that charge according to court records. A Monday children soul lemonade and rate scooters and bicycles up and down the block of large Spanish colonial style homes where the couple lived while adults express their shock. Their shock. Shock and awe. Here's an interesting thing speaking of our shocks off that. I'll fill out a fat around in the dikes. I think that. Oh yeah, yeah, I noticed that. Lesbians stick around the middle of US study. Janet Reno's not fat. How do you know? She wears those really baggy dresses. Well, are you saying that she's a die? Is that what you're saying? No, no, what were you saying? She drives a truck. Oh. Are you saying she's a girl? No, no, I would never say that. A lady. Wow. Sure. Lesbians are fatten and have thicker waistlines than their heterosexual sisters. The coin A. You go a sister. According to a US study, leaving the scientists lost to explain the findings. They were lost. Although Lesbians eat smoke and exercise about the same as their sisters, the study found it. What does it keep saying that? This is in the National Post here this morning. The study found it carries significantly more abdominal fat. This puts them in increased risk of heart disease and diabetes. One explanation might be there's a genetic difference between Lesbians and their heterosexual sisters. There's that word against the lead researcher. Stephanie Roberts, a San Francisco doctor. Doctor Roberts, so the reason could be hormonal linked to the reproductive issues, or to higher levels of cortisol, a fattening stress hormone that's often elevated members. Cortisol is not one of the things that they petalone those phony informersials. I know. Yeah. You haven't seen that one with a real pasty set where it looks like they're sitting in front of a fake plant. I don't see any of them. Oh, you don't watch informersials. See that's where Biner Boy had you beat by a man. He liked the informersials. Especially the ones where they petal drugs. It could also be a cultural difference you said. In the lesbian culture, there's been long history of fat acceptance. That's what Shirley Queer is used to say. Remember that? No. Gipsy, Rosalie, whatever her name was. What was her name? That's phony name she used. She had a funny timeline with what's your name? She was fat 2 a matter of fact, from Power 96. Ms. Cleo, low-gritton. No, and Poe Griffin. She was fat and a whale of a personality. Yeah, in the lesbian culture there's been long history of fat acceptance, size acceptance, and body acceptance in general, and dieting has been perceived as something that's not a setting of your body. Studies have consistently shown that lesbians have a higher body mass index than heterosexual women in US national average. But until now is unclear whether lesbians were more muscular. More muscular had more fat tissue. I would like Charlie on passions. See that she's not fat. She didn't even have a bag of sugar around her poop. Oh, not the job. I beg your pardon? Nothing. You know, watch the show. You don't understand it. Okay, you just didn't. We're like Beth, she's got a bag of sugar if she's pretending to be pregnant. Dr. Robertson and team of academies from the School of Nursing at the University of California, San Francisco surveyed 324 lesbians and 324 of their heterosexual sisters closest to them in age. Oh, see, I guess this really means sisters literally. See, okay, I think. Don't you think? No, I think they're just generic. Yeah, like cousins. They can go girl. Each woman was asked to measure herself and wear herself. Lesbians had a significantly higher body mass index, waist circumference, and waist to have ratio than their sisters, she said, this suggests that if it's in BMI is fat, not muscle tissue. So if you think that dikes are more muscular, forget about it. The survey published today in the journal of Women's Health Issues found the lesbians were slightly better educated and 8-less red meat and more fish. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. I'm not making that out alone. I am not making that up. Okay, well, the way I'm done. Wow, I have just tasted your snap. Get out of here and write you sickle pervert. But these did not appear to be important factors. It's the fact that they're eating more fish. Oh, God. Thanks for ever to get that taste and smell. How do you sustain that? No, not really. I don't want to hear about it. 5-6, especially it's so close to my lunch. 5-6, 705, 60 pound, 5-6, the only AP and T line. What's your take on this Thursday, 2 year anniversary of 9-11, ask them, they, 441 votes. Nobody's buying duct tape in this queen. Erick got it on there, but nobody's buying it. Bad Schmidt will happen only 15. I won't travel that day only 15. I'm stay close to them all day 19. What me worry 133, nothing will happen 259. All right. I say based on this audience's various soup observations, that it's going to be a coast is clear. Be afraid. Be very afraid. So it's a key. Either be afraid and panic and get all bad out of shape or just go about your business. That's what I say. Just go about your business. I got a great article here from CNN about which flat screen TV is best. Remember that? I mentioned last week. Right. And nobody, we had like 2 responses. It's good. It's bad. Yeah. And then your house on fire. See, I want to have discovered over the years generally. Once in a great while, there's an exception, but generally speaking, if you can't on the audience for any advice about anything, like killing rats or any disease. On the other way of speaking, disease, the, you know, the heel spare I've had on my right heel for like ages now for months. Seems to be like going away. Huh. Just like when I had that, what do they call that? That plantar fascist fascist fascist? On the bottom of the same heel, about a few years ago, and it, oh, man, hurt like hell. And if you don't do anything, it goes away. If you do all kinds of other crap, but you just waste a lot of money and a lot of time you get aggravated and doesn't do a goddamn thing. I just mentioned that in passing. Here's Volk, a hello. Hey, doing you. Pretty good. All right. I've got a couple things in the media right now to, uh, I'll see you about. Yes, sir. Okay. We have, uh, I called it down Mariah Care being one of the, uh, that's a lot of, uh, the, uh, that's a lot of stuff going with people and celebrities out there. Right. And I just want to say she's coming out with a double CD now. All her songs remakes. Uh, That's that it. And, um, you know, instead of like, you know, she should just enter creating it by just doing that one play or shooting and ending it. Right. Right. That's a give it over money. You know, right. Okay. Oh, she's got a real ego problem. She's, but she's been, uh, turned down and, uh, you're a crap down by so many people I can't stand her, including Luis Miguel. She just can't handle it no more. She really thinks she's a big star. Hey, it's unbelievable. Just do your one 10 house play boy shot and take money and, uh, don't ever let us see you again. And that's the lottery or something, you know? Right. Let's get it and get Richard out of it. On we have a, uh, Marie Corrette, your Ohio State superstar running back to, uh, the strategy for school is going to jail now. He's never going to play for Ohio State again. We're going to have a whole program. And, uh, I say great because you know what? Now my, and he's going to, when another national championship. Well, that's very important stuff because if my, we went to another national championship, then we can all feel a lot better about ourselves. Can't wait. Don't you, you, you're, if the hurt cool is what another national championship, I'll tell you what in the way to hit a struggle to come from behind against that rotten gear to meet the other damn. That's so sure about that. Of course, they are playing another girl school this week in East Carolina. East Carolina, uh, a girl school for the blind. So that should probably be like, you know, walk over. Just like the dolphin game against, uh, Houston. Just like that dolphin game against Houston. He said, oh, they count it. Didn't I just dream that lately I've been having experiences and I feel like I just, I just dream these things. They couldn't possibly really happen. You know what? Right. I mean, dolphins losing a home opener at home, no less to the Houston text. Hey, problem. Stench of palminoor covers over this performance by the dolphin. Absolutely correct. Wow. That's why I, uh, everybody's so down in town, you know? People are down in town. Law, let's do this for a go here. This is one of my favorite stories. Pizza, like, that's so much stuff here. And I've been taking a lot of calls. Germany complains to Italy about Hitler wines. That's that is shock. He's in the wine. Do my mention, my name is the vice-macher Gary. Well, I, you know, that Moosolini. I don't think he ever really left. He's still hanging around. It's a trouble. It's after one. What was his, uh, uh, uh, well, she wasn't his wife. What was her name for his, uh, Mrs. Moosolini. His squeeze. I don't know. I don't know what her name was, but they hung the both of them. And side by each right there in the middle of Rome. I was a dude. Maybe it wasn't in Rome. I don't know where it was. Where did they hang Moosolini? I thought it was in Rome. Are you sure? Yes, I am. Are you really? Yeah. Oh, so in other words, we actually got somebody to know something. And they're not in this scary. They hung Moosolini in Rome. And they were scotted to tell us, and he didn't even get paid for it. No, I just, I can't, no, no, no, you're laughing. It's not funny. It's pathetic. Well, guess what? I'll be doing on 9.11. Panhandling. Right. I wouldn't, wouldn't surprise me. Yeah, be real good day to be out there in the streets with your hand extended. I'm, well, the nice dough in you. I've got a ride you can wear on your head. Do you know that in Toronto here? We've got people that have like franchises for different street corners and locations. Okay. I really believe that. I think they bought a franchise somewhere because I've seen some of these people for years. It's just amazing to me. It goes in the same spot. And they always look like we old a shovel to everything. Then they get in their god. They mercury are their mark key. And they drive away. Show for a drink. First, you pull your beds down around your knees. Roll back from your desk and spread them on your feet. Burn, we wrap your hands on the ground. You want to be dead and pull up and down. Pull up and down and jerk that knees. Keep the keyboard covers over and won't splash. And they're pumped and the tube right bit up. You're lap how you could be just like the cheese. And a pole-blast security. Oh, right. And down, burn, we do secure airports. All the borders and the shinthing ports of pause. Before you get around to win, pull down your shores. And pull them around, pull them around and jerk the board. And get yourself a nice set of blow-pens. As the time doodling, if you're a desk down, you're in charge. Just like the cheese. And a pole-blast security. Oh, your beds down and feet your feet. On 17th at 560 WQM, here's a lady in somewhere in Hollywood, hello. Hi, how are you doing? Pretty good how you be. I'm just fine thanks. I know you think you don't have a lot of female listeners, but you do. You have so many. But you can do it a man. Yeah, that's a baby. We don't have the time to call. I'm just kind of telling you I'm going to the protest. It's after the middle of the evening. And for a lot of deal. And as far as you pull, nine or eleven really doesn't have a lot of bearing on me anymore. Because the terrorists know that the government likes our government, like to keep us on fear. So they did all they needed to do. All they have to do now is make threats. They don't even have to make good on them. Because we're just going to constantly keep the people on fear in order to keep control over them. So I don't think there's going to be any. I'm working too well lately though. Not if you look at us, pull members. It's not working the, you know. Yeah, I'm dropping. The thrill is gone. I hope it's keep tongue is dropped on my fear. But I hope it's time. All right, thanks. Two good jobs, Sam. I mean, I don't want to prevent anybody from going to that thing. You know, they're doing their civic duty and they're expressing their view point. Of course, that in 40 cents will buy about a third of a cup of coffee. You know what I'm saying? 40 cents. What's that? Like I said about the five bucks will buy a third of a cup of coffee. All of that reiterates pitch in threatens lawsuit. On the eve of the Broward County's first budget hearing, election supervisor Miriam elephant renewed her plea for a partnership with the county. But threatened to lawsuit at the same time. How do you like that? Sure. Might be that traffic lady. We used to have a passion. Elephant called the news conference yesterday to reiterate her budget request and she's taking her case to the community, including the Broward Legislative delegation to League of Cities, political candidates and groups of need be the Governor-Minders Secretary of State. If all that fails in elephant doesn't get the money and helps she's looking for when the county finalizes its $2.5 billion budget September 23rd, Elephant said she'll take her case to court. The appeals process for election supervisor who feels she's inadequately funded. But elephant has only 32,000 Trinity bucks in her budget for legal fees. Hearing up for the final matches between her office and the Broward County Commission, which begins its formal budget hearing today, they're probably doing it right now. Elephant met with county staff members yesterday, she went to Alico's whole thing. I think we have this on our website, yeah, it is. If you want to read the rest of it, it's too fond of us from here, can't stand that bitch. None of on these people who's going to like it, she might be a little bit of mow. Absolutely. She's going to continue threatening her way into her position. Let's see, here's a fact that says earlier, some of your colors are complaining about bush limbo and right wing of friction, sports they don't get it. I got my thing on it though, the reason I fell out of the significant things are getting so hooked up by these fascist is because they want the intelligent people of this great country to pay attention to more important things than the garbage they're doing outside of the Scoyati, Adiati, the American masses can't make up on Monday and go on with life and real issues after Dave wants that and J. Pete will lose a ballgame. I like sports, and go to some games, but life goes on, I'm not in line to jump off the due to the turtle because J. Pete loses an average quarterback and wants that she'd be coaching high school football. Every time I heard the hysteria with some of these idiots over analyzing Pheeler and her coons, the gators and all these things, I want to get that out of here. Is it too much to ask that you separate sports entertainment from real-life issues? Yeah, it's too much to ask and so forth. This is, I can just hear these kids asking their parents for help with their homework advice on issues their lives and dad screaming. Can't you see I'm speaking the more Howard David I need to tell him how upset I am with Pheeler. Sports and then yeah, that's the important stuff on QAM. We're on 9-11. We had like an extra hour of sports because the guilty was sitting there with his finger up his eyes. What are you going to talk about? We have nothing to say about it. And we're still talking sports because Duff was running around the halls. Oh, Greg, what do we do? What do we do? You know, Duff who can't decide which hand-to-way presents would. Good guy, but a real pansy, you know. Here's a story pulled cast support for California recalls stalled. Support for the recall of Governor Gray Davis has stalled a new policy just. While Lieutenant Governor Cruz Booster-Monte is open to slingly over Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger in California. The field pulls set for release today, well I guess it's released today, isn't it? Yeah. Well, I'm gay. As soon as I said Arnold, I guess they're gagging. Finally, 55% likely voter support to recall down from 58% in the August pool, but the difference remained within the pool's margin of error. 40% said they opposed to be called again a 3.5 months of last month. Meanwhile, I'm not to go boost the money in Schwarzenegger or buddy, but boost the money is not open a small leave. He's got a small opening. 30% to Arnold's 25%. Senator Tom McClentick, a state senator, the leading conservative in the racist strength in his third place, getting 13% again a 4.3 weeks, but I also within the margin of error. Former baseball commissioner in business man Peter Uberoff came in with 5% and columnist every unhappiness that got support from 3%. She's still huffing and puffing. We see support for recall fading, said Gabriel Sanchez, a spokesman for the Davis group. Schwarzenegger spokesman Todd Harris said the poll is younger than among candidates for replace Davis. It's a two-man race in Schwarzenegger's daily Republican with a chance to win Arnold. It's a lie. It's not a two-man. How do you like that? It's scary. It's frightening. It's one thing to have fun with it. If you last would it, but the idea that there's somebody can take it seriously is so phenomenal. It's a mind-boggering. Yeah. It's amazing. Well, what are all these facts? It's just pouring in here. I see. So, can you imagine a presidential election scenario where the only two candidates to pick from would be W and Jewelieberman? No. No, I can. And it won't happen. For the amount that I despise and load W, Jewelieber makes W's leadership skills look like Vince Lamberties. See you are going to put false stuff again. I'm a few of the facts. It's the same guy to the facts, yellow. What's the same guy to just pass the elbow to the same up print that's the same type? Scott is full of crap and based his authority and man are speaking needs to go on payless probation a bit longer. Okay, no problem. Here's the guy can stop. Okay. Okay. During the last days of the war in Italy, dictated of an eatomusally, Neat tempted to escape the advancing allied army by hiding in a German convo headed toward the Alps. Partisan stuff then searched to convoy a dongo. Her? Dongo is a convo, but more white folks. They found it in the back of a truck wearing a private's overcoat over his Strap General's pants. The partisans took him for his neighbor's later joined by his mistress, Tara Patachi. A few days later, both were executed near Mizegrah. Then on April 29, 1945, their bodies were hung at an SO gas station in the Pazzali Loretto in Milano, not in Rome in Milano, the Pazzali Loretto. Pazzali. Got it? Got it. Along with several other fashions leaders. So what was in Milano, not in Rome? There were been in Milano, Rome? Scott? No sir? I've been in Bolonio, but I think it's what you're full of today, but that's okay. No, what do you think I can pay? If you see the way he said it like he knew it is a fact, you know? Do you have any idea how far Rome is from Milano? Do you think they're close side by each? That's not a remember. He was there. That's not how he remembers it. Well, I can like always these paillus weeks one day. You'll say, I remember that. What do you want? He'll be a little part of it as one of those soldiers. What's your take on this Thursday's two year anniversary of man level raskin' today on theorodges.com? So far pretty blasé. 485 votes. We got four harbind duck in this queen right now.

I think you can make judgments all along, but I think those judgments will inevitably shift. So how will history view the Clinton presidency? I was counted to be one of the two three worst American presidents. I was a corrupt, drunk, and I think the public isn't top of no doubt. How much do you think we need to know about a president or a former president to story of his or her life? I was a fraud for the beginning. I think the legal activity you have got taxpayers money. But how do a lot? If people don't like it, will you deal with all of this in your memoirs? Oh sure. Oh, okay. Well, I'm busy on the internet. I don't care. I'm looking at that. But I will take this call online. I know. I'm very dubious. Here's Indianapolis. It says, hey, do a nail. Okay, sir. I don't think any of the evidence of timber. I love it. I mean, that would be a little foolish, I don't you think? What do you mean it would be a little foolish? Well, if it's going to happen on the timber, whatever, no cheating, that's something that will be expected. I don't know. I see we really don't know. It could happen on 11 to 12 to 13th and week from circus. We don't know. We never know. I heard Georgie other week complaining about some of the chronic. Yeah. What do we ever do to him? Oh, yeah. See, why do you believe these people? I told you about all the evidence, guys. I'm very important. He didn't. That's why wrote a like crap up there. Oh. Anyway, so I'm looking on the internet here and I'll see. The word in and is biggest mistake, Yadi. Oh, this is a long thing. When a German surrounded in Northern Italy in April 45, he's arrested again. He's Mr. Clareau Petace, he were moved from the jail at a Julino de Maceguro and Lynch by the local communist partisans. And it were hanged in Milano, like we said, okay. What do we have to rehash that? Oh, they always never rehash it. This is actually believe what you wrote on there. She's got. I'm finding out as an idiot. I'm saying, oh, he really isn't idiot. That is making the bad guys just a moron. I could have told you that. Okay. Well, I didn't realize that. I thought that maybe you like knew something or had something to offer. So I think generally what we're going to do is like on the days that he's doing, we'll just take the microphone out. Because, you know, even if only by accident, he might say something. We don't want that to happen. Now, when a bad line made before, I noticed there was a lengthy conversation with that. Was that carrots to tell you about to sign the papers to get paid? No. It wasn't. It was normal. Wanting what? Picture the you? Tell that. Tell that bag to leave me alone. Okay. Tell them, don't call that radio station ever again. I'm not giving it a no picture. I'm not doing no Bobblehead does. I don't want to be bothered by him. Okay. First, I took care of the rumors, which is great. And I'm taking here a him. Leave me alone. God. Bap. Bap. This man lives in such a fantasy line. It's just unbelievable with his fantasy baseball and his fantasy life and his fantasy a faggory. Just leave me alone, normal. Okay. Life is wonderful. Oh. It's like, you said it the other day. I mean, it's like somebody is stalking me. It's like, you know, if it's not remember, it's normal. The stalkers. I did like that show. Those talk stalkings a lot, but I guess you know that. Yeah. Man was he hot. But anyway, just saying no to abstinence, right? Zoey Williams in the Guardian today. He says, Athens. This is too long to read the whole thing. Let me know when it gets boring. Oh, now. Abstinence is a very American phenomenon. It's always making news over here, not in terms of shopping or food or anything else. The abstention from which might do the world any kind of favor. And we're talking about Estins from Sex specifically teenage sex, which is coincidentally the only perpetually renewable resource known to mankind. The onslaught on teenage sexuality is too full. There are the Evangel Evangelical Roachos that preach abstinence to the marriage. These are a full of Billy Graham style hysteria from excitable girls, but attendance is not mandatory. So even though they receive government grants, the constant of no violation of the constitutional, though not popular law against the including religious beliefs and public school system. Abstinence training in schools is subtly different. Because of that law, many of the programs that even mention marriage, they just say, wait. I once asked Andrew Donner, director of health and Rochester in New York, how long people were supposed to wait. He said, we don't specify, we just say, wait. I said, what? You just take the time you want to have sex. Add none specified about it. Time and then have sex? He said, you're a pain in the ass. You know that? Other, I'm reading it. I said, you're a pain in the ass. You know that? Other programs have a Judeo Christian overtone, but being unable to make any concrete statements, they concentrate instead on the rather nebulous idea that it's nice to be clean on one's wedding night, like Apologna. Painting virginity is a nice gift of bestow. This business predates bush by 20 years, but predictably enough, he's always been a doubty believer. In 1996, when he was governor of Texas, his state had the largest abstinence in nationwide, which he justified with the declaration, abstinence is not about saying, no, it's about saying, yes, to a healthier, healthier, happier future. Funding for just say no campaigns, now outstrips that per safe sex campaigns almost threefold. There are needless to say a lot of things wrong with this. First, many of the campaigns are absolutely scare-mongering, which puts them up, uh, puts the, uh, wind-up teens whenever we do have sex and makes them less likely to seek medical help for treatable conditions. Second, most of the dumb slogans like you if you don't aim to please don't aim to tease, puts the onusong girls to act as gatekeepers to sexual experience, which is massage-enistic. Third, the overwhelming emphasis on teenage pregnancy expressly excludes homosexuals from the debate and to help compromise by the right way of medical and student's sexual health in 2000. A young female doctor was asked how she'd apply the abstinence message to a young homosexual coming into her clinic. She said, I would tell him that he was sitting against my lord. Over here in Britain. Over here in Britain, things are very different. The latest literature on the matter is entitled Just Say No to Appstones campaigns. A substantial part of the budget in our routine sexual health is put toward educating and supporting teenage mothers so that their predicament need not necessarily create a cycle of poverty. This is treated as a class issue, rather than a moral one and rightly so-so in girls from poor backgrounds, are ten times more likely to become teenage mothers than girls from professional ones. This is the definitive comparison and debate about the role of religion in the political process. Evangelical opinions so often gets levels backs up on individualistic issues, homophobia, misogyny, so-called family values which castigate the very people, single parents, who are taking the greatest responsibility. In fact, where faith intersects with politics is almost always about class and poverty, this is why the religious writings just where the religious left doesn't, no one ever crusades for the very poor on a biblical ticket. Politicians draft in faith-fast opinion, faith-based opinion where they want to reframe an issue of underprivileges one of immorality. The social consequences of inequality can be then put down to the fact that some people are just born bad and also by malign coincidence born poor. We always take a great deal of interest in American and the shivers that are implicitly religious. We view them as an exotic quirk, like French presidents and their mistresses, or Austrians in their fascists. But there's nothing exotic about the way Evangelical Christianity and particular operates in American society, it's just a predictable function of right wing policy making. As Alistair Campbell memorably remarked, over here we don't do God, we don't do God at all. This must be the most valuable distinction still exxst in between us in America, that we have yet to fall back on bogus concepts of morality who explain why some teens sleep around in chocolate and some don't. Sorry if that sounds like prumphalism, but God knows we don't have much. Pretty good, I'd say, eh? Yeah, but I would rather hurt some calls. 560, 760, George wants to hear some of those good calls. Tom Bach, Tom 560, the only AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line. Manicone? Here's Hi Ali, that's always good for one, hello. Hello? Yes sir. How are you, New York? Well, I'll talk about September 11. It's funny how people still refers to a like, you know, your terrorism and all of this crap. Basically, you know, first of all, we got a look at who benefited from 911. And it seems to me it's very obvious who got the benefit from it. Yeah, who's that? Well, the government, US government, administration got the benefit from it because they got to go to war and all of these corporations make money because of it. So, so what are you trying to say to the government, was your responsible for 911? Well, definitely they have something to do with it. How do you know that? Well, they've definitely based on what? Well, there's a lot of inconsistencies like what happens to the black boxes of the planes. Yeah. Okay. They could never found those that said they were destroyed yet again. They found the leftovers of apparently a passport from one of the hijackers. We've received reported that on their website that some of the hijackers are actually alive somewhere. Yeah. It seems pretty odd that all of those things that we have in place, having the most advanced intelligence, having monitoring the island satellite. Well, what happens is we have the most advanced intelligence when George Tenad is the director of CI testifying just a few weeks ago, that there's no connection, there's no evidence whatsoever, any connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda. What happens is we have it, and then the public gets lied to what's the point? Well, I'm trying to explain it. I'm going with you, meaning that they're telling us all these lies when in reality their planes are very, very different. And all of the media, it's all geared to manufacture consent, so to make people believe that they lie to them. And all of this, we've been feeding, we've been fed by lie in four years. And then all of a sudden, this happened and the clear, the blame had to go towards them. And still they still haven't found them. So then we say, there's no word to be found. And we keep on now, now they're trying to gear themselves for another attack. And I wouldn't be surprised if before the election, 2004, surprised, there's another attack. And then we got to go to work to Iran and to defend this country. And supposedly these elections, which there were never elections in the last elections, this guy was placed there by his father's right. By the Supreme Court, yes. And what makes us think that now that they have computer voting, next time we go to the elected to the polls, it's just going to be a formality to make people believe they're going to vote. And we still have to do it because it's not going to be a good one. I think they probably already have to print out what the numbers are going to be in each state. You think that jab has got the four numbers? We probably got that. We had an article on a website a few days ago about that, about these computer-wise machines. And how there's so much easier to fix than the other ones? Yeah. Mom, I just mentioned that in passing. Not that there are any fixed elections in America. I just mentioned that for you. Never had been never will. No. Not in America, maybe land of the free and home of the naive 19 deal too. So what the hell was he trying to say? Why did you local? We were supposed to be in the 560's U.S. U.A.M. Or David's a bitch. Absolutely. Okay, so George Hill, thanks as we got a new bush-bed from Boca Bryant. You want me to fire it off? Sure. He wants no damage. He's not being me yet. What's once in all? Bush flakes. Yeah, yeah. Bush flakes. Oh, question about it. Which is why I stay away from it as much as possible. 529 votes. What's your take on Thursday's two anniversary of 9-11? 11 say I'm buying duct tape at this now. And now the new QAF. Oh wow. Somebody had reset this machine. Well I'd like to beat the crap out of them. I'm buying duct tape at this point right now 11. I won't travel that day 19. I'm saying post them all day 20. Bad smircle happened 20. So just you know a smattering. But what me worry 146. And nothing will happen. 313. See, they got to call me four and said, well I would be too obvious to do it. Well, maybe it wouldn't. Maybe it wouldn't. You know what I'm saying? Right. No, it's not probably the general feeling is that, oh, well, they're not going to do it again on the day. There would be so obvious this repeat on the second anniversary. Just like last year they were in of course you recall last year. He was using the tragedies of 9-11 to pump up support for this uh, a racket tack which subsequently they went and done. Under the guys of well we're fighting in the war on terror is never ending in all over the world in the audience. So you can go in here with the the Iraqi oil pipeline all the other crap, you know. They couldn't get the Afghan pipeline going so now it's the racket tack. You'll be probably in that we've decimated the country and kill Zidin's of people. Our people are done over there every day. And we got nothing but chaos and it's coming unglue and unraveled moment moment by moment. I just wonder no, in the midst of all this. Yeah. Why is it that most people live in trailer parks listen to country music? Oh, you know, one be gets the other. Is that what it is? Sure. I don't think you go into a trailer park and hear arrow smith coming from the speakers or Elton John. It's a little bit down. Huh? Oh, they have those trailer parks too. I'm talking about Well, this I was going to say the people on jury's finger, but then again, are there black trailer parks? Before without a doubt. You get out of here. I'll drive you as to some when you come back down. No. There are black people living in trailer parks. There are rural black people in case he didn't know. I'll be damned. By the way, Peter, you brought dropped out of the raisin California for governor. He just dropped out. How many votes did he have? But third man. I said I don't think so. El Paso is what he said. The former baseball commissioner Peter Uberop. He said his name was a little bit too confusing. Unlike the simple names on there like you know great Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Hello. Lawsuits blaming airlines the port authority and a boy company for each reason deaths in the 911 terrorist attacks can proceed if it was our jewel today. This just in. The defendants had argued that the suits should be dismissed because they had no duty to anticipate and guard against deliberate and suicidal aircraft crashes and because any alleged negligence on their part was not the cause of the injuries in his 49 page ruling. US district judge Alvin Halersstein said the port authority of New York and New Jersey which owns the world trade center property is not shown that it will prove its defensive government immunity is to negligent delegations made by WTC occupants. What is that? Is not shown that it will prove its defense. The judge also said the evidence he had seen does not support boy's arguments that the invasion and take over the cockpit by the terrorist freeze it from liability. The plaintiff said the link should have designed the cockpit doors to prevent hijackers from invading the cockpit. The plaintiffs that also argued that American United Airlines and the port authority were legally responsible to protect people on the ground with a hijacked aircraft smashed into the twin towers causing them to collapse. The ruling was based on the cases about 70 of the injured and representatives of those who died the 2000 one attacks on the WTC depending on the crash of a hijacked plane in Pennsylvania. I still realized that I'm a skeptic. Call me ignorant. Call me dubious and suspicious. But I'm still a little bit curious about how that long lag time you know between the first hour and the second one. Yeah. By the Indian and no interception. No, we spend the long long lag time. What was it like a half an hour? Sure. Me for the hit the Pentagon. I mean, you know, just just thinking out loud again. The middle Eastern world will be exploded to dominate people killed with the gas that we sold in. First time a griscer nation and the only one that's going. Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing forget about Korean. The nuclear tows will have a right wing is drilling it over and over into our head. Daddy, rock, has some weapons of past construction. Three thousand people killed. Our now forgotten. Let's exploit them instead. Hey, there's oil to be not in going after satown to play Kato's summer. There's no longer mentioned of the name in Latin but no enceived concern. All of this cartel is in a station that controls this by fear through media and manipulation and the right wing is drilling it over and over into our head. And I ragged hands up. Weapons of past construction. The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying. We're all suspects now. Not see as prompt this saying. I have nothing to hide. Table talkers all are saying. I know media and I don't have any reservations. Out of provoked, Babylon. World of the dilation. Old regimes must fall and have a virgin itself with no objection at all. Tell the crap don't have the fall and the right wing is drilling it over and over into our parade wash pad. I ragged hands up. That's the best structure. The whole media is right. And so. When the best is struck. Well, what a great job. Eric did on our website. Did you see that? Look at this. That stuff is up there. I'm rallying. More on how we feel our presidenties in town today.
