I'm confused when Joseph Gackie screams Oh my oh my is that from our hurricanes game or is that him dropping a load in this pants in 1992 when his airplane knows that Another house in Miramar Now see you know what that you know what that means back when we had her pain Her can't Andrew I was living in CS the key when that thing Okay, now remember in so Gackie we were all working the IOD together and he had a vacinas of his heart He got a rescue plane and three guys were taken so it relieved supplies down his outfit So they're playing crashes and we get worried that there were three people on a plane including Joe and two of them died Okay, so this is the kind of people we got out there is that from a hurricane game or is that Joe dropping a load in his pants in 1992 And his plane knows that about Hudson Miramar brutal. These people are great You're playing from my son. I didn't know his guy did it not yet I've been on a plane that had problems. I was with the thrashers one day And we were flying into DC and the thing bounce like an NBA ball for eight minutes and like 12 guys hurled all over the place I'm in two then everybody was bombing because when the pressure drops and it's oh There's nothing but that would be the worst way though best ever was coming back from Amsterdam on Martin Air one time Yeah, and we're in a brutal rainstorm in Miami Which could be any day as you're discovering and a plane we're coming in for landing and we get to within about 15 feet of the runway And there's bad winds you're in all of a sudden the pilot he changes his mind and we take off again Oh, I hate you can't even begin to imagine there were people praying I was saying hell Mary's I was rubbing my rosary one could be worse than going that What if you're at 30,000 feet and you and you drop out of the sky You know or what if you were on that plane and Pittsburgh that they were trying to fly into the capital can you imagine no I mean I think you are are you picking on the guy can you again? I'd hate to see what was in his pants You know You know something I'll give you a clue what's in his pants look at his face You don't you don't think they know I Be used to be changes I know where I mean they need does can you imagine He had me thinking about some of the stuff he's got carrying in there Jesus Christ that's enough to ruin my mind Have a great day.

I don't feel like I have the mung in here although John Jarris is a good guy He was in your earlier from power 96 and he said that he's been I think there's something in this building Also a lot of pussy's in this building or afraid oh kneels are gonna bring stars back. We better put him in a quarantine So you know that would have been a good scam. I should have gone into quarantine for a week and then just like That would have been a way to do it. You know what I'm saying? I think there's something going around this building Anyway, it's great to have for well here for many reasons I'm only easy to do it for entertaining and psychotic show, but Being here for a few days and getting to watch him eat See this guy is like a Mexican jumping being on drugs. I mean, he's just the maniac So as much as he's eaten in there He's before he even digested before it gets like into his colon. He's already burned it up Because he's like that he's spastic. He ought to be on television. Not just on radio So anyway, here's that facts again to start my morning. I'm confused. You're in the long confused But seriously, this is bad this evil talk about a bunch of brutal bastards out there when Joseph Gacky screams Oh my oh my is that from our hurcunes gamers that him dropping a load of his pants in 1992 when his airplane No stab at that house in Miramar And I'd be sure you're what a great business this is about two weeks after that happen And this ends a gacky just a survive. You know, he's just lucky could have been him He survived the plane crash and two weeks later. They fired him an IOD Thanks for the great job and help him say those people down there We're glad you didn't die to play crash your book guess what you're fired your ass is fired Wasn't even healed up yet now By the way, we love how he's I should mention that cuz all the way did pay for this last a bunch of food cuz Zach We'll be able to stand see fat people. They'll they don't share They do not share they want you to eat a lot, but you gotta get your own I say Well, seriously, they want you to eat like crazy, but they don't share what they got because otherwise they can't keep up that growth So Zach crayons who turns about how many times have we been through this we thought he was our friend See he's got one leg in both camps. You know he's staying in the most canches in case Just get yourself preserved. Is that what it is and he looks like he's been pickled Zach nice going Zach we used to think you were pretty good guy He's been hanging out with the beast too long. So yesterday we had what about 50 polls something like that And Jeff Cohen was in here from pizza law for give him a nice two hour commercial if you're welcome Jeff and the last pool Wasn't really a pool was our religion survey because Jeff thinks that 70% of the audience are Jewish and I kept telling you dreaming man You're dreaming well some of you guy, I'm please go eat it pizza law please Just to try to convince him to the opposite so we asked what religion are you we do that about once a year We got the look at a responses on their boner boy 1288 that was our third poll of the day that pretty impressive Pretty damn impressive especially this time of the year when there is nobody here. Thank you by the way for number one all your kids Being out of school a number two nobody being here See that's another thing for all those and understand even if the people here cared about baseball or the marlins or either of both There's nobody here anyway So any event like baseball which takes place primarily in a summertime.

short time we're gonna build the other one of course not movies that god no way anybody even reads about them over the next the 13 shows immediately older brains out thank Georgia's tell me he's gonna be doing like about a hundred movie shows this summer at least a week right here's our first poll which Q and this is a your own opinion okay which Q amp personality do you think despises how are David the most not that we want to get into personalities you understand but which huh based on what you here based on what people say based on that explosive run in the end with Joe Rosen Saturday I still can't get over that can you that was shocking the buzz in a hallway man people are like on a ceiling some of them do you see that yeah which Q amp personality do you think despises more how are David the most who's more how are David that's gotta be on her that choice George Neil Joe Rose the beast Hank mad dog any k i don't think any k hates anybody he's just a nice crack Carlos a k a beiner boy guilty Joe cash fellow or for out what about Zach the sack is not a Q amp personality we're not talking about board ops he's an impersonality he's a non human is what he is he's the excuse he gave me this more he's got like two bowling balls stuck in his stomach is what he said always that was the excuse yeah you talk about denial this man is in such an alzac you're not a bad guy okay you're a good Jewish boy but you're gonna be dead pretty soon I'll tell you what's gonna be dead yeah that's he's on a phone out good then he won't hear me talking about no it's seriously you have a death wish I said that as soon as you went downstairs for your fag break this is a man bacon don't don't be influenced by us because we don't want no lawsuits okay bacon is very very bad even though we do love how he's a lot they're great we love your house but bacon is bad for it'll kill you I went back to that McCulley a killmer uh letter was named is book again last night just to see if he said anything about bacon and he did yeah poison and he said oh carcinogens man uh nitrites mixing with all kinds of other chemicals in here and they are definite carcinogens in other words they're caused possible cancer causing agents that will eventually kill you so after this week I'm my lane off the bacon okay but since I'm here and since it's nice snack early in the day one thing I have discovered this is very strange and maybe it has nothing to do with bacon maybe it just has to do with eating like non carbohydrate foods in the morning because I've never been a breakfast eater but being diabetic when I eat the bacon early in the day like eight nine o'clock in the morning my blood sugar is much better than usual it seems to stabilize I don't know why I don't know why and that amazing maybe I just discovered something you think no I doubt it well it's sugar free so there's our pull a question pull number one we have another one coming up that will be building uh as we go through the show in regard to Greg co-tex's comedy I gotta be honest with you seriously some of you have to have like GA and this is beyond there's nothing else like this what are we going to do with those people what are we going to do a few ideas oh seriously what are we going to do with people or a sombset with the sports nerds chute them in the lake yeah I mean not with a real gun but let me be with a BB gun pretty lightly like a vehicle okay is that new pull going up there or not did I get I did give the result what are you want to say it's on the other pull he wants it you want on the other pull okay but I'm not looking at it he's not a celebrity okay hey he's not a physicist a fat tuba crap okay he's not a personality although and did you lose a little weight since I was your last time 30 pounds okay 30 blood syrup I told it first in his case that like one burning ball yeah how could you tell keep it up don't don't let the beast don't let that fat tuba crap the beast interfere with your weight loss okay if you let him influence you be dead by the end of the month I'm serious he's I just noticed that he actually the the t-shirt that size XX XX L anywhere it's like droop it a little bit but now the Roman Catholic Bishop of Phoenix was arrested yesterday and it didly hit run accident after police traded at a Christo license plate number to his car and found the windshield cave and I don't know how many people seen it on TV last night but it was and his comment was he thought he might have accidentally hit like a bird a plane maybe with Superman Bishop Thomas O'Brien 67 was driven away in an unmarked detective's car but he was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter because of his high blood pressure he was a little high his blood pressure too I was but the reason he may have been high was under a lot of pressure earlier this month it was announced that a Brian Relic was some of his authority in unprecedented agreement with prosecutors that spared him from indictment on obstruction charges for protecting child molesting priests I think like that right back where we started all over again there's no fact in the turn right right and I love Mohour David and of that discussion right so he hit run and then the best part of this is there said well you know this guy 43 year old Jim Reed that was the name of the victim in Phoenix he was a walking well I don't think Jim I guarantee you I'll ever do that no Mohour I'll cover yeah tell everybody who's that no Mohour he was Jay walking absolutely so I guess anybody could have a good hit for Jimmy O'Read Jay walking in the middle but usually when you hit a pedestrian like that and kill him you don't just drive away and say oh I think I might have been a bird you must have been a god damn big bird to put a bus into a windshield like that do you see that thing yeah the whole left side of the right side of the windshield like that all cave then maybe it was an albatross it could have been maybe maybe the bishops got an albatross around his neck now you think we can only pray contour you idiot you idiot in the church bishops will brine here's one of your good Irish Catholics for anyway we're gonna talk about that Jose can take off the means that's gonna be our real pull for the day because I just I'm just I mean first of all if it was somebody who was like a good guy you know somebody that everybody admired oh by the way Jim Cronen's dead anybody know who he was 91 years old never Jim Cronen and Jessica Tandy Hugh Cronen you saw the yeah cocoon right Donna meaty or all those old farts I think are they all dead now no what's his name was in it are Crony right not dead is not that now but Donna meaty Donna meaty was grabbed love Donna was great the bickerson's but anyway that's for old farts like me and mow and bokeh brine so we don't want to talk about him Cronen too much 28 past 10 we'll talk about Jose can suck oh and how much would you pay I would I wouldn't give you like 3 cent if he walked into building right in fact I'd pay 10 bucks to make sure he got his ass out just so we could all be safe we don't like Jose can suck oh on his show okay and here and I promise you I guarantee if I maybe he'll even call in Joe Sandor your pictures in the paper this morning Joey you look like a silly person you're making a clown out of yourself what you're entitled to do that it's a free country but you're a base celebrity now for paying 25 of our bucks to take your girlfriend of suck around in Jose can suck those house for four hours this town really does give new

eat out a living on that show he don't have no spare cash to you know siphon off to guilty besides that wasn't the way it worked out during the first team no it was Joe that no as a matter of fact was Joe Rose was the godfather to guilty he's the one to brought him in and default in guilty never really got along very well it was always that rift it was always that kind of like you know but we don't want to get into personality no so anyway speaking of personalities here's the story of the century which is and it's a throw away but it just caught my eye I think tomorrow we'll talk about Mike Mayos thing about to cell phones and school since I got you all worked up yeah send that for tomorrow we'll do a pull on it. All summer long we'll do a pull on but this one meeting con psycho it's not priceless not ordinarily anything red coat excess right I wouldn't have been waste your eye sight reading it okay but I saw the picture of this guy Joe Santor and in behind him is a smirking a smirking Jose can psycho I'm sure it's taken to himself this smuck is pay me 25 bucks to spend four hours in my house are you ready for this? I was not I was neither and the headline on the article by Greg Co. Texas meeting con psycho it's not priceless you can rent Jose con psycho for $625 an hour he graciously will open his south photo home to you and be your disposal for a barbecue for a batting lesson for lasting quality time in the pool and for no added charge you'll enjoy the company of Joe's Jose's exceptionally friendly German weamerate why mariner hunting dogs zoos and zina it'll be just you your cock official ex communicated baseball heroist sniffing bottle hit dogs and the unobtusive friend slash witness will quietly be in the house at all times to make sure you don't put yourself into the face get all bloody hysterically closed and then speed dial you return you are you following this they have an in-house witness a horizon going one of those days but I I didn't say that I said that going and I was supposed to play absolutely yeah hired going how come we didn't put that in here yet I just got it it's fresh you just got that that was a mothing yeah from this morning off he damn I'm telling you he's got there there's a little part of it you and I don't he would never believe this he'd never believe it but you you in spite of all the crap he's done there's something about him that makes you want to like him but you can he makes it impossible to do it even makes still I'm serious there's something I you look at him and you kind of like chuckle and you think be maybe because we're thinking of the character both rhymes mold no now you're laughing I know seriously you know what I'm talking about there's the real mow and then there's the uh the character another train monkey right which granted the characters a lot more amusing but nevertheless there's there's a party mow we would like to or like if we could find it we'll let you know what it is anyway goes on I'm the poster child for lawsuits explains the prudent host meaning hosecun sucko and so the bizarre light latest chapter the hosecun sucko story in progress unfolded yesterday inside the gated community of long-leicestates in Davy you're going to make it a point me to go over 625 well I'll tell you what how about four there's a hundred and about 130 get a 15 minutes hundred 30 bucks I would fail or I don't get it or a little over two bucks you can go in there for a minute and like pee on a carpeting or something there's there's a lebertop your pants and pitalove you know there's celebrities you like like they Jared leader or something like that how much would you pay? I wouldn't pay all right anybody a dime I wouldn't pay anybody a penny I'm just not a groupy and I have nothing but revulsion for groupies which is one of the reasons I stopped doing those appearances and so I mean look I don't want to sound ungrateful there's a lot of people support this show for years not kind of what I appreciate that very very much but people that want my autograph let me just say that there's something wrong with you okay? no no seriously why would anybody want my autograph to wear the flesh? no seriously why does anybody want my autograph to prove that they ran into you? oh show their friends look I like that guy in Phoenix and the bishop he don't want my autograph absolutely no he don't want it you know I'm getting a little bit concerned I don't think we're gonna see peanut boy and he knows something I bet he didn't lose the keys but this is just a new scam he's got he's gonna come up with some different story every day as he's probably out there a smoke and something I don't think he's standing in the rain is it is we have four and had a half a dozen he's out there trying to tape this queen over his open window drive careful on away home for ralok just remember there's something really luscious waiting for you on the other rancid raviour careful make sure you get to rely he's really a good guy you're right guy see you're first impressions of people I know you got bitched out by somebody but you're not always right but generally speaking because there was one day when I had a little bit of you remember that day I do about for ral because you never know no don't want to make too many jugglers are from big act right but it's just him right he's a spaz and he's a spaz he acts in speaks exactly off the air the way he's on air there's there's no act there for it there's no and that's just him the boy can't help it as bizarre as that may sound and almost unbelievable is probably as the most of you that that's just him he's a hoot he's a trip she's a crazy person that we like that he's brought some of the fun back into this radio station and it's long overdue because believe me the last 17 months in this station or whatever it has been 14 months haven't exactly been fun okay you know what I'm saying oh oh man hostile working but oh hostile nasty uh everybody walking on egg shells and now you notice what's it comes about 805 and a moment is like on his way up the Hershey Highway during his big jaguar or whatever it is all of a sudden everything lightens up big time even the weight in the bullpen they're lighting up a couple of ounces because everybody's running around their water that around are coming in to eat because they want to leave me out there and and we're just having a good time in the old nine of our drugs it's great anyway I'll get back to the things so the pole we're gonna do what's we dispense with this first one here which y'all you can help us build this pole okay where'd I hold this if you got it I got it though who's house would you pay 625 dollars an hour to visit huh I got Jose can say co then I got the one I'm gonna vote for nobody and then after that we'll find out the never land ranch and it and and probably somebody will say my house well guess what no none of you could have a lot you know some of them might be able to come into my house but for different reasons I gotta send pictures first like my right my good friend Erin remember Erin you'll pay them 625 dollars an hour I would not no I would not no I would not all oh Erin's case not maybe about half of that can we can we like deal for about 20 minutes or sounds good than that 1057 at 560 QAM yeah roll right we not see Republican mother say the money is bonus who we're in their own mother I'll let you gonna say that when it comes in your back as they bake your board that train right we not see Republicans mother well it just ain't enough just have luck feeling the airways with hate me the radio was permeated with

I find out he's back in town I like having Greg the business when I know for sure he's around 76 people say the personality of the Q and personality despises how we're divided the most kneel 76 even

mad dog 12 the b6 80 k5 I don't believe that do no I don't ever see it he's right I mean it's possible I guess Zach for beiner boys made the list you're by the way beiner boy found his keys let's hear it oh you idiot sir so I get more and I just from watching uh and hearing about his uh escapades a try to live life not doing anything exciting but just get like from the time he gets up at a morning till the time he hits the second night just try to make it through a day the keys were on the ground the street in the lot in the parking lot on the pavement as he went racing out there to close the windows in his car oops a Zach crans has got four big fads Zach but not as fat as he used to be Carlos two is for else got one and Joe Custilla one because I guess they figured Joe Custilla is too nice if we got to hate anybody at least admitted and Feral has been here long enough to hate Mo yet plus he's getting free beers off him so anyway here's the pull question are we gonna change it now and I will build this one while they don't believe they're the one I'll tell about love and third year noon anyway it says the bizarre blade is chapter of this Jose can take us to rain progress on foot of yesterday inside a gated community of longest day lakes and Davy if you're expected there like history making fan Joe Santa was yesterday you glide past the uniform guard hang a fast right and

an additional guy I'd like to find out what the additional cost was wouldn't you no con psycho always has been the athlete's center admired the most I've been a huge fan for 13 years you said Jose spoke his mind but what would Jose be like in person and then a co-zone about this and about a bit of how pleasantly was in a girlfriend said he was a pleasure to be around a joy I didn't even know if he would speak to us at yaddi yaddi about Jose's problem with steroids and with guns and with the beaten up backs of wives and girlfriends all of these other relates things and great co-tex says one of magic's a virgin and cottage industry for faded former stars who are either retired against their will or striving to hang out of their retreating celebrity what are we bid for brunch with hell grier how about grocery shopping with Jim kick I'll be a kick uh kick in a pantalinese I mean seriously how much of a sickle fan can you possibly be to spend money to be allowed to go into somebody's house and just hang out I think that's the end I think this is the ultimate I think we have finally reached the end of life as we once knew it it's just it's impossible I can't believe it I mean memorabilia okay here's an autograph Facebook an autograph jock strap an autograph golf ball that mow what's found up his ass whatever you could sell that at least yeah it's something tangible it's

time at QAM and we hate that see I I'm for the first time since I've been listening since he's been in town I noticed that for else finally start to get a glimmer because this morning he was really bitching out this town about you know 10600 people at that game last night the medicine of Marlins on a Monday night no rain like I said no excuses they just don't care you can't force people to care and it's gotten out the money that's the lowest price sports ticket in town for professional team that's always a convenient excuse well those Panther games my god across three hundred bucks to take my kid okay well let's excuse for this they don't care they're not interested and you can stand on your head and I give credit for trying to do that we've all been through that we've all tried to force feeds something because we thought would be good for the for yeah for the community for the team for something and they just don't care like that's the raggedy of the day about buying up those Panther Dallas tickets years ago and then having people take them for free and scalp them and sell them for like five bucks about whatever and how they can get for them maybe some people were lucky enough to get eight bucks I don't know certainly not much more than that it's a deadhead place look at look at this look at it and respond I mean we've got a few under now but I'm sitting here begging for calls again we finally got some of our problem solve we got a lead and I'm gonna show we got back to ten to two which everybody's ecstatic about we got beiner boy in there found his keys rocker more could you want we got the the hot couple contest is up on here you got a few a couple of hooters to look at and you got some pretty interesting people we got a good selection from nice looking to

Neil Rogers shows been rained out today oh yeah rained out twenty seven years of this begging pleading squeezing like like doing a great prude you know and we don't even have one of those uh a squeezy things what do they call those things you say you know what I'm talking about what was a little juicer it's got the thing that sticks up and you put your oranges in your citrus on air in the idea think it's called the juicer it's called a little do what you're confusing with the uh juiciman juicer with the eyebrows ever see him with Andy runny together now same guy same guy the juiciman scissors you know here here's Delray Beach hello hey Neil little mistake you're making is asking the audience whether they like something or not because every time you do that they stab you in the back and they basically don't show up again you know if you do it you're the mistake I'm making it on what oh when you when you're asking the audience they want it that do the movie thing and then they say they don't want to do it I and now let me ask you did you enjoy the shows on the movies yeah yeah but see I don't get to see as many movies as you do I am out here working hard and you know so it's interesting to me because you're doing it right because I'm turning out of some things you might want to pick up yeah and it's the same with the you know it's a bedtime story I like a little bit of all that stuff you could ask and do it's in your gut right that's right you right need a butcher up a little bit even after all these years I need a butcher up quit being such a pussy absolutely you got to do it you're right you know what's successfully you've always done the right thing yeah but I've always always always had the same like a response it's not me it's this town it doesn't make any difference it doesn't make it a difference what you do they're not happy you can't please these people man I'll let and even if you give me something for free I remember giving away tickets to some concert or something on this and and oh don't you have anything better than this I mean don't you have better seats than this than these nosebleed seats no Neil when you chase when you chase a dog it runs yeah you're trying to chase a dog when you do that you need to just do what you do keep your bedtime story the few I feel like I'm chasing a goddamn perry dog is what I feel like I really don't have a great day pal thanks for your help that that guy's right we were rolling we were getting a phenomenal response everything was fine and then I made that bad mistake like he says he's got to step on it that one pull it isn't warm in here because it doesn't it it is it's warm in here because I heard for all this morning just foaming it to my I think the AC is busted or something because it said 71.6 maybe like 81.6 that could be when I go look at play that absolutely a few times I got a absolutely maybe it I don't know maybe it's me maybe I'm getting something from high or taught I'm shfitsin in here oh my god because the thermostat says 70 which ought to be nice and pleasant ought to be I just turn it down to 69 I just thought I mentioned that get a lot of people upset let's see knee lab would love to spend a full day at the Neverland Ranch with Michael Jackson where where is your nose Jackson Rachel you a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit said okay little joke maybe it's a bad pull maybe we should just leave the other pull up all they what do you think I think they like it better it's hate okay I'm easy I mean we can still talk about this I mean don't people have any thoughts about a guy that spends 225 of her bucks maybe they agree maybe they don't think there's a problem with it like we do over there just don't have the ball to say because it's too embarrassing to say it in public well I seriously I think if you want to pay somebody to spend I mean okay if it's a hooker but you're technically not paying for the time in their house you know you're paying for the service which you can be doing out on a guy named Street for all that matters it's not really important whether it's in a house whether it's in a pub tent that's not what you're paying for but to have the honor of being in somebody's house this is got to be one of the most stupid things I've ever read in my life and it's typical of this radio station people who are obsessed with jokes with superstars with movie stars and TV personalities and singers most of them are crap even people that we like William Holden great actor when I favorites died with a bottle in his hand see what I'm saying most of them have screwed up lives they're neurotic they're divorced 50 times they they drug-addicted Robert Downey Jr. you know what I'm saying they like the scum yeah how about if we paid to go inside somebody's house who's a nice person see this boy that's boring what would be the point of that I'm a nice person no but I want to go to your house no that's for that matter neither do you here's my me be tello yes sir oh about six ten I have an update the tower canons out with the kiddables to get you stay with the condos where the you were afraid the tower was gonna fall on him right well the kiddables came down they won what does that mean well did the tower fall and the kid was out the guy was there hitting the tower up no not well it is of now how's it now yeah it's just running by the look the kid was gone so what does that mean that they're off the air no they're still on there but I guess the tower's not going to fall on the condos no more so it's so where they broke has to wear it so they had to build a new tower somewhere yeah they put up a new tower because it looks freshly painted and it looks a little bit smaller oh but in the same place yeah the same place right in the middle of the parking lot there were the added sure yeah and the other thing one other thing for them yeah and I'm doing a bit with my neck and the transmitters say well nobody can take over his show have a great day pal put where you're behind how do you like that was that something there was that something what you can't say the word on the ear Beno Schmidt five six seven I was trying to watch handle six news last night I couldn't do it I just couldn't do it I you know because I've tried to find an alternative to four because Angel raised a simple then she's an idiot she's an embarrassment so try to find an alternative and I can't I cannot do it with her good friend Joe Rose on there in fact that was one of the reasons that motivated me after Joe's brilliant performance on Saturday I thought I owe it to him you know well he was not in the last night anyway I don't even know when he is on he's on whatever he feels like he's got to do like the mad dog he shows up when it refills like it kind of like all of us have your cue a and away things are going today I George is going to be on a marable you look at the schedule being a what doesn't say if there's a George Wednesdays and then I think Thursday in Friday this week I just penned five six seven oh five sixty pound I would miss it for the world man would miss this bonding with his crowd for the best here's Miami hello yeah sir please retire no okay I don't think so okay please retire same asshole okay who won't turn it off but he wants me to retire I'll retire why I'm good and ready asshole here's Weston hello how you doing Neil okay you know what the deal is with the autographs there's one something for free in this town and they think that after you croak the autograph might be worth the money yeah oh who's that anything about an autograph you would say before who would want your autograph oh I I see what you're saying but I mean this kind of pay twenty-five or bucks it doesn't even say if Jose autographed anything for him which I doubt yeah well that was crazy if if I wanted to pay somebody to spend some time in that house it might be somebody I wouldn't but it might be somebody like Neil Neil Armstrong or Edmund Hillary somebody I would talk about something that they did that I you know would like to do myself look at him you you might spend money to have them come into your house and tell you about it well I would spend money to spend some time to speak to them you know like a one-on-one thing I don't think I spend that kind of money yeah something like that how much but not for a sportshold how much would you spend for Edmund Hillary to come into your home and talk about his exploits how much how much what does the pen that how much money that I had you know it depends on what based on how much money you do have based on I mean you must have some idea what you got why would you be an answer I'm out of embarrassing but once you mean answer you'd spend a thousand dollars for a Hillary Clinton to come into your house Edmund Hillary Edmund from guiding light and Hillary Clinton have a great day good idea he knows he's just can he wouldn't spend fifty cents these people first of all we're asking around crowd anyway oh I forgot for just a second there I forgot where I was which is not easy to do if it's free

needs to be a wife of convenience and it's pretty muchended with that Bill is such a horned out he probably would have never noticed I had man like X anyway and Chelsea well if you buy my book you can read all about the affair I had with Sandra Bernhardt and our lunch aisle now I wasn't born a Democrat I switched parties after looking in the mirror and seeing the body of Tiponeo so buy my book now because I can never have enough if you order a copy today I will personally autograph the all-newed scratches to fall down 32 or 560 can you believe that skipping just given here in the middle of the show and was a bop-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba can you believe that Jeff Cohen coming in and monopolizing your show he wants his own show so bad I said you ought to take the commission to the bank and just smile on your face okay you realize how long Jeff Cohen and a piece of lot to be on their show and he's coming in here like uh like half apologizing he's making money for doing nothing do you think that pony tail would have sat down if I wouldn't have encouraged him to do it and it sure has helped beat the hell out of sitting here begging for calls for two hours or however long he was in here he was very amusing entertaining tidalating uh yeah b.s. a lot absolutely so we're gonna leave the first pull up there because the second one just ain't making it you know and as a result you know when you have people out there got up to the say it's the same happened as in the same 10 the same 15 the same crow won't you return you jump back the same crud of the idiots but turn to man yeah that's how many there are like Wayne once said about the sports nerds there's a hundred the same hundred called as I think it was exaggerating five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line here's a call from Orlando hello yeah good morning yeah sure um I think there are three on a lot of people in our calling is because I mean it's too bad that it had to be with somebody like those they can set go to let people in you know I mean if you were somebody worthy in other words like an example for kids or something but then that's exactly why I asked the question and these people don't have anybody and maybe they're smart enough they wouldn't spend the which you know is maybe it's a compliment and I think it's better to also do that a whole taken set go he's probably doing that bad financially because he can't make money because he's on house arrest that he has the stoop to that I mean that's you know but I mean I you know I mean I think if I'm the decision is already ruined so I get this really he's gonna make too much difference yeah this is like Pete Rose going on a shopping that we're peddling his baseball cards another man member video and then signed baseballs on this other crap because he's got the gambling problem and he needs to constantly keep replenishing that the the money supply yeah so I'm stuck those hundreds on the table as a track yeah I think I think the reason also while a lot of people are not calling is because I guess that anybody that's worth while wouldn't shoot to this level so I think it's kind of like you know I don't really think that it's because people don't enjoy the poll at the it's kind of like a catch twenty two you know you're right it was a bad poll because they're either going to say they're going to say nobody most people to bring us say nobody we wouldn't pay yeah nice talking to you know thanks a lot pal you know most of the first poll like you said it's a lot of hostility a lot of hatred which they enjoy tremendously because it lets them on least their penner first racings from living in his goddamn swamp is it still raining out there is a nasty another one he's because I'm not going to be

Then you feel it, Jenny, a plunder, for all your water and natural gas. Oh, I wonder wonder, who do you want? We drop the bomb on the lawn. What's the few dead babies they did in supper long? We sure show them a thing or two, I could read right around. We're like wonder wonder, whom the new do you want? We drop the bomb on the lawn. I wonder why we got the bomb on the lawn.

I sure hope the weather cooperates tomorrow. Would that big for wealthy and evolved park tomorrow night? Would he's big in me to go out there? Your great guy's got the answer is still no chance. I told him this morning, I said if you paid me by the pitch, I would not go out there. Would you? I mean, you're talking to Carlos. Carlos is trying to get you laid out there, which of course would be bad if your wife's listening right now and offering all these beautiful young things that he's going to have in a pool, you know, fish and for a grouper. And he's still on co. No. Especially now that your wife heard about it. Anyway, Frank and Liz had 96 votes on our hot couples contest. We're getting a lot of votes on that thing. Brian and Natasha 48, they're no small potatoes. Holly and Darren have got 38. Did you think that this was going to be a runaway? No, I did not. And Lisa Farad is, which shocks me. Marian Shane 33, Mike and Kristen 26. Ian and Jen. 24, Vicki and Mick 23. Greg and Stephanie 21. Captain, sing in his wife's 16. Get the, and I don't understand, Danny and Michelle 14. They should be doing a little bit better than that. I'm not, I'm not trying to push for anybody because this is a very even group. And then there were some that, well, but, you know, then in Sherry of that 11 votes, uh, Jo, Jo, the in Kevin and got six. And it goes to show you see some people would assume that just because you're showing Bear hooter, that those are going to get like in the first one. Then they could couple came in a close second. It was a little more to it than that. I said, hooter, not couter. Three votes for Rick Rich and Sheryl. And she's got a couple of big hooters hanging down there. What? I just found out what that actually means. I don't want to know. Turtle. Is that what it means? Yeah. Here's some good news for you, okay? Because I want to give myself back in a really good mood. Because this audience throws you off a little bit. You know, everything's been going to God damn well. See, and it's kind of like, well, you know, are you going to be happy and spite of us, uh, uh, yeah, we don't care if you're miserable. We want to be happy over here. We'd like just just for a few months. After all, a misery in the grief we've gone through here last after 14, 15 months of hell of living hell. Thanks a lot, Greg. A judge is, this is great. New George was excited about this. He wants him always going to check. A judge in Portland, Maine has approved a settlement agreement in a music anti-trust lawsuit that will result in more than three and a half million consumers receiving nearly $13. Oh, right. Judge D. Brock Hornby issued a 51 page ruling that the day in a case it began in 1996. But attorneys general across the country began investigating whether distributors and retailers are conspired to inflate CD prices. This settlement will put cash in the hands of millions of consumers and music CDs in libraries and school throughout the country and will ensure that the challenge distributor slash retail prices will not resume Hornby Road. The ruling Harvard does not stipulate exactly how much consumers will receive when a checks will be distributed more than three and a half million consumers filed claims now estimated to be $12.63. I mean, we talked about this for a long time. How long ago was that? About 50 years? Yeah. I'm going to give you a good thing. You're going to get some proof. Sometimes you got to wait for it. The ruling, however, let's see. Hornby asked Lori to present him with a report by the amount of how much it will cost to distribute the checks. How much each check will be. Well, by the time they take out the postage and the handling and the bookkeeping, right? 20 fees. A 20 fees. Oh, then they got it. It's got a certified like the price. How many cents do you think you're going to get back? About 30. About 30 cents. How to 12.63. Hey, don't take anything. It's kind of like when a stock broker has lost your fortune. You know, and then you can turn around and sue. The bet now, listen to me. The best way you look at that is if you get 10 cents. It's 10 cents you never expected to see again. You're going to die. And it's why I look upon that. I don't want to get into specifics on a year. No, and that's just like you can't just take that kind of stuff. Line down on people like pull all kinds of crap on you. They're old congene and those are your people out there. Get all excited about the market is going up again. All I can say is good luck to you because I don't believe it. What goes up must come down. Yeah, well, not only that, but there's there's something going on. And we this isn't the first time we've seen this. Because generally speaking, except for all of us little fish in the pond, there are a handful of, relative handful of people who really could manipulate these markets for their own fun and amusement and profit. And just as a time when people are saying, hey, what about those weapons and mass destruction? What about all those dead people? What about all this crap that's still going on every day? What about the fact that a war was spawned based on nothing but lies? A bigger friend? Where are you? What is this man talking about? Is your mic open and you don't know it? Oh, none of my lights work. I thought he said, I'm an in-middle of like, quantificating here. I'm going through this and he's like, where are you, we're calling from? Answering the phone. Jesus Christ. I don't know. I wonder where I have an problem. You're answering the phone. Didn't I tell him yesterday going to answer the phone this week? I'm bitch in the audience. I've taken that thing off you. This week I said, while I'm here. While being your boy is over there pretending to be dealing with his computer. Look at a porno. I thought that was just a delusion that I had. No. Christ, I don't want to make you have to talk to a bunch of idiots for a while. I've talked to a bunch of idiots for four hours. Isn't it bad enough you have to sit in there with him and try to find his body parts when he keeps losing him? Left his left nut in the sink. That's what I got so excited when he heard the Tom Brady's was available. No, seriously. I mean, it's just it's so pathetic. It's so sad. I've never in my life. I've been around a hundred years. I've never encountered anybody like Beiner Boy who just. Every facet of his life is screwed up. Everything he does. He's like bad luck slump. If he takes a shower, the nozzle falls on his head. If he tries to wash his hands, the cold water comes out. It's burning hot, scol's him. I am the one I'm talking about. The, you know, the slump. Everything he does turns to instant process. Crack. We don't know why. He was just born with that dark cloud over his head. Geniuses have eccentricities. Yeah, but what's your excuse? He's the genius. Here's Carl Springs, hello. Anya. Yes, sir. I don't know how much I would pay, but I urge this guy to help get the lot of sunlight. I'd like to hang out with Beiner Boy on the deoverbat, eh? Okay. We did about it. I'm done. Helpering the Sun Tan, Lotiony said. He'll let you hang out with him for a coke. I see if I would've been right on top, but I'm really no care. I just don't care anymore. He said not for a coke. Yeah. Or some. And plus this thing I'm working anymore. Right now, this thing is like having all kinds of a fit. It puts the nourishing in the bars. 560, 50560 pound, 5060 on the air. We're really the screenless here. Okay. So if it's ringing, just let the keep ringing. We don't want George to have to go through that again. Let's screw it up for the first two hours today.

You're not the only one in the building that hate him. We hate him out here. You know, you're a little bit. Any special reason? What you're laughing, you know. I'm laughing because of the way you said it with such ventom. Well, there is ventom. You know, he's right. He's a ventom. Well, he blames you for fomenting the hate against him. When you would just have to into it because it exists. There. Yeah. Did it ever dawn on him that maybe he created in the first place? Oh, absolutely. He created it. In addition to being an old, unlikeable, unfunny outsider, crottles the chronics like one from Little LaVanna, stuttering Steve Larry from Hollywood, Richie from Bores hit Mark the Disney.

Well, then why him if they don't something about it? You know, they have, they already have. They've started. Have you noticed a little tangent schedule here lately? Well, yeah. I want to give you a kiss on the way out the door. Well, you know, it took them about two months for them to realize Ron Hershey was in the stake. Yeah.

Yeah, I'm hanging up. And I'm going to get off all the way. It works the lotion in the basket. God. It's not the cooler off in here very fast if it is at all. It stopped cooling off.

I turn on the heat. Whatever I like. And it's just to just fine. On a nice spring day. I crack open a window. Have no crack problem. Everything is just fine.

It says, that's just my personal feeling. Don't take it personal unless you want to. Folks, it's just my feeling about being in this swamp, which is why if you look around, you'll notice that all kinds of people are gone. I can't imagine why they're gone. They flew from this place. They, they ran out of here like there was guy named Boofo Toads in their ass. Like there were civic cats on their dinner table. Like there were prairie dogs chasing him.

But anyway, in the concourse G, there used to be a place where you'd go in and get the hot dogs. We need a soft to my screen. Stop. Yeah. You don't talk about it right. And all of a sudden, it disappeared. It was like just a big wall there. While they were controlled without somebody getting smeared. It was a little bit of a problem. That's right. Somebody's got to get greased. There's what I'm saying. Back to them. Oh, I don't want to get tough out to nervous. No, no, seriously. He has gone through such a traumatic few weeks here.

I call it a good my guess, but that's not what we were told by Tommy, who's like, you know, Tommy. Yeah, but he was like, Tommy, like smoking a pot and stirring it. Not necessarily in that order. Tommy looks great. Doesn't he? I had no idea he looked like that. I didn't need for when he first walked in there yesterday. I didn't even know who the hell was for about a second and a half. Tell you, saw the Mohawk. That's still there. No, no, seriously. He's not a bad looking guy. I'm not saying that I'm like, you're got the hotse for Tommy. Cause you'll make some comment because you're in idiot. No, no, seriously, but he's really a pretty good looking guy. It's amazing how I've seen this before. Especially with young people. Young people who could really look good and then they like, screwed themselves all up and they got the ring and their nose. Their hair is like all out of, you know, Bring in the eyebrow and then all of a sudden one day they wake up in a morning. They look at the merits. So you look like crap. And they go in a new, new, and they like shave off the schmutz that they like clip. And you see, see because what they'll discover later on in life is that when when we really start getting old and nasty looking like most of the rest of us, then they'll say, she wants to pound a time. I could have really looked pretty good. So why do you have the opportunity to do it? That's why I don't want to tell you what to do, you know? Just like these assholes. Retire, stick up your head.

Requiem, even though I don't know what the title means, but it was a fantastic movie. Was it? But I want to kill you when it comes to Magnolia. You maybe want to this last night. I stayed up half the night. Trying to figure out what the heck was that about. You didn't like it? The ending. What was that? This is our. What was that, Neil? You have me say that just like just trying to figure out what the heck was that. It was strange, but just like all movie was strange. The two cities. What's the second city about? I looked at it yet. On the DVD. I can say. It's the movie in chronological order. It's the frog's fall and numbers on her back. Like at a race track. Oh. That's it. That's it. The other one is got like the interview. The other one's not really all that exciting for Magnolia. I was like, I was hoping it was like the game was the first year was on that man. No, no chance. You got to think about it until you actually put you into a padded cell. I got a couple of things. I mean, the one is the. Yeah. I don't know if you've seen snatch it. I am. Haven't seen snatch yet. I've got to try to talk me into it, but I haven't seen snatch yet. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. That's just great. Come, pal. Yeah. I'm talking about the addition to the Amal Coast. It's it would seem so on the movie. There were there about shaking your head vigorously. Do not do that. I'm saying don't do it. And also, um, play what I mentioned. Wouldn't you like, play at least 40 bucks to go there and check out that place? Why would I do that? Well, why don't you all tag like me when you go to play boy mansion? But you're not here, but I know George and I would play. George would like to go there if you'll play. Yeah. He said he's on his way right now. Or the, or have a hundredth house, you know, like, George and all were talking about that. Yeah, I pay about 20 cents to go to Tom Brady's house. I don't know if it's for the parking meter. We just, just for the pay for part. And ever right day pal, quit while you're head. Hi, I got out of here. I could see him in that movie somewhere. I was going to say he's here right in, but I don't think that little apartment is served. But he buttered his ribs. Yeah. Oh, he likes it when he buttered the ribs. Hahaha. Hahaha. Buttered the bacon, buttered the ribs. Just buttered the pork. And what he says. Tough was saying something about that before, but. Anyway, here's the fact that it's, it's not going to butter him. That says I'm not a motha, but it's been a year of relentless ridicule. Oh, this must be, uh, this is bad, I mean, I'm starting to feel sorry for this guy. Good, that's what we're trying to do. Is he that much of a prick? Yes. Does anyone understand that the head of friendship with this man we tried? By the way, is it one, the, uh, tile man from Hylia? One is the tile man from Hylia. I, I, I, I, I don't know who that is. It's just a chronic pain in the end. It's not that you have back room. You might want to check out your home. Oh, we got to prove. We got swing and mo.

If I told you I wasn't Miami right now, right by the date, Howard line, you wouldn't know either. That's part of the magic of radio. Just, just that to carry off. Why do you go to Toronto? Because I love it. Oh, yeah? Good. No two reasons. Number one. I love it there. Number two, which is even, uh, I hated here. Because I've got a lot of friends who live in Ottawa. I don't know it.

Oh, those pugs. No. 1250 or here's one. Carlos says, love the picture. But if you look at it closely, it's mole-rapping mole not you. It is. Refresh it. No, I'm not on that page. Just relax. I'll find a way to get to it. It's mole-rapping mole. No, see. How you, sir, better look a little closely. I mean, look at the glasses. See, most pictures. You don't have no glasses on. If you look at me, I mean, it's pretty obvious. I mean, do I look like mole? No, no. 1259. What am I doing here? Because I'm getting way behind. We don't want to do that.

This is spectacular when you consider it especially, that they're not only checking out Mo raping Neil, and they're also checking out the couple contest. We got them real busy, which is good on our rainy day. Keep your office straight and do not let your kids look at those nipples on our pictures. We warn you, don't say we didn't warn you. If you're sensitive about ladies nipples, and sometimes they're pretty sensitive too. Right? So I've been told, the don't be able to show pictures. Anyway, which QN personality do you think see here? We go nice going, Eric. He did it. He corrected that grotesque, glaring error of his. Which QN personality do you think despises Mo Howard David and the most? This is just for fun. We like him a lot. 668 votes. Neil, 216. Where did they get that from? You know? Gildy 117. Look at that. I'm almost 100 votes ahead of the second place guy. George 95, who continues hanging right close to Gildy's ass. Who's Mo Howard David in 74? Joe Rose 41, Mad Dog 39, Humper 32, who ought to be hardened at. These 27, Scott for Rall 7, 80K's got 6. Zach Krances got 6. Nice going, Zach. Bener Boy 5 and Joe Costello only three votes out of 60, which means in this audience Lys Joe Costello a lot of things he's a nice guy or they know who he is. Right? They know who he is. They think they're. Don't forget by the way, a marginally rated overnight Joe and Mark show, which used to be on to the 6 on 2 to 5 overnight. So now Sunday through Thursday. Right. Am I right about that Sunday through? I want to make sure I get that right. Correct. And they actually have it on the schedule right here. That's probably because Clarence ain't here this week. So the schedule's right. Don't be not in Clarence. He gets me paid on time sometimes that day early every day. He is the best. And I do want to retract something I said yesterday because if I'm wrong, I'll tell you. If I change my mind, I'll tell you. So I'm driving home yesterday. Maybe George has an opinion too because I'm listening to the game from Omaha. Oh yeah, I was listening to that. And because I really ripped and I keep in mind, I've always said I like Joe's and I keep personally a lot. It's business not personal. Right. Right. And I don't know. He probably hates me anyway, but at least when he comes into building once a day. Well, he puts on a good act and we shake hands and he smiles and mothers under his breath. Especially when I call him penis face. But I like Joe. There's no reason not to like Joe's a gackie, right? When you agree with that? Correct. He's a likable guy. Yes he is. But his work on the air and my estimation over the years is left something to be desired. Especially his play by play. They crushed it. You know that kind of stuff. You know what I mean? Oh my. What? I'm driving home yesterday and I'm thinking to myself, I'm prepared for the worst. And Joe is doing the hurricanes against that girl school, Southwest Missouri State for the Blind. By the way, don't forget Texas and the hurricanes tonight. It's an elimination game. Somebody's going to be out. That's at 8 o'clock on 790 Waxi because we got the Marlin game on QA. So the college world series Texas hurricane game will be on Waxi 790 8201 of our tour. And I'm listening to Joe and quite frankly, it was a lot better than what I'd heard him before. Not great. Still got a long way to go. And the biggest problem he's got to overcome. Not his lack of knowledge of what he's describing. I'm a clarinet for the good job out there too. See now I can understand why clearance went. Yeah. No you know why? Because if clearance didn't go to do the color on the games, you know who would have been out there? Yes. Okay. I've rest my case. Amateur hour. The beast. Who continues coming in here sucking around even though we don't want to see him. But you can't chase him away. One of those people. But Joe is actually improved a lot. Now the football thing. Uh, that's why I draw the line. It's one thing to get excited to play by play. Oh my. Oh my. Right. Even that's fine. But the hysterical outer controls screaming. It controlled excitement enthusiasm excitement under control. That's how you do play by play broadcasting. Believe you me because I know a little bit of booted. But just hysterical, shrieking and yelling and carrying on is just not. Oh my. Oh my. Not my idea of what I want to hear somebody describe in a ball game. No, no, no, no. I see even that's under control. He's not all. Don't ever knock the mad dogs work on a dolphin game. Then you'll have to cross my fat old body. Okay. Because I love the mad dog. He's just he is one and a billion. He's phenomenal. But again, even as an outer control as it sounds, it is still under control because it's legitimate. Whereas Joe did. And like he just got a control little bit. But his work on a baseball was much better than I expected. I was going Joe. I like Joe. And I figure if I see that maybe Hank will come in one day this week. Actually, look at us. Huh? I haven't seen Hank in a long time. And probably the reason you don't want to come in early is because last time I was in town. A couple months ago, Hank was sitting out there doing dittling something out at the, what used to be out there by the fax machine. Card table. Was that where we had the, the hand radio to the bookie? Because that's thanks for a lot of time. But seriously, he was out there when he bonded. And I made some comment. He looked like he gained an answer to you know, where we had the hand. And I love Hank. I'm worried that I don't want him to, to cope one of these days, which we all will eventually, but I'm talking about like not soon. And so maybe he's concerned now if I asked you, would you give me an honest answer? When's the last time you saw the Humper? Maybe last week. Okay. And his, he maintained his felt, you know, did just tell me he hasn't ballooned up anymore. Okay. He hasn't ballooned up any less. Or more. You, you are, you know, more is right about you. You're a friend that you saw him. Well, I didn't, but I tried to ask him a diplomatic way because I was fat people. Some of us are sensitive water. Wait, I'm not because I'm just, I can't do it. He can't do it. He can't do it. That's bad. I can't believe you're doing this to me. You're throwing my buddy Hank out of the tracks here. And he's going to hate you pretty soon. No, I want Hank to live. I like Hank. Yeah, we're trying to worry. But it doesn't work since I was a part of the work. I've tried that. It doesn't work. Now, Zack, I am burst into it with all sorts of work. Pull me all the engineering that we love our former engineer, who knew I am burst in it losing 30 pounds. You know what else does it work? What's that? Shutting up. Oh. So you're going to, you're going to say that if you go on there and talk about Hank and he's being as big as a house. What are you going to do? Nothing is going to work. It's going to work. Well, we're trying. And we're trying to do it out of love and kind of stuff because we want to make fun of somebody because there are fat people like Josh Schreedman. We've made fun of it. Now he's not here anymore. Oh, see that worked. Ha ha ha. Plus the fact that everybody hated him like poison. I wonder if he and Mo got along. I don't think so. That's a good question. To late now. Too late now because Josh Schreedman is departed. Some got some things changing around here. Oh, look at look at it. I just walked in with a hat on for just a second when the door put I thought I might have been the Humper coming in. But it's a shorter slimmer version of the Humper. It's old chicken egg. Carlos used that CD to microwave a piece of pizza pizza on and got cheese all melted on it. Is that a true story? Oh, but he lost. What a schmuck. What a put. Oh, you're talking about that. This guy was looking for number 25. I could have brought it back with me if somebody would have told me. It's got that new Mickey and I's new thing on it. He's lost one. That's when it had it. But he didn't lose it. I would look in his spectrum. Wouldn't be surprised if it's in there. He's just checking the slide. You're Brian. While you're here. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, no. He just opened his cheeks right out of Georgia's neck. Oh, my God. Look at that. I'm getting my knife. You can smell that baby right in here. Like I've seen from train spotting. I don't want to tell you which one. Don't ever talk about that movie anymore. Please. I'm not in the on a planet. Transpining. A bit of book of Brian never saw that. But I bet you book of Brian knows who he was and Jessica Tandy didn't use to make all him electronic product. Twelve minutes after one at five, 60 WDQM. How low can those interest rates go?

You're okay. We got better uses for the three billion dollars here all these unemployed bastards for all these veterans fixing pot holes at least That's right do something constructive with it Get somebody some health care. It's like dying over the can't afford their medication Tats that I hit over children in at least terrorists bastards over these lunatics and then one-room mother is still killing each other with our weapons A majority of people around the world view president bush unfavorably Absolutely And think the United States was wrong to invade Iraq according to a BBC poll published yesterday boys and girls The poll would surveyed more than 11,000 people in love and country showed 57% of those asked at a very unfavorable or fairly unfavorable attitude toward the American president They bushmeister the BBC said in the statement Some 56% felt he was was wrong to attack Iraq including 81% of Russian respondents and 62% of those bold and France In Jordan and Indonesia well over half those asked felt the United States pose the greater danger to world peace and stability than al Qaeda Did you hear that? In Jordan and Indonesia well over half of those asked felt the US pose the greater danger to world peace and stability than does al Qaeda In five of the 11 countries pulled on a majority response believe the United States was more dangerous than Iran Unnamed by Bush's part of an axis of evil with a rack in North Korea and eight out of the 11 respondents said the US was more dangerous than Syria a country which washed in accuses of sponsoring terrorism However attitude toward America rather than the Bush administration was slightly more positive half rated the country fairly while 40% considered it unfavorable So in other words, they're not that much against the US. They just hate bush. I guess they got a point Asked if their country was becoming more like America 81% of Australia and 64% of Britain said yes The server conducted may in June by the BBC and posters around the world covered Australia Brazil Britain Canada France Indonesia Israel Jordan South Korea Russia in the US It was commissioned for a TV program called what the world thinks of America and a two good right at them all. Thanks for your presidency. Thanks to this fascist pig 567.0560 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line look at our response man screenless Tuesday Began pleading on my hands and knees here WQAM Yes, I'd like to see what now speaking our first lady in two days. Hello. Hi, my name is Rory. I'm gone from what's home each excellent And I have two points that I'd like to make aside from the articles that you've been reading our all correct for the world is right My folks moved into a complex with a bunch of frogs And at first I came in with the such prejudices from living in Miami Beach and listening to you and They're all wonderful to my parents and they're nice and they're generous And they're not cheap my second point is they're not cheap I'm here the ones up here. They share lawnwork with my folks and they must not be akin to the ones that the French or the frogs that hang out in Hollywood Beach You know, they must not be related And also I have a real hard time because I love you and I love Randy and I have a hard time Guys can't get along. What do we know about that? Well, you always are making comments about her and it's so funny because you guys have The same I just went to a thing. I think it was yesterday where I talked about the fact that she's got big balls And she told her about green and told them where to stick it and I played the thing where she ripped into my green I don't know what you're talking about. Okay. Well, we can't get along Well from previous years and I guess I I didn't hear yesterday. I don't I don't know that we ever didn't get along I mean, I think Randy takes herself much too seriously and I'll I have no apology for saying that But I don't have a problem with her I just find a call and mention those two points and have a great day and you took the good work. Thank you Do we have a problem with Randy? Not that we know and I may be Randy more. We have a problem with because he's a clown. You know Oh, I see a thing in the paper the other day. Oh, on a pantherry our organization They're trying to be more fan friendly. I'll give you some instructions I've been trying to tell you this for a long time, but nobody over there listens to me You know they treat me very nice, but they don't listen If you want to be more fan friendly put a competitive team out there, okay? If you're gonna charge those kind of prices don't pound yourself on a chest like oh, we're not raising ticket prices Wow big deal big-sthinking deal for that kind of money to go see that kind of lack of entertainment And you wonder why people aren't showing up in a town where nobody cares about it And anyway in addition to which if you're gonna like put a team together It might be a good idea for the keep the players together for more like 10 minutes So somebody has an idea who the people are on the team. I mean look at me if you're stomach is strong Look at me, Mr. hockey expert and last I didn't know even a whole half these guys were Mizzai Mizzuzza Mizzraki, who the hell are these people? I don't know who they are All the players that we used to know and love the good ones I'm talking about they're all gone and they keep put a bunch of guy who are these people? Nobody knew who the hell these people were? So if you want to be a fan friendly put a competitive team out there But that don't seem to be the south Florida effinway no more except for the dolphins Now of course they got that salary kept thing going but the other teams are they just they know are they're not competitive So why can you moan and grown in bitch and belly ached and nobody shows up in addition? Which it's a horseball front running town anyway, but on top of that you put a crap team out there. It's like sealing your own fate like you're in team Nobody ain't gonna show up 26 past one at five 60 WKM. We got the gym the mad dog Manage I guarantee a mad dog really wants Brian Grisci to be the he won't say it. I don't want to put words in his mouth. I just had that feeling You know I Just have a feeling that Mr. Mad dog wants Brian Grisci to be the dolphin steering quarter. Am I right about that? Yeah, see there's been a boy not in this area and I'm with him I mean if I were dolphin fan which I'm not I'm a patriot fan and very proud of it But if I wanted to see the dolphin's have a big season Brian Grisci. I mean he might make a big comeback We yeah, we had a couple pretty damn good years They didn't pay a lot of million dollars because of the way he looks You're a T of that and Shea feedlets out that we don't like Jay's a good Jewish boy.
