Now, now his ego is still humongous Absolutely That's the reason he was rip and Tom Brenman Of course, he used to work with Harry Carey on a Cub games Back in the late 80s early 90s And so Tom Brenman Obviously he's got a little bit of a bias And there but the fact that it matter is that When he said that we're 19 out select for the Cub to go to the World Series There was nothing outrageous about that That the Cub's were ahead of looked like they had the game in hand It's this whole thing about the Cub's in 95 years of history And idea that was nothing inappropriate about that And he just was slicing him at ass this morning When I came in here at 715 and turned it on Oh, it's just on an national telecard You know, even though I don't I don't not cover broadcast Well, that's a bunch of bloodcraft Because I've heard him rip Johnny most He was probably the best basketball announcer ever I've heard him are Marvelle Ber because he's jealous His hell of a him who now he's doing what he had in football Took his gig And he lies to his seat Well, I almost never rip other sportsguards It will crap They had you don't It's just a big, pompous bag of wind is all you are Mo Who is she's that you were sitting there would really feel the night Doing to them Marlon the Cub game That's what you wish You silly ass goose and by the way Which Taylor is it that's got the ball there on the dolphin game on Jacksonville Taylor, huh? Andy Taylor.

He said interview would see in last year This is Terry's wish. It's not anybody else's wish. It's her wish God damn it So there you go This business of trying to force people to stay alive Just enough to make you want to puk Although Sheridan's doing pretty well on passions right Scott Yeah He's not speaking no more Scott. He's just planned up totally in Ocean Oh, that's something's bugative What is it? I think something's bothering him. What is that? What is it? It's God's share with us Pete What is that? I'm the one who's eating it. I think he's having a financial crisis Oh financial. Oh, wow You know, I hate to brag. I don't want to break the bad news to you But your predecessor had a financial crisis too all every day Well, he has a financial crisis. He had a health crisis He sees every single day It's like every day he had a whole bunch of about Third man Don't see him no more. In fact, we have sent a search party I can't even find him no more Remember, he had a no more. Well, I think that's the deal So, but you have to just a little bit Scott Don't bring your problems to work just because you couldn't afford to go to Starbucks this morning Get a coffee late today or whatever it is Don't start to, you know, cop on an attitude with us Because you'll be out there before you can say Grant took Richmond Can you say it?

Maybe that's the deal Well, what what day is it? It's the 15th. I mean, pay day isn't like any time Or like 10 days away. Yeah. So if he's having like a little bit of a financial crisis, why don't you help him out? I mean, his girlfriend for help would help him out, but he probably hasn't got paid yet either He's only been there a few months Why don't you help him out, George? You always did for your other little buddy there I mean, just because he don't speak in a wrong language and I got a story on that too By the way, Dad ordered to speak English in Nebraska. You love that story. All right. I'm not liquid. No comment. Here's the poll today before we get to the rest of the bush poll, which I'm really thrilled I'm squeezing it a little bit. Maybe that's why I'm a little gassy today I've been squeezing it so hard. What is or was the greatest radio station in the history of South Florida? Now I didn't list them all. That would be just stupid. But here's the short list. Oh, I guess we should have had Wild. Sorry. Sorry, Mr. Why not? What? No, no, I'm saying we should have had it on there. We just, Wild.

WFUN, long gone, but man, WFUN, WMHJ, WINZ. All used to be a great station, man. Once upon a time, before the Chief Channel people came in there and destroyed it. Patients started the death and then they finished it off. They took away the life support. They pulled out the tube. W1Z and WWW. That's my short list. Of course there's other stations that have come and gone. I can never think of that. 102.7. What it used to be before became that the hard row was in. And heavy metal station. Don't know. Yeah, you do. We've been through this, uh, a Zidian times. Well, I can't remember either. Ah, and back in those days, for some reason, I had a really crappy signal too.

I'm somebody's fastest in the bus WBUS. You're everything good guy doesn't know. We're you getting out of here, Homer. So anyway, yes. I just got a call from America. I hope we're not going to be adding a whole lot of things today because boy, he sounded dead. Everyone is sick. Remember? Yeah. I feel pretty good. So for my game. Well, both get a good breed done me. I have SARS now. You know. Yeah. He could barely talk. Well, let me ask you a question. What is putting a few station colleges on the website? I'd have to do with being because I noticed when he's got what is or was. He changed that like with the matter of moment. Uh huh. So quit making excuses for fat airic up there. You can have a little chicken soup as wife can pat him on ahead if you can find it. And he can put this stuff. I'm about what did he say? He said, don't give me a bunch of stuff. Now what we're only doing the one poll. All of how wanted to be a real prick. I could say, well, this is just the first hour poll. And we're going to do a different poll each hour, even during the one to two comedy bits hour. If you want to really push me. Don't push me. Do you see what I'm saying? Uh huh. I'm not sparse down to the current circumstances. Don't be making excuses for the inexcusable one. All right. He's got a lot of lost time to make up for like the three years that he was just sitting resting on his laurels on his big fat laurels. Got it? Oh yeah. Yeah, if anybody should know you. So so what was the bulletin there with what? Well, how many are they going to be? How many stations you think about? 30 minutes. I'm going to say, W. B. U. S. We'll put the he doesn't have to add them right away. I mean, once we get the list of biology, put them on there, all right? Okay. She's everything is like so out of sync lately. It's not a link. Just when we thought everything was going great. And now all of a sudden, but the book for my whole places like coming on glue because you know, just like just like Jack Nicholson said, you can't handle the truth. Only in this case, that you can't handle success, Greg. You can't handle success. The suck part, maybe but not the rest. You can't deal with it. So you have to keep diddling and diddling and poking and probing and squashing and breaking and cracking and then he's running around. Or with his little award, his little piece of direct there from the Beesleys. That in 40 cents, so by about a third of a cup of coffee and Rascal has our wrestling thark is there. How can a chondic to old Jews? Now you're done to make him excuses for Eric? Yes, sir. We got to one guy there that's not talking to his unstriped because he's got some kind of financial problem. What was what he was talking about? What? I was just making stuff up. Oh, well then what's his deal today? I don't know. Ask him. Ask him. That's going to be real productive. Poll show is bush slipping. The ABC news poll just out. Persistent criticism on the economy and his Iraq policy like our clouding president Bush's political standing, creating vulnerabilities that combine to lock the incumbent up on an unnamed Democrat a dead heat for the race 2004. In fact, he's actually trailing now. Oh, bush against the generic Democratic candidate for the next year's election. On September 13, it was 49% for bush 44% of the Democrat, whoever it might be generic. Now as of October 13, which is just two days ago, 46% vote for bush 47% for any generic Democrat. Just about anybody, anybody who went him. Even better than that for those of us who want bush out. Oot. Among registered voters, it's even worse for the bush monster. He's got 44% to 49% for the generic Democrat. Among registered voters. Ready for that? I'm ready. Now I'm ready for it. Let's have the election right now. Oh. Sure that Arnold of thing or two. And among the Democrats who are leaning kind of like the leaning tower pizza. The ones who are like listing, leaning. Today, 17% for Howard Dean. Alright. That's my man Howard Dean. No BS. No Johnny come lately Democrat. No, well, I'm for it on against it. He's been right on. He's had the balls right all along. Howard Dean 17. Dick Edwards got 13. 13% like Dick. 12% Wesley Clark. They want to feed him some good kishka. John Kerry who I still said. John Kerry at least would look good on Mount Rushmore, wouldn't he? Sure they got room. No, no, I'm sure she's got that craggy face. In fact, he looks like they've already carved him from out Rushmore, if he asked me. John Kerry looks a little scary. He's got 10. Two lever Ben dropped from 22% last time to 9%. In a month, he dropped from 22 to 9. Carol mostly bronze got six. Carol mostly bronze. Brown. Al Sharpton four. John Edwards in between psychic readings. He's running. He's got three. And Dennis Cassinit who made it officially. He's whether he has to. He has to. He's if we didn't already know who says a lot of great things. He's a good guy, but nobody likes his herpes. Dennis Cassinit. Nobody has any idea who is plus he's too short George. He's got two. Two percent. Look at that. We just got the Pompano Park copy. I was going Troy you to man man. You do you to me man. Bald headed Troy. And that quite an accomplishment. One of our salespeople to get us. Are those are copy? That's pretty damn impressive if you ask me. Okay, let's get back to the app. Because I got like a whole pile of stuff here today. And we got Scott is there. Pouting Eric, you make a big sues of Eric. Why can't put anymore stations on the pole? I'm surprised he's conscious. Why is that? Just the way he sounded. Just in general. Making gargling sounds. Oh good. Believe me. That's you should probably agree with me. That's probably his best communication with us. What is or was the greatest radio station in this view? Sound floor. We got 50 votes on there already. Just to get and go this thing going. A lot of other stations to be put on there. I'm sure. And you notice he's already got WBS on. I said he could wait. See, I don't know. This is the old deal again. It's just part of your love hate relationship which is all hate. And that is no matter what you say, he's going to do the opposite just to be contrary to make you look like a jackass. Okay. Apparently. No, seriously. That's what he's going to do. That's why he's putting stuff on there even faster than usual. Just to say, hey, don't be making excuses for me, George. Just because I'm dying over here. You'll surely have fast-packing whip it out. 50 votes. WSHT is running away with 20. And that's no surprise to me. Now, who was it that screwed that station up? That was a passion. Yes, it was. That was the party that we got the money that we made it into a planet. They should be kicked off the planet for screwing with she. I mean, there was a rock solid if you pardon that pun. A rock solid station right there. 103.5. And it took it. They made it into a girl East station. What was the call? I don't know. WPLL or some crap like that. A stupid set out of all the way. And they made it something even more stupid than that. What that was it now? 103.5. What is it? What's the call? What's the call? I don't even know. We don't even know. That's how far they followed a mighty a fallen man. Oh, really? What was this thing? And we've been never told my other host that the series was no. Everybody knew me for your wife. The X factor. The lowest part of the murder. What is this? I don't know about the reports. Why didn't you send that to me? Why did you forward them? I think you're the one that's off your feed. You just don't know what you had. Lady. It just hasn't hit you. It's way too late. Until Gassy to Wonder Dog attacks. 560560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Look at that. They're showing a game again last night that eighth inning. Nice gone boys. I watched the entire game, which I realize I'm not jumping on a bad wagon. I'm not claiming to be a Marlin fan. I'm not trying to like siphon off a little of the excitement. If they win the night and then go under the world series. I'm not trying to do that. But I think it's pretty exciting. Even George. I've seen that play over and over a whole bunch of times. But third man. Then you know there must be something there to stick your thumb on. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. This is for 20560. You wait. Who they have. Oh, my cow. Neil Rogers is right. The cubs suck. If those calls make you insane. I feel your time because you've made that. Just say that. But be honest. If those calls make you insane. I feel your time because you've made that. Just say this. Yeah. But be honest. Tell them what good dirt should have no power. To call you 507 times an hour. And the shower. If you wanted all the end. Let's get fun. Call your friends. You must insist. Yeah. But be honest. What do you want? What do people have to do to have any solitude? Phone keeps ringing on the hood. With some vinyl sighting crum. Charge cards replacement. Those sold by dropout symbols. Get you pee a crime. Two tie up my phone line. Now this thing is going to court. But these slime vows are the sort. Who can't resist? Call an abolist. You get me sent quiet in your kitchen. It will take a Supreme Court decision. Big decision. Because they're lawyers files. Now it's gone. Be up in just a sprint quest. Absolutely. To put me on the list. Put me on the list. Put me on the list. 1046 at 560 WMRless 91 votes. So far was the is or was the greatest radio. Station. Soundform. The greatest. The best. WSHC 35. She's only rock and roll. And she ate their normal. Because between passion and cheap channel. They uh, if they're over ran. They screwed everybody. Wild 22 once upon a time boy. Those were the days. And of course they had to. I don't know about an ancient history. But they had the great entertainers. Wasn't that it? Yeah. That was it. The great entertainers in the uh. Reneri Big Wilson bill called her Larry King era. Then they went through a real floundering with Bill Smith and Sandy Peyton and Ed Drek. And then of course there was the our era. The golden era. First with Reneri and then with Rick and Suds in a morning and yours truly and Phil Henry and the goddess. Oh, those were the days. 22 for Wild. W2QAM only 15 even with all those great. A rock here is the rookie ticky and the all those uh, the other dead people. And now of course, but it's still even with our station only 15. What does that tell you Greg? They're not as easily impressed as the beeslaze Greg. We're not getting no award from the audience. Zeta WCTA 7 WVUS 5 the magic bus. You don't remember that. Do you know. No. Bob Gordon was one of Bob Gordon. Bob Martin was once on the magic bus. Who is I think he must be dead Bob Martin and his daughter used to be on Craig Warthing's trivia panel with Mike Spindell and all these other angels see go all these other losers.

Nobody's going to remember that. I'll put it down. WMYQ was the precursor of the predecessor to Y100. It was the first FM rock station in the market. I do believe the Casper put that on along with seasonal have tell. WMQ. I think that's the one or lost their license because of the only contest. Hey Greg, they lost their license because of the county contest. You might want to tell the chief channel people that. Well look at this. Here's the thing for tomorrow's event. Well that's nice. It's a little bit ahead of time. I'll love believe when I see it. And also just like I believe that check for the other 335 bucks is coming in. Or we'll get a new total from Miguel sometime. Anything. That's part of any part of that. Well here it is. I just got it. See? Well we need 31,925. All we need now is 75 bucks. I bet you he is excited to go about it.

W's CKO and parenthesis will put K102. That's when I was trying to take out. That was Burtude and transformed into magic 102.7. W's CKO, K102. W's, STH always played the old crap that was boring. Even when Joey and Charlie Kendall were there. They were lucky to get a 2.0. Oh, kind of like mode. 2.0. Rimes with Mo. Anything else in it? Oh. Like one point. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the old man is going to pull a big number out of his eyes tomorrow. What do you think? Yeah. He'll probably roll it around in his fingers. He'll pull something out. He'll pull a big number out of his eyes. Wouldn't be the first time for what everybody tells us all the eyewitness reports. Okay. Let's get a bunch of stations on this list and quit dittling around.

Reagan Yes, his name that's his name County judge Ronald E. Reagan said the child doesn't understand Spanish, and her father should speak to her in the language she be no one E. Lloyd Amador who was released from jail seven months ago after serving a five-year sentence for drug possession told the judge Had he spoke Spanish to the girl to share his culture not to force a language honor I don't come to her speaking in Spanish, but there are times when I try to teach her what her hair isn't Spanish What hand is stuff like that? Amador said during a September 15 hearing on visitation The judge didn't oppose such instruction, but said the rest of the communication should be in English for the sake of the girl's education The principal former communication during the periods of visitation is going to be English Reagan said this doesn't mean that you can instruct and teach you the Hispanic language Okay the Hispanic language the Hispanic language speak Okay Father's no log not Spanish, but the Hispanic language they come in you know all your spirits have that same you know Hey get us all you nuts The ruling's a victim of the girls mother micaela crane, neski Aha, polah Who requested the emidor speaking mr. initiative hesitation.

No, say Abheng, Laisaki, no say Abheng, Laisaki. Okay, now somebody says WCKR and Wacker 2 twist. Yeah, we remember that, are we gonna put that on there? Oh, you've got that, there's somewhere the Wacker twist. I'm sure it's not in here. Is it? I don't know. Oh, no, it's not in here, like I said, I'm sure. Now somebody gives us a radio, a South Florida radio lesson. It says first, it says where's Mitch Ween and Roy. I don't know. Hello, I'm sure Mitch is still with Big Sons people, right? That's where I'm going to be. Who? Fix it. Fix it one. Fix it this. Jim, you said, sent this fast to me? Yes. Why? Because you're talking about radio. Well, I think he's wrong. Wild was WCKR and then became Wild again. WMYQ 96.3 contest fraud became WPPW96.5. They lost the license and MQ WOC and plays to be of a kind. I have no idea what that's supposed to mean. WA1A, which is AI, AI, the colors, but was WA1A your music way with Alan Anderson. Remember Alan Anderson, one of the most, one of those boring IOD people. Oh, they went through a really boring period, you know? Yeah. I'm serious. That was like the Bill Smith era in Sandy Payton. Just boring. Alan Anderson. I think, uh, fixed it as wrong. It says became WGTR and then the coast. I don't think so. I could be wrong, but I think A1A was what was, uh, we used to be Waxi, uh, FM. Was it in it? I'm not sure. I'm pretty sure. What's the frequency? 105.9, which is now big. I think it was that was A1A, your music music way. And then it became Waxi FM. And then Greg, but that was on air for about 10 minutes. And of course, we don't want to forget Greg's good buddy. It's a good time for the great team. He might be right because I have a candy deal. This is noodles reminding you that it's always a good time for the great taste. Don't just step on rules. Good. What is that in fall? Now what do you, he might be right? Yeah, because I have a, like a candy dish that I got at WIOD that they had in an old closet and it had WA1A and WIOD. Like from when they were both in the same building. Yeah. So in other words, because Cox, uh, on the stage now, if you can see that guarantees the, Oh, no, he's right. He should know. He ought to know and he's, and then, you know, he knows this crap that fix it. Anything that we need to put on here about one. Stations that we missed that we don't know. I need to follow. I'll see what he's got on there right now. Okay. Oh, man, if I got the old gas up the throat ass. No, not the ass. Thank goodness. Bad for your roids. Bad for your roids. Uh, I think he's got it all right up to the minute up to the second. W-A-I-A is he got that A1A? That's what we need to put on there. W-A-I-A. Got it? Got it. Now you interrupted me in a very pro. Oh, yeah. How about the 75 bucks? How's that coming? Adam is going to give it to us. How about the money? That too. Oh. Adam from sales is giving us 75 bucks. That's your for Adam, okay? He's a little bit of a thing, bad. He's a little eat-as-bunker. He's a good guy. He means well. He never stole a freight train. He wants to know why it's a copy that there's only two of them. Thanks, Adam. You're the best man. He's the only one in sales he's more talking about. I'm always been that way. At least it's consistent, right? Well, choice a good guy. No, no. Troy is a slacker. Troy puts on the air of being a good guy. But when it comes to like servicing as it comes, like Brandies is coming up. We have the new tag for Brandies yet. No. I have no idea what it's supposed to be. Let me take a look at the log and see when that spot is coming. I believe it. Yeah. Do we have the new tag for Brandies? No. It's already Wednesday. It's the middle of the week. So I know he's going to be letting me down there again. I had a scream at how I just to get the pop-in-o copy. So don't be giving me a song that has about Troy. He puts on a nice swath, smooth act. He's got a smooth swath, bald spot on his head. But other than that, he's just one of them. You know? No, I don't believe it. He had my sympathy. Well, for Robert is bad back. But then again, Rush had a bad back, too. And now that Troy's got Will must phone number. He gave me a lot better. I mean, I'll get a some copy this week. Sure. I'll get something. Here's a call from Chicago, supposedly. Hello. Hey, Neil, are you doing? Okay, sorry about that. Sorry about that. You think I'm surprised. You would think like everyone wants to kill the guy. Yeah. But like I haven't met anyone. I mean, I'm talking on the train to people in the way to work this morning. Everyone's like, oh, yeah, it was stupid. But the club just flat blue it. But like the way you want to in the news, it's like, you know, we're off. Oh, man. I don't know what he got a lynch mob going on. They want to find a son of a bitch. They want to kill our right there on TV on WGN. Now, if the club's loose tonight, yes. I believe there will be a lynch. I mean, oh, I think, I mean, I don't know. I just, I think, you know, it's like, well, okay, they can still do it tonight. You know, well, I think if they can't find the guy, they might go after Dusty Baker. Well, how many times did he say fan interference last night? And he had post game interview here that night in here that night. All right. But you know what he was right. I did it. And last time I watched it, I didn't notice it was fan interference. They blew the call. No, I'm no one else to talk about that, though. But they didn't make the error. A short stop. The empires now, so they can give up all those. It's not. It's so that we don't have to be on the ground for the play. He's not going to throw it anybody. Right. You know, and I guess the security guards were running that guy around the stadium trying to sneak him out of next. Yeah, they showed it on CNN. Oh, they can't find it. The cameras kept finding him in the crowd. Kip figuring out who he was. Right. So like, they gave him a jacket. And he put it over his head. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. Put a jacket over guys that, hey, I wonder who they're hiding. Well, listen. If the morons were to hide, let us know what time the execution is going to be tomorrow. We'll put it on the ear. Hey, I'll pick pictures for you. Put on the website. Thanks, Pally. Love you, guys. See you. Here's a list of your goggles. Listen on the internet right now on eorogers.com who says they're going to kill a son of a bitch. So not feeling too bad right now, but if they do lose tonight, then then he will fear them. You want them all? This is for 20 or 20. Do we? Yeah. Vampire, this golden gasser. Wonderful. Double you, cute lady. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'm 46. I got a new poll for tomorrow. I'm not going to do that one about the comedians. I'm going to do different one. I'm inspired by a facts from our best facts. Maybe not our best. One of our good facts is jury from the leaders brings. Yeah. Don't apologize. You're he. I apologize. This is perfection today. I'm going to go down with a lot of boring stuff about how we grew up in Pennsylvania, North West and Pennsylvania, and they picked up two stations during the daytime, WPME and Punx and Tony, and every time he turned it on he used to see his shadow. And Katie K. in Pittsburgh, home of Clark Weber, and Bob Prince in a Pirates, and Art and Wendy King. Well, she used to be on Katie K. Jack Wheeler. Wow. What a memory. How would I mind? What a messy mind. No, she has a messed up with crap. It's, frankly, says the Katie K. A. D. J. after school was Clark race. I don't think so. Is that Clark race? Does anyone know you stand the race riots in Pittsburgh? And that we used to listen to WBZ, WLSW ABC and WKBWW. Absolutely correct. Which is radio can never be the same again. And he goes on about the days of President Bruce Moro who's an assholes. Jerry Reynolds and other asshole. And Dick Bionney are gone. Maybe not so bad about your Reynolds, but he was good in this time. Well, my favorite DJ had to be Dick Bionney and WLS. Did I just play a little bit of Dick a little while ago? Yeah. Did the beginning of that bullpen Jack segment? Which I have a lot more of and later. And so anyway, he inspired me for the pull for tomorrow. So you have better not say it now because now they'll start calling it with suggestions which we don't want. Who is or was your favorite radio district? He knocked out your host of all time. We never did that. No, we have it. No. Because we have people from all over the country. We even have people listening like his last guy in Chicago. From all over the country. Right? Right? I made a sure I better not say it. I don't want to do that now and I probably should have done that bad move. So anyway, we've got to 32 grand thanks to Adam and sales. Who's a good guy. 75 bucks. That'll probably have to miss a few meals. You know. But nevertheless, we are thanking profusely because the rest of you people in that station man. We can't count on you guys. Cheat. Cheat. Cheat. Cheat. Cheat. Really cheap. Bad. We got a real contest going on on this poll though. Well, what is there was the greatest radio station in history of South Florida? WSAG. She is still in lead but it's got some stiff competition. She 93 Wild 88. QAM 44. Uh-huh. Hey, take your trophy and stuff and Greg 44 on our own station. WCKO K10213. See what I want to tell you. They liked it. Zeta WZT812. WHYI 111. Bus. The bus. 10. Didn't that shock you? WVUS? I wouldn't know. By the way, Bob Martin used to be on air. I think Alphi was on air too. Do you remember Alphi? No. What's it all about? No, Mickey had things good buddy and the Craigworthy Alphi used to be on K22 just before I went there. That was going a long time. Alphi. He was I think he must be dead. I think Alphi was a closet kind of a, I mean, this talking. Uh, well, let's see. Bus has got 111, 111. WFU and funds got seven. You got some old WFU and Jingles there somewhere. WGTR6. Magic Scott 3. INZ AM3. Uh, oh, I must have been for Stan Major. Would you think? Must be. WEDR 99. Jam is 3. WTMI2. Excuse us. Uh, log 94 or two. So, jazz freaks, WSR of surf too. Probably Jack Mark is one of them. WHQT, how 1051? The fact that Keith Isley was the program director of how 1051, I believe before he came to I-95, the old how 105. Which was slightly similar, somewhat different format. WACFM1, that's because they don't like Greg Buda. Rick and such used to be on WACFM, right? Yes, they did. And Ricky Tiki show whom they hated like poison. It's called him a Nazi stuff like that. And no votes none for RMF, I-95. Roll the produce to be on I-95. He could tell you all about it. Are we trying to roll the parole as he still a kiss? I think so. Good man. W-R-B-D don't have none. W-K-T don't have none. W-C-K-R none, which we'd do one on their first place. And W-A-I-A-W-A-1-A, your music way. Do you remember that? Sure. Had none. 3009 votes. For your favorite self-order radio station of all time. No, not your favorite, the best. See, they're the little votes for their favorite. 5-670560, pound-560 on the AT&T line. Here's Del Ray B, Chelo. Daniel. Yes sir. You're missing the country giant W-K-T-M-A. What is it? W-G-M-A, Jerry Wichner did the daytime country music. G-N-A, and N-S-N-N-C. Girl Mike. Oh, M-A, W-G-M-A, that was in Hollywood, right? Right, that's right. Jerry Wichner was on there. You know, also with the surfing she thing. Remember surf, I mean, she was quadraphonic for a while. Really? Transmitting and quad, yeah, at four separate channels. Obviously, instead of getting your quadraphonic speakers. And then A-M, they tried to do A-M stereo on surf. That was like the big thing. It never went through. Well, the only problem was, because they were like 1,800 on the dial. You get one channel on the other one was like, off the edge of your radio dial. That's having good. Yeah, surf was actually about 1580 I think it was. No, I think it was, was it 1580 or 5090? Hmm, I don't know. Somewhere up there. But now it's expanded the A-M band, right? So it goes up like 17 something I guess. Yeah, it sure helped the the fandom it. Yeah, it's been your right. Fifteen 80. I just looked it up on the net, right? Yeah, I was looking for a new WSR of 1584 Loderdale. Mystic 1580's format is tailored for some of the perverse community. Mystic, so they changed the format again. That's great. That'll help. That's lame. And now remember WRVD was actually downstairs at K102. And the same building off a rock island road. That'll be damned. They were coming from the same place. The actual site was right there. I worked at K102 part time. And that was the end of FM radio was when they brought in consultant. How come they a signal was so bad though? That was the reason that K102 really had a problem. They couldn't compete with sheikers or signal suck. And then whoever when they bought changed it to a magic, right, peed on the tower is something. I think sunny fox cappin on the tower every day. Yeah, the guys that owned it originally were not really New the people already, old people. And they sold it to another group of lawyers with something like that. But the cool thing about one or two reason why people like it was is the DJs were actually given the freedom to play the hit record off the album. So two outwrector's deep into the hour and make your own choice. And that was like a big deal back then. You know, somebody was actually playing something that wasn't, you know, the consultant's weren't telling them exactly what's the play. I'll be doing a little bit of radio. Thanks for the history man. Have a great day. Bye. How about really be he was playing with stuff that they consultants never told me to play? That's 15. 560560 pound 560 he was on I. 95 with Earl DePurrol and Don Cox. Hey, listen to this. What's that 75 dollar check from out of a rye? I mean, we had another one. No. Thanks Adam, you're the best. Well, you're okay. Of course you don't have much to beat and that's how it's department. No, seriously, I appreciate that very nice and nice. So just you know, if somebody else in your gives a crap, they all pretend they, you know, they left their checkbook at home. They didn't hear me. They don't give a crap about a band and pair rescue. They don't care about us. Well, you know, we'll see what those numbers come out tomorrow. Whether they're any good or not, you know? That may be don't care about us, and then maybe they won't. And then maybe they won't care about low normal. Absolutely. Well, I can't wait for those hour by hour. What I'm on vacation, I'm going to be like, we're going to have to put those on our websites. So I can see him. Okay. I'll thank you. I want to see them on our website. You got it. Here's a call from Miami. Buenos dias. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It stands on its own. Here's Miami, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I can't believe these are e-cub fans are coming up with the lame excuse that this poor fellow cost from that game that night. The poor fellow. You mean the asshole that reached out on the plane? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to see a world for you. I'm going to see a lot of way from here. I can't come up with a better excuse. I'll end the excuse with this poor kid call from the game that's like, give me a mic. Why do you keep saying this poor kid is an idiot? Neil. If there would have been some kid there in a PP park and then it's in a Marlins, you'd be screaming bloody murder right now. There'd be a lynch mob. The cops. Yeah, and you need the first one online man. You'd have a machete right in your hand right now. Or you can be, sir. Call one of the sports shows and spew that crap. Okay. I mean, I'm glad to see the Marlins are doing good because like I said, I'm not a fan, but it's good for the town. We need something. Sure. Something to hop on a bandwagon. Something over the other side of it. Something positive. The panther. The undefeated panther is they scott all of a sudden. No, you see. So hockey intensive. Right. The win against me. Hockey in two things happens. Scott pipes up and the ice comes out. That's the idea, isn't it? You're in tea. Yeah, that is the idea. You can quiet. Atlanta trashers man. They're undefeated. I guess in honor of Dan Snyder's memory and also Danny Heatley, who are they seeing now? Don't look like he's going to go to the slamer. I'm going to happen to him because what would it accomplish? I guess what it would accomplish is keeping him from doing it again probably. Isn't that what generally a part of the idea is supposed to be? But nevertheless, he's a jock. All of the sudden good stuff. He showed up at the funeral and my wrong Ontario and everybody was like, you know, doing her thing. Look at that. She and I would either only five votes apart. Say life and death battle. Don't forget we got our gigantic one and two. What's that schedule? They haven't even get a schedule. It's a clip from the collector. Don't leave her for granted. A few bucks for this. It's kind of easy about it. açseomanelipswar antenna... Vince I'm going to add more hot- lows here though. Those would not even. We can also add that. They do, if I want me to just like boog-doodle the whole game, then that sounds like a winner. I can't go do the game. We'll get some people tuning in. We got the Panther game against the, uh, the penis coyotes. That'll be on AM Waxy 790 because we got a farm it out because the Marlon's take precedence. Plus, of course, the Marlon game really means something. The Panther game, small potatoes.

Well, I would have sworn it was 1610. But now it's 1580. When you have thought it was like 16 something, well, I could have sworn. But don't. But I'm sure you're right. Well, I am right now because I looked it up. In fact, you can look up anything. I was just looking, uh, well, I get to the other faction. Mark chronic packs. Uh, it says hi. The state was in debut across from Howard Junior College back in the of the trailer park. I was going to BJC at the time learning how to fly airplanes. And we'd go over and beg for concert tickets for Pirates World. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Remember those days? No. Oh, I do. Here's a chronic fact. To the best station here, this is the one that gets up on a wrong side of better renowned in this fact. The best station here played oldies. Sons magic never plays. Loseway to radio AM980 98 gold. Do we have any idea what the call it is where? Nope. Well, let's just put 98 gold, okay. Okay. And now this really peaked my curiosity because I think that fix it was wrong again. 96 x. That's the station that lost its license. Okay. Then the call it is, we're WCJX. You can put WCJX and parenthesis 96 x. Uh, that's the station. I'm positive. They're lost at license. But what do I know? 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. I did get those stories that I teach yesterday. You probably thought I forgot about it. Naner, naner, naner. Pizza livery driver, fine for spitting in salad. That was one of those that you were just right on the edge of your suit. Waiting here the outcome. A German pizza livery driver has been firing 270 pounds for spitting in a customer salad. That's about 500 bucks. Stephen, a step on a wincler. Tell us a lie about that could have been a rope or a ah. He filed formal charges and had a DNA sample taken from the goofball to spit on a salad. A test of all employees showed at the restaurant showed that 30 T-Roll Kiyawa H did not use in his last name. It spit into the salad. I had a coughing fit and forgot to throw the salad after where he came to work. But the judge, that's just like when the T-Roll had fair was on my show on K-T 100 years ago. Talking about how he and other black people working in the kitchen and restaurant back in those days used to spit in the soup to get even with the white with the whitey. It's like that old. Now he used to tell us that all the time. He was a spitter. Anyway, the judge decided not to believe the statement. Build newspaper reports. They said that the guy was probably angry because he had to go back to the restaurant again after forgetting the salad at the first delivery. Why? Oh, it happens all the time. Really? So they forget to bring you something. So you call them and say, hey, you forgot my fill in the blank. The pissed off delivery guy brings it to you, but you really want it. Well, I'll be damned. Yeah. So he was pissed off and fired up so he had given the old spitter. Here's another one I like from Anna Novod. That's a British paper. It's always got a lot of cuties in it. What was the one we had yesterday? I forget. Smelly feet man tonight access the library may start new life in Germany. A Dutch man, or I can believe that. It's probably from them wooden shoes. A Dutch man says he may move to Germany if he's convicted of disturbing the piece with his smelly feet. The man prefers to walk around without a shoes on without a shoes on, but provoked complaints in a university library. Tune this tune. Refused to put his shoes back on or stuff as it in the library adult university, and with charge of disturbing the piece, the 40 year old caused further up, so when he took a shoes off in court at the hay. Oh man, they were swooning. Mr. Tune made an official complaint. Oh, Mr. Tune, maybe he was cruning and they were swooning. Mr. Tune made an official complaint when a judge ordered him to put his shoes back on. His complaint was overruled. I guess he thought he was in the Japanese restaurant. His complaint was overruled by panel of three judges, and he now believes he'll lose his case. He told Al-Gimin, Doug Blod, journalist, Mark Kuzwek, that he wasn't aware that his feet smelled. SMLE-E-L-T, smelled. Then Brits, what a sense of humor how this feet smelled. They feel wet even when I put on dry socks, the only way to keep them dry as to air them. He said, when this trial is over, I will seriously think of leaving for Germany, there they don't mind a man walking about in this stock. I guess as long as he's goose step in right, right. Mr. Christwike reported that he had a hold as nose during the interview, and compared the smell to a bag of rotten potatoes that he kept in a cupboard for two weeks. I love that, what a great story. I mean, there's Dutch indigermans that hate each other like poison. Here's the gospel of the court of the Simpsons. Another great antanobastory. A Scottish church is to run a course on the gospel of the Simpsons to try to boost congregations. Two-story church leaders at Holburn-West Church in Aberdeen say the adventures of Holburn and his family are an idea way to explore moral and religious dilemmas. And I think they got a good point. What better way to explore moral and religious dilemmas than to be looking into Holmo and his family? And yet when the judge came at me. Right. Early, each of the four meetings will cover a different episode of the group discussion of the main teams taking place thereafter. The Reverend George Cowey. He prefers a company of men. Who doesn't? Spokesman for the Presbyterian Aberdeen said despite its an archic humor, the Simpsons is one of the few TV programs which portrays a modern family who attend church regularly. In fact, they're probably the last ones. The Reverend Cowey. FINEING! The course of Holburn-West will endeavor to close the gap with pop at her culture and is open to anyone who wishes to learn more about the Christian faith. How do you like that? Or...

Get you out of your deep funk. I'm likely. What are you so depressed about? Give us a hint. Do you have to tell us it's probably something personal like your XYF to run off with your lunch. What? Oh, no, no. Is that what I sound like you hit a hit on the ground? Yeah. Why I knew it. What else? Our guy like him. What else could get him this deep press beside his XYF? You know, they're all bitches. We all know that. Every XYF is a bitch. At least into mind of the X husband. And so it's got to be something with his XYF. Did something really nasty and mean spirit in his hostile and bad on shape. And a lot of hostility. Leave my XYF proof. See, out of this. There's only one way to solve the problem, okay? I don't think it's on the inside. Robert Blake can probably give you some good pointers. Anyway, listen to this is sex necessary. The benefit certainly seemed outweigh the risks. Ha ha ha. I'd be like that. And it says this is from ABC News. Not some copypink or leftist sex promoting organization of perverts. Fans of Athens had better be sitting down. It says sitting down. Good. Saving yourself before the big game, the big business deal, the big hold down. Maybe you guys just hop it on the big hole. Or the big bakeoff may indeed cause a morel benefit, but corporally, corporally, what kind of a word is that? Corp. Corp. Is that such a word? Yes. It does absolutely zippity doodah. There's no evidence that sharpens your competitive age. So now that we've got the big game coming up, screw your brains up. Have a good time. Work. The best of modern science can say for social absence is that it's harmless when practiced in moderation, having regular and enthusiastic sex by contrast, can for as a host of measurable physiological advantages, be you male or female, assuming you're engaging in sex without contracting a special transmitting disease, you'll be a little bit distressing. And one of those credible studies correlating over a health with sexual frequency, Queens, University and Belphas Northern Ireland, probably several Queens there, track the morality of about a thousand middle-aged man over the course of a decade. The study was designed to compare persons of comparable circumstances, age and health. It's findings published in 1997 in the British Medical Journal that men who reported the high frequency of orgasm enjoyed a death rate, half that of the laggards. Oh my god, better let's get busy. Squirt score here that. See you. No that's the most important thing I think we've ever said in this program. Come out of here. Let me read that sentence again published in 1997 that six years ago. Can you imagine that while that course George had one too many they're ones, but that's another story. What's? I was telling somebody about that story yesterday. In 1990, and about your phone call, 1997 in the British Medical Journal, men who reported the highest frequency of orgasm enjoyed a death rate, half of that of laggards. So when and out, squirt score. Whip it out. Squirt score. Whirk it squirt score. Squirt score. Squirt score. Whirk it squirt score. Pump it. Squirt score. Other studies, some rigorous, some less so. I'll let them leave my rigorous. Ports to show that having sex even a few times week has an associative or casual relationship with the following. It prutes sense of smell. Ah. After sex production of the hormone prolactin surges, this intern causes stem cells in the brain to develop new neurons in the brain's old factory bulb its small center. I know some used to work in an old factory. I think it was Kennedy where Ryan Rees. Reduce risk of heart disease. Listen to this. Yeah. In 2001, follow up to the Queen's University study mentioned about researchers focused on cardiovascular health. They're finding that by head, oh, this goes on at length. I'm going to read the whole thing. That by having sex three or more times a week, then reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke by half. Squirt score. And half. They cut it in half. In reporting these results, study co-author Sean Abraham. What the old is he now? Oh, oh, if he's orthodox, he knows a lot. The orthodox Jews screwed their brains up. 2030, 40 kids. Displayed the well of British gift for understatement. Relationship found between frequency of sexual intercourse and mortality is considerably of pubic interest he said. Oh, I got to get into the whole thing. Heavy duty, okay? Do a real pubic service for this audience. Who I'm sure they're sitting on the agency right now to reach in for it.

Well congratulations, get a light. Hi. This is Jocelyn Elders and I'm man. Man at those right wing suns and bitches that first bill clent in the fire me. Just hold on to hell they think they are. All I was trying to do was deal with the reality of sex and teenagers. Maybe if Jesse Holmes had buffed the chip or a new gang rich had buttered the card a little more, there wouldn't be so uptight. Vlogging the dog never heard anybody. And if people did a little more that we might save some lives, tell him clent in just stay at home and spank the monkey. He'd even be in less hot water. Teaching kids about masturbation would be no big deal. We could even take some standard teaching tools and just twist them around a little bit like C-Dick Run. When you see Dick Run, get to the doctor because you picked up a back-ass of the crowd's crickets. Folks, we got to get real about the realities of the world we live in. There are too many kids out there taking a baloney ride and parking their yacht in hair harbor. Now if we just teach them to stay home and paddle the pickle, pump the python, walk the door, wax the carator, tickle the taco, we don't all be better on. That's all I have to say. Now I'm going home now and see if Mr. Elders wants to pop it in the toast. And hail oyster and buzz the Braille. Prop 32 at 560 WQAM.

I don't have time. We've got an important sex stuff here, okay? Weight loss and overall fitness. Sex, if nothing else is exercise, a vigorous bout. Burned some 200 calories about the same as running 15 minutes on a treadmill, or playing a spirited game of squash. The pulse rate in a person around rises from 70 beats per minute to 150, the same as that of an athlete putting forth maximum effort. British researchers have determined that the equivalent of six big max can be worked off by having sex three times a week for a year. Muscular contraction during intercourse work the pelvis, thighs, buttocks, rectum, arms, neck, and thorax. Sex also boost production of testosterone which leads to stronger bone, bones, and muscles. Men's health magazine is going so far to call the bed the single greatest piece of exercise equipment ever invented. Absolutely correct. We do his depression. Such was the implication of a 2000 to in fact because Scott is so depressed there today because his ex wife is a bitch. I think what he ought to do is go in the ear and see if Clarissa is down or waiting in the doogie style. On all fours. Huh? At the push beast out of the way. Such was the implication of a 2002 study of 293 women American psychologist Gordon Gallop reported that sexually active participants whose male partners did not use his connooms were less up to depression than those whose partners did one theory of casualty of a cosyate causality. Prost a gland in a hormone found already in semen. Maybe absorbed in the female genital tract that's modulating female hormones. Of this modulating you, honey. That's what Kobe said. A ledge. Pain relief immediately before orgasm. Squared squirt. Levels of a hormone. Oxy-oxy cotton. Hey, right. Oh no. Oxy-tasin. Ox-acidicin. Man, I hate to weigh the mid spell all these words. Just they don't want you to pronounce them or I like marine dog. The hormone oxythus inserts the five times in a normal level. This in term releases endorphins which alleviate the pain of everything from headache to arthritis, even migraine. And women sex also are a production of estrogen which can reduce the pain of PMS. Less frequent colds in flu. Roaks University in Pennsylvania is as individuals who have sex once your twice a week show a percent higher level. About 30. 30% higher level of an antibody called immunoglobulin A which is known to boost immune system A. Better bladder control. Herd of keagle exercises? Yeah. You have? Sure. You do them whether or not you know what every time you stem your flow of urine. The same set of muscles is working during sex. A happier prostate. Some neurologists believe they see a relationship between infrequency of ejaculation, cancer, the prostate. The casual argument causes, I keep saying casual, well it's casual and causal. Argument goes like this. To produce seminal fluid, the prostate and the seminal vessels take such substances from the blood as zinc, Cypric acid and potassium and then concentrate them up to 600 times. Any carcinogen present in the blood likewise would be concentrated. Rather than have a concentrated carcinogen hanging around causing trouble, it's better to evict them. Regular old sex could do the job. But if the flushing of the prostate were your only objective, masturbation might be a better way to go, especially for the non monogamous male. When a doubt yank it out, having sex with multiple partners can all buy itself raise a man's risk of cancer, but up to 40%. That's because he runs an increased risk of contracting sexual infections, so if you want all the purported benefits of flushing with them of the attendant risk go digital. Like WQA, right. We're going digital. We're sticking a finger deep inside your radio. A study recently published by the British Journal of Eurology International asserts that men in their 20s can reduce by a third their chance of getting prostate cancer by ejaculating more than five times a week.

Oh, yes sir. I fight, buddy. And here she is. Hey, baby. You got the crotchless panties? Yes. Cool. Where are we going? The movies? Nope. My trailer for some sex. That's the spirit. Bye, honey. Hi, pumpkin. Bye. And Rex, yes sir? Safe from me. Yes sir.�.�.�.�.�.�.�.�.�.�.�.�. You will get scared of her. You will… сдom. Now when you look at the first episode on the assembly line and it looks the final season of Mot. Be Marta. dust fester. Your impression between video games is set on video game can be assigned that something is seriously on the fritz, especially where the culprit is an infirm erection. Now that was signature, the only other person I ever know of in my life, whoever used that word was the race caller, Richard Cago at Arlington, Phil George F. I don't know what he means. Who called John Henry, the signature of the horse racing and the like the the you know, no, the epitome, the I see the standard bearer, the you know, the MS. Dr. J. Fraswaw I, the urologist with a while medical college of Cornell University and New York Presbyterian Hospital, observes that he erectile dysfunction is the extension of the vascular system. A lefthargic member may be telling you that you have disease blood vessels elsewhere in your body. It could be the first sign of hypertension or our diabetes or increased cholesterol levels. It's a red flag, a flag that you should see or doctor. Well, by the way, I want to apologize all these years. I've been insisting that people who smell bad from different parts of the world do so because of the fact that it's like an epic thing. It's in their um, die in pigment and in their diet and then I cook. I'm wrong. Okay. People smell bad need to see a bar of a bar coast. I was spraying anything like that. Fa, fa. Freeman exercises. I can have things looking up again. What a clever play on words. Men who exercise have a good heart and have a low heart rate and who are cardio fit have firmer erections. There is very definitely a relationship. But is there such a thing as too much sex? The answer and pure physiological terms is this. If you're a female, probably not. If you're a male, you betcha. Really? Damn it. Dr. Clear Bailey of University of Bristol says there is a learn overskable woman's overdosing on sex. In fact, she says regular sessions can only for me. Women's tummy and buttocks, but also improve her posture. Back to him. Dr. George Wins Jr. And obstetrician gynecologist in Elco Nevada concur as if a woman is pemenopuzzle and otherwise healthy says Winsch for having an extraordinary amount of intercourse, agnautopos, a problem and extraordinary amount. I mean like 20, 30, 40, 50 times a day, maybe 20, 30 times an hour. Just like a agyagetic. Get the whole NFL to line up. I don't think women can have too much intercourse. He says so long as no sexually transmitted disease is introduced and there's not an inadvertent pregnancy. Oh, really? That last part again. Stop. Real long is no sexually transmitted diseases introduced and there's not an inadvertent pregnancy. Some say that's how I got here. No, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about your compatriots sitting through the glass. As in one piece too much of ass. Sometimes you can have a lubrication problem. You have that. There can be vaginal excreation. The general scrape. Oh man, that's one of the worst vaginal scrape. Huh? What is that? It burns. Scrape it out. Get the cheese grater. That's what Corbyn was driving. In fact, I'm thinking about this. Maybe the priest that we've been condemning all of these last few years. Maybe the priest are just concerned about the health of the altar boys. You're going to go up right there, milking them. They exactly. Well, we're trying to make sure that there have very low chance of prostate cancer and all of these other terrible things. Maybe they're assuring their future better health. You think so? No. No way to check for sure. If I say, let's take all of those child Mustang priest and others, let's take them all. But a guy from Chicago, they interfered on that five volus today. And like line them up. Put on a day and rather than he needs a goose and ratings. Then he's a goose. What's the frequency, Kenneth? Fill your Jeff. John Henry of these. Sign you sure over the house racing. What an asshole. Women who have stained from sex run some risks. Impostment apostle women, these include vaginal atrophy. Winches a middle age patient of whom he says, she has not in a course in three years. He just isn't interested. The opening of her vagina is narrowing from this use. It's a condition that can lead to dysparinia or pain associated with intercourse. In other words, it's just like trivling up and dying. It's dying over there. Oh, that's so sad. Let's have a funeral. Or let's have a party. As per man, you're all of just, I'd say it's definitely possible to get too much of a good thing. Now that drugs such as vagua and la vitra have given men far more staying power than may actually be good for them. Too many pills. Not good, okay? Maybe a couple pills here and here, not too bad. But too many freaking pills, not a good thing. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. See, there's a classic example right there, living proof. The penis said, I'd as wonderfully resilient. But everything has its limits. Peanut, a penal tissues, if given all of this here, made by somebody strapped yourselves in. Everybody strapped, strapped in. Everything has its limits. Peanut, tissues, if given two roistering or prolonged a pummeling. Roistering. What the hell is that? Remember, to raise two, use to play for the grave. What is a roistering? Plum pummeling. Sure need your dictionary for the article. Peanut, tissues have given two roistering or prolonged a pummeling can sustain damage. In cases you just assume not hear about permanent damage. He gads. Yes, as I, it's possible for a young man who's very forceful and likes roughsecks to damage his erectile tissue. The drugs increase rigidity moreover than make it possible for man to have second and third orgasms without having to wait out intermission. With no pause, no time for popcorn. I see it in pro football players's eyes. They use Wagner because they're so sexually active. What they demand, they'd like J. P. LePher example when he's going to be on with a motormower, you know? Absolutely. He's got a loop that's thing up 20, 30, 40 times before. And I'm talking about his act. I'm going to, smoking it is head all the way in there. They use Wagner because they're so sexually active. What they demand are their bodies unreasonable. It's part of playing football. You play through the pain. This type of guy doesn't listen to his body. He takes a shot of cortisol and keeps on going. And they have sex in similar fashion like the energizer body. They just keep on going and going. And there's a reason the penis in its natural state undergoes a period of flaceted the flaceted. Even with some of you cissis out there, it's flaceted. Oh, and let me start again this paragraph. You're like this one too. There's a reason the penis in its natural state undergoes a period of flaceted. That's what it takes to breathe her. Didn't you ever hear go, ha, ha, ha, ha. The blood within it is replenished with oxygen. During an erection explains, I'd very little blood flows to the penis during thrusting, pershing your as high as 200 mill of water. Zero blood flows into the penis at that time. Thank goodness. To absorb oxygen, the tissue must become relaxed. If you don't allow the penis to rest in the muscle tissue, does get enough oxygen, maybe how about like out getting an oxygen tank? No, takes. The individual gets prolonged erections gets decreased oxygen to the tissue and could potentially suffer pre-opism adside. And then it says, we recommend you get a medical and cyclopidian look at up. I've seen that word before. I don't know what it is. It's when you have an erection and you can't get rid of it. Permanent. Yeah. No. Not a good thing. The muscle comes so in gorge. It's painful. Pressure inside starts to increase cell-star dying. More pressure and less blood flow eventually. The muscle dies than it is scarring. That's like the old vaginal scrape. That's why he says it's considered an emergency. This is part of an article I was in Forbes magazine. Ready for that? And for that. Buy Alan Farhanhamg Forbes.com and get the whole article on there.
