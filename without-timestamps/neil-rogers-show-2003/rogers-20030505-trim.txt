I think the following 60 seconds have disappeared. But I took that race as a gift for 140 awaitengers. Let's drop the score from 50o. I don't know what you're saying. How come not one person voted for? I got up this instant. I'd like to meet this sound even a little bit like Ken Maldon. This sound even vaguely like Ken. Well we'll find out. But in the meantime we got one hell of a battle going on between... Absolutely correct. And not turn man. We might leave it on there a couple of minutes and see how this plays out. You know what? Because this is very urgent. Might just came up with in three. I don't know what yours is. 298. But you got 201 to 198. Oh there's one more for... Not 30 man. That... Anyway about 30 man 201. Absolutely correct sir 198. Am I gonna have to play all these? I'm not gonna go down a whole list. It's too long of a list. There's no fact in the church. That had 132. Because then I got to like... It puts the lotion in the basket. That had 114. That's the America T-shirt. That's the American T-shirt. 100. So all of those had over 100. Right on the edge of 100. Do...do...do...do...do...do...do... 98. I can't do all of those. I can't play them all. Thine over here 98. And then of course a recent... Favorite. Big time. I sure. 95. Reverend Jones your gay 84. Blackthumb. Mitch Lewis 68. The managed keychain 63. The products in the that stuff didn't really do all that great. Other than the managed keychain. 57. Mad Dog. Alright. 52. Unbelievable. 41. That's...that's not the one. Unfailable. 41 votes. And then of course the Ever Famous for Trigues. I do have to play this. Because we don't play it off enough and that's your fault. You should say how come you never play? Yo yo yo. Let's rate both. And then I'd play it. Then at 35 votes. All of these things 31. Fish food 30. It's Friday. You've mastered 30. Charlton Heshton's. You son of a bitch 27. Thanks for calling 25. Years. Uh-huh. 24. That was a one George pick. Uh-huh. 24. Small potatoes. Loll me fifty dollars Larry King 21.

Jimmy and Danny 17. And systematic Katherine Jesus 16. I'm not going to go to the second page. So that yeah, look at that four vote margin between. Absolute. Reckless in second place and. 30 man. Which is in first. Tight. Those two. So I think what we'll do today in honor of that is just all day will play. 30 man. That's the will. Correct. Huh? All day. 30 man. Absolute. For four hours. Probably get higher numbers than this ball stuff. We're going to have on this week. But that's really sad. You know, and now you tell me that mole left and I will really go to a some stupid golf tournament. And then mad dog in the handkerchief. He brought casting from some stupid golf tournament today. Oh, brother. That's really sad. That is so, so unbelievably sad. We wonder why the sports segments are like a little bit lacking in big numbers. Golf is not a sport. It's a game. It's a game for blue noses and for bored, tired old men with iracos fiends. That's golf. For blue nos assholes. The golf thing to go in there. I can tolerate the other sports insanity. Even though it enters sometimes drives me up the wall on this radio station. As if I haven't been able to say about it anyway. Do I have anything to say about it? No. But the golf stuff. That's just, it just drives me up the wall. Drives me up the freak of wall. A horse didn't do too good on Saturday in the derby. Poor little Tyler Bayes there. He got stuck left and agate. Got squeezed at the start. Indian up Indians Creek. Whatever it was. And the finished 14. Was just caught in all kinds of traffic along the inside. I got caught in the first turn. Damn. You fell down and then I got pinched back to 14. Never was in a running. We were going to float empire maker. I'm going to split it in float empire maker. And it's a fact. What do you mean you were going to float him? What does that mean? I put him first with every horse. Put him second with every horse. Put him third with every. We're going to keep him wheel him. I mean he has low. See float is not a race track word. Well, I'm not a race track guy. He's a ruggie. Pretty obvious. Leo alien just got off the van. That's a good. That's a good. That floating. See you float it up on shore. That was where the float. InterTube. Great. Floating is not so you're going to wheel him. So why didn't you do that? What did the exactid paid? Funny side was trouble one with. But the great Jose Santosa should point out. Oh, it was a crappy race. It was a crappy race. The only excitement was before the race when they showed the crowd in the infial Allows college student celebrating and getting all whipped up to a frenzy. That was pretty exciting. The sum of us. That's that right now. Not as exciting as that movie. I saw over the weekend. That's night. Donnie Brasco. I'm going to talk about that and movies in general. Mom materially. That's a good movie. You're. Thanks to a my good post personal buddy Johnny Depp. Nice going Johnny baby. Come on over. Let's see what you look like. Do you know that Johnny Depp is 40 years old. Well, in June, June 9th. That's what I checked his birthday. June 9th he'll be 40 years old. Wow. grew up in Miramar Florida. That's what it says on the on the DVD on the bio thing. And they're all. Uh, he told us. See Miramar and Helen they aren't they across the street for me. Yeah. Yes. So depending on what block you live in, you could be like in both. They're like side by side side by each. But it says Miramar, but I think he grew up in Helen. What he told me that morning he was on a show on Zeta seems like only yesterday that he and I. We, they took our picture. God, I still wish we had that picture. I sure wish I had that picture. It was Johnny and his black leather jacket. Yeah. He was great. And then he was on a basketball Al Pacino on the other hand was kind of like El Martino's voice. We, it was really wicked. His acting in that movie was so bad. And in spite of that, if you haven't seen Donnie Brasko, I go out and pick up the DVD right now. I would go out and grab it. Just like Johnny Dec, I'd grab there in the airport. Grab this private. Early, so he said. I was going to excuse. That was a good story. Pretty creative. Yeah. So I have a paper channel over here. I'm going to put you in a movie with so freaking bad. God was he awful. Ticksy tick last night. Anybody was there? According to the story, we got they wild the crowd and there were no protestors. There was one guy wearing a t-shirt that said. Bush ain't proud you're from Texas either. And he still showed up. He says, would want to pay for the tickets if I'm coming. If I do come, I'm going to let him know how I feel. He said, this guy, what that was his name, you bank? What was his first name? Does this guy have a first name? This is the story in a Palm Beach called Mark you bank. 42 before the start of the show. The t-shirt was about the most vocal protest to be registered the entire evening. Despite all the fuss agreed the Dixie chicks top of the world tour which kicked off and stopped her line of last week to re-reviews and gigantic crowds. South Florida greeted the group with open arms and outside. There wasn't one pick at inside. They had two in her land. They had a pair. And that was all. And a Yahoo place like Orlando. Inside the Macaroon Alastair, a thunderous welcome of Leroy Did any hint of the name calling it's been heard over talk radio by the right wing assholes. So they nearly sold out proud of better than 15,000. These weren't the Dixie twits or sadams angels. They were just three women singing their hearts out. They weren't the three Frenchans either by the way, Jerry. Jerry, fall why do you asshole you? You fat face piece of crap? This is a story that I think you're reading on appreciate. That we missed over the weekend, bein' her boy. And what happened over the weekend, but did we sponsor the audience? I think George has got something on. He's got his thumb on it. They had this Iraq war burn out now. And goes to show you the attention span of the American public. We've been breaking all records every weekend on that website. Just phenomenal. And look at all our good stuff we hit on this weekend. And just, maybe there's a lot of important stuff going on. Did they had the air show yesterday or over the weekend, right? That's right. I can't think of anything else that's going on. Was there barway? They sure avoided us like to play on our website over the weekend. But that's okay. We don't take it personal. We let this story out on Saturday. Maybe if we'd have put this on, we'd have to work with a spread around town. Massage-choose-its town meeting segregated by sense. C-E-N-C-S. Shoot-spir-massage-choose-its. Something spelled foul to burn our parace at Saturday's annual town meeting, but it wasn't the usual hint of colon or perfume. What put is knows how to join? Was the fact that residents who wore sense were segregated from the Freigman's free? Okay. I think it's out of hand-send parace. 77 is morning splash of after-shape since dissipated. Some of the crazy stuff that come up with nowadays is voloni, which has a scent of its own. If you ever sit like on a bus or anywhere like next to somebody that was eating or had just eaten like a sandwich or a sub sandwich? Yeah. Or a voloni sandwich? What? That stinks. Oh yeah, the air salad. But that's kind of like an after-effect. It says people who say they suffer from a condition known as multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome. MCSS, over the love of God, said the town's decision to separate the scented from the odorless left-dem breed easier. I've had a leave town meetings in the past because maybe the crow is there, maybe he sent them all scattering. Set them all. I've had a leave town meetings in the past because there's been somebody wearing perfume, and a Julie Taylor 49 who says she breaks out in rashes, has problems breathing gets a fever when she's exposed to heavy-sense. Oh, she gets a fever must be SARS. I'm glad the town is doing this now. I can participate without a serious risk to my healthy B-sand. As for other parts in the way, Linda, animal meeting in the 268 year old shoots, very town of 1800 people like to ember scholars, it's the time for residents to debate and vote for their leaders bylaws and budgets. Before this year's decision, the town's Americans with disabilities at Committee identified ten residents with MCS-s, multiple chemical sensitivities in Rome. At the board suggestion, town officials created a sentless seating area in the school's gym. Oh my god, I sure hope nobody cuts one in there. Anyone imagine? If you've got heavy-sense sensitivity to that? Oh, god. I think everybody's real sensitive to that, like you're in a crowd of people. If you're on a plane. Yeah. See the charcoal in those seats on a plane. That's supposed to absorb the aroma. Believe me, it doesn't work. I think maybe it stores it for release later. Yeah, stores it for the next poor bifters going to sit on there. Next time they sit down and put pressure on it. It just kind of like seeps up into the air. And the scent of the aroma just fills your nostrils and your sinus passages and your whatever. Twelve minutes past nine at five sixty WDQM. You know, talk is cheap.

Good luck this instant. Now, do you find out is that Ken Maldon? Oh, you have to wait for him to come in. Oh, that's not him. Okay. Peter Boy, you think that sounds like Ken? Who put that in there? It does not make him to me, but maybe they saw it out. This instant. No. So you don't even know who put it in. It will work for Moistie Lank. Good luck this instant. Good luck this instant. He maybe if we played often now. Good luck this instant. At any rate, look what's happened on the pole before we put up the new one. Look at that. Absolutely, Rick, Rick. Just moved into first place. Back and see, this is what happens over the weekend. These other people were, you know, push it heavy duty on, but third man. But after we're leading all the way through Friday and most of the Saturday, absolutely, Rick, Rick, Rick. Who's back into first place and we're going to declare it to win a roundway? OK. That was fucking great. I was. 217, 207 for the other one. Not turning man. Now, here's today's poll. Which of these people is the biggest media attention figure? The reason I put this on is poll is because I'm so nauseated and disgusted with his Mark Garagos. Like I told you Friday, when they broke the story on TV, about how he was named the new attorney in the Lacy Scott Peterson case. And it's just, you just, where's you out? I just can't stand it. It's like the same doesn't people there, just never ending. They're always there in front of the camera. You know who we left off on here? I give up. Johnny Conkring. Oh, yeah. Right, right. We could also put out sharp to none there. Nah, nah. He actually had a couple of funny lines in that debate, and I also saw some clips, but he had a couple of lines, which, that tells you a lot about the other guys. Palm Beach Post is conducting a poll in today's newspaper. Who would you want to see is the Democratic nominee? And guess is winning by a landslide by a good margin. Cholibraman. Now he's there. He's there. Well, Palm Beach, you know, they think, they'll, they'll want to vote for Cholibraman, but they'll want to vote for Papu Cannon. Oh, seriously, he's there. How are dean? Really. You think did Bob Graham in Palm Beach County? And I mean, Bobby, is doing pretty good. He's second place, but I think how are dean? I'd like 53% and Graham, like 28, and Cholibraman did about 12%. I think maybe Graham has about 30, man. Like that. Here's the poll. Which of these people is the biggest media attention seeker? Oh, this is cute. U.S. has candid occurs to much about liberties. I got to get the page if you want to. Oh, you can just go to the site. Oh, look at this. This is cute. Who do you think you're fooling this grud? It doesn't matter how many phone he writes. You get in the people section about what hot model you're dating this week. We all know you're secret. If you're so straight, why don't you sue Alec Baldwin for claiming that you made a pass on him, confirm bachelor my ass about us confirmed his fall and confirmed queen. Oh, my God. Who sent that? Pax her. Some anonymous facts about their suggestion that Ms. Grudge really is a lady. Oh, I can't believe that. Not with a hat like that. Anyway, here's the list we have so far. Which of these people is the biggest media attention seeker? Nancy Grace, Mark Garagos with that big ugly mustache. See somebody ought to tell him that that kind of mustache when I would jury Colona and only a poker Brian. I remember who that is. Murderer Colona? No. Good. That's a good sign. Heralda Rivera, Steve Mr. Ego Kane, even though he's small potatoes. Ellis Ruben, Jesse Jackson and Johnny Cochring. That's what we have so far. Think about a put O.J. on there. I mean, it wouldn't hurt. Nah, I don't think so. Because mostly the attention he gets isn't by design. It's just big buy because he's such an aberration of the human race and he can't stop doing all this crap. I'm talking about some of that goes out of their way. It's on there just in your face constantly morning and noon and night you can't get away from them ever. I'm the talking head shows especially. I think that's a pretty good list to start. Yeah. And then the other thing that I want to find out about today and not just today, we can do this forever. Because I did find to get off my lazy ass. And I went over and I got me some DVDs yesterday. I got bored identity with that and Damon haven't watched it yet. But at your urging your a Thony Brasko, let's hear it for George. Finally, I mean, he gave pay to good one. Done at Grasko's and outstanding movie. I give it four and a half stars on a scale of five. The half star missing because of Al Pacino's grow test acting job. It's unbelievable how guys like him. And I love Al Pacino. But he's good. Right. But the thing I've discovered about Pacino is he's either very, very, very good like in Godfather's one and two or he's very, very bad like in Godfather's three and in set of a woman and in Tani Brasko. If you really watch the movie, you know I have to watch that carefully. You don't have to be like a connoisseur film. But you'll notice even the casual viewer that he keeps repreasing roles that he played other movies. There are a couple of scenes in there where he's like doing Godfather three all over again. And then there's throughout the movie. He's doing set of a woman. And he's doing that same character. True. The blind guy. And it just keeps lapsing into these things from other movies. Even as a parent's keeps changing throughout. But Tani and put the Johnny Depp as great name. And we Johnny Depp, one of the unsung heroes and I'll say it again. I don't give a crap what anybody says. Believe me speaking of connoisseurs. I know my people. Okay. I know my hot looking people. Whatever they might be. Now this movie was made in 1987. Funny Grasko. Can you really? It's that old. I mean 1990s. Oh, I see. 1987, 1997, six years ago. So Johnny Depp was like 33, 34 years old when I moved to Kmart. If ever there was a person who looked more pristine. You want to mean like not a people. I know you may have had like a couple on a face like a couple like little Zit Mark. You know what I mean like people. But I don't think so. How do you know? George has been expecting Johnny Depp's uh... Bracom private. Oh, listen. Don't forget about our contest. It's underway now. Right. Another way from the we don't have any more emails. More pictures of the same entrance. Oh, no, we don't want that. So we can put the best ones on there. Oh, I see. Oh, okay. Anyway, email us pictures of yourselves. Any couples out there were doing the hot couples contest for the next three months. Made June and July. And you have until Thursday may 15th to email George pictures of yourselves. And then they starting May 15th pictures of the up on our website for a week. And the people out there can vote on their favorite, which is the hottest couple. Thursday may 22nd, the couple with the most votes wins. And the grand prize a three day two night stay for two of the world-awesies resort and casino in Bahamas with round trip air through our lake of areas. Run around gets dinner for two of the pizza loft. I'm surprised we didn't have more than that. We got about seven couples participating so far. Right. Let's get with it. Okay. Let's get on top of it. So like I said, Donnie Bracom was excellent. But Al Pacino and maybe there's somebody disagree with me. We've actually had people call them and show defending the movie set of a woman. Tell me how great his performance was in here. He won the Oscar for that movie, didn't he? I don't recall. I mean, who's been in so many great movies from dog day after noon to godfather's parts one through three two and just as for all right. So many brilliant acting jobs and a piece of crap contrived, got overacted. The acting in the set of a woman was so overacted. He would have been gone. He would have been gone. John's shown the first two minutes for overacting. But he's just gotten into this thing now where he and some of his movies. He just repreases rules from other movies and he laughs his back into him and you'll wonder if they're not like just letting him do it because he's him. Go to think. Yeah. I was Pacino. We're not going to mess with him. Just put his name on a marquee and the people will come. They'll watch. I must be it. But Johnny depth overheat outchowner man. I don't care what anybody says. He was the asshining star. Nice gone Johnny. Good hell and Bill boy. I'm 20 stay as far as pimples on his ass. I know he's 40 years old now. But I think we're going to have to probably do an inspection. See he's forgotten about us about me. Not about you. He don't know. Anyway, he's forgotten about me. Sure. I can't go say the day's because that was 86. He was 23. He was just young actor. Startin' out. He wasn't a really huge name yet. And he was big. Is what the bird told me.

Oh, remember that? And I kept thinking of the I got you down. I just mentioned that in passing. You know, it's this poll today could be the most difficult of all time. I said here and like just with a frozen finger. Yeah, give it a frozen finger. Watch where you stick it and not knowing who to vote for it. But the poll is up now. I guess you and I both voted. I didn't because I'm having internet problems here. You're having internet problems there again. Oh, no, not internet problems at Q. I am. That's got to be a bad mistake. George must be just making that. I don't have a no internet problems here. Anyway, Jason Faxes and says the deaf get off this instant. Go off. Go off this instant. Sounds like Ben Stein to me. Just my opinion. He said I've been, you know, that I've not just been Stein from when Ben Stein's money. The investigation continues because neither I nor Miguel nor Carlos put that in there. Really? We don't know where it even came from. God, good luck. This instead is not Ken Maldon. If it, I mean, if that's Ken Maldon, I'm better Carlos and your life on it. And after when mode two, that is not Ken. Good luck. This is now. Maybe somebody else knows who the hell I was. And also, well, we really need you from the audience. Because now that I'm into the DVD thing, so you give me a DVD player what about you to a year ago. But a year ago, right? As a birthday gift, which is, you know, George, it's going to birthday gift. Everything else he's pretty marginal, but on birthday gift he's excellent. And to give me a DVD player, which, you know, but all the other electronics I got 50 satellite dishes, all kinds of crap. I never bothered with one. Because where do you stick it, you know? Right. And I just never had the time to be to get into it. But now that I'm here and I went out and got me a DVD player several months ago. And, you know, and I don't have the dogs to deal with. I have to be running into the track to keep certain people happy. And so I got a lot more time. And I can sit back and I can go the the stores now. I've got 80 billion DVDs. Almost everything has ever been made. Except for Redwood. And I looked it up on Amazon.com this morning. Come to find out. Edward has me released on DVD yet. So I'm going to have to buy it on VHS. Which I will. Bob Roberts, which has saw just the Ancindor. And amazingly neither George or I ever saw the movie. Right. So I'm just the Ascent of it with Tim Robbins and Susan Sermina and Gorvid Alvin. Even it was made 11 years ago. And I checked that out. It's coming out in June. They're released in that. I guess it's only like in the last few months that the real explosion is hit with a DVDs. And just about everything it's ever been made is going to be released on DVD. So I'm going to make a list from people. And I'm not talking about movies that you know. We've seen like the godfather in network and gone with the wind. I'm talking about movies that maybe don't immediately come to your mind. You know, is the most famous of all time. But movies that you really have to see. I'm going to start making a list. So Ken Maldon says. Yes, that's not him. I told you that. Didn't say anything like Ken Maldon. Well, the mystery continues. Peter Boy, who is the one to kept on us? That's Ken Maldon. It was George. That was George. That's, that's, that's, that's, and our front to my good friend Ken. I mean, not that this guy's got a bad voice. But just so, so, so, got up this instant. You know what I mean? So different. And not one that we ever heard before. Maybe it's what it does. Old pals. You know, maybe it's one of his acquaintances. Maybe it's Tanner. That is not Miss Tanner. Okay. Please. Oh, look at that. Look who's running to pull nearly returns here. And I was very difficult for me. 34 votes now. Just when I've a couple of minutes ago. Which of these people is the biggest media attention seeker. A publicity horror. Jesse Jackson 18. Haraldos got seven. Nancy Grace III. Margaragos II. Johnny Cochrane II. Ellis Rubin I. And Mr. Ego Steve Canes got one. Don't know if he's not putting monitors because they might may or thing, you know. But when you have an audience, you could fit in a telephone booth. I guess you're not really getting all the attention that you could probably use or want. WQAM. Hello. Yeah, I want four of the coos is not for sure. In the morning. Uh, I know. WQAM. Hello. Yeah.

Yeah, you're right. He's under. Five. Thanks. He's right. I resisted it. Only because I don't know. Because I resisted it. Put now sharp than under. Please. You got to be in a boy. Right. These down now. Because we're not. You know, I'm not that we're going to have like thousands of people on this list. I don't think. But there aren't many of them. And they just keep reappearing over and over. And of course, you know who is responsible for a lot of them. Yeah, the Kingmeister, our good post personal friend. Who just, well, our panel. We got this panel. You only just do those. And no matter what kind of it is that happens, what if somebody gets killed, somebody stole a freight train. Here comes the panel again. And the panel amazingly always turns out to be the same people again. Mix and match. See, I've never been able to figure out that the other unless you've got a massive ego. And most of these people are well healed. It's not that they're missing any money or any meals. But what is the point of going on those shows? I mean, I've turned down a zillion of those things. What's it going to do for me? Is it going to make me wealthy? Oh, yeah. Well, what's the point? What is it going to do? How about Gloria already? Do you think she ought to be on there? Well, I hate her. She's fine. Yeah, let's put that bitch on her to Gloria all red. And I have no idea how you spell her name. Be careful, but it's spelling okay. It's like, Eric, it's real upset when you misspelled words. Carlos calls me up and bitches bitterly about it. WQAM, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. What about Ann Colter? Ann Colter, is it good one? Yeah, because I can't say that bitch. Have you ever seen her with Matt Grudge? No, I never seen her. Same person, okay. Thank you. And Colter belongs on list.

I've sooner or later, all the drags man, it just that stuff keeps seeping down the stream, downhill. Just look at that map and watch everything go just down through the Appalachians, right down to your old Hershey highway and into that big Penicula. 23 for Jesse, 10 for her all to Rivera.

We're supposed to be in a five-season 2-A-M. It just felt like a prick. It's a new reality show on Fox this time. We'll try and prove once and for all that when it comes to true love, looks no matter. 20-MASTH Bachelors will vibe her attention and affection of one lucky lady. Monterey-Lawinsky hosts, Mr. Personality. Okay guys, this is our beautiful single young lady. Bachelors number one with the Richard Nixon mask say hello. Hey are you done huh? How about those fun pillows on you? Whoa! Okay, Bachelors number six with the TH Mutant Ninja Turtle mask. You're turned. Hey what's up this week, cake? How's it going to tug on your web, Piffy? Okay, Bachelors number 12 with the William Shetner mask. Actually I'm more interested in you baby. Not hostess with the most. At Boyz sounds very familiar. What a little bit of a little. Silly Billy with the crooked Willie. Is that you? Ha ha ha ha. Hey this sounds supposed to be about me. Hey back down to there sexy, Filly. I don't actually have relations with her. Well in my mind, she's just the owl in the Tutsy roll pop commercial. Son and dog. What do you mean, Billy? Shut up, I love you. Mr. Personality. On Fox. We want to back badly. 945 and 560 and WCM. Here's a great thanks. Well here's two of them. I'll do the short one first. P.R. Ralph, your close personal friend. Yes. And we'll be done in Brasco. The club that he buys put plantation on the map. It was Dan Dowds on 441. Dan Dowds, he used to have the big moukow and front that's now in front of Kimbo Campers to join. All right. Right. Right. Dan Dowds. What was a horrible place? Oh, and he had like a meat market in, well anyway. But I didn't know that. And the one thing I did notice was a little bit disappointing. Was that there was really very little footage of South Florida. Right. Which was supposed to have been in 1978. So I don't know. Maybe it was a budgetary thing because you know when they do those old things, they have to like, you know what I'm saying? Right. Like for example, in the godfather, too, wasn't it the moment where the Myrlanski? Yes. And I have no idea how they do that either. Do you? How they do what? How they recreate the old neighborhoods and make it look, I guess they go in and find some other road roads. Have you driven through any of those neighborhoods lately? Like I said. They just wait long enough and then they look like they did. It's funny. It's the right man. It's the eye. Anyways, is in a movie Donnie Brasco. The club that he buys King. What was it called? King's Court? Something like that. Yeah, that's what it was because I just saw it last night, even my memory in that. But put plantation on the map. Used to be dead. Now thank you for your route. That's amazing. I think I like that. And this is the facts of the century from May, in the day, in heaven, who says, my dear Neil, I just heard you talk about Johnny Depp and Donnie Brasco. How I run it because I just finished a Johnny Depp movie Murathon weekend. So Donnie Brasco done one de Marco if you're loading an LA, which was totally outrageous. Ed Morgas. What? If you're loading a Las Vegas. Was one. That's the name of the movie. What movie? To when you just said you just had fear of loading an LA. Well that's what she's right in here. I understand. Are you correcting Nadine? Yes. Don't be messing with this lady. Okay, because it's a great facts. Especially when we get to the part about a zaz. Fear and loading in Las Vegas, which was totally outrageous, Ed Wood, one, which you must run to see immediately. Also, five stars for when night falls, there's a scene where Johnny who has a small role plays a transsexual in a Cuban prison in Castro's Cuba, circa 1959. His ass is not to be missed and is wonderful face too. How do you like that? Here's Nadine. She's seen a zaz. Well, probably more than once because she says, I'm the lady from formerly from Miramar, who's daughter Julie dated the hung out with them. Johnny and my daughter both graduated from Perry Middle School and he never completed Miramar High School. He was in my home countless times. It was also a bit on the dark side. Thank you Nadine. What an interesting fact that is, huh? Johnny, did you have a little on the dark side? So I bet you maybe what's your daughter's name? Julie. Julie's got some interesting information. Five, six, seven, five, six, pound, five, six, the only AT&T. Not getting any movies from my list. Must see movies, but probably won't. I'll just make up my own mind. I guess the easiest thing is you just go into the store and you got like 75,000. Just keep looking and looking and looking. That's probably not the best way to do it. Bob Roberts, anybody out there see Bob Roberts? Tim Robbins? Probably not. Probably not. Who the QAM? QAM, hello. I'm not a need for the glory, I'm with finger penellas. Okay, week, free week. See, they don't understand it, do they? Never do. They don't get it. Which of these people is the biggest media attention secret, so it is always on your TV. I wouldn't put him in a category at all. Would you? No. Of course, when you're only two feet tall, it kind of hard to stand out in the crowd. But we don't see that much, Jim. Thank goodness. And the best part, one of the great things about being up here. I don't see him at all. We got our own little short row of Mayor Mellasman, but Lisa's got a great sense of humor. He's totally clueless, but Lisa's a funny guy. WQAM, hello. Yeah, I'd be thinking of my own Mr. Neil Rogers. And back to you, sir. All right, one more thing to go. Amy, I'm off. WQAM, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Good morning. All right. It took the Mammie Hill to make the fifth. OK, took the Hill to confirm that Mr. Romso said, I right has no weapons of mass destruction. Yeah. Like I said, this is a joke. It's really, really a joke. And Neil, like a piece of meat, I'm well done. Have a good day. OK. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. The audience is burned out on Iraq. The American public has got a very short attention span. And they don't want to know from that anymore. And all I mean, we got to stir around the minimum count over Racky civilian casualties 2300. Right. That was just in Baghdad. Forget about the rest of the dos just the people that showed up to the hospital and died. Yeah, right. The ones that they could find body parts of 2300. Oh, the best thing right though that we have on our website that we're going to keep on to again today, the bookie of virtue. This right here, this is what it's all about. OK. All you right, wingers out there. All you people are getting sucked in in you too stupid. We even understand why. I, for the life of me. Like I've told you before, unless you're a right wing born again, phonetical Bible thumping Christian or unless you're a multimedia or both, that you have no business following this group of Nazis that we got in running the country now. And here is one of the biggest and the worst William Bennett. Bill Bennett, one of the great finger pointies, one of the pointers, one of the great more or less of all time. Big fat face, tub of crap. Joshua Green in the Washington Monthly and of course this door was in Newsweek everywhere. William J. Bennett has made millions lecturing people on morality and blown it on gambling. How do you like that? Yeah. No person can more be rightly credited with making morality and personal responsibility in integral partly political debate than a William J. Bennett. For more than 20 years as a writer, speaker, government official and political operative, Bennett's been a commanding general in the culture wars. As Ronald Reagan's chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, who was the scores of academic permissiveness, later as Reagan's Secretary of Education. He has scored eight schools in students for failing to set meat high standards, as drugs are under George Herbert Walker Bush, he applied a get-tuff approach to drug use, or arguing that individuals have a moral responsibility to own up to their addiction. Upon leaving office Bennett wrote the book of virtues, a compending of parable snatch-up by millions of parents and teachers across the political spectrum. Bennett's crusading ideals have been adopted by politicians of both parties, and implemented in such programs as character education classes in public schools I testament to his impact. But, but Bennett, a devout Catholic, has always been more old testament than new. Even many who sympathize with his concerns find his competitive style, hotly and unforgiving, Democrats in particular object to his partisan surmanizing which portrays liberals as inherently less moral and conservative, more given away excusing personal weaknesses, and unwilling to confront the vices that destroy families. During the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Bennett was among the president's most unrelenting detractors, his book to death of outrage decried among other things, the public's fate to take Clinton sins more seriously. His relentless efforts to push Americans to do good as enabled Bennett to do extremely well, his best-selling the book of virtues bought in a entire cottage industry from children's books to merchandising tie-ins to a PBS cartoon series, Bennett commands $50,000 per appearance on lecture circuit, and has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants from such conservative benefactors as Richard Melon's scape in John M. Olin foundations. Few vices have escaped Bennett's withering score, and he has opined on everything from drinking a homosexual unions to the Rick and Lake Show to wife swapping. There is one however that is largely escape that it's wrath gambling. This is a notable omission since the issue, morality and public policy are deeply in twine. During Bennett's uses public figures, Casinos once restricted to Nevada, New Jersey, have expanded to 28 states of the number continues to grow, and Maryland where Bennett lives the newly elected public and Governor Robert Erlick's trying to introduce slot machines to fill revenue shortfalls. If Bennett hasn't spoken on more forcefully on an issue that would seem tailor-made form, it's because he himself is a heavy gambler. Indeed, in recent weeks, we're to circulate at a malmarston conservators that is waiting could be a real problem. They have reason for concern, Washington monthly in Newsweek have learned that over the last decade, Bennett has made dozens of trips to Casinos in Atlantic City and Vegas where he's a preferred customer at several of them, and sources and documents provided to Washington Postwood as total losses at more than, strapped yourself in, $8 million. Oh, I don't believe it. $8 million. This preacher of personal morality and goodie two shoes, Cret. Pulle your the now, just like all of them, man. Bennett's been a high role recently since at least the early 90s, a review of one 18-month stretch of gambling showed him visiting Casinos often for two or three days at a time, enjoying a credit line at least 200 granted several of them. He likes to be discreet, he'll usually call a host, and let us know what he's coming says one source we can limbo him in. He prefers to hide limit room where he's less likely to be seen, and he can play the $500 post slots. Oh, my God. He usually plays very late at night early in a morning, usually between midnight and 6am, so in other words, not to be seen. And it's article, even we, the whole thing on our website goes on and on a great length, the bookie of virtue, William J. Bennett, another finger pointing moralist, they're all the same, man. They're all the same. Make no mistake, not most, all of them. Each and every one of these super moralists, these whole year the now-bastures, if you're looking at their closet's man, or skeletons, rattled in a wildlife crazy, even a month's, this will be embarrassed. $8 million, he's pissed away gambling. And I mean, he's entitled, it's his money, he made it. That's the one thing, but on the other hand, he's given everybody else lessons on Moralee, and on life, and on wisdom, and instead of him so on, and how to behave properly, I wonder what Jesus would have thought of that. That $8 million George thinks of a lot of good weed. Yeah. Would soon be, uh, decriminalized here in Canada, I just mentioned that in passing. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, if you don't have one movie to add to my list yet, I'm pretty bitter about that, but we do have that great facts from Nadine about Johnny Devsackham. And she said there were no pimples on it, but it's spent by the way you said, yeah, now maybe in his advanced age, there might have been like, it's a little bit like, you know, what are two? Yeah, you're thinking about it, but there might have been, which of these people is the biggest media horror, the biggest attention seeker. We put attention seeker, there's more like, you know, politically correct, horror sounds pretty drastic. 105 votes, Jesse Jackson 46, hurrah to refer to 20, how sharp in 11, Mark, I told we need to put him on there. Mark Garagos, 6 Johnny, Cockring 5, Mr. Ego, Steve Cains got 5, Nancy Grace only 4, Ellis Ruben 3 and 1, 3 and Gloria all read, has 2 already, as she makes me sick. And she's always got that same read outfit on, and it's same look on her face, like something smells bad. She ought to be in a group in Massachusetts, in the group where Alps said, because something's not bad. She always has that look that pinched nose, like, those something stinks in here, probably it's herself. What's the name of that condition again? I'm never going to remember that. You've specced me to dig through the garbage line, and you look at how much of this is for multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, multiple, and the sorter. 957 is 560 WQM, Mother's Day is coming up Sunday. You might have right spot or not. No, I'm not. See you, you know what? No, because you got me so thrown off balance here, I'm getting way ahead of myself. I'm in a 150 break. Hey.

Dalamatrice sets up the new one and takes away the old vetting for free. So this Mother's Day have mom asleep and like a baby on her new bed from Dalamatrice gets to a bit of a good situation. Call him today, 1-800-M8-T.T.R.E.S. That's 1-800-M8-M8-T. It's a great night's sleep for months and years to come. This is for 20.5-102-2-A. We have mercilessly taken to the following material out of context without endorsement or permission from those depicted. It is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent look as ridiculous as possible. We hope we reach that goal, or at least, may gel out. or at least made a lot. Teachers, families, and law enforcement, we must aggressively promote drugs. The illegal drugs. Now, one of the things that an strategy that I hope you find interesting and as important is that we're actually in the start targeting people like Platinum Moves and Teenagers. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Make no mistake about it. Is the central that our parents convince our children to do their drugs and that's good parenting, which is why without hesitation or apology, the budget estimated to Congress calls for 19 tons of cocaine. No handships or butts. I like cocaine. May God bless you all. 10 or one at five, 60, and WQ, I'm happy Monday to you. My must-see movie list that ain't grown. All I've got is Donnie Brasco, which I bought in watch last night, it was great. Born I didn't leave with mad Damon and haven't watched it yet. Bob Roberts, which I will get, and Edward, which is on VHS. See, and that's my list that they had none. Anyway, here's our poll question. Which of these people is the biggest media attention secret Jesse Jackson 54? Parallel O26, Al Sharpton 19, Itoida? Mr. Ego Steve K9, Mark Garagos 7, Johnny's Cockring 5, Nancy Grayson and Coloury Chaff 4, Ellis Ruben III and Glory All Red 2. These people must not watch Larry. Does nobody hold enough to watch Larry? No. Because he's got Nancy Grayson, or like every five minutes. Air V-50, no matter what the topic is, there's Nancy Grayson and there's just something about her is it only me? Maybe it's only me. But I'll see her and I get angry. I get downright pissed off when I see her face. She's just, she's always pissed off. She's over the top hyper ventilating melodramatic, affected, and full of crap, but other than that, she's dynamite. Yeah, she's just annoying, ugly and has ugly hair. But I guess when I have too many old ladies listening to my show, because that must be who's watching Larry. Huh? 560, 560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Horizon Wireless Line. W-W-A-M, hello. 560, no matter what. Q-A-N. 2-Buzzy Dicking Around. 560, no. 560, but I can tell this is going to be some week. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You could not, seriously, and you're right. When I told you about the, the request for pages on our website, well, way down over the weekend, and spread of the hard ass work that, uh, be to boy and I do want to weekend. Because they're just grown out on that stuff. They just, they want new play to win out. And that's, uh, that the American public for you. So, what is it? Syria. And I'm, I'm, that's what I'm talking about. They don't care about Syria. You're, you're missing the point. You're, you're totally, uh, missing the bold, mister. So, uh, get one of your orders and hop back in your rap. You missed the vote. Speaking of being a boy, I said the George B. for the show, and I'll, I'll see it again. He will, it's a lot of our macho guys in the audience for upset. It's more that gay banter. I don't really care whether you like it or not, because it happens to be true. Johnny Depp, who, who, unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I don't know, but his career, and I've talked about this before. He play all these speaking characters, Edward Ciserhands, and all these guys made up to look weird, you know? Right. But in terms of you show me a guy who looks great, who should ought to be at the top of that list, you know, people magazine does that stupid list every year. Right. Best looking man in the world, Johnny Depp. He makes Brad Pitt look like B. B. Okay. Bye, can I? No, Terzan. I am, I'm telling you right now. See, Brad Pitt is like the Rascal House of Actors. He is. Oh, I mean, he, he was a good looking guy once upon a time. He's been kind of grim now, but he was a very good looking young guy, but he just, you know, he's like the Rascal House overrated. But it becomes a state of mind. So, you know, people, oh, if somebody wants to be food with good looking guys, always a Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt, God. See, even Jennifer got stuck in that. So to speak, oh, she always had good taste. 567. 560. Palm 560 on the AT&T. And additionally, which Brad Pitt is not a good actor. You haven't seen California yet. Okay, but that's one. Okay, that's one. I'm not saying he isn't capable of a good performance, but he's reading out of a very good actor. Johnny Depp on the other hand is an outstanding actor. Yes, he is. He's excellent. And he's getting very old. WCWM, hello. In the act of cast of vote. Yes? Okay, I can't vote for that Reverend Joan God. Give me about. Oh, God. What about that guy? Yeah. WCWM, hello. Yes, you're seeing who we take, I was no good to him. Can't hear you, sir. Hey, back with no good. Mel Gibson? Yes. Won't watch it. Don't watch it. No. For your list, how does Michael Jackson miss that list of media horrors? Uh, yeah, that's true. He ought to be there. Okay, thanks. We'll put him on there. Don't you think? Sure. Yeah, it'd be on there. Of course he does it out of desperation. But how outrageous the thing is, just like to hang in a kid over the edge of the balcony in Germany, just to get to publicity because he thinks it's going to get his name in Oregon, which is always worse. And then he thinks it's going to sell him a lot of records, which is that part isn't working anymore. So he's halfway right. Michael Jackson, good choice, sir. There's a long end list. I won't watch him. Mel Gibson movie. Somebody else in that movie last, that we talked about this before the show in Donnie Brasco was the little, what's his name, the actor? Oh, what, Bruno Kirby. Bruno Kirby. Who's a good actor? He played young Clemenza in Godfather too. He always plays that same kind of role because I guess he doesn't have to act. He's just kind of like a goofy guy. But in this movie, it was just too much like Joe Pesian and Goodfellus. It was almost the carbon copy. And here's the, here's the, here's the wise guy who's just kind of a goofy guy with a squeaky voice. And it was Joe Pesciol over again. Now maybe again, that's just me. Maybe I'm just being too critical, you think? I'm being a prick. No. But I thought he was like Joe Pesciol Jr. Is that a muse? He almost said that. I don't know exactly what he said in one scene. But it was too much to rip off. And I don't know why people do that. You know, these guys that write the screen plays and these directors, why do they do that? Why do people copy people? Yeah. I mean, I mean, I mean, one thing to copy somebody in a subtle way and use some nuances, but to use almost verbatim. I just, I mean, and they talked about if you watch the features on the DVD, the director was on there and the guy who wrote the screen play and they talked about the fact that there was controversy at the time where the writer released on a brass, because good fellows had just come out too recently. Right. And they were afraid that they couldn't match their success. And it was a room for two similar movies at the same time. So that thing, the case, why would you like to rip off somebody of things like imagination? Oh, at least Johnny didn't have all those bits like Ray Leodon. 560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T line QAM. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Wow. He's celebrating. He's going to head start on it. Yeah. No, I'm making no mistake about it. Wow. WQA, hello. Yes, sir. Is it Neil? Sound like Neil. Okay. Hey, go ahead. I'm going to get you. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Is it Neil? Sound like Neil. I'm not going to have a long time. I was looking to get you since when you were back on, Kim, to do it night. Oh, good night. Good night, sir. Tell me about it. Yeah, I just thought you might be interested in, maybe just doing the wrong thing instead of are you budged back and it should be, are you drugs back and what? Oh, you know what? We're going to get him to say it. We're going to get him to do it. I just thought you'd like to know that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, maybe we're misunderstanding what he's saying. I always thought he was saying fudge, but we can do it. If anybody will do it for us, he'll do it. That was good. I think we have a new phrase. Are you drugs packing? I love it. Rectome. That is perfect. 560, pound 560. It's obvious. This audience is a little off today, which is good. We like being a little bit off. Of course, if they have not been on it. No. WQAM, hello. Hi, is it Canyelle? Speaking. Can I give you an actor for the best actor? For the best actor, sure, go right ahead. Is that what you're doing today? No. What go ahead anyway? What are you doing? Best actors are best movies. We're not doing either one, but just keep going. You're off to a great start. Keep going. Okay. I will add Gary Olham. Gary Olham? Yeah. Now, let's, who do you think is better? Gary Olham. Gary Olham. Jeremy Olham. Jeremy Olham. Who do you think is better looking? Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt. Johnny Depp. There you go. See, I rest my case. Thanks. Bye bye. See, she's got Jeremy Olham. Is we got him on a list? Oh, yeah. I'm running into the house. This is great. How do you spell Irons? Oh, my God. That's she was her best colleague a year so far. And that's only a me. That's a good. That was good. Fife. Fife. Fife. Fife. Six, seven, five, sixty. It must be my fault. Maybe I'm not communicating. Okay. Like, jickus is a mother touch with what's happening in the local community. 170 votes on a poll. Not too shabby. Meiner, boys. Not too happy though that you're response. You think it ought to be a lot more. Don't you? Yeah. Eight. I mean, seven days of work. We're working hammer and tongs. Tooth and nail the put all kinds are really interesting.

No, not a lick of trouble overhead But unfortunately young Murray grew up in a more cynical age When L. D. is he can't say have without thinking of a giant pulsing nail member being inserted into somebody's mouth He was really hard. I mean it sucked Even when Murray had tries to explain himself it gets ugly. I mean the toll that head takes on So it was only fitting that Murray had one big hit should contain the word In the title hell it had bang in it too. I guess people could only accept me once I sang a song about Most decadence city in the world where you can get my last name on any street call enough a two bloody dollars Murray had about the only term we haven't used yet as good old oral sex It's a big juicy shopping went like a chill business tonight on inside the mind if you blow too much You're in trouble. There's reason I played that and that's so that's actually just something Michael's actually I thought we had an elist being a boy Yeah Somebody just suggested that I don't see it on elist yet now where our poll today is whatever you want it to be okay best actor of all time most beautiful female Johnny Depp's ass how many pimples would you say and is a Okay best actor of all time favorite one hit wonder which horse do you think is gonna win a Kentucky Derby if they run it again? I Love that I like this we're just going in 80 million different directions as usual Which is but more so which of these people is the biggest media attention seeking a horror Michael Jackson will be on there believe me 23 votes Jesse Jackson 74 Hurald a river 39 al Sharpton 34 Steve mystery go keen 10 and colder 9 Gloria all red nine Mark Garagos 8 Johnny Cochring 8 Ellis Rubin 6 and anti grace only 6 every time we do one we put her on there for any reason She doesn't say they don't know who that is.

No, no, it was okay. I don't think you'd like it. It's just mostly shoot him up and it was all over the place Okay, I'll pass Hmm can't tell you about I'll tell you Puccino is just spastic. He's all over the place. He's either great or he is awful So bad that it's scandalous and you know there must have been a great movie for it to be as much as good as I enjoyed it Yeah, it was great because his performance was so bad, but it still didn't detract and like I said before to show and his only purpose really being there is in a beginning When he brings a Donnie Brasco into the mob as the informer, which he doesn't know and then it's a very end when he goes off to be whack because You know, he's the one in front in Johnny. It turned out to be a story that was on his ass He was one So anyway this facts is how about Michael Jackson's for days.

I'm trying to listen to the show all the phone That's okay I tuned in this weekend to your radio station there are so-called radio station I guess when it comes to weekend and I guess they're playing F.B. and radio dump on the weekend. Yes, chief right. I Well, not only that, but I mean all they're doing is every appetite is to break and stay can't generate any of their own advertisement. They're playing the EFC and spots promoting another radio station for their weak parts. I mean you know what I'm saying? Take no sense What station is that? On your radio station Maybe I'm a fear of what's on B. I know EFC and has EFC and radio up here Yeah, and I'm wondering why the hell you guys will be playing EFC and radio weekend when they're promoting their EFC and weekly line Because it's not because it's not in the same market. That's why Yeah, and I know because I used to work in Palm Beach on three years ago I know that it's just a constant ever going thing that you people are living Palm Beach think we're in the same market, but we're not I guess the Palm Beach range come out today usually you're pretty well, no, no We will I will find out We don't we don't get them unless somebody faxes it to us So if you get one poll, let us know Just smash the mediocre submit day. I'll be okay. Thanks a lot, pal. Hey, what do you say? 5 6 7 0 5 60 I mean, you know, it's one thing to be you know and the guy means well He wants us to do well, which is great. I'm not knocking him, but it's just to don't get so carried away about The interesting workings of QA especially on a weekend when nobody's listening anyway I mean you can't complain about our weekend ratings on QA because basically we don't have any The weekend is a throw away. We like trade it out. We give a few hours to mad dog to make a few bucks on Sunday and we give a few hours to this one We put Joe Rose on air just to keep him happy, you know just to keep him on a radio Just warming him up for the day when he comes in to go back in a morning show and that's it And the rest of the weekend and of course I left out of your good post friend Joe Costello How could you? Because I'm not into that auto racing stuff and then the golf show on Saturday more and it's you know, it's say it is what it is The weekend on any radio station when you come right down when I used to think I know this is silly Because I've only been in a business about 150 years or least I've heard him man Thousand yeah, but I used to think the weekend was like an image builder for radio stations because in a weekend A lot of people listen who work during the week or go to school during the weekend They listen to different day parts that they can't hear during the week. It's nice to think put something good on in a weekend little tracked people during the week see now you think it like a programmer. I see And of course there are two reasons that it doesn't happen is number one it makes too much sense in number two a cost money I mean most stations gonna pay anybody decent to work on a weekend Oh, no, we got an off-stations won't pay anybody good to work during the week so forget about the weekend forget about it Oh, it's big enough again about it. You know, it's really interesting. I mean a lot of you soprano people I'll mention any names here, but a lot of you soprano fans. I mean talk about our rip off How would you know how would I know what that's the soprano is a rip off of anything? They don't say forget about it on that show not as a rule get out in here I'm a soprano as they don't use that line forget about it Not really Feena boys he tell them truth through right I Here the sounds of you're crossing your fingers and legs and eyes. I don't know. I don't want to the prettals. Well, I don't either somebody will call in somebody will bring you out of the closet He's fudge and he's a rip off the soprano is not a rip off of Donnie Brasco That's point you're trying to I didn't I'm talking about a line one line don't get all the fence it now about the soprano Even though I don't like it. I'm not gonna watch it, but but that line they stole they stole a line forget about it In fact most people when they use their line most people are not on a soprano thing not Donnie Brasco I thought they were doing daddy Brasco. Yeah, right forget about it. Okay We're 24 love it at five 60 that that's a great scene where he's explaining it to FBI guys He's lying on a couch. He's explaining what it means Forget about it. We don't get this way the name will be Johnny deck. He's our kind of guy Okay, what are you other people say you're full of crap. Okay. Don't be picking on Johnny Even though River penis died of that the that loungie is out on the West Coast for years ago and he just got closed out again in Hollywood California that is forget about it.

Bush and by KFC Where you can get the new GOP bucket the GOP bucket is all white meat right wings in OH 29 95 When Jews attack Oh, but talk about the loser of Jews man this one facts you tell me this has got to be from somebody that ate too much a month's a bri over the past over holiday This is a crazy person says Neal Howard Dean doesn't stand a chance the Democrats will nominate Joe Lieberman Who may win if he can come up with a rational plan to the job situation who may win? Julebran okay, I mean what what is this what kind of drugs is this guy? Man, it says in the words of bill pen that you can bet on it They will nominate you Lieberman. I'll I'll take it right now. I will bet everybody's life in the world on it that they will not nominate you Lieberman The Democrats do have a death wish, but not that extreme of a death wish. I don't know about that trust me. All right, in fact This thing in Georgia and Albany Georgia that I read the story on Friday about the white prom all time Yeah, sorry report but go ahead and What did say well they were interviewing one of the um one of the planners one of the student planners for it and and his quote was While they're going to lead black people catering it so it's not like it's a race I saw man Right It's like saying well, yeah, we got black people is made so guys wrong with that. How can you say we're right? We got a black eye driving a bus So why the hell I'm not stick to rest them in the back I mean what kind of crap is that? But that's my point is he you people out there who really believe who are the looted and He meant it any rational enough to believe that this tremendous change is taking place in America and that Mississippi and the Carolinas and Georgia and all these other places that each out and the much of the rest of the country too including a lot of them in West Are so liberal now and so broadminded and so progressive and so unpredgidistant What the how are you talking about if you leave them in wouldn't have been on a battle without Gore last time in 2000 grow it one by so much that they couldn't have fixed the election and Then and you almost never I'm the only one in this country that I know of actually has the hoods But I'm the honesty that tell you that that's the truth Take a look at that electoral map again at the red states in the blue states, huh? Right and you'll discover that in the rule states man the Yahoo knows picking right wing Bible thump in states Some of which you're a nearly a you know, Gore would have a chance at and had no chance You called it from the start if you think that people who are Never mind it big and and I don't know that but you're not just talking about a Jew on a ballot who is a heartbeat away from the presidency You're talking about an orthodox Jew he didn't but he was almost enough to chase me to hell away This is a man who wears his religion on his sleeve. This is a man who's a right wing a piece of crap This is a man who's more militant to the behakthan and chicken officer running the country right now and we're gonna put him in there I don't think so But then a man crafts always find a way to do this whether was Michael Duke caucus who was a tough on crime But against capital punishment and he laughed him off the stage practically and then of course We put on there with with the watermindale Geraldine Ferraro who not only was a woman but had the a vowel at the end of her name She had a bowel movement Remember all those suspicions about her fair about her husband and those strange dealings up speaking about Pidani Brasco The Democratic Party has a death wish make no mistake about they had the ability to grasp the feet from the jaws of victory Better than any political party or any movement in the history of mankind. I really believe that They put in people who are guaranteed to lose guarantee to lose couldn't win a fixed election Here's a good fact from KR right on target. How could we have left out two of them? We want he doesn't mention This is how can he leave out the disgusting a horrid jury fall while who would practically blow someone in a parking lot for a few minutes of airtime I remember seeing him on CNN after NASA found the fossilized bacteria from Mars a few years ago What is this man? No about science to come in on fossils, but there it was on TV spreading ignorance and being taken seriously We're gonna put jury fall while and Pat Robertson on there. Beiner boy. I want to take it by vote Now this is a tough poll today 270 vote not that inspirational to be honest with all of it is a Monday.

I'm with you, KR. We'll have it on there this week sometime I would say by Wednesday when you absolutely and how many times today we're gonna play it? Not third man at least Here's a great fact that says Mr. Neil remember when you were watching bully this was based on a true story The version I saw on cable had plenty of full-fruited pubic hair nudity and and sexual scene All though much more female than male It's I guess they can tell which one is coming from with but it seems the only two things these kids had an interest in was surfing and boy That's how it did to me Since these kids were in a high school with fellas that the movie is depicting minors having sex And judging by the small titties on the main character Uh, it says I give this movie a giant thumbs up says our Palm Beach trouble maker Excellent facts. Thank you so much back to you of course all the actors are 18 and over I see so was a true story right and it happened there Right and Rachel minor the lead female she was a minor down I believe that's McCulley Coltons X-Crow front or whatever I had a mouthful of soda when you said that I'm afraid I'll over the whole damn room here I don't know why McCulley Colton leaves me sulking man Huh, Vulcan now there's something bizarre about that kid Am I right is this thing stuck this poll?

You'll be seeing something Maybe I'll go blind I think I can go here on your pulse five six seven. Oh, I saw you and speaking of Donnie Brasco You know as we had a couple of facts is including a great facts from 18 nobody in the audience has seen Donnie Brasco has any opinions on it Nobody has got a same or different opinion on Pachino's acting job, and I move see there's certain institutions that you must not criticize Right like the Catholic church and I know he's Catholic too because his name ends in a oh Like Robert denier. Oh, yeah, there's another one same thing right Excellent actor, but in some cases, I mean just pathetic He's made some movie that I wouldn't wish on Hitler and Eva Brown. I mean just some awful stuff But it's that's state of mind thing if you're lucky enough to become a state of mind No matter what you do it's beyond reproach and it has to be Worked like Picasso.

I hate that when it hops away from him Mark Garagos 10 Full ball seven or Robertson two they just went on there out of 361 votes it'd be a lot more than that being a boy if somebody wouldn't have screwed up our disc space Oh, no you fact this to me a while ago. I saw this over the weekend A while about George while is this how do you pronounce his name while or while he I had it W y I guess while I should have waited a while before putting the son of the pressing George wild died. He was 87 I guess that's old enough 400 songs that he wrote including the theme from killer design on which I'm gonna play if I can find it think I got it somewhere. Let me see No, I want the pristine to clean one not the 30 one No Just playing everything with Gilligan in front of it We got Gilligan's pot Just Gilligan.

He just not coming from the same place the same juncture as The rest of the chicken out crowd. He's neither one of them But do you think that if bush put colon Paul just as example on a yabal on the next time you think he could win? Because there would be a lot of black people that probably would vote certainly more than voters for bush last time But there'd be an awful lot of other people devoted for bush would say I don't think so Even that light complexion you'll see You'll see you folks out there that really believe America's changed all that much. Maybe there was some laws that have changed We know that Oh this crowd would like to undo a lot of those and they're working feverishly to do as many as they can Just answer it San Thor'm a hilltaya San America man five six seven oh five six.

Yeah, yeah, what I got the story we got on what the little girl handed over and it was was an improvised explosive device to do harm to the four soldiers It wasn't trying to return a piece of ordinance in fact Question from a seven year old girl Myers exactly exactly then she tried to run away after she handed it and it went off from a transcript of a Pentagon news briefing April 21 What's the punter time a long time ago an ambitious governor said Friday who would use whatever force necessary to put down anti war protesters in nearby college town That night the protests were worse with bonfires and window breaking and accusations of communist plots and police brutality five back and forth Saturday night the protesters had fired an old frame building on campus and the governor believing that communist were taking over called out the army Sunday the situation deteriorated with the anti war protesters cursing and throwing rocks at the soldiers the governor calling students forced in communist And the guards been using tear gas and bayonets to break up the crowd still most believe the situation was utter control of the protests with the mission diminished when classes started on Monday Monday knew when the soldiers inexplicably fired in the crowd of protesters and lunchbound students killing foreign-wonding nine The authorities closed down the college and forced the students to leave a local newspaper reported that large number of soldiers had been killed in that arm named dangerous rebels were still at large A strict curfew was imposed in force by arm van the helicopters a few days later inspectors searched the student residences for deadly weapons finding the上面 of steak knives starting pistols Cap gun ceremonial sorts pensing force and antique firearms high officials publicly deployed student violence that invites tragedy Many towns people justified the shootings calling the students' scuzzballs and asserting that the soldier should have killed more of them It was rumored that the protesters were controlled by communist hiding in a Soviet submarine and a local landlocked reservoir Others story circulated that the dead students were covered with ice or eaten up five in aerial disease and who would have died in a few days anyway That's my story with the personal note she says on Monday May 4, 1970 I took my five-year-old daughter to work with me instead of a kindergarten class at the Kent State University I wasn't concerned about the student protesters who shouted a lot and set some fires in the middle of the night But I was worried about soldiers with rifles on campus in the following days I tried to explain to her what happened in terms she could understand in ways that wouldn't leave her fearful and distrusting to be their students or soldiers 33 years later, I don't know why the soldiers open fire no guards min ever plenty was just following orders No officer ever stopped forward and the step forward and said either with prider shame I gave the order to fire by my authority according to such and such a protocol Name calling rumors and divisive stories still circulate around Kent a lot of energies still invested in the stories intended to make you the students or the guardsman and a good guys like the storyteller reasonable virtuous and humane or stories to prove that those people Is that the soldiers of the students were evil depraved in human bad guys and in 2003 after an unprovoked attack by the US on a small but unruly Essentially unarmed country our entire nation is fragmented by name calling rumors and divisive stories like may 4th of Kent state We have leaders convinced that those people and Marshal of deadly weapons despite events to the contrary and believe by many people Advileants was not only justified and necessary to restore order.
