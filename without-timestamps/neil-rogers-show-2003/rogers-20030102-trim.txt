903, that's our first call of the new year. We got one, not yet. Aren't you excited about that? There was one. Who was it? Somebody wanted to talk about the dolphins. They thought we could talk about the dolphin. Nice job there, baby. See, I was saying to George before the show today, this town will never ever change. And even the sports, it's neurotic repetition. 30 years now, it's been the same tired thing. This is the year. We're talking super, and as always the choke, you know? And then for days and days on end, on this radio station call after call after call. What are we gonna do? Can I ask you one thing before we start the show today, seriously? Since it's our first show of 2003, and I'm back in town, aren't we blessed down here? Huh? I mean, the heat and the panthers both won yesterday. Oh, nobody cares, of course, but they both won yesterday. The cool ones are going to win the fiesta, both are going to crush Ohio State, make no mistake about that. Ohio State said, they're not a little girls team. They're a big girls team. I'll give me at least that. But then they're not good. They just barely squeak by Michigan. Did you see the trouble of Michigan had yesterday? Oh my god. They have no defense. I don't know. We're not going to talk football. Then we'll get George involved in it. So what do we got? What's on the agenda today? We got the mad dog. No, we don't have no mad dog. What's always gellie talking about? Is he out of his mind? Let's see. Where is it? Thursday, like I said, we got the mad dog. All right. Well, I'm on the wrong goddamn day. I keep thinking this is Monday. I'm watching all those football games just didn't think it had to be Sunday. Just had to be Sunday. But you know what? See, I know how to do it. I come back on the first day of the new year and it's Thursday. So it's one of my great weeks. A Thursday and Friday two days on two days off. That's where I like it. That's the new American work schedule boys and girls. You work one day and you have the rest of the goddamn week off. That's the way we're going to do it in 2003. You work one day at a month. You have the other 30 days off for 29 whatever the hell month it is. That's the way we're going to start doing it. Forget about this work ethic crap. Okay. Pay us a lot of money and don't expect too much in return. Have we got our first call of the year from four a lot of day? How do you do this? Hello. Four. Oh, yes. I just had to be first. How are you? Okay. This is the same guy that always is the first one. Even though you're doing a different voice than it. Oh my god. No, I know. I know you're the guy. Yeah, I'm the guy. We can do any voice in the world. I know it's you. Pretty exciting. I'm back here, huh? We are so happy to have you back. Why is that? I mean George is good because Miss Right now I don't mean on the year. I'm back in town. You're better. I'm I'm I'm backing pleasurable with the rest of us. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm not miserable. The Patriots won. Yeah, even though we didn't make the playoffs. That's not the important thing. We got our ring last year. We don't care about that. Just knock in the dolphins out watching them choke and and oh god. It was a wonderful thing for me. Bless town. Are we blessed on here? Welcome back, my children. Thank you so much. And have a great new year. Thank you. Bye bye. I think we're going to be a lot of calls today and by the way, just wanted to tell you right off the bat. Right off the get go right at the box. Okay. How come the levels on this mic are so fast? Everything's. Huh? Different and bizarre. It couldn't be because nobody's working here. You see. I don't want to feel bad because I had and it wasn't that I took an extra vacation I just took two weeks at one time plus the usual days that I had offer Christmas in New Year's et cetera And that's all because there's no ratings going on during that time. Of course, we don't have any ratings anymore anyway. This last year. I'll take part of the blame for that try to change the world and I do want to run on the box Also talk about that bitch that called your John. What they was that Tuesday? I guess who's they? I'd like to have somebody bring that bitch into this studio. Tie her up in a chair and I'll personally take a baseball bat and crush your skull from that I'll want to clock until I have to leave. I will. See, I hardly listen at all when I'm not on the year including all of these holidays and everything even though I have the ability and throughout or listen I think here the one morning that more ran two minutes over and we'll get back to moment and a moment and a moment Yeah, we'll get momentarily we'll get back to my good close personal friend. Mo and by the way also mo I'm not going to be worried any new wardrobe although this is a new shirt, but not because of the fact that he had anything to say about the way I dress Take a look at the way the other people are dressed with I don't come to work here in a pretentious way to try to impress the people I'm working with they know I'm a fat old slob who makes a lot of money. I can buy whatever clothes I want And that's his comeback a guy that leaves the house wearing a guy damn to pay that's fallen off the side of his head The dresses to the health come on to do a radio show. That's called vanity and if there's one thing that I'm not it's vain Okay, I could have my Chuck Alphiari phony here on here. I can have like a $2,000 Brooks Brothers suit right so good time. Yeah, so tie made in Italy Who the hell's gonna see it? It's a freaking radio show you moron. Oh, that's right there. I'm still his material. He said moron Now what was I saying before about the new year if if you know how to spell it. I do know how to spell it HJRG I thought about the bitch I'd like to be with a baseball bat So I come in I had a coming here Tuesday was I'm not gonna burden the audience because a lot of people out there are making a lot of money And they say gee don't complain about your checks but not be on time at least you're making all that money in your right You're right. I'm making a lot of money. It's a good scam. Okay I'll be the first one would minute and I'll take it But I had to go through another bigger moron to get my check because the pony got sick between here and Naples before Christmas and the package didn't get here And poor moth had to get on the phone with Naples and it went I don't know where my go through the story because nobody would believe it. I went to Memphis and then the package went to Dallas and then finally went back to Naples And they signed the check and I had to come in Tuesday and pick it up. Okay So I leave Tuesday to go to Mommy's house for lunch and by the way, don't let me forget also to talk about my mother today at length that bitch Do you know what I discovered when I walked into her house? I because I was here early Okay, I got an early start a couple of errands to run I had to come in here pick up my check and I was supposed to go to her house at noon for lunch I show up there 10 after 11. I'm early So she still got the hamburgers. You don't really brown your ground brown. Yeah, she still got him cooking on a stove And as her last touch which I've never seen this before She reaches in her cupboard and she pulls out two humongous gigantic containers One well first of all two of them. Now let me ask you what are the two ingredients the two things I always talk about that don't dissolve in your body Pepper and paprika right what do you think of any two containers George? Serving salt no wait pepper and paprika good guests and she's shaking on there She's got the burgers in his fry pan on a stove She put enough pepper and paprika on here to sink the goddamn Korean army. I'm telling you right now And I'm thinking of myself aha now it explains why I always have the Blue apple which that girl. Oh my god This this is her way she is and forget about your mother. She's not even in a running my mother is the most evil person on the face of the earth Who's main goal in life? You know what everybody's got a hobby some people stand collecting whatever Her hobby is finding fault. Oh, yes, we should put them both in a pit finding at the fault That's my mother's favorite hobby everybody's imperfect accept her But anyway, so I leave here to go to my mother's house. You know something like back and up on this bitch And I make the mistake and I'll tell you this I got back Sunday morning from Toronto The whole time I never turned on this station. I listen to FM and believe me. Oh God FM is just as bad as ever it is down in blows even with that new What's the new callators WMIB men in black? I don't even know anyone Used to be radio a smeg months to 85th time they changed the format. I got a little mong let me get to the Amsterdam's through eventually Don't go to Amsterdam. You'll hate it Did I start on this after last summer? It's not like I'm making a sudden turnaround Did I start last summer? It's only that I think I was burned out. I'm totally burned out Amsterdam blows So anyway turn the radio on over to George The first caller is the crank guide. It's given you a son of the answer about the Cubans. You know though I'm talking about of course. Okay, after him is a guy that would give any of song in a dance about Well, you know, it is true what you say, but the Republicans at least when they were in office the market is pretty good And I'm thinking to myself what what will be Republicans is he talking about Herbert Hoover? Yeah, it must be Herbert Hoover. Why don't we get in his depression? Or maybe it was George Herbert Walker motion his recession or maybe the current one with a markets in the crap or And then comes this woman You know, we don't get a lot of women callers on this show But the ones that we do get they are very Namorable they may not have big memories, but they are very memorable precious and few oh God and This bitch this mother scratching bitch She goes in with thing and our poor whole purpose of her call was to suck up to you and her rip me because I wasn't here Seriously suck up. She's sucking George's brown crack. I mean heavy duty So to speak Suck in sucking sucking All and you can go on the dial from one end to the other and you never hear this kind of thing And you're the only voice out there and then George to his credit because he's sucking around too Because he's hoping he's gonna get that birthday check this week. Maybe next week. I'll think about it And anyway, no, yeah, just think you should have seen I'm in Duff's office on Tuesday waiting for my check He's got his on the phone. He's got my checkset and honestly, but I want to grab it And a couple people stop by and hey Neil welcome back nice to see George comes in her and sees me grabs me like his long lost His hug me so hard and he almost squeezed the crap out of me Yeah, the crap full of crap. He's waiting for that birthday check I was figured I wasn't gonna get it. I'm still happy to see you. Yeah, no, you're not I love you So anyway, she starts going on about how well Because George says Neil talks about these same things two and really tries to inform the public I went through seven or eight months of these periodicals on audio I feel like self-destructed right here on a goddamn radio I'm reading 50,000 periodicals on the internet every day and getting up at three o'clock at a goddamn morning I'm spending half of my life to try to change the world here like a lunatic And this bitch has got the host bunch. He says to George why do you have it? He says nobody really cares isn't that just a cop out? Is it too much work for him? Is that what it is? It's too much work? They don't care. I understand that they don't but when she said that is it too much work At that point I wanted to get my Louisville slugger from Ted Williams and just bashed her brains out if I could find it Maybe just Yeah, take the bat and stick it up your ass lady. Okay You miserable nasty hostile bitch and I'll say it again 80% of the women in South Florida are the worst I'm a face of the earth and that's being generous See I can afford to say that cuz we only got about a one-shier so I got I got a lot of leeway there, you know I got a scoosh of leeway in my jean. Are you gonna blow off the female audience? We don't have any female audience In fact based on our last trend there it looks like we don't end the you've sports nerds. You're not fooling me I've been around a block too many times the November trend which I won't even go to the numbers November trend the sports day parts even moan up A little bit now he went up to like a four-eight men. I think that's his biggest number since he's been there Of course I'd include nine to ten so he may have like a four-shier not too great Especially for him that was before he picked up Patriots to beat the Adolfi He's finished But at any rate so the sports are the Hank went way back up there But we took a hit didn't go way down but the fact that they went up in that month and we went down That tells you the sports nerds got the diaries in November and we took it you want to know mainly why why Electrical oh same thing in 2000 look back in the in the fall book in 2000 you're right those right winners They're pissed off and fired up all the way. We'll say this At the same time that I'm telling you it's gonna be mostly fun and games on his show this year with a few You know new Zephyr articles thrown in there now and then like I have today Although we have much better stuff from the period from the of tambourids today But if anybody thinks that when our sucked George Bush and his merry band of little Nazis asses this year I hate to break the news to you but wrong wrong not gonna happen Not gonna happen Just a thought of it just the fact that he still maintains this incredible popularity When we're on a verge of like having an North Korean solace they're gonna blow up the guy name We'll keep in mind that these were the same people The same people when a first came into office didn't care about the rest of the world until 9.11 We were gonna become Papy Canon's favorites isolationists We didn't care about them at least we didn't care about this one now all we cared about was that oil pipeline We were working on Afghanistan with the Taliban Those were our partners Like how men rod said you know our partner And these were the same barbarians that we were excoriating just months later because of the brookers that the women had aware And a man had to shave the beard and they couldn't listen to music and all of these terrible things that they were doing But they were our partners until that fell through until 9.11. I don't want to go back to you it because I'm not gonna change the world How are Ben and J.Lo doing if you want to lick some bush go right ahead be my guest, okay? I can see I'm gonna have this thing start up again I'm gonna have to get that lovac win Does that what it was that I took? I don't remember do we have any of our detail men out there any of our pharmacy people? I'm gonna have to get some drugs. We do Moses. Oh Can he give me that hey Moses?

Okay, here's the appell result from George's poll lady took last time he was there when it was last time Here like two days ago Tuesday the day that it heard on a way to mommy's house Maybe that bitch will call back him, but I sure doubt it the one that says I'm too lazy Boy, see that and that goes to show you that's to me more.

Oh, it's a conf out. He's doing like nobody cares lady. This is an entertainment show It's a radio program. We're not gonna change the world on the neo-rod you show Which the rest of the station don't even recognize that we're here by the way Don't even get a mention anymore. Even my good friend a mad dog You know the transition remember when we used to be on tenditude and we have the transition with Hank. Oh, yeah, and it was there was not always a crossover But there was at least on his part a recognition that I existed whatever we just did.

I've got a thoughty like a driving range man When it's cold outside, use my nips to hang your head. I can blow in your ear and give you a lap dance, but you won't notice me to like get some implants. I need a guy who, in got issues, like feeling up a chest, and find in tissues. What? Guys, they're cute. They're same fruity. I'm the one who needs your pitty. I've got a nice end, and they're like a kissy, but I can't get a man. Because I got no titties. I don't today. Because Wonder of God is something I can't afford. When you lay on me, you'll swear you're on a diving board. When I turn the lab in, I started to get used. Now I'm 24, and still waiting on my boots. I'm the one who needs your pitty. I've got a nice end, but I can't get a man. Because I've got no titties. I don't today. I've got no titties. I've got no titties. I've got no titties. I've got no titties. I don't today. So I have a cool video for you, Frank Saffa, that sounds like? No, that's because you still don't know what it is. Somebody will call it a tummy. You sure you don't know what that is? Positive. Although I could listen to all the albums I'll over again. 928 and 560 WQN happy New Year 2. This is our first show of 2003. And we're pretty damn pumped up about it, aren't we? No, nobody's in the building. Because there's still on a busman's holiday. I can't stand people to take too much time off. There's anything that makes me nauseous, man. Makes me really fired up and pissed off. Here's our poll today on TheORGers.com. Which we better get that response at our pollback up there again. That's still also badly when George was doing those bad polls. This is not a good poll today. It's not one of my really a column. But then, it's timely. What's your New Year's resolution this year? Lose weight, quit smoking, have a lot more sex. Not take any crap, quit bruising, or New Year's resolutions are for assholes. So speaking of assholes, getting back to mold for a moment. Have you noticed that everything that he does and says? That's totally unacceptable within the boundaries of human behavior. Everything he denies. Here's a man in denial. And even the call that he had from the guy Mitch, that I've played at the beginning of the show, he never denies having the beast fired. Where did you get your information? Where did you get it? Must be from the train monkeys, but he never really comes out and denies it because he can't deny it. Because it's true. Nobody else got to beast off that show, Mo. Show, Mo. That's what I told Miguel last time I was in here. Why don't you show Mo and he zipped up his pants or my not a here? Maybe that was all he had to show. Come on. When you're going to fess up to it, Mo and stand up. Just like the thing about, would bury Jackass's column and Joe Rose. And by the way, don't be picking on our good friend Joe Rose. Okay, because he at least used to promote the show. And mention our real names, not this ginger, Freda Stair, Guava eating, spit whatever this stuff is, you know? Mo. So anyway, Barry Jackson and Saturday's paper writes a comment about how Mo, I'll pick the, uh, knowing with the beat Miami, but also said that the dolphins would sneak in the playoffs anyway, so we was half right. But, you know, this guy's a any called Harvey Green. The dolphins, senior vice president of media relations, Howard called us to say was picking against this tongue and cheek, kidding me, making it come at about people field on here. Right. Keep in mind, this is a man on the payroll of the dolphins. He gets paid by the team to do their games. I think the only cheek that he had his tongue and was somebody's echo. That's what I think. See, maybe that's your rumour that we get in the hallway in a morning see the veterans his hairpiece. And let me also ask you this, how come he claims that I wear the same clothes every day? When he's only seen me three times since he came here eight months ago. How's that possible? He's got extra vision. I see, is that it? I mean, we all can't be a fashion plate like Mo. But if anybody thinks that there's any room for accommodation between Mo and yours, truly the answer is absolutely no chance, none. Zero, less than none. That will never happen. That Wednesday morning and remember it was a couple days we thought that maybe he was coming around a little bit. He was starting to promote the show a little circuit, which is fine. Okay, have a good time. You know, we give it out. You give it back. That's fine. But at one Wednesday morning, I'll never forget it. I'm up there and to where we spend an hour and a half on a story. So obscure that we couldn't, it took us about four hours to find it on the internet. About the Oregon ducks. And the station that carries their games out of there in Portland or wherever it is. And about some syndicated talk show that I never even heard the guy before. And he's a racist, he's this and he's desperately trying somehow to bring that back to me again. And another and another stork. Another attempted drive to show it in all the station. Yeah, then maybe we can all have numbers like you, Mo. Okay. Low rhymes with Mo. So since that day, that was the end. I gave him about what 85 chances to let come and join the human race. Join the team here at QAM. Refuse to do it. And now he's picking on the in Buries, column, pod, poor Joe Rose. So his rose said that he was sick when he heard, in fact several calls also suggested was inappropriate for the teams play by playing outside a thick against the whole team. It's childish to make an issue of it. And if Joe Rose wasn't doing it, it took and she said, I'm disappointed in Joe Rose David said, he's disappointed in everybody. We're all bad. He's good. You understand the way it works? He's a good guy. We're all about to ask holes. Okay. That's the way it is. And Chloe, including you, especially you. You little quava loving spick. That was wrong with you. So, and I also want to say this. This is the new year. Okay. People do make resolutions. I've put it this before on a year. I'll tell you again. And this is the MS. I will not speak to. I will have nothing to do with that creature. Okay. If I see him in a hallway coming in the morning, while I'm here, these couple of months. I'm not going to speak to him. He doesn't exist. He only exists in terms of discussion on this program, which there will be plenty. But in terms of a physical being, there will be none. He doesn't exist. And if you had any self-respect, I've put it this before. He tried desperately, feverishly, psyched, to get your little aspired. Right after your wife had that unwanted second little kid no less. Could have destroyed your whole freaking life. Could have put you out on the beach. Where'd you go to get a job? Next to it, BPMical? Maybe? I doubt it. I can make coffee. They said I got enough spits. They're already in need some more shfartures. I got ink. I like that. And it's a good thing I stopped by this morning. Get my sodas, my dyed coax. Because the cover here is bare. Hey, PD, what flavors you want? You jackass, you leather lung asshole. He makes me red rough and sore. That guy. I'll tell you that right now. PD, Lenny. So here's a guy that tried to get you fired. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. How's it going to go? Game is rolling, fighting for it. All right. uploaded azul difference, two times I guess. ok. It's free, it's dark, one touch and only look second need. That's a good guy, fucking75. Access, acquire, render and hit the a train. Some help Christ up quickly to Miracles.

Let me say it again, since you're probably on a way into work right now based on what you told me on Tuesday. I say I we have to do everything on the year because there's nobody to talk to here. Clarence is out there to be as the bowl and temp p. Trying to get laid which ain't gonna happen by the way, Clarence. That's sad. I mean he's not he's not a well maybe the fact that he's hung like a fruit fly that might have something to do with it. Have you ever wondered about that? Like I'm always talking about the Chinese there's a billion Chinese when a guy's got a penis like a I mean makes me feel like a real man. Well how do you know that? Like the that's the what the Chinese? No, Clarence. Because he told me. I see. Just like any month. Just like in week a past member that. If he passed the message, I think through you through somebody. He passed it through you and you didn't even feel it. Because he said he's hung like a net and a same with Clarence. When you know I mean so maybe he's gonna get to like second base maybe halfway between second and third base certainly not home plate any chance. No. But the fact that he's got a teeny teeny tiny penis. How do I how's he what's he gonna do with it? What are you gonna do with it, Clarence? Never slowed me down. Or you also have a small penis? Well it's in proportion with the revenue. So what is that? Oh mind's not. Oh and also let me take it this. Sometimes you see the I've told you this before these big tall guys you think but it must be hung like a moose. You know? Not necessarily not necessarily. I've discovered that in my travels. So anyway getting back to a travels and Amsterdam man. What a what a what a ranch he placed at his. You know that old expression about it's a nice place to visit but you wouldn't want to live there. Absolutely correct sir. Right. And I know a lot of people are gonna give me crap. That's alright. I'm prepared. I'm moving in with the railions. We're getting on a goddamn spaceship with with Leonardo. And we're going we're going back to your remas. You get one of those outfits with the shoulder pads. And is this incredible or what I see this story and I'm watching his food cake on TV. Of course in Hollywood of course. Because everything every bizarre, grotesque unacceptable thing has has to come back to this Florida. And here's this fruit cake on there with that with that thing in the middle of the back of his head. Whatever the hell you call that thing. Hop not. That that not. Maybe he's kind of done not. Not. But anyway and then in the media all these all these people these ethicists. They're having a risk breakdown and we're discussing the ethics. First of all, we see any baby. Do we have any data? No. We have any scientific evidence. No. And they're talking to a guy who even aren't vellin put him on. And here that's how ridiculous this guy is. The aliens. Yeah. First we had alien. Now we've got aliens. God. By the way, nice going there David Ross. Just we need another hip hop station. Hip hop hop on this. You idiot. He also lied about that. Somebody was telling me to stir about how he told the rumors were leaking about how they were going to make the big format change. And then like right around Christmas time, they came by. They were they played all that. What do they play? Christmas music? I don't remember. And supposedly after the Christmas holiday, they were going to come back out with a new format. And it came back out with the same old radio smuggler. Whatever that was that they were playing. Anybody know what it was? No. Because that's how they had no audience. And so he told everybody see no change. It was all just a big lie. So we clated. They fired everybody and we got the new hip hop. W. M. I. B. Men in black. You know how long that's going to last? Just like when vaccinated into the ladies channel, what do we want to they call it? The, I don't know, plan it something. Compliant it. Very good. And this is the station that used to be she used to be rocket roll man used to be the Primo FM in his town. 103.5 of fixture. And I you know what they've done the same thing to that on FM that they've done the INZ on AM. They've turned it into pure on a dollar-rated crap. Two of the formerly most premier stations in a market. Only queer channel could do that. I'm sorry, Mo. Cloudy channel. Cloudy channel. Sorry. I forgot his fabulous sense of humor. Well, seriously, if you speak to him again, that's it. I don't want to like be bush boss, but you're just, in fact, just tell everybody you're not allowed to speak to him. You're not allowed to speak to the molemeister. It'll be, and the same goes for Carlos and he's laughing. But I'm not laughing. If you want to more those big pages come pouring through there, baby. But I'm not speaking to the enemy. Well, sometimes he's a captive audience. What he's in the bathroom shaving, you know, coming and doing some business. Well, you know what I would do? I would take the guy name, raise a re-trait over and give that hairpiece a shot with it. Yeah. Is it real or is it a mammarex? You jackass, you silly old goat with the bad vera cosvane. Here's a guy that goes on and plays golf in public with a poking out shorts and his vera cosvane's flailing out and his damn hairpiece flowing into wind falling on a guy damn, he didn't put the ball in a hole, but his hairpiece is in there. Yeah, they thought that it was a ferret. Crawl to the guy damn hole on the 18th green turn out it was most hairpiece. And he's talking about the way that I dressed in my appearance. That would be like my call somebody fat. Fat boy, which we'll get to in after the break. Oh, I got so much catching up to do. You know, plus we're going to take a lot of calls today. Lot of calls. Here's a good one from sunrise. Hello. How are you doing? Great. How are you doing? Welcome back. Happy New Year. I was actually at a couple questions, but you got to go on this topic now. I'm going to ask you two things about how we're David. Who? Mohour, David, a non-existing guy. He's an asshole. Yeah. Number one, I don't understand how you're going to wear a couple of things. Number one, remember when you were doing the forget about it Friday and he told people call in, spy about your neighbor, tell him your neighbor, tell him. Yeah. I've heard that how big deal was it made about that. I mean, it can't get in trouble for that. Beats me. And then the second thing is also don't forget the thing when he went on with Tony Bruno and he also lied his way out of that about he didn't check the affiliate list. And then he turns around and tells the guy, he listens to him every day. Why would he have to check the affiliate list if he knows what's stationary's on the listener every day? I've been the second thing. He lies his way out of every one of his previous little games. That couple weeks he's been ripping a restaurant, buying name in Boko. Not New York Prime. No, it was like the Antonio. I don't know. Well, they probably didn't give him a freebie, just like New York Prime. But I mean, he's not ripping him. He's saying stuff about it like the kitchen, things like that. Really? I cannot believe these people are not like Apple Hucket. It's all over him. I would, if I were in that restaurant, I would be so in his ass. I'll play right now. Maybe all of them like stick on Mo. How does he get away with this stuff? I don't know. And then nothing just went out to Tampa for the Michigan Bowl game. Again? That's four days. And I know you. Pull and weed wack around. It's a sack you nuts, so bowl. What was that? Something about like that. But I know you want to talk to that game. I know you want to Michigan State, but I saw the Michigan cloud was there. And you'll, there is not one good looking girl from Michigan. I mean, there wasn't one. Well, how about good looking guys? Other than Tom Brady's, the first good looking guy ever came out of that university. New York, how could, how could that's mad dog? He'll tell you how could any guy want to go to college or Michigan these girls were ugly. Hey, there are a lot of hot babes in Michigan State, baby. We're there. That's why they got to good football team. I'm busy playing football. Michigan State were busy playing with balls. OK? Got more important things to worry about. Hey, New York, I just want to say, you know what? I know you don't want people to suck up to you, but listen to you for about 15 years. You're the greatest. I am. I'm glad you're back. Thanks a lot, pal. Thanks for the suck job. Have a great new year. You too. Bye-bye. Yeah, it's the first day of the new year. So I can suck all you want. That's what the Pope said. Oh, do you see that? That's even more good news. Not only have they got this tremendous shortage of priest, but now that they're saying no facts in a priesthood, that's going to finish off the Catholic church. This service is anymore. Isn't that good news? Yeah, but they'll do something. What are we going to do with all that hardware? You know, the hats and the miters and all the chains and the beads and all that all the, all the chotch keys? Wow. Maybe they'll have a yard sale. That is so heavy, doody. Oh, as a matter of fact, in the movie 40 days and 49th his brothers a seminary student. So he goes in the confessional confessional brothers on the other side and they keep opening the slide and the thing back, you know? And his brother, he walks in on his brother 20 into the movie. And his brothers get in on with a nun. He said, oh, well, I'm dropping out in a couple weeks anyway. It's kind of a cute movie. It's basically a movie about Josh Hartnett and his penis. 16 till 10. Well, that's what it's about. It's a movie about this young, horny guy and his penis is what it is. We never get to see it though. Sixth time won't be watching it again. 16 till 10 at five, 60 WQM on a great Thursday man. What a good thing. Good timing on my part. See at least I come back today. It's that the holidays are over. Our staff here hasn't learned that yet. The holidays are over boys. Get with it. The new year is here. You ask holes. You slackers. Even more late here today to greet me on my first day back. Let me say again, if you ever see me speak to him, I want you to go on a year and out me right on a year. Cause it'll ever happen. Haven't you ever had anybody in your life that you just made up your mind? You will never speak to them? Yeah, but then she keeps calling back. Oh, your mother. Right. Hey, ma. No more paprika, ma. Yeah, the hemorrhoid inducer. My mother. Seriously, if I can't, I can't over. I can't exaggerate the amount of black pepper and paprika. She just took the shakers and just poured them like with all of her energy. Like it was unbelievable. Like a rainstorm of black pepper and paprika on his poor little uh, brown browns. Hey, moss and she's always lying. Oh, I never put anything in there. It's just crowdsurled. I never put anything in that right. Hemorrhoid inducer. That's what you are, ma. Hemorrhoid inducer in more ways than one. Nip ticker, nagger. Finding fault. Everything I do is wrong. Everything everybody I know does is wrong. And everything you do is right. Two bad we can't all be slim like my mother. Oh, you're so fat. You get so much weight, fat lady. And she's bringing out the 17 courses for lunch. You look like you lost weight. Since I was here last, no, I gained back some of the way to loss. You're quite a bit of it. Huh. That's going to change now. Oh, look at to the weight part after the break. And we're going to talk about our break. And you notice how he hasn't shown his fat face in here yet today. He hasn't waddled in here. What's he doing like the walker or wheelchair? Walker. Or if they got him on, I'm one of those gurneys. It's a walker, but they're wheels on it. I think they're going to bring him in on a gurney now. And that we want to what I'm going to state to put him on there. That's your blue etiquette right out of the water, which is probably just as well. I really do in two breaks. We're going to do three. Okay. Not two. I'll tell you when I get her. What are you worried about? We got so much time to show stuff around. Don't worry about it. We got no spots that it assails department. You know, they went on a 20 day holiday. I cannot stand people to take too much time off. I hit it. When you're getting paid to do a job, you show up every goddamn day. You get a couple of days here. They are too over there. Not me, because I'm an old fart. I paid my dues. I should get off like 90% of the time. And I like to get off. So like I said, what time's Moses coming in? Hey, listen, I've been back here now four days. I'm starting a little bit horny. Oh, Cam and it's so Florida. This is the most sexless place on the face of the earth. You just even see anybody that looks good that you'd want to do it with. I mean, you look around. Is there anything alive here? Is there anything under the age of 100? Oh, God. 54 votes on our poll.

Lose weight 17, quit boozing five. Don't take any crap three. Quist smoking one. Did you get a hold of Moses? I'm trying. He's got to bring me my stuff. Huh? Am I drugs, too? Come on, Moses. Let's get with it sweetheart. We'll must have some other contacts. Ah, because I feel this thing coming back on. Which gets me back on. Oh, there's my good friend, Moth. Like I said, you better give it those engineers in the figure out what they want to do that equipment. Because I'm not going back. What's gives me back to Amsterdam? What, what, what, I'll pit? What a toilet. As a tourist, it's fine for a few days. You go over in a summertime or in a spring when it's tourist season. But even this last summer, I noticed after 9.11, the number of tourists there weighed down. Now, this year, going over there at Christmas time, which I had done before, and was pretty good, there were almost no tourists. So what does that leave you with? The Dutch F. Oh, my God. Who now wants to be hanging out with a bunch of Dutch people? Other Dutch? I don't think so. Root, obnoxious, pushy, nasty. And that apartment, am I? You'll notice that I got a little bit of the cough back in the year. They're raspiness. The same milder and mold and crap. So I was able to sleep. I was there for 10 days. Never slept in my bed, which all the bedrooms are in a basement. Once, nobody in what a brain makes bedrooms in a basement, especially in a 10th World country like Holland. Okay, Peter, you idiot? And so I slept here in the night in the couch. I don't want to tell you about the big soul in the dance I had with the satellite dealer. Instead, well, I don't want to go through it. They see Americans coming 100 miles away. All they want to do is rip off Americans, and they do a good job of it. So I finally decided, I'm getting out of this pit. This place is crap. I hated it. And I make a rest plane reservation to go back to Toronto. And the last night that I'm there with my luck, I may have been doing so great. Thanks to Dr. Hamft. For months now, I've been doing no, no scratching is even with the cold weather in Toronto and Amsterdam. Oh, and another thing about Amsterdam, when it's 30 degrees in Toronto, and it's not windy, it's not bad. You're dressed for it. You got it. You know, heavy-conna. It's not for not a problem. But then bother me in the least, but 30, 32, 28. When it's 30 in Amsterdam, it's a humid 30 because of North C. I guess. And it's that wet and windy, just kind of, it's like being back and he's lancing again. Oh, it just goes right through your body. Man. So that's another reason not to go there, especially this time of the year. Boas. So the last night, I wake up 3 in a morning with a scratchy throat. After all these months, they're doing so great, not having, you know, the sign-in sign-in picture, which is what I had before. And that's exactly where I got it in that pit, in that sewer, and that damp mill-the-weed dank apartment. See, one thing about being over there, or in a lot of these 80-80 world, 80-first world countries, anybody can be a landlord. You got a piece of property? Sure, Schmire much of stuff together. Here's an apartment. How much can I rip you off for it? That's why it works. Now, you didn't talk about that L Goldstein thing on a year, did you? Yeah, I read the story. You talked about your good friend, L Goldstein on this program? I read the story. Oh, you didn't just have a birthday, did you? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. What we still got that damn thing pending, you know what? I know, it's actually him. I just thought that the him and his big upnuckious mouth verbatim, right? You missed the picture in a sun-sonnolo, yeah, I did. Look like somebody stuck two bicycle pumps up his ass, and just had a field name, a less 600 pounds, start naked, which he was shirtless in his picture. Oh my God, don't look at it at breakfast time, folks. And he had his king. He had an his gold slipper and his king. It was lovely, Al. It was a beautiful thing. Maybe Al would like to take my new apartment over there and if he ever gets his passport back, we'll let it happen. No, no. Because now he's also getting sued by one of his ex-wife, the same harassment lawsuit that he got from the, uh, do you remember when they sent him to write his island? Well, send you flowers, Al. Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Hello. Miami is gone. Shame on you. Here's for Laudredale. Hello. Happy June here. Back to you. Hey, I didn't, I couldn't help but noticing that you described two people the exact same way this morning. I was wondering what the chances of work, the moist and the hook up with your mom. Oh, man. It's made in heaven. I love it. Maybe she can smear some paprika on his back though, and wig. Oh, that would get never get talking to one of them. Okay. Thanks. That sounds good to me. 560560. Well, I tell you we're going to tremendous response here. My first day back after this long hiatus, long vacation, the first day of the new year. We're going to respond. Oh, for what? Let's talk about the dolphins, huh? We love the dolphins. Come on. Let's go. Panthers are only four points out of first place. Anybody care about them? No. But that was a coma inducing game again yesterday. God was that bad. Where's that great dolphin saw? Oh, yeah. Let's hear it. Come on. As you may, the greatest football team. We'd sing for you. Yeah. We take it and stick it down our throat. In their case, it's called choke. Some of the rest of us do that. It's called something else when they do what it's called choke and gag. What's sometimes we might? 560560. Come on. Wake up this town. The earlier job. Maybe wake up these dead bastards. He wanted your raspy throat. Where's my drugs, God damn it? Here's for Latterdale. Hello. Yeah. Is this going to be an ongoing thing with you and Howard? Oh, no. It's Reverend Jones again. Oh, no. Oh. Oh. Only one thing I want to say to you, you jackass, okay? Yeah. Reverend Jones, it took less than an hour before we got one of our favorite. He's okay. How is the baseball cap? What? Dick Finder said you look like a jackass, but we'll take your money. We'll take anybody's money at Pompid O Park. By the way, did you mention Tuesday? They were open in the Tuesday night for racing on New Year's Eve? Yes. Did you? Yes. Oh, you had a spot? Yeah. Good. Nice one. There's Steve. Well, they're doing it, baby. I was there Monday night with Fat Rich and Derek. My good friends. I haven't even told the Fat Rich story yet. Came with him about a curly little hero of death, I would say. Lost all of that way. He looks like a different person now. Looks kind of like a medium fat old Jew. Fly and local. Here's Sports Video 560's You A. You A.M. Anyway, Muth just came in and said, Howard David's bitch. The beach of South Florida. This is the rhythm at beat. You miss out on, with the beach of South Florida. Especially when you leave in the face. We've got a touch there that's nowhere to be heard. Even if you can't touch, you see, you'll dig up the South Florida. If the P-Lack of those damned, you'll drag the throw across the garbage can away. They don't dig it up. And the beating of South Florida, you're doing it. There's the beat, the South Florida. It's not with the sun burned home, your brain. And drink your bones. Death Florida. That's with me. I'm in the state by the way. It's only an hour out of the show already made the first mistake right down on your little daily planner there. The old man of a stake in 1001 on the first year of the year. Because I meant to say Muth said, Howard David's a bitch. There you go. I played a wrong one. Sorry about that. Don't do it again. 99 votes on the poll. What's your new year's resolution is year? And 42 people, which is 42.4% said. New year's resolutions are for asshole. Absolutely correct. Have a lot more sex 23, lose weight 20, quit boozing 7, don't take any crap 5 and quit smoking 2. And Georgia's new year's resolution is the girl little pair. Just a little. Just a little teeny tiny pair. That first at least become almost visible. At least you can feel them. If you reach around, keep searching, you can feel that they're there. That's a start. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Oh, you just think? Sounds like you. Oh, how you doing? Good. Happy New Year, too sir. Thank you sir. I listened to every day the reason I called is I was so happy to hear you talk about Howard B. I named this morning. Yeah. Does he have a contract there? Yes. How long? How much longer? I don't know too long, whatever it is. That's what I keep saying. I used to listen from a six o'clock on. I now listen from nine o'clock on. I was a goldie there by himself. Yeah, he was there by himself this morning. You was speaking pretty good this morning. Man, oh, why would I mean, I've heard some egos before, but this guy is really, I think the two words you're looking for is here are pompous ass. Those are the words you're looking for. Pompous ass. If you look up pompous ass, the dictionary, you see most hairpiece. Next time. Thank you. That's all. I had to say I was just wondering how much longer it's contract. Those are how much longer I got to put up with his group. He just turned 86. So he might not be around too long. Happy New Year, pal. See you. Five, six, seven. See people in live out there age. You won't tell you how old they are. People are wear hairpieces. People are talking about how other people dress. Who come into a radio show dressed up like, you know, like Austin Burke. I mean, what is that all about? Huh? I mean, like Johnny Versace. Johnny. How's Johnny doing? It's in him lately, huh? Don't see him no more. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, ponds, 5, 60. You notice how that bitch hasn't called in yet? Let's have some women calling in. Let's get our first lady of the year. What do you say? This is a very important show when it's the first show of the year, right? I'm all fired up. I had a nice holiday there. I had a good time, especially after I got out of Amsterdam. It's a pit. It's a toilet. You know, I'm the first one to tell you. I made a mistake. I was all those years on the year. Telled everybody how great it was. And not only that. But maybe it's because of the lack of tourists. But they've really let the middle of the time of the red light district. Which really, that's a bad term because it's like the central part of the town. And they've let it go to hell. So for all of the roster drug dealers they had before they must be multiplying. They must be snapping about in the factory. So when I was like 10 times more than they're used to be. And they're just all over the place and they're in a smell and they're scrubbing. They're just too many freaks. Okay. See before when they're all a tourist there, you didn't mind the freaks because they were in a small minority. And so you laugh and you chuckle. I look at that. But now they're the majority. You know, it's like going to overtime. Looking for white people. It's just, it's not going to happen. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon. Wireless line. Board sure is good. And I really do. I am glad to be back briefly. I was going to walk. I don't want over do it. Why? Yeah. To pick up the check. And to make out a few a sign a few checks. What else? How to go to the track? Make my, make my presence known there. Visit mom. Visit mom. Get some of her ground brown burgers with lots and lots of pepper and paprika. And then during the course of our lunch, she starts. She starts sipping whatever she's gotten her glass. And it's lemonade. And she says, Oh, I can't think that makes me gagging. She runs right in the toilet. She runs right into her bathroom. I don't even know what else she was. I can only imagine what she was doing in there. And I said, lemonade is nothing but acid. My, it's how acidic. And last time I checked, we weren't how acidic. But you know, it's one of those things where you know it's going to hurt you. But you do what so you can stretch about it. Follow what I'm saying. You know it's going to be bad for you. But you do it because it gives you something to bitch about. Right, ma and my right. Here is Miami. Hello. Hey Mr. Rod. Yes sir. Mr. Car. How you doing? Listen, that F.O.B. should stop. I don't fry, man. Look. Take the pictures on the air to beat the dog. Who's that? Mo Howard. Mo Howard. Yeah. More to the dog. Because what the hell he's doing? Picking the picture. The room where I was here and after the game was that everybody feels he put the hex on the team. When they lost the game there at the end. Okay. And have a nice say whatever you're celebrating. Nice quans. I guess he just want to burped that out. 5.670560 pound 5.660 on a AT&T line. We got our first woman to the ear yet. No. What's straight? Love a quid. I don't know. Whatever they make it. Whatever whatever it is. Whatever the standard is would like some instructions. I don't know. I'm just sitting here in pop at like pez. Like Mickey Mouse says. I'll be pop and give us gone and love a quid like pez. Something an act is thing out. I'm serious. Could you hear it? Can't you? A little bit. A little not bad. But I've had the cool. I've got it on week or Sunday. I have these sort of tall drops. Oh yeah. That'll do it. Thanks. I know it. If I could give me out of here again. I don't think we should do the whole four hours to do. Let's play some tapes. No. Because it's not. See, I really thought. Call me a moron. I guess somebody already did moron. But I thought that January 2 is when they holidays end. That's why I came back. I could have probably scammed the old till Monday. You know what? Well, they're coasting. Don't you think I could have scammed the old. Oh, speaking of the coast. WMGE goes hip hop. Yeah. It's now WMIB. I know I already mentioned this. But maybe we got somebody else who's heard it so far. Because I asked kids, Scurvy, who was in here this morning. Give me a nice big fat cigar. Do you see that big fat one at Kikurri? Whipped out. And I gave it to George. By the way, kid, thanks very much. But I don't smoke those big hand rolled ones. Oh, especially the ones that got that mung at the end there. I do for the stars. On circumstances ones. Ooh, man. That was nasty. Look like a famos cigar. I've never seen anything like that in my life. Didn't it? It's said on the end, made in famosa. Right on the tip. It said that. But anyway, he was telling me about the new hip hop. And he said it's a WEDR light. He said, just what we needed was another hip hop stick. Spom may be we'll get a more objective view from somebody in the audience. Because probably the people on their power down the hall. He or crap in their pants about it. He would never let that out to me because then I go on here and tell you that. All of me like kid Kri a lot. He is a good guy for 72. Used to be the oldest guy in the building until somebody came along. Here's West Palm Beach, hello. Oh, no. Yes, sir. Hey, good morning. How you doing? Great. I'm, hey, the only thing we're disturbing, we're looking at more every day. Is when you drive well, town, value back. Yeah. You know that beef, oh, don't boys everywhere. I haven't seen anything we had about a herd of bottom. There's like 2 on 95, one of the turnpikes. And it's huge. It says beef, though. It's almost like he's my daughter. And you do understand that's one for each of his listeners. He doesn't show in the book. He has a non-measurable audience. And he still's got billboards, more power to him. Nice going, beef. Hey, you're all sniffing away steps. You can't see his ankle personally. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, man, man, how so? Yeah. No, boy, does he have net dogs, nuts in the sand or what? Yes. Really game, man. He does the play by playing the color. I don't listen to him on radio, so I don't know about that. Is he really stepping all over now? Yeah, I mean, I think he has a cue to that dog when he can talk. Just manage. I am a pussy. Well, there you go. Okay, thanks a lot. He's also picking on poor Joe Rose, another one of our good friends. We even though he's a little bit of a backstabber. It's still pretty good guy. Right? Especially now that I've pushed him up with his teeth. Amen. Yeah, we like Joe Rose. Joe, we never had any problem with Joe. Bonded in the morning. Joe had a problem with moth that day that he wanted to take him out. Remember that? I wish you all the best to wake him up here on his floor. Remember that? Yeah, that was funny. Yeah, that was because he didn't like the format. As if moth was going to go in there to fill us and say, oh, the water not. He's sorry. I slipped. And to look at that, the market is up 145 points. Let's hear it. The dough is going up. Neal is back. It's going to be a great new year. Come on. Let's pretend we think it's going to be a great year. Let's lie about it. Start. Let's forget about North Korea and the guy damn you. Rackies and the Arabs. Oh, it's speaking to the Arabs. Now you did see the thing. I mean, talk about stupid. I don't want to say that we're stupid. Our intelligence people. It's an oxymoron American intelligence. But the FBI is talking to this Pakistani juror. They used his picture. See, when when you get a phony passport, it's always a good idea to steal somebody else's identity. Follow what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. And somebody that you can appear to look very much like. Right? Right? Or even better than whatever. Or maybe he had another picture on it that was really his own picture. But the fact of the matter wasn't just the one guy, obviously. It was all five of these guys that they're looking for were came in from Toronto. A. Those damn can. And they're blaming the Canadians. Which they got to take the blame because they're a bunch of slackers. You know, why came back? Although that's American customs. When you're coming back in the airport at Pearson. And the guy takes your passport and he slips it through the thing. The information he says, where were you? What state were you born in? I said New York. Okay. Have a nice trip. That was it. What state were you born in New York? That's it. So that's a 150 chance. There anyway. Okay. I could have guessed it. I could be an ass murderer. They wouldn't know. He said, how about those maple leaves? I said, yeah. Don't know. I don't know how about we're doing it. How about that we know, Vancouver, the night with all of injuries. How we're doing it, baby. Let's talk some hockey. No. That'll blow the rest of the audience off. Whatever you didn't already do with. And we have a lady on here. Our first lady in the year. Let's do a drum roll. I bet you're not that bitch. Here is our first lady of 2013. Oh. In four water down. Hello. Welcome back to the old. Thank you. How are you? Happy New Year. And the same to you. You're not that nasty bitch. They're called and Ripley, the other day. The George? Oh, no. I'm another bitch. Okay. I just wanted to say welcome back. And you got a lot of lady listeners. Why do you keep saying that? Why does everybody always say that to me? I have a lot of lady listeners. But they just don't put us down in the diaries. It's just unfashionable to admit they listen to the show. Oh, no. I thought everybody else. Oh. But I'm not going to get you dirty. Look. No. But I told them to, you know, off. They tell me they got it. Exactly. Did you hear about the brewery? Is, uh, old Goldstein's house last week? Yeah. I mentioned that before about the picture him with a came on the Golden Slipper's Yeah. And he was working to crowd. I liked it. So, um. And then the business about his girlfriend. I can assure you that, uh, that's that's a really stretch in it. And the term two. I think he was working it and the crowd too. Right. Have a great day, sweetheart. You too. Very new. Mary, uh, to you. Mary, Mary from Bucks North. Remember we heard from Mary Mary not too long ago? Mm-hmm. That was pretty exciting. Five to see. We got a whole different attitude about the show this year. Like I said, I did hear Tom Jickle was filling in for any K-1 night when I was up in Toronto. I heard that. In fact, remember one of his many spy reports. I can rip him now because he's out of town. And I think Ferrell still out in LA so they're not hearing. He's probably listening on the internet. How you doing, remember? How's it going, eh? And that's right. They're on the way. They got to play Colorado. And I think I got to play in Vancouver. Saturday after the Panthers. I was going to play to the one went over the Comotos New Jersey Devil's yesterday. And a metal lens with a big crowd of about 7,000 people. Yeah, they got 38 points. Not too bad. They're even getting out of road. Not too bad at all at home. Kind of coma inducing. And nobody cares. They've destroyed the franchise. Even though the record is not that bad, my kids do an a beautiful job. But, uh, what kind of telling? Nobody cares. Very sad. Now that I'm back, I can go to a bunch of hockey games, George. Right. Uh-huh. All right. How exciting, man. We got to step a cany of philic, can you smell it? Like, uh, Bokeh Branson. The beat of sounds floor it do. Ha ha ha ha. I can smell it about 1200 miles away. Here's another lady in Miami, hello. Hello? Yes, man. Well, hi there. Sir, sir, Neil. I'm sorry. So you used to calling the talking to George. How you doing? You called George? You put you believe it or not? I really dig him. I really do. He's a nice guy. He's a genius. He is so sharp. He's a sharp as a tack. He's talking about asshole the tongue eating. How can you do it? I really do it. If he was particularly eating ass, man, we'd be a lot better often. That trying to be this world expert, you know, about the Koreans and about all these other Goops. If he would just stick to the ass, stuff, man, he'd have a tension. I'm telling you. That's the world, the world is all about eating ass. Sneaking with that little brown crack. Yeah, you know what? I wouldn't have any little bit of that nail, but the side's the point. Yeah. I tell you, fair. I know, fair. Well, I used to see you back in the day when the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the arena and I just run into you and I just love going to the day. Those are the days. I went to the game like last weekend and I didn't even recognize one guy on, on the, on the team. I, I mentioned that to John, yes, they were watching a game. I said, one of the reasons people know because they don't know when these players are. They suck and they are, and on top of it, they suck. It's terrible. But they're only four points out of first place in a little girl division of theirs. They're not going to bad. Exactly. I guess so, but, you know, it's just, but they give it the promise of the home games have all been so coma and, and do soon. It's just so, uh, not good, not good and a quick and a crowd. Because I got the hockey package up there to run or I see little bits and pieces of the game. And even though they try not to show you the, the stands every once in a while, a camera at a certain angle. You can see that there's nobody there. And then, and then they get two sellouts back to back out of the blue against the Dallas and a range of last weekend. And they, and they score a total of one goal in both games. Oh, I know it was up to Dallas game. It was totally confusing. I couldn't believe how it was bad. And it was the first game I'm bringing my child to and it was like, well, my maple leaves are doing pretty Dan good, okay. And spite of all of our problems were after the slow start, we're doing pretty good. Yeah, I thought about you while I was heard that day we're going to be playing. So, how I'm glad that you're back. Not that I'm not just, you know, in pure George's work, but I really miss you. Well, you know, after George is fine for like, you know, a couple of days, but like an hour, he's pretty good. 10 or 15 minutes during a break when I go out and take a big dump during those few minutes he does a masterful job. Have a great day and I'm happy new year. I'm going to leave you now because I know you all busy. Okay, thanks. Bye now. Oh, I saw a great thing on one of the history channels. See, my, my digital cable in Toronto is so much better than the cable we got here. Kable here is Sox Ellis as can be. No serious. I got about like 10 different history channels and I got that drive in TV channel. I told you about in screen TV and all of this good stuff, the biography channel, etc. We're talking about those, the different hits. But I saw a mafia documentary. I hadn't seen me for which I thought I'd seen them all. Go ahead and sneeze. They'll think it's me. Oh, I would never sneeze. That was like a panzy sneeze. I think they're right. Huh? That was like a little panzy. That was like a leo. Leo, the capio snow. Please, no, I'm insulting. Yes. That was bad. I'm going to tell them all about that. I'm going to leave my note and anonymous note that Guava Eaton's spik sneezes like a panzy. Remember Matt La panzy? He was in that movie. Am I tutor? Any gallery to live in Newton's John? Sir, watching this mafia. Yes, he's related to Elton, John? No. So I haven't talked about fat boy yet from our sales department. And we have a wheeled the gurney up here yet when his body strapped to it. This is the year I think. Now we're going to carry over the money from my serious office pool on fat boy. Does that carry over to 2003? It's a roll over kind of. Double or nothing? Here's a call from Miami. Hello? Yes, sir. Good morning. Winner's to you? How are you? Excellent. I'm looking for my little frog. I'm doing pretty good. Yeah, I'm looking for all his more Howard David stuff. Actually, his name is Mo Howard. Yeah. I think I have as much as Lee Corsough. Oh, yeah, he's another one. That'd be a good poll one way. Let's take a poll one day. Who do you hate the most Lee Corsough or Bino Cook? It's a push. Um, me all. This guy's more Howard. I mean, this guy comes in the town. He's got to understand him when he comes out of this radio station. I know he did Monday night football. He thinks he's big time. Yeah. He's a big guy. If you, then Hank. And a man dog. And then man, bitch. Right. And then, and then, Mo Howard. I mean, this guy is awful. You look like a guilty. Well, guilty. Back. Me all, me all this, um, this guy's got to understand that, that now that there's no football to talk about. What are you going to talk about? Yeah, what are you going to do now? How is he going to, how is he going to cut guilty off of the past? Every time he brings up something about the Panthers are hockey, how is he going to do that now? And of course, I guess what he'll probably do is milk the dolphin thing, which he would be easy to do in this town because they'll be crying about it until April 15 when the draft comes or whatever the date April is. Well, he doesn't even like the dolphins. He likes the jet, he likes the Patriots. Well, all I can say is it's a little bit suspect for a guy to use to do the Celtics games and work in Boston all those years to be picking the Patriots to beat the dolphins and then pretend to Harvey Green. He's just doing it as a joke. See, it's all it. He's talking about me doing things under the guys of stick and yet, which I really do. And in his case, he does things that pretend he's only joking about him and turns up the who knows. Amy, I think it's, I also, I think it's the B.S. that he didn't say he fired the beast. I mean, can you break? Sir, I'm going to tell you right now, as George is my witness. There is no chance in the world that anybody other than Mohour David blew the beast off an at show. Not only did he blow him off the show, but the morning that Howard took the day off or was sick or whatever and the beast was interacting with Gildey on there. He called in and said, get him off of there. He's on professional. Let him do the scores on the updates, but don't let him get on the show. And I was in a building when it happened. I was here. But he's going to not put his body's going up to do silent reporting for the R.K. But forget about whether he's good or bad. I mean, he can come on here and say he's the worst thing he ever heard. And that's his opinion. He's entitled to his show. But why does he always deny it? Why is he always put it over on me? Oh, you're hooded with a train monkeys and he can say anything and they believe it. Why would I make that up? What would be the point of my making that up? I don't know. Let's take we should just put Jim Rome on in the morning. Oh, God. Have a great day. He was doing so good up until that point, you know what? Rome? Have I heard Romey? Well, I haven't checked the affiliate. Oh, yeah, check the affiliate. Let's, of course, think out a pretty weak signal. 147 votes on a pull on the aradios.com. Let's get this audience back, baby. George Bushred it. Let's get it back. Let's not beat around a bush when George is on the audience flies away from here, but that's he can't help it. He's got, you know, he's lame. Ah. Actually, George is the problem with George is he needs a voice transplant. He's like, you know, they maybe we can get a two for one deal. Because the words that are coming out are fine. What you're saying? What you're saying? No, you don't need to coach. You need a transplant. A voice transplant. I mean, maybe let's strap on a couple of balls at the same time. What I'm not high pitched. If you ever speak to that man again, I ain't gonna. I mean, in my wrong way I'm saying no. If somebody, I mean, he, you'll work for him. He has no authority. He already tried. Definitely then you're got you fired, but the first time was it in his case. Then it couldn't happen. So what power does he have over you with this program? He has no business interfering with this program. None. And he doesn't. And if the management he read any brains, they would make them sure they keep his ass away from this program. I mean, he can take all of a shot. And these people, or ginger rogers, what do I care? I think that's amusing. That's fine. If Mohour is okay, what's wrong with ginger rogers? I've got a sense of humor. I can take all the crap, but there's a difference between stick. And at business that not so subtle business about the Oregon ducks and about how they don't want to be on it. And you know something if the hurricanes came into tomorrow on the day at the goddamn Fiesta bowl. And they said, we don't want your broadcasting hurricane sports anymore until you get that fat fat, fat, fat, and all of that. See that? How do you like it? How do you like it? All right. The power just went out. Right in the middle of that sentence. I feel like freaking Howard Beal. No, not that much like Howard Beal. Now what's that? What was I saying? Are we back on? We lost the part of the amazing thing is the phones are all still on there. How do you like these? They throw all on little backups. You know those things in there that beep. We have backup power supplies down here. Oh, I have been Toronto even. Even my little studio up there. I was at a George before to show today. How come I got a better studio with better equipment in Toronto and a much better internet? I mean, my connection up there on Bells in Padico with sensational. Never have one moment of downtime. There's no delay. Everything is instantaneous. I punch in the words Tom Brady on a search. His naked picture comes up. Life size. Yeah. But down here, everything is like kind of like not slow, not fast. Just kind of like half fast. That's the way to so the power just went out and muff came in. He's chuckle. Got to hate it. He's the only one here today in management. Clarence is out there to festival. Like I said, trying to get laid in Arizona. He does realize Arizona is like an outdoor nursing home. You ought to feel at home there. You know? Now, maybe because I saw that big article in one of the local fish records this morning about what a change since 87 that that embarrassing festival at Jimmy Johnson thing with the the hurricane. That's where the whole hurricane thing started. That's when I started calm to her. When they were wearing a khakis against their her cools all that stuff. And what a change. These are the gentler nicer kinder. Yadayel. Great. By the way, does Georgia have other than that one kid that defensive back to the quarterback? Who's like a mug one who I think is from a entry. Do they have any white kids on that team at all? No. That's what they won. That's what a kick for the state's last night. Oh my god. What a desperate effort. God. Not only did the dolphins embarrassed on Sunday. But the. The leaders and the animals both lost yesterday. Oh, right. Let's hear it. I wish starting out in a game rooting for a Georgia. And then I kind of turned because I realized that they didn't have any white guys on the team. So I know. I certainly I started rooting for a festival and then I went to bed. It was a pretty terminal game. Let's face it. The hurricanes are a semi-protein. They're going to be the national champion. They're going to beat the crap out of Ohio state. Like I started this same before the power went up before an active. Oh, good. If the hurricanes get me or not, it said we don't want to be on here unless you get the Orojuz off here. It's okay. Good luck over there with Claire Channel. This station makes big fat juicy money off this show. Which you never know. And they wouldn't have a spot. But that's because it's a you know, into the year first of the year. Big bucks from this show. Hurricanes. You make any money from that? No. No. Not only that, but then that contract we have to carry those basketball games and the baseball games. I mean, nobody's listed those. Okay. And I'm saying that haven't done six years of UN baseball, which I enjoyed. But I knew that nobody was listening. You could fit him in a goddamn boom closet. And the proof in the pudding they get an on campus basketball stadium after all these years of winding and excuses. And they'll have a big crowd there Saturday because it's the grand opening. But after that, they'll have the same 1100 people in there that they used to have an arena. Well, be a different. There's no interest. Oh, come on. You're wrong. You're just being a star. Okay. We'll see. Just like the Panthers are going to have all sell out. So where's the the I'm. I can feel it. I can smell it. Come on. Let's get out that. I'm going to get out that. Many days we love your pan. There's come on. Let's put up some excitement. No. They don't care. See, I'm learning. It's taken me about a hundred years to learn my lesson. You're not going to change these people. You're not going to change this town. They don't give a flying crap. Okay. They don't give a flying flick. Look at that. And how come we got is this thing working out of satellite? Oh. Now, what is that language? Oh, I spun. You'll, I don't want to English. I don't want, is this going to flip over to something or what? I have to do something with it. I don't know. I did it with it. Oh, my god. The power goes up. I have been on here here for an hour and a half. And already the power went out. The TV goes off. The internet's like marginal ed best. Slow as molasses. Man, you could stick a goddamn hose into the side of a maple tree and get six gallons of maple syrup faster than you can get out of the nearest.com on this website. Right, am I right? Right. What I say on this website on this thing, you have a piece of crap. How's Eric doing, by the way? It's just fine. 26 past 10 at 5, 60 WQAM. Tom Lamin and General Sales Manager Joe Prieto of Heliponti, I don't think this is a right copy. Isn't it the one you took off the tax machine? I don't think so. I think this is a wrong piece of copy. Oh, no. This is the one I brought from Toronto. No, they supposedly faxed you one this morning. Wait, you know what? Let me look for it. Hey, this is... No, I'm not talking about like with music. I'll look for a while running here. Here, I can kill a little time. Don't you like my little red folder? It's got all the copy in it. I just stick it in my sack. I take it to Toronto. I take it to bring it back here. I know I got new copy for Heliponti. I sure want to get time leaving all up to it. He'll be getting phone calls right now. You know that faggot screwed up your spot? No, I did not yet. I'm working on a time. Maybe it's in a waste basket. Oh, oh. Well, let's see, is that it now? Here's a whole bunch of crap that came over to Fax machine that you were making copies on didn't work out too well. Hey! I think somebody took a dump in his waste basket. Here's someone to mail. I went through a thanks to my good friend Dave Johnson for his yearly Christmas card. The series got Philis Diller on there with him. We should have known from that. When you shot that crap off, we should have known right from that day. The first day that Greg, remember that day when Greg brought Moan here in the first time I ever met him. Right? To suck up, you know, and to try to break him in a little bit and make him feel at ease. I don't think I did get new copy for how it. You got me looking here like some kind of a schmuck. I don't think I ever got it. Huh? So what should we do? Should we defer the spall? Let's move it around. Maybe they'll fax us a new copy. Immerald coast or something. Let's do Emerald Coast right now. And then we'll work on that. Now I did get new copy for Emerald Coast. Have I got it here somewhere? See, you've got me all turned around because we got so many spots today. I can't keep track of all these a piece of copy. Here's a good idea. The new year, let's ring it in the right way and let's attack the buffet. Huh? Let's attack the buffet at the Emerald Coast Chinese buffet. Sounds good to me. In fact, I think this weekend. I'm going to get over there. They got three locations for you. Sunrise, North Miami Beach, and the newest Emerald Coast is in prestigious Geographic Pembroke Pines. Start your mother-watering eating experience. Your pickout experience with six different soups. Try them all. Try one or two or whatever you like. Stick stuff some in your pants. Then sample dozens of suck of the hunt trays or animal surf and turf on a weekend. And New York strip made the order with the gourmet center and that gourmet center was something really special. A sizzling Asian grilla butteriafis steak shrimp chicken seafood handcar perimib, like I said all cooked to your order. And the Emerald Coast buffet promotes healthy living. They cook all of their fine stuff with cholesterol free oils. No MSG, no cornstarch, no cramp. And the buffet at the Emerald Coast features a full salad bar. A new sushi bar and fresh room cocktail too. An Emerald Coast famous lobster feast is back featuring lobster thermators and lobster Bisc. One requirement at the Emerald Coast you must leave room for dessert. They got pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite toppings and fresh fruit that's a perfect ending to one forgettable meal. This is the right copy either. No. I'm... I don't know. Maybe I screwed up. Is that possible? I know that's not the right copy. And I just want to take a look and see if I find the other one. I might be something different in it. Maybe they don't have lobster feast. I don't know. I think the best idea is go over there and see what they got. That's a good idea. Sounds great. They got lots of good stuff. See how you want to attack the buffet. I think maybe the two different pieces of copy disappeared here. The new ones. Because this is 1129. On fact, this one says, yeah. Oh, thanks so much. Happy showing it. Give me also an Emerald Coast film while you're at it. We got a halet. We got a little code. They got all kind. I probably threw out the new ones. Now, I'm not going to do that spot over again. Okay. No, well, we're not on the air anyway here. This is just a variety of runes. Is this really on the air? No. I didn't think so. It's a really good way. This doesn't look like a real radio studio to me. It looks like a piece of crab. Looks like a joke. Emerald Coast now with three locations. Sunrise at Pine, I'm not 44. Collins Avenue just north of 163rd North by me Beach. And at the intersection of Flamingo and Pembroke in Pembroke, Pines. Where's my drugs, by the way? Emerald Coast of Cepter Reservations. Take on delivery available as well. Call 9 5 4 5 7 2 38 22 for more information on the Emerald Coast. And look for their new Oriental chicken salad. It's more than just chicken schmith at the Emerald Coast Chinese buffet. My life and look all this is for 2560. You wait, you wait. It's how it, how it dated. You wait, you wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. You wait. It's coming up. It's in there for you to fall to star. It's one of the best. It's coming up. It's in there for you to fall to star. In Jimmy. There's another actor on the elephant. I quoted for you. I reported it, it ran to the party. I knew it was a failure. Far from other brothers. Far from another guy. They got imported. I punished. I didn't do that. I reiss off the rail. Are you in there now? Who's been dicking with this? I haven't been dicking with it But I'm playing it all week and it sure is how it wasn't on continuous How do you like that? I told you when I came in here this morning It's obvious that somebody was having heavy duty in here yesterday or last night or whatever And they got all this sports crap on my computer That wouldn't have been me on the URL line. You know when you go and you click on all your uh, you know Your favorites. You got ESPN dot com and sportscraft dot com and sports nerd dot com And there's a big sign on the door out there. It says don't tick with any of the computers on in here And no matter who you are what you're doing or uh, you know, how much you know Greg read and He's still coming here in dick around.

Phil gave him a big hug and said rage really came in and came through for him Phil Donahue's floundering new show has gotten a new lease on like thanks to Regis Philbin Here's a pal guess who stepped up to help me out. He's prices Donahue to clear thinking chat King Philbin for guessing on a show With critics predicting that Donahue's MSNBC gig was close to getting axed He needed a try to chew audience poor who better than the wildly popular co-host of live with Regis And Kelly see I don't understand that I like Regis, you know And we'll never forget that day before we became too big for his brooch is when we had him on the phone and he said I like him, but why is he so wildly popular? I have no idea He doesn't I mean he's amusing not not not real funny, but amusing, you know, it kind of a low key way too yeah But I don't feel personally called Regis and asked him to help save his shows as a source and Regis came through for him Even though he usually runs a mile from anything political reads told him everybody needs it helping hands sometime That's what I tell a lot of guys even the great Phil Donahue just tell me how I can help Phil explained he was at his wit's end trying to figure out why a show was sinking Regis told him look pal Paly nobody knows why working the ratings are deserved, but if I if I appear as a guest We'll have us a good laugh if nothing else and that's exactly what happened to Simbert 10 for an hour at least the dark cloud There's been hovering over Donahue for the past few months seem to disappear Since it's July debut the shows remained in a distant third as we've been telling you with the ratings from the grudge report Phil could hardly contain his emotions as an insider as he gave Regis a big hug and told him you came through for me when I really needed you Thanks pal and did he an MSEC's MSNBC spokesman confirms the monahue show ratings have improved Yeah, see we now doesn't say what the ratings are in here though I'd like to know exactly what they were they will have to talk to our good friend mr.

I have a question that I'd be very interesting for your listeners, but yeah Since I am just completely sick of this that's full that we live in I was just curious can you just tell me a little bit about how you were able to I mean I know you make a lot of money so obviously I'm not like you but as far as living in Toronto or in Canada in general I mean how how could one go about moving up there? I mean I know do you have to have dual residency to do that and Expect about their compared to here and Just think oh, it's a lot it's a lot cheaper there because a Canadian dollar's only worth 63 and a half-sensei So it's so it's a good bargain for Americans Yes, that's true. Hey, but you don't have to be a Canadian citizen. I mean look at all the people that have a Partman's down here than out of American citizens. They're like the snowboards. They don't you don't have to be a Canadian citizen Or half-work yeah, that's why come back every once in a while just long enough to put my toe on a soil Okay Is it Is it a place you'd recommend or any other places in Canada? When you say is it a place I'd recommend for what I mean what what does that mean? I recommend I don't know what that means For an ordinary slip like myself who you know It's just a hardworking guy who's just absolutely think of this well Toronto is a great city. I'll tell you that if you don't like to cool weather You wouldn't like it because they got plenty of cool weather But it's not the real nasty grotesque In fact, it's even not nearly as bad as upstate New York even though it's further north because it's on the north shore like Ontario So they get like the real bad buffalo roaches to rubsit New York weather Okay, I love Toronto, but that doesn't mean you'd like it just because I like it that I mean I like rockin' nice cream with it Don't mean you like it. Oh no, absolutely not I just heard from people outside of the because to be out for the eye I am only fortunate to hear your show every couple of months because of work and all that but well that's that's not acceptable That's that's not good. Yeah I'm I was in No, of course they are One and there should have been one more selection on our pool for the New Year's resolution and that should be listen to new Rogers a lot more in 2003 That's right.

I get That morning when he ran two minutes over and still had to come back and give a shitholeh That whole and talk about you undermining the emperor or whatever that was about that Let's see I would totally be for the show. It's the only time when I was in Toronto these led these 10 days But I turned it on I was sitting in there watching my computer or something and I reached over and I opened a pot to see what was going on And it's two minutes late. They ran which I don't understand how come off the morning show can't get out at nine o'clock They got so much important crap Maybe it's because they only got three hours to fill They got so much heavy duty stuff. They can't get out on time. It's like us today. We got so many spots We can't get out of here on time While spending the remainder of your golden years in the land of death the one thing you have to defend on is your car With two canoes after on the rise the people who brought you a big black guy named Ben Carilarm now Bring you and old Jewish guy named Isaac get away from my is quarter of a bill You big and the Remember when we used to boost a packet carabine We ought to get a bundle of mishmating the white ones are cool Get away from my is quarter of the ill you big and the F How is that I am the excierist Profitting like that Get away from my quarter of the ill you big and the F Get away from my quarter of the ill you big and the F You're never some best tries to steal my town. I feel safe But with an old Jewish guy named Isaac get away from my quarter of the ill You big and the F get your old Jewish guy named Isaac Carilarm now and receive a free flower antenna Get away get away get away from my quarter of the ill You big and the F and old Jewish guy named Isaac Carilarm Are they available at all zeros stores 11 to 15 60 WCM there is not one call on the board Boy you talk about a real slap in the face 27 years of slave it over this hot microphone I come back after all these months of being away after a long wonderful vacation Well, it's my fault and George Dree What on the pack's is your comments a Georgia to great job and your presence of course those are the people are still listening Right just wait that's why I never take a poll about how did you do right after I come back because the ones who like you Those 20 or 30 are they're still listening and then takes me about a month to get the whole audience back Then I go on vacation again. See not a good idea We'll get some calls on here. You'll see now is this what is this article you just hand this is from Carlos by the way. I'm reading this cold from the Boston globe 1229 2002 It's about Carlos's close personal friend More Howard David good for Chris every week. They the host of the Howard David show in Miami's WCM Science off after his six tonight a.m. Stin with have a nice day and paradise There's irony in that because Miami hardly welcome David arguably the best known radio voice on the nation sporting landscape With open years last March when he was also named the play by play voice of the dolphins It wasn't because David was in the Yorker because Miami certainly well populated with transplanted New Yorkers I also wasn't because David's voice of it becomes anonymous with Monday night football after calling those games and the Super Bowl for the past six seasons With Westwood one radio scenes when his resonating basso profundo let you know immediately where you were on the dial David takes the high road on being replaced by Marv Albert at Westwood one last after last season calling his 23-year association with network a rewarding experience That's how it was sand down here Because of the NFL's proprietary control of network replays we've heard Gil Santos is called of the Patriot Super Bowl victory often Boston was scheduled to hear David's version last February when W E E I and WBC and scheduled dueling radio replays of the Patriot Super Bowl victory until the NFL stepped in suffice to say David's call heard this week on ESPN sports center Year and Review segments also was good, but we digress the problem with David in Miami was personal To many Miami and David's voice have become extricably associated with dolphins main rivals They hated New York jets for whom he did play by play for the previous four years. How do you like that? Sounds a little gay When David became one of those transplanted New Yorkers last March doing his morning show with partner Steve Geldy Goldstein the local butcher from the Cape Coral types already Depounds the attitude was how dare you come into our domain said David believe me. I still have the scars David was confident he could win over the fandom once he started doing the games, but that was six months and a long hot summer away I'm reading this, but I don't see this going anywhere really saying anything Carlos does it say anything? No, no without me get it to me for you idiot Jesus, right in you teach him anything while I was gone Yeah, how does saving the bathroom? Oh, yeah, I noticed that he showers and shaves and Brushes his teeth in the bathroom. I go in at this morning to take a leak before to show there's Carlos in there Take an asshower under the goddamn faucet Man, how does disgusting you should see where you take a ride? I don't want to hear about it So I'm we're getting back to fat boy and the toilet. Okay. We better take these calls. We got a lot of calls on here now Lady and Miami Beach, hello I'm doing great. Welcome back. As soon as you get back it's how to check how to smit yeah Right now I was calling did you hear the by any chance and you format on the formula lily Megah no that's what that's what we're asking you about. I did you hear it? Yeah, it is you hear the promos like stuff about spots they do to promote it. It's very offensive if I was Listening to that what does it say it's like 10,000 joints every day All right, but there's a puzzle in all of our cars A puzzle yeah, that's a cross that's clear channel. Fizzle puzzle. That's what most of the stations do Fizzle Don't you have a great job you got my panties really wet all right excellent. He says hang on. I'll take your number Okay, hang on see She's hanging on but I could have right off. We don't need to create anymore domestic stripe in a Rodriguez household I'll tell you that right now. He's already got more than enough Between a sickly wife and his bitchy mother. He's and his unwanted kid. I mean he's got more than enough problems They're already plus whatever he's getting on the side. How do you work that call return? I notice he have a lot more sex George and vote for that this one because he's already given up Yeah, sexist dangerous. Yeah. He's already been beaten down so to speak well. Plus he's always got those treasure island gifts look forward to when's the next one? I don't know because hi boy Yes, he's the A.E. and I depend upon you Oh, so in other words, see here's basically what's happened boys and girls those of you who don't like too many commercial interruptions Your fears at least for the near future you don't have to worry about it because our sales department has just been effing off It's so nothing is going on. We don't have any spots for anybody Even a highly oversouled morning show at their dollar-rahalar spots even guilty this morning came into the doorway Man at least I got a lot of time to talk Whatever he said Watch out for him. I'm telling you look after the guilty myster That's what rumors said 567560 pound 560 on the AT and T see this year. That's my personal news resolution How holding nothing back? I'm letting it all hang right out and there's nothing worse than having a hanger especially when a phone is ringing You remember that happened yes, and in fact I don't think muff knows this maybe he's listening to his office because he ain't got nothing else to do anyway You know that he he listens to the whole show for four hours in his office. That's what that's what he does he gets paid for it I think if there are a lot of you folks out there would love getting paid Listen to this show every day. We probably have a 20-share if we'd start doing that. I do But anyway, so I called him about my check From Toronto on I guess it was Friday Thursday Friday last week whatever day it was and he was gonna get with Jen and accounting and Bob Abombie, but so I finished the call and As soon as I hung it up nature started calling you know, I mean that's that pressure down under the funder down under And I thought to myself as I was walking from my living room to the tea room. I thought you know with my luck I'll sit down on there and the phone will be him call and back. You don't take it with you. So I sat down on there and What happened and the or the problem was I had a hanger oh yeah no matter how you shit I was a wire hanger either thank God Don't call it Joan of what's your name Crawford would have been pleased. There wasn't a wire hanger I hate when those things come up wouldn't would hanger So anyway the phone was ran it was him calling back, but it wound up okay It all turned out oh no this isn't right this story about rich sure I'm not reading it We already talked about it. You did very briefly. I I'm sorry. I'm not picking on Ricky Tickio case been on a year for over 40 years in his market and so we had a little bit too late I'm not picking on him. Okay. What? We didn't make an issue out of it. I just don't good I'm not as a fact that he had a DUI or whatever and I'll it was it for was good enough for Peter Royal Why not good enough women plus the Peter Royal one got covered up real well except on this show and Diana Ross Oh and I almost forgot about her I got the Diana Ross thing here somewhere and I missed my pile of stuff I don't want to go into my pile that I'll save it for tomorrow. What maybe I'll save it for Monday No, because I don't want to do like a bunch of periodicals on audio and do bedtime stories or get too noisy Because those were the bad mistakes we made last year and one of our new years resolutions is not make the same mistakes again And certainly not gonna involve with that moment my student morning that piece of turd With that tragic tragic piece Now do you think that it would be offensive if I walked into window in there in the morning when I came in everything just stared at them until he did Although he he's I'm sure he'll be sitting even more of an angle facing the wall facing the other way to make sure he doesn't catch a glimpse of me Because that one day when I was here the last time that he did with his head nearly spun off his shoulders When I stood in the doorway and all I was doing was holding up those anal love beads I don't know what possessed me. I just want to see if they still had the door open there the control room door Which usually they have shut solid just to make sure you don't have to see any of us well I got a better one than that that I haven't even said on the area Well, it's here during the Christmas party. Yeah, that another table. I offered anyone at our table a hundred dollars to go Snatch the piece off his head. Oh my god. That would have been great. We could have put the picture on our website I put it on the table the hundred dollars and no one took it Wow, that bunch of pussy's around even Carlos wouldn't do it for a hundred bucks. He wasn't at the party That's six weeks pay he left he would have known he did done it he did on there for twenty bucks Yank that baby off of there and his piece two now which which hairpiece was who wearing at the Christmas party fancy one which by the way Far heads and shoulders heads and shoulders I hear that's what he can't who's it with better looking than the other one yeah, and the birds nest that he comes in here Oh my god, so in other words say he's always picking on me not dressing up to come to work here When he goes to a big party a big social event like that like the Q and Christmas party He puts on his Sunday and Monday and Tuesday best it had a golden hue. Oh gold to me I love it rhymes with gay. Yeah 567.0560 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line 233 votes What's your new is resolution this year new is resolutions are for assholes that by the way I said that extra allow for my good friend Lynn Samuels happy new year Lynn.

You know if any I've asked you this before, but it is something I think about a lot Sure, where my mind is in the gutter is there any other animal that takes a crap as it's moving up to the in a horse Although I will say my little dog He hops around when the grass is high like right now. No, he squats, but he's got a hop around You like a buddy right back at you. No, no, it's not that it's just that he has hard time keeping his Balance on a high grass because it's only like you know 10 pounds So he hops around and you think he's done and now all of a sudden he's hops through another spot He's squatting over there. He likes to spread it around. I like we do on the show kind of like Mo Well, I sure miss him coming back on his day when I had a bad stroke of fortune coming back on my very first day So I couldn't wear that silly pop in a park Hawaiian who lister if they sent me to where it'll stay there in a window But I'm not even gonna dignify him by doing that because that would be suggesting that I'm gonna change my my appearance my dress Slip Based on what he has to say on your scrum does that mean you're not gonna wear that way guy, but you I'm not gonna wear those gold Lamei panties either. How do you like that? What good thing to say the receipt my wear the gold Lamei shoes that out gold steam loans me boy, but a fashion plate He is five six seven.

Okay, I'm putting my pocket I'm gonna do what I go home because I think that might be the problem I think maybe while I was away John was in there did learn with some stuff on a computer and did it up could be because I I've done that You start clicking where you don't know where you're clicking and all of a sudden you got problems, baby That's my advice for the new year is only click it where you know what you're a clicking Take a good long look at it before you put it in your mouth any piece of food. That's what I'm talking about Huh, no, that's it if you're gonna go on a diet Seriously, I would think about that the other day if you're gonna go on a diet before you just start shoveling crap in your mouth Take a look at it and say do I really want this is this really gonna make me feel better is this gonna be good for me? I did that with the donuts that are out there right there. There you go and not interested in me. What kind of thing? Something oh How if you would have said crispy cream.

Pulling against the bank of white snow and darkening woulder sky the words punctuated by drawing of a flying saucer Pull visitors in a way seen nearly near ordinary nearly ordinary campground as serene It says Nearly except for the odd tear-shaped buildings designed we've hooked a form of alien spacecraft This is the headquarters of the aliens and these are the people that have the median all these ethicists and all these other Apolytians whipped up into a frenzy and didn't define them as if anybody believes that these oh God, well, what's the use?

What are they doing? How come the Iraqi man? I'll have like that That maybe it's because Sodom was it I don't think so I think that's no it's not it is it a groucho No, it's like third net, but it's a little thinner than that and longer across straight across right?

They're right the The old shows what we call our cards Regarding gambling. Don't forget Paul Horning noted in green bay and house carous former iowandy tour lines And any complain I said any complain ass. So I mean the W well I did forget Paul Horning and Alex care They both said a little bit of a gambling problem and speak of that I noticed while I was away all these articles about Pete Rose meeting with the But light and they might let him back in a baseball and a Hall of Fame all the stuff I don't have a problem with Hall of Fame okay stick his ass in there as if if if anybody really should cure But it held us anybody care anymore But one of the lines that I read in some store is some of the 50,000 stories about that was oh Well, he'd be a great credit to baseball if they let him back in great credit my ass. He's still gambling on ahead over a handover fist You'll see him out here at the track with his stacks a hundred dollar bills. He'd be in a disgrace to baseball So if you want to stick him in a Hall of Fame for his accomplishments during his playing career that would be fine Get it over with already and quit the waste in our time with it But this crap about what a great credit he'd be to baseball who'd allow you people kidding, huh?

I'm doing today. I'm taking off for a few weeks again I think that sounds good to me and by the way thanks again to Greg Reed for the tremendous publicity all and speaking of Carlos and Eric Didn't I mention specifically about it would be nice on my own website for the mention when Neil is coming back on a year Where does it say that? Uh-oh Where does it say that on our website on neorodges.com? I can't even on my own website get promotion when I'm coming back on here after vacations or extended like whatever it's gonna be No Much less all those great billboards I've great's got around town for us not that'll never materialize that's in my contract that this supposed to be up there But never will be So I have to work my ass off for a month For like two and a half months to get the audience back to George blue off and then by the time I get the audience back I'm on vacation again I hate that Not the vacation part but the fact that you keep blowing all the audience off. I'm sorry. We're gonna get in here to fill in Maybe we can get to what's his name mark Eisenberg. He sure had a lot of practice now in it overnight show Maybe tonight's you all put him over the edge huh four hours alone all solo on air to the six in the morning where everybody is sleeping thank God I mean, Marsha good guy, but on the air. I mean, I oh brother. He made he makes Jose Gekky sound like water crunkite Here's Miami Lake, so Hey Neil, I'll be near and same to you sir. Hey listen you're speaking all about the beast and moan I'll be sapphire and everything well handcat like uh end of the year wrap up.

I didn't want to say anything so uh just brought that up and that that was really funny to be confined that Okay, all right Neil later. Thanks a lot. Yeah, I heard about that somebody gave me a spy report on that I mean how could anybody make that up and he's always in his he's not even denying it all he's doing is a Tacken a guy. He feels by lashing out that somehow he's gonna like uh you know that Mitch guy which was obviously a son of call, but nevertheless Lashing out he's somehow gonna intimidate this guy the louder and more bombastic he gets It's gonna take the heat off a him. I'll guess what mo you're not fooling anybody You're blue to guy off the show why not we spawn honestly by saying he's unprofessional He's a meathead. He's an idiot. I'm gonna show and he's a move down to other things now That would be the honest answer as opposed to a Tacken a where do you get you information? It must be from the trained monkeys between none and one. I got news for the trained monkeys by the way Pan for you to be doing those dolphin games. No, there's sports for quality that's on his radio station, okay? common group ball I'll tell you since they that guilty spill his bag all over his lap in there. He's never been the same.

I know I find you on here somewhere. You know what and I'm how our David can get the gorilla and train monkey Harry S I'm tired here in this crap Really quick question pointy please you've been in Toronto lately's that correct? Yeah Is it snowing there right now or not? Christmas you know what upstate New York had all that snow we had about one to two inches in Toronto that day That's the only snow we had we had a few florees the rest of the time, but the very little there's no snow on the ground right now Okay, oh my my way up there. I was just curious there was snow in yet Really funny really funny story here my friend A big dolphin fan to get what a bunch of apples they are down here in South America they have a big New Year's Eve party planned and the dolphins lost So guess what he did He cried and canceled his little party because the dolphins lost a football game He can't believe what an what an idiot. He's an asshole. Yeah Let me ask you one of the question here. I was noticed whenever you guys say direct the word rectum on the air the air We're doing the bit Can you not say that word on the air say what? Got them now, but nobody can say rectum like Mitch Lewis rectum I didn't know if you were allowed to say it because you always play the better No, we can say asshole we just can't say rectum Okay, I'm sorry, but it came it came from rectum. Tell it damn they're killing me it came from that Well, you know what you have a great show. You know what? I'm not going to that hold And I hardly concur What this is a tough one. I've wrestled with this one all week and I've been and I'm not that I'm not supportive of the dolphins because I have Yeah, I like the way they play and I like when they play well, boy. They look awfully sharp I just got I have now falling into the malaise of pessimism. Oh don't do it man. Say it ain't so The Patriots But it upset wind oh Not an upset not an Patriot the Patriots will disappoint the dolphins. Oh boy, but the dolphins will get in the playoffs You better take a different plane up to doing it. I can't help it man. I got I you know Makes it slow and get a hold of you. Oh my god. Yeah, there was there was for you to hear there was the evidence But I like I said I wasn't here when it happened so I don't really don't but it was just a stupid thing to do and it keeps saying and doing stupid things Then it gets like I said bird like a little bit kid with his hand on the stove and I'm like oh I didn't really mean it. It was just a joke. I didn't have the the list of affiliates That was the altar and the fact I still it's amazing. It's the epitome of what this town is all about the Fact that the Miami-Herole which is one all these goddamn prizes and set of runs so on and here's supposed to be a real major market newspaper They put burry jackass any crap that he writes which is basically any crap that Greg read tells him and Moe Howard tells him or anybody else will speak to him Including the mad dog who denies the buddies. He can source with burry jackass. Are you ready for that? The mad dog Greg read and Moe Howard David it they all consort with the little burry jackass that little Tub of pud and he puts it a paper there this thing about well they have a weak signal Yeah, right 50,000 watts in the middle of the Dodd you idiot you jackass a name well deserved very rhymes with Mary and fairy You silly goose and he put it in the paper It's just astonishing it's shocking to me and there's no outrage and there's no people questioning I'm the only one in this whole goddamn town that brings him to bear to account for it I mean don't confuse us with the truth or with the facts. Oh I listen to you show every day you're to guys. They do a wonderful job. He didn't check the affiliate list How can he possibly not know that they're running a market? Maybe they're just coming in magically over his radio. Maybe he's got one of those magic radios And he just speaks the words Tony Bruno and there's the show shows up Howard Stern There's Howard three in the afternoon. How are Stern show comes on holding on his radio? Isn't that an exome feature? Yeah, he's got that new satellite more Howard David radio We just speak you out of the name Stupid Randy Rhodes there she is there's Randy Yes Allen I picked up the game on a big dish. He was blacked out locally if there no idea why the Panthers didn't tell about his name Not a good move nice one on a road, but it was a boring game, but nevertheless they won I just don't get it. I'm gonna have to go back and that arena the back and town straight in those assholes out See what's going on there with Alan Cohen and all those other lunatics You guys are doing a pretty good job on the ice, but off the ice boy pretty weak and that's one of the reasons because nobody knows who's on that team I see Ray Whitney had three assistant Columbus one the other night much much of that game as they beat the penguins five to two And Mike's so in your head of goal and then sister I do believe in it both having a big year sure What do I have those guys back on a team My Oh, that was the rejoin better I beg your pardon. Well, most of the guys are talking about drugs. I understand and about sex and about steroids. I mean I was told that was a rejoin that Most of us have a great life and thanks to the town wall With co-starman there, Bokka Bryant couldn't you wait like another week or two Not that I'm not happy to see it, but Jesus Christ over with a chicken neck of yours It's like I think good. I think that he loaned his neck to fat rich You'd be very proud of fat rich by the way. I'm amazed. I'm shocked But I guess it's pretty good when they tell you your blood pressure is 50 over 30 and that one chamber in your heart is a work in anymore That probably is if that scared us and do it for you then it's time to check out then to think Check out what 50 over 30. I can't even imagine a blood pressure like that. How much even Moses higher than that? Well You know what they take blood from him when he goes for blood tests. It's real easy to find a vein 560 5060 on the AT and Verizon wireless line. What is he saying? Oh, that's human He's got the most piece on there. They're back cool on the head Here's a call from the cables. Hello And Neil yes, sir. You can watch the Ohio State U of MBS to ball game. I might Really I thought you're so your a Ricos fan now. No. I didn't say I was rooting for them I said I might watch the game that doesn't mean I'm rooting for them. Of course not Okay, hey did you hear what they want to set up the top and plus I'm afraid to ask we need some help Okay, he was doing pretty weekly until he got to that now Here's a faction manette who says welcome back happy new year nice to have you back to talk here's a good one I enjoyed George for the first time Says a net how do you like that? There's starting to catch a little bit of slack not too much. Maybe it's because of the holidays Or maybe because you talked about what was it with the guy said before you talked about that he enjoyed so much I forgot looking asked that was it. I listened every day of the way to work on joy the articles you read on a radio I don't have time to read all those papers you keep me in form says it Wow, we'll see we'll see how it shakes out during the new year sweetheart Because so far today we don't have too many people call him in praying for those periodocles on audio We don't want to get a little Tommy jick all bent out of shape again. We want to do the show exactly the way Tom wants. Okay Remember Tommy wants he was pretty good driver hazel park pop at O park Good truck man 567. Oh 560 pound 560 on the AT&T what's wrong with sitting here in begging for calls all day? How for four hours for that kind of money. I'll do it. I got Boca Brian's checking my pocket here I know he would come in today. I know what kind of guy he is the way he operates Although I will say this all of the bits that he does that I can't play on a year Let's start to get a little expensive these days. Here's a call from Marguid. Hello Yes, sir happy new year to you and the same to you You know, I'm a season ticket holder for the fanters and I'm unfortunately been going here the one You haven't got a most of the games. I'm right up. I'm right up at the from you in one 19. Yeah Yeah, you know when I know why they're not what I need to be it's all about money I mean when papal burry gets trades 11 million dollars worth the payroll disappears What do they do with that 11 million dollars? Well, the thing that really it pisses me off is the fact that if they would have spent some amount money on just a couple of Free agents or a couple other players They they really could be competitive. I mean there only four points out of first in a week division right now If they would have kept Whitney if they would have kept Soldier even forgetting about getting anybody new if they would have just kept some of their really good players Number one to fans would have known who the damn team was a number two They could have been maybe even in first place right now With the matter with Gary and our Monday and they were out there for the grab or our Melambi sky all the best played great for the blues After they ended up doing nothing then up with a team that's got a lot of energy that the 23 24 years old They're not a bad team No, man, I keen the keen and is doing a great job with him. I mean you and people don't realize what a marvelous job He's doing with a very young and experienced team But the fact is with all the years of disappointment and frustration of public spins through here and for those kind of prices People don't want to see young and energetic. They want to see really competitive and team especially in home that can win some games Can you explain to me? I don't understand about the token why the sop aesthetic at home and why they really actually played damn well But you know something that may be the the age factor again because when they're at home They may you know feel a lot more pressure when you've got young and experienced kids on the team Maybe that's it because at home they've played scared. They're on their heels. They don't look good I mean the doubt the Dallas game last Friday. That was one of the worst games I've ever seen in my life That was pathetic. Yeah, a few more films like that and you'll hear an echo understand You know well obviously near there now that I'm back. I'll become a game I'll come over and say I like theoretical way I actually got every game. I sit and I pray but the end results pretty typical We know it's gonna be a tie and another time Yeah, right okay There's my good friend Tommy just came in. He's got some interesting reports.

Thanks for the years of entertaining us I'm from Martha's vineyard in the Patriots fan. All right David Right here it we may not have made the playoffs. We may have gotten screwed over by the jets there, but it's our own fault For blowing at second jet scheme and playing so crappy that the tent is seeking didn't even show up but nevertheless It says Tom Brady the Patriots quarterback play the entire second half of the dolphin game with a separated shorter never knew that did you know that? So much for being a pretty boy quarterback who isn't tough right how do you let in that That's the first I heard of that David Thanks so much we enjoy you so much that's a friend. Did you know that that Brady played the whole second half of the separated shorter in the dolphin game That's right you're not even out of sports nerdy. They've been hanging out with him too much I'm asking Volca Brian like he would know he would know Tom Brady from the Brady bunch The fact he wouldn't know the Brady bunch because that's right up his alley again all that old-scale TV that you see on Nickelodeon 5 6 7 0 5 what?

I see on the next Christopher little show Hello, come with me to Georgetown and Washington DC to see my toughest project yet decorating a typical Republican They're not like the Republicans over past more like the distant past Not my type but when you're living in a plutocracy I don't have much choice look at the bright side Maybe this will get me in a freight car with a nice corny treatment on the window Okay, sensible Republican lamb shades they like the ones made out of Jewish skin You gross isn't it that's the toughest part for me Then it's like much too dim with that orange yellow hue next to real mall, dingy Oh, well, I also get great not to judge Now I thought a nice man runner in the foyer would be a nice touch, but say for you men hair throws Not my style, but easy to shake out after wiping your feet here we are outside This rather important White House client of mine. I'm not mentioning any names Anyway, he wants a vintage lawn jockey on his lawn, but not the kind you think now this is a Republican half, so he wants to hire a Really grow the sensible Republican home on the next Christopher little show only on discovery channel 500 times a day Nor turn or should be. I'm sorry. We're talking to the man dog about thinking we're analyzing it Did you like that that they threw the ball three times there or two times that feed or you're a screw? They had to kill someone at clock therapy in man Exactly and especially Ricky is running like a wild man the one thing we know about the Patriots is they can't stop their run They cannot stop it to save their lives and are throwing a ball. That in the shadow of their own goal line Happy new year mad dog have a great show man It's good to see you look what about 70 ready. He's aged a lot since that game You know, he looked last time.
