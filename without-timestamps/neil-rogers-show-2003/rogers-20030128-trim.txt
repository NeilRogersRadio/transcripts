I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you. Why are you back with that? I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you. Why is that on here? I'll put on the air. Because he's fat. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, my, oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my. On the down and over here, rock. The side of who fades, I'm the beat of the clown. For how new you will make it. Who knows what is got in this mustache. Small pots and air cracks. He's got a few cans. And that you're ready to eat or prone to fritz. He made a sandwich. It's just a tan. Let's give a little light so he can see back. That is an American bomb. It's an American bomb. It's an American bomb. What's up with my son? I'm too weak. I'm for his mom. It's an American bomb. It's an American bomb. It's an American bomb. To keep him all in the war. Oh, my. Oh, my. We did it once before. We did it once before. But now you need some more. But these American bombs. It's an American bomb. It's an American bomb. It's an American bomb. It's an American bomb. It's an American bomb. What? We did it three, four. We had a great time around the building this morning for the first time that I in a long time. You know what? At a great time this morning. What? At a great time. Why is this morning any different from all the other morning? You'll hear it all the way. Have it a good time. Gildy and I were bonding. Zack and I. In fact, I actually go these. It's he's sandwich on a whole week bread. And if I wouldn't have eaten it, Zack would have eaten. That's why I kept him alive. It's actually good guy. But he's fat. And why is he on the air? That's our question today. Why is Zack on the sports sports sports? What does that mean? Yeah. Anybody who. And I can't believe that who you are. Fetching your Julio who's a great guy. And I like a lot. But can't believe he's offended because I called him fat. He's not just fat. He's like he prefers pleasantly plump is what he's like. Fat, fat, tub, will be a lose some more weight. He's doing atkins. Dr. Boba's on with Paul Osama's morning on CNN and he'd say that. No. He was on the regent. And fact, maybe that's why you and Dr. Boba got along so famously that time when we did that appearance. I didn't even talk to him. Well, you was me. We didn't talk to him. I was like the mumbles. I was like a little bit now. Didn't exchange a word because you're small potatoes. We always say, like, I don't know. I don't know. I had no brown. We had nothing to do with brown. I was just reporting what they. Why is that come here? Sports. Why are you on the ear? Can you explain that to me? He's good. He says. Thanks for the bacon by the way. And the cheese sandwich. That was great. Listen to me. Tomorrow when you get food. Of course tomorrow won't be a million around in the hallway. See, it's pleasant here when somebody's out sick. I don't want mention no names. But I call to her. But he knows we have like old times. Everybody had a good time this morning. Nobody's like walking on eggshells. Where to? Like watching her back. Watch your back, sack. That's what I'm hearing. I hope your mom's not listening. I want to get nervous. She's probably taking died. He's probably popping gavis gone like pence. But anyway. Huh? Why is he on the ear? He's a good guy. But he's terrible on the ear. He's like the board. He's like the big. He's another one. He's a good great guy. Sports. But is that it sports? He's like his capable and Troy Acmon is coming to the. I think if Dave wants that. Uh, made that call. I think you ought to be fired. If we can verify the day wants to call Troy the boy and invited him to come. First of all, what's Dave Feele got to think of? Oh, my god. Are good Jewish book from Dartmouth J. Feele with a big ears in the bad arm. What's he gonna think? He's gonna be pissed off and fired up. And you know, he peered well Dave wants that. It's a guy that got Ricky and he well. Great more power to him. But you know, one out of two is only 50% which ain't that good in football. You know, not too good. So if that's Troy your fire Dave, you're out. If you're tired if you're concerning with Troy the boy, because the last thing that we need the last thing and I say we that the dolphin fans want is a quarterback in order to say, now you could fill in a blanket like washed up. Old or whatever you like. I know what Carlos is in there thinking because he's he's. He's thinking gay. Yeah, that's what he's thinking. Here's a facts from Papua no part from our close personal friends Steve Wolf and Dick Findberg who just obsessed with this program. By the way, I lost money last night. Not a lot. Lost a few bucks. What? What are you looking at me like that for? See if I could have that 20 that I won off mad dog instead of giving it to Carl. If I would have known you're going to waste that money on buying faggotes out there, I would have kept it myself. How much is a cost for pack of cigarettes nowadays? I don't know. $2.75. Am I close? $3.3. $3.3. Three bucks for a pack of faggotes? A book. Stop and think about that. What? 20 in a pack? Yeah. That's more than a buck of peace. I mean, that's more than like 10 cents of peace. How much have come out to 10 bucks of peace? Seriously, that's ridiculous. If you took the three bucks for 20 faggotes and only got as a bunch of paper would bad chemicals in it by the way. Right. I think I don't think it's tobacco. I think it's the paper that it helps too. No, I'm Tonya. And the ammonia and the rat poop. If you get some good rappers and wrap your own like they do in Amsterdam, then you'd have like the higher quality more concentrated. It's probably more expensive. But here are finer cancer. A gigantic pristine tumor. Does that work all along for? It's not a tool. Remember in the movie the ace or the great Santine? Remember what his name was? Tu-tu-tu tumor? Number Ham? Yes. That was a good movie. I'm just, how come all such a good movie this morning? We don't want you to feel bad because I know you're listening. I hope that you're better at it. Which it'd be a bad help on anybody, although. But anyway, but we just had a good time. Like you said, we kind of old times like with the first team. Everybody friendly out there in the hallway. We have a nice little alcoe. You'll be soon to be handling it. Just fine in there and the show too. What the help of Zach and Robert, of course. Right. Of course with their fan ters to help in the course to help of how he's who I think brought all that good food in there. That's a good movie. I pretty sure was. That would be right. Whole wheat cheese sandwich. Very plain. Very all, I would honestly say all American. I would probably British. Yeah, but with lots of butter, which is why it was good. Why do you say lots of butter? Well, I tell you one thing. My brain's out right afterwards. It's the only way they make it. Just like at a fud rocker. Don't, if you got a sense of the stomach, don't need to fud rockers. I like their food a lot. But, yeah. They butter the bun. All the eaten Tom, don't butter the bun. Hold the butter. What fun is that? You ever come a hold the butter and they stand there holding it just like this? No. Anyway, here's this. In fact, see we could be having a great time in here every day on this radio station like the old times. But there's this, all right, you know, this is good that it happened. I hope he's feeling okay and he's back. Cause, you know, sometime in next month or two. But the fact of the matter is that there's like a dark cloud that hangs over this station. In these more hours. It's like, I guess it's not like this one. I'm out of town doing the show. What do you mean? But I mean here it's just now today was fantastic. Listen how much happy everybody is today. Everybody. Why don't you want to work in a workplace? It's a hostile environment where you come in everybody's peak in around a corner and are you going to have a close encounter with somebody who hates you like poison and you hate them and are you going to like say the wrong thing? You know, have to refer to all those, you know, what you're walking on the hallway. You have to like do the green apple quits that toward all the daggers that are going up and down the hall. Kills so people. Yeah, not to mention the water now. She's got her ear to the wall monitoring. Oh, this is such a pleasant day today. Little do we expect it. Anyway, the effect says, Dick wanted me to fancy is kind of playing a special match race in Pomp and O Park between. See more butts and Fox Valley Tushy. Those are two of the horses who are racing right now to track. See more butts. See more butts by the way. One of the great. I want to kind of say great, but one of the most prolific pornographers in history of the business. What do you think they got about 75,000 different titles out sea more butts? At least I can. And in back though, what do you mean you guess? It said that's almost as bad as the racian answer. Liberty well parked Joe Icor and calling back in the early 1980s. And Robert Silda Campbell has pulled out his little pickle in the center of the track and is out driving at home. Little pickles than any of the horse. Now can you imagine how much spare time somebody's got on her hands to be faxing with this kind of dribble? At least he didn't mention David Ingram today and quite practically I can see why. Don't take it personal, David. You're okay, but you're not getting our money. Anyway, big event tomorrow for George. Where are we probably missing? They hit a time. Oh, what a cold time. Join George tomorrow for happy hour at five to seven at treasure. I'm located off the pulmetro just north of the 122nd street exit. Stop by for prizes and drink specials tomorrow afternoon. And they'll probably see more butts will be there hanging it out. You'll see more butts if you go there. Probably. Then you do sit in a moment alone at home unless you got a mirror. So when we are faxed yesterday, I'm our pool. Whatever it is, we got a tremendous response about George unbelievable. See, I'm surprised about this because for somebody that's his vanilla and boring. And as George, you wouldn't think that we'd get that hostile. I mean, just in general, that emotional response, but you do generate a tremendous emotional response. Not necessarily a good one. But you can't have everything. Where would you put it? So we get to the results of that pool in a moment. Right, though. And then we got today's pool, which will be building because obviously. And we want to really thank Howard Cohen, the Miami Herald, for at least don't go out and buying a radio. The story was a piece of crap about all women all the time. South Florida's newer light FM breaks ground all female DJs. Does anybody we'd care about the DJs? I'd like to describe a nation to be light FM. And then is the one who wants to see who one of them is? No. Well, let me just say that she's a female DJ who used to be on Zeta. Come on, you must know who it is. By the way, we had a good time here this morning, stuff at her name is. Come on, you know who that is? The El Zeta. We used to be on Zeta. Well, I was there. She was on at night. Come on. Oh, I caught him, but. Kimba. Kimba. Oh, he Kimba. Kimba. Kinnasmas Macho, George, or Kimba. So she's on her own light FM. Oh, the boy. Oh, the boy. Hey, muff, by the way. You got a whole big story on light FM here in the Herald. Nothing about us. Nothing about the midday rating for being a raw female DJs. What's going to happen with Greg B. Tell. She don't count. Are you going to start picking on Greg? Why would I pick on Greg? Are good friend. I'll tell you why because I know that Greg hates you. 11 after nine at five, 60 WQL. All you guys out there with a new year in full swing right now. Now is the time to act on a new high paying career. How do we have a good time here today? Stay home, Mo. In fact, I don't know. Great idea. Why does these days do the show from home? The home of the studio in his house, just like they did for me in Toronto. They can build a student. But he's got all that. All that distance is shut down here from Boca. Build a nice little studio in his home. Fast rain is holding a free seminar this evening in its candle Miami for Lauderdale and Pembro Pines locations.

But what would happen if a wear wolf attacked something else? Come on, busy game to barn. Spicy whistling. Yes, you your rei your funnyTomie. A poor fire launcher. Red Hot Ducca Reckerangan Ot Yeah I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. All women, all the time, sufferers, light, fambrakes, new ground with the female DJ lineup. I mean, the idea that a bunch of right-wing assholes sitting up in New York or whatever to hell are broadcasting from that they're going to like manipulate us or have anything to do with this program in Miami? It's ludicrous on the face of it, on the face of it, so butt out. Find some real stuff to talk about. Yeah, like there's a few Pami Pinkos run on loose besides us. And here's a picture of the entire state of it. Here's Gokimba. Oh, and again, a great view now. Look at Grand Beauty. He don't look a day over 80 boy. Look at that. You mentioned his name and there's the picture. Now how does he fit into that? He wears a skirt to work. I guess. Does he really? I don't know. Maybe he's the PD. No, he's not the PD. The PD is some guy. Kevin Carter. Oh, no, he's from Idaho, the PD is. Rock, Jack. Kimba, I didn't read the whole thing because quite frankly it's boring itself. And they play slush music. Why would a station that plays slush music? Why would that be a big thing? That a station that plays the carpenters all day long or whatever it hell they play is got all female DJs. Nobody listens to the DJs on that station. Other than Kimba with her very heart and there's a picture of Kimba looking at where she puts that Julio to shame. What's he going about for 25 these days? She's a hooking woman. Kimba, make Kimba. You, Shwak. That's her whole stick. I'm looking for the name of the PD or how it is the Greg Butal fits in at light FM. Let's see the program director there. His name is something Sydney. Miss Sydney is a Sylvia Sydney. I don't know who it is. I don't have time to screw out of this. But on a picture there he is. There is Ellen Jaffy. Isn't she a magic reject Ellen Jaffy or was she on? Was she on? So though. Big, the day before was she on big. She was on the issue on something. Ron Phillips, I think he's the PD. And Buh, Gilgarten, Susan Wise, Ellen Jaffy and Greg Butal. How does she fit into it? I think that's an excellent question. Maybe somebody has the answer for us. How Greg Butal fits in on all female line up on light FM. Why would anybody write an article about that? And then not to be outdone. New times has got a big piece this week. Culture. That's KULCHUR. That's to be real. Oh, artsy, artsy. Uh, hip hop till you drop yet another self-loader radio station enters the fray this time on autopilot. And it's all about the MIB men in black used to be um, she was upon a time when it was a great station and then they bought the station and destroyed it. First packs and now cheap channel who destroy everything they touch. At least that's what KULCHURi says. KULCHURi is widely quoted in here. He says for Christ's sake everybody plays hip hop. Scoffs KULCHURi program director power 96.5. The chief army competition for WMI be along with the similarly hip hop R&B format. WEDR rank number one and two respectively audio audio. Noting the private functions is on air DJ's work curry continues. We have mixers who play at parties for major corporations here. The executive sitting there all over 30 and they're all adding play hip hop. Don't forget those 30 year olds have grown up with hip hop. It's nothing new to them anymore. Say homogenized worlders that a homogenized world. And that goes down about David Ross says this and David Ross said, that's that. It's sediment so on. We don't really care about that because we don't listen to hip hop. You listen hip hop. I'm trying to think about it if I do not. Isn't it tough question? Don't I? I wouldn't know. We got that kind of response. I would like to say the memo and writing about it. And we didn't remember the back. You could have emailed me. I don't make it a point to sometimes it's not. You listen to hip hop. Yeah, you know listen to hip hop. Don't give me that. Missy Elliott. That's okay. If when she comes on on TV. Do you really? It's got the bees and kind of a weird video. So anyway, I has nothing to do with us because I don't think anybody here really listens to you. Listen to WMI being now. We don't listen to men and black. Everybody vehemently shaking their head. Perfect Carlisves captures spun around like Linda Blair's head. And we don't listen to a light FM. No. In fact, even I'm far too much who would have ever to be listening to light FM, which I never. I wouldn't have to find it on the dial. 101.5. I have no idea. Well, no, it said that in the article. I don't listen to it. Well, I don't listen to it. Well, I don't listen to it. I don't listen to it. I don't listen to it. Well, I don't listen to it. Well, I don't listen to it. But pull. The pull about you. Why do you hate George so much? He's boring as Schmidt 45. 31.3%. Which yeah, I mean, that's something you can't help you. Just boring. That's just you. They're not holding it against you necessarily. They might. I don't hate him. He's okay. 364. And I don't hate him. I love George. 267. You put those two together. I got 48.7%. Nearly half. And what are you smoking about? Nearly half. Either, love George or say, he's okay. Now that means that a little bit more than half say something in the territory. As in he's boring as Schmidt 45.31%. He's an nasty little spick 100 and some people said that. Too much eating ass talk 51 people. He's an anti-Semite 41. Too much religion talk 31. And too much mumbling. The moon would like 25. Is what they be saying. So I think what they're trying to say is that George loses about 50% of the audience when he's on. We used to think it was a little less than that, but I think now that the real numbers are coming out. Slaying said to be soprano's imitation. Another show that I don't watch. Too young. This is set out of an aquelophonia. Too young men killed their mother and tried to cover their tracks by chopping off her head and hands. The way they saw it done on these sopranos authority city yesterday. Jason bought teased at 20 in this 15 year old half brother who was not identified because of his age and which half. We're arrested over the weekend for investigation of the murder's share of Michael Karona said. Karona refused to say where Jane and boutiste 41 was killed, but set up preliminary autopsy showed she was strangled. Her head and hands were found in the apartment she shared with her sons and Riverside East of LA. I don't know what motive you could possibly give for killing your mother Karona said. The family originally from Illinois moved to California six years ago and moved to the Riverside Department of About Six Months. A court of the share of boutiste was killed in this member Janey before a team. The sons allegedly tried to dump her body in ocean side. The next day were spotted by a security guard and ended up throwing the body in Norn's County, Reveen. The guard gave police the license number of Jason boutiste's car. Obviously a rocket scientist. Jason boutiste at this clerk at the holiday in the nontari was arrested at California State University in San Bernardino, January 24. Allegedly told investigators he and his brother lived with her mom but they hadn't seen her for weeks but soon confessed. But he's to also told investigators he'd seen an episode of his sopranos where he saw the same time of this member meant that it had been done before dumping a body. The brothers did this he said because they believe it would take away any identifying information that law enforcement could use. The Raman's scheduled for today. I'd like that real rocket scientist killed off mom. I mean I think a lot of us if we ever decided that the killer of mom would be a lot more clever than that, George. Yeah you cut the feet off too. Let's see Kimba is the resident and that's terrible. Call him Kimba like a bold something like a bull on the Chinese shop. That's what it said. When you people stopped picking on poor just because she has a deep voice and she looks you know like was that a bull it's in? That was a bull it's in. 5 6 7 0 5 6 you haven't given the police yet they're not going to call. They want to call about that we're not going to discuss that stupid thing. I mean we could but I wouldn't waste my time we don't recognize Fox news or hither. Or anybody that facts is about that. If you could see the ass sucking facts that's in there from the unmentsible one you know h h from wherever he's from this week. It's just amazing to me the mental illness that permeates this community. And it's scary. One day the fact just yesterday, facts is that was I don't read more than like two or three words seeing the lashing out about you mostly about little spick a jubba and all the other crap. And then today like well this morning I saw him fox we don't care okay don't understand we don't care we don't like you. We don't want to hear from you we can't stand you we find you anxious we wish that the air you breathe will be putrified by bull experiment.

I mean our pool why do I keep saying that I don't try to get my facts drape. Who is that we've done this before but it's fun we like doing this. And the audience likes doing it because they don't have to think too hard. Who is the hottest person that is public figure the reason I put public figure winner is because we don't want to say oh my very shorts down the road with an old from very shorts okay.

They just want to shout out. We're not doing a shout out. That's on the overnight show. I guess. Were they left there a little list of giving a shout out from this one of that one? I think what they really want is to hear us talk about how Dave wants to. I'd be fired. Didn't I already say that? If he really is trying to bring in Troy, I think men here. Old hack. Quarterback. Waiting to get sack. Got a problem with his crack. But anyway. I can't. I don't think this phone is working. Okay. And you know what? I'm right. That this phone is not working.

Carlos is uh, young. What? Nothing's happening on there. Oh, there you go. Finally. Just hit it with a sledgehammer. I'm telling you. Can't hurt. It'll make me feel a lot better. Just watching that thing blow up. I mean, I just knew that something had to be going on. What? Who's that? Who's that screaming on the phone to you? Because I can't hear them. Who is that? It's Joe. Joe, who? I can't put you on the line. Joe, my line called the hotline. We can't put you on on the hotline either because he can't. He can't put us in work. He can't put you up. What does he want? To say that it wasn't him. It wasn't any of his people. Bull crap. He would open the door last night. He would open the door last night. It wasn't him. Who else is in here overnight? Who else is in here overnight? Who else is in here overnight? I can't hear him. Yeah. Yeah. Don't say that for a dearer. We don't believe him. We don't believe you, Joe. Go back to bed. Look at lost. He used to be a good guy before he got married. Before I got the overnight show in any got married, and you put those two together and fight frankly. We don't want to see him any more either. So we had, first of all, doesn't really make a difference. The fact that a matter is that everybody in this building comes in here and dicks around. He's got it. It says in care about this. The audience is waiting here a radio show. And how long is this project that you're working on? How long is this going to take Carlos? Till about, but 1245? 1250, he said. 1253-40. Just until we go into the last break he said. Five minutes? It's going to take you five minutes to reboot the goddamn computer? Oh my god. Play some non-reco-comousal music and we go fair me. This is a jule music. Here's an interesting fact. It says from a listener in West Palm Beach. And this might be a good pull. Maybe we'll do it today instead of this one. Although we got Elizabeth Hurley, there are votes coming in on it. We'd add some other names what we can't talk to you. The hottest person in the world. Elizabeth Hurley, four Britney Spears, three Halle Berry, two Brad Pitt's got a pair. And a cornacolia's got a pair, which figures Carmen Lector and Penalty Cruze each have a pair. So you didn't like Penalty Cruze, I told you. She's got a pair. Okay, how about? Jale's got one. Just one big one. Kind of like a Mariah Carey in the middle of her chest. And Tom Brady's got one. I'd like to see it. Tom, while I'm sure it's the one, Cameron D. He doesn't have any. So that's only 19 votes on there because we're still little around with this. Because Carlos is still on the floor over here. Did it with our computer. Trying to get our phone to work? I just knew that on the worst possible day, it just couldn't be that bad. Because you were telling me that you were getting people off the air shouting names or whatever. I didn't see those lights light enough either. Nothing was happening. Oh, nothing. Nothing. No, let me say it again. Nothing. Which word did you understand? Zippity-Duda. Nothing. Not a call, not a blip, not a mark, not a check mark, not a squiggle, not a fart. Nothing. Nothing? Dead. The EDD. Dead. Like this taste is going to be pretty soon if we keep going up the way we are right now. Man. You know those people have said the jig is up or whatever they said a cue way on the other hand. That's cool. I think they may have had a point. Okay, here we go. We got a nice green screen on there. Here comes. It's re-looking, it's searching, it's sticking. It's farting around. There goes the little cursor, which I'm going to start out with a little cursor by the moment. Okay, here we go. Put in the password on there and get this goddamn thing going. Okay, let's get the rock and roll it. Just escape the right around it. Oh my god. This is the longest process I've ever seen in my life. I'll slow what age. Don't forget, join George tomorrow, Treasure Island. Happy our 5th of 7 am to noon right off the pulmetto. Just know the 22nd Street exit. Stop by for prizes and drink special. I treasure Island. Okay. When he said five minutes, I think he was underestimating. Anyway, this pool, please give me your vote on this pool. It says Neil. And what age should people stop wearing sport team jerseys? This is a pool you'd like a lot. He says I'm curious to hear your thoughts. These people drive me crazy at the bank in the store and at the workplace. And I'm just a few.

Even a character work in think of her. Let's line up up. Looked Lana up I would Tom and I in the middle sounds good to me of course being super man. He can probably do them both at the same time I've seen guys like that in the movies christian agolar has gotten on Jackie Johnson the channel said on whether chick who's the hottest weather chick in America's gotten on Charlie sterons got none Chris these just went on there Jennifer Garner alias got none alias Mooshie pupic tower banks none had their lockler now whole lot of them got none.

And I don't care what anybody else will tell you. Sting is like pass A for the people who are supposed to be in it. I mean, very healthy. What happened? What you want to go to? I don't know what I juice. That's not the point. The point is he was big long before most of those people were even old enough to have any concept before those people got stung. Stunk. So I don't know what he was doing in there. It's kind of like what they do with gulstrum. You know, we're glad it's night in the pimps. And Gary Puckett and Union Gap. And the 1910 Fruit Gum Company. I mean, quite frankly, nobody wants to see the 1910 Fruit Gum Company. Or Gary Puckett and Union Gap. Right? Or any of these people. So I don't know what to help people are thinking about. It would be like when we go to all music formats during tomorrow. Hey, listen, don't forget to Mars Wednesday, meaning from night. Well, we got to warn these people. 9 to 10 we're going to play all comedy, but it's because if they tune in that hour, I'll 10 of them. And they hear us doing that. What happened?

Wouldn't that be bad? No, seriously. I think there's like a corporate disease here. I think maybe a 20, 30 million dollar lawsuit straight in them out. Get an exterminator in here, get somebody to suck out the vents. This building is dangerous. Dangerous. Just get on an elevator. Huh? How would you like to have the money? How would you like to have the money in the bank? That they must have to bribe the inspectors to put those certificates in there. Oh, this was inspected by, you know, I don't want to mention no names, but that's Get serious. That thing couldn't pass inspection if you had a gun to the inspectors. But about 50 grand cash, small bills, that'll do it. How about Jennifer Conley and Nicole Kidman and Nicole Kidman? Are you kidding me? I'd rather vote for Trevor Kid. Nicole Kidman. She's better than Ann. It'll be crueys. No, she's not. Yes, she is. No, yeah. No, no way. No, no way. He doesn't like chocolate. Well, you don't like Kelly Buried, then I guess. Or what's your name?

Sherry Bellafondy Harper. Yeah. Oh, well, she married that last day. Harry Harper used to play for the Montreal Canadian. She let it drop that one. What about Jennifer Conley? Yeah. And I get Jennifer on there. Look at her. Look at her. Look at his head. Just rolling around there. Always been very beautiful until lately. And what happened to her later? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. She got hit by the emaciated stick. I see. She turned into a stick. I see. Maybe she's doing a Karen dive. Most gorgeous. Don Johnson from one of your devoted female listeners. Don's Johnson. Not any more honey. We're not talking about people. I used to look at a hundred years ago. Like, you know, Robert, we're a Wagner or Blake. You still look good? That was a joke. When was that? He's like, so did Larry Curley and Moe, probably a long time ago. Okay. That's the list we got so far. We're working with Billion. Who's the latest ones? Kisht Christian Crocodile Play. They know who that is. First of all, this isn't the smallville crowd. We pulled our audience before. We've stuck into a movie the old, the pool. And they would know smallville if you. If the WB was the only network that came in on our TV said. Heather Lockleard, Tara Banks, Charlize, Therron. Is it Charlie's there? Are you saying, actress? Yes. In one. Two days in the Valley, Devil's Advocate. Big Valley with Barbara Stam. I did it. Did you do the always come to Tony Dep. Oh, really? How come Johnny Dep's not on here? He's still was pretty good. So put him on there. He looks pretty good. He's got all those tattoos though, you know. For real tattoos? I guess. I haven't looked at that close in personal. I was right there. I had my hand around his shoulder and that picture, which I wish I was just going to hand that leather motorcycle jacket on and Zeta. Those are the days, baby, Zeta before I became an old fart. And when the real hot celebrities used to come in like him. He was enough. But for what? Enough for me. Enough to go around. Johnny Dep. That was before he became real real real big. And then thought you guys in Hallendale and Neil and everybody else, you know. He got too big for his riches. He had a love of jacket. He had a black leather like a motorcycle jacket. He was wearing it. And he wouldn't take his jacket off. And because we had all that food that we were always seeing in the morning on Zeta. And when the show ended at 10 o'clock, I had like, this is enormous dump. And I felt, I don't like it was wasting time that could be bonny. I mean, he was still there when I got out. You know, I made sure I washed my hands real good and put on some cash. Move over it. I got a barrage from the crow. What do you mean for a change? Oh, brother. Yeah, I was feeding the change. Maybe that's what I was doing there. I said it's a nice to Johnny Depp. I don't think so. Oh, he did look pretty name good. He was a very nice guy. He was not as good as a Stevie Bower. Let's put him on there. Not our buddy. He's a good guy. He's got his problems. But you know, right. He actually buddy. Yeah. Who doesn't Stevie Bower. Why? He to many shows with that towel. And I think affected his mind, you know. But if you could have seen the day at the hockey game in the old Miami arena when I first met him. Remember when that thing hold got set up? Yeah. And he approached me like he had just like my his long-loss best friend. I mean, he gave me a hug in a squeeze. I thought something was univerred. You're happening there. I'm serious. It was just amazing. What are you smoking about that? That's I'm not making that up. I'm not exaggerating. That's exactly how they went down. I wish Johnny Depp would have been quite that friendly, which he was friendly, but not that friendly. Because Johnny Depp dig to be very honest. Look better than Stevie Bower. He's had a long rocky road. Rocky road does sound good on it. You know something. We're not asking you anything about food, Mr. Because the audience is revolting about your taste. You are revolting. He don't like rocky road. And you want to know why? Because it's got chocolate in it. Right. And marshmallow. How can anybody? You don't like marshmallow? Okay. By itself. Okay. Why don't you just have a bowl of marshmallow ice cream? With it. Marshmallow topping. Yeah. Just put it in the... Just nuket. And we'll just fill it all over your forehead. It can like drip down your eyebrows. And then you don't have to see that stupid eyebrow ring. That stupid idiotic thing you were in in your eyebrow. You know, I left it in the bathroom one day on the counter. Oh, if you were... If you were in a friend, you would like to make that thing disappear so fast. You would have flustered down the toilet. Oh, it's teasing with it before I gave it back to her. You could have flustered down the toilet and if it came pop and back up again. It would have just thought it was one of five boys kidney stones. I dipped it in the toilet with a pair of tweezers before it. Yeah, there you go. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. 60, 5, 5, 6, 6, the ADHD and for eyes and wireless line. Poor little Carlos who takes a bath in the sink every morning, you're at QAM. But there's a lot of people still with no votes including Kristen Crook. She can't get any votes. How's Tom Walling doing? Brad Pitt has got nine. Tom Walling five, Tom Brady five. For the ladies and other... The real ladies and otherwise in the audience. Brad Pitt's no longer really contender, you know? He still looks okay. He's no old and old troll and old and... Watched out. Haven't seen it lately. Well, I'm gonna be more delighted during the break. I'll show you a picture in here. One of the tabloids, him and the watcher name. Not a lot of the watcher name. I thought a saw picture had a beard like ZZ top. Couldn't even tell it was him. He looked kind of like freaky Carlos last time I seen him. 27 after 10 at 5, 60, WC. By the way, freaky Carlos, you're real bitch. He's just really getting on my nerves walking out of here. I'm gonna destroy my great mood that I'm in now because of the fact that the ambiance in here is so wonderful this morning. But on a way out, make sure you leave here on a real serity note when you see that thing. That bitchy queen in the front desk. Hey, I'll tell you a place you'll be in a good mood because the food is so delicious and the... Services friendly and polite and a lot of fun. That's a pizza lot. Saw that the banner playing board. Can you imagine a money he's sped on that thing? He's probably feeding the guy for freaky, yeah? But pizza lot is world famous here in South Florida. They got two locations for it. The original Broward locations in Davy between university and the Griffin Rhodes. What is it? I mean between Griffin and 595, I'm university right beyond peer one imports. You know where it is in the pizza lot of plaza. And they got garlic rolls that a world famous to best you've ever had in your mouth. Three different kinds of great pizza. They got calzones. All the Italian dishes you know in love. Chicken and meal and seafood. Super subs. And of course all the pasta dishes are delicious and cooked. Fresh to order. No soggy. A pasta ever. At the world-flinging pizza lot. Three different kinds of great pizza too. And in plantation now we get a brand new pizza lot. It's right in the corner of Nampil and sunrise. Right beyond the world famous Walgreens. They're on the corner. And at little strip shopping center it's hard to see from the road. But believe me it's well worth zippin in the parking lot there. Goin in because the food is just as good as the original Broward location. Prices are just as very down unbelievably low. So you know how family can go their knee over and over and over again. For take out our delivery in Davy called 954 9168880. 954 9168880. And a plantation to brand new location. Now we're on sunrise call 3-8-2-1999. 954 3-8-2-1999. It doesn't get any better or cheaper or fresher or more spectacular. Then the world famous pizza lot. Now with two great Broward locations. We're sports radio 5-6. You A-M. Patriot. She gained a claim with her breakup performance in the people vessas Larry Flint. Now, Courtney Love takes the theater by storm, appearing in the classics at the Seattle Reptoy Playhouse. See her riveting performance is Lady McBeth in a Scottish play. Is this a mother f***ed jagger I see before me? As blanched to war in a street car named desire. I've always relied on the kindness of strangers. Suck her! And of course, Saint Joan by George Bernard Shaw. Get that towards away from me, mother f***ing f***ing fucking bastards! Yes, Courtney Love plays the classics. This spring at the Seattle Reptoy Playhouse. Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I have my f***ing face? Or are you a t***er today? Son of a f***ing mother f***ing f***ing. But she sure is lovely. 1031 at 560WQ and we got the mad dog along the Humperies in the studio. That's right, he's not here. I keep saying that. How did you hear any of you show yesterday? Quistier, listen. Did you hear any of it? Quistier was in Vegas. It sounded like he was right in that room. If I show some Toronto, sound as crystal clear as that, that weren't good shape. They do. So, what's the problem? Who's got a problem? Little bald head of Tom Jekko, but here to Son Sentinel, who's a geek? Oh, he's on a touch. Let me tell you something, Mr. Jekko. You haven't written anything about anything going on local in about 400 years, okay? And I'm out of touch with what's going on here. We just had a rating book come out, AMFMPM. Am I B as on a year now? What's the hero list discovered? We kicked ass again here in the middle of a grotesque book for this radio station. All the other things that are going on in radio and TV. Does he write about him? No, another you'll find another big puff piece today again about network craft. Anybody could write that from anywhere. They could be like on a moon. They could be on a ring of Saturn and write that crap. And he's got the hooks for the balls to be talking about. Well, it'll be hard for him to feel the pulse. You know, something Tom is hard for anybody to feel the pulse for and this time even their own. And you're part of the problem. This place is dead'sville. Brittany for love says Greg not not that Greg when I'm a good boy Sarah Serena for discipline when I'm a bad boy. Serena and the best of everything love Greg said not that not the one in not any of the other ones. We know so many of them these days. Here's one it says you might have mold growing in that building. I'm a mold inspector that building needs to have air sampling test done right away. Call me my cat yaddi yaddi yaddi able home inspections. He's got a phone number. What we can't do that is we're not authorized. It might not be economically expedient at this time. To do something about the death in the building, I'm tired of there's a definitely a disease in events. Sounds like a major major lawsuit. Ah, to me. Against the proprietors of this sick building, Lucy Lynn or that Lucy Lou, Lucy Lou, Lucy Lou, Lucy Lou, Charlie's angels. Is she Lou and make the old Lucy Lucy? Did the guy have a glasses die from Charlie's angels the guy, uh, the police chief? I don't know. You know the one with the thick lenses they they don't talk about. I don't know if he died. I think he died. Look it up Carlos. Look up the guy with a glasses from Charlie's angels. I'm pretty sure he died. He was in a lot of good stuff. I was a guy my nerves had a very annoying voice. Oh, T. Leonie. Who makes a hell of a macarony? You don't T. Leonie? What about her? You. Now Lucy Lou is she going on here? A lot of people like her. Okay. She's not. What do you do that to me? Because they make her out to me. I'm not asking you to try to listen to you. This can't all be the world accorded Georgian. You're a narrow taste. Sure can. Just like the guys that are on here. Do you think that I want to put, uh, who do I put on here? Like a red pit? Old meat man. Old meat. Lucy Lou's on and I know what about T. Leonie with her hot macarony. I know who she is. She's not ugly. I wouldn't call her hot. Not ugly. The question is who is the hottest person in the world in Georgia's. She's not ugly. Okay. So now there's let's make a list. This is we can do that. You think the other list ran along with a one of the opinion that we can do this from now on. She'll be under the contract. You can be ears. She's mediocre looking. She's not. I'm not putting her on her. The answer. No, adequate doesn't. Let me sit again. One more time. We first start again. We're hostile and photo on yesterday's pool again. Are they answering the question? The answer is no. No. No. The hottest person in the world. If she's the hottest person in the world, I will just stick to doing ourselves. What are you saying? I put asking me about that damn spot and about that guy saying, especially, okay? Who? I got nothing to do with that. How about LL Cool Jay? Somebody says, what do you say to that? Sure. Now, I'll tell you, oh, this is Captain working again. I think it's had a little bit too much this morning. Maybe Captain Rick is that crazy guy that calls. You know, when I was referred to as the crazy guy that we had on well back, I don't know. Look at the handwriting here. I think Captain Rick is losing it. Aubrey Harmon. Who is that? Is that a guy? I know. Well, maybe it is. Jason C. Horn football player. Oh, she's Jason C. Horn's wife is the hottest Aubrey Harmon though idea. Is she akin to like Donnie Harmon, Tom Harmon? Now, Tom Harmon's son, Mark Harman was Mark Harmon. Very good. And he was married to Florence Anderson. What did they have to do with Rick Nelson? Wasn't Rick Nelson married to his sister? I don't know. Huh? And then Rick Nelson died in a plane crash because he was doing something on the plane. And his kids didn't know the other day. So kids drew real long here and I had a monochrome and I said, no, they don't sleep naked together. They want to beat me up. And what else? They had that means. But what did Mark Harmon have to do with that? Well, he was married to whom? Who was doing who? Then Nelson kids were doing each other. And Aussie was doing Harriet. And who was Mark Harmon? Mark Harmon was football player. You see a lake quarterback. See, I know a little bit about football. Okay, all you assholes out there to think I'm not a because I'm an old fag. Sorry. What I forgot about sports would make me dangerous on this station if I remembered it. And here comes Francis over here on the outside with Bucky Dale. Oh, sorry. Let's go back and talk harness racing from 1960 and Hazel Park. Okay. Let's talk about some of those great looking harness racing drivers. Like Terry Morgan used to be about 30 years ago when he could drive. Oh, sorry Terry. Let's see, Captain Rick says, of Aubrey Harmon. Okay. Facts are coming in. The votes are pouring in on there. Although a lot of people still don't have any, which makes me consistently wonder why do people nominate these people on every poor all the time. Nobody ever gets any votes. Anyone know why? Because they look into pool and say, Oh, I'm voting for Brittany. Although I did call in about the Kristen, but I'm voting for Brittany. So what do you call in for Kristen and dammit? The Kristen have any votes yet? Oh, almost everybody's got at least one now. Like I said, the audience is really turning on to this 282 votes. Nicholas, she's got none. I should have voted for Nick. He sure's a hell of a lot hotter than Brad Pitt. Well, what do you give me a look like that? What do you, what do you like? You've seen her understand what that means. You don't understand it. Just because he is facing gotta, uh, proboscis. He's hot. Do you understand if you ever seen him naked? I have close to it. Very close to it. Not close enough, but. Uh, Tyre banks don't have any and good. The Kristen and Agalera don't have any. Oh, thank God. That restores my faith a little bit in the human race. Oh, I know. Oh, geez. Put out the cheese. Please. Geez. Louise. Kristen and Agalera. Don't get sucked in by the hype. Okay. It's one thing we get sucked in. But don't get sucked in by the hype. It's Angie Harman. People want me to tell you. Well, his handwriting looks like he's, uh, been doing acid with Dick Findery. He must have gotten the same shipment. So we're putting that on our Angie Harmon. Jay Swald Jason Seahor. Now is it what's it? Who's he? See a football player or basketball player? Jay, it says giant. Oh, that's right. Jason Seahor plays it. What do I know? I told you an awesome about sports. Angie, what? Harmon. Okay. Let me give it a list. We got so far because we got a lot of people to him in stream because, you know, they didn't realize guilty was on by himself this morning. Who is the hottest person public figure? Not your wife, not your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your sister, or law. We're talking about public figures. Somebody celebrity, I'm a jack, somebody like that in the world. Talk on a january, no way, honey, hear you yet. Whitney Spears, Halle Berry, Brad Pitt. You think, uh, you think they really had something going january, no one's such your Jean? I haven't played that in so long. I've got to play that today. Don't ever forget Sister Jean, please. It must be played. Did you see the picture of Brittany? No, Angie. Harmon. And the look you gave me was like, uh, compared to some of the other ones on the list. So we were saying, no, they both say cross around. Okay, cross around Eric. Not Angie right off the list right now. If I Jason C. Or I think it's pretty or she is. He's not a bad looking guy. Brittany Spears, Halle Berry, Brad Pitt, J. L. Tom Welling. Tom Brady. Never Tom Brady when a super bowl of the Patriots last year? Oh, good. No, that wasn't what I wanted. What we wanted was, uh, an accorded cova, Carmen Electra, which George thinks he's not too hot. The worm has been there. I wouldn't be surprised. Well, the worm's been all over on Saturday. The fact the worm is still around. It's one of the stories on our website. Beware of the worm. It is with Hurley, Sharon Stone. The little old, but nevertheless, she's doing okay. She's holding her own. Carmen Diaz. Penelope Cruz, which George is violent about that. Jessica Simpson, you ought to be pleased she's on here. Yeah. Why you sure turned fast. I thought she was spectacular and hot and everything like she's just, you said she looked great in person that she was a lot better looking than her pictures. And that you would have done her right here on the tabletop. Yeah. Oh, Shania Twain. Katherine Zeta Jones is married to Michael Douglas who thinks he's a real sex pie.

Yeah. Who else was on there? Rick Springfield was on there. Really? And who was in his bed? What is that? What kind of a look is that? Rick Springfield. Rick. I would just think about his music. When you say Rick Springfield, I think about his music. What would you expect me to think about his face? That great sci-fi show he was in for about five minutes. They killed him off on the first episode, which is a bad mistake. Battle star Galifika was not the one that's a boring, boring green. And now he's dead. That'll teach him to kill off her Springfield on the first episode. Back in those days, Rick Springfield look like a fine American. Okay. You don't think he was exact. Huh? How could you possibly say that? Even though it's true. Let's see. You also start in Steven Spielberg, short lived TV series called Earth 2. He also guest started in six episodes of Mel Road Place. And when she played Heather Lockleier's husband, he has a- What about the guy speaking to guys that Mel Road Place? What was that guy? Oh, no guy. No, there was a guy Mel Road's place.

Maybe can we go back? No. You might have run this about Detroit because it's so sad. Oh, oh. If you have air sampling done in your office for about approximately 250 bucks, it says you'll have documentation to sue the Schmidt out of these assholes that run your building. Says Mike. PSW some guy named George with a J. Don't take it personal for hate. But this guy says, who of course has got his business that and we appreciate his efforts to save our lives. He says don't use a guy named Jorge. Right. Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Good morning. Yes, sir, brings to you. What did it make you come in a time check? Is that all right? Well, what before you do that? Here's somebody says a young guy not's. I guess when he was about 10. Come check us or other tune that is column on Sunday or Saturday. Said that the reality shows we may not like them. We'll be gone in a year completely. And we won't see them for another 20 or 30. They're just getting going. I know. I use out of his mind. Not that I like him either, but let's face it. They're just getting going. They're going on for years and then. Yeah. The name I have for George is Monica Bulucci. She's a foreign actress in Middle East. She was in Malina. And she's with a Jean hack with movie. She's a small time. She's in a new room. She's with a dark hair in the large breast. Yes. Yes. How you spell her last name? You see the eye. Just like it sounds. Oh, Bellucci. Bellucci. Good call. Belli Sima. Okay. Ratsia. He's a nobody. No, who that is called. He's a little less. Ratsia. What? Nobody's going to know who won. So, Boge, I got put next to it. Nothing. We can name some movies that she's been in. Well, okay. We just described Monica Bulucci. Okay. We love. I love those Italian names. What was that movie cinema? Perdi so? I love that movie too. Yeah. Yeah. With the urine, the kid peeing in the gutter. And it comes out the Gargoyle's mouth. Yeah. It was a little bit. Five, six, seven, five, sixty pound, five, sixty on the AT&T and Verizon. Lyrless line. See, I didn't realize it. You should probably whip me with a new door. Some, but I haven't been taking these people's calls because these factors are just pouring in. They're called in between the era quality thing. And between the other. The poll. And between little Jerry who's out of control today, who's today's Steve with 75 little cost-effective taxes, none of which do I read by the way they all go in the Schmidt can for the squeele little writing. Seriously, the fax machine, I wish the audience could see it because it is such incredible tangible evidence of the state of mental health in this town. You can't complain about this, table mental health because there isn't any. It's like you were open to window and you hear them going, but you see, and network they were all going, I'm mad or in hell, I'm not going to take any more. You open to window out here and you hear, but look like that. It's all our facts people. I would say that the calls that we get are light years ahead of what we get on the fax machine. The people most of them on the fax machine aren't, they're not up to calling. Oh, their voice might be recognized. No, if not just that, I don't think they can make dial that many digits consecutively. They're totally the fax number, somebody's doing it for them. You got that little Jerry with a squiggly who's like out of control today, just psychotic. Know is that none of his facts is ever get read. Harvey from the hunger, whos in his stereo over Fox News, first of all Harvey from hunger, what you watch in Fox News for in the first place this morning, Jack asked, apparently a lot of people were. What do you mean by that? All the calls. All doesn't that sad. Yeah. Evidently, they care a lot more than we do because I couldn't give a crap less. And we got fat boys neighbor Dave who needs desperate help. Desperate help. You got Joey aka Tracy Foster who faxes everybody in the building and has since the day we ever said foot in the building. I'm sure before that. It writes with a crayon. Right. So in other words, on a facet generally when you look at a facet machine it just looks back and you goes, like pan you know what's on there. Here's a call from Delray B. Chela. Yes sir. Yeah, I'm surprised he charges up the fake hell on your list. Faith hell. And I'm a man. Yeah, a little faith. I don't want to just any names for what it's worth. That's true. George is just he says. He says, siring as we go long way. Didn't know that he did some in any. You over said go in the anyway so. Yeah. I got to tell you George is right though. And that will be a cruise. I know she's getting votes but oh god. She is so pitifully ugly. Well how about Christine Agalera? Well she's not getting too ready votes so you know. Thank God for that. At least there's some hope out there. Are you there? Yeah. Anyway, you guys have a great day. Please just talk and we're there. Thanks a lot. Okay. Okay. Okay. I don't want to play the rejoin again. Have it come up like dead ear. I don't want my brother coming out of that. The T-Rom would just his T-Bag hanging in his hand. So here's an album put these all up here. And you decide who you want to have come in your check the year out. And that will just sue everybody. Minions. We'll let stuff decide. Well let stuff decide. Well, what's he got to do with it? You think you think this company is going to spend money to check the year quality out here. But let's make sure they know they don't on the building. They make decisions about who comes in here and does things. That's what you think, Mr. See now that I'm back down here. I'm stepping in and I'm playing Bouch Boss for a little while. Don't you remember that what we had over there at the IOD? Of course. If you could have seen the pictures of the stuff that they sucked out of the events in that building, mountains it looked like Mount Rushmore, mountains of Mung. Huge enormous chunks of crap that have been that building in the events for like 100 years. That has never been to a tall giraffe. Oh my god. And we're sitting in there and everybody in the building had corporate disease at IOD. Coffee and theory eyes and blurry and then of course when they sold his way. Maximly we really had theory eyes. To we realized that they had much better equipment than they were going to pay me off for so much. And then we said, oh right. Yeah. Then all of a sudden tears went away. Maybe there were tears of joy. That a lot of good freebies at Pax and two. Who did that song, tears of joy? How about tears for fears or tears of a clown or tears in heaven? Yeah. Tears and heaven I like. Twenty-tuned and let's do some music shows. Yeah, just a piss off time. It wants us to save the world from the right wing which we can't play. Tracks of my tears. Smoky.
