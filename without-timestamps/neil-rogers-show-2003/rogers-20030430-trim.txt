Aaaaaaming! Coming soon to a theater near you! Christopher Reeve is Superman, Superman 5! No, help! Superman Superman Quint! To me, Olson is charming! Hey, you're a Superman, here he comes! He's in a wheelchair! Hurry up, Superman! Oh, come on! Okay, we're as German! Oh, you late! Yeah, that'll call you super-gimp! Do you matter, you freak? Oh, oh, Clark! Nothing's happening! Get on top of me! Arter! Ow! Or the evil song of widely fitted outer ways would you make Superman? Hey, with, with Kryptonite? No, steps! Superman 5, the search for a bigger doorway, rolling into a theater near you! Poor Superman man, last night's park camp was... Faaaming! Oh, all that big simist. Boy, some of you people must be really desperate. Oh, Neil! All that breakfast calls we were getting out. But he was gonna see a time-wally naked than I'd on the small fill, yeah. Right. Came out of that blast for an assfaming. And then, uh... Yeah, little, uh... What did we see, huh? Maybe a little... Back home! Side home! But she... Only the most desperate of the desperate were sitting there like with their nose glued to the screen. Probably still can't get it off, and the nose either. Tony right now, he had a mold this morning was all whipped up to our friends and him and guilty. I guess there must be nothing going on in sports. Certainly nothing that they would want to talk about. So they're talking about the athletes' fridayizing. Now, who's the one that pitched an old hitter? Because I didn't see about that. Was it... I don't know who was. Was it Tom Glamon? It must have been, so the other meds. Yeah, Glamon. So I guess he got calls from a Greg Maddox and John Smoltz as former teammates. Congratually, in him, which I see absolutely nothing wrong with that. That all. I mean, when you watch an NFL game, and the thing that really gets me is, here's the voice of the dolphins and his little assucking buddy there. And they're the NFL, the real, I mean, that's the bread and butter with this radio station. Let's face it as far as sports beside this show. And after every single game in NFL, every one of them. The game is over, the referee blows off his thing, and that's it. And at midfield, as the two teams are crossing the field, go to locker rooms and shower with each other with their own teammates anyway. Uh, you see dozens of guys, well, maybe that doesn't, but a whole bunch of guys from opposing teams who are good friends, maybe they went to college together, maybe they took showers together, who knows what the story is and they fraternize. And they go over to each other's house for dinner, like someone leaves one to Kujo's house before they came in Detroit, and there was a big difference about that. That's life. This isn't war. Like Alex Vandermok, killing would say, this isn't war. We're talking about it's a game you idiots you morons. It's a freaking game. Oh, that's wrong. He should be in Gellies all in dignity and pissed off and fired up. And of course, the same thing could be said of WQA, about sports stations, about radio stations in general, since I'm finding out some real, real interesting information this morning. A little bird told me, and that fact it was like pecking on a window this morning, it was like a little pecking on my window. Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, a little bird told me. And he said, can you believe that John Weener, who used to be one of the sports nerds at QAM, who's a pretty decent guy got a horrible voice, and doesn't belong in here just to say, hello, how you doing? But anyway, he's over there doing morons on a fox, make believe sports radio, which has got like fractional numbers. I mean, there you could put their audience in a phone booth, you could put their audience in that deliated last Saturday, and have room left over. That's how small it is. And so we don't wish him any ill John Weener, and if I was Moe, I'd be pretty poor doctor to find out, come to find out that there are people inside our building. I don't want to mention that one of them is our program director, who is a former roommate of John, whatever it name is Weener, a former Weener lover. And that these people are feeding him information. If he needs a phone number, if he wants to get some athlete or some agent on a phone or some hot shot in sports, all he's got to do is call over to QAM, and we're like feeding them all the information. And this is the guy who's competing with us. So Moe, if you're going to be upset about something, I'd be a lot less concerned about these athletes, and a lot more concerned about what's happening right in your own backyard, right in your own backyard. That's what I'd be concerned about. There's probably some infiltration into his smelly old bag wouldn't surprise me. Probably John Weener knows the flavor, he knows which piece Moe wore to work this morning. He's got all this info because he's got his inside spies, including his former roommate, Clarence, aka Zero, a Josh, whatever his name is. The program director, that's disgraceful. I mean, I've had friends with Bill Carter was working with IOD, I was working at WINZ, whatever, under different stations. Still, we're best friends, we go to the track together. We'd bitch about management, how they all suck stuff like that. That's allowed. As long as nobody hears it. But other than that, we certainly were like trying to feed each other materials so we can put it on the ear. Then I'd stay like I help each other show. There's still a competitiveness. But the idea that we have people inside the QA in building there. In fact, Greg was walking around a couple years ago, running, who's the Moe, who's the Moe? You got more than Moe's in there, man. You got like, skabies. Right? I mean, I got a little Moe over that one eyebrow there that you're always screaming about. You know, something that's me. I went to the German town just to get a role you said forget about it. You said, leave a worse mark than they already got there. You're looking even worse if that's possible. Well, I don't want to do that. I'm already looking pretty crappy. I don't want to look any worse. Not just they've been going with life. Right. So it's I got a Moe, but I mean, just a little thing. But as skabies, that's nasty. You can smell a man. They're all over the place. That's where we got a QA. I'm not just the Moe. We got skabies. At least working on conjunction with the competition. Huh? Chickers are worse. I'll start with that crap again. Please. Now, look at this. Why did you fetch me this? Why don't you stop? And Mary Poppins, Timmy. We're going to send that Santa Claus. We're going to send a Moe down your chimney. We're going to have them stick his bag down your chimney. If you don't cut the crap, whoever affects this nonsense. Idea for a poll. Look at what they stole. Who's the biggest proverb? Bill Clinton, Who they who sane? Hank Oldberg or George Rodriguez. Now, who did Ode have a picture of? The twin. Oh, the twin. What's this dude? That's right. I mean, he ambushes. Sorry, excuse me. The bush. The bush. The bush. Yeah, that's the true spirit. We had one of our stories that we have on a website. Is it not? Yeah. I believe we have it. Yep. Ode. Ode said holy families. Look at those. That's what he said. You know, those Iraqis are big and tumali. In fact, that's probably going to be the first fast food joint. Not too late here. We're going to open the right. Pete. What was it? Pizza Hut? What was the other one? McDonald's. What? Whatever. They'll die. If we didn't get them with the gunfire or the bombs, we're certainly going to get them with the fast food. The slow and more painful and torturous way. Terranir Kishkizah, Terranir Gutsah, with that American fast food. And lots and lots of sodas would have a duty sugar. So that's probably yesterday. Now I do realize that there was some tinkering going on here. There was some Grant tinkering going on with the poll overnight. Because when I went to bed last night, Cathy Bates for her performance. I'm here's the question. What was the best all-time performance in a movie by an actress? Cathy Bates was a couple of votes ahead. I get up this morning in Halle Berry and Monsters Ball is a bunch of votes ahead. I would say, But third in me. Yeah, third in me. Thirty seven to be more exact. And I realized that there was Dillon going on. But you know something I don't care because I don't mind Halle Berry winning. Do you? No, not at all. This kind of... I know you like Halle Berry. And that's what? This crowd, this audience. Whenever we take the, uh, whose hot polls and everything she always does really well with that winning. The poll question was, What was the best all-time performance in a movie by an actress? Not whose hot. I know. Not whose bones would be like a hop-up. But you know how they are. They vote for who they like. Cali Berry Monsters Ball 157. Well, I don't imagine too many of your anxious to hop on Cathy Bates. But knowing our crowd is probably a few. It'd be a soft landing. Cathy Bates and Misery 120. Now, you've sent, uh, I'll see. I'll see. That one, boy. You know something? He really looked old and I movie, you know what? James Kyle. Oh, that brains will all be a nice time to leave soon. Seriously, I'm just thinking, what year was Misery? Because the godfather, the godfather, the godfather, the one was 72 or three. Said he'd be cleverly. Huh? Misery had to be like late 80s early 90s. Carlos is looking it up. No, I'll look it up. Just relax being a boy. Don't do it too much work. They're got my big fat fat one here, my book. And by the way, quick call of people fat, Zack. It's one thing if I call people fat, because I'm a fat slob, but you, now you make me look like minimous. 1990, Misery. Directed by Rob Reiner. Meet him. Did you know that? I do know. There you go. See, it's not even nine 15 yet. We're learning crap on the world famous near Rajasho. How do you like that? It is Wednesday, by the way, and you probably forgot about that. No, I didn't actually. Oh, they're big noon to one. You're coming to the tower. Wednesday, this is what helps keep the show going. It's the only thing that keeps me alive. It's the fact we get that little bump in the middle of the week. That, you know, the bump that gets you over to hump. And leaves a lump. It makes you take a big dump. Right, on a stomp. James Concante, baits Richard Farmsworth, Francis Sternhagen, Lauren Vecal. Lauren Vecal was in Misery. Boy, that forgot. What role does she play? I'm going to have to get that again. I'm going to go out and get that today along with Fargo. And a pair of signs. There's a movie called Pierre Sauticona. There is? No. Ah. Who? Edward. I'm getting it. Also.

Kathleen Turner and body heat 48. Vivienne Lee, gone with the wind 47. Yeah, and I told you this wouldn't get as many votes as much response as the other one. And it didn't. It's just that sexist thing again. Right. Catherine Hepburn, the African Queen, the Johnny Mathister, a 43. Fade down away from mommy, dearest 41. Betty Davis, whatever happened to baby Jane 35.

It came up to where Nikape was great. The poor bobobobobo, Billy bobobo, bibit. And then the Cheyere, everybody that movie was great. The Cheyere was a hoot the Indian. Right. And of course Jack Nicholson, we missed the poll from yesterday. Jack Nicholson, one for Cookus Nest, is best meal performance in a movie. He won the Estatute. Sally Field, civil 28, Pellary Swank, boys don't cry 24. We love Hillary Swank. Hahaha. Liz Taylor, who's afraid of Virginia's wolf 23. Audrey Hepburn, breakfast activities 18, Jody Foster for the accused 18. Jessica Tandy, driving Miss Daisy 17. And bankrupt in Fatsau. 17. How do you know, and that was a late edition, wasn't about course they all went up at the same time. I mean that was like an afterthought. You wait for Yoni? Yeah. She was great. Especially the scene at the beginning where they're brewing the fat cousin. Yeah. And she's oh, their casket is open and they see the body's line of his big tub. Kind of looks like that. She's feeling. You said I'm a bitch. You remember that? That was great. We told you don't eat. Don't eat. He always said something good on you know. He always said food on him. Oh, god. What a great movie. But only us fat people really appreciate it. Right, Zack, you tub a crap quick. Pick an unjust treatment. I'll understand Josh is bigger than an apartment complex. And if I can make you the complex about it, let's tick on him a lot just for the Hellow bit because you hate him like poison. See, you notice the silence? Yeah. Well, we know you do. I don't know what it is. So you hate him. Well, yeah. You despise him. Here's a prick. You mentioned it. Yeah. 914. It's five. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. And 42,000 BTUs offer a great low price.

I don't care because it was very emotional moment. Did it go on here? No. It didn't? No. Didn't hear it in here? But that is me. It bleeds through on the air. This intercom thing. But I don't like that. Our engineer Julio is a great guy. And the last 25 pounds thanks to me embarrassing him. Because he's I would like to see him live long. He got screwed over by Bob the move on our engineering mafia at QAM. Not too many days ago. I mentioned that somebody had sent me some memos. Some that were posted and hiring three different positions in engineering. And I said the Georgia said, I don't think they're going to be hiring three new engineers. And come to find out this was just a formalities to enable them to lower everybody's salary. Including lowering Julio's at a much much reduced rate. And of course, there's the way of squeezing them out. You know, rather than going to him and saying, hey, guess what we do. The times are tough. We can't afford to pay you're eating too much or anything like that. And that would have been too honest. So instead they blow him out. So I wish him an investor like this. Because he's a great guy. He was up here and really did a lot of work finishing touches put in the studio together. Bob removed the runner round and circles as usual. Bob removed that. I just want to tell you man, this is one more nail in your coffin. In fact, this really inspires me to go on here until a full story about how you call the Beesley's a bunch of mudwamps that night in Amsterdam at that Indonesian dinner. He said that the kid in the tree in deliverance. He said, we even let them in there. That's what he said. He said that if the Beesley's would have climbed in the tree, he'd have hopped out because they would have ruined the neighborhood. That's what he said about them. I haven't even told you what he said about screw-in. And, uh, yeah. But I'll get to it. Because you're really small potatoes for most of your real idiot. And of course, look at that great job. He did putting that stuff in Amsterdam. Oh, my God. There's a story. There's a story. Of course, they only had what six months advanced notice to get that thing in there. Yeah. That's why it goes remote. And then he finally just threw up his arms in here and left it all the poor mark that Mark in the dark that that's guy was running around in circles trying to find the red light district. Anyway, let me, well, before we do that, because I want to finish up the results from the pool, then we'll get the new one. Lots of stuff, baby. Lots of stuff to squeeze in only three hours to that's the problem. We box it. Oh, look at that. Look at that. I pitched about engineering and now my phone lines went down. I don't think that's a coincidence. I think somebody's watching you around back there. You see that? No dots. I don't know. But we have a little, a little burp here a couple seconds ago. I think they really. A lightning strike. Yeah, let me see what's going on here. I think it's sabotage myself. Let me redo this thing. Ah, shit. Associate producer, okay. My thing is back on here. Do I see any dots? Oh, yeah. There they go. Oh, told you. Well, I'm a pro with this now. I have to do my own engineering here. Sure, it's not good. I'm called George Corsa or Bob for most because between the two of them. That's what you get. So nice going squeeze not the only guy that we had that we didn't know what that was doing as Julio. They're really care. Used to stick his big fat head in the door every morning, eight, forty five. Everything okay in here guys. You need anything. That's probably why they didn't like them too because he was actually helping us try to get our technical act together, which they don't like. Since this show is reviled and hated, even though I'm giving those hour by hours and I'm going to hear again. Why not? Why not? Huh? The four highest hours by far on WQM and the winner book are between nine and one by far. I just mentioned that in passing again, Greg. I just mentioned that in passing. Okay. And you two, Mo, you ought to be real. You ought to be in fact motion turn around on his way to vocation turn right around a minute where he is right now and go right back and pitch a fit with clearance. Sure was peace at him. For goodness. No seriously for concerning with the enemy for John Weiner. I'd be I'd be full minute them out. I mean at least the show's got him midday. I don't think you roll me is calling up to get information about sports numbers from clearance or anybody else at QM. But to think that they got this punk who doesn't belong on here just to say hello John Weiner there in a morning on Fox Sports on Schloss Sports was just cheap channel by the way. And we got people sleeping with the enemy. Didn't you say they were roommates? Huh? Or do you say womb mates? No. Concerning with the enemy man Judeo Roberts is pretty porked off and pissed up about it too. How do you like that? She's porked off and pissed up. A rope. US troops, speaking of people pissed off. Falugia Iraq. US troops open fire on anti-American demonstrators for the second time this week. As Iraqi's marched Wednesday to protest the previous shooting. In other words they're just pre-app. Protest me in previous ones. Wow you didn't like that one? There's another one for you. Right. The city's mayor said two more people were killed in 14 more wounded in the clash. And Army officers said soldiers in a convoy passing them. The men's traders were shot at and then returned fire. The gunfire came less than 48 hours after a shooting during demonstration Monday night. That hospital official some killed at least 13 Iraqis wounded at least 75. This is not one of those isolated. It's a snack with pieces of the fallout from the north. And now more collateral damage. But this week, man, we're going to have a big celebration. Then a president's going to make it official announced the war's over. They had a rummy over there walking around in the palaces. Sticking gold jewelry and his wallet. You see that? Yeah. He was sticking stuff in his pockets. Like a shop lifter. And bankrupt had 17. I want to give the whole list for them. So upset for poor Olivia to have one. And the state didn't have any. Would somebody please cast a vote please? I beg you. Let me see if she still got. Now she still got the big. That's bad. Holly Hunter raising Arizona 15. We'll be Goldberg to come up purple and glorious once in sunset Boulevard 14. Gloria Swanson and see the problem with this poll. Most of these are too old. As opposed to the actors we had. Now some of the actors were fairly old, but a lot more recent ones. But these most of them are pretty old. Don't you think? Yeah. Oh yeah. I mean, how many people in this audience are old enough to have seen sunset Boulevard Begorya Swanson? That's it. And that's it. And that's it. That's 14 votes. And she Dickinson dressed to kill 12. Jody Foster, Nell, 12. And you know who we forgot because I and Keaton had 11 for the godfather. You know who we forgot from the godfather? Tell you, Shire. Right. Yeah. Good. Connie. Right.

Sissy Spocktack, a space deck for Kerry at seven. She play hockey. Juliet Lewis for California and Diane Woodward three faces of Eve and Fay D'O'Way for Network and to be at least be currently Desiree's head six. Fay D'O'Way only had six votes for her job working and network for that. Oh, no. I told you they don't like that movie and don't give me a song to dance about. They don't like Sydney, limit and away it's shot. Okay. Somebody ought to be shot. What's wrong with these people? One of the top five movies in the history of the human race. And it's not debatable. I don't give a crap on anybody. Say that's not my opinion. That's a fact. Is there anybody wants to dispute that? No. Carlos Carlos never saw. Yeah, he raised his hand. They put it back down again real quick. Did you see that movie? No. So, so, so, so. What am I getting excited about? So get excited. Punk okay. That's got flees crawling all over him. That's what he admitted that this morning. He said just picked a flea off. He's trying to blame the building. Greg, he's trying to blame that. The fact you don't have an exterminator there. Well, we did just have a take your kid to work day. Oh, there he is. We anything would need an end building. It's an exterminator. Uh-oh. Lea Ramick days of wine and roses five. Sicily, Tyson, the autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman and Diana Ross Lady sings the blues. Any good bourbon spell, don't end a movie to have a little day, but they're boots on at four. Did anybody vote for Olivia and the snake pit? I mean, it was 100 years ago, 1952. She got a vote yet? Yes, you got one. Let's hear it. Oh. Thank you. Thank you so much. Olivia would have appreciated it. She's dead. I'm sure. Even Mary St. North by Northwest and Good Birdman, Gashlight, Jane Father, China Syndrome, Judy Garland, the star's boony Ted III. Judy Garland, O'ay, had three for a star as board. Oh, my God. Woo! What a bunch of punks. Dorothy Damage, Carmen Jones had two. Don't keep looking for Mr. Good Bar, pair, and Good Birdman, Joe and Mark II. And one of Pays for Jane Fonda, Include? Joan Fontaine, Rebecca had one and Good Birdman on a Stays your one. She had one and Black, Mildered Pierce won for people over the age of 100. And finally Olivia had to have one and stake a snake pit had won because people said it was the pits. How about Brad, he haven't he? Lots. Yeah, let's do that one for the male actors again. See if Brad can get about seven. What do you say? What's in the box? Seriously, I'll watch that in term movie just to see that scene. Oh, I have done it. I mean, Morgan Freeman was great in that movie, but he's a sensation-lactor. Right. Brad, I mean, Brad is like, I'm trying to think of a movie that he was really good in. California. I didn't see that. California with a K. If you hadn't told me that it was him, I never would have guessed. Oh, maybe that's why it was good. Because he really stopped and think about that. He was in that fight club, which was just a stupid pointless violent gratuitous piece of crap. God, thanks. And what else was he? He was in that movie, the river. What the, oh no, he wasn't a good movie where he played the brother. Mm-hmm. The two fishermen, the Montana movie. Yeah, that was a good movie. A river with Greg Sheffer. But that was when Greg Sheffer had like, look, black and blue eyes. Oh, you're psyching again. I just watched that again over the weekend. Did you really get it? That was a very sad movie though. Yeah, what? I did Brad have to be the one who died. 9.27 at 5.60. Don't see the year again. But that factory Neil. Right. That's right. That's me. Mr. Faggot, I'm proud of it. And we saw Tom Walling's last night. He was flaming. I wonder if Mo watched that show. He's probably a closet smallville fan. You know, probably got a thing for Lana. I got to think for Lana. Yeah. Yeah, she's all right. Right here. She said for she, what she said? You called that a penis. Let me tell you right now, are you fat people out there? You want to lose weight balance for life?

We're supposed to be in five seats. You, A-M. Those check-and-pants. Oh, right. My life took their card or their wall. He drives my view and gives these three feet spoke. I wouldn't ride with no weight. I wouldn't ride with no weight. I said I needed a lady today. So I'm just sitting on a bench and go away. Oh, waiting for the lovely bus to take me away. Oh, just sit on one of bench and go away. With my thin fine girl. Oh, my girl. The first place it's time to come and change. First the bus there's no weight, see the same. All that kind of doing, give it to us, we did do. The private holidays, you must be in the same. Just didn't give, rest in my bones. One day, why am I white for me be alone? We've built it over and I never win. I just lined up, stepping through the morning again. Oh, you so I just hung up and you go away. Waiting for the lovely bus to take me away. Oh, oh, hey, you took me sitting on a bench and go away. With my thin fine girl. There it is. It's about time at the free meal. There you go. There you go. Take off those checkered pants. 1933 at 5.60 WM. Ever to checkered pants are partly official uniform in Delray and Boca when you think you'd think Plast probably by the only reason. Moe wears those, he realizes how silly he looks, but you know when you live in Boca you're supposed to wear either line green or checkered pants. And what's the other one? Lemon yellow, canary yellow. Oh, yeah, with it with a blue shoes. That's really cool. Oh, man. A nice mustard yellow to talk about a fashion plate. Anyway, speaking of that, the hour by hour numbers came in from the award rating book and I just thought we'd mentioned it against where you put ourselves on a back eye. And, missed. I don't get to hear that much of Moe show. We're number one. Demi. So he may have actually been on your thinking this morning for helping goose up his six to ten morning drive slot, which is why they moved his show from ten to two, which were belongs back to nine to one to try to goose up a desperate morning show. And we did it. We gooseed him up by six to ten to a point. He would have had a four point one in men and steady had a four point seven, six to ten. Because his three hours two of them were horrendous and mom was very good. I don't understand that. So I guess what it means is they can only take him in small doses. Oh, seriously? Because five to six did. Dirty boys had a three point seven, sure, and men. And then six o'clock, Moe comes on and goes from a three point seven out of a three point three. He drops almost half a point. When they hear his voice. Then seven o'clock all of a sudden in that hour and they go up to a five point four. Which is a stellar hour and ice going air moe. But the eight o'clock, then they drop back down to a three point four. A three point four for Moe. Nine o'clock we come on with a six point four, which is like his six o'clock and eight o'clock hours put together. Almost. See they got a six point seven of those two hours put together. We got a six point four just in the nine o'clock hour. At tech clock we go to a nine point five, eleven o'clock and nine point two, and at noon a seven point three. I'm sure we get a little bit of a little damage from the, Lardass monster in noon hour from Lardass. Oh, I'm confident we probably still beat him, but I sure be interested in seeing those hour by hours for IOD and big and semi of the stations. Do I day fry fry fry day fry day I was just told the kid out in here. Who told you that, tough? What are you talking to Maddie Bell? We'll have him by noon, okay? Don't give me this Friday stuff. That's muff again. See he's too busy consort of clearance was on a full with John Weiner right now. Oh, they're on to us. You know, who you kid and clearance? What a disgrace, you know, and let's see today's only the, it's the 30. It's already many days away from payday. So I don't have to worry about pissing parents off too close to payday. But seriously, that's bad when your program director is bunk butt buddies with the guy that's been a morning show on another station and feeding him all kinds of information and phone numbers and contacts and try to goose up. Show if I'm low, I'm on a way back for the station right now. Well, that would be like a host of one show being a guest on a competitive. When you leave him alone, I see that you're picking on that silly old man on. I'm just talking about how he thanked me profusely. Didn't he? Did I miss that beer? Or we all missed it. Are we on this? That's okay, Mo. That's what you get because payback is a bitch. Is that what somebody once said payback is a bitch? No one got a 7.3 we got four stellar hours on there, which we thank the audience profusely. Am I patent myself on a back? Yes, why not? Nobody also do it. I mean, uh, Clarence, I mean not clear. In fact, Clarence, did he come in here and say nice job? No. No, that's what it about 20 times. But he's kind of a subtle anyway but the numbers came out? Hey, did not? To me? Oh, not to you. To me? You fat fag he never said that. Well, that's what he's thinking. Wanna clock we're going out of a five point. What happened to the mad dog? I mean he took good hours but not his usual stellar hours. And I'm thinking at January for more remarks. Probably people with an IQ larger than their thumbnail had other things that are mind-be-side sports. Wouldn't you think? No, come on. Which probably is why I did so well and why we did so well. Cause we were the only show on a radio station talking about what was really happening in the world whether you agree or like what we were saying or not. That's another story. But we were the only ones doing it as opposed to a bunch of stupid sports stuff. Which let's face it, January for boring march. You got the panthers and a heat. Does anybody care about them? No. Did they go to the play-on? No. You need to want to have a good season. No. There you go. I rest my case. Now of course that the draft has passed last Saturday. No. We got some heavy duty full ball. Give me the ball. And I still say that's a disgrace this morning. I didn't hear anybody calling in challenge. Although I did hear a couple of guys that were pissed off about those comments. And it were right. About guys socializing from different teams and congratulators. What's wrong with that? What is wrong with that? Huh? They're out of the along. And I give you a classic example. Every time like the major anniversary, I remember on this last March one, Ricky Tickey called in Rick Shaw, we never, ever. In fact, I've never officially met Rick Shaw. I used to see him with it often games like I told him we'd wave at each other. He'd be a few rows down below me. I never officially met him. You never shook the guy's hand. But he was had classy enough to call me up and say, great goal and congratulations to the hell and you do great radio. Whatever you said, it left a, it left a not in my throat. Let the lump in it was either that or the moths of all from that belly. But this preceded that. Remember that? So what's not to like, so we work on different stations. That I mean we can't congratulate each other when we, like Rick Shaw had his 40th anniversary and he did not comment on that. Yep. Yes. It's not a war. It's not the end of the world. It's not WWE 4. Like we're in right now, according to James Wolsey wants to pull the Wolsey over your eyes. No. Just a goddamn game. And I'm so sick and terribly sports nerds, especially the ones that work around us on Q and the ones that were surrounded by who take all of this soul life and death so serious. You know, it's like these numbers we got. You know, it's a luck of the draw. If your people get diaries yet and they like you, you luck out. Okay. We, not gun wood. I'm not gun on it right now. We've done good 25 years running. How we done so good? We must have had a lot of trained monkeys out there, Moha. Not a trained monkey is long before you came to town. All this crap about what all we talked about is me. What would he do? I don't know somehow for 20 years. A long excruciating years I survived if I've even knew who to help you were, except the course with that tape, which I recommended him for the dolphin job. Which he'll never make any comment about that. Recommended him when Bob Green gave me that box of tapes. You knew that. But he was doing money in his football before Westwood 1 said, by the way, don't come back because you're a piece of crap. You know, talent? Yes. Great voice. Yes. That's the story. The other thing I heard, which I'm sure Beiner Boy also heard, was that self-aggrandizing thing. It's one thing to raise money for charity. It's another thing we go on. Odd in finitum and patch yourself all over the back of a, you know, you know, you don't want to talk about that? That was at a break as hard. Oh my god. We're going to have to ring our chiropractor in there. This guy's twisted like a pretzel now. Back to bringing a whole staff of chiropractor is to put it back together after patent himself with both arms and his leg. And then the young guy was patent him on the ass. I kind of like the, my guess that's a sports thing. Right. But that was just one thing to raise it nice gone. We appreciate that. And then I guess he, I didn't hear it, but he must have made a comment yesterday morning or Monday or one of the colors did about me and how he's raising so much money for charity. What the arrogors ever done. Uh, you know, it speaks for itself. Yeah. And somebody did call him later and straighten him out about Camille's house. I did mention center one of the other ones too. But we've raised plenty of money for charity on the show. I just don't feel like spending a lot of time patting myself on the back. I'd rather pat myself on the back of the great book we just had since so that's a little more important to us right now. Yeah. In addition to which, you know, the audience cares about the arbitron ratings because we made an important to them. Over the years when we took that poll last week, that's one of the things that they do on here about. And we'd like here about the hour by hour. The other stations too if Maddie Bell would get on that because Duff says Friday, that's unacceptable. Okay. It's an unacceptable answer to that question, though. I don't want to pick on you because then you're under lot of stress. Duff, good off this, in strike. Get off your ass and get all this fucking great. Yeah. Oh, man. Just given him like a little tiny job and he still can't handle it. That's what Karen stole me. That's why I could. Well, never mind. 1941. Now, let me ask you, speaking of that is the the lump gone from being a voice throat. No, probably still some markings there.

All right, all right, okay, okay. 1947 at five, 60, WQM, this is a good poll question that Jack and West in points out. Yeah, first he says, did you ever get the second page to the facts about unusual activity in the stock market before 9, 11 when you posted on your website? No, I did not get the second page, which pisses me off, because I'm in the middle of reading a really riveting thing, some really important information, and I realized that the first page didn't match the second one I was reading, and the reason being that the middle page was left out. And they never facts this the other page. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, we appreciate when people facts this good stuff, but come on, you know, two out of three and cut and cut it. Anyway, Jack says PSM in a lawyer, listeners since 86, but I've never called, thought it would make a good poll question, I didn't understand what he meant in the beginning, and then I thought about that, and I said, yeah, that's right. Have you ever called the show? And then, of course, we can never have different categories. I think we'll do that tomorrow. Don't let me forget. Don't forget. Okay, I'll write it down. So, the player's came into taking congratulations to you, but I told him that he would have to say it on the air, get on Mike and go on the air with it. Any ran out because you wouldn't believe me. No, no, he ran out because he knows that I'm going to talk about how he's in bed with the John penis, a weiner. John penis was a different guy. He was a sales guy. John penis was a good sales guy. I should point out. He's gone. Just like Julio was a great engineer. He's gone. That, that, well, you already told me that was going to happen. Yeah. I mean, you put two and two together and got 69 as usual. But it's as very sad. He gets squeezed out and they didn't have the, they didn't have the decency to do it the right way. They squeezed him out. Well, we can't afford the, you know, the budget's really tight. The economy sucks and advertising's down a little bit. So what about if you work for $40 a week, huh? And he said, no, and then said, well, how about 70? They said, that was the end. Good luck to you Julio. You're a good guy. I like you a lot. He had a good time up here. Finally, the alley. Oh, it's bigger Toronto. It's sunny and good. It's 50 right now. I'm going to be 61 today. And we're off the list. Which I'm sure you saw was, it was too bad because it happened right after we got off the air when I clock yesterday. I saw it. Did you see it? Yeah. And it was great. Well, wherever the list is, we're off it. No more travel advisory from the WH. Oh, I'm sure that the Toronto officials were over there in Geneva with bagfills of money. I mean, a lot of us scientific evidence. There's no problem here. Of course last night, the blue jays, which is kind of unfortunate because the owner of the blue jays, the guy from Rogers, cable, put up tickets for a buck of peace to try to fill a place up and sold out allegedly almost 50,000, which the skydome holds about 50,000 plus little more. And they announced the attendance is 48,000. But unfortunately, it's like a Marlins attendance announcement because there was no 50,000 people there. About 30,000 would be about right. But nonetheless, there was a lot of people there because they didn't really care about the boggie. And they wanted to show a little solidarity because this is a community where people really do care about their city. I know that's a real novelty in South Florida. But the people here have a sense of civic pride. They were pissed off and fired up about the WH. Oh, no way. They screwed us to the tune of about $2 billion this time.

It's a beautiful day too by the camp here to join it, but you can you know I'll get to the air can of this probably having some special deals and you can probably come here for us on Stay at the hotel for practically nothing Go out and get some good street meat Hmm, I'm telling you they got a tight and sausage with fried onions here that is so good. It's just enough to make you scream it. Oh fried onions I mentioned this yesterday, but I'm just looking to Palm Beach post I couldn't find anything in here either is so sad So sad about a bunch of horseball newspapers you haven't South Florida Jerry Williams who was one of the originators. He was my idol as a child about a hundred years ago The end of talk radio and Boston dead at 79. I why would that be in a South Florida newspaper? Number one it should be in a Palm Beach post because Jerry had a home in Palm Beach for many many years Number two he was on WNWS back in 1980 which is hardly a hundred years ago in the heyday That was the greatest year of that station's history. We had a rating book One of the books that you know I was so gigantic it was just humongous. It was huge huge And he's dead at 79 Could I find anything in a hurdle about Jerry Williams dying anything in a Sun Sentinel Tom's a cab a little piece on it. No Well, I mean, what what what are we talking about here seriously? What the hell are we talking about and you wonder why the public is so ill informed If you ask me this radio station is about the only place in South Florida you'll find anything that's going on in the world That you really want to hear about you know Seriously, I'm not talking about network news and my that's not South Florida anybody can get that anywhere But I'm just talking about in the South Florida area You know you get a couple lost puppies on the news in a couple of you know Illegal aliens that are washing up on sure the same old-timer direct and The stories too Oh, this is good a tourist place to avoid in Florida. Somebody says a Marlon's game. I like that Marlon's game excellent and obviously a lot of people taking their advice Marlon's game. Okay, we can put that pull up anytime you want to Rick I don't want to start getting pushy because you've been doing a magnificent job of restraining yourself the last couple of weeks He picked a mask You called an asked if what I'm gonna be told or not what are you talking that we would let him know Well, I just let him know very go. You must be psychic powers working again What Florida tourist destination would you tell you about a state friends to avoid? We got so far Disney World Bush Gardens, Dogestone Crabs, Rascal House Key West the Southwest Mules Mall and a Marlon's game and I'm waiting to hear go the phones again. There we go Now this is a top one. What am I gonna vote for? I wonder My choice is clear and well, well, I'm let's see yeah, you'll see I'm gonna say the Southwest Mills Mall because I live I'll die day number one and number two For the life of me I can't imagine why anybody I mean oh, yeah Joe Stonecratt is George voters for But why would anybody go to the Southwest Mills? Well, there's nothing there. There's no anchor store Like big the main team Huh, it's a mall Well, when you go out of town to On the they they you go to a mall. No, I mean, I take that back in Amsterdam for example. There's a mall I'm trying to think what hell an invite is At least they have a big one of the big chain record stores in there. I mean it didn't name me the big chain record store Virgin's okay. It was the only version in town and it was the record store But they're out of business but anyway there there's a big shopping mall there that used to be some kind of a big Palacir something and that's a neat place to go see. Yeah, but I mean I wouldn't consider it as a tourist destination Now I will say this like in Vegas Caesar's and the NGM just to name a couple have these huge malls within the hotel That's just a part of Oh, yeah, but there's a great the the big shopping mall in Vegas though is so what does the name of that to the fashion Something mall now you probably never winner because you weren't there enough Long enough right that is one sensational mall They don't just have your ordinary pedestrians stores. They have like these old collectible store There's one of them and I just some read nifty stores and they're the fashion something mall and Vegas Right, that's one of the places you would go but the song rest mills mall. There's there's nothing to attract you there I mean they had a couple of food courts and they got Only one thing they got there that you would go to see We sides a bunch of people who can't speak English. You don't even go there. I see that Huh, I'm done. I don't I just don't get it WDQ I am Yeah, I like to add something on those with go ahead The flop shop Okay, okay, that's the end of that and when I still need pressed in the swap shop Huh, that's one of our fine sponsors in the past But he's entitled. He's in town Elizabeth opinion I mean if I was a tourist come to town less I was a French Canadian. I'm not so sure I'd go and smell the elephant does but it's a nifty plate Huh It's a nifty place for the people living town or know where the bargains are at the swap shop But there you go see that guy's probably from a church channel. You've had out of town friends come to town. I take it Yes, now would you tell them to go to the swap shop for the snow crystals? What anybody tell them? No? Okay, I wouldn't tell them to go to the braored model when time ago to date land. I wouldn't tell me really Any mall go to the strip shopping center room as a matter of fact, you know, I was in the Eden Center the other day here on the weekend Don't say the seers center. I think I said source center And that there's no mall in South Florida like that. It's like three floors three stories Or four maybe I'm already sure it's huge gigantic There's not a mall in South Florida anything like that not even close and they have a Laura secret in there too Don't ask okay KWM Are you here then?

Because that's fine, but, you know, especially the part where he talks about the mustard and old Jews or something. Get that one old bitch up, sir. But, that's the wrong guy. I think he's got to mix up with... I should have both bought one at $1.30. Shon! I don't think any of these match. It's kind of like mixed in match.

I guess this fact you didn't hear about when Laura Bush was speaking at Gainesville and said... Can't beat that gator meat. Just hear about that. Five, six, seven, seven. Sarah Sergio says, how about Kai Ocho? I think that's a little advantage. Right. That's an early on museum. Well, when we build the early on museum, I think that would... In fact, can you imagine?

satin test pattern operation medium an apoli freedom rights Nancy snow mislisa statement to the FCC public forum on media consolidation washman dc is the in the liberating uh people and other companies habit these days mister cops we the people of the united states could use more than our own fair share of liberation for our media oligopoly about a month from today junse second the FCC's expected to substantially relax the regular theory cap on how many tv stations in a single company may own right now rules bar america broadcasts from morning tv stations reaching more than thirty five percent of homes they are likely to be raised to forty five percent coverage further it's very likely that rules will be lifted the limit the ability of broadcasts by second tv stations in their markets or bar cities news paper and broadcast station for merging while the FCC has been holding a few window dressing public forms across the country the real decision making regarding the new FCC rules being made between the few existing media companies and a government agency with a pointed official's the FCC will do what is politically expedient while the public interest will continue to be talked about in newspaper tutorials and college textbooks how do I know this because of what happened with the talk communications act of 1996 when the public was completely out of the discussion Ryan loury meteorite or the L.A. times stated that the new FCC rule changes affecting consolidation ownership of the media is tremendously under reported perhaps the most under reported news to be of our time in fact the consolidation story is being reported but not on the front pages of our newspapers it's in a business in finance and newspapers and broadcast industry publications the only those in the know and industry and side is followed a subject we the people have become water lip mans be wilted heard and are forced to function like the angry mob at the gates or the proverbial peanut gallery occasionally whining that nothing is on the watch but we know not where to turn for help so we just keep watching and by the way no one in this room is bothered would rest the addictive qualities of television jerry mandir wrote about the insidiousness of TV over 20 years ago in four arguments for the elimination of television it's truly ironic that as we sit here today discussing american press ownership the US governments re broadcasting dan rather tom brocon Peter Jennings and Iraqi TV to show the Iraqi people what a free press looks like in a democracy before we teach others about democracy we might try practicing it here at home media power is political power and one of the public is being left out of this major decision that effects all of our lives we've been asked to sit on the sidelines keep shopping follow the NBA playoffs or watch must see TV while the corporate mega media reported friends and government cozy up and bring us anything but the democratic landscape of information and news we can use if democracy is about vigorous and antagonistic debate full of a wide spectrum of voices and opinions were hardly there brothers and sisters in Iraq we have less than a handful of media who bring us all our news and those new sources that bring us the news are increasingly dependent on their close ties to official Washington and other corporate sources of news our 24 hour news cycle requires constant feeding which advertising and publicity peep pack and sources of news are only too happy to nourish and the federal government the largest public relations division is inside the Pentagon where government public relations specialists provide Monday through Friday feeds to the national media invented reporters didn't just accompany the military to the Middle East but they also sit regularly for pre-arranged briefings from Donald rum spelled Tory Clark and every fly shirt and a corporate media environment today the best journalist is increasingly the doodiful journalist to understand that symbiotic relationship between official channel information sources and the news story product long gone are the days of independent journalists like George Selvez who would have gladly been kicked out of his first Washington press briefing and exchanged for the neighborhood goings on back home just last week a little truth emerged from the fog of war MSNBC journalist Ashley Banfield told a gathering of students of Kansas State University that the American people didn't see what happened after mortars landed in Iraq only the puffs of smoke there were horrors complete left out of the war coverage in the U.S. what we did see was at what advertising converging media and official sources of news wanted to see a nonstop flow of images by cable news operators who wrapped themselves in the American flag and go after a certain target demographic it was she said a grand and glorious picture that had a lot of people watching a lot of advertisers excited about cable TV news but it was not journalism Nancy says I teach in ecology communications where journalism concentrations are all but dead while advertising and public relations concentrations are thriving why because students are why to the fact that the news businesses where the jobs are not creating the next mural or crunkite they know that broadcasting used to have a clear mandate for public service has been lost in the fog of consolidation try telling some of the American people are the real landlords of the broadcast airways and that broadcasts are enjoying rent control person see what kind of looks you'll get we all know the truth of what's really going on here when president Bush assured the Iraqi people that Iraq's oil fields were properly owned by the Iraqi people I couldn't help but think about that other hot rhetoric we hear so often that the American public on the airways were sick of empty promises everyone in this room needs to carry around the following statements and organizing principle the airways did not belong to the broadcasters did not belong to the advertisers the owners of the broadcast their waves via law are the people of the United States never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change this dynamic we will and it's the best adverse know we can have to Iraq Afghanistan ray place else about what a truly free and liberated people's media looks like Nancy snow professor of the author of Propagandaian Information War and professor communications in journalism at California state right on target

But the reason I was coming was watching Bill Marlison. Yeah sir. You know I've all grabbed there and said, and it's show. One thing that I've stuck out that you said that. You know, it's a wonderful for the time of crisis. Everybody's coming attack us because of the craziness this guy is doing. You know, it's Joe Bush guy. Joe Bush. Yeah, but you know, those one black kid on there was you saying the same thing. You know, you said a few times that you know that you know, that you know, they're trying to impose all the right wing stuff on everybody. The rest of the world doesn't do what they do and they're wrong and all that. Also against them, baby, the good guys in the bad guys. It's the Cowboys Indians all over again said, Wild West. GW Bush, my tell to give me that 10 gallon of hat and my six shooter and let's go out. Take over the world. Either whiz our guest is. Yeah, this thing that they're doing is business of well, what kind of pressure can we bring? How can we penalize those people that go along with them? Whoever heard a such a thing, it's kind of like learning with them. It's kind of like what I was just talking about with the media. We're all supposed to have the same opinion as them. And if we don't, then we're the enemy. We're all supposed to have the same opinion as Limbaugh and O'Reilly and all these other white wing assholes and Sean Hannity. And if we don't, then we're the bad guys. Whoever heard a such crap. And this is what we're exporting to Iraq or any place else in a world. This is the idea of democracy that we want to export. Like that column I read before. I said, the minor we start doing it home first before we try exporting it. Let's get a right at home. Operation American Freedom. That's when I want to start seeing. Oh, and speak of that. I don't want the whole hour to slip away without just mentioning. You don't want to read it. City Council because more and more of these cities are vote none of this. I want to talk about the idea of a vote to consider joining opposition to federal Patriot Act. This is in the Arizona Daily Star about Tucson, Arizona. This says Tucson could be the latest city of question the USA Patriot Act passed by Congress in 2001 that expands the ability of law enforcement to track and trap terrorists. The Council voted Monday 4 to 3 along a party line split Republican Mayor Bob Walkup and Council members Kathleen Dunbar and Fred Ronstead opposed to decide in May whether to join some 83 other cities across the country and expressing concerns of where the desilicate terrorist has overwritten civil liberties which it causes. I'd like that. Council member Steve Lee, a Democrat who brought the issue to colleagues at the prompting a blue coalition of civil libertarians in Tucson said the great irony of the act is that in trying to strengthen the country the roads core values. The Patriot Act may create a systematic systematic climate of fear by dividing Americans, Lee, all set among the concerns he cited, the act allows wiretamps without probable cause and allows monitoring of religious organizations whether there's any indication of criminal activity or not. It's kind of that business about we think you're going to do something illegal and don't mess with us. We'll listen in and we'll watch in and we'll check with Jane Audie and I and we'll do whatever it'll help we want. Sounds like fascism to me. I could be wrong on that. It sounds like a lot like creeping fascism. What are what Tony Blair thinks about that? 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line covenants past 11 a QAM.

A fugitive priest on Tuesday after he was accused of leading a corruption ring at a local customs office that cost a country 10 million bucks. The Reverend Carlos Fores was named head of Keto's customs office as part of an anti-corruption-draven 2000. Due to his honest reputation and political connections. As been missing since last week when police sought to detain him for his alleged role in the corruption ring. And it goes on with all the glory details. A Belgian lawyer is planning to press an end with a war crimes lawsuit against US General Tommy Franks despite American anger. The suit brought by 19 Iraqis accused of general Franks of war crimes during the Iraqi conflict. Lair Jan Furman, who is acting on behalf of the Iraqis, described the plaintiff's victims of cluster bombs that have US attacks on ambulances and civilians. We have a very specific case with specific evidence Mr. Furman said. I don't see how they can reject it. The case would be presented in court on May 13 including evidence which have been gathered by Belgian doctors working in Baghdad. Mr. Furman said there were 17 specific incidents in which US soldiers and commanders had violated the law. So that's got to be a mistake, I'm sure. I think we just had bad aim like that Chinese embassy. We bomb that time. We just have been in the same friendly fire. A fairly friendly fire. Hostile fire, etc. All of these things. Which floor to tourist destination? Would you tell your friends out of state friends to avoid? That's our poll question at anyorarges.com. We've gotten down there 300 votes to 91. Feet of boys impressed by that. Always not impressed by the fact they say little Havana. 706. See we could have put Kai Ocho but that's such a short term thing, you know. As opposed to like little Havana in general, what time is sure is considered to be a tourist destination right? I guess. For people no speaking in English people want to see Meris greasy asses house. Want to see this a 10 year old kid that 19 year old kid she married? Little Havana study. How old was he 19? Well let's take a look at him. What's he way does look like? Maybe he's got a breakdown even better than Thomas Swelling last night on saw grass. I mean on the, that's not real. It was a good show. It was a very good show. But all I do, you know, I have to wonder how come there's so much crypto night floating around? I know they had that meteor shower scads. Are we going to get to see Tom early take a meteor shower? I'd be impressed with that because we should see much last night. It's quite a worthless hypervadilating. Some really desperate queens. I mean desperate people out there. I'm going to get to see Tom early ask. You know like that. I mean anybody get excited about what they showed their last night has really really got a serious problem. This really needs to get that search party and find a life. Find something alive to touch. That's not connected already. Little Havana 76. Sograx mills mall 50. Joe Stonecrab 34 of her respectable third place. Overpriced overrated. I never been there but everybody tells me that you know everybody. Yeah. Because I don't like Stonecrab. So I would I go there. Right. Well they have other food as well. I understand that. But I don't, I'm not going to Schmer anybody to go and get in. I'm not interested in one of those plastic places where you have to know the may-to-dee. I'm just not there that whole scene. They treat people like cattle. Or you mean like the Rascal House, which is a little ways down the list. Joe Stonecrab 34. Have you been there? Joe's? Yeah. Twice. And they treated you like cattle? Crap. Well who did it mean nice? But that's only because the guy that I was with and that I'm like Schmering the guy hundred bucks. Right. There you go. When and that's Schmeramau. That's the way you do it. I'll see Swampcrab 23, Disney World 21, Rascal House 21, Tywood Disney World. I'll tell you one thing. I'd sure rather go to the Disney World again. I've been there many times in the Rascal House. I wouldn't go to the Rascal House if they paid me fifty bucks per bite. You know? Would you, would you go eat there? I'd never been there. You have never been to the Rascal House? No way. Okay. I'm going to tell you that story again. All right. He was 19. Marlon's game 18. My Ky 11. Basside 7. See aquarium 7. Lycupter Safari 4 is that's a fairy. Beach. What is it bush gardens do and the Metro Zoo 1 out of three hundred one vote? Places to tell your friends are coming from out of state. Stay in a hallway. Now. So I'm working at 8am and I'd at WI and Z many years ago. All right. All right. And it midnight very frequently. My producer and I whoever my producer have it to be at that time. We go eat. I'd even tell you a news about the day to midnight. See this is one of the reasons that I'm fat besides being a fat slump. But you don't need to midnight. Not a good idea. But I've even working. I mean like, yeah, like now I work nine to one when I get done with work. What a clock I go eat. So many many times we go to lums or somewhere like air wags. I loved Wabbed. I don't care what anybody says. Wags wasn't gourmet, but it was open twenty four hours. And the food was like several levels up from Denny's. I was just fine. So anyway, I had been doing my halendale thing and a thing with the old Jews doing on my case in sunny Rosemar and talking about the rascal house and about the old rascal stuff and the pickles and the stuff in their bag and stealing the silverware. And so I was challenged. I was invited to go eat at the rascal house after work. This one I had been done. Okay. All right. This is Lionsie. So about there in the Carroll city. Get on a Hershey highway to rev up there to North Miami Beach and go over to the rascal house. I was at 183rd in the Collins. Okay. Something like that. Go to the rascal house. It's about 12 30 tomorrow. It's still fairly active in there. In fact, this is one of two stories. The last time I ate there, which was after the sabbally, they shoved me in the here's a guy with like a t-shirt and tattoos sitting next to me. He was sitting close enough to me that he could have, if he would have had sars, I'd have been in big trouble. If he would have had like herpes, I could have caught a just by him breathing on me. But anyway, so this other time we go in there. Here's a table right next to us and it was about half of us in Collins kids. Well dressed, nice looking couple of girls, two or three guys, whatever. And they're well dressed. They obviously were coming from some kind of a party or some kind of a, you know, they were dressed fancy, not sloppy, no jeans, but like you know what I'm saying? Right. So the one kid is having a whatever he's having has a glass of orange juice. So the waitress comes over and she brings them the food and she puts the orange juice and then she, he accidentally knocks the orange juice over. Yeah. Now are you heard the story? The orange juice is running over the edge of the table on of this kid's nice new, freshly pressed pants, okay, white pants. And it's just, and of course it was a big glass orange juice. His look would have it. You know, like about a half a gallon. And it's rotten and she stands there. Look, I'm saying, ah, sunny, that should be your worst problem. I think it's a story like that is the reason that I had never bothered to go there. And you know, something that's probably one of the better stories. Although I did eat a pumpkin, it's once. Yeah. Oh, same thing. Same deal. And it's not, and of course there used to be in my mind of chicken and the egg thing. Like it will be. Yeah. It wasn't so good. It was not a good idea. It was not a good idea. It was not a good idea. It was not a good idea. It was not a good idea. It was not a good idea. It was not a good idea. It was not a good idea. Like it will be. It wasn't so much where the help like this in the beginning or the waiting on the client tell over the years make them like that. And in my mind, now there is no doubt right. That in the beginning, they may have all been very nice people, very considerate the people work in these restaurants. But after putting up with that clientele for a certain period of time, they just became inserable, hateful, uh, psychotic lunatics. I really enjoyed the rat maze that they make you go through before you leave to make sure that you can't sneak out. Well, it takes you right in front of the cash register. Right. You know, with the turn style and everything. Uh-huh. 560, 5060, pound 560 on the 18 to and yet when I say that to certain people, they become outrage. They're just indignant that there's anybody who's not in love obsessed with the Rascal house. So this is the place you must eat in South Florida. And I have one reply, one very short three letter reply to them. Fair. I just did the food but to the entire experience. You must miss the Rascal house experience. WQAM. No, I'm out on that list. Those are the day crews as we got you those rip offs to take out the middle and nowhere to see the money. Yeah, well, some of you mentioned the jungle queen. No, I mean, I don't know. I'm just sponsors years. I don't want to say the name. Why not? We got where at the small shop on here. The crew's in the one that they grew. See you. See you. She's a sh**. Oh, okay. Every time they sing that jingle that shitboard is in the sound too good, you know. Okay. I'm not really sure what that word was. What? Now, the network what I just did. I don't know. How are we supposed to know? I think you pardon? 560, 5060, pound 560. Well, if that time check, I'm sure we'll have this snow one way or that. That's really assuring. How we supposed to know? Well, great. WDQIM. I like to have a name for the list. Yeah, go ahead. How about Dave County? That's actually a great good choice. Perfect. That's the best way to hold it. Yeah. Who's that? Who you think it is? George? Yeah. George is small potatoes. You want to talk to George? Hey, listen. I got something you can help me with. Yeah, but. I'm not going to use you. What's there is on the name? About 1992. There was an article that came out on a man's magazine, like a maximum. We didn't exist back then. But it was 500 reasons why not to vote for George Bush. Yeah. I can't find it anywhere. What does that have to do with how old I am? Oh, not the boat is that you were a little older. You might have remembered it. Like George is like 25 or 10 years ago. He's 15. George is 25. Yeah, I'm 22. Okay, so he's going to run around the other day. I don't know. You're 12. Why are you so good? I'm trying to find this. This thing don't work. Oh, no. No, I just, I'm trying desperately to get the cutting off. Don't work. He's off. He's off now. I'm going to just try. Let me try one. It's not something that I lied to apparently. Now, this is the same working. See, and it went on. How about I just, I just, I do it. Do you want to? This is QAM, yes sir. This is not going to work, sir. Why not? You see? Oh, it did work. He got rid of my- This is the lag. We're, we're hot, huh? It's a lag. No, no, it's not a lag. We're having some spastic problems here today, which is very enjoyable. We're having a good time on it. Right. I'm sure it's the thunderstorm. Is that what it is? I'm just making up excuse. You sure got a spastic phone situation. I'll tell you that. You got Dave County on there, beiner boy. We got it. Dave County. In fact, not just for people from out of state, but people in state. Yeah, avoid Dave County like the place for locals to. Yeah, avoid Dave County. Of course, the good news is the Rascal House is in Dave County and so is Joe Stonecrab. So you can kill three birds with long stone there. You can vote all three of them. And then, of course, line country safari. Now, where is that? Up north-ish. I forget exactly which county in Broward? No, for the. On Palmbeat and one of those. Yeah. Well, Metro Zoo, that's in Dave County. The monkey junk a Leo. We didn't put the perichong along here. Did we? And for good reason. I like the perichong. And it's going to be new and improved. No, but again. Don't be knocking in. 26 past 11 has 5 60 W. W. M on a really spastic Wednesday. Just the way we like it. We're cue him. The more spastic to better. Little Havana 91. Sogressville's mall 57. Joe's 42. Little Havana's pulling away. Just the way we like it. And of course, the Lavan. There's some more overlap with Dave County, right?

They are not even in a day. They're not even close to back then. They have not gotten closer than 100 miles to back. Oh, holy shit. Whatever to the lights. Probably just someone with a gas grill. It didn't fucking upright us up. Something to worry about. Nothing to worry about. Back then is same. We are the army of the great Sadams who say, Araki, we protect you. The war party. That's not so far. That you hear that is firecrackers. I think we celebrate Chinese New Year. Crazy Chinese people here and back then. Not to worry. You are safe. I know that the large vehicles are badly fired. We're just going to fire behind me. They look like America takes. They're really ice cream truck. You're so rich. Getting out of the oven. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. You're not there, you're not. You're not there. You're not there. You're not there. I'm not there. 1,32,5,60, TV job offer for former Iraqi Information Minister. Did you see this? Yes. An Arab TV news channel is offered to job to Sadams who say It's tough. Spend, Dr. former Iraqi Information Minister in my hand. Said Al Sahab. So haphabekin. Tecimi Grid on Fox News. You know what? Talk about a great spin, Mr. Sahabekin will play for his persistent refusal to admit that US troops were in Baghdad as been pulled by the Dubai-based by-based all-RB out-channel that there's a job waiting for him. We see no problem in having Mr. Sahaf to an his first of all. A Sahaf is not on list of the 55 Iraqis most widely marked by the Americans. He's not on that deck of cards. And he won international fame during the war. We would be happy to have him on our team. Ali Al-Hedithi, the head of our Abyatul AFP. During the war, there'd be Spectacle Sahaf on fans worldwide for his in-your-face defiance, as U.S. and British troops swept through the country in their crowded topple Sodom. He's dropped out of sight since U.S. forces took the Iraqi capital abruptly ending Sodom's 24-year-old rule. Even President George W. said last week, he had sent out of meetings in Washington to catch a few of Sahaf's daily press conferences. He was great Bush told NBC television. Ha ha ha ha, how do you like that? Even the Bush mice didn't sell. Couldn't help but let our little chuckle every now and then. Like that. Oh, see this is bad. No wonder we got to give Kurtz-Hannel all our radio stations. Nice Lynn. Kurtz-Hannel communications in the number one U.S. radio station owner. Today posted a lower first quarter profit. Oh, this is probably why we had to let go holio too because of the fact that these least probably we'd in the crap because of Kurtz-Hannel's losing money could imagine a beastly's. Oh, brother. Posted a lower first quarter profit is flat radio advertising in a week-live entertainment promotion business, offset the strong outdoor ad business of cheap channel. While Kurtz-Hannel managed to report flat radio revenues against the backdrop of the Warner rackets promotion business was stunned by weaker concert ticket sales but no blockbuster tours to match last year's cross-be Swill Nation young and Billy Joel Noughton John concerts. Which Billy Joel am in the, uh, uh, Elton John, you know, is that the canceled their Toronto concert? Yeah. Essels. There's absolutely nothing going on here and I'm going to say it again, a rod and pay rod and Elton and Billy Joel and all you other pussy's out there shame on you. I stick in the dagger sticking a focus. Is that what the information minister just said something like? Yeah. San Antonio Texas based Cleared Channel reported net income of $71 million who 12 cents a share compared with a year ago profit of 90s point 3 million or 15 cents a share excluding one-time gains the company posted a year ago profit of 12 cents a share. And on and on it goes about the Cleared Channel in a rival infinity which is owned by Viacom posted a 2% decline in revenue one of the weaker performing units of the Viacom family in February. Clear channel warned that war jitters that already begun to curb add sales and forecast first quarter, uh, EBITDA. If you host a use that on CBC, I don't have any idea what that means EBITDA. Nope. It's like a new term they made up for earnings before they put in the funny figures. You want to go to your lab to that. But that's that's hold or fundraiser for cheap channel. What do you say, huh? Let's raise some money for PD Bullger and all those poor bastards over to achieve channel. We can have a telephone and come to second a June when they own every guy damn radio station and TV station and gas station in America and every newspaper and every billboard and every place else that they can spew their right wing propaganda on behalf of the very people who are empowering for do these things. Then they can watch those profits go up. Yeah. Because once you don't have any competition anymore, it's kind of hard to lose money. 560505060, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon line. How do you do you do that? Nobody there. See now that it's working out, they don't want to talk. How do you do you do I am? How are you doing? Good. Can I get on with you? You're on right now. Oh, okay. How are you doing? Topicals races on the other day just goes to show the level of intelligence on the morning show. It has nothing to do with sports. The topic of was races on our morning show on Mo show? Yeah. Topicals races on. I just merely had the comment where I said that the unfortunate part of modern day society is that if you were to really analyze it, the most races of people are the Afro-American store does. Yeah. He didn't seem to understand that and he called me. Why are you telling me this, don't I? In other words, you're making the same call to me that you made him. Are we talking about races on the show? No, no, no, no. I just, I had a vent because I was so frustrated with this man. The way he is dear, even the way he thinks. I just wanted a vent and this guy said, go to the lollies. No, no. See, that was worth it. Well, there you go. Well, he seems to keep coming back to that topic over and over and seems like he's obsessed with it the moment, you know. Oh, my God. Dave Barry about the, oh, it's not going where you think it is. Okay. A friend of mine recently gave me a Dave Barry book to retell me it was hilarious. The book's topic is on politics and Barry goes on and on about the comedy that comes from our city county state and federal politicians. He talks about how funny it is that these Cuban fascists running our county and how hilarious the alien debacle in 2000 election was. I don't think there's a goddamn thing funny about a corrupt government being run by individuals who have no respect for human and civil rights unless they've allowed to the right ethnic group and hold certain opinions. It's tragic and pathetic. I nominate Dave Barry as one of the leading assholes of the community and told my friend, Dave Barry can stick to book of his ass where it belongs. How do you like that? Something most sensible people believe about Dave Barry. He's an asshole, right? See, there's another state of mind from South Florida. Rascal house, Jo Stone crabs, the forge, Dave Barry, all a state of mind. Dave Barry's about his funny is cancer than he can't. Okay. He's about his funny is pop in a gigantic purple grape-sized hemorrhide. Here's one and you know something this is the only responsive head about your Williams pass in a way. There's something wrong. There is something very, very wrong. I realized that he was on with the NWNWS in 1980, it's 23 years ago. And most of the people listen those back in those days are probably dead by knockers. You're used to joke about our ancient demographics. He was really a very funny guy. Jerry was known. He made his career even though he was a little devious and backstabbing. But he made his career based on the real heavy duty political talk in Boston and Chicago. But when he came down here, he said it may be not in the afternoon what is on the release of the shade. People wanted mostly fun games to wanted to keep it light. And he was right. He was absolutely right. And I should in honor of his passing way. I should tell that Jerry William Stewart about the last night in town. Yeah. About the robbery it in our building. I've told you that. I will tell you that in a minute. Anyway, subject to your wife's yesterday when you mentioned the passing of your Williams, the name stirred by a memory. This is Robin Pencil van, you probably heard him on TV and he obviously did because I'm reading a head. With that I'll tell you mentioned Bill and Dolly Banks that hit home. It's been more than 20 years since Jerry left WDWDB. In Philadelphia for Florida at that time, it was my favorite talk show host is he had a firing take no gun. It's not much like yourself. That was back in the days when there was a healthy mix of left and right little conservative talk radio host. Unfortunately, both those days in Jerry Williams are now gone. Thanks for the memory says Robin Pencil van. You are as usual. That's so ridiculous. Yeah, he was great. He was a great talk show host. Took a lot of issues. The turnpike told him as it chuses. I mean, wasn't afraid to take anybody on. So anyway, his last night at WNWS, he had just had it with South Florida and went any part of the whole ambiance. And he had no further go back to Boston, I believe it was. And so I'm working eight to midnight. Now Jerry was on between two and six. I want to say it. Two and six was studdly was on there. I just love his real, the Jewish people that the right wing bitch. He was on between six and eight. So anyway, it's he's in a building. He's getting all this stuff together. He's leaving. He's got a few cartons of stuff. He's going to pack up in his car and head back to Boston. And I'm on the air. It's like about eight thirty. And all of a sudden, he comes to the door of the studio. And I'll keep in mind, this is studio with no windows. I mean, you think your close to the in like back in the corner. No exit, no only one door, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, no window. And there was a window in the door, though. And I see his face in the window would look of terror. I mean, his light as his sheet almost as pale as George. And he opens the door and he says to me, and I, the caller is gone. But I went, hello, me, all my lips there, blow you know, the old yentras going on. And so I shut off my mic and he says three black guys went guns. They took my chin and he's pointing around. Yeah. And then he disappears. Off that he vanishes. Now keep in mind that I'm sitting in a bag and of course, our building, we used to be a beauty parlor that building. And it didn't look like a radio station. It didn't have a big sign in front of it. It could have been anything. And so obviously the guys that broke in, they didn't know what kind of a business is was. They would just interested in making arm robbery. So I'm sitting there, think, and visions of sugar plums are dancing in my head. Because I got nowhere to go, baby. I got nowhere to go. I could hide out of the counter. But they can't hide too long in a room. That's about two by four. And so I, you know, and I said, if I said, we're having an emergency in a building, if someone would please call 911 and have him come to the radio station. I gave the address on the road and Dixie whatever. And to make a long story short, they, they, they've been used because I guess they finally realized that it was a radio station. They were winning their way back. And they looked and they saw the equipment and the holy crap were in a radio station. They don't money here. So I brought him in after the break. And I put him on the air and he told the whole story. He was still pale. And so this was Jerry Williams last night on the air in South Florida. That's nice. Yeah. True story. Jerry Williams dead at 79. Nothing in a Harold, nothing in a sun set on it. It's probably take a little bit too much research in the homework. In fact, I'll probably call him a Jimmy Williams. You know, just like Rick Casper. Yeah. We got such a bunch of bows. Those, there, right in crap, man. It's the perfect place, soft photo. You've heard that maggot magnet, soft Florida's a crap magnet. You can almost smell it. Look, 42 or 560 WKK, you can almost smell your pool because it's looking in small and pretty crappy these days. It's stained, dirty, cracking, maybe. Well, do something about it. Don't have no mold ugly pool, especially with all these hot days coming up that might not actually be raining. Hot summer weather is coming. You want to be dipping in that pool as much as possible.

Hang on a minute, please. Queeness! I'm so sick of that song, Riemann. You're not saying that song anymore. It's a pretty short out of the video. Happy song, Biser. It doesn't make me happy, Riemann. It makes me want a string on you. Eisner? Yes, sir. I do want to tell you one good thing you're doing. Okay. I'm so off to you for a man, Kamal. You're finally putting us on the map with that thing. Wait a go, Eisner. Well, sir, that's actually the fox network. Don't correct me, Eisner. Riemann. What are you doing, Riemann? Get any balls of play with Simba. Don't play the Simba's run on the ball, Riemann. Rex Simba didn't even have the handball. It did me land there and it's terrible. As right, they need me, Bob. Don't play a Simba again, Riemann.

And get all of us try to get me on that bachelor's shelf. But, sir, you're married, Mouth. Hey, Eisner. Yes? I don't want to marry him. I don't want to date those 25 girls. I just want to summon them. Okay. Leave it to me. I'm 48. 12 minutes till noon. We got the man dog at one. Joseph Gackie for Hank at three and then some stuff. I'd like to have one person call in who remembers Jerry Williams on that year when he was a WNWS. Or remembers him from Boston or Filly or Chicago or Nellie. Would that be nice? Okay. Well, I mean, let's have something. Let's have a little something here. God was in broadcasting for about a hundred years. He was a real pioneer and talk. I do think somebody out there would have something to say about your wins. Good night or anything. That was that. Fanfare. He just died though. You never fanfare when somebody dies. We can celebrate his life. There you go. I wouldn't get that carried away. WQAM. Yes, good morning. Yes, sir. I knew this asking people who remember Jerry Williams. This is your room. You're on right now, sir. Oh, I knew. I knew. I knew. Sorry. I got a crew up in the Boston area. And, uh, his a kid I used to listen to Jerry Williams. At that time he was on WBZ. Right. You remember he was also on WMEX once upon a time? That's right. And, uh, at that time they used to call it the 10-dimidnight ride of Jerry Williams. And then after that Larry Glich would come on. Right. With his lemonade stand. Yeah. I was always, uh, kind of addicted to radio. And then I was up in Boston about five years ago when he was on the air doing a kind of, uh, as you said, he also had a good sense of humour. Yeah. He was doing a show, uh, where, you know, was a very light. At the time he was a go, he was very against the Vietnam War. And I was just a kid on 46 now. Right. And I thought he was wrong. You know, at the time I didn't know any better. I learned later on what was really going on. But I remember, you know, in those days before they ruined radio, you could turn the dial and you had all, you know, huge, huge variety of music and different opinions that's nothing like today. So yeah, I'm sorry. And even even on the music stations back when we used to have music on A and back before FN became anything meaningful. Right. WBZ was a great station in WME Exodarney, Ginsburg. You had personalities. That's all gone now. There's no such thing. Music on FN today. There are almost no personalities. All you have is a jukebox. It's all the same and it's, uh, both mostly the same owners. But the only thing really worth listening to these days is you. I agree. Uh, so sorry to hear he's gone. I, uh, had heard he had moved down here and I was hoping he might, uh, beyond somewhere down here. Anyway, uh, I guess he was living somewhere in New England, the Thuener somewhere at the time he died. I see. Neil, uh, like I say, I grew up with the radio following a sleep at night as a kid and everything else and you're the only one left. And, uh, when you retire, that's the end of it. That point will throw our radio as a way. I think so. Thanks a lot, pal. Bye bye, Neil. See, that was something nice. See, people say you're so negative. I'm not negative. I want to say something nice about a guy who was a great broadcaster who was a pioneer and talk radio and in radio in general, he was a great, great, the broadcaster Jerry Williams and had a big pair of two by the way. He was extraordinarily ugly, which is another reason I liked Jerry. He was even ugly of the eye. Which is not easy. So, you know, let's know comment. What? What am I going to do? What am I going to do? Nothing. I'm just saying he was a very ugly. I'm that didn't make him a bad guy. I'm just saying that when you're ugly, you always really like people that are ugly. You hang out with people that are a lot ugly or anything, right? Because if you're ugly and hang out with good looking people then, you know, by comparison, it looked pretty bad. WQAM. I've never married a witch man. You know, that was the lineup too, which there was on a midnight. Oh boy. I'm getting back into the corner now. You see it? What are you going to do? Mike Winnery. Jerry, witchener. Charlie Capis. Jerry Williams. Dick Casper. Bill Colder. Bill Colder. Stan made your not pretty sure it looks like it. I got it. Sunny hurt. Oh no. Sunny hurts. You had to throw that in there and really. I didn't mean me. And here I am just barely hanging on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The time is ticking and I'm taking a look at man. Yeah. How is the old ticker anyway? It's my it's got a good squeeze. I got a good squeeze. I'm not sure what he was talking about that asshole. I talked to Bush over there. Cleveland Clinic. Another one of those rumor deals. I remember having great life. Okay. Lose my number. Just go away. Oh no. This is bad. This is terrible. Somebody named. Why did you send this to me? This is in such port taste. Somebody named Goldie Goldstein passed away. And so it's somebody who passes us the old bit here. And it says we can only hope Mo is next. That's bad. Because it wasn't our guilty. Go ahead. This is Goldie not guilty. See, I know the real name. And as far as Mo is concerned, I would dance on his grave. But other than that. That's a very, very poor taste. So that goodness we had to one guy. The new cheer wins. Maybe we'll have one or two more. What are you laughing about? Oh, just about that. About dancing on Mo's. Yeah. I really would. In fact, we could talk about raising money for charity. Can you imagine we could pay that mission to see that? Could raise millions. Oh, and a phone just went dead again. Look at this is a little line. Oh, and I just for a second. Just for a split second. You're having little problems on that end. WDQAM. Hi. Good. Pretty good. Good. That's up to you. Speaking. Oh, I see. How are you? I was listening to the night's drink erupt. And it was that incredible or what? Yeah. And when WDQAM I made notes that he was going to bring the gun in there and wait for somebody. Remember that? Yeah, I sure do. Yeah. Okay. Take care. Thanks. Here's a guy with a good memory. Those were the days, man. WDQAM. Which one of you used to bring in that? I bought a told-out store at Mid-in-Times. I'm not going to tell any old-time radio stories. I must be on a way out too. What do you think? Probably. But he used to bring in his 747. Yeah. It was a big plane. No, he used to bring in a, what the hell's the damn, the big gun? Which one? Yeah, 45. Yeah, got in there. No, wasn't a 45. A big 38 magnet. Now, now keep going. I keep going. I'm 57. I'm 35. That's what I meant. What did I say? 747. Yeah. Oh, my brains are fried. Now that I realize I'm on a way out. And anyway, he used to have it in his briefcase. Big silver baby. He's down on a counter. He's coming about 20 to midnight. He used to work with a 5 or 6 in the AM. And he set the briefcase down off to the side. And he would open it up and he would pull out the gun. The 357 magnet. He'd pull it out the way like, is if you were pulling out of a holster, you know? Yeah. Like a cow, and he would pull it out of the, and he would set it down in a certain spot. Just in case. Right. Well, for, I don't know, that was just him. Or he would, in the briefcase. I mean, not on the counter, but he said it over in a certain spot in the briefcase. And the night I had that rabbi in his daughter on, and the back of the days, I used to do the topical crap in screaming about religion, and I got this rabbi on there. We're screaming in a yellow and talking our thing and arguing. And Jerry comes in. It's 20 to midnight. And the rabbi is sitting there and his daughter. She's not on the air. She's just sitting there watching the show. Just soaking up the amusement. And Jerry comes in and opens up the briefcase and sits at way down at the end of the counter. And he opens it up and pulls out the gun. Well, I want to show you the eyes on rabbi bulged out. Anybody that watches passions and knows the eyes on Mrs. Wallace on Beth's mother that are bulging out of her head. That's how his eyes bulged out. And he put his hands straight up in the air. Like a whole bunch of people. I'm not making that up into two stories. And his daughter, she didn't know the scream like that, but an audible one. But she went out of gas. Kind of like, yeah, you could tell that she thought the jig was up. Yeah. The rabbi shot his hands up in the air. Like he had been shot out of a cannon. It was incredible. I should write that book you're right. You should just a little thing that's that I'm telling on the air. And this is of course the only tip of the iceberg. He ports to late. There's these are only like little tip. But they have before it's too late because once you did it's hard to write your a bio. You know? Right. Once really very difficult. Maybe I'll write it from the other side. We'll get John and I'll take it out of that. I look since I got time it's a short break. Got some bad news. One of my barbers died. I put you a long time ago. I found a great barber shop here that I really love. So, uh, come on, whatever. I think it was last Saturday. A week ago this Saturday. I go in here to get a haircut. In fact, I'd gone into the first week I came back up here. I went in because I was long overdue for a haircut. And I go out of my favorite barber shop. And there's a sign on that are closed for 12 days because of a family emergency. And of course with everything else going on in town. And there are a lot of people in the middle of the day. So, during the course of the week, I would every day when I get off the road walk over there. And I'd look and they'd have like 10 people, 10 guys sitting around waiting. And there are only one barber. Just jammed up. And I'd wave to me, wave back. But I wasn't going to sit around waiting. I just don't have the patience waiting for 10 guys to get a haircut with one guy working. So, to make a long story short, this past Saturday, I'd go in there. I got up real early the open early in the morning. I'd go in there. And again, there's my one and one of the two barber's who always got my hair. And he waves at me and I sit down and there's a guy sitting ahead of me. And he says, you know, Rocco died, which was the other barber. He was 65. He had just come my hair like a few weeks before last hair cut I had. 65, it looked like in great health, a real Italian, not a Guido, but like a real Italian from the old country. And he died. Bummer. And then he person? Yeah, it is. I don't know. I don't know. I'm going to go slash my wrist now. Yeah, it was depressing. I'm trying to get everybody into a much better mood into a list of the public. It was a pretty moat. And my barber died. 65. Stroke. Really? Yeah, stroke. Oh, I did. So anyway, I wanted to tell the story. I forgot the whole purpose of my telling you that was the guy that's getting the haircut ahead of me now. He's talking to the other barber about this other guy. And he starts talking about death and about, you know, my sister told me that she had a near death experience. And when you go to the other side, and he starts describing this whole thing about where you go. And he says the first thing on your relatives are they're waiting for you. When you get to the other side. Oh, yeah. I didn't tell you the thing on that. I don't want to go there. And so the barber looks at me, you know, because I'm sitting there waiting. And actually he looks at me like kind of like, not like, and like, like, well, I'm more like that. And when, and then the barber says, he says, I guess that. I'll depend on which direction you're going. It's kind of cute. I had a ski. I'm going to tell you in the five 60 on WQM death radio. Hey, with others day coming up just a week from Sunday. It's a perfect time to repay mom who spent so many sleepless, excruciating nights waiting for you to finally drag your ass in the house from those late night excursions when you were young stud, screwing around. Dottom mattress has the perfect mattress for mom. If it's sagging, if it's lumpy or worn out. And the bed too then gets you a great new one for mom when she comes to visit at 1-800 mattress. That's the number for diala mattress. They've got the complete line of the finest mattresses in the world. They've got sort of silly king coalescence. You know, mom sleep around something crappy and lumpy, of course not. So don't put it off another minute.

They got more repeatable for all customers than anybody because they treat their customers right. Once you buy a mattress from diala mattress, you'll never go back to a show or again.

It's straight from the Vatican, introducing new Catholic life. The religion which one third the guilt of your regular faith. New Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity, but it doesn't fill you up with a lot of doctrine. More delicate. More delicate. Catholic life, there's no confessions, no servants, and no lingering afterlife. It's the perfect alternative for modern agnastics who don't want to take any chances. Our services are held three times a year, and they're only 15 minutes long. Plus there's no added guilt for sneaking out during communion. We've dropped that too. Look for our church, Wobbill, and your neighborhood. Hey, you might be in the front view. Or ye of little faith. Try Catholic life, because a little faith is all you need.
