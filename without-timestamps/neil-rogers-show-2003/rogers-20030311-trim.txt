Yeah, they've put you to it. And I wasn't that good in the first place. Also, the most comment is the problem with him is he thinks he's the ultimate authority on everything. That's awful. And the way he talks down to the audiences, what you're saying? Exactly. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. I think he had his thumb on it. Don't you? He's a little bit kind of sending.

Is there such a thing? I don't know. Yeah, he likes to slump. I mean, Britney's a slump, but she's pristine looking. Yeah. So you don't have to be like sludgy looking, but I guess if anybody likes red or fun brown, I mean, what is there's another reason he might not like Grace Kelly. And what's that? I'm a homo. I know not Hank didn't say that mad dog. Oh, I'm sorry. Jesus, oh, you're fucking out. I'm walking out. I'm walking out ladies and gentlemen. I'm leaving. What are you trying to do here today?

I think a little bit of a hummus. Payback is a bitch. Yeah. That's right. Ripping off all the Americans treating us like crap. Taking all of our harder and money and just jowging the crap of the American public. Just because we live in the end of the thought state where we can't have gambling the way we like. But you're a little bit honest, but I said earlier, punishments worse than death. Yeah. That was excellent. That was almost not quite. But it was almost as good as angst. And trust. 560560. 560. We're getting to the end on this first poll here. And I'm thinking maybe we ought to start doing this every day. Do you like kind of a programming oriented topical? Do you understand? Yeah. Like a current kind of a thing. Like who do we despise today the most kind of a poll? And then like build on the other one. Right. And this seems to be in spite of the poll we took last week. When they said they hated this like poison. At least it'll let us to take phenomenal response. That's all we care about. We don't care if listeners are like plucking their eyeballs out with their fingers. We don't care about that. Do we know? We want to make it like nice and easy. We want to do a cop out like that bit says. It's a cop out. It's you know, we're too lazy to do the other stuff. Isn't that what it is? Well it'd be nice if we got some real calls that said something. Right. So what's the point? What's the point of beating our heads against the brick-fricot wall? Try to change the world which we're not going to do. Or we're talking to a bunch of people that don't want that in the first place. They could listen to Randy. She's going to say the world. There you go. Or they listen to the largest. He's going to make up a bunch of right wing crap. We're not interested. Oh, look at this. Oh, look at this. Mow is doing such a nice job here toward the end. As he's cutting it down under 37% now. 36.6% saying it is after the worst. He started out like almost 40% and he's brought that number down to a very disrespectful 36.6% out of 453 votes. You realize that we're going to come close. So not going to do it by 11. We're going to come close to five of our votes in two hours. And then in our 40 minutes. Aren't you shocked? Yeah. And I'm amazed at the power of Moa. If he could get numbers as big as this, we'd really have something going on in station. Impressive. I want to got seven minutes to go on the Moa pool. So you better get with it. Okay. And he or I'll choose.com. Hop on it. Here's a call from beautiful West Palm Beach, though. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. How are you? Great. Long time listener first time caller.

When I'm back in my feet again, love is a wonderful thing. When a man loves a woman, stole that from Percy Slay. I never gave him credit either. Time, love, and tenonist love is a watch to that. George out of my mind. He stole everybody. Go the distance. I will go the business. Without you, I think is the king of all. Okay. And we're number one for three weeks. And he played it so many times on the coast. On the coast. Caterwalling. Caterwalling. Kind of like, what's your name? Whitney. Maybe like Whitney on passions. So you still haven't seen, uh, what's the name of it? She got six votes. Sheridan from passions. She got six votes. And she's still getting chased all around hospital. Well, finally yesterday at the end of the show, which they'll see today. Miguel grabs the white hair nurse, but I have a feeling he was chasing, uh, Beth all around a hospital. And he caught up to some of white herders. But I think when we any has this amazed look on his face, his shot. That's going to be some old bag. It will not be Beth. Make no mistake about that. That'd be too easy. 560. Here's Wolfowitz. The war would be the liberator. Rack is what he said. Right.

We're going to liberate them from all that reading all that is stale air. Mm-hmm. They're going to liberate all the people in Cuba and Iran and North Korea and in Sudan and Libya and Syria and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and all these other grotesic places. Where people, you know, the amazing thing is Stalin who killed millions of his own people who had the biggest arsenal of nuclear weapons to anybody in the world besides us. Mm-hmm. And somehow we managed the cold war, you know, that went out for years and years. Somehow we managed to stale our lives. We didn't have to fight any war. We didn't have to like challenge him to like show down. And when we didn't have to show it on finally, you know, it was after Stalin. We had to show it on with the Ruskies. It was like, uh, Kennedy, you know, blank them in the iron they turned back. Right. Other than that, we didn't have any wars over any of it. And so if it's got to be weapons of mass destruction, I hate to break the news. Yeah. 911 is just an excuse for this bullcraft, okay? Okay. Our rack doesn't represent any threat to us whatsoever. None. Look at my count my fingers. I'm holding up a big. Oh, okay. A big war was just like a... Black dumb ass. What? Isn't it ironic that the evil Ruskies are the voice of reason right now? Yeah, isn't that something? Of course they like the oil trade they got with the rat. So that's the side of the fore. So does the other one oil.

I thought you were going to promote that. Red Sox in the, oh, in the distant future, I wait on the road. Anyway, here's some facts as it just came in. I can't believe nobody's called or facts anything from the group smash mouth for your poll. Once song in particular, I get some votes is all star. It's an commercial that they play a hell out of an echoes. Hey, now you're in all star yet. We've seen an 80 minute time. Thank you, Danny. See you right here. We're going to get that on there. Yes. Yes, Carlos. All star smash mouth. He's over there typing. He can't reach the microphone. I don't expect it here from them. Just I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, to give him time, but I have absorb into his nimble mind. Okay. He was not in that you hear it. Yeah, I heard it. Here's this code duck. I don't know. Whatever. I mean, it was a novel. I mean, what do we put all the other ones on there? Like running bare people. People who eat right. Yeah. They're in had a good one. Who let the dogs out? I mean. Oh, yeah. We're having to you heard that song. And when haven't you heard it? Most of that song was about her. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that should be on her. Who left the dogs out by the Baja boys. I remember that. I remember the video, but I was a stupid video and even stupid or song. And even stupider than that was the reaction. Of course, of the sports nerds, you know, who love to those who, who, you know, oh my God, we were playing it on a station. Oh, geez. Enough to make it gag. Who, who, who, who, who, oh, brother the pain is so great. Anyway, 12 girls I loved before. Who do you have the greasy and Willie Nelson? What are you saying? To all the girls I loved before. Yeah, it's there anyway. Like a version by Madonna. I don't think so. And it says any songs with lyrics all night long. Wasn't all night long by free? All right now. All right now. Yeah, I see. I was just to get the lyrics wrong. And I had sung it is called All Right Now. I used to think it was all night long. I don't know why. Listen to that song. Sometimes you'll see it. Yeah. Lion or Richie did all night long. But I know the song by free all right now. And I'm going to listen to Nathan. I'm saying. Sure. And as usual, he's not paying. He's got his own agenda. He's got that own Milton's spickle of Legend. This is interesting speaking of his own agenda. Bors says, clap me or no EU speech. What do you say that? I think the answer will be. No. Nine. NAY. George Borsepold out of a speech to the European Parliament when M. P.s. wouldn't guarantee a standing ovation. Senior White House officials had the president would only go to Strasbourg. He would talk about a rack if he had a staged managed welcome. A source posted in the negotiation said last night, President Bush agreed to a speech that insisted he get a standing ovation like if they stayed in the union address. His people also insisted there would be no protest or heckling. I believe it would be a crucial speech for M. P.s. to make in light of the opposition of the war here but unless he only gets a adulation in phrase and will never happen. M. P.s. Every appearance in the US is staged managed with audiences full of supporters. It was hoped he would speak after a welcome Warsaw, P.s. to NATO and prognostic. However, but as we fuse all the speech to EU leaders face the face of scenes of key factor in the split between the US and UK coalition and the rest of Europe. How do you like that, huh? G.S. Kronachron, who says, he says, I did get pissed off and fired up about the Michael Moore book control if the Democrats had any balls. They used the preamble for their campaign commercials. It's too bad more a session extremist, neither right because he's funny is hell and often right on. Right, Sean. It's true that M. P.s. B.B. goes on to say, yes, America's obsession with handguns is pathological. For example, I'm a bleeding heart, pink, o tree hugging liberal and I've got six of them and guns to and that's sad. That's very sad, Sean. One thing it's nice about here is that very, very, very few people have guns except the RCMP up here, eh? Here's his choices. Wonderful to know if I are a captain. And a emotional rescue by the Rolling Stones. You think either one of those qualified? No. No. Sorry, Sean, we love you, but the answer is no. Oh, yeah, here you go, Frank and for love. He also got one of the song that I don't mind the song the first six thousand times, but he's right. Oh, yeah, rain drops are falling on my freaking heads, his Frank and for Lodderdale. Yes, by BJ times. Oh, that's a roaring momma, is it? The hell? What was that? What was that? What was that car? Oh, is it? Got replaced. Don't blame me, it was the other spick. Oh, this one. This is what I meant to play. Yeah. Sorry, wrong button. I'm going to grab some of my freaking head by BJ Thomas. There are many others that recorded it, but he had the definitive version of you asked me. And as much as I do like BJ, I'd like BJ Thomas a lot, I like BJs. But man, hold the foot. What? BJs, hold the foot. No, just BJs in general. Here's one of the says from you, see if Kenny, great pool, sting don't stand so close to me. Yeah, we like sting, but we don't like that song. That's right. That's a good choice, you see, if Kenny. We could tell like, what? Put it on the pole by the police and stuff to do it. Almost thing was with the police. So I think I picked up by the police. He was with it. He was a lead singer. Okay, they'd be a lead. Okay, G.C. What I mean, Kenny? Oh, we got a real hard ass today. Like we really have to work out, getting it right. This is the same outfit that spells Donkey Chain with an EY, you know? You went piggy, Y, C, A, A, and Donkey Chain, you know?

They are the most stereotypical. Of course, a lot of the rappers are too. I mean, just I don't get out and get that. But talk about creating a nasty, nasty way. I mean, they're walling a cuckoo. Yeah. They're annoying. In fact, if we wanted to pick the most annoying group, maybe that's a good one for you one day. The most annoying group in history, Destiny's child.
