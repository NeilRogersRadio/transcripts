Congressional office at least until midnight last night On the Monday of a long 4th of July holiday weekend when Congress was not even in session The doom plane was a small private beachcraft piloted by an unidentified American according to Constable Mike Hale Hales of the Toronto Marine Unit speaking at a press conference yesterday afternoon He'll said the Adi Adi Adi Adi on a plane held seven people including pilots six passengers And it goes out about how they try to confirm with Harris's office It says it curiously at least one person was working quite late in Harris's congressional office last evening As their calls seeking come was answered at 1035 p.m. Most strangely the female who answered the phone did not initial identify that we'd even reach the office of US Congresswoman It would be the normal procedure thus indicating that the woman was likely not a member of Harris's regular staff So we asked again whether was her office. Yeah, it is the woman said softly We're upon we answer to confirm or deny that Catherine Harris died in the plane crash yesterday morning the woman Somberley told us reporter no comment were busy goodbye hanging up the phone at around 1036 last night We called back again around midnight to same woman answered the phone. We again asked whether representative Harris had died in the plane crash in the morning The woman said I only answered the phone thinking he was somebody else I don't have the authority to answer that question goodbye She said hang out at the phone around midnight.

I'll charge malester and suicide case gets ten years probation suspended a sentence basically is what a boy's down there A 35 year old man was sentenced to ten years of probation years that after admitting him a less to the boy at least twice of our 15 years ago The victim was not in court yesterday however Chris Hammond shot himself to death April 28th Just days after ordering his abuser would likely never go to prison he was 27 he's dead And this guy gets ten years probation Hammond said he was molested over a two month period when he was a child by man He called Uncle Freddy later identified as Frederick Irresiri The attached occurred at Irresiri's coconut creek home. All the victim was in Irresiri's care when police contacted Irresiri Quickly confessed according to police and court records Criminal charges were filed Irresiri was looking at life in prison for raping the boy Irresiri was about 20 at the time of the crime. There was a problem however The defense raised a question about whether Hammond was 11 or 12 when he was abused Hammond's age at the time was crucial if he was 11 there's no statute limitations for prosecuting the abuser But if he was 12 the time limit already had run out With Hammond's death just weeks past Irresiri on Monday pleaded guilty in two counts of attempted sexual battery of a child 12 years or older and addition to a decade of probation Irresiri has to register as a sexual offender have no contact with any trial under 18 Take in past two polygraph test a year ago officials a DNA sample so can be entered in the database But no jail time ten years probation because of a technicality because the kid wasn't 11 he was 12 and I was dead And that enough to make your blood brought by a boy.

Is that just came running in here to tell us that NBC called studio to tell us that it was I'm in a way on you assholes at NBC aren't you embarrassed at MSNBC at a fire Michael Savage after putting him on in the first place Isn't that pretty embarrassing? The peacock has got its tail between his legs MSNBC yesterday fired that right wing fascist Michael Savage for anti-gay comments The popular radio talk show hosted in a weekend TV show for the desperate cable channel referred to an unidentified Caller to wish show Saturday as a Sodomite and City should get AIDS and die His comments were extremely inappropriate and the decision was an easy one MSNBC spokesman Jeremy Gaines said There was no immediate comment from Savage according to a spokesman as office California The branch tough talking savage is one of radio's hottest juxtices here His Paul reverse society advocates closing borders deporting illegal immigrants mediating health test Vermeagance and eliminating entitlement programs The televised version of the Savage nation began March 8 despite the protest of such anti-Sig groups as the gig and lesbian lines against defamation air did 5 p.m. on Saturday Savage didn't translate into a TV hit he increased ratings for the timeslaught marginally according to MSNBC In other words, they probably went from a 0.1 to a Only two or something like that nothing The incident that resulted in this firing began initially and off Savage was taking viewer phone calls about the airline horror stories and a male caller began talking about smoking in the bathroom Half an hour into the flight. I need to suggest that don't in Mike take your something the caller said before he was cut off in his words Became unintelligible Do you know what I think the caller said? Don't in Mike Plow So you're one of those Sodomites are you a Sodomite's avidast the caller replied yes. I am oh You're one of the Sodomites avid said you should only get AIDS and die you pig house that why not to see if you can sue me you pig You've got nothing better than to put me down you piece of garbage you got nothing to do today So go eat a sausage and choke on it He asked another phone caller didn't have a nice light in the bathhouses angry at me today These bombs mean nothing to me. He said Lance books woman Kathy Renna said of Savage's firing. It's a vote time The latest detect made the clearest case for why Savage has no place on any reputable news network MSNBC witnessed firsthand exactly the kind of verbal assaults glad the warning them about for the past five months into their quit At they backed up their promises told them accountable and they fired his right wing ass As if it makes a difference I mean he as far as TV was concerned Didn't even make a blip on a rectus scale and you know who else doesn't make a blip on radio? I give up I see that Glenn Garven in the Harold has got this big big glowing piece over the weekend about Bill or Riley and about how he's kicking ass on TV He and he talks about his three million listeners nationwide on radio You know how many there are in South Florida Yeah, he doesn't eat doesn't even crack a zero. It doesn't make a point one on a radio in South Florida And since you're writing the column in the Harold and in South Florida Glenn Garven you might want to mention it and there, but of course you wouldn't because it's obviously a puppies Sucking up to the right wing Representative Katherine Harris is alive and well her office announced that he respond to an internet rumor to the contrary Jennifer Platten the Congresswoman's office had Harris arrived in a Washington office yesterday after him Following the July 4th break a website is sending hers was killed in a plane crashing Canada Harris is author of the center of the storm published by WND books which tells how she dealt with the controversy surrounding the fixed Tuta I mean the 2000 presidential election and the party played when she was Florida Secretary of State and Sucking jab bushes, but or whatever whatever she was sucking on How do you like that she's still alive?

They found no education of illegal activity But that they would check to see if any complaints have been filed the week-long summer camp run by the American Association for nude recreation outside of Tampa allows kids eight eleven away teen to get together for games sports and discussions about their choice to stay in the buff I want to make sure that they're properly regulated properly Secure and they're not gonna have kids come in contact with undesirable said Foley a West Palm Beach closet queen Republican is running for US Senate nudist who met with Foley say they wanted him to stop harassing the camp now that state official said it was legal It's a fundamental freedom in this country makes such personal choices Surely Mason executive director of beaches foundations to the group that supports clothing for beaches Senate and statement Hey, I got this for a Mark Foley if you want to start investigating something a stick you know is a little bit deeper into the Catholic church the pre scandal since we've always cracked the tip of the iceberg If you want to find some real child molesters some real pedophiles Anyway Speaking of misfudge Let's see here's the fact this is what is a fag hang I really want to know Ha And there's serious obviously Yeah, they are what is a fag hang well a fag hang is a female a heterosexual woman who for some reason Has an affinity a an obsession for hanging out with male homosexuals you got it right first visit in high school as an Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Jackson as in Brook Shields and Michael Jackson and Is in Liza Manelli and Judy Garland any a gay man and That kind of thing as in my friend Lynn Samuels and Miss Fudge and the list is long. That's what a fag Higgas. I don't know where that expression came from. I don't know but just they run Fag hang I Where didn't amag That and so to have to be an old mag. Yeah Here's one it says I need to share with you what is probably a classic wrestling box experience since moving to Jersey Continuous new show work by the web thank god on Thursday Work let out early for the holiday in the car was slipping to the stations up here came across rush Ranting and raving about what is supposedly the new meaning of the words American and patriotism He was angered by the fact that some people are claiming that the qualifies in American or patriot one must speak out against the US government government policy As support for his spiel he played the off-year incentive delivery Clinton speech Professor that being a mercant means having the right to be free to speak out Of course he wasn't advocating that to be American one must exercise this right never lessens his speech was probably already discredited merely because it came across as shrill and Scree as screeching weeks ago It was logical to rush that it could be substantively the substantively discredited as well As his show as an opinion based it's his right and his listeners right to disagree with the views however He totally missed interpreted what he said and once he says it becomes gospel on his show and blindly followed by his listeners right as Rush spoke I found myself sitting in my car shouting no no at the radio knowing that his followers were not gonna get it If his listeners understood he showed to be sat there a comedy. I'd read these year keep up the work good work We go ahead and say this law. Thank you very much in Jersey. Okay. Why you listen to that crap all right? I've had that accident pressure to button on the dial there's rush. What the? And I immediately punch another button. I don't hang around cut it on the first bounce. Yeah. That's right. I mean why so dick yourself to that crap Because one thing you won't get any surprises on at show Like finding out the Karen and her Katherine Harris might be here's a lady in Cooper City. Hello I ain't gonna yell how are you pretty good. How you doing? I'm doing good. I have no idea why I think this woman It's a lesbian maybe just because she would marry to Tom Cruise. I'm sure it's okay And I think they were covering for each other, but Nicole Kidman just I don't know there's nothing about her just a little She's never linked with any men. She's a little butchy a little butchy something she's always When you see pictures of her with another woman who they say her friend So I don't know she's just vicious to me. Yeah, those pictures where they've got their tongues done each other's gross Always raise some questions in my mind Sometimes, you know, you just you just get rubbed the wrong way so to speak. Yeah I said stop a red fat a flag in my mind. Yeah, so that's my choice And I have a question for you. Why exactly on a DVD is it is an Easter egg? It's something we're out to post an all-bought. Oh, it's it's it's a it's a segment or it's a format of the movie You're watching that you can get only by doing certain little things that you never know about unless and if you go to that website E eggs.com E eggs.com and you look up under movies and then we'll have it like DVDs and click on the DVD And then I'll have a whole list now for medical order of movies not all of them of course, but I mean like a hundred of them and you go to the movie Like my mentor for example, do you ever see that? No, I actually just bought it for my father-in-law, so I have a second Okay, okay, tell the scrubber that the movie is backward in other words it's potentially made backward Well, there's a way there's an Easter egg on that if you click a certain thing and you watch Do whatever that you can see it in chronological order. Oh, see what I'm saying So in other movies on DVDs, it's not it won't change the order of the movie, but something funky Oh, yeah, sometimes you'll see like how takes like for example and Magnolia They showed some time cruise flooding his lines and they're them cracking up So yeah, some neat things like that That was that that was ordinary pedestrian non-computer geeks and that's the most of all about That's run it a no-folk.

Yeah, I'm so kidding Our s after Redmond declared his desk Bush ordered a GBP $25 million bounty on Saddam's head He wants Saddam dead to rely on the same goes for bin Laden already Bush's agreed to Either man for going to trial and being shot after interrogation The official reason given for Redmond's abrupt departure was health reasons But stun colleagues in the homeland secuted Department of Washington Where Redmond had his office insist the former associate director of the CI was in perfect health Is the departure is led to intense speculation That he may have begun to uncover embarrassing details about the software Came into the hands of Saddam and bin Laden Let me read that first sentence again America's top spy catcher Paul Redmond is suddenly residing in the middle of a secret investigation Into how Saddam and Osama allegedly obtained US computer software Which is said to enable the two most wanted men in the world to avoid capture Because it can pinpoint every move in the global manhand It kind of like a scene from born identity Where they were like pinpointing I mean it's a pretty neat movie I think you'd enjoy it. It's on the list Where they can watch every street in the world They can bring it up on a computer and they can see who's on a street and they can zero in And they can zoom in your turlet and you're into your echo It's amazing Pretty damn good stuff And of course probably that's the way to win anyway It's probably coming if you ask me In fact, I want to swore and I saw Jim Bush and my balcony about a half an hour ago Bits you me out about that Katherine Harris story Too bad, Jim too bad it's not true. Wouldn't that have been a scandal huh? Oh yeah wouldn't that have been something So whoever created that funny story in there and that nice job because that he put all the pieces together very nicely What do you hear what I'm hearing? What do you hear? Oh maybe that's outside. I don't know. Maybe they're like drilling or whirling I hear like so because everything is so nice and quiet You know? Beautiful day by the way. It's 80 going to be like good. It's going to be 80. It's going to be more than that But it's beautiful sunny not a climb to sky. I just mentioned that in passing. How's the weather in south Florida? Beater boy? Actually this is the first day in like 20 that has a rate. All right. Oh right. Not even noon yet. Okay. It's not even noon. It's not time yet for those big cumulus clouds to start forming Over the Everglades and then sweeping across the state Here's a call from this is amazing. It's not even noon yet. We've already got our second lady of the day in Boiton Beach. Hello. Hi there. How are you? Good. I'm going to go out. How are you? Pretty good. Good. Kind of couple for you. But these might be obvious. Several times. Don't even know what a bag bag is. Oh yeah. There's so much love. There's so much love. You know, even if you didn't know the name. Right. You know what? Anyway, Helen Hunt of course. Right. You know, Helen Hunt? Sure. Absolutely. Okay. Her ex-beard tank is area. You know Linda Evans and Yank and Yani, right? Linda Evans is a dyke. Yeah. Absolutely. Come on. Absolutely. Inside and so. Okay. How about? Yeah. So. You're going to plan it out or get those on your on your from their website. No. No. No. No. No. No. Okay. My dike sister. For it's in to me. My Tyson. Hates is my mom left him. Hey, swimming. My Tyson is a dyke. This little. I'd be. And Janet Jackson might be a bag. I don't know. And you're a congenent Michael together. Oh, yeah. She's got five votes already. Jen, excuse me. I don't know. Yeah. But she might be Michael. I don't know. We can't say men. We can't. No, we've already done that a million times. We even said if you want to, but we've done that. You know, been there and done that. All right. Anybody we might not suspect? I don't know. I think Helen Hunt's pretty obvious if you know, but that might be a revelation to some people. Maybe Miss Fudge of him put it on her website. I think I might. Right next to Katherine Harris. Have a great day. Sweetheart. Hey, what covia enjoy your vacation. Oh, you said the right things. Thanks. Bye. What covia bank blows. Okay. In case anybody has no, if you're thinking about opening a new account, southward, did not go to first union, what covia, okay, under peddly adept, they suck. They will terrorize you. They'll destroy your day. You're weak. Your life. And certainly your holiday weekend. God. How'd you like to be a big shot like me and make the kind of money that I'm. Well, see. Because you're going to say, yeah. Okay. But let me just finish and go to your ATM. Not that I would. Brand short of cash. Thank goodness. Because I, you know, me. I'm like a walk in bank. I got a few hundred American. I got a few hundred euros. In my sack. I've already got some. A spirit that I could always get through the change place. But the point being you go to your ATM is like a routine with me. You know, when you get the best exchange rate by getting it out of the ATM, you stick your card in there and it goes. And you're like the little man inside the machine. I'm like, who are you can, man? Your, your financial institution says you ought to be institutionalized because you don't have got no cash. Well, let me tell you, it's worse when you're not a big shot when you still have a lot of money. When you don't have a lot of money, when you don't have a big, a lot of a lot of money to fall back on a road wall. Right. That's even worse. That's right. And you're very, very careful to make sure that you don't make any mistakes. And still. And which bank is that? And you know something. And you know something. And it's cool. I haven't had anybody call in a day recommend to me a bank, which I was hoping would happen. I would give me some, some friendly personal service and not keep putting a hold on my deposit. Well, I didn't watch him to mutual. That's for sure. They suck. Yes. Hard. Oh, God. And of course, like I said, the people are working banks. I used to think, oh, you know, Tom Jones. He's a, he's a bank vice president. Everybody's a bank vice president. They're making about 15 grand a year as what that means. So nice title. But that means they're a flunky. Oh, to lime us those days of friendly family bank and Matt Corshop. And my good friends, I knew everybody in there. They knew me. There was never a chance that they were going to screw up my account ever. Not a chance. With these people if they get it right, it's a freaking miracle. You, you, you kiss the ground. You start rubbing your rosary beads. You rub it real hard. If they ever get your goddamn deposit right at first, you need to walk Kobe. A man is suck. You people make me sick. I should sue their ass. You know what? Just for the stress factor. Okay. Is that a God. I'm showing Fox the stress factor. Yeah, let's all sue their ass. And evidently, I wasn't the only one because the long July fourth holiday weekend. You know, they had extra opportunity to screw up people's accounts when it We're desperately hoping to get some cash. Oh, well, it's in our policy. If you read the fine print. They send it. These little brochures that everybody smith cans and throws in a waste basket. You know, a little a message from your bank. You know, from first unit and the print is so small. You couldn't read it with a magnifying glass. Neashmith can't even throw it away. You see, it's nothing. And then there may be maybe they said, well, our new policy is, you know, if we don't like the way you look or it's not the right there. We're too busy. We can't be bothered. Not put in a hole on your deposit. Even if you're the biggest deposit in our bank. Let me say again, you people suck. You make me nauseous. Don't do it again. Okay. Do not do it again. Now, again, not the new deal is every time I make it a deposit. I got a send John in there to the bank. If I'm not in town, which is most of the time, I got to send the somebody in there with the deposit and handed to this broad who's sitting at the desk. And she scribbles a little thing on air like, you know, like a little, like a little like a hex. She puts some kind of Jamaican hex on me when she sends him back to the garden. Yeah, that's it. To the teller. Teller what? Tellers that she's full of crap. 18 till noon at five, 60, WQM for the next two weeks. It's a special holiday deal. Let's see for the next week.

Oh my god, those biceps, it says, and you are. I'm so lonely correct. Are you really pushed him up for that movie, man? He looked really, really good, especially for him. Mac Damon, I just mentioned that in passing. I think that's a good movie. Even audio heteros out there will enjoy born identity. Here's one, Mike and Cooper City saw a great movie. The day I'm video tape, the pawn broker with the director of the city, Lomet and the Rod Stiger. Well, first of all, Rod Stiger was great. He's dead. He was great. He died not that long ago.

The pawn broker, three and a half out of four bones. 1965, a Jewish pawn broker in Harlem is hunted by his growing experiences, Nazi camptering the Holocaust. Powerful and well done, probably staggered best performance adapted from an aval by Edward Lewis Wong. I've seen it several times. It's outstanding. Do we also the first time I saw catch twenty two, the most important scene to be cut out. It's to be pretty memory that Adam Markin has that explains the motive for all assassins. I didn't understand it. I'm not in the sense you're a version. It made your giveaway hint. This involvement. What the fuck are you talking about? It says, it makes me wonder what other good movies we haven't seen can't get because they've been banned or whose meaning has been changed through censorship. Good point, Michael Cooper's that he so buy your DVDs that blackbuster whatever you do. At slack, busted. They suck. Not as bad as what Kobe a bank. Here's a lady in coconut creek, hello.

Yeah, I'm not sure she's on that view show and then she start that show. Yeah, I think that's all. Let's be exactly. But I don't want to, you know, I don't know their name. So I don't want to.

It's been Friday from 10 to 2. Right. Right. Also, that poll you to the other day about the best. Well, the actor you would not go see in a movie. How about a poll for what movie you would go see? So it's because of actors in it or an actress or a movie. Well, that's a good idea for this day. It's like draw you to a movie. That's an excellent idea for Thursday, like I said. Personally, if you were going to go see a movie just because of an actor, it would have been. Oh. Oh. That's very tough. I don't know. I may be a mad Damon now. Yeah. Well, he's been down in the house. I'm going to go rent the foreign identity because of you. That's very good. You like it. Okay. Well, very unusual also. Okay.

The easy the smart way to get you a great night sleep for months and years to come. Max, we'll let's ban. All right. The 28th one going to set my screen going set my screen on fire. We're the whole lot of people. The redder screen tried to prove they're not real tired. But this year my very only story. Or prove she can sing as good as her daddy. She loves a lot of song put away on me. Lisa and Vegas. Lisa and Vegas. I know there are lots of other gals who are gone. We're the whole way and sing. But let's face folks. There's only one who knows how to sneer like the king. Or some real big divas on VH1. But almost all of their careers are done. So please watch my daughter because I got no song. Watch Lisa and Vegas. Lisa and Vegas. Lisa and Lisa and Vegas. That's a good 506 to you. How could we have forgotten Lisa and Maria? Thank you very much, Cynthia and Miami. Who says Lisa and Maria, please? I hope we've forgotten that. I don't know how to say that. What a bad oversight that was, huh? You know what? Always sense you sit for me. Scientology. Oh yeah. I'm just mentioning that in passing. Nothing necessarily connecting them there. Right. 314 votes on our Dijkpool. Which of these female celebrities you most strongly believe is a Dijk. Hillary Clinton 145, Hillary's an elite of her own man. She's way way out there in front and nobody's going to catch her ugly ass. Tony Foster, those given her a run, she's got 73 and that's how Tony. That's everybody else like it. We stand in still. Well, it's our fault. We should. Well, it's probably a good thing we didn't put her right in the beginning. To be right on the hell with his ass. Jamie Lee Curtis 36, you know that she's Tony Curtis's daughter. You do know that. Yes, I do. Bernie Schwartz. You know what he likes. Mariah Carey's got 12. Anna Cornoholia 11. J. L. O. Nine. Segorni weaver nine. Brittany Spears got eight. I can't tell you by whom. Janet Jansson eight and the cool Kevin's got a pair. Probably bigger than Tom Cruises. Anyway, this story about Jim Bush and Ernie Eves. If you only knew what a smuck or an Eves was. You'd realize this is a match made in purgatory. A match made in Moosteraw. God, what a couple of assholes. So here's this big, low and picture. They're both smiling and laughing. Jim Bush up here. Thank God he's out of here today. Bye, my Jim. Have a safe trip home. You asshole. And the story says that the headline. The headline says Canada and US so close. They look alike. Jim Bush says. The striking similarities between Canada and the US. Overshadow and the disagreements between the government and the two countries. Jim Bush, the governor of Florida said yesterday. In fact, there's little to identify Canada's a foreign country. Investing Americans, Mr. Bush said. On his first trade in tourism promotion mission to Canada. This this this paragraph here ended in Toronto. Didn't have to go through customs. I wouldn't know. I was in a foreign country. He said, Mr. Bush, the brother of US President George W. Bush. Many Canadians have the same feeling if they flew into one of our cities. I told you this story a long time ago. But how when I was a little kid in the first time, I thought we got to slept over to Niagara Falls and crossed over from Niagara Falls in the York in an Niagara Falls Ontario. And once we crossed the border and went into Canada, I kept wondering, where is all the snow? Of course, it was the middle of the summertime. Right. And I was like a little tiny kid. Where's all the snow? Many Canadians have the same feelings that they flew into one of our cities. Hey, look at that. There's some big buildings and there's some cars. There's some roads and there's a store. And here's another McDonald's. What an asshole man. And then there's a whole big spread on this story. Toronto versus Miami. Now, see, they narrow it down. Miami meaning date county to the Toronto City is opposed to the GTA, the Metro Population because Metro Toronto is five million people. But anyway, date county, they got two million children, 12,000. Toronto, two million, four million, eight thousand. So they're trying to make a similarity there. Hispanic population, Miami 57.3% Toronto 9.3%. Black population, Miami 19% Toronto just 8.3%. All right. Fullyage, Miami palm trees, Toronto fir trees. Architectural flourish, Miami art deco, Toronto pool in the condo. Typical TV character, Miami's sunny crocket and Miami vise, Toronto, Joey, Jeremiah and the grassy junior high. Recreational drug, Miami cocaine, Toronto Starbucks. Election debacle, Miami hanging chaired Toronto running Drag queens. Most common former transportation Toronto TTC that's a subway, Miami roller blades. Most famous Latino visitor, Toronto Ricky Martin, Miami, Ilian Gonzalez. Waterfront creatures, most threatened by urban development, Toronto Tensity residents, Miami manatees. Tolest building. Here's one that made my blood boil when I saw it. Do you know what the Tolest building in Miami is? I thought it was that one that looks like a staircase. It's the Wacobia Financial Center 55 stories. I got some stories for the people of Wacobia. More than 55. At least just this weekend. Not third man. Lots of stories 55 stories Toronto to see in Tower 181 stories. Of course these days you don't want to have too many big buildings. Gay rights Toronto marriages been legalized. Miami to legal for a man to wear any kind of strapless gown. And it goes on. Pretty interesting stuff because you know he landed at the airport. If they wouldn't have put them through customs and said, boilers that asshole got a flora. He would have thought he was like anywhere in the US like Toledo. For our dicholist, here's one that says, How about King O' Queen Latifa? Queen Latifa. I honestly think her package is bigger than mine. Well I'm sure it's bigger than mine. Which ain't same much. Queen Latifa, let's get that big nasty bitch on there right away. Did we ever get Whitney Houston on there? Did we? Yeah, she didn't have any votes yet. Or look at that. There's a whole bunch of them that just went on there. Look at that. That's excellent. Nice going Eric. Although a little bit slow that's venerable is followed. I'm sure. Well that's because venerable is busy putting all those bedtime stories on there right? Yes sir. Yeah. Because he showed up about a minute to 10 today. Not late, not late, but a minute to 10 because he had issues. You know this is a man's always got issues. 560, 50560, on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Ever since parents attacked him last week in the hallway, he's just never been a same again. Here's Carl Gables. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes sir. Yes, Woody Graber. How you doing? No, Woody Graber again. She's this. What are you becoming like chronic? Well, we were talking about things. And I got to tell you about my bag. Like I said, it's your great here from Woody Graber today. It's exceptional. Melan United National Bank. Smellin? Melan. Melan. And I got to tell you one of the managers I deal with is a big nearly. Oh, thank God. But before the hell am I going to find one of those by me? I'm not. They are there in Broward and in Jay. I know. I mean, they're, they're national. They're around the country. Really? Yeah. But they can probably set up anything you want because your, your check comes from there, right? Right. From down here. So they can come up. I'll be glad to give you a name and number off the air. If you want. You have no idea how great there would be. The minute that I set my foot back on Florida, Soreland a few weeks. I, that's the first thing I'm going to do is switch banks. I got to tell you, Melan has sent over backwards for me. They have been so wonderful. I mean, you know, Um, yeah, I just a poor, schlepper off the street for saying how. Now, I'm way, let me ask you this. That Melan Bank. That's not connected with the Pittsburgh family. Like Richard Melan's scape and would that, that outfit is it? I don't know quite honestly. Because I have a feeling if I put my money in that bank, I might like vanish overnight. You know, I might like an accident. There's a tag that left the wing pink or a tag. Yeah, they might do not like me too much. No, this guy, these guys are great. They're just wonderful. And I got to tell you, like I said, one of the branch managers, Greg, got to deal with, he just like he says, Well, I'll tell you what, I'll put you on hold and be in your boy can take his name and he info and that would be great. I'd really appreciate it because I like to find a bank where they give me a little bit of service just to look. I'm not asking for a lot. Just don't put a hold and scrub might of pauses. That's all. They would never scrub your deposits. They'd never screw you up one of mine. Excellent. Yeah. Definitely. Okay. Hang on, Woody. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. All right. No problem. Take care. Okay. Take care of my good close personal friend. Woody, Greg, we're online one there. Bein' or boy. I like I said, I've always led to hear from Woody. He's never said when I heard his voice all the time. Yeah. But do I guess who I heard yesterday on the racing channel? How's he doing? He's doing good. Call on the races from Colorado Race Course. 321 votes on the pool.

You know, 3 hours 45 minutes has plenty. And then tomorrow because George is always with that monkey sea monkey, doodial. Another Marlin Cup game at 145 pregame. So you're going to like that with that idea. And being Wednesday that means that George is going to play the comedy but it's out from 1245 to 145. Thanks to my, uh, getting him smart.

Now what did you say minute ago? There's a bit called one fell. And the name of the movie was now. Oh, no. No. I couldn't understand. He was talking in some of the language. I don't know. He was speaking in a Greek. So I guess we'll have to play that right, Phil. We ought or not in here. Oh, come on. Not in here. After I put 80 billion bits into this DCS over the way. It's not a thing. You know what? That might even be a rock comedy. Yeah. I don't know. Anyway, we don't got it. 1213 at 560 WQAM. Jody Foster highly overrated. That's all I want to tell you right now. Not in too many good movies. A thousand mediocre movies. Not too many good ones. She's not good. She's not good. No. Didn't you like was it? Dr. Leiter. No. I think affected us. Right. Exactly. Which is probably one of the day said it was money. But there may have been somebody to say, you know what? Why bring that bitch back anyway? Dr. Leiter. Dr. Leiter. He was awful. No, what did he want to kill that? He wanted to kill that slut. In fact, and that was the one part of the movie when I was definitely rooting for him. Clarice. Clarice. 1214 at 560 WQAM as we went our way up through the Big Marlin Cup. Game of God, Darnell on them on. That's what Beter Boy tells me. And that was you said Darnell will us pitch into the day. Come on. Seriously. Learn into felwood. Don't know. You know, when your hair is all fall out and clumps and leaves that big shiny balls. But who was I watching the other day on TV? Somebody had like a who the hell was it? I mean, I was shiny. Ball spun. I wanted to like wax your ball spun. Remember the paint the balls. But they wanted this guy waxed it. Will it sky? No. I never see what it's got because I don't want to show. Who the hell was it? Was some actor with a really just shiny. Like, man, you could see the reflection of a millimage. He could have been like a lighthouse. And that's what happens a lot of guys. But I'm curious. The guys like professional people who are like actors and things like that. They like shine it. They wax it. There's a special wax. Seriously? Nope. Oh. Anyway, yeah, Paul's podcast wax. But if you're got one of those guys, millions and millions of people out there just desperate to get some of that hair back and look younger and better.

Hmm, this is Dick Kenny. I like to relax by having Mary Magdalene massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers for the one hour. Hey, is that what you would think about? It's I was. See, I did it. Audiences love now. The story of a girl who developed her own strange language, well being raised by a stoking paired mother. Now, Jodie Foster returns to the screen as a girl raised by a deaf mute epileptic, who has learned to communicate by making unintelligible noises and hurling herself to the ground. Look, Doctor, I think the girl is trying to communicate with us. Oh, you're hungry. You're sleepy. You want to lie down. I'm hungry. You want to lie down repeatedly. Watch as this free spirit its strong will to girl, and she's going to express joy. Anger. Rrrr. Curiosity. Rrrr. Even love. Jodie Foster stars in fell. They're running away, hit, that as audience is falling out of their seats. So, it's a real picnic. Okay, we must have another handgun story. It's his checkout scene and is your cable still out? No, it's there now. But, yeah, we're having a familiar with Meridian. He's joining us now on the phone, Mr. Mayor. I'm sorry to have to report this horrible story. Tell us what you know about the specific details. This morning, sometimes, on a Friday, at the scene, and, oh, this is not confirming the exact numbers, but we have multiple depth of the injuries. The scene has been secure for some time now. We've been on the scene for about an hour. The employees are in the facility and it's been administered to team of clergy. This assembled here on the site where the family members have come in out of being assembled across the highway where they're also being seen to be members of the clergy. Obviously, unspeakable tragedy here on town. Any word, Mr. Mayor, on a possible motive? No word at this point. Do you know the identity of the shooter? The identity of the shooter is known. We're not releasing that at this time. He killed himself. I'm going to now notify affected family members first before. There you go. Shooting at a plant in Meridian, Mississippi, and a gunman, Kim Shod himself. There's more dead people in America with guns. So anyway. Yes. Where'd you find that bit? Hey, listen, I got my cramped together here. I understand. It's on the best in the 1995. The one we don't have here. Well, the one I got in my hand right now. The other one. I got it. I played it fell. Rimes with no and smell and pel mel. Smoking if you got him. So anyway, here's thanks very much for tipping me off on it. Where's that stand again on the murders in 2001? City of Miami and City of Toronto, not my toy areas. But we're no actually date counting. But the same population. Two points you may end 2.480 effects of Toronto is the higher. Murders in 2001, Miami, 204, Toronto 59. Got that? Got it sounds like a little more than 4 to 1 to me. Let me just give you one reason why there's more people getting murdered in a Miami than in Toronto. That's it. You've got the answer. What is more people getting murdered in Detroit than Ottawa? Yeah. Here's the fact this is great mad Damon movie. The movie Rounders about high stakes poker. Would John Malkovitch, John Tuturo, Martin Landau, Edward Norton, and Gretchen Mall. You seen Rounders? Nope. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad at all. Like Matt Damon, why? Oh yeah, you like Matt Damon. Yeah, well I do. He's good. And he can act pretty good too. What's the other movie I saw this week and that I haven't seen in the Zidine years that you liked a lot? War the world for 1953. Oh yeah. Actually it was on one of my driving movie channel or whatever. The former ball and it was on there again. They shot that one. They yeah, the preacher walks up and he's got the the Bible and he's got the cross and it but it would be better. The shuttle. That was in him. What's he him, no, Mo. Here's one of his put Miss Elliott on your list. He's been more chicks than a mother bird to chuck in my who knows Miss Elliott. Miss Elliott. Missy. Miss the meaner Elliott. He's that. That black red lady. I don't know. Missy Elliott. Is that her name? Yeah. Well get a ride chuck in my name but thank you. Get around the list. Missy and whatever name is Missy. Here's the facts from Sergio again who says don't do it in the amelun back is the same Richard melons. I'm not I'm not going to bank there. Thanks anyway. Woody. Not going to do it. I mean you have to have some principles in life right? Who would be like like you going out and shopping at Walmart today. Never happened. Isn't it happen? And there's no chance in my banking. I, I, I, nothing against the guy that's over there. I wish him all the luck in the world. I'm glad he enjoys the show and I hope he doesn't take it personal. I will not do business with any institution connected with the melon family from Pittsburgh. Go care. Will the Richard melons get the answer to us? No. Or Florida, sir. Just right. Yeah. Just one of those things like I said you have to have a few principles. I mean, if he was the only bank in the world, then he had no choice. I'm still thinking bank Atlantic is what I'm hearing is really good. I just hit you facts on them. That's my bank. Oh, well, don't be mention in my name in here with your dead be to count.

We'll just draw them from your account. Hmm. But they do give really good personal service. But bank Atlantic. Yeah. What do you want to know? I'm sure you're in or like every other day.

I think that Jodie is going to give Hillary a run for it. She might just get close up on her ass. What did the disgusting thought that is? I mean, is there any guy out there, any head of her, sir? Any guy of any persuasion that would like to see Jodie Foster in some kind of a sexual encounter with anything? No. I don't think so. What's upon a time 100 years ago? What? She was a cute dog. Yeah.

Hell, we probably won't even be successful. And that's pretty damn depressing. But as usual with every problem, there is a solution. Hi.

Think about it. Need some cash? Rob a bank. Don't have enough money for fear? Or the convenience store. Take some chips and pretzels wire in. It's all free. You've got a handgun. Some son of a bitch, cheating on your girlfriend? Kill him. To simple solution, a life's complex problems. Why have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the court. Hell, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares? By the damn thing of the street. Just buy a lot of handguns. It's a great alternative to working problems out and it'd be considered a population control. Yes, handguns. They just might make your fans. Puff 33 at 5. 6. You know, I'm sitting here and looking out by window. It's a beautiful day and I'm thinking, you know, I could be a bataving New York. I could be in Kalamazoo. Nusers. I see people walking around. I see cars. I see streets and buildings. I see London. I see France. I see a restaurant day. And I'm thinking I could be like in Pittsburgh. I could be in. If salinity Michigan. I could be in Sacramento, California. Looking out the window. I'm just thinking these because, you know, Jebo, she here is done right on it. Here's a good fast from carry. At least I hope it's good. This is up there with bank Atlantic for over 20 years. The people are friendly. They never made any of it. In fact, in my poor days, they actually covered a couple of slightly overdrawn checks. Also they're open on Saturday and Sunday. That's what, uh, for Alwa San. Remember? Yeah. He was touting bank Atlantic. Because he said, I'll call the uploads. His what he said. He's absolutely correct. I'll call the uploads. They suck. Man. Well, that's the policy. But where do they find these people? What's the obsession that they have with hiring these certain. I don't want to get into a whole thing. You know, ethnic thing. But these Jamaican kind of people. You know, I'm talking to each cheap. These imperious Jamaican women who have got a real crappy attitude and make it very clear. That they're not way to give a crap about you even if you're the biggest depository in their institution. They don't care because they got a whole lot of other angry people stating that they're just called a toll free 800 number and mess with them. Okay. But she ain't got time for me. Bitch. God. Man, you can't complain about the service they give you because they don't give you none. They suck. And did you mind me to make my point about that the first union of my Kobe bank sucks? Don't forget to, uh, okay. Okay. You bank. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Yes, man. You're missing the biggest richest die in the United States for your poll. Look at me a clue because that's all I could be in her. She got it. I got it. Oprah Winfrey. Oh, my God. Oh, yep. That's her. How could we have left Oprah. Wow. No, about about it. Ha ha ha. Thanks for the reminder. We're just getting a little old and feeble. You know how that goes. That's okay. Same goes here. Take your meal. You too, bye-bye. How could we forget Oprah? Yeah. Oh, but she's going to marry her. What's his name Maxwell still in the set on the earth? What a real name is. Oh, yeah. They're going to get married. Well, maybe they are. Well, as soon as J. Low and Ben F. like Tyden, I'll throw a third thing about it next year. I mean, not that it makes a difference. She's still got no talent. Her show blows. She's got those ridiculous pastel backgrounds that are, well, I don't know what that's supposed to prove. And she's got all these women, millions and millions and millions of American women. All she has to say fart. And they're all like a sitting on one cheek. Man, oh, you go by this book. Oh, by the. I mean, yeah, I'm going to show we recommend you good movies because, you know, but it, but it's not like some kind of a scam we got going. Doesn't matter. Perfect. Look how stupid we are. Let's get smart. Right. Oh, bro. Yeah. Like Hollywood video or something. Right. And so right. Let's start our own guy to end video club on here. Let's start stealing a bunch of DVDs or making bogus copies and selling on the internet. Oh, and by the way, it missed the flood. Careful. Far be it. Far be it from me to just leave anything I'd read on the internet. Wow. Talk about the podcast on the kettle. Pick, Matt. Oh, do you see those cool joints just do they died? Those are Iranian sisters they died. It's my fault. And they keep showing them on here again. Again. We knew the wrist was great. Yeah. Well, it was so great they died. I know you're not supposed to make fun of things like that. I'm not making. I'm not talking about them dying. I'm not like for relearned. I think when people die, it's sad. Usually, although if the Katherine Heresther would have been too well, but I mean, you know, there are a lot of things to think about when you have signed these twins like that. I mean, how do they go to the toilet? Don't go stealing my tomorrow's show. No, I think that's a good show for you tomorrow. That would be a good poll. That's what I'm going to do. Which things would be the most difficult for signed these twins to do? Have sex? Go to the toilet? Um, right on a bus? Right, right a bicycle? Drive a car? Uh, be a game show contestant? You see what I'm saying? Pitch for the marlins. That would be something. That would really be something when you have two balls coming at you at the same time. That's what most said. Absolutely. Well, you know those, the original sign means twins. The, the Chang and Ang brothers. They both between the two of them fathered like 20 kids or something. Really? And they married twin girls. They had in the Toronto Star yesterday in the front page. There were two, um, Asian. I'm not not Chinese, but they were like, I don't know where they were from. Pakistan or summer. And, uh, kids that were like separated. Not, I get get shortly after birth. And they, you know, they were fine. I mean, no, they weren't after birth. They almost the, I guess. But they, they look fine, you know. They're like 18 now and even separated for years. And that their surgery went okay. Unlike these poor Iranian sisters who died. And they were like, you know, they were like, you know, the same twins, but they were otherwise attractive. Facially speaking. What do you mean by that? Would you still do them? Oh, you mean if they were still connected? Yeah. Or just imagine you could do one with each hand. Huh? That's something to think about. Now does that count as a three, some or what? What was that that they said during the revolution, one if by hand and one if by mouth? And if you see, that's what Paul reveres said. Something like that. Five, six, seven, five, six, five, six, five, six, six, six, six. There's another good question for you. Would you have sex with the time these twins? Well, my pole was going to be tomorrow. Yeah, I'm sure another one of these filthy disgusting, breakdown. Yeah. Yeah. I still wonder about that. I know it's, it's, but I mean, you got to go. You got to go. Right? What would the plan be? How about, how about if one of them has to go? And the other one doesn't. I guess you don't have a choice, you know? Just come in and sit down or read a magazine while I'm taking care of Venice, right? Maybe that you, if they had side by side toilets, they could get on the same schedule. Don't forget I'm in Canada side by each. Oh, sorry. Here's a call from Key Largo. Hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Good afternoon, user. God, you sound so happy up there. I am. Yeah. I feel like I'm in paradise. You are in paradise. How did we have Belki's in the Ray? Spilki's in the Ray, you think his gay? Rams with the Ray. Well, I hope so. Really? Okay. Well, let's put around there just to make you happy. It sounds like you're going to get a real charge out of it. Okay. Thank you. I am having a great day. Plus, put Spilki's in the Ray on there. Any show we can take at that bitch, we're delighted to do on this show. Pretty exciting. The NBC called to inform us that the Catherine Harris dying in a plane crash story was bogus. It was an internet hoax. And then the rest of that story is they wanted to take a clip of us talking about it to use on their news. Really? Why would they want to do that? I don't know. Tough came in and asked. Then I said no. Right. Right. Why do we want to do that? To try to make us look like that. Hey, I mean, I said right out front that we were really dubious and trying to find the website and the whole thing. But it was just, you know, it was a possibility. And I checked out the Sun Sentinel and they heard it. It's not like it just came over to fact. And I went on here and boom, here it is. We checked it out for a few seconds. But, put it right on here. Why don't I? That's a good enough for Fox to go back to it's good enough for us. It fact just make up a bunch of stuff and facts into us and we'll read it on the air. Why not get an I need share. Hey, why do I speak in with that? We, I think we all owe a collective of a dedicated gratitude. Even though he's been ever very short time to Scott. Even though some people find him abrasive, and some people find him to be a little invasive and uptruth, whatever. But I, I think he's, uh, a little firearm to this place. You know, long overdue. This radio station has been stagnating. since Greg Reid decided to fitly fart around with our morning show. We've been having problems. And then we decided to stick this show from 9 to 1 and 10 to 10 to 2. That was like the last nail in our coffin. He just about buried. And then after that, when he put somebody on the air, in a morning of precedus, who was encouraging his audience, not to listen to us, because he's a humeral soul fart. That was like the last thing. It was like closing up the box. So now we got a guy in there who's like, you're created some excitement. And you can feel it. You can smell them, speaking of feeling and smelling it. The little, you know, before the show every morning, when Feral is on, he comes in our studio during the commercial breaks. And he and I have a little verbal inner course, little chat as to what's going on. And he was pointing out to me this one. Now this is a guy that's only been there for six to seven weeks. Keep that in mind. But even he's been there long enough to see the difference in the atmosphere and the building and the hallway, the morale among the troops. As to when certain somebody is there and like now when he's not there. That's a loop. The difference when everybody's in a great mood and they're like, a high five in each other and playing grab ass and all these other things. He went on for a long time about that. So I just mentioned that in passing. Okay. I think we've been given a new leash on life. Thanks, Scott. You're okay. And by the way, we ain't getting no breakfast. Hillary Clinton, what's in these female celebrities do most strongly believe is a dyke. And we ever get Oprah on there right away. Yes, she's on her. She'll have any votes. Yeah, she will. 459 votes. Hillary Clinton 170. Jody Foster 127. And she's slowly but surely he's closing in on her ass. Oh my god, what a thought. I don't think she's got any. Yes, does she, Hillary? Oh, day one. No, no, I don't. Do you think? Remember that's when that beach, those beach videos of him and her walk in hand. Like I said, she's all last. And 3170, Jody Foster 127, Jamie Lee Curtis 38, did I mention who's a father? Who's daughter? Jeannie, it's an ingeraphylo 16. She's moving up fast. I don't, I don't pay that much attention to who she's doing. Mariah Carey 15 and Colbert 14 and Aquarnahoia 14. Brittany Spears 12, Sigourney Weiner, A Weiner 12, J. L. 12, Janet's Jackson's got eight. Kathy Bates 6, Christy make pickle five. That's good. The Christie still got some votes because most people probably forgot about her. Now, what was the show that she was on with she on family? Yes. With what's his name? Gary Pucket. Dornhofer. What, whatever the hell his name was? You know what I'm talking about? Gary Franks. Okay, I never watched family. And the mother was David Thompson and the father was James somebody who died a couple of years ago. James, uh, somebody. James I'm dead. Well, what a memory, huh? That was really a corny show. I did like Gary Frank though. 200 reason I watched it. Kathy Bates 6, Christy make pickle five. Nicole Kidman 4, Brittany Houston 3, Helen's hunt 2 and that's it. A whole bunch of people with no votes yet. Get with it folks. Daisy Fuente is Linda Evans, Melissa Rivers downtown Julie Brown. Elizabeth Xu. These people have no votes. Also also with no votes are Linda who else? Charter. Oh, somebody must have just a got one in there. Oh, yeah. No, I'm a police amorees. Got one Queen Latifatoo and the Oprah's got one now. Finally, that's going Oprah. That was kind of a giveaway when she said the wealthiest, biggest Oprah, no talent bitch. That was kind of a dead giveaway, you know what? God, I just, you know, more power to or I guess, but there's just something about her attitude that I don't like. She's like, uh, not it's like her stuffed-owns thing, you know what I mean? Instead of being like a little bit humble and saying she have made billions of dollars and I have no talent and I have no idea what I'm talking about. And it, uh, kissed the ground for it. No, she asked like, uh, she's going to say the, remember when she came to Miami that time? Oh, yeah. Several years ago and she was, she came to Miami to help us fight the crime way and she was going to have that show and that was going to do it. It did, didn't it? I think so. Have you heard anybody die since then? No, I don't think so. No more crime. No more shooting, no more crime, no more dying. Although a little of Anne every time they see her show on here, they all screened. And boom, we didn't look at you. You notice we didn't have one call about that movie. We don't have any specs anymore. And I think you chased them all away. Sorry, this is kisses for everyone. I never heard of them. In fact, be in a boy. Are you still putting stories on or not? I sure hope not. There's, there's, there's two, but they were already on yesterday. Oh, and I was wondering whether I should put them on again. No, not again, my bad. All right. But the, please don't be a favor. And do a search for kisses for everyone. It's a 2000 movie. I'm sure it'll be in there. Oh, look at this. Holy crap, just happened to catch you and heard you talking about Wachovia is a time the switch to your buddy Matt. My core shop at City National Bay. You bet your Matt. Here's the answer to my problems to my prayers. Although my probably lost a little bit more here, but nevertheless, what a great guy he is. This is City National Bank of Florida. Matt is the vice president and branch manager. What does it say? 8825 North Power Line Road for Lauderdale. Now where the hell is that? I mean, I know where power line is, but I like, I kind of, kind of in that direction, see. We're appointing that way. Is it? Right. You mean up the road of peace? Yeah. No, seriously, where the hell is, uh, would that be? I don't know. 6825 North Power Line Road. That's not way up there like by Pompano Park, is it? Might be. See, let me tell you this. I wouldn't really care where it was because with him, I could probably do it by me, you know what I'm saying? I could like FedEx him, my, it's the positive, anything. Right. What would you say in? I'm, I'm keeping this. I'm switching to my buddy because this guy took care of me. I can't, I've got a female right there. You can call him. You can email him. I will. I'll do it. Thanks, Matt. I'll be in touch. I'll be touching it. What is it that you wanted to know about kisses for everyone? Vessel Spatutalos. Are you a start in the speak by? White House officials say that the president of Lauderdale is he? Lino Sanquista, Spencer. Bam, Ramon, look at that. Look at that. He's a river. I have a shrimp. It's a local. I don't know. I know that the effort is coming up in there pretty soon. I don't know what that word is in Spanish and don't say it. But I know what's on there because I was reading the subtitles. I'll say it. Don't say it. See you. I'm just kidding. I'm not really. I'm not a chow. I have a dinner with a girl. Got anyway. Now what's the story where it was it made? Who was in it? What's it? It's a good movie. What does it say? 2000. Yeah. I already told you that. What was it? Speaks. Yeah. Taints in the abuse past. This film goes astray is the user commented I could be from here the first one. Let me look in my book. I bet you that it might in this book is like six billion pages. Why am I asking you? Why am I asking a little quizzling like you? Who did not even reading me the cast members, which is your people, man? No, that's right. I forgot. They're not Mexicans. Emma Fawade. Eloj's in the dark. Kisses for my president. It's not in here. Now why would that be? Kisses in the dark. You want to know why it's not because it's not in American made movie. It was made in Espania, I do believe. Look under Basos. I beg your pardon. Look under Basos, B.E.S. O.S. Maybe I know. I know how to spell Basos. What is wrong with you, man? Is they saying it lead Basin a Multo? Let's see. Look under Basos. I have a Paceos. It says that's what the Bina board gets paid in every week. Paceos. How many? But third man. It's not under Basos. Okay, you jackass. Why would it be under Basos? Oh, guess what will we have bought? I haven't watched it yet. The last night. I give up. That's the best in show. Oh. Did you tell me how much I wouldn't enjoy that? Not me. Making fun of all those investments to account for people. It looks like it's a real hoot from there. Now here. Let's see. How about Hillary Swank or Skanks? Is this a facts from Pete and Boeton? Who's Hillary Swank? Boys don't cry. Didn't see it. Did I see that? Karate Kid. Three. Oh, Hillary Swank. I know who that is. You think that's a digest because she dressed up like a boy? I don't. Whatever. I see that. Sure. Whatever. Put her on. You're Hillary Swank. She's okay. By the way, Pete says, thank you for the information. Bank Atlantic blows. I just had the same exact situation you had this weekend with. And I had my paycheck wired on a Wednesday. Roach extra were cashed on the following Monday. And back in line of claim that was overdrawn because it takes them five. You know, something five business days for the wire to clear across me. 60 bucks. They do have excellent service for the bank charges or through the roof. If you want to check your balance at an ATM, even there's a close to buck and a half. And if you want to withdraw money, another buck and a half after while these charges pile up, I just got back this morning from closing my account with them. I use under the mattress banking now and they're great. And now Pete also says, get for real off the air. Brupply attend on the dot. I like them a lot but two hours is more than enough. Wow, if you can get him to shut off, but you're lucky. And I have paid. Chagan. Well, listen to me. I mentioned this new before the show. I'm not one of those, you know, this crusading on a radio. I gave that up for a win, you know, a long time ago. But many, many years ago, when I was on WNWS, WS news at night, talking to 90 world people, we did accomplish one thing. And I think it was back when BDI Bobby Graham was in the Senate at that time. I mean, I mean, I went it not to, he's in the Senate now, dummy. It went. He was the governor. And thanks to him and some people in the Florida legislature, we brought it to their attention. This scam that's been going on a back in those days. They used to hold out a town checks. All of the banks in South Florida. They're in the state. They used to hold them for like, I don't know, two weeks or some ridiculous amount like that. And checks that were like in town for five to seven days. Well, come to find out that because it's all done electronically. And keep in mind, this was years ago that we did this. They forced them to write a law. But even that law is not restrictive enough. We find out that almost every local check, clears within what all of them do within one day. And some of them the same day that you deposit it, local banks. Because it's done electronically. And out of town checks, two to three days tops, tops. Even if you deposit it from a bank in LA, two to three days tops, for a degree, because it's all done electronically. So I think what we need to do is get somebody on a ball with this and cut this crap, because this is one of the biggest scams in America. How would you like to be in a business where you have a whole bunch of people handing you their money to hold for them? But before you let them use it, you hang on to which for several days, and you're making money on it. You're earning interest on it. Which is exactly what they do. It's one of their biggest money makers, one of the biggest scams that the banks have going. There shouldn't be any hold. Maybe a day. Okay? Maybe a day if it's not like a long time customer that they know is dependable that it doesn't bounce checks. You should have a status. Well, that's what I had until God damn in the first union. While Kovia came along, they should only croak. They suck. And their attitude sucks. I understand there's seven hundred other angry people in line or front of me, but I'll be God damned. If so, like you said, if you're a schlepper like you, and you're trying to like juggle and rub from Peter to PayPal and citing checks and doing whatever which happens. This happened to all of us in our life. I understand that. But when you're somebody like me who's making some serious bucks, I don't bounce checks. What would you think if that check that I gave you for Beater Boy's computer? What would you think of, oh, sorry Mr. Rodriguez, but the checks no good it came back. Yeah, dead beetle. Dead beetle. What's wrong with you with a money you're making? Can you piece of crap? You pathetic. No, seriously, you'd be pissed off. I would be all right. I'd be funny. It would be funny coming from you. Somebody else had freak out. Yeah, coming from me, my ass. Okay. Coming from me. If you already spent that money, if you already written a checks on or something, you wouldn't think it was so goddamn funny sweetheart. No, but not a problem right now. How do you know? Check your balance lately? Yeah. Five-suit after actually the story probably run a phone immediately. Oh my God. That's what I thought this weekend. Put my goddamn card in an ATM. Uh! Who the hell are you kidding? How you dumb American? You're not getting okay. It's for us even that cheap Canadian currency. Speaking of that, how's the market doing today? Doing a dude doing a dude doing a dut to Well yesterday? Look at it going, no yesterday went way up. I'm sorry, don't ask anybody why they don't know. Oh look at that. Next up, another 9. The down is down only 23. This is all, you just wait. That's my prediction. I'm not getting involved. If you want to win a vest day, have a good time doing it. Okay, you live a better time in Vegas and have more money left over. Now here's the call for Miami online you just know there is no question here's Miami hello hello me. Yes sir. Hey how are you? Pretty good. It's Saudi House. I was wondering to recommend to you a movie I'm not. I didn't see it in your list. Do you ever see American beauty? American beauty. American beauty. I think Jordan knows about it. We talked about it very good movie. I haven't got it yet. I was very surprised. It totally surprised by the outcome. Let me check it out you know like it. Okay. Alright now thank you. Thanks a lot. American beauty. It certainly is no big low-wensky but I'll give it a shot. Kevin Spacey and that bending door of birch. Right. Some other guy. Mm-hmm. Nothing wrong with it. I was surprised. Everybody touted it. Every time they tout a movie I'm dubious. I'm gonna tell you one thing. I'm not my good friend Miguel. It's a damn good thing he looks like good. I haven't heard of that before because he's got so many deficiencies. He's just, I don't know what the problem is. There may be a bandage up the ball to own up to it. Lesser man would have said oh yeah great movie whatever. No he wouldn't. Somebody else would have knowing that they would have gotten ripped. Oh he hasn't carries these to the fight now. Sure. As long as we don't sick the rean on his ass. Hillary Clinton won 75. The majority foster 140 and that's a tourist race. Everybody else is sucking windman. They're way, way behind. Out of 505 votes into tourist race. It's secretariat and they will not say it. It's a firm and alitar coming down the stretch. It's Sunday silence and easy go or coming down the stretch together. I'll tell you one thing before you notice going to be Kentucky Gerby Day in May again. Dave Johnson will be on the phone with us. It's just how these years just keep flying by. Yep. Fly and by. Before you know it I'll be 90 just like Ma. You think Ma's going to send me a birthday card of my 90s birthday? Surely be 120. Maybe she's writing a bunch of letters in advance. How do you like that? You pick out a reanized card. You sign it ahead of time. I put it out put a nice $1,000 check in their happy birthday. And can you believe it? You made an idea nice cute little note. I have it as a John who goes over there by the way. I do you don't know this. He goes over there to take my place every week and have lunch with her. To show you what a good sport he is. What a good sense of humor he's got. Yeah. I don't want to send it a number of times he said reenact will push that from those millies ground browns. Okay. I don't want to tell you that. Good God. So I give it to him and here's the check. Take it over there. He takes her his own card here. Happy birthday. Would you of course his card don't have no check. But there you go. And all I get is because he hasn't been there yet see. Because I call her bright and early Saturday morning. Say happy birthday Ma. And what do I get? Yeah. The only one hasn't sent me a card yet. I got one for your brother. Yeah. Was there a check in a card from my brother? Which I don't want to mention. Just a clear bankruptcy for the 85th time. Not not 85. But he's got a scam going. It's called life. I'd like to do that. Okay. I have no idea how that works. How many times can you declare bankruptcy? But certainly. But anyway. I hope she enjoyed his gift of dates and candy and crap that's going to like it. They probably prevent her from making it to 91. He must think she's got a lot of money stashed away somewhere. Because every year he sends her all of this candy and crap. You know, she's got a lot of money. You're much more likely to kill her. Doesn't work though. It hasn't worked yet. Has it worked yet? She's still alive. 1257 at 5. 60. WQAM.

Peter and KFC in Game of Chicken. An animal rights group said it plans to file a lawsuit. This was yesterday against fast food chain KFC. Accusing the company of making misleading statements on its website regarding how the chickens itself are treated. There's nothing worse than misleading statements on the internet. You know that? Right. That's what the misdragy said. People for the ethical treatment of animals. Peter said it will file suit and California State Courts. I guess they did yesterday against KFC and its parent. Young brands incorporated. Young. Young. Rimes with dumb. Sicking and injunctions. The stoppeter says are deceptive statements on a KFC website. Peter contends that. Patah contends that chickens KFC buys some suppliers are abused through drugging feeding and slaughter practices. The director of vegan outreach of. Patah. Bruce Friedrich said the treatment is legal but they can't legally lie about it and they have been. They've been lying about it. Through their teeth. Friedrich alleged KFC's website other public communications contain misstatements about how the chickens are treated. The claims on a website are transparently absurd. He said we tried writing letters to explain to them on their what is on their website is lackably. Obviously wrong and they've ignored us. Sposed people for KFC and young could not be reached for common. They're probably hanging out with a kernel. Peter. And a draft of the plan lawsuit obtained by rotors takes issue with the KFC's.

The local people are pretty much in charge, and it still has the atmosphere with small town bank. Right. And they're fantastic, and they're very easy to don the internet. So I bank on why now. Yeah. And I really recommend that now two things. So the only water bill office that I know or borrowed office that I know of, the sort of cost from the Broward County Courthouse, and that child building. Oh, God. Yeah. But I don't know. Maybe they have one out west now. And the other thing is that it, yes, it is from the million family from Pittsburgh. Not for me, then. Not for me, David. David. Yeah, not for me. I'm some Pittsburgh that I, you know. Anyway, also, what you put to Andrew Bowley, you think Sandra Bullock is a dyke? Oh, yeah. He's positive. Look at her last movie. Just look at her. What was your last movie? God. Two weeks notice. I didn't see that. Would you grant? Okay. I'll be through the rumors about them having a round hands with David. And I'm, well, I'm just sure of it. Well, we got it down. Okay, thanks. Thanks, lad. I have a great day. Bye. Get Sandra Bullock on her voice. She's taken a beating on our polls the last couple of weeks. That's okay. I think she's cute. Yes, she is. And quite frankly, I don't care whether she's a dyke or I shouldn't know a fact like me. I care what is she, I mean, what difference is a make anyway? Well, we think we're not going to get to know any of these people. What difference is a make? We're not going to do them anyway. Right. Like Matt Damon. Am I going to meet Matt Damon? Am I going to like touch? No, of course not. You know, I mean, he's pretty good. I'll tell you, born identity. You'd be really proud to say, boy, Matt, you really pushed up a lot. I wrote it down. Yeah, you like the movie. Trust me. I bet. Be your boy's life on it. In fact, I'll bet everybody's life. If it isn't more interesting than a goddamn horrible, horrible movie that you forced me, and it was mostly being a boy. Oh, this is really great. A beautiful mind. Even though they had beautiful minds. I should have kept looking for the wrong name, at least then I wouldn't have found it. A beautiful mind with Russell Crowe. Boy, you ought to be eating Crow right now. Mr. Attitude that. Because that's for the birds that movie it sucks. I stand by. When does it give good at what point? I mean, be side of fact, he's drinking. And figuring about much in numbers, and he's kind of like a social misfit beside that what what happened. It's all foundation. You have to watch it. Oh, and now you know what you think it is. You've got to get that off right when it was about to get good. Ha ha ha ha. Right. Yeah. Yeah, you probably left just about when it was ready to get the bird. See what you don't know yet watching that movie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And what I heard was I coming out. I had a crazy divide and then to watch it. I know I was crazy. But it was based on a real guide on some mathematics. You still live and teach and class up in the wherever it is. Berkeley or something. Yeah. Wow. It's crazy. I bet you're sure gold farms a lot more entertaining than ever been. I thought of the old. Thank you. Yeah. I got like a little. Twins. Yeah. Yeah. I'd go in when I had a chance. Yeah. I'm not going to. See that movie is much too cerebral from a girl. Well, with all the respect. I mean he's a wonderful guy. He looks great. He does a good job for us. But he's a dumb. You know. You know what I mean? I don't mean like he's articulating. You can speak English. He's peeking at a pony. But he's, you know, you know what I'm saying? Well, no, it's just that stuff's not done yet. Come on. Like I said, he's probably the smartest pick I've ever met my life with the accepted prison company. I don't want to show you. So anyway, this plaques from Matt Corchoff at City National Bank of Florida. This is like a, seeing it. See, and it's a damn good thing I come on here and bitched about it. Because that's how I met Matt in the first place. Although he always turned me down. No, but seriously, that's how I got with family bank at a first place. Remember I was bitching about Haitians and I mean, nations bank? Yes. And look what happened to that. They went out of business. Anybody see nations bank lately? They got brought out by some other fakeers. Probably by first union or somebody. I think it was. So it'll be mess it with me with my banking because I'll put your ass out of God damn business of it. The last thing I do when you start dealing with my mind is I told this woman on the phone and on whatever the yesterday. I said we're not talking about a supermarket. We're not talking about a God damn hat store. We're talking about people's money. And you people just keep making two goddamn many mistakes. It's unacceptable. She's got this cavalior god damn attitude. But while kind of like they'll do me the favor if they feel like it. And if not, then they won't do it. Like they're doing me a big favor. Right. You can't you can't extend the privilege to a customer and then all of a sudden say, oh, oh, we're not going to do that for anymore. We changed their mind. You see what I'm saying? You can't expect to keep customers by doing that. It would be like us saying, well, you know, we used to do a pretty entertaining show for the audience out there. But we're not going to do that anymore. We're going to play like Beethoven for hours every day. Let's give it a shot. Or let's just play. Play that all day every day. I like that a lot. Don't forget we got the marlins in the cup that don't go running away because we got a ball game coming up. Okay, no, lot of you like to play that game because you want like, but the way to Marlins have been playing lately and we got Don Trell, Darnell, whatever his name is. What is his name? Don Trell will us. The talk of America. He's going to be pitching against the occubbs and work with me. If you'll 1-45, the pre game and the game at 2-20 this afternoon with Harry Curry and Steve Stone. You know, is there any more? Don't let me forget on Thursday because it's a long way off and you get to be this old. Who knows if I'm going to make it, but when Thursday when I do the crossover with Ferrell, I want to ask him because I know he won't be Es me. Is there a more boring baseball and out-so-than-day van boring on a marlin seat? That's one of the problems. That's one of the reasons I have nobody out there is because there's nobody to whip up any enthusiasm. I say, let's get Ferrell to do the play by playing next year. Oh, you're going to say he's looking for us the next for money. Yeah. I mean, he can do the panthers. He can do the freaking marlins. Look at that. That's an effort home run. I can just hear it now. Probably you can't hear the lessons in this middle of the second inning. But it'll be great. Now get some people out there just like Harry Curry got us all to be company. That's what a like Bob Prince made all the people pirate fans like Rick Weaver with is a white hanky's. And his mother's in his bed at Roma. Too bad we got what we got now. Popped Janko.

Wouldn't this be fun? They're all in line. Hey. It feels not there today. And they're all like I said who wants to hear that. No, remember he told us he's only working like somebody days away. No, sorry. Let's water for the cold man. We love your husband. Hey. I hope in Taney push. Thank you. That has to be safe. We don't mind you see our jobs go. We're passing the night by Kano. Don't need no stupid. Oh. All the hours we've seen. The fact that's a marriage in the way. Everybody's turning five. Yes. I ask you a day. Oh, I'm speaking of the American accent. The way the shootings in Mississippi today. And we're ready. And how about the near shootings? The near Columbine repeat that we had yesterday in Jersey. Yeah. Almost almost. It came within a kicky little hair. That close. Having another mass shooting in a school. I'm going to know is where else they were going to be shooting up a bunch of people. Crazy people with guns, man. Got a whole bunch of facts is here. Here's what it says to went in Salt and to interview a few deposit cash in your account. And watch over your money after 2 p.m. And Broward 4 p.m. And they've the money doesn't post immediately in your account. What kind of crap is that? They suck. Yeah, I've heard that. They can make a cash deposit. They still put it on ahold of the next day. Even though the money is in there. Maybe they're afraid the money's going to bounce. There you go. They don't know what money came from. And it's right. Now, somebody faxes me a poll that we took. What's moving at the most shocking ending. And American beauty was on this is. Remember this? Yeah. I think it's in the well on the poll. Is that it? Yeah. I see. I still haven't seen you. But I will. Don't get push. I could. I must have watched the whole bunch of. Weaker so including that black cat with Bella Gosey and. And Boris Carlah. And more of the worlds again, which was sensational. Everybody should be forced to see that. All that religious bullcraft. Although, of course, in the end, you know, they have to. They have to redeem themselves because that was back in 53, you know. Right. And of course, they were in the church. And they were all praying. And all of a sudden, I don't want to run the ending for it. But everything turned out okay. Well, except for the people who are already zapped away, you know. So anyway, American beauty, I'll get it. I'll get it today just to calm you people down a little bit. Now, here's one, every year. I mean, look, it's a matter of opinion, like George and Vina Boy both liked a lot. A beautiful mind. To me, it was the biggest waste of time. I could have been picking Dingo berries out of most but. Okay. And probably had a more enjoyable time than watching that. It was just it just, it was slow. It was not no more. It didn't go anywhere. Although, that's something to think about on the station. No, a lot of movies are like that. That's the foundation building. To pay a lot. To a long it too long. You know, it's like too much for play. Some of it is okay. But about 20 hours of it might be a little bit too much. Your attention span can't be shorter than mine. Here's one. I saw Magnolia the other night on your recommendation. It's as awful. Just depressing. Yeah, that's one of the electronic facts. I see. When you know what, it's the best thing we'll be able to ever see. We'll give him like it or not. Talk to you. Okay. I mean, how many movies are uplifting? Right? A lot. Usually movies that are uplifting are corny movies. You know, like Jimmy Stewart would call it's a wonderful life. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. That kind of, well, I'm just down here. Those are the uplifting movies. I mean, yeah. Breakfast and food for dream was that uplifting? No, first time it would be pressing. This movie is so portally made that there are no words to describe it. In fact, you don't want to give it his proper due indicates to me. You're going to fuck up. We're asked about something. Oh, I should have put that on the pole yesterday. You know, that's right about Magnolia. George is a bug up his ass. He's got Magnolia's up up. He's a bug. What would you rather have up your ass folks? Lilature Magnoges. Puzzles. Come. That's such a phenomenal movie. I don't see I shouldn't have played that because every time I played, I started thinking about that scene again. It just, it just emases me. Every character in a movie is just so, I mean, you know, most movies there are characters that like that thing we did with a godfather, you know? We had 100 characters on there. And you could think about any of them. And like if they were near fine, if not the big deal, a small potatoes. You know, like Frankie Ben Tangely. Small potatoes. Or you know that Al Pacino went to the, what, at least Ross is acting school in the Yorkers where he got a start. No, I didn't know that because his bio was on biography last night. Al Pacino. And that's why he personally interceded. That was the first time he's Ross, it was ever in a movie. Did you know that? No, I did not. There you go. Now you got two pieces of news for you. Did you know that the Katherine Harris is dead? Oh, no, that's why she's not. But we can't be perfect. And Lee Straser, he went to him and he got him that part and got father too. I did just all of these things, just a wealth of knowledge with all the stuff that I'm seeing these days. Just tons of crap. I think that's. Pull question, which of these female celebrities do you most strongly believe is a Dijk. It's Dijk Tuesday. So everybody get ready to stick your finger like they do in Holland. Stick your finger in the Dijk. Come on. We're trying 180, 180, four, 180, four for Harry. She's still got a solid lead, but Jodie Foster's creep in creep at Evercloser 151. She's going to make a two-hospirase out of it. And they still got a 60-thomather. Yeah, I was going to put Phil Salsman on there and Phil's not working today because it's Tuesday. Never on a Tuesday.

Everybody that she's ever been associated with when I was supposedly married to was a fruit cake. Okay, is there a message here? Is there a consistent pattern? Jelo only 12. Brittany Spears 12. Kathy Bates 11. Chris, we'll see they probably figured what a big ass like that. What a waste it would be with Jelo. You know, what a dice going to do with a big ass like that. I know. Asked to ask.

Linda Evans, Melissa Rivers and downtown Julie Brown. Elizabeth the shoe and char day. They have none out of 561 votes. How do you like that? Beiner boy 561 votes. No bad. You just aren't the same today. Now we're going to hear about what your problem was this morning. Get it. Like white to slate clean. I got pulled over and you got pulled over again. Because they had to switch my rent of car. That's the switch my rent of car. My god. Apparently they didn't switch over the tag. And they were like, I was in the back of the car again. They were hanging in a prize and nobody in the prize was telling them anything. And finally they said, oh yeah, we thought they got a car. They switched the car with his previous way of showing. Like the spank. So. This man is not allowed to leave the building. Let's build him. We can find someplace in like in a kitchen. But there's a 20 second floor. He can tell.

Because allowing you on the outside is dangerous. You're laughing. I'm like, this is a man who cannot be allowed to drive to walk. Like to be on the loose. Man. Anyway. I still love that movie. Okay. Come on. Anybody says to me, the press. Do bad. Hey, we're not. I need to be more entertaining. And maybe that's what they did the press about. Come on. And I just love evening man. Okay. Okay. What anybody says. I love evening. Hey, you've been arguing with me about that. No, I've been a Amy Man fan for a long time. Paul Thomas Anderson is a freaking genius. Okay. This man is a genius. Anybody who could have ate that movie. And done all of these things. And Jason Robars like I told you, just basically died on the screen. Pretty damn close to it. He died right there on a freaking screen. See, Jason. What a great actor he was. Jason Robars is dead. But he hack it is dead. Katherine here. I'm sorry. But he upset his dead. Katherine. Katherine. Katherine is dead. Katherine here. He burned. He's the. That's what I was. Hey, miss. It was Katherine. And they were thinking about Katherine with an age. Is that to it? No. Oh. But it's just just like you folks. You don't agree with me that that's the best TV team of all time. You're wrong. Look at that. You won't believe this. You've never got to believe this in a million years. What? Where I'm sitting here in my studio out on a window. There's like a little patio. Enter these cheesy like. Chairs. You know, the kind of like patio chairs. It just kept over the window. Just I may didn't go over the edge of the can't do that. But it just it just kept over. I guess that's got to be paying me for that Katherine Harris story. Oh, we apologize profusely. No. We're so sorry that we got sucked in. Why we didn't really get sucked in. We just added and we kind of like debated is this for we're going to not. And why not let you know just in case. And it got us on the Dredreport, which has seen by how many Biden people every day. There you go. Thanks a lot, miss. Fudge. She's packing it. We got the ball game coming up. 131 at 560 WC. It's coming up at 145 with a pregame from Rickley Field with Dave and boring.

Whatever I did wrong. Hey, it wouldn't be the first mistake today, Lynn. Made a bad mistake on that Catherine Harris story. And are we upset about that? No. We got some nice coverage on your boyfriend's website. Billions and billions of people all over the world. More people than our live yet today are seeing it. But third of me! And we put it on that she was dead while she was right there on Seaspan on Deviant. Of course, what was our first call? First cover out of the box. Got it was watching on Seaspan at their intellectual audience for you. Can't pull it all over this audience's eyes. I'll even do it. We'll give it to you for a long time. Here's for a lot of day. Hello. Yeah, you doing Neil. Pretty good, sir. That's still Magnolia. I didn't think that was all that great of a movie. This is Reverend Jones. Yeah, Reverend Jones. Yeah. Here's Del Rey Beach, hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. Yeah. My second share and stuff. Sure and story is a die. Yeah, well, you know, I'll need as much fish as every time you see it. So what does that tell you? But I got a couple of things. I work at a lab in Palm Beach County and that's it. You could make super balls at a sub. You do some kill at with a hammer. Right. That's unbelievable. I got a funny story for you. I've been talking to Hacca yesterday and they wanted to know whether it's so black. I've been that scared. And I said because you'd have to put, uh, yeah, put sirens and gum on machines on the rest of the cars. Get them to drive fast. There you go. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Boy, he's your like this. Huh? I don't like it too. Yeah, again, that whole dusty baker thing about blacks and about the spikes and on and off. And here, here about a week and a half ago, the Toronto star had a big thing on her front page. Climb to blue jays, the white jays and they don't have enough blacks. They don't have the same percentage. I mean, let's cut the crap already. Okay. Can't we just get along? No, that would be no fun. Be no. Be no cook. Oh, God. Football season isn't that far away. And what is the one thing we dread about football season on WDQAM? Oh, look at that. Did he take the thing off of me? I think you're pardon me. Uh, miss, but she took my thing off there. I had the big headline. That looks like it's gone. Well, my, my, uh, 10 minutes of fame, sure, and last too long. Although, a lot of other stuff has changed on here too. Well, we had like a little flash on there. Just a little flash. 560, 50560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Live. What's that schedule look like? We got the ball game coming up.
