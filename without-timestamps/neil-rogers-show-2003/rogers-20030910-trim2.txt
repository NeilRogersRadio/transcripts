Some of it will be reinvested in a new game slow to a lot of resource woman Sheila Griffin said keep in mind Lottery's the biggest rip off the biggest legalized rip off an history mankind in my right One person's finding about the ticket my Hamid I see him hosting owner of Cole's food market in North Bay village Still got his cut as the vendor who sold the winning numbers the lottery paid him 10 grand I gave some to a friend of works with me and sent him to my wife in Bangladesh, Wisconsin The only problem is he might not be so happy if he checks with the hernphines out. She had a 50 million dollar ticket to light bitch. I mean It says if the ticket holder finally shows up And we'd have a five box of clean-ex Party because he or she would be crying.

They're obnoxious. They're dangerous. They're crazy people and This is what the problem is is that America takes it all too lightly see we're talking about religious extremists See this is the reason that the mainstream media because they're so afraid to lose sponsors and offend anybody That's why this whole thing would nine eleven. There's very little discussion about religious extremism except the course with Muslim extremists yeah, they'll be bad ones right there are the only bad ones and you recall that people like Billy Graham son Franklin Graham and all these others in the beginning were making these growth test as usual comments about Islam and all well That's really a violent religion and all that stuff. You know as opposed to Christianity and the other ones Which and Judaism which the Jewish god was telling like spite all of their enemies make sure they don't miss any. You know Religina sick. There's there's a thought of the pay double point. I mean you people at our brain washed and can't Mittally emancipate your brains from all the religious indoctrination and bullcraft.

Why do these little cries? Can 46, thank you Mr. President for those low gas prices. I can't get that punk out of my mind. I call that day. But the glorious, free-d-freeing of the Iraqi people and lowering of the gas prices, a bloody asshole man, what a bush liquor. Suicide bomber kills three people in Iraq as the carnage goes on. Other American soldier died this morning. Trying to get the little more information about that. It's just becoming so routine like murders in Miami that they don't even report much on any mole. You don't say that? Unless you catch the blurb on there real quick, you don't even know. Another US soldier dead. But this is a separate story. Suicide bomber exploded in an SUV outside the US intelligence headquarters killing three other Iraqis and wounding dozens, including four Americans. A Kurdish security official said today. The US military and Baghdad had said six Americans were wounded. Later said four intelligence officers were heard along with a Kurdish, a Kurdish, a Kurdish official who spoke on condition. I was thinking yesterday again. I could go off on a long rant. We don't have time today. But how is it possible that the public is so God damn stupid? Like the thing with a Taliban, all of those years went on. Nobody gave a flying figure about the Taliban about the women with a berkaz about the could not be seen. How repressive they were and about the Spartan existence that these people were forced to live on. Nobody cared until after 9. 11. Then all of a sudden we started seeing eight billions to every day. They were like another whole bunch of story. But the Taliban and the repression that the foisted on the poor Afghan people did. How many people in America really gave a flying crap about Afghanistan? Don't tell me about 30. We wouldn't like five. Even the Afghan hounds didn't have a map with both hands. And then all of a sudden here comes the Amir. I'm going to tell you right now the American media are the enablers. There were the ones when able Kenny Star and all of our wing Republicans do all that penis gate with Bill Clinton. There were the ones who made the whole big saw today and they made it possible for us to get as far as all an impeachment crap and waste millions of dollars of your tax money. And are the same ones who are letting this asshole off the hook? They're the same ones who are letting this asshole off the hook. Who just raised another three million bucks down there in Florida over the last couple days. Just gray shame on you as Michael Moore would say. But in this case I'm talking about the freaking American media. It's a pretty sad commentary when he takes to amy fate and to the true. The media is sick and he's not badly. A media sick and we need to help badly. That's the problem. Anyway, the answer all Islam organization with suspected times to be a kid was formally based near some place that I can't pronounce about 30 miles east of Erbil near the Iranian border. Answer headquarters was bombed by US just during the war. Surviving members of the group were thought to fled to Iran. They're now believed to have returned to Iraq. Which is now becoming a hotbed of terrorist activity. Which it wasn't before we started the Iraq attack. The operation Iraqi freedom. Right. How do you like them apples huh? I'm saying that again. Don't let me say that anymore. Don't say. You know what I get. We all do that. We get on for some of the right. Stiction in your mind. Don't let me do that no more. Okay. Because some things I may after well get to be irritating. Even though it might be too like I think I have herpes. Like most say an at this morning. I think I have herpes. How did that mo? That would be irritating. That would be. I think I have herpes. Firstly, your herpes on a scalp under his eyes. I think he had a scalp glued on to tight. That's why he was out yesterday. So he's got herpes under his hair. He had a peel it off. How is that pull coming? This is our first pull. We got the important one. This is just, you know, just for clarification. I think it's kind of interesting. You know, you know, like this pull? Of course I like this pull. Well, don't worry. I mean, crap. Nice. I'm like Scott there. See you trained in bed. You trained him so badly. Hey, Scott, pay attention to George. Uh, B.N. or boy was paying attention to George. Look what happened to him. So he wasn't. 226 votes so far. Which of these best describes why you listen to me around your show? For a liberal talk in a few laughs 84. I think I think that covers it, right? Sure. You're a little bit more god 65 for humor 48. There's nothing else on 10. For people who don't like Dr. Laura and Russian all the other crap that's on when we're on. But that's a good excuse. That's why I put it there. I love the crank callers nine. I'm a QM listener six pretty weak. Duff. And clearance pretty weak. You should be bringing us more to the table than that. If we had. Uh, we were like a talk station. I'm not talking sports talk. Are you like, I would be used to be. Right. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about that. I'm talking about that. If we wanted that, then we'd be siphoning a tremendous number of listeners from the other shows on a station. And we could get instead like a 10 or 11 sure. And then we could get. Right. But we're stuck with whatever we got. I hate Neil, but I can't turn it off for and I like Neil's pull, which Eric being very cute. spelled P.O.L.E. across the dot put P.O.L. Q.D.R.

It was a needle glove, but spray it. We made it. Very quiere. We made the piece. It surprised us. Um, how was it? It went through the door each long ago. That was gonna. Oh, this is gotta be on the pool. I will have to leave this up there to like 11 30 or something Do you want to know why I know what hi this is 75 I listen to you Rajas could I could hear the word asshole right? Because I like to hear the word asshole that Eric I hate to force you to pull one moron here. It's my bad Because here's the facts from Ralphie uses I listen to your show because I like to hear the word asshole So that's that's the other choice center because I like to hear the word asshole Speaking of which I saw God wearing a t-shirt that said my mother told me I could be anything I wanted to be I decided to be an asshole To which we say what's wrong with that? What's wrong with being an asshole? Anyway Getting back to this story about Howard sperm the federal communications commission ruled yesterday that Howard's Ranshee radio program is a bona fide news interview program This is was in response to request made by the New York based infinity broadcasting ink Which wanted to ruling that it's widely silicated steering show as a news program an exempt from equal time requirements for political candidates The decision will allow steering to put actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on the air without having to offer Equal time the discourse of other candidates running for governor in California citing an 84 decision that qualified the Donnihue talk show for news exemption and of course Don't you always think generally a Phil Donnihue and Howard Stern like in the same vein? Oh I'm doing difference being that Howard is still on the air The FCC said there should be room for less conventional interview formats to increase coverage of the political process Since the Donnihue decision other news interview programs are segments there are what unique and innovative format elements such as the Sally Jesse Raphael showed you're a springer and politically and correct with the umptious idiotic billmar and qualified for the news interview You know billmar is just a putts, you know I wouldn't even say he's an asshole. He's a puts He's just very he's ineffective. He's like a poor man's dick cavern Right I can't there he's just a wimpy little nerdy guy I know stupid that stupid book about if you ride alone you're riding with those somers I mean what a stupid bunch of crap, you know and then every Anna Huffington who lately's been writing some good stuff, but Now make what was the one that she wrote her she's had the same thing Something like that right some of some if you drive it as you be your terrorist something like that some similar kind of crap Can't stand billmar See pull up and then whole politically incorrect thing to people well, you know he's he's anti-establish man Big deal who cares? So for out the so's Ralph Nader what what he do for us so look what he helped us get look when he look on you people I voted for Nader in Shame on you man shame on you including Michael more as much as I love Michael more He voted for Nader and speaking of Donnihue. He not only voted for Nader He was a bang in the drums. He was the uh get the cheerleader It is pompoms out Remember that they do I mean, yeah, I'm not saying it Ralph Nader doesn't have some very good points But the pomp on the point is that what's the sense of throwing your vote away? So and it isn't that what I was screaming back then I was screaming and look what we got now You know Jacko look what we got you warned everybody. I warned you You vote for Nader and throw your vote away. It'll be close enough. They can like weasel this thing in there And they weasel their way in man. There's nothing worse than a goddamn weasel. That's what they did Snake this bunch of go ahead and then they're again the bush here mysters See this is supposed to be a democracy Not a goddamn monarchy and Between the kin of these and the Rockefellers and the bushes you see what it's all about Handful of very very dubious suspicious wealthy families who acquired their wealth most of them through a buy hook and mostly buy crook Just like joke Kennedy with his goddamn bootleg Anyway, how's Brian greasy's total in? Every time I hear that I think Is that Brian greasy? I don't know why I don't know oh maybe he's got it maybe spent a lot of time and answering And he belches a lot.

See, that's the second pool that Eric, when he like makes the shift on there. Yeah. That he changes the head or on here, if I can say that before he changes the, that's that's great. And I got sucked into it. I got sucked into it. The first pool is, well, which of these best describes why you listen to the Roger show. For level talk, how many last 116. Deal is the radio guide. 86, of course. For humor 61, I love the crank hauler's 13. There's nothing else on 11. I'm a QM listeners, 7. 2.3% pretty lame. I hate Neil, but I can't turn off six because I like to hear the word asshole 3. And I like Neil's pool only one. I thought that guy had a good suggestion, but nobody else did. Apparently what I'm saying. He's right to pull as an important part of the show, but that's not why they listen. And anyway, here's the second pool. Since it is such an important part of the show. I'll be the judge of W. Bush who is the most dangerous man in the world today. Now, here's my list so far, you can add to it, of course, as you want, or not as a case may be. Osala bin Laden Osama Yamala. Dick Taney. Donald Rumspelt. Moh Howard David. Neil Rogers. Kim Jong-Eel. Or Rush Limbaugh. I think that's a good list. Oh yeah. Huh? Covered. I don't think it's covered. I think there might be a few others on there, which is a good list. If you others on there, which I don't, I just mentioned because then people won't call in with them. Other than G.W. Bush who is the most dangerous, oh, oh, G.S. That's so obvious. God. The Pope. You know, how could I leave you a couple off of there, huh? The big potato. The Pope. A man, a silly old man, and a dress. God. All of a sudden, he's a really snappy dresser. And I should love that mitor and that schmata that he's got. Other than George W. Bush, the most dangerous man in the world today, or some of it, a modern Dick Cheney Donald Rumsfeld, Mohour David Neal Rajas, Kim Jong-Eel, Rush Limbo, or the Pope. The Pope was smoked the fat rope. 560560 pound, 560 on the AT&T. And Verizon Wireless Line. Now we've got some time to sit back and relax. Ah, take a whole bunch of really great calls between now and 1230. Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. Your next portion, D. Kim's question. What would the world be like if his BDI to ask whole of a brother hadn't been selected to the White House? That's a good suggestion. Now also, I have a opinion and a story. A news story. I disrespectfully disagree with your previous caller who said that the mentalist Christians were amusing. They are as dangerous and as big a threat to the freedom and the life in the United States as any other group of religious fundamentalists wackos in the world. Absolutely correct. The news story is from Alabama. Yeah. He talks about how the governor's request for a tax increase was rejected despite the fact that he told the voters of Alabama that it was their Christian duty to help the poor by shifting the burden of paying taxes more to the people who could afford paying taxes. And the comment in the paper was from a political expert in Alabama that students do believe, but they also vote their pocketbooks. So what does that tell you about who their God really is? And once again, Alabama leading the nation in EDSC. Well, don't forget, Joja. Yeah, well, as the SIPI as well. Did you listen to the Democratic debate last night? No, I did not. They had some good lines in there. One of the questioners asked the candidates what their favorite song was. Yeah. And Al Sharpton had the best answer. He said his favorite song was the theme song of the Republican Party. He was talking loud and saying nothing by James Brown. He took here a deal and you too. Hang in there, Paul. I have a great day. 560, 560, 560, the new pull is up by the way. New pull is up. We only got four votes on there. More Howard David moves into a quickly. That's bad. That's terrible.

What's the biggest state in the US? Alasha. No, I'm not talking about the insides you're graphic. I'm talking about impopulation. Yeah. So in other words, you don't think it says something about the US and where the public is going. But as movie actor is governor. I could bench for a hundred pounds asshole. Oh great. He can bench for a hundred assholes. There you go. He can bench for a hundred pounds. Well, in that case, what about the Jack LaLaine? He used to bench like for twenty. You didn't use Simmelton. What? Look. The right there. That was the by take back what I said before. That was the best call of the century right there. That was the reason I listened to this show. Plus I like the pace. It was the new criteria for president. I think. If I maybe could sit on these Supreme Courts someday because he's good on the bench. 560 5060 pound five sixty on the AT&T.

Almost diamond deals he had going ill Pat Robertson, all of his cooked friends over there in Africa I just mentioned that in passing also 560560 pound five 60 on a AT&T in Verizon line Here's for Latterdale, hello Hello Neil, yes sir First two things Okay, I have I have found somebody I want to throw your pole All right Generators the most dangerous man in the world, okay? Next second thing The second thing that Colbert had called in about Arnold's small attacker I don't think he's been 400 pounds in 10 years Okay, well that's a hell of a call man What? Hold this Woo! Wow Five by the way Eric, don't put Janet Reno on there It's just a little funny, guys trying a little a little lane humor 560560 There's no mention that is because anything you could mention Because Eric is being so efficient You've seen it happen, it just all of a sudden Topstrap there on a pole He's going to be picked on by the whole general I'll look at you soon, we'll have more much of them to poke Where are we going? Call Gables, hello Good morning, Neil Howard Yes sir, good morning to you I've got one for your pole Okay Richard Pearl Not Joyce Dr. Death When I see that fundamentalist I get I have to go under the bed Yeah, he's scary Oh, he sure is And if we put him on there we probably should put Paul Wolfowitz Ah well, yeah, they're connected to heaven I got raped over to Colbert by Ted Kennedy The other day was great It was beautiful to see that wasn't it? Yes, it was And you know I was I have another point But I was distracted by that 400 pound Arnold call Oh, yeah, beautiful You know the who the governor of the state is really isn't over all that important to the rest of us in the country Except for one thing Just like in Florida the governor gets to pick the secretary of state Who then picks the secretary of elections Like Catherine Harris Those types of characters And that is the importance of the governor Well, it isn't just that but the fact is that as again It's a tent by the right wing lunatic And these people wanted to subvert the will of the public And overturn and legal election Which is unusual in this country They have legal legitimate elections anymore And then that's what it's all about It has nothing to do with the grade Davis And so they prop up this you know somebody was Tramenus popularity because they know that all the pop stars Anybody who's a pop icon in this country for whatever reason is almost unbeatable And that is Arnold you know more on Well, the purpose of it is to get a hold of the electoral college boats of California Which has had that great in the afternoon And then it's going to happen Well, we'll see because you know we'll see Listen, I'll bet George and Scott's life on it right now And next year's election George W's got as much chance of winning your California as you've got to find a Ficc memory vacation you're back here at a lot of reticcate I agree with you, but it is part of their ongoing campaign that you were on That's true And but something that I did see this morning that was very disturbing That further confirms what you've been saying In my mind about the press being fully beholden to this president And their campaign As I was watching or listening to in the background that American morning show On CNN that has there in Cagan there And she cuts who Walter Rogers their correspondent in Baghdad Right, sure you've seen him Yes, he gave the report on that poor soldier that was killed trying to Disarm a one of those improvised bombs And he reported that in the last 24 hours six of our troops have been killed And I've been scouring everywhere all over the internet Yeah, where do you know that's true? Yes, yes This is I can't even find a story on internet about the one soldier there at Mitting God killed I'm just done to buy this at a time when the president is receiving a lot of criticism for this 87 billion dollars on top of the hundred seven billion dollars in tax cut Why I don't hear too many people complain like this check I'm just checking right now. We have to either find there finally admitting now two after days Without an American fatality Two US soldiers were killed in separate incidents over the last 24 hours US Central Command says well Walter Rogers just confirmed that he had spoken with him at Santa calm and six soldiers according to his report this morning That six soldiers have died in the last 24 hours and for what and for that's the question We got American kids dying over there every single day. They've been lied to another saying we have no idea how long you're going to have to be there We have no idea when there's no end in sight that the war is really still going on as well. We'll for which it And this you know the public is delighted when everybody watching Wuppy Goldberg Well, I have one question to ask you and everyone else out there if our troops want to come home and their tours of duty have been extended long Do it on the contract that they have signed aren't they now technically conscript You're asking me well, I'm just I'm just pointing to that out. It's just sort of like a point of order maybe for a computer Point of order folks point of order. I don't know somebody maybe knows the answer. I don't know you know what they technically conscripts and that they're there Beyond there. I think under the paper you'd act in under the main date of Donald Hermann Kiring Rumsfeld are going to be there as long as we want them to be there regardless That's too good luck to us all. Thank you. I think it's the Scott Junior philosophy We just decided they're going to be there without pay have a great day sir. Good. Yeah, we're going to take the care of veterans aren't we? The situation it's a scandal of people in set up crews are right man. They got it right on the money in peach today Before this insanity go it just gets to well already is totally out of control 87 billion Yeah, it's worth it and it has nothing to do with the war on Terra as he keeps saying nothing to do with it zero. Somebody do that the the PNAC people decided this whole iracatech years ago We've had even a stole a 2000 election But don't and of course you won't find that the mainstream media you won't find nothing about that I'll say it again without the media there are complicit there are part of this audio media assholes out there And I know you listen to people of the CNN bureau or Miami y'all listen to this show You're much our lunatics you're much a grave robber shame on you Just like in Vietnam it only went only went after the public went nuts Mostly on college campuses first and then finally when the public began realize how many thousands of kids were coming home and body bags and they really totally turned against the war only then Did the media finally decided like start telling us the truth? Because if you wait there truth from the US government I'm not just talking about bush. I'm talking about anybody in the US government. You wait here the truth. You're gonna wait a long time till health freezes over heavy duty for a hockey game And how about that? I 16 WQM if you've got a big ugly bald spot.

There a girl 12 years old settles piracy suit for two grand This is so embarrassing man I mean what when it when is the public going to like start being alarmed by the kind of crap that's going on you know George Orwell is spinning in his grave A 12 year old girl in New York was among the first to be sued by the record industry for sharing music over the internet Is off the hook after her mother agreed yesterday to pay two grand to settle the lawsuit Apologizing admitting that her daughter's actions violated the US copyright laws The herid sent a settlement involving Brianna LaHara and honors student Was the first announced one day after the recording industry association of America file 261 such lawsuits across the country Lawyers for the RIA said Brianna's mother Soviet torre is contacted them early yesterday to negotiate We understand now that file sharing the music was illegal to a certain statement distributed by the recording industry you can be sure Brianna will build we doing at no mal no No mal As a matter of fact, she was playing that on the phone. She stole that from us too. Yeah, you said Brianna won't be doing that No Brianna added. I'm sorry for what I've done. I love music don't want to hurt the artists. I love The case against Brianna Was a potential minefield for the music industry from a public relations stand point the family lives in a city housing project in the earth's upper west side And they said they mistakenly believe that we're entitled to download music with the internet because they had paid 2999 for software The kids and access to online file sharing services. How do you like that making it even more embarrassing? Even in the hours before you believe them. No, oh, but it sounds good even the hours before the cinema was announced Brianna was emerging as an example of a critic said was over's Elis enforcement by the powerful music industry the top lawyer for Verizon communications in charge jury yesterday during a Senate hearing that Music lawyers had resorted to a campaign against 12 year old girls rather than trying to help consumers turn to legal sources for songs online Verizon's internet subsidiary is engaged in a protracted legal fight against the RIA over copyright subpoena sent horizon customers Senator Dick Durban never quite available. I also alluded to Brianna's case Are you headed to junior high schools to round up the usual suspects? Durban asked RIA president Kerry Sherman during a Senate judiciary hearing Durban said he appreciated the piracy threat to the recording industry, but added I think you have a tough public relations campaign to go after the offenders without appearing heavy handed in the process Sherman responded that most people don't shop left because they fear they'll be arrested We're trying to let people know they may get caught there for they should not engage in this behavior Sherman said yes They're going to be some kids caught in this but you'd be surprised at how many adults are engaged in this activity And now that they got the public re-skired crap in their pants nobody's going to be sharing files download no more Now I just like hearing that I love that I did it.

Okay, I also watch I also watch some of the Deed debate in front of the black caucus last minute as well black caucus And some of the things that I did here in the media part of what you didn't say do caucus did you Collar the one caucus okay, okay, so one of the things that heard were and just you were speaking of earlier also One of the questions was asked to Security does he think that president Bumbleclod purposely to see the public and he danced he did a Greating silly impersonation then the person went to who Bob Graham and F.M. and it's after was yes Beautiful little straightforward It was perfect. Yeah, yeah, Graham is really sensational which is probably why hasn't that a chance? I know it's scary He's such a up front person. He's like right what we I was on the intelligence committee He knew and he should have known that there was no imminent threat that he had that But I'm a thing had nothing to do with anything have to do a 9-0 11 and Yeah, he purposely deceived the public and I was waiting for a follow-up question Do you think that's an impeachable offense for knowing ever after Too bad Karen right away is a wafer you know in the beginning he supported he voters for it and then they turns around now Well, he didn't have an exit plan yadia He's he's a wafer Howard Dean to me is the only one that's really a boot stop and it's right from the beginning oh yeah, I'm part of the part of something else It has the NF No matter foot, leave him in Oh We should count how to To Israel and of course he was by him and in high and about it and as I were dean of how it seems like no You can't be partisan on both on either side either you're gonna be you know You're gonna be a somebody who's gonna bring peace or are you gonna kiss somebody that you can't be a mediator and be on one side Is it just an impossibility and leave him in of course?

Probably does have the pictures. Just dummy up, buddy. Please, before you dig the hole any deeper, you're already halfway to China. Other than George W. Bush, who is the most dangerous man in the world today is our pull question. We had an earlier pull about this show and it was interesting. You think it was interesting? Kilt's in time though. 274 votes on this one already. Dick Cheney is time with Donald Mumsfield 52 other than G. W. The most dangerous man in the world today. Osama's 41. Kim Jong-Eel 27. John Ashcroft continues steadily climbing toward the top 25. He's goose stepping his way toward the top. The Pope 22. He's kind of slupping toward the top. Mohour David in 19. The O'Rajus 15.

Hello Mr. Rages. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Okay. I have a suggestion for a ball. This sounds like you're chronic. Go ahead. Oh, um, how about we go to the screen. What is it? Charlie. Go, Shahvez. Spick an inglaze man. Hugo, Shahvez is the most dangerous man in the world today. How about senior Shahvez? 5 6 7 0 5. What? Trace that last call by the way. If I need to be deported. Send him back to Caracas with his maracas. And some sea lacrosse these. Speaking of that, here's Hylia. Hello. Niel. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. I didn't know if you got a chance to mention it or if you've got a story article. But last week in the Miami Herald, they had like a really small article. And towards the end of the article, they asked Laura Bush, which thought about what was happening with the soldiers that were coming back in, you know, body dikes. Yes. And she answered that she didn't want to. And they're beautiful minds. She didn't want to worry about what was happening. Instead of being sympathetic to the families of our soldiers that have died. Yeah. She was like, I don't want to worry about it. I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I believe he is. Yes. In other words, if he just blocks that out of a mind and pretends it doesn't happen, then she won't have to feel so guilty and so bad. The same way that she's blocked out of mind that her daughters like to drink a lot and party and booze, but. Right. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you for pointing that out. Because if we don't know what a bunch of degenerates the Bush family already are. Nice divorce there, Neil. I'm sorry. And I semester with a silver rattle, I Chanel. But the public doesn't care. They just don't care. Like I said, jab Bush gets caught with his guy. They impants down with his mouth wide open, making stupidity out of comments on tape. And a public says, hey, well, how soon can we put it back in? And again, we like this. Crook. We like this freaking liar. So why should we get upset about you know, we just we just live our little pathetic meaningless lives and do the best we can. That's all. Your life means as much as it means to you. Isn't that great philosophy? Sure. That's right. If it means a lot to you, then it's important. You know, if it only nothing, then. Oh, I like this. Law let students forgo senior year. I wanted to mention this yesterday. I think I didn't mention you but touched on it. I touched it briefly. Of all the ways intended if we have space and Florida crowded classrooms, this one could be a dream come true for high schoolers in a hurry, a diploma without a senior year, which I think most of you are aware of if you've been any attention. Supportors of a law granting high school diploma in just three years, that will help curb crowded and Florida schools, quit experience the private early graduates of extra curricular activities and senior year milestones. The state's top education officials already warning that the new law's essentially enabling students to forego their senior year is not for everyone it shouldn't be abused. It was meant for a small group of band of students who were not only mature enough, but smart enough to graduate. Education commissioner Jim Horan said it's not an attempt to be a teacher class-sized pressure to do away with the 12th grade. Right, of course not. It's not part of those devious plans you think. No. The fast track graduation laws among civil measures passed the spring and wake of the voter approved amendment requirements state to take immediate actions that reducing class sizes. The amendment sets caps for every grade including number of 25 students per high school by class by 2010. Under the option, students can graduate with six fewer credits as long as they have a lot of English classes to earn four credits instead of four language for two years. See, there will have to skip several elective credits including physical education art and life management courses. The audio audio, the audio and a part of it. It's just more the same crap. Ten complaint about the education in Florida because generally speaking they're ain't none. Do I say Florida in America? Very sad. $87 billion. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Now they're saying the critics and the accurately. So that's only the lowball figure. Because Georgie always did like the highball himself every now and then. But it like the eight ball before he found Jesus and weighs a little behind the ball now. Without a Humpty Dumpty problem that he can't put the pieces back together again. $87 billion. To try to extricate ourselves from this mess, all based on a tack a lies. But nevertheless, the public says, hey, what time is the party start? When did we get to vote for Arnold? And what time is the Wuppy Goldberg show back? What's that treasure island show? What is it called? Oh, her island temptation island. I don't watch any of those shows. I do like the previews though. Interesting people on the previews. Depending on the line if they get that temptation island. I still say the best of those shows. Was the, um, am I hot? Are you hot? Is it hot? Is it boiling? Is it raining in large gorge? Or it's spurt? That damler ends up ruined it for everybody. I don't know why he got such a bone up your ass about Lorenzo Lama's. Uh, cause he sucks. Well, that makes him even more desirable to some. Rums fell 50. Yeah, let's take a peek at this. 58 for Rummy Rye. No, he is dangerous now because he's losing it. He's absolutely losing it. And the troops when he was over there on the last weekend said, hey, don't come talk to us. We don't want to go home. We don't want to nothing do with you. You're fascist. You'd not see bastard you. You ever see him in her mongering together? That lately. I'm thinking of myself because I was watching on the Discovery Channel, which I do like a lot lately. I was somebody documentaries on the Nazis and on the Nuremberg Triumph. I'm thinking Nuremberg would be a great place for Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz and Richard Perl and he'll have that courthouse don't they? All these guys and Dick Cheney, the translators. Donner Rumsfeld 58, Dick Cheney 55, the most dangerous man in the world of ABCD's Wichita goes without saying. Osama, Yamanah 43, John Ascroft, steadily, who stepping up that ladder with 31 votes has just hopped over King Jung E.O. is got 29. The Pope 23, Mo Howard David at 19, the Arrogance 15. Now that's interesting, traffic did there because it goes to sure to even over Dodd-Ringold men were still dangerous. The Pope Mo and Yers truly. Russel in Baudk 12, Paul Wolfowitz 5, Jerry Falwell 3, Ariel Shirons got a pair now. Oh, hey. I probably eat it. It's kosher. Pat Robertson won and Richard Perl won out of 297 votes so far. Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Amy, how are you? Pretty good sir. Excellent. What just two points? First of all, I was pretty amusing. And I don't know if this talks to us with the subject of the year that I have. But I put on the news yesterday and to see a group of women in front of the hotel that... Pearson Seasat. Right. I'm just going to call holding a fine thing that they love to push. Kind of. True. Kind of what we want to know there. I bet you jam might have been one of them. I didn't see her. I like being there. I'm going to. I bet you somebody had a good thing of you's like, yeah, let's put this on. What about Thomas Shirellale? You think she might have been there? I think she wanted to be there. Yeah. The second thing is you were talking about how popular the ratings on will be show work. Honestly, I think it's because this is actually the first show that has currish and humor on it. You know, humor that, you know, of course from someone, originating from someone who is from Iraq or from Iran or someone from that region. So I think that my prediction is in the future. You're going to see a lot of shows copying that chemistry. There's going to be a lot more shows. That's what I'm going to be telling you. The first thing I'm going to be talking about is that the first show is going to be a show. It's going to be a show. It's going to be a show. It's going to be a show. It's going to be a show.

It's going to be a show. It's going to be a show. It's going to be a show. The reason I'm pushing tomorrow is a little bit now is because at least this season, maybe they watched up the city, uh, Samson and the, whatever. They watched up a little bit. But the fact is, we're not being threatened. The people of South Har. I mean, you hear a little bit behind the scenes. The city of Miami is talking this and talking it. But it's not like it has been for so damn long. Now with a John Henry thing. If we don't get the stadium, we're going to be moving to Portland. We're moving to Nashville. And we'll pack you family. You know, that kind of crap. No, it's just that they're playing a lot better than anybody dreamed. They're doing it with Mike Lowell, a hero of late, and they're just that they're kicking ass without any threats. By the way, Mike, what's his name? Mike Mayo, hold a mail. Had the most stupid colonies ever written in his life a couple of days ago about, hey, we don't need new stadium. What's wrong with pro player stadium? The, the, the, the, what? The same place that nobody shows up at now? This is, seriously. I think I think Mike Mayo needs a little bottom. Since they got him out of the sports civil world and put him in like the real world, he can't handle it. He just can't, uh, and I know you're listed right now, Mike, you're good guy, but God, your columns really blow. VIP Sportsbook.com is South Florida's best sportsbook. No, blowin' over there.
