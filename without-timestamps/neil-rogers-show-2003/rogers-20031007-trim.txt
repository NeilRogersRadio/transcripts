Should it out? Should it? You'd get out. Parents just came in again. 175 votes on yesterday's poll. Now why do you have all of that folder all there online nine when we know exactly who it is? Got. Are you like becoming retarded or do you have a start? We need to be coming retarded. Here's our mystery chronic collar online nine WQAM. Happy to be here. Don't fire me, me. This is normal care. Is that good? It was what? I didn't hear word. Did you hear what he just said? He said he was normal. Oh, a normal. Squeeze this normal. Okay. You jackass you idiot. Quick given out my phone number. You jackass you simple little. I think he is interior defecating is what he's doing. Idiot. No seriously. The bad weed and just being retarded to begin with that'll let you get your every time. He's a weightball cashed it out. You know I mean almost as good as our good friend. Who's the dumbest of the model? He should have been on the poll this one. Yesterday we left him off. George W. Bush 343 votes. The American public 341. A almost caught him. They're right closing on his ass. My ties in 171. My tython. And in a course with 88. Jessica Simpson did bravery while 65 and after that it was no look and tend to be all small potatoes. So evidently those are the five dumbest people if you come up with next two. And of course and Jose Conseco 25. Greg Reed tied the Dan Quail 24. I think if we reload it one more time. What do you mean the American public? American public pants. I print this thing out so I don't have it right here. No 342 to 343. This is still on behind. I'm going to keep hitting it. Arnold Schwarzenegger only had 22 votes. He's the dumbest of the model which indicates to me that even this usually a little bit more stood audience. Do you think it's an an and we're really scary? It is absolutely positively scary. That's why they're really believe that's why they're coming out with all this stuff right at the last minute because they're desperate now that they realize that he actually is going to win. I don't think they took it seriously in the beginning. If nobody in a right mind could possibly vote for him. Like the broad on city pulse this morning. She's doing the California election story. And she says Arnold Schwarzenegger is in the lead. And she's looked at the camera and said he's done what? He's done what? Because he's determined it. That must be it. I still have these to agree David. Do you hear any of the speeches that he makes? I mean he just talks and he's not the highlight. He's not the highlight. Oh, by the way, almost need a drummer role for this. I have the story of the century of all the great stories that I've read on this show. Which I don't like too much reading because it's Pandu is, you know. Yeah. Right now anyway, Bob Fitzreccaz and Harvey Wasserman from the Columbus Ohio Free Press. And it's called Seagheil, the Bush Robe Schwarzenegger Nazi Nexus and the destabilization of California. You're going to love this. You're going to be squeezing your kneecaps. You're going to be so excited about it. Anyway, getting back Arnold had only 22 the dumbest of them all. Darrell Strawberry hit 15. Bobby Brown 14. How does site out of mind? I mean, you know, he's in the slamer. I'll have even sees Bobby Brown, right? Right. Wouldn't even even see him. He's a bomb. Bob, he Brown. Joe Carrillo had 12. He had a dozen. He's one of the dirty dozen. Mary and Barry had the same as sliced alone. Ever seen together? Oh, same person. Mary and Barry and Slice alone had nine of piece. Hey, Mary and what's up? You're nose. Martin Lawrence will Smith and Tommy. Cheese had Thompson had four of piece and zero four in last place had three. I guess if you're going to be disrespectful if they had too many votes for the former for a former US president, the current one we all know that's why he's in lead. Gerald Ford, who of course used to fall down a lot and couldn't walk in chew gum at the same time. So almost 1200 hooks on air was pretty successful. We got two poles for today. The poles are open in California. Let's go out there and vote. What do you say? All right. Let's send in a few absentee ballots just to make sure. Here's the poll number one. What's your take on today's California recall election? Arnold is in. Who's the mighty will win? Oh, yeah. The recall vote will not pay. The recall will not pass or who gives a Schmidt. Because after all, we are in Florida, not in California. And so as we as all of that, there may be a lot of people who figure who gives a crab. So does it afford choices? I don't think there's any other possibilities are there? No. Did I like that? Aliens warned. Aliens will invade California better than than us. Now we had a good time with Aliens. Plus the Apollo's got a chance to check his penis every few hours. See what we're still there. What's your take on today's California recall election? Arnold is in. Boost the mighty will win. The recall will not pass and who gives a Schmidt. I think that I think just four choices all we need on that one. Oh, look at that. It's up there already. This is New York man. He is smoking. Something smoking. Good stuff. I'm saying Arnold is in. I think I already. Yeah, did you? It's done. Five. Badger. Like somebody would say like Mickey would say. Five done. And they ought to care but they don't. All look at that. Arnold is in. Six and who gives a Schmidt. Six and Boost the mighty will win. One and a recall will not pass. Nobody have the first 13 quick votes. But two of those are ours. That's not possible though. By the way, got some bad news for you. Well, I mean that's his bad news. Wally George died. You died? Yeah. Who? Exactly. Now what was the quarterback? George. Jeff George. Jeff George. That's it. See, out of sight out of my because he's suck man. He was with the, uh, Colts. And everybody else in the league. He's he's not around anymore. As you're. I hope. And somebody like him had to been Jeff George. That died instead of Wally George. All a while. George was a right winger. So I guess we can't be too upset. Guy. Conservative talk show host Wally George. Who's prior to liberal guess for two decades on hot seed is died. He was 71. Pretty young George. No, not really. George the father of actress Rebecca D. Morney. See you didn't even know that. Neither die. I'm sorry. I'm out of the, uh, Mercury news in San Jose.

At all. They said that I'm a lunatic that I'm a maniac. He told a newspaper. But what do you have to? Why do you have to smile at your guests and be nice and let them say what they want to say? Say I like that. What do you have to suck your ass? For real. What do you have to suck? Uh, what's his name? Darcy Horticux. Ask. Born George Walder perch and opened to a former father like Chris and the owner of a shipping company. George moved to Hollywood with his mother rates 14. He became a district.

Morney who was in a great movie to hand it, makes your, makes your canados. Remember that? Sure. I love that movie. She was really good in that. She was excellent. She looks just like Hillary. You know what? Yes, she does. You don't think there's a striking similarity between Hillary Clinton and Rebecca D. Morney. Same person. Have them both take their clothes off. No, seriously. You watched that movie again. The hand that, uh, bakes your canado and you'll see. I'm trying to rat now. I'll be right there. You looks a lot like Hillary. You're allowing your anti- Hillary prejudice, which I share. You're allowing that to, uh, taint your, uh, you're, you know, I think Hillary, uh, when she was younger. I saw some of those younger pictures of her and, uh, she was doable. I never said that she looked good. I said she looks a lot like Hillary. I don't think Rebecca D. Morney is hot. You think she's hot? She was. Yeah. Oh, man. Is this going to be a day or what? Twenty-seven past ten in California. It's seven, twenty-seven in the morning and they're voting now. They're sending all kinds of bogus ballots. They're jamming them all out out out. And by the way, Arnold, I'm arrested me for last week. Arnold, I'm arrested everybody here.

One of his goals may have been to humiliate me publicly, but now is my turn to show him what I had discovered. On that auspicious day, lunch was served on the grounds under an enormous white canvas tent. One of my challenges that afternoon was the del Castro. There was a mischievous gleam in his eye. Then he said something that left me in awe. Hillary, I have a picture of you in my office. Mmm, delicious. Almost immediately, we crashed into bed. It was wonderful to lose myself in sheer physical sensation. A few days later, CD wonder called and asked if he could come over to see me at the White House. I answered, yes, you must come to see me. That night, I was ushered upstairs until to put on a wig and hoops skirt. And he periodically broke into giggles for no apparent reason. I'm not all that athletic anymore. But the next thing I knew I was swinging back and forth, squealing. When CD finished, I felt numb. Another surprise soon followed Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Mick Jagger. The Hildend Mine. After all, she happens. 1033. At 5.60, nobody can go away. Boy, those are the best. Yeah, she's got bugs up the ass against Hillary. Is it Beatles? Anyway, 59 minutes were already on a pole. What's your take out of this California recall election? Who gives this mid 27? She had given the right choices because I know our crowd. They're Marlon and 10s right now. Yeah. Arnold is in 20. The recall will not pass 10 and boost the money will win only 2 out of 59 votes. Not looking good for old crews. You know who do a lot better? Freddie Cruz. Might have been better.

It's a 20. It's a 20. She'd be sweet, but she's dead. She's going to be a right. And she probably get more votes than Cruz Bustemonic. Because nobody's got any idea who that fat being a res. So that's the result of the pole so far. A lot of indifference, which figures. Here's a very amusing fact. You just sent, please do not read on the year.

Fox News channel like the White House got a ratings boost from in the aftermath of 9.11. The tactics were remarkably similar. Never executives gauge the nation's anger and panic and recognized war in Iraq as a rallying point provided they give you was the sort of firm leadership unsullied by second guessing was a smart call as from the Seattle Times. Once war arrived of course, Fox wasn't alone in the media campaign to win audience hearts. Other cable channels in a worse made self promotional aay from Dash and correspondence, surrounding Iraqi soldiers and masterful bombardments hit the music. What great TV we got to bad a lot of us were knuckleheads about the facts. Adjust release report by the University of Maryland's program on international policy PEPA. Finds a majority of respondents have missed perceptions about the war. No. The results show that 48 percent incorrectly believe that the evidence of links between Al-Qaeda and Iraq have been found, 22 percent that weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq, and 25 percent that will depinion favor the US going to war with Iraq, a walloping 60 percent of who are held one or more of these misperceptions. You know her? Yes. How did we get to be such doops? PEPA quiz respondents on their main sources of news information their findings are at right. As you'll note and I got the findings right here at my right on the far right. As you'll note, Fox's audience scored the lowest. That's fodder for arguing the only place it's fair and balanced model reading belongs is on the cover of a satirical best seller. The more closely you followed Fox, the more misunderstood of misperceptions you had to play Ramsey PEPA research director, no other news outlet came anywhere near that. He said that in a separate examination of you were citing Fox's primary source, 45 percent he'll all three misperceptions. While the findings for Fox may not be a surprise, second among ill-enformed viewers as CBS, long considered a bastion of anti-war liberalism by subscribers to websites like rather biased.com. Apparently, benightedness cuts across eveological lines and no network or cable channel can claim its viewers are well informed about the worst most critical issues. We're like one nation under DA. Well ain't he the president? DA? DA? DA? I like that one nation under DA. This is from the Seattle Times. It's not our website. No, it's not our website. Is it? It's not. It's not. 80 percent. Had one or more of the Fox viewers, had one or more of these misperceptions of those three or categories about the war, 80 percent. Only 20 percent had none. CBS, 70 percent had one or more. ABC, 61 percent, NBC, 55, CNN, 55. The print media, 47 percent, and NPR or PBS had only 20 percent. Share these misperceptions, and they'll clue what that was all about, where these places are on the map. In other words, what this article is trying to say is the American public is dumb. Not smart like us, but dumb. Sing a high all the way till I get to read this article. Okay. Can't wait. Do it. Sunday, a bulletin around. Send a memo and speak in a single memo around. I'm sure you must have a pilot checks on the desk there from our sales department. Everybody else in a building for abandoned pair rest you to get over. I have no idea what we've got because he just loved me in the lurch now. I know we got an appearance I think on Thursday. We'd like. No, some time. Today. What? Hate, see them. No, no, he's too busy sucking around for my goddamn Marlon Cubs tickets. Why? In local. We're sports radio, 560s. You a M. Tonight on Action News, new clips and campaigns for Governor Gray Davis. It's California. I'm worried about. I don't want you to become a laughing stock, a carnival. I ask you to embrace new ideas. This is big. So in comprehensively large and we all to do it. And we all to do it together. More than a hundred thousand positions all across America. On tonight's. Action News. Indeed, I did have a relationship with a million Americans, including even my wife. 1043 at 560 WQM, 99 votes on the pool. What's your take on the latest California election? Of course we have a very socially conscious audience. And who gives a schmitz leading our hands down 47. Nobody cares. Even though it's about Arnold Arnold is in 32. The recall will not pass 17 and four cruise boosted money. Boosted money will win as only got three votes out of 99. Not looking too good for a four seeded cruise boosted money. Then guess who's not going to be elected president? Bobby. Bobby Graham. A war for the senator Bobby Graham in it is bid for the presidency after a struggling again momentum or raise cash in a crowded democratic field while leaving open a possibility of another senate campaign or even a vice presidential run if asked. He said if he's asked he'll have to run. Graham who said his candidacy failed because he got in the race behind several of his rivals and in a hard time raising money became the first democratic dropout. I felt the best prepared and most able democratic candidate to be elected president. He said in a statement Monday night, I've concluded this is not to be. A combination of factors is convinced me reluctantly that my dreams for the presidency are not. A tenable. Graham 66 one of the most popular politicians in Florida, but he attracted only single digit support national presidential polls and could reach his goal of praising 50 or 20 minute bucks to fund his candidacy. If we were to just pitch then he might still be in a running. You know what? There's nobody here. He's departure could benefit other candidates such as senator juleberman or Connecticut who hoped to get a fundraising boost from Jewish donors in Florida who were committed to their home state senator who are really from and where their pace and sits is all over the place. Within an hour of Graham's announcement long shot piece candidate Dennis Cassinant's urge Graham's anti-war supporters to join his campaign. Graham said he's not the side of whether he would run for reelection to a Senate seat Johnny Adiani and he said I'm Larry King live. Uh-huh last night. So Bobby Graham's out. Damn it. I mean, might as well, right? Right. What's the point? He's just spit in his view. We weren't how we anyway. We want how he dean. And I still him on yesterday. What happened with the interview? I'm somewhere in CNN, I guess. I don't know. Or maybe it was on MSNBC, which nobody watches. He was kind of weak. I mean, he was okay. But he was a little bit weak. Uh, I'm very much for him. But I, he's not really, uh, I don't know. He's not a little bit speaker. He's not what? He's what? Dynamic? No, he's not dynamic. I mean, Bubba. Even though he was like a hillbilly for a cracker from Arkansas, he was dynamic compared to these guys. And his own kind of Yahoo way. You know, it was like a good speaker. He was slick, Willie. It was slick. That's what Monica said. It's slipping out of a armpit. See, I can't wait to read. I'm going to keep teasing it. Wow. He's teasing it. Huh? Curse you. I'm going to read it over and over again. Oh, here's the picture in his story about Fox slanted news. Fox news channels are back work coverage featured reports from course, bonnet, Harald O'Rovera. And it shows the picture from all the way. And like silly goose again. Too bad. Too bad. The movie is beautiful. The show is disappearing here. Okay. So this is a picture for buzzard. Okay. All right, let's start with ... So the original method of knowledge is exclusive to the singer. So it is Not bad but any lecture, sabe. Cool thing. Well, we will take it back. Okay, sure. Okay. Uhm, I probably talked about uhhh... Joining little words. Okay. I was I was at the Marlins game with my family and they were four girls sitting in front of me and the whole game I was talking on a back of the head with a baseball bat actually the funny thing is I had bought my one of those little wood baseball bats and it was quite tempting at the moment Yeah because all they did for I would say good for any things to talk on a phone and we could do it they don't really care about the game like most of these people are going to be at the games and Friday and Saturday they don't give a crap about the Marlins or about the game but it's just a bad wagon jumping effect they must be there you know it's a gift significance to their lives well that was quite evident because I was sitting next to a die hard baseball fan about two friends who those those are their first time and he was explaining and the people that allowed the people to the back and everybody's like sharing some of the models and these girls all they're doing it talking to them thousand and that's all about like they want to be there okay well that's a great day you said it about six times already it's getting kind of ponders five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T Verizon line mad dog a two the hump or is back for a day work that after being professionally Jewish yesterday humpers back for the seven doing the show at school of stay two Marlins pre-games seven seven forty five it's the pre-games special with Tommy Hutton and Lang Caspard seven forty five Marlins on deck which goes on forever never for like thirty five minutes the game doesn't start to late twenty nice gun but light you more on you idiot eight twenty to eleven a class little kids won't be up the sea it's just like the world serious all this other stuff because but light in the baseball people are just stupid and that's so the way it goes Marlins at the cubs it really feel and everybody's gonna say oh well that's because the game is in Chicago it's in Chicago so that's why they got a well play at that time I noticed though that there's no difference on Friday when the game is at pp pockets at the same time you know that's got yes I do and how come we don't have Saturday's game on the schedule all the kind of a horseball schedule is this man who's making up these schedules what kind of a retard is making up these programs schedules good god almighty out-to-norm is the only interior defecator in that place I think must be clearance because game three is on here are we assuming the Marlins are gonna win a three straight or lose for what is this ever hoping for the best what's the best to seven boy in Saturday is gonna be probably they can't fit it on here because Saturday we got her coins at the Florida state which is the game of the century according to them my idiots you got the Panthers and a Bruins which is a regular season game and we're committed to carry that but also we're committed to carry the Marlin game as Presidents plus it's a playoff game also the Panthers are probably get pharmed out to like waxy seven ninety or some states that nobody ever heard of they can pick up on it out like at seventeen forty on a and banned ESPN four great so I mean who the hell knows that's why they don't have it on there because they don't know whether the scream or a look of an Anna and go all-own Clarence's case practice makes perfect five six seven oh five six be we love the Marlins twenty five hundred bucks for his my article from the Palm Beach post here it is tough call live for twenty five hundred bucks or TV for you see

What's your take-out today's California recall election? This audience, they don't care, well. And yet, not as well known, a lot of people saying, well, you might be in the 125, but you can't win. 251 votes, who gives this mid 128.6% say, the California? Arld is in 85%, the recall will not pass 39 and crews at Taco Bell, most of them, they has got only a 5 votes out of 254, not too good. Even Celia Cruz has been dead, she's not even warm anymore, she's got more votes and pretty crews in a quiet storm, has got the 7,000 votes. Or look at his Arnold's going to cast his vote any minute. We throw the term Christian right around a good bit, but Tom McLentock comes from that segment of the, you're a good one to talk to you, the God bit. She's part of the God squad. In the next segment, I'm going to read that article by Bob for Tacos and Harvey Wasserman. Good, stop teasing. Put Macas from the Columbus Ohio Free Press. And they headline that the article is SIGHA, the Bush-Rose Schwarzenegger, Nazi Nexus and the destabilization of California, which I think you're absolutely, you'll be squeezing it. Here's plantation, hello. I kind of like, oh, I kind of like, oh, that was a shirt. Don't you love this? Here's a call from plantation, hello. Yeah. Yeah.

And we was going to sum the money, which I had what he has. What a penis. Let's see. Over the years, which celebrity you think has aged the best. This is, uh, you know, I'm sure they can add to this list. If they really put their thinking cap. You know, it's that guy. They cranked the call to calls back. He was sitting there like, uh, you know, in the middle of some kind of a circle jerk, right? And then he's waiting on hold in two stupid, even understand that we're listening in on whatever he was a yankin. And then like, oh, well, we don't care about Canada, but you're a seeer, you're whatever we're interrupting your busy day for you that you're listening to the show to call in bust my chops, my balls. Okay. You silly ass offload a moron. You, you, invacil who probably paid $5,000 to sit in the upper deck in the noise leaf. They got the Marlon's Cubs game on Friday. You idiot you. If you don't care about what I'm talking about, then ask the liveista baby. 21 till noon, we got the mad dog at two. We got the Humphorate Chulas at four. I said, hey, kid, like all last week off at a baseball, let's see, he's on to today tomorrow, Thursday, out at Calder with that Kaplan. So that's almost like a day off. He's going to be punched in his brains out. And then Friday again, a really brutal week. And the hop-rash will work like just about all week long. That was fun. It's definitely like a little play the out there with the IDK on Thursday. Nice going Hank. He's doing it. But wait, don't forget, let's get wild. The playoff pushes on and let's get wild the playoff runs on. They both suck. That's from the Susan Racin at the Marlon organization. Those are their cliches. They're just they suck Susan. I don't think a person unless you want to, but it's very lame, very weak. It doesn't say anything about the Marlon's there. By the way, the games are all sold out. Although, the next 10 colors, I think we got some free tickets for them. Don't we Scott? Sure, if you say so. 21 till. Probably Scott has already acquisition some of those from soft. Probably. You think? Got to fund my way through college. Anyway, let's see how a hot those tickets are going to be with us audience. Funny what I'll tell you in at 560 QAN. You a-am. Brudge Packam? This week on lifetime, television for women. Monday, it's the classic and brutally honest landmark film, My Breast. Tuesday, it's the award-winning documentary My Other Breast. Wednesday, it's the lifetime of original feature film The Breast I mentioned before. Thursday, see a repeat showing of Joanne Stark's feminine masterpiece both My Breasts. And Friday finishes off the week with the made for television movie My Vigina from a breast perspective. That's all week long on my phone. Television for women. Because even television for women is still programmed by a male. 144. 16-Hill Don My Psychic Powers are astonishing even me. I voted the a new pool came up on our thing. And I clicked on John Stamos and the moment I clicked it, guess who came on TV on the spot for 10-10 douchebags among those phone deals, Barbara Eden. Now John Stamos. That amazing? That is amazing. He looked pretty good. Oh, I see. He's really probably not going to get too many votes and he's not yet because he's not that old. How old would you see here? About 30 minutes. He's more like about 40. I'll write. 40 is not exactly old. Especially the old fart. I'm a geezerish. And then he read, Barbara Eden's got nine. So feel a red and four. John Stamos and Brad Pitt have three of peace. Well, we'll see. We'll see. We'll get some other names on there. I'm sure. I can't believe you forgot one. Yeah. Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp would be good. He still looks almost the name of the same. You're right. He is a good choice. Johnny Depp. See now the reason you notice that the two females we have on there, it's not who you have the hotstour. That's not the question. But that's what they'll vote anyway. Barbara Eden. It's still like to hop on her bones. It's like to open up that bottle of have her float out. Here's a call from Pittsburgh. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. They signed a goal. You appear finally that. Yeah, see that. They signed that kid. What else is name? God, forget. Van Larnon. Oh, I came up with it. He's a frog. He's some kind of a frog. By size of that last time. I wanted to ask you something. He said it was pretty good to me. He said about this whole thing with Arnold is to get rid of a cruise boost to Monte. So they can sue and run well. Well, first of all, cruise boost to Monte won't be gotten rid of. He's still a lieutenant governor. Yeah. And then rather than having money anyway, they're bankrupt. So what if he's soon? Did you ever see the way it was bankrupt? And Ron is not out of business, though. See, they're bankrupt. They're not out of business. They're the difference between declaring bankruptcy and going out of business. Yeah, but when you go bankrupt, all the stuff that owed people. No, it depends on the conditions of the bankruptcy. Depends on the bankruptcy agreement. OK, well, one thing I never understood was whenever, if let's say FT and L over charge everybody in Florida. Yeah. How would that hurt the state of Florida's budget? It would help us because they pay taxes on their income. So that actually would help the state of Florida. If FT and L over charge everybody in Florida. Right? I mean, think about it. I don't know what your budget is. Absolutely. It's got nothing to do with the budget. You haven't seen how to hire an inculp, man. He's stable now. Every time he starts talking, this game that was pretty depressing for him. He didn't say much. And then he just said, well, both of them are free. It's a good one. He's a good one. He's losing it. And have a great day, sir. Call from Pittsburgh. Anybody have any idea what you're going to say about it? Yeah. 560560. Oh, my pentac just cast his vote. Good old times. You got any chance? No. Weeks of this campaign. All the major Republicans in the state rallying around Arnold Schwarzenegger. And sending a not-so-sottle message saying the only- A Nazi-sottle message. Win is the night behind one candidate and all get behind Arnold Schwarzenegger. Let's get beyond Arnold. Is he qualified? By the way, 11 of the last 15 elections, Arnold didn't vote. And the last California and the federal election. 11 of the 15 didn't vote. So we know he was very politically astute. Very much involved in concern. Right. But Arnold's got a plan. He's going to clean up the mess in Sacramento, baby. He's going to do it. This today, this is what America has become. This is the epitome of it. I'll say it again. George, what was the guy from the actor 100 years ago? George Murphy. George Murphy. George Murphy. He became a US senator from California. He was a actor, but he was- he was a very distinguished guy. I mean, of course he was a Republican, because those guys all tend to be. But George Murphy, and then of course we had Ronald Reagan who was the head of the screen actors, and used to be a Democrat, but then became like Republican born again. Well, he made money. Right, money. And then you're part of he made some money. But the fact of the matter is that at least Reagan was polished. That means he had the Kiwi. He polished on his hair. He was, you know, he was very articulate. He was a smooth, as butter, you know. And then all of a sudden that we've gone, hey, why are I think it started with a sunny bono thing out there. And they can put it, Florida all the way. Which we do have many, many, many, many problems. A lot of big problems. Not curting man. The fact that I made it was California is where all of these showbiz people, all of us had become big celebrities. How about Shirley Temple Black? Remember that? Sure. She was a member of Congress. Shirley Temple's Black. And when he found that out. What have we changed our vote? Man. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I think I'm going to read this now. Okay. Seagile, the Bush Road Schwarzenegger Nazi Nexas and the destabilization of California. George W. Bush's grandfather helped finance the Nazi party. Carl Robs grandfather allegedly helped run the Nazi party and helped build the Burkano death camp. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Austrian father volunteered for the infamous Nazi essay and became a ranking officer. Together they destabilize California around the break of bringing in a new right. With a Schwarzenegger candidacy they've laid siege to America's largest state, lining it up for the 2004 election. The Bush family ties to the Nazi party are well-known. In their 1994 secret war against the Jews, Mark Aaron's and John Locke's used official U.S. documents to establish that George Herbert Walker, George W. Bush's maternal great grandfather, was one of Hitler's most important early backers he followed money to the rising on fascist through the Union Banking Corporation. In 1926 Walker, W. Bush's new son-in-law, Prescott Bush, father, president George Bush number one, grandfather, Bush number two, hired as Vice President of W.A. Herman and Company, Prescott became a senior partner when Herman merged with a British American investment company to become Brown Brothers Herman. In 1934, Prescott Bush joined the board of directors of Union Banking. The bank helped Hitler rise to power and also helped him wage war. As late as July 31, 1941, well after the Nazi invasion of Poland, the U.S. government froze $3 million in Union Banking assets linked to Prince Tyson. Pricom was noted in the American Preses a German industrialist and original backup aid off Hitler. Loth his rights the Tyson's American friends in New York were Prescott Bush and Herbert Walker, the father and father-in-law of a future president of the U.S. That would be the current president's father, George Herbert Walker, Bush also the former director of the CIA. On October 20, 1942, the U.S. government ordered the seizure of Nazi Germany's banking operations in New York City was one of the rest of Prescott Bush. The government seized control of Union Banking Corp. under the trading with the enemy act. The liquidation of the day reported 750 grand a piece for Prescott Bush and George Herbert Walker, the book, the splendid blonde-beast money-law and genocide, goes into exhausted to tail on Bush Herr Men Nazi money laundering. More recently, Michael Kranis covers the same Bush Nazi relationships in the rise of the Bush family dynasty published in the Boston Globe. Post his documents that Prescott Bush knowingly served as a money-longer for the Nazis. Remember that Union banks' books and accounts were frozen by the U.S. alien property custodian 1942 and not released back to the Bush family until 1951. Often ignored are the Bush family's post-World War II dealings with the former Nazis, John Foster Dulles would work with the Bush family in the Hermann Company and Laudbury money-pronazi Germany with what is now a secretary of state, his brother Alan Dulles became director of the CIA. As Martin Lee documents in the Beast Reo-Wakins, American intelligence recruited numerous top Nazis to spy on the Soviet-Stream Accord War, many established connections to the Bush family to help finance their original rise to power. In 1988, Project censored in its top-of-word no-to-how-many mass media ignored overlooking their undercovered at least 10 critical stories reported in America's alternative press that raised serious questions about the Republican candidate George Bush dating from his reported role as a CIA asset in 1963 to his presidential campaigns' connection with the network of anti-Semites would not see in fashion civilizations in 1988. Investigate a reporter West Boladis established ties between the Republican Party and former Axis Nazis and fascists. In 2001, the Columbus alive published a series of articles documenting further links between Bush's senior and the Reverend Summian Moon and his own fascist never since Japan and Korea. Carl Roe has parallel ties. The shadowy Roe serves as Bush's brain in the current White House. He is the political mastermind behind the California coup and is now in a headlines for outing Valerie Plane the CIA wife of Ambassador Joseph Wilson. A consummate strategist Roe may have outed Plane and Repentalliation for Wilson's faded a backup of the Bush claim that Saddam Hussein was buying nuclear weapons materials in Africa, according to some published reports as many as 70 CIA operatives have been put at risk by Roe's retaliatory strike. According to Wilson and retired U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Al Martin, Roe's grandfather was Carl Heinz Rover, the Galgala Tir of Oldenburg, whatever that is. Do we know what the Galatir is? No. Rover was right, stop the halter, Nazi-State Party chairman for his region, or I love those words. He was also a partner in senior engineer in the Rover suit, Deutsch, Ingenburl, engineering firm, which built the Burkano death camp at which tens of thousands of Jews, gypsies, dissonance and others were slaughtered on mass. Octuliba. Exactly. I like to leave her with bacon onions, please. Rover was the based in Utah, and associated with a Mormon church as widely viewed as the cheap engineer of the current Bush administration. He and Tom Delay are attempting to force the Texas legislature to redistrict its congressional delegations and adding seven sure seats to the Republican column. By controlling the state houses in the York Florida, Texas, and California, the GOP would have a lock on the four largest states in the Union, and thus the ability to manipulate both counts in strip-footed registration rules, and they're brought up to the 2004 election. Rover is a prime behind the scenes mover in the Schwarzenegger camp, on May 1, 1939, a year after the Nazis took control of Schwarzenegger's native Austria, his father Gustav voluntarily joined Hitler's infamamus SA, Groundshirt Stormtroopers. This was just six months after the Groundshirt's played a key role in the bloody Crystal Lock the Tax and German-Eas Jewish community. The Vienna-Dinni, the standard noted recently that Gustav, a high-ranking Nazi, brought up the bespectagled rather frail boy with an iron fist in quite a few slots in the face, Arnold's father favored a Hitler-style mustache in photos. On October 3, ABC Newsbrook the story of Schwarzenegger's 1977 interview, in which he was asked, whom he admired. Schwarzenegger replied, I admire a Hitler, for instance, because he came from being a little man with almost no formal education up to power. I admire him for being such a good public speaker, and for what he did with it. To cover himself Schwarzenegger's made substantial donations to the LA-based Weesendhal Center, which tracks down X-Nazis and also renounced Hitler. But he is not renounced his friendship with Austrian-Curt Waldheim, the one time ahead of the U.N. with well-known Nazi ties. The book Arnold and Otto unauthorized biography documents Arnold post-engved time, but participated in Nazi atrocities during WWII, and is winning the Maria Schreiber. My friends don't want me to mention Kurt's name because of all the recent Nazi stuff in the UN controversy Arnold said, but I love him and Maria does too, and so thank you, Kurt. On May 17, 2001, Schwarzenegger also met with Kenneth Kenny Boyle of On-Rider the Peninsula Hotel of Los Angeles. Through the utility deregulation plan signed at law by Pete Wilson, Schwarzenegger's chief adviser, California, was a destabilized bankrupting the state government, and opening the offer two days recall election, Leia has been judged as W. Bush's chief financial banker and a close associate of Carl Roves. According to Bob Woodward's Bush-it-war Bush attended the New York Yankees game soon after 9-11 World Trade Center disaster, which we all remember, he wore a Fireman's decket, as he threw out the first pitch the crowd roared, thousands of fans stuck out their arms with thumbs up. Carl Roves sitting in the box of Yankees under George Steinbrenner, likened the roar of the crowd to a Nazi rally. He would know. That's it, that's the article. Bob Petrakis and Harvey Losson from the Columbus Ohio Pre-Prin. It's interesting though, now, years ago when I talked about these right wing fashes and called the Nazis, oh, Neon, you go too far, you're so liberal, you're right. And now, everybody you're looking at is just a small goose step away. I will teach you why we like everything. Now that he is on it, just get here on the world. There's all we hear, yeah. Your tears hold you then, there'll be a big change. You gonna feel for it and you'll feel the pain, yeah. The loudseed plans to pass into the warmth of our view, I've blacked up a little again, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I feel it, you're loaded in a hill, you're cursed. You won't feel this for you, you're the worst, even kids will get them traded.

I'm pretty sure the guy's question from Chris, but I thought about it for about 20 seconds during the break. Maybe a little longer than 20 seconds. I've heard, man. And the Senate California was buying energy from these companies, which was galging and ripping and that's been repping and pillaging. It reminds me of what's happened right here now in Ontario, even though the guy's money here about Canada. Very much like what happened when we had the big blackout. And right now they had to shut down one of the power and the nuclear power plants yesterday for like they're going to look it over and pee on it, whatever they're doing. And anyway, they shut it down, so they're having to import. They're having to buy a visual wanted just to make sure that we don't have any blackouts or brownouts. A bottle of them saying? Sure. So that cost them money, just like back during the big blackout for those 13, 14 hours, whatever was. And the same thing in California, they were we gouged and raped it into the pool of billions of dollars. Eight and a hundred percent increases in rates when the deregulation took place. Right. So we just mentioned that in passing to try to decinfuse our friend from Pittsburgh, who though it doesn't want to seem to be confused with the fact, so although he doesn't know a lot about my own coke, but he's been all should charge a whole lot of money. Right. He shredded the coke. What do you mean? I was about my own coke. Over the years, which celebrity do you think has aged the best? That's our pool.

Don't forget we got the game for it and, of course, with a very, very, terminally boring day van boring and the outstanding Goose to Shambi. Who got to be doing a whole game? They want to be lucky. They just even let him in a ballpark when you come right down to it. 745 Marlon's on Drek and then 820 is the first pitch allegedly Marlon's at the Cubs at Rigley Field. But one that's going to be some gathering there. First time in 95 years in spite of the crap Scott was peddling instantly that they made it that they won a postseason series and now they're going to be championship finals for the first time since they had the wild card and all this other crap.

Long time. He was married to that blood, nickelette Sheridan from not slanting. You just came to me. Oh, I know, was it? Yeah. I guess. Or is that somebody else I'm thinking of? I'm pretty sure he was not just somebody who could have me Ralph. Okay. It's always playing teenagers. He ended up like 80. Ralph Bob, well, we could put Robbie Benson on there too. But we were like, what he looks like anymore. Plus he had a heart attack on all kinds of problems. Plus he was doing. Oh, but Ralph Machio, did we see him anymore? Not lately. So why would we put him on? Or if we don't know what he looks like now, I mean, granted. And you know, days gone by, but keep him mighty. He was married when it was like 16 years older something like that. Did you know that? Yes. When he was like a little punk. And his message to you by the way is, come fool or something. It sounds similar to that. Who was the name of that old Chinese guy, Pat Marida? Oh, yeah, Pat Marida. Very good. And awful movies. They're good. They're terrible movies. They're awful Ralph Machio one. He's like a nerd. I've got probably pretty old by now. Bob, third man. Yeah, and still looks the same. 21 till 1 at 5, 60 WQA. And the mad dog is doing a show like right there in the studio. They would have no idea why. She would be doing it from her degree field at this radio station. And he brings it all. They had them right up there in Chicago, wouldn't they? No, you know why? Why is that? There's a garbage strike up there. Six days old. You are the most, there's just, there's something missing. You know, I'm talking to your brain. If they could just find, I learned something to the missing link is in your brain. There's just something, no, there's nothing ever good would do. It is always some negative, some sour, you know. I hate to even give you all those hockey tickets you're begging for because you'll have something negative to say about every game. Like the Panthers get their ass kicked in most of those games, if they probably will. But so it don't give me any negative term reports. And then, of course, the assholes that will be sitting around you, which I promise you that. I know that. Because I know who they are. I wonder if that guy's going to be sitting in front of me again with his poor little kid that has to put up with his behavior to hold game. Oh, God, Phil Salsman's buddies. Twenty two on, but nevertheless, you'll take the tickets any or like him Scott, okay? And like I said, mad dog should be doing show in Chicago, what do without the garbage?

Yeah, I'll just talk about California, even though audience spot half of them said, who gives a Schmidt is basically what they said. And who the hell can blame him? Here's Pompino, hello. Yeah, I know. Yes, sir. Yeah, I've got two additions for your list, one male, one female. Yes? Female would be Kim Bachelinger, or basing her, whatever she pronounces her name as her. What, basing her, yeah? Whatever. And the guy would be Jeff Bridges. I met him a few months ago, and I thought it was mid-15s, and he looked like he's like 80. No, no, he looks quite good, really. Does he really? Yeah, I'm... Did you anything with him? No, I don't know. I just bought him, I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I just have to work, but that's about it. You know, one of those, you've got the resource that is in cat and the baby's bones, these girls are like in the early 30s. How many agents race? We haven't even eaten any of these. And these are since the 40 list. Did he start? No, he's not 40. He's not 40. At least. No, I'm sorry, you're not the niece. So I've been here for cat and baby, Jones. He's like in early 30s. There was a sort of thing about her. And that's a good point. What's all she doing on there? And if at least they're ready to be on this, I'm all kind of aging, is that. Does those are the same people that voted yesterday that would he get to be 25? You're old and you're not happy with your birthdays anymore. Exactly. And I don't know what's going on up at Eric Gittering, and so forth there. And I know it's going on in California, but I just hope they put this recall down, because I'm a feeling we're going to see a lot more of the surrounding consciousness. There's this happens there. So it's like, you know, if you don't like somebody, you know, even after a week, my brother lived in California. He was telling me that you can have a recall for the governor at any time, like even, let's say, two months down the road after the day. Recall is the older one. That's what they're talking about. They're saying that if more of these charges come through and investigate them, they turn out to be true, and he's committed all these crimes that the first thing that Democrats are going to do is start a week off, because it'll be easy for them to get the signatures on petition and I'll have another damn election. You know, the political system of this country is messed up enough, but this definitely rivals almost rivals if went on down here back in 2000. I think they got his beat. I think you just wait, like I said about the absentee balance. Just know. Oh, yeah, that's the truth. I mean, that's true. Everything here was taken from a found in. A people will willingly go in along with this process, which is, doesn't say much for the collective IQ of California. Well said, have a great day, pal. Let's get what's in him off at our Katherine Z. Jones plus he married Michael Douglas, so we don't like her anyway. That'll be like you like her, but that's for different reasons, because you want to hop on her, and you're never going to get to hop on her, and never going to touch her, so you might as well dislike her. Speaking of Leon Harrison Kirby, Puck in my favorite all-time memory of Tony Cigaretteau, was when as the own sportscaster on Channel 4, instead of saying, Mike Schmidt, he yelled out, well, Mike Schmidt without the M. See, I kiddo's not a bike to say, it turned Ralph's neck even redder, and he fell off his phone book, and we've reflipped his wig. How do you like that? I wish I had to see that. Sure. Maybe there's a tape. Silly asked Tony Cigaretteau. Now let's see, here's something for the asshole, I just called, US political climate has some heading north. Oh, yeah, for all you anti-Canadian's up there, that think everything is so wonderful in the USA. Think everything is good in the USA. For all these sherry economically and culturally, Canada and the US increasingly are at odds on basic social policies to the point that at least a few discontented Americans are planning to move north and try their neighbors way of life. A husband and wife and Minnesota, a college student in Georgia, a young executive in New York, each has distinct voters for packing up, but they agree the United States is growing too conservative and they can't offer them more inclusive, less selfish society. Absolutely correct. Amen. For me, it's a no-brainer said Molly Ingabrand, a Minneapolis puppet theor, Pennsylvania, Vancouver, BC with Laura has been in two year olds son. They probably would have come to Toronto, but there's too many Jews here. And you know those Swedes. The most amazing opportunity I can imagine, she said, live in a society where there are different priorities and caring for your fellow citizens. For decades, even while nurturing close ties with the US, Canadians often have chosen a different path establishing universal healthcare, mainly tending ties with Cuba, imposing tough, uncontrolled laws, two current Canadian initiatives to decriminalize marijuana legalized same-sex marriage have pleased many US liberals and earth conservatives. And it goes on a great length. Thank you so much for the article, okay? There's lots of people coming on up. Come on up, okay? It's several of you sourputs. Don't come here because they'll kick your ass out. People who are friendly, they're pleasant, they're happy, there's much stress free. But that's just the way it is. Oh, you can't see those things. We don't care. Well, I'm going to turn it off. Go listen to the rush, okay? Let the nothing I go. Pops and pills with the rush. Give me a song, then. It's about what I'm supposed to talk about. And the fact that you don't like it. See, there's something right there. It speaks for itself. It speaks for itself. Exploring misery. You ought to be pleased that I'm like 1200 miles away, so that you can export all your hysteria to hatred all the way up here. Probably like Salem all the way up to a Caloat and Lusja by the time a good stun. Right next to Messenheim. You're not too far. Right in your cap is casing. Who is cap is casing? Here's a call from plantation, which is right next to her. Hello. How could we forget Bob Walker? From the left eight. What is he 110 now? Yeah. He's not there. You're right. He's 100 years old. He's the looks and out of the over 70. You're right. He's still up in the can you can talk and function like the normal human being. He'll have a great day. Okay, too. No, he belongs on their Bob Barker show. No. I mean, he did the hearth thing, but he did that only because of the odd. I remember they showed a piece about that on E or one of those. Where he tried that. He asked the audience whether they liked the, you know, the white here, the older looking or the, the, the, died Ronald Reagan, the Kiwi shoe polish Bob Barker. And I said, oh, Bobby, this turn 110. We don't mind if you have white here. Are we still like you? Except for Diane Parkinson with her disease or whatever. And most of that her name, right? The one at Susan said he was pawned all over her and all out of the crappy. Said, said, spin this bitch. Bob Barker, nobody don't like Bob Barker. Especially the animals, love him. I wonder what he was thinking about that tiger. He was probably thinking the same thing about. As you're thinking, yeah, but exploiting was poor animals for the profit. What is it? It's one for them. The tires. It's a lot of tigers. Sure, that's one of their few victories in the year. I'll tell you that. Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, nearly through George Hamilton on there. It's getting still bright. Right. George Hamilton, you don't look at the over, uh, you're right. He looks to say he's been around around. I think he's 100, but he's still at 50. Yeah, right. Okay, he's on her, man. You think, uh, I could get my one tickets? Sure, hold on. I forgot to ask him how many you wanted. Just give her a hand. What? Just give him four. Okay, full. Give him what full, okay? I don't know if we want to give away any more than Marlon tickets. No, no, no, no, no. Come on. How about it, doesn't? No, no, no, no. Absolutely. Ha ha ha ha. Why I'm sure Mr. and his voice the last two morning. No, not. Although Geldey sounded, I don't know. Geldey sounded like his balls were in a ringer this more and more so then usual. I mean, that's not a bulletin, but he sounded like, uh, I don't know. They're a ringer. No, no, seriously, he says voice was really thin. Not just squeaky, which it always is, but very thin. Like, like maybe he was in healing helium. He was sucking helium. 560560. Oh, this story. Speaking of fags, storming the big easy. Game already grow, targeted by Christian, piqued on a mission from God. Oh, God. During the annual Mardi graph festival, the atmosphere in New Orleans is clearly anything goes. But. Another why wildly popular New Orleans celebration in the annual Southern Decadence Festival or game Mardi graph is making some people wonder what the city's anything goes out of to you. Just playing go away, Oive. The Reverend Grant storms. What a shock. The Reverend Grant storms, who calls himself a fundamentalist Christian, piqued on a mission from God, is that the forefront of the separate. Maybe he's on the same mission that, uh, gave that towel down loan to God from a raw God to rush. You think? The first is so desperate for an pills. Why didn't God deliver a package? Storms as he became interested in Southern Decadence in 2001 when a fellow preacher described Luke sexual accident at the festival. Some of which you probably was doing himself. The following year, Storms went to the festival with a video camera and taped men exposing themselves having oral sex in public. All right. And bar rooms showing homosexual pornography available from the streets with a doors open. Storms took his tape to police to meet in lawmakers including state representative Danny Martinier Republican who reacted by helping passability toughens the penalty for public sex. When you have anything goes mentality, you draw people into your city. Have the same mentality. Martinier said, remember Mr. Martinier and Kuhu's next should do? The only time we have to step in is when they go over the line. I think this is clearly over the line. Many in the gate can't even be say what storms captured on camera was an isolated incident and not the norm. It's a party we get drunk. We hit the bars. Hit the restaurants where costumes have a good time throw beads. That's what it's about. It's a votes at Rusty Leroux this year. Southern Decadent's grand marshal. But storms boy by the success of his video campaign. Since he's preparing to wage what he calls an even holier crusade. holier as in holy moly would not holy. Right. Or as Aaron and Harry would say. Oh, he's strong. Storms filled ABC news. He wants to end Southern Decadent's totally utterly and totally he said. We want them out of town. In a city where almost 40% of the population is a Roman Catholic. The arts dicey of New Orleans agreed with storms and as the officials to bands of the decadents. But the head of the mayor's task force. I'm Gamla's being issued says the city can't afford to ban it. They can't do it. Many of the hotels restaurants bars in the court make up for losses through the summer weekend. Just through the summer, just during the weekend of decadents that Randall Beach. Storms condemn the city officials. Their prostitutes. They're legalized prostitutes as he said. But the protest only fired up the opposition. The New Orleans numbers were 100,000 and clearly influences the city's economy and politics. I don't think they've got to write to have openly sex in the street at all. Plan on it said participants in Tim Holt. But I do have a right to be who I am in the street. He's stopping on my individual freedoms. God damn it. The Bruce Eddie thought storms is very homophobic. Storms said he's not anti gay per se. I'm anti decadents, anti-depravity. I'm anti-Sen he said. And I'm anti-neal. I've ever thought he asked if he thought homosexuality is a sin. Storms said. Yes, oh undoubtedly the Bible's very queer, a clear is what he said. When Storms fought over us in the revelators of Southern decadents, ultimately met the streets echoed out with chance of Jesus and opposing chance of haters, haters, haters, Jesus, Jesus. There you go. I think there's only one conclusion we make about that. No, Jay. Yeah. What a revelation if you've put in that expression. To find out that the Jay, we talking about the old Jesus himself. And speaking of people who don't look all that bad, why don't you hear the Jesus they picked it by the golem? He never looked that good in the first place, yeah? Even when he's like a little baby who's badly in need of a haircut. And he's a weird sports radio 5. 2 AM. Oh, this is odd. He's not a tomb. It's the one to two hour. Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Propaganda, Prop Madhurt, What? I said, If the people they cannot pay, let them die. You know, underlive, been curious about this, so I must ask you, how does your lovely wife Marie-Augha achieve that, why her anger looking at cheeks? We will all go up, and get out of your own chest, droppin' But, I said, I hold her down and force why a hanger in her mouth. She has just a woman, under Kennedy. It seems someone just threw an egg at you. I much prefer tomato. You might mention my name, the rice master Gary. One or two at five, 60, they just showed his push on here again, you know, the happiness, California thing, because the post was at 80 clock out there, 11 o'clock, our time. And, uh, I'm looking at him, okay, and I'm thinking of myself, besides the Augustepping and the fancies and all that, what he shares in common with El Presidente, is the fact that they both look like morons. Not only do they qualify, uh, a sort of viable, but they both look dumb. I mean, really, really, the dumb, right? Absolutely. Yeah. And what'd you say? Absolutely. Here's the call from Fort Myers, hello. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Listen, I got two things to say, one is Bonnie Wright. He's a him. And the other one has been vulnerable, so is then the other one is, and one can we recall, Jim. Okay. And have a great day. Who, who, who, I put in Bonnie Wright on there, who is up with the name.

He can't help but he was just like Fort Myers, who have been in places in one of these days that lay him out and then he'll let tell the truth, he'll tell her real story. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. I got one for your list. About Jane Fonda. Somebody just backs that. Somebody you must be psyching. Somebody just backs it in. It's an excellent choice. She has aging like fine wine. Even a lot of people hate her like Poison, but that's a prerogative. But she's still a pretty good for about 80. And she sure does. She'll get my vote. That's for sure. Okay. You got a man. One other question. Yeah. I haven't been following this election too much in California. Great. Is this now, is, is our win today? Does that mean he wins the governorship? Or he has the right to go against great Davis or are they actually voting that there's something on the balance? It says, we want a recall. I'm not sure. But it says, it's a two-part thing. The first part says should we recall a governor. If they vote no, if it no exceeds yes, in other words, if no gets like 50% plus one. Great. And they turn down to recall, then it doesn't make it a difference to one the other part. But if they vote yes to be call a governor by one voter more, then whoever has the most votes of the 135 candidates of whatever it is on there, which almost certainly will be on old will be the next governor. Okay. So, but great Davis is on there for the second part. No. Oh, he's not. No. Well, why would he be on the second part when he's already still the governor? In other words, it's a free order. I'll see what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it. Okay. Thank you. Have a great day. Thank you. The first part says that should we recall him and if they be call him, he's no longer the governor. So, you know, not going to put him on there. They discussed that in the beginning. They were talking about that. No. That they couldn't handle more than 135. No. Let's see. Here's a chronic facts. What about handaway Jane Fato? This is what you were just saying that hot old winch. I'd still give it a old manly aid the meat pipe. Wow. That comic pink obits. Sure. Who cares about the hot.

Well, that's because you're so far away, Neil. You know, none of us were pretty resentful of all that Canadian crap. We'll speak up the Canadian crap even spells better than some of your American crap. I was right right now like backbaking. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line A. Almost hockey season man, official the season starts on Wednesday, which has come our last time I checked. Now the panties don't play until when Thursday.

Oh, you could have the tickets, but I don't know how you're going to get him. George would have to facilitate that for you. I'll pimp it. Will you? I'll draw him a map. I'll leave that in your hands. Okay. I'm not going to get, I'm not going to be the pimped myself and getting about the go between. Because I have a feeling I know somebody who's not going to have any interest going to see the panties in a Carolina Hurcones. I could be wrong about that, but I don't think so. Maybe we got a check in with a racing channel and see if we have any races from Caldery to the Anthropocetime for the first, fast and firm conditions at the Big-end number. Oh, the mental lands. Let's go to the mental lands. Yeah. You want to be familiar with that? That's in Jersey. And either whip, right there in your backyard. You start with a very Webster stuff again, man. You're going to give it up. Right, right out to the board. Oh, I know he's Jackie Mo. Here's a call from Jackie Lee. I don't know him. Here's a call from Kendall. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, yeah. I got to have the luck you. You got to have her lock clear? I mean, she's a... Give her up. Yeah, give her up, man. No, I got to. Joseph. Joseph. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. Well, he might have some Marlon ticket, stamp it. 560560 pounds, five60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Can it only be 109? I'm... I mean, I realize 50% of the science don't care about the California thing. And you want to know why? Because they don't understand the significance of it. No, they don't. And... and we did the... who's the dumbest of the audience that he only 22 votes out of like well over a thousand like what we have like almost 1200? Only 22 votes for Arnold. They don't get it. And you want to know why? Because they've been terminated. Because they've been brainwashed by the fact that he's this big gigantic ridiculous movie star. And he'll realize that he's done it in God damn... And he's sold us then ragweed. Man. Shocking. I mean, it wasn't bad. See, this goes to show you. There was a... oh, never again. No matter what it is, the Holocaust, the fixed elections. Never again. We're not going to sit back and put up with it. And you're full of crap. They can keep rape in you man and you lie there like you're enjoying it. Like it feels good, right? That's a good move. You bet. Gang rape. But it doesn't fucking rape to the... That's the guy. And so they stole the election in Florida right there in broad daylight. Let us in. Let us in. And that's Supreme Court, of course, these Supreme's, one day in a raw-svoted, really kind of put me off. And they stole that and the whole presidency. And now they're going to do the same thing to subvert the will of the electorate because they couldn't win a big, great, Avison last time would build Simon and so now they took simple Simon. Build Simon couldn't do it so they got simple Simon, aka Arnold. One of the dumbest people on the face of the earth, one of the most dangerous people. Because he doesn't even make a pretence of having any ideas. He's just... like Edgar Bergen would probably put his hand over his shoulder and say, hey, would you like to be my puppet? That's all he is. And a publicist is better. Ah, that's way out there in California. We don't care about that. We want to be care about the marlins. Do you care about the marlins? No. You couldn't give a flying rat to ask about the marlins, okay? If they would have gone 71 and 91 and finished 20 games under 500, you wouldn't have had 15 people there last a month.

I gave up three touchdowns in seven minutes span. A ride. Brother. So I think all of us can put our hands together. Kiss the radio and say the same thing. The Tampa Bay. Right. Screw them. I realize we have a few people listen up there. We do like Bernstein, Cows and Donna Tellows. We like that. We got a lot of people like the 2D bars up there. The Amans, Weeness and all of that stuff.

Thanks for the article. There ain't no way. I got time to read that right now. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll. The Pentagon could inadvertently be providing terrorists with special equipment that would enable them to make biological weapons. Oh my God. According to a draft report from the GAO obtained by ABC News that the GAO. According to the report, which is due to be released today, will already was. And discussed in the hearing of the House Government or Formsup Committee on National Security, Congress order the GAO. It's investigative arm to set up a phony company to see how easy it would be to buy surplus lab equipment from the Pentagon. Using fake names GAO investigators went to a website that sells Pentagon surplus and ordered items needed to produce back to your logical weapons including evaporators, centrifuges, back to your logical incubators, and protective clothing. And it's report that GAO found that the Department of Defense is not attempted to determine who is buying excess biological equipment or how these items were being used even. This is a real danger. And it's something we've got to close the loophole that we've got to close right now. So Darrell Kimball executive director of the Arms Control Association, a nonprofit organization that advocates effective armed control policies. According to the study, there's no guarantee that some of the surplus material has not ready for them to be the hands of people who want to use it for a criminal or terrorist ends. The GAO also found that some buyers would recently purchased use equipment from the Pentagon. Then we sold it to countries where terrorist have operated such as Malaysia, the Philippines, and Egypt. The Department of Defense hasn't been paying attention to this back door. Oh, sorry. Blackgums are enormous. They domestic market that can allow it now to be a sold abroad, Kimball said. You ever have one of his panels? One of them Kimball's panels? No. And the Pentagon's been selling the equipment at bargain prices. Some equipment that the Pentagon paid $46,000 for was sold to investors for $4,100. That could be a real bargain for potential terrorists to say. The cheap virtually unregulated availability of low-cost biological laboratory equipment poses a risk to national security government, before some committee chairman, RESTO representative Chris Shays of Connecticut said Monday night that a part of the defense should not be discount shopping outlet for would be terrorists. How do you like that? A dollar dollar dollar. Here you go. Want some anthrax? No problem. Want some smallpox? There you go. A pox on them is what I say. Another disturbing aspect of the report was that the GAO was able to buy surplus items that according to Pentagon policy are not supposed to be sale for the public such as protective suits. Some of the suits that the GAO was able to buy were of a type that had been determined to be defective. And according to the report, some of these defective protective suits have been issued to local and state-flon force med agencies. That sounds reassuring. Jesus, Kate Christman. Wow. That's enough to piss off the pulpit. He was alert enough to understand what they were talking about. What I don't think he is. Pops aren't away out by the way. That's good. And I'll see. Here, Dancin, I'm poor. What's his name's Grave? Rrrr. I'll dance on the pubs Grave, too. Believe me. We could do it, do it. Because I can't imagine that they could get anybody more right, way more for our vision more in stone age than the end of the, in this Greek and old pollock. Oh, you never know. That's a nice, you know, you're right. You're right. Probably the greener guy would like a little mustache. Just remember he's the one that appointed most of these cardinals. Yeah. Stan, yousial. Post off the air for two weeks. That's a nice station suspends to for meco remarks. See, I would tell you what I wanted today's cardinals, but I'm not, who's to get a one of the actually batting title by a minute of a point that he'll always home around seeing he didn't know anything. Scott, uh? Nationally batting champion is your seamless cardinals that the Julio. Of course. Puholes. Oh, no, you couldn't say it. I don't blame you. Puh. TJOLS. What kind of a name is that? Speak. Pastewoods, Syrian criticism from parents and political officials. W.E.E.I. and Boston. Yous, they remember we talked about this, uh, I did a couple days ago. Yes. Suspended prominent radio host John Dennis and Jerry Callahan for two weeks, for comparing and escaped guerrilla to a metco student waiting for a bus. The suspension for an ounce on the same day, one of the station's advertisers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, an ounce of a pulled 27 grand an advertising from the station, and donate the money to metco the voluntary desegration program that places Boston children and suburban schools. The two weeks suspension significantly increased the previous punishments of those. Dennis had been given a two-day suspension and Callahan originally was not thought to be involved in a marked face, no punishment at all, but not no more. The radio station called the remarks in sensitive and inappropriate and sent the state of the host metco students and parents will begin to heal. I thought you only said that elected dog. Oh, they'll be in double. No, I didn't say guerrillas, I said dogs. The two unpaid suspensions take effect immediately if not sooner it says. Both Dennis and Callahan have offered their sincerest regrets for their marks of volunteered to work with metco officials and students to create a constructive positive bond between the station and metco school students and parents WEEE officials wrote. As the criticism mounted over the weekend, Blue Cross Blue Shield decided to stop supporting the station with advertising said Peter Mead, the help providers executive vice president. You ought to be thinking about that before you start getting Gary Sarner-Pris star again Mr. Hachat, Mr. Rahmatmaidim, money-man action right now. What is it for? Nothing. I see start up again Scott. No. No one yet. Is he starting up again Scott? Yes. Now Scott's got some hockey tickets. See how easy it is? Yes. Yeah.

And when it was all a rangers, you know, his manima hold true. What did they get rid of him too? They screwed him up. They brought him up too long. Blackburn's real deal. They brought him up too soon. So he was like five years old. They made him know you're a goalie now. Victor, we're just gonna strap you in there. Let him shoot all the pucks at your head. Victor retired. Yeah, I know that. It was a little bury. What does that have to do with that? He does look pretty good though. I'll tell you that. I know I'm not thinking. Who's that Rick the other goalie that the bro ones have? Rick D. Pietro. Who's he playing for now? I would be leaders. I'll be leaders. I'll be leaders. I'll speak in my mind.

Oh yeah, and we can. She was doing Greek with Enrique. Anybody believe that crap? And a Cornoholio? My dick. My gaydar goes off every time I see her picture. Man, all you guys. I know you. That's good. Because that's nothing is in our man. It's even better. Being thing is in. And guess what? You're never going to meet her. You're never going to touch her. You're never going to sniff it. I know. I'll tell you that you can meet Tom Lamin and Joe Prieto. They probably not as lovely. And I'm sure they don't have tree trunk legs. I met Tom.

Don't be one of them phones. Anyway, listen to this carefully. Good. Thanks again. Reconfiled plantation. This is a Tim Predmore wrote this article. He's an unactive duty with the 100th Airborne Division here. Most of Iraq, a version of this essay appeared to the Peoria Illinois Star Journal. He says, for the last six months, I've participated in what I believe to be the greatest modern lie, Operation Iraqi Freedom. After the horrific events of 9, 11, 2000, runnin' with throughout the battle in Afghanistan, the groundwork was being laid for the invasion of Iraq. Shion always the term used to describe the display of power to the world. The world was to view up on the start of the Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was to be a dramatic show of strength and advanced technology from within the Arsills of the American and British militaries. As a soldier preparing to take part of the invasion of Iraq, the word shock and awe, rang deep within my psyche. Even as we prepared to depart, it seemed that these two great superpowers were about to break the very rules they demanded that others obey. Without the consent of the United Nations ignoring the pleas of their own citizens, the United States and Britain invaded Iraq. Shock and awe, yes the words correctly described the emotional impact I felt as we embarked on an act not just of justice but of hypocrisy. From the moment the first shot was fired in a so-called war of liberation and freedom, hypocrisy reigned. After the broadcasting recorded images of captured and dead U.S. soldiers over Arab TV. American and British leaders Vavra Venge, while verbally assaulting the networks for display and said vivid images. Yet within hours of the deaths of Saddam Hussein's two sons, the U.S. released horrific photographs of the two dead brothers for the world of view. Again a do as we say and how does we do scenario? We've been told that our purpose here as soldiers serving in Iraq is to help the people by providing them the necessary assistance militarily as well as the humanitarian efforts. Then tell me where the humanitarian humanity was and the recent stars and stripes account of two children taking to the U.S. military camp by their mothered in search of medical care. The children had been unknowingly playing with the explosive ordinance they found as a result was a very burned. The account tells how they after an hour long wait were denied care by two U.S. military doctors. A soldier described the incident as one of many atrocities he had witnessed on the part of the U.S. military. Thankfully I haven't been a personal witness to any of the atrocities unless of course you consider as I do this war to be the ultimate atrocity. So then what is our purpose here? Was this invasion because of weapons of mass destruction as we've often heard? If so were are they? Did we invade the disposal of a leader in his regime because they were closely associated with Osama bin Laden? If so, where's the proof? Or is that our encursions result of our own economic advantage? Iraq's rule can be refined at the lowest cost of any in the world coincidence? To me at least this looks like a modern day crusade not to free and oppressed people are rid of a demonic dictator, relentless and pursuit of conquest and domination, but a crusade to control another nation's natural resource. There is only one truth and its that Americans are dying. There are 10 to 14 attacks on our servicemen and women daily in Iraq and would appear that there is no end in sight. I was believed that a surfer of cost to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, and now I no longer believe that. I've lost my conviction as well as my determination, I can no longer justify my service for what I believe to be half truths and bold lies. With age comes wisdom and a 36 years old I'm no longer so blindly led as to believe without question. For my arrival at Fort Campbell, Kentucky last November, talk of deployment was heard and as the talk turned to actual preparation, my heart sank and my doubts grew, my doubts have never faded instead my resolve and commitment have. My time is almost done as well as that of many others with whom I serve, we all face death in Iraq without reason or justification. How many more must die? How many more tears must be shed before Americans awaken demand to return to the men and women who's job it is to protect them rather than their leaders interest. What a great article written by Tim Pheadmore. I'm written for his derby division. But see America can't be worried about that because today we're busy installing all one of the dumbest people in the history of show business as Governor of California. I mean, who doesn't have limited qualifications, I mean, who has no qualifications to be the governor of anything. He's not qualified to be the mayor of Canon Day, when New York. He's not qualified to be the dog catcher of Cassimmy Florida of anything. Arnold is going to be the Governor of California. Because generally speaking Americans are morons morons of salooning. Who haven't got a freaking clue of anything in the world, haven't got any idea where any of these places are in a map. And like he says, American kids are dying each and every day including female lifestyles. Anybody talking about it? No, because they just become immune to it. And just like the 50,000 kids they brought back after lies and put us into the in the Vietnam 50,000 kids in body bags. Oops. Oops. Mubat. Yeah. No, no, I'll be Jane ever even said his bad piece of crap. But the good news about LBJ is he's dead. That's her. He's rotting. The worms are having a good time with whatever's left and ain't much. 19, 0, 2, 5, 60 W. W. M. attention horse racing fans. Pompano park kicks off its 40th anniversary season.
