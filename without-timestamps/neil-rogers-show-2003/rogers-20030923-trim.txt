That's like saying that Martin Grammatic is tough. He couldn't beat my whack off. I'm about to rapist. The rapist is done. They gotta take down them billboards now. I'm not talking about the Miami rapist and talking about the Playskiger rapist. What was his name? I don't know. Dallas? Rape thingle. Nah, years ago, the rapist, the one I was about to rapy little girl. I don't remember that. I don't know. You're letting it win it. Scott, your mind's turning to cramp. Well, most youngsters come back. That's the bottom line you said it. But we're making it. At least you make it to work. I'm like, how are he? He shows up like, what? Two-stay? Yeah. Jesus. I mean, when you think they'd put him up like a fan-seeshmacy hotel after the ballgame and then no, him and then on Monday morning, no. I mean, we're number one in man and I did two live reads today. Let me tell you one thing. Okay. You've got 10.2 points in there. I know you can't figure it out, but in the last and the last month, we got 10.2 which means he's got a two and you've got an 8.2. That's what I'm figuring. I, you're always right. I don't know Jack about how you do that math. Yeah. Well, just keep it that way. Well, skip these spends two hours on a toilet. Scott says because of our crack sales department, man, it's with their selling crack. They spend the entire morning on a toilet every day. I go in and around 8.45 and Curtis is in a drop in a bomb in the bathroom. Oh. And I hear that Darine is, uh, he's becoming a dominator. She wants to type McGill on heaven, way with him. Yeah, McGill, cocaine, scum objects. What's his story? Oh, what do you think of the violence now? What a week to go. I think that if there's one empty seat in these last six games in his homestand at the town, you just roll up the carpet and close up. Yeah, and then there's no excuse, man. There is no excuse. Do you think that they'll go and lose the giants in the past? Yes. Do you think that the, uh, the violence, oh, hi, I think it'll go against fairly two and three, maybe? Yeah, they'll, I think they're going to sweep them. Be really? Yeah. So you think that Willis Beach, Millwood type? The top game is tonight with Don Trilk, because he hasn't won a game in what about how many days he'd be since he won a game in the world. He won a game down in San Juan. I just can't say he hasn't won a game in the Cunes days. That's bad. So you make something out of that. How many go try to close the sales deal, because they can't close any? Good luck to you. I good luck to you. You'll need it. Get to get these head out of the square and dance by the way. Why you're out of fact there. Great. It's funny. True, you have a cure. True, soothe me where I'm sore. I've got this real annoying thing on my butt. Right, come. It feels like one of those inflammatory woes. My back size pretty raw, no doubt about it. Sometimes the tears roll down my cheeks. Because my rear is killing me. It's always fair enough. That's why I'm standing up. Because I got him on my wrist. I can't stand down. Oh, right. I wish they were true. It's interwisher's things. And grab my wish and it won't help them go down. I went to the store because it was so sore. I caught that crossbow slaughter to my eyes down. Since I just hear it, it's closed down my cheeks. Because my rear is killing me. Oh, there's Dr. Rice. Dr. Rice. Let's be nice. Let's call Kindlea's Dr. Rice. She was just on their cup. All the veins that are neck like a stand up on end. Like the way Miguel's veins stands up on end when he sees Dorine. Yo. I'm just double-checking to make sure that you're there. Oh, right. We have all these dropouts and glitches there in the beginning. What else going on lately? Who knows? Must be Scott. Must be. I mean, Scott Jr. Yeah. Anyway, speaking of Miguel, he'll be 11-1 today at the Computer Technology Showcase at the Broward County Convention Center. Best in the LCDs will be available in the Howard Mohour Day with a absolutely change. And maybe some of the Jim Mad Dog Manics. Oh, right. Be changed, I'm sure. And you can spin the prize-veal from Arnold's tickets, even though Dorine's a liar. George says he's a freaking liar, and they don't really want to prize-veal any of these places, but she makes... She makes Miguel slip it all in his back because she's hoping to like, you know, bust his back and they won't be able to run. That must be the deal. Does that it? And that's not a bad idea. What can be the other reason? Ah, she likes to order him around. Oh, yes. She wants me to do that. Or does she need to come to work dressed up in leather with a whip and just look with him in the shape? She loves to do it. But she is a liar. That's what the George says Dorine is an effin' liar. He said that several times this morning, and I think he's probably got a good point. Probably learned it from Greg. Got some bad news that we got out. President, that day's going to be speaking to the U.N. And if you're national, yeah. That's about 10-30. I think we're going to carry some. And I will put it on for last for a couple of minutes. I mean, there's whole ratings. His poll ratings are so low now that almost everybody beats him. I think even dead people beat him in the polls. Well, we'd rather have. Yeah, that's right. In fact, that's prop up Adley Stevenson. Well, sure. Sure. Does anybody, even the people who didn't like? Who's some a name of dead president, quick. Let's put your hearing from him and back in there. He wouldn't take any crap. So it anyway, his poll numbers are at all time. Now, he's going with this tail between his legs. And he said that he's not going to be in the least bit apologetic. Well, you're still going to be like lecturing them. I mean, that's going to win the Europeans over real big. You know, like, oh, well, it was a wonderful thing for the world of you. We're going to saw them and you people. You got to learn that the you went, this is what they were saying last night. If you were to become, the you went is going to become absolutely meaningless. And the insignificant unless you people are doing something. Now, same crappy was lecture in last time when I said, no, no, if that's his stick, then maybe you should carry it. Oh, I'm going to put it on. Well, listen, that's what we're here for. The same say the word, oh, yeah, for our pseudo-inlectual audience. Now, let's see, for the most important piece of news that they and I've been just Scott for well, that even have this on a show, Gordon jump died. Aren't you depressed? Um, mildly, I like to. Gordon jump who played to be fuddled radio station manager on the sitcom, W. K. R. P. Winstonetti and made his mark in commercials as the lonely Maytag repair man died Monday. He was 71. Oh, you know, who I'm thinking was the Maytag we primary must have been before him. Was any bracket wasn't it? I know there was more than one. Yeah, any bracket. That's for us old farts. Booker Brian probably remembers that. Any bracket he used to be the Maytag a permanent and then it was Gordon jump. 71. He's suffered from pulmonary fibrosis said is cousin Katherine jump Wagner. Give her jump Wagner. But lately, the illness causes scarring of the era sacks of the lungs leading to heart or respiratory failure. Man, I'll tell you the Lord sure works in mysterious ways, then he's created all these diseases. It's like all these hurdles that we have to jump over just to get from point A from birth to death. It's to jump all over all these horrible hurdles that the Lord's invented must be our fault. We must have done something wrong. Don't you think? Oh, yeah, karma. And I will say this if we don't raise a thousand dollars. So that I don't know what the real number is. It's got to be about 24 grand for a band of per rescue and I've been banging away on this and banging away. And we're not making a hell of a lot of progress. I'll tell you that right now. It's pretty pretty disappointing to me. To see about a bunch of cheap bastards we got out there in radio land. Speaking of that, okay, this is the curtain. Me normally don't we start getting just just checks from benefactors. You know, 100 here, 500 there. Whenever we do these things, no. No, and when did that happen? Inside the building we get that. We get some of our people inside. Oh, he's going to sell them. They'll be for sure for a well-read nice check to a band of per rescue. There are some wonderful benefactors that always come across with checks. And always, hey, I don't know. People. Like maybe we know the help of such right. For a band of per rescue. You shouldn't be signaling people out matching names. This is your fault. Well, not talking about people. Talk about people that we definitely know. I'm talking about random people. They just send chat. Randy people. Randy ought to help out. Wow! After she saves the world, maybe she can share 50 or 100 bucks, huh? To save a dog. No, seriously. I mean, a band of per rescue is such a good cause. I mean, if you don't like animals, then you're an asshole. Okay, we don't like you. We don't want any party. All right. We wish you'd just go away and die. So there's no reason the world not to be able to say, oh, there's Christian, Amman, poor. They do believe he'll get the required number of votes for a new resolution. Who said that the media's full of crap. That's right. Christian, even though you suck the Pope's ass too hard. Speaking of that, speaking of sucking, what country do you think is the gayest country in the world, friends? And this article, by the way, is from Queen's land news papers. It's just a little coincidence. And this is on this fudge's website, which is also probably another coincidence. On the fudge report. The world's gayest country is another gayest not friends. Odd, Italy. Wow, what do you think's gone? Amsterdam. Amsterdam is not a country you asshole. Try the Netherlands. Amsterdam's in the Netherlands. Say Netherlands. Netherlands. Oh, well, we'll just keep doing the Spain. Thank you for the talk, ladies and gentlemen. All right, Portugal. United Arab Emirates. United States of America. Canada. Ecuador. Try Germany. Really? How about Germany? Mexico. Try England. They got a lot of queens. England. Ireland. Scotland. Mozambique. Nicaragua. Back is staying. Have you seen Chinese? China? India. Do you think it is a great one? We can go a little bit more. Since you're so, you're so far away. Oh, I know where all the flags are. I was thinking of war off Neil. He was just he white that played the Maytag repairman. Oh, it wasn't any black. And but he looked a lot like him. Very good. Jesse White that side. We don't you can't you see him right now. Oh, yeah. Look at him there. There. There we go. Oh, seriously. You remember what he looked like. He looked like he had a black and he character. But the, uh, how do you know what he bracked this? Well, he's uh, Bosomi years old. But anyway, it was Jesse White. He was the original Maytag repairman. And then this jump guy. He, uh, dump the gig. He jumped. He jumped right off into the Ethraland. Maybe Ethraland is the answer to the question. 10 30. The president's going to be going. Oh, please, please help. Baila soft because I got everybody into a bucket of crap. And it smells real bad and people are dying every day. And a country hates me like poison and a world of autonomy and a heaven for a long time. Please, all you insignificant meanless people. Who we are always a rippin' and ass. Please help Baila soft. And I think, uh, well, Christiana says he'll get the resolution. Aah. Oh, Michael, I quickly to take secretary general and answer marks right now. The state and government. Excellence. Excellencies.

About 12 and it's a 10.30. Speak to the end with his hat in his hand. Please, please. So I got all. Anyway, the world's gang is coming. I figured it out. And I know no matter what it says, you're not going to convince me that I'm wrong this time. Yes. I thought about it. Long and hard. Yeah. The Vatican. No. Well, Vatican isn't a country. It's a state, but it's not a country. All right, I thought about it. But at any rate, more than 17% of Australians are involved in. Oh, you're right. Yeah, right. And ships down under. Thank you. Putting the country equal first. And what is it? And for it, for it's purpose of homosexuals according to a new worldwide survey. The survey of sexual habits by international condom-maker durex found that together with Americans, Australians had the highest proportion of same-sex relationships. At the other end of the scale, Vietnam recorded the lowest proportion of gay-less being relationships at only 3%. The company said Australia enjoyed a busy love life having sex on average of 125 times a year. Squared, squared, squared, squared, squared. On humans came out on top, figuratively speaking, having a sex 150, two times a year, how do you like that? Maybe that's how they make that goulash. You think? Oh, oh, yeah. They're piled ravenant. But Australians were still ahead of Americans at under 18 times a year. It doesn't say how many times Americans have sexier in this article. God, good man. The survey also found phone, text, and cyber sex were gaining in popular in Australia. With 43% indulging in virtual reality sex, in other words, jerking a lot. I mean, this whole thing about cyber sex in virtual. That's just so silly. Yeah. On top of this one, phone sex. What? Phone sex. Remember that? That's what it said. Phone text and cyber sex. You were paying close attention. I do. The company said, taking orgasms was also common in Australia with 47% of respondents that made to do so at least once. This was almost twice the global average of 26%. Now that once this week or just once altogether. The survey found 41% of Australia and many women had sex for the first time because they were in love. And most agreed that more four play would improve their sex life. The company said more than 150,000 people, part of the online survey, which was now in its seventh year, more than 17% of Australians are involved. And not just doing like occasionally doing somebody, no? Or involved in gay or lesbian relationships. Wow. Are you ready for that? No. Yeah, I didn't think so. Wow. What do they call it going down under? Speaking of going down under, thank you very much whoever sent this for this picture of a Brady Quinn, holy Toledo. Not that very good copy that you sent me. I don't think this is also a great picture either. But I saw him live in the flesh. On Saturday and the ass into that the Notre Dame Michigan State game, which is Spartans one by the way. But I almost have a feel bad about it. That's how easy I am. That's what it's soft old touch I am. It's an honest today show. You mentioned that you'd seen part of Notre Dame against Michigan State game. The backup quarterback for Notre Dame is Brady Quinn. And there he is right there with a big smile on his beautiful posts. Even Georgia women he's a pretty guy. Hey, he's pretty guy. He is. He's a true freshman from Dublin, Ohio is supposed to be a phony for a make-belief freshman. Coach, you love that's my favorite sport. What a true freshman. What? Yeah. As opposed to a red shirted, uh, I've been here in the yellow belly, liver, uh, and he's a true freshman from Dublin, Ohio. Probably we named the starter for the next game since the current starter. Carlisle has played poorly and the Irish don't like that in the popgots all porkt off about that when Brady is six four, 210 pounds. He'll have his 19th birthday next month. Wow. Here next month. Here's picture of Brady. You might like it. It says more baby pictures available at in-skud like his long website. It would quarterback heaven dot pro board. Grower to back heaven. Woo. It comes to you. And that put that over my special pile over the right side. Okay, now yesterday's pool. Amazingly now. Maybe this is accurate. I don't know. I don't want to like say anything negative to her because she was a real sweetheart and we loved her dearly. Thanks for calling. But I think that some people got carried away and like goose up this pool somewhat. Who's your all-time favorite dead person not on the previous pools that we took? How many previous dead people pulls did we take? Not third man. Yeah. The thanks for calling lady. Thanks for calling. Wins hands down. Now obviously there were some. Happy plan.

Charles, now see this is embarrassing because Eric shows his ass to the world again and believe me it's fat and pimply and growtently my fault. What we meant to say was Charles Lindberg. I mean anybody doesn't know Charles Lindberg is got to be some kind of a moron. I don't know whether it's you or Eric or the both of you. But Charles Lindba. I mean don't rush to judgment on that. But that's pretty goddamn embarrassing. Charles Lindberg. Look, look, look, look, look. Remember the Lindba baby? I don't know. I don't know. So anyway, Charles Lindba, and again, we apologize for Eric's ignorance. There are good yellow momma, Kony, which I don't even remember mentioning him. And Alexander Fleming each had one out of nine hundred and some on votes. So that's yesterday's poll and let's smith can it. We got two for today again. The poll I like the best. There was the one that shows Bush way down and Wesley Clark up. Even though, you know, I'm with holding judgment. I'm not going to be one of these quick band wagon jepers. I like the fact that Clark's already had 49.46 movement. The polls. I like that. Aren't you? All right. I'm just don't forget, though. He's an ABB. Oh, what? Anybody but boy. Anybody but boy. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I'll vote for him a hundred times if I have to. If, you know, next year, if he gets it. But the point of the effect of the matter is he's a little, you know, he reminds me a little bit of kind of like a military Arnold, you know, like, well, what's your position on this? So what's your position on that? Well, I'm going to meet. But I've got to vote for him. And he got the waffle. They're the first couple of days about whether he supported the war. He didn't support the war. He's thinking about it. Maybe he said the wrong thing. So he, you know, he's like all of this full of crap. But he's not bush your right. But we will be hearing from Bush momentarily. So let's do the break. What that'd be exciting. Woo! I want to see the sweat porn office for him. 26 past 10 a QM, hey, speaking to your forehead.

It's like everything else. It's like they told us it was going to be 10 and about. I turned man. I'm 30 nights like, wow, but I beat, but we all are the other crap. Can anybody do anything on time? No. Isn't it always a breath of pressure like for example in Europe, the trains? Most of the time 90% of the time the trains run on time. When you're sitting on that train and you see the little hand hit the big hand and you feel, you know, you hear that whistle go to doors are closing and you feel that thing rolling man. And you see, you think yourself, man, what about, what about a higher even if you know what that means? What a wonderful thing. Like somebody can actually do something on time. Everything, dragging a feet. Well, it's going to be about, you know, just like when you're going to not some kind of a press conference, you know? And well, they keep showing you that they're setting up for it. There's the microphones and there's some engineer coming out there. Fix it is didlin stuff and twisting it around and Bob, Bob removed his doing cartwheels, you know? So I do something on time just once. The whole world's on a Cuban time. Right. That's the problem. Is that what they call a Cuban time? It is. It's true. Okay, the best. Here's our first poll. We've got to get to this before I'll present it. It gets in our, I think we can get the next break in. Well, this is good. We work out well, you know? Because that would be embarrassing. There is, is that the prison of Brazil? But I would have viewed it. I don't know. Block us all the time. Yeah, there's one thing that we don't want to hear. And you won't hear one word of your better not hear. Is this whiny, Aaron Brown? So help me see an end. Certainly not news. They've, they've reached new lows. You know, they got Paul Azan on there. What some guys want to look at Paul? That's okay. She's, she's mediocre. But, uh, whiny, Aaron Brown. I mean, Jesus, K. Christ this guy. Yeah, he's the worst whiner in the history of television. Okay. What a worst red hair piece. I've ever, in fact, today's got, he's got on the part of it is red. What do they, what do they call us? Remember we standing, we have that argument about the shoes. What they call us, uh, oh, the young. Didn't what? Again, not the oxford's the young. Whatever. How they were like, that'll soon. Saddle shoes. Saddle shoes. Is that it? Yes. He's got the saddle. We've gone today. Aaron Brown. It's part red and part black and little green around the edges. He's like a clown, like a freaking circus. Well, he winds all of them. Yeah. I wonder, nobody watches CNN. Okay. You sucked. You people are embarrassment. You're humiliating and degrading and Christian. I'm on poor head at right. You sucked ass man, altering that erecting. You set the whole. Just like CNBC did the gambling channel with, with all those dot coms and forestop of us. Those are guy damn money. And the same thing with CNN, MSNBC. And of course, box was without saying, at least they got an excuse. It's the box Nazi news network. So at least they were living up to their reputation. Bastards. So we don't want to get Aaron Brown's voice on air. If we do just chop it off or something. The best fast food chain. The reason I got it in this, we've done it before long ago. But it's worth it when again, because I got all carried away with that burger King yesterday. Right. And I noticed burger King. Oh, it's only an outscout one. Because the new pulls up there. Twenty eight people already have voted. I voted for Taco Bell, which was tucked between Taco Bell and Wendy's. They've each got eight votes tied. The best fast food chain. Taco Bell's got eight Wendy's eight McDonald's tree. Shame on you. Kentucky fried. KFC's got two. Hardies has got a pair. They're in that many around the heart is pretty good. Let's not hear. Yeah, that's what's not there. Pizza Hut one. Burger King one. Church is one. Boe jangles one. Sonic one. Arby's don't have any. And I don't want to make any comic.

It can be a color guy like the mad dog or it can be like somebody does a sports talk show like the hump or that or which. Yeah, it'd be a whole the whole thing. And then we still have the category on there. I hate sports for people that don't have a favorite because they don't want any part of it.

I throw Darcer to board to come up with a number for tax relief. And my plan. No one will get relief. For lower income families, you'll never get ahead. And this president doesn't care and won't pay. My attitude is government should stand in the way of families achieving their dreams together. We will do so. I hope you'll join me in standing firmly. On restraint. Some say my daughter is too big. Others. Others say it's too small. I respectfully disagree. This is right. Okay, wait and for a president and a couple of minutes. Somebody says stay in shake. How can we leave them out?

I'm a man, I'm a woman, most of them are too. We don't care about that. Okay, let's take a call or two and I'll keep an eye peeled on here. I just want to make sure I don't put Aaron Brown's wine. He voice on because that would be a disservice to the audience in the world. Just like CNN is doing a grotesque disservice. How can they actually put him on the ear? I don't understand it. I don't get it. This is a guy who was a weekend news reader at ABC. That was his claim to fame and CNN puts him on. And he's like their domain guy. Not that Bernie Shaw retired a couple years ago. They put this bozo on it with a bad hairpiece. Why, why, why, why, why, why? He's awful. He's an abortion man. CNN ought to be like not right off the ear for put that asshole on there. And anyway, I can't have said it about it. Here's a call from Davy. Hello. Hey, how you doing now? Pretty good sir. Best fast food restaurant got to be chick to lay. What is it? Chick to lay. Chick to lay. Best chicken sandwiches you're kidding. Is that a chain? Yes. Okay, never heard of it. But I'll hear from them in the malls. Chick for the rest of the night. I don't know if they're at that free stand. Hopefully they're on their way down. Oh, in other words, we don't have been soft for a yet. Not yet. They're in the malls in soft floor. But they're in the, they're free stand and up the north floor. It's tough. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, Pally. All right. I'll see you chick for a, one of these days. They're not bad. Are they really? They got these waffles fries? Oh, I'm sorry. Fries again. No, but why see waffle fries? Now you could you pick by interest? What the skin still on them? Hmm. See it. Oh, no. You're talking about something I could really get into. And the chicken is really good too. Yeah, but just like your ordinary pedestrian fries. For example, let me ask you this. When's the last time you had fries without anything but on a catcher, breathing on them this weekend? Really? Right. You don't, do you don't put no catch up? Sometimes I do sometimes I don't. Ah, I don't. I don't have to go eat half the batch and then maybe I'll put something on towards the end. Every McDonald's fries. Tastesless. Tastesless. You like mashed potatoes without the gravy or butter in the oven? You like mashed potatoes with no gravy dry? No, with butter. No. Halt and butter. Uh-huh. Here's a call from Papano, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. Hi, yeah. I was calling about Dallas Cowboys. More than you and Scottie were talking about. It names Lance Ritzel. No, no. Lance Ritzel was the flasher. Right. One of those marriages you're either. Right. Lance Ritzel was the flasher. I'm talking about they had a place kicker. Was it Rathiel set the end or was it somebody else? No, that one I don't know. I think I'll take the lantern and pull. Well, I guess they had a lot of prouver. It's okay. Okay. Go with the territory. That's what Jimmy's Johnson said. I don't want to say it was Rathiel set the end because I don't think it was. And then this sees. So I take that back and make it a disclaimer. It might have been. Scott should know the answer to this and I'm surprised for Reldon. See, this is one thing about for Reldon. He shouldn't be talking about sports at all because he doesn't really know anything about sports. And he's really a hoot if he just talks about getting laid and stuff like that. And big rags and big these. Those things, you know, I want to fill. Right. We have he does fill. I mean, I rather have filled on there rather watch playboy TV then Aaron Brown whining to a Paula's. Yeah. Yeah. God, how can he be on the year on TV all around a guy named Moral? You could be an Amsterdam. You could be in Australia with your boyfriend. Or have it had you are. Seriously, iners freaking Aaron Brown and you wonder why the world is in the shape that it's in right now. Go in on our hand. When the hell is this presenting guy going to show this trap already? I guess I better do the break early, huh? Okay. Because the speech is going to be 22 minutes they timed it. Okay. They did. It's 22 minutes long. Here's the lady in high, a hello. Nails. Yes, man. Hi, how are you? Great. How you doing? Pretty good. Nails. I got one for your pole. Okay. Okay. I totally agree with you to talk about totally talk about. When you're just speaking ass of the day, what? Good. When is this good? I agree. But when did you get a hit around lunchtime? So you can get a nice piece of meat. If not, it gets a little of a meek, it's a little dry. Nothing like getting a nice piece of meat around lunchtime. I agree with Aaron. Sure. Sure. I know the only thing that I find disturbing about Taco Bell is I'm sure you've, you know, you've done, you know, a couple times there because you like Taco Bell. But isn't it disturbing how they don't use gloves at all? I never know what's that. Oh my god. It's so disturbing. I mean, you see these kids there and you know, they're just kissing their head like you're meat? Exactly. I mean, it's very disturbing. I mean, that's all the only thing. Like if you don't get something like a Mexican piece or something that they have to nuke, you can't help but the wonder, you know, you know, about what you read that back up quarterback for Notre Dame to work at Taco Bell. Anyway, so what's your choice? What was that? Yeah, I thought you had another name. Another choice. Well, yeah, I do. I do. I just started listening right now. I don't know if you have it on the pole, but how about quiz notes? Oh, quiz notes is great. Yeah. So they didn't they send us food one day, yeah, yeah, quiz notes is sensational. You're right. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah. All right. And that's all I have. We have me here in Toronto too. All right. Cool. Cool. All right. You two, thanks. You two, thanks. Bye, bye. I don't want to rush you, but I'm trying to rush you know, because I want to get the break in because he may actually have got to be better. But we don't want to miss anything that I'll present to you as to say, do we? Is that twenty US, but you can't at least finish them for a few minutes, or you had to walk them round with you and all else. Which is to be included.

You're in your own yours. FOOT! A Q&A! Well, that's a lot even loves Neorodgers. The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to dumb at people killed. With the gas that we sold in Marmers time a crescernation and they only won that's going. Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing. Forget about Korea and the nooks that towed to Memphis were right. Queen is drilling it over and over it to our head. On daddy, rag, has some weapons of past destruction. 3,000 people killed. Our now-per-gotten, let's exploit them instead. Hey, there's oil to be gotten. Going after St. Tom too. Planked, O'Sama, there's no longer mention of the name in Latin. But no-asleep concern does. Come be in complacent. Believe in every word of this cartel-in administration. Back in Trolls is my fear through me and the manipulation and the right. Queen is drilling it over and over and to our head. And I rag, has some weapons of past destruction. And who would you like me? The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying. We're all suspects now, not the ash crop is saying. I have nothing to hide. People's partners all are saying. I know Bidian, can't hold on to him. And he is a vegan, proud of provoked Babylon. We're the annihilation, all regimes must fall and have a burden and stoke with no objection at all. Tell the crackdown how the falls have some right. Queen is drilling it over and to our parade washman. I rag, has some weapons of past destruction. Only I drag myself with the past destruction. The Puppy 7560 CUM, sir, getting on as far ahead of ourselves as we possibly can, right? Load up to make, to make, we're loaded up. To make way for this 22 minute address. And the president of Brazil finally shut his mouth. He said, boy, we can kick your ass and soccer man. That's what he said. He said, you may have a little bomba gronday, but we'll kick your ass when it comes to the big one. Now where is the doofas? I mean, where's all present days? No, no. That's the Brazilian guy to pat him on a back saying, nice job. And I give him a little sack of money as he went out. I wonder what he said. And they just had a little briefcase full like on Mark Hundreds. So I'm assuming now as there's the service pause and the action. So right now. So I think it'll be sometime before you get significant troop levels there. And then there, do I dare put on CNN because you know, I got it. I got it. I'm not going to take many nations to keep the peace. Oh, the soon. The soon. The soon. Oh, the soon. And I apologize to you. Who that whiny boy. Yeah. Aaron Brown. Well, what was that? Aaron Brown. On acceptable, on fit for human consumption. On acceptable, Aaron Freakin Brown. Another reason that CNN is absolutely a piece of turd. Okay. Ted Turner wants to apologize to the world. Okay. Now who is this goofball? Who's this guy that they keep showing on there? Because you'll notice when the person in Brazil was speaking, they'd, and none of the networks, including nobody is putting the audio on there. So evidently, whatever he said wasn't that important in the head of the dude with soccer. Oh, there is a goof as a sitting there. He's got a big smile on his push. The sweat is pouring down his forehead. There's colon power. He's still holding up those maps. He said, hey, you believe me? No. Oh, let me show you where all those weapons are right here. I've got a market of math. X marks the spot. And they're all going. Yeah, sure. Cole and tells another one. Maybe Cole can do a stand-up deal. Yeah, again, he's whining. I don't want to put, I'm sorry. I can't do that to the audience. He's also a conservative. Linda Doyle says, hi, by the way. Hi, Linda Doyle. How are you, sweetheart? What's he doing there? She was doing some business. Oh, do them business? Oh, speaking to do them monkey business. Here he comes. Here he comes. Oh, boy. And this press. Shut up, Paul. The president's going to be speaking. Show some respect. Mr. Secretary General. Mr. President. Nice talk up, Neil. I think which delegates ladies and gentlemen show some respect. 24 months ago. And yesterday in the memory of America. The center of New York City became a battlefield. And a graveyard. And the symbol of an unfinished war. And what did you rack-happened with that? Since that day, the terrorists have struck in Bali, Babasa, and Casa Blanca, and re-ad, and Jakarta, and Jerusalem, measuring the advance of their cause in the chaos and innocence suffering. They leave behind. I racked it all. Last month, terrorists are you on a merry board. Are you on a merry board? No, to the United Nations itself. The UN headquarters in Baghdad stood for order and compassion. And for that reason, the terrorists decided it must be destroyed. Among the 22 people who were murdered was Sergio Biera, a mellum. Was that me? Over the decades. What a good and brave man from Brazil. I gave help to the afflicted in Bangladesh. Cyprus. Mozambique. Lebanon. Cambodia. Central Africa. Kosovo. And East Timor. And was hating the people of Iraq in their time of need. America joins you. His colleagues. In honoring the memory of Sr. Biera de Mello. And the memory of all who died with him. In the service to the United Nations. By the victims they choose. And by the means they use. The terrorists have clarified the struggle we are in. Those who target relief workers for death. Have set themselves against all humanity. Those who incite murder and celebrate suicide. Reveal their contempt for life itself. They have no place in any religious faith. They have no claim on the world's sympathy. And they should have no friend in this chamber. Events during the past two years have set before us the clearest of device. Between those who seek order. And those who spread chaos. Between those who work for peaceful change. And those who adopt the methods of gangsters. Between those who honor the rights of man. And those who deliberately take the lives of men and women and children without mercy. Or shame. Like our military. Between these alternatives. There is no neutral ground. All governments that support terror are complicit in a war against civilization. No government should ignore the threat of terror. Because to look the other way, it gives terrorists the chance to regroup. And we prove. Can you answer to me any question for a better body rack? What is this happening with the president? They can all nations that fight terror. He's getting to it. As if the lives of their own people depend on it. We'll earn the favorable judgment of history. The former regimes of Afghanistan and Iraq knew these alternatives. And made their choices. The Taliban was a sponsor and servant of terrorism. When confronted, that regime shows defiance. And that regime is no more. Afghanistan's president who is here today. Now represents a free people who are building a decent and just society. They're building a nation fully joined in the war against terror. The regime was sat on the same. Cultivated ties to terror. While it built weapons of mass destruction. It used those weapons. An acts of mass murder. And refused to account for them. When confronted by the world. The security council was right to be alarmed. The security council was right to demand that Iraq destroy its illegal weapons. And prove that it had done so. The security council was right to vile serious consequences. If Iraq refused to comply. And because there were consequences. Because a coalition of nations acted to defend the peace. And the credibility of the United Nations. Iraq is free. And today we are joined by representatives of a liberated country. Saddam Hussein's monuments had been removed. And not only his statues. The true monuments of his rule and his character. The torture chambers. And the rape rooms. And the prison cells for innocent children. Our clothes. And as we discovered the killing fields. And mass graves of Iraq. The true scale of Saddam's cruelty. Is being revealed. The Iraqi people are meeting hardships and challenges. Like every nation that has set out on the path of democracy. Yet their future promises lies a dignity and freedom. And that is a world away from the squalid, vicious tyranny. They have known. Cross-erac life is being improved by liberty. Across the Middle East. People are safer because an unstable aggressor has been removed from power. Across the world. Nations are more secure because an ally of terror has fallen. Our actions in Afghanistan and Iraq was supported by many governments. And America is grateful to each one. I also recognize that some of the sovereign nations of this assembly disagreed with our actions. Yet there was. And there remains unity among us on the fundamental principles and objectives of the United Nations. We're dedicated to the defense of our collective security. And to the advance of human rights. These permanent commitments caused the great work in the world. Work we must do together. So let us move forward. First we must stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as they build free and stable countries. The terrorists in our allies fear and fight this progress above all. Because free people embrace hope over resentment and choose peace over violence. The United Nations has been a friend of the Afghan people. The stripping food and medicine. Helping refugees return home. Advising on a new constitution. And helping to prepare the way for nation-wide elections. NATO has taken over the UN mandated security force in Kabul. American and coalition forces continue to track and defeat out catatarists. And remnants of the Taliban. Our efforts to rebuild that country go on. Have recently proposed to spend an additional $1.2 billion. For the Afghan reconstruction effort. And our urge other nations to continue contributing to this important cause. And the nation of Iraq. The United Nations is carrying out vital and effective work every day. By the end of 2004 more than 90 percent of Iraqi children under age 5 will have been immunized against preventable diseases such as polio. For burculosis and measles. Thanks to the hard work and high ideals of UNICEF. I guess he's talking about the ones where still alive. Iraq's food distribution system is operational. Delivering nearly a half million tons of food per month. Thanks to the skill and expertise of the World Food Program. Our international coalition in Iraq is meeting its responsibilities. We're conducting precision raids against terrorists and holdouts of the former regime. These killers are at war with Iraqi people. They have made Iraq the central front and the war on terror. And they will be defeated. Our coalition is made sure that Iraq's former dictator will never again use weapons of mass destruction. We are interviewing Iraqi citizens and analyzing records of the old regime to reveal the full extent of its weapons programs. And its long campaign of deception. We're training Iraqi police and border guards in a new army. So the Iraqi people can assume full responsibility for their own security. And at the same time, our coalition is helping to improve the daily lives of the Iraqi people. The old regime built palaces while letting schools decay. So we are rebuilding more than a thousand schools. The old regime star hospitals of resources. So we have helped to supply and reopen hospitals across Iraq. The old regime built up armies and weapons while allowing the nation's infrastructure to crumble. Like ours, so we are rehabilitating power plants. Water and sanitation facilities bridges and airports similar. I propose to Congress that the United States provide additional funding for our work in Iraq. The greatest financial commitment of its kind since the Marshall Plan. Having helped to liberate Iraq, we will honor our pledges to Iraq. And by helping the Iraqi people build a stable and peaceful country, we will make our own countries more secure. The primary goal of our coalition in Iraq is self-government for the people of Iraq. Reached by orderly and democratic process. This process must unfold according to the needs of Iraqis. Neither heard nor delayed by the wishes of other parties. And the United Nations can contribute greatly to the cause of Iraq's self-government. America's working with friends and allies on a new security council resolution. Which will expand the UN's role in Iraq. As in the aftermath of other conflicts, the United Nations should assist in developing a constitution and training civil servants and conducting free and fair elections. Iraq now has a governing council. The first truly representative institution in that country. Iraq's new leaders are showing the openness and tolerance that democracy requires. And also showing courage. Yet every young democracy needs the help of friends. Now the nation of Iraq needs and deserves our aid. And all nations of goodwill should step forward and provide that support. Success of a free Iraq will be watched and noted throughout the region. Millions will see that freedom, equality and material progress are possible at the heart of the Middle East. Leaders in the region will face the clear evidence that free institutions and open societies are the only path. The long-term national success and dignity. And a transformed Middle East would benefit the entire world by undermining the ideologies that export violence to other lands. Iraq as a dictatorship had great power to destabilize the Middle East. Iraq as a democracy will have great power to inspire the Middle East. The advanced democratic institutions in Iraq is setting an example at others, including the Palestinian people. Would be wise to follow. The Palestinian cause is betrayed by leaders who cling to power by feeding old hatreds and destroying the good work of others. The Palestinian people deserve their own state. And they will gain that state by embracing new leaders committed to reform, defining terror, and to building peace. All parties in the Middle East must meet their responsibilities. And carry out the commitments they made it aquabar. Israel must work to create the conditions that will allow a peaceful Palestinian state to emerge. And Arab nations must cut off funding and other support for terrorist organizations. America will work with every nation in the region that has boldly for the sake of peace. Have we heard anything new here so hard George? No. Second challenge we must confront together is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. All are regimes that possess nuclear, chemical and biomarkiler weapons, and the means to deliver them. I'm going to be able to use blackmail and create chaos in entire regions. These weapons could be used by terrorists to bring sudden disaster and suffering on a scale we can scarcely imagine. The deadly combination of outlaw regimes and terror networks and weapons of mass murder is a peril that cannot be ignored or wish to weigh. Such a danger is allowed to fully materialize all words, all protests will come to length. Nations of the world must have the wisdom and the will to stop great threats before they arrive. One crucial step is to secure the most dangerous materials at their source. For more than a decade the United States has worked with Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union to dismantle the destroyer secure weapons and dangerous materials left over from another era. Last year in Canada the G8 nations agreed to provide up to $20 billion. Half of it from the United States to fight this proliferation risk over the next 10 years. Since then six additional countries have joined the effort. More are needed. The marriage of the nations to help us meet this danger. We're also improving our capability to interdict legal materials and transit. Through our proliferation security initiative 11 nations are preparing to search planes and ships, trains and trucks, carrying suspect cargo and deceased weapons or missile shipments. They raise proliferation concerns. These nations have agreed on a set of interdiction principles consistent with legal current legal authorities. And we're working to expand the proliferation security initiative to other countries. We're determined to keep the world's most destructive weapons away from all our shores and out of the hands of our common enemies. Because proliferators will use any router channel that is open to them. We need to broaden possible cooperation to stop them. Today I asked the UN Security Council to adopt a new anti proliferation resolution. This resolution should call on the moment for you and to criminalize the proliferation. Why am I hearing this? I don't know. I just changed my mind. He isn't going to say a goddamn thing. I'll get into his go to and say, you know, seriously. Two words, three words. All right. Because that's what this is really all about. I don't even say, but that'll end. That's all. That's what he had to say. Long history. I'm very good at doing that. Let those stay home. Anyway, I apologize to the audience for carrying this. I really thought that maybe this was going to be something monumental that he might actually say something significant, something like that. I thought so too. Didn't happen. And I ain't going to happen the next four minutes because he's only got four minutes left. 11 18 our sponsor much more important than whatever the hell he's going to say because it's going to be the same old tired crap. And they're going to go along with it. And whatever you say, see, Kyle and all other. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if he sticks that hand out like on our website there. I sure hope that what's in the name of the dog. Yeah, hope buddy is there going to be okay. I'm honored to welcome so many people who devote their lives to the well-being of others to the Rose Garden here in the White House. There are around 5 million hardcore users of the illegal drugs in America today. We must do. And we will do drugs. We must increase the floor drugs into America. This will make working in close cooperation with Mexico a priority. And we, and fathically disagree with those who favored respect for law, respect for others, and respect for themselves.

It didn't work We're a horn network. Remember that line when they were having lunch around there a shatheb� ons of whatever they're eating their Caesar salads But the bottom line is that this was just under pacify a client and has nothing really do go into a place where a lot of our people are going to be because it's a very highly specialized narrow focus kind of thing you see what I'm saying Focus focus it's very narrow and focused so the likelihood of any of our listeners being there and participating in buying any of our stuff or having any I do my guillars see it's one thing when you go on a paid deal Like the bill titles right and they look at you on a sandwich man Samutamani you know and they go get the free food and only banana of the beavers in there look at you like a hood how are you and That's one thing because you're getting paid to go there Right, oh, and it doesn't cost people to show up and meet greeting by their product when I'm in the middle Sidal thing right, you know like cheater wherever I'm going to blend up in exactly that's my point But in this particular case what we're trying to do is find a nice location where enormous numbers of our listeners might be fairly close and convenient So they can come there and donate to the charity and get some of our merchandise exchange and it's not at some highly Basically what I'm telling is that Miguel and Doreen between the two of them are sticking at deep in my Go and don't feel good.

Oh President I yield. Thank you Ted. Nice going baby Boy how much weight you think you need in this week He's starting to rival Marlon Brando how come he can't be present okay?

Some computer joint. I mean, I'm not not gonna affect they can enter convention But what kind of a place it reminds me of what how many times we were talking about this before the show today We were telling Scott about Times one we I would he said Alice been it after the Miami Beach convention Rebovers know where they have been started. There was nobody there how many times that we try to do that? It never ever works It never never ever works ever You got it We got it And it by the way because I shouldn't say this. Yeah, I think they're I don't think it's free to get in there ah So in other words we're sending him to a place where people who are going for a very specialized reason Have to pay any mission price to get it because you know if there was any chance I mean we're given away the prize field with Marlon tickets as hot as the Marlins are now It is many bandwagon jepres as we have in South Florida and you I mean just for that even if they didn't want to pick up any of our merchandise Just that alone we'd have a line spinning the wheel Seriously this this calls for a goddamn congressional investigation I we should tell Bush forget about this other bull crap. Okay. Let's start the checking on what's going on in a recueway I'm there needs to be an investigation. I think this is second only To the OJ golf tournament scandal. This is second only the bad We agree and all these that we've been raising money for charity IRB, but I think you're forgetting something And what is that? Don't care No, I didn't forget that. Now we have to do that and spy to them and spy to the man mismanagement there These are the same people who resent the fact that we've got a website that in one day gets more hits than they get in six years on areas Yeah, reasoned not fell from it not take pride in it not delighted the fact that it brings attention And we have a link to their our sports nerd website no Resented bitterly I think I'm playing the original kind of lesion. I wanted to our let me call some people here's West Palm Beach, hello Yes, sir pretty good.

I mean if you're gonna be like driving. Oh, it takes forever to get out of Florida And you're already in the really depressed mood. So why not make a stop at the Ocahumpa turnpike Plaza and go into Nathan's and get Again, oh 20 or 30 we years to go and maybe a little of the Mrs. Field's a chocolate chip cookies to across the way Go to Stinkies and get yourself some peanut brittle and then go to Stinkies and write all your teeth out with some and at 75 year old peanut brittle Boy, I can read that brings back some memories from a hundred years ago those stukies Some of my travels around the country he can log's oh Yeah, and after you that stukies you drop a he can log in the old and he pulled bowl 567.0560 pound five 60 So so in other words, that's it. This it was a wash out today the 20 bucks is probably always gonna get we can't even get to 24,000 much less to 25,000 Because we're hiding the merchant has been got Miguel locked away inside of a place that nobody can get into if they wanted to they got a paid to go inside Huh? What if you would have told me that before the show started today I would have done the show under the under the counter here. I would have just done the show on the flow. I know that's where he was going today He facts that to you Yesterday right all that I know about it. I didn't know and didn't I say to you earlier? I said in other words This is not the a van isn't gonna be he's gonna be inside someplace Remember right I do what this was all about yeah, he's inside the freaking convention center with a bunch of computer nerds Here's a call for Miami Buenos dias Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I think we ought to pay the pocket get into that building also probably know you do You gotta pay that park you got to pay to get in you got to be there for a specialized reason and we're sitting there with Miguel with his thumb up Is that's wondering how come we're not selling any merchandise unbelievable? Exactly crap Keep it up Neil thanks a lot. Thanks for the bad news. Thank you. Well, there's a guy with some more information and a good point to got a paid up park got a pay to get in But there hasn't bargains No comment because they're one of our fine sponsors here on your horrors station Anybody with up prostitution was illegal in the US hey, you're listening to a horridio Q.I.M We got around and when I'm up in Boca Tiga slapping all women with painted lifts around the pole. I listen to the new Rogers one to two In Preg�도 Me I'm a country, I love, I'll let America hit this on my throat Walk the goods and chat to you, no, my love Rummy, oh, you shiny, oh, pair of lovely, oh, way to run on my way Swat, Jan, oh, my post-cating staff Isn't it me watching balls, swat, and oh, my dad Come on with Christian brother, he'll make it off As I gain some home on Nicky, this is Jan, as grown Younger, and I'll do just like George's brain That's why I'm voted to me, you know In the tractor, I'll be his best husband, dad He's a craft feeling to live in a tree I'll be your favorite, love, you love, fucker He's a great guitarist, a perfect regalist And I'll believe in the perfect thing they should All right, one, two, a five, six, two, a wq, a much our gigantic mammoth one two hour So basically the big news of the day is three things Number one, a president went to the one and said, Eeeeh, nothing, please help us out Please, please bail us out because it's the right thing to do I didn't hear any, please, no, he said do it Number two is the court in California said, we want to have the election October 7 because it's the American FNWA And so they're going to do it October 7 And number three is, we got stuck in it and we're getting sabotaged Our fundraiser this year for all those poor little animals That's that to me is the big story that day For our super-seed and the other two I think you're still under the wrong assumption And what is that? Anybody in the station cares about our fundraiser Now see there's something you don't understand that is this What business does Dorine or any other nasty needle nose bitch in that radio station Have to do interfering with our ability to go out and raise money for the best of deal Did they help us to make the CDs? No, did they help us to get the goddamn key changed on? No, so you're still not understanding everything that Miguel does for us He does that the detriment of the things that they pay him to do over here Yeah, he does it on his own. So in order to, this is basically this is just one of those QAM things Like Joe and Mark are going to be Yodi Yodi Yodi Yodis And they're going to have the stuff with him And maybe somebody will be there to come buy The salespeople sell these ad packages They throw in van hits and appearances with Miguel and the van And the prize wheel is part of the package and it's Miguel's job What he gets paid for you see But you understand this is the way we've done it in past years And you're Alzheimer's kicking in past years And they would say to me Miguel would say Where do you want us to go today? We're going out. Where would you like us to go? When he's angry with us He would say, hey folks, where would you like the event today? In Kendall, I'm a day-land in Carl Springs somewhere Whatever on the days that he isn't scheduled to be somewhere else By whatever deal they've hatched back there Yeah, but see, I was always led to believe that this was one of our deals See, this is the best in the old fundraiser Is that what it looked like? No. I got the sheet running front of me, Mr. I'm wearing it. He's just tying it in. It says best of Neil today, I love it a lot of things They can be atty atty, atty, et cetera And spin the prize wheel from our lunchegets So this has nothing to do with us. We're just ancillary We're like an appendage. This is just the way to pacify a client Because some asshole sales person like you We promised him a bill of goods and we're going to do this And you'll be able to let Miguel's ass into all these other things And maybe look around his balls a little bit We're piggybacking our deal on two things We're piggybacking. Don't sound kosher to me, Mr. No. Pigskin is one thing with that football obsession Now this radio station piggybacking, that's another thing And I'd go a reen bitch. He'd like to piggyback Miguel I guarantee you that right now. She would claw his ass to pieces That bitch. If she could just get those pants unvocalled and untied man You'd never see that thing again She'd take her home as a souvenir What are you laughing about? You know it's the truth She'd claw that thing off with her damn fingernails Five six seven five sixty five sound a little bit Worked up excuse me okay, but we've been had again a QAM Always getting laid down a garden path But you hit it on the head you're right Sam I'm in denial.

From public beaches to carnivals to persons private vehicle, the legislation would make it more difficult as smokers to take a drag. I'm one of them faggotts. Post's morking us a smoking forces fear the ultimate goal of some lawmakers is the Bansigwethensigars completely in New York.

And I left after like the second-alance race. And I could it took me like a half an hour to find a car. You know, because a rental car, unless you really look at it close, you even know what that looks like. And it's like 20,000 car sitting out there outside the racetrack. And it took me a half hour to get out of there. Yeah, we went when he had horses. We met the car and we went there and uh, I know it's the old and the table and they're wonderful lights as a kid. There you go. He's causing the old abugas.

We'll just take it inside the building. Probably be a flat-footed tie. Here's the call from Fort Lauderdale. Good afternoon Neil. Yes sir, good afternoon to you. I might have an answer to you to your thing Neil. I know that day. Do you think it's a mother-button of Sian Denny's? What do you think, George? Your thing talks? Hello. Go ahead. George is trying to be a comedian. Go ahead Neil? Yes. Yes. It's not a funny divide. It's a mother-button of Sian. Sir, listen to me. Mother-button of Sian. Mother-button of Sian. It's a kind of a dessert that they serve at a particular restaurant, which I think it was taken ale, but maybe someplace else. Okay. All right. I misunderstood you. But getting back to what's called horse meat Neil, it was Ali Sheeb of a one-to-contecutive dairy that they brought over to Japan for breeding purposes. And when it's breeding, it's not actually, I guess, dry up to stuff. Right. Not a good stuff. They put them into what they call it. It's enough. And to the glue factory, and I was doing it really got the people in Kentucky. And they've actually signed a petition now that any champions, right, and all that. They go over to Japan for breeding purposes that they have a right to divide them back if they're going to go to the slaughterhouse. That's what's caused a big problem over there. And you're going to write on the head. Originally from Boston, Neil, and Greg and Zyte's dream is the best. Especially when you sprinkle those Jimmy's on there. I'll see it Quincy Market. 560560. How I always say, like, little things like that at the end. It's like, yeah. And then I wonder, why did I say that inside? Some people will. And I go, why? That I waste my time doing it. Well, the 30 people that get it. 560560. So we got $23,490. Now, how do you like that, Mr. Hachah? Good. Got Almighty. It's just embarrassing. And you're right. It's hard to admit it. See, and a Q and I OD was no different either. It was different on this as far as the fundraiser because the whole station was involved. It was station. But in terms of anything that the station couldn't make a buck on, and what immediately comes to mind is those glorious vagus trips. The Bob Lincoln. Oh, yeah. Talk about being left in the lurch. Hang out to dry. Thanks a lot Bob Green. You little smuck. You little pusala. See, they didn't care. They wouldn't get involved. Well, you wanted to do what you know. It's his problem. You know, why to do it. And basically, because they couldn't make a profit on it, the station wouldn't lift a finger to do anything that extricate us from that nightmare of Bob Lincoln and those vagus trips. Oh, not one. But two, not having learned my lesson the first time because I'm a schmuck. Remember that? I did. I did. Damn, you're, damn, you're putting in a pine box because of the stress of that. And once again, but they don't care. They don't care about doing anything for the community or for the audience. They'll put on a front up. Oh, well, we're going to have a golf tournament. How many dollars to go really wide of go to the charity? About 30 minutes golf tournaments. Who the hell are they kidding? Just like just like that golf course. What's what they'll golf course? Was it you remember you won't? And I won't either because I hate golf. I remember they were outraged and they sent me that letter and they said, We're going to copy this screw-and-win it. Can about the OJ thing and they were all, I'll write. And then, you know, like two weeks later, oh, and QAM is going to be a such and such golf. They were right back. They're sucking each other's ass again. You know, they don't care. Finding anybody. It's really going to be principles or stands on principle. Man, you could find one in a billion. I forget about. I saved that letter. Did you? That's somewhere. It'll go get you. Well, look, look, I'm on the board. I'd like to find out that any of that golf course again because Bob had a bunch of two-faced phony bastards they were. There were sucking screw-ands ass about two weeks after that indignant letter. And we were outraged and Mr. Rout and then I talked about on the ear and they were like long gone. I'm putting it in the fax machine right now. Oh, you got it? Good. Excellent. Let me rip them and ask, too. Maybe I can help screw-and-lose an account. I'd love to do it, screw-and anything I could do to help you lose money, and take sleep out of your life. Maybe I have a few sleepless nights rolling and turning and twisting in the anking, although I'm sure you'd unplenty of that. Which team is she going to be doing that with? Roy! Here's some rise, hello. Neil, how you doing? Pretty good? I'm a French silk pie. I mean, that's a dessert that's made in a lot of the turns, but I don't know. You see you did a lot of the bishy-in. I might have taken what you. That's his phony. He's breaking up. Your phone is breaking up real bad. Well, I'm sorry, is that better? A little better, yeah. Yeah, I used to eat it at big boy. And I was thinking maybe that's where you used to have it. No, I have big boys to me. The strawberry pie was the famous thing for big boy. Lies, brothers, not just in Michigan, but everywhere. In fact, there's one on the Davy Road extension. Yeah, well, no, there's a shone there. I don't think there's a big boy. Oh, that's right, shoneies. But shoneies was big boy, also shoneies and a lies brother's big boy. Well, they still have a lies, but there's up a Michigan. And I used to get it there all the time. So I was thinking maybe because you were a Michigan used to get it there. Now, I'm thinking it's off-floor to the basically it's steak and ale, which I don't even know if they're in business anymore, steak and all. These are pretty good place. There's a steak and ale still on commercial just west of the term pie. I can still there. Okay. So, okay. Well, sorry. I thought it might have been big boy. I'll see you in Lafagna. Okay. Take care. Skiper's table. What I was with those of the days, man, when men were men, Wolverine harness raceway. Jack, race, Connor races. Tarness racing in the evening. And the president he afternoon driving between one track and the other. How did he like that, George? Oh, I like it a lot. Oh, my fast paper is messed up. Oh, I mean, damn it. I don't want to let me do the break. Not better, I've straightened up. Might be something important. Oh, I'm trying to do something important because it's whatever the thing is you were facts. You see, that was an active God probably. Oh, good. To get my attention to the facts machine real quick, because aren't you facts me that thing and the thing is jammed up again. Okay. Oh, the break. I just refuses to come through probably the QAM block. Probably they be easily. They put the block on the line to make sure I can't get a hold of that thing. 20 till 2 a QAM.

Oh, she's gonna get you. I was in trouble the first time Norma Kent brought me for the tour of the building after I signed a contract with Beesley Greed, broadcasting, and we walked through that building, a real toilet, the carpets were like, yeah, all milledude all the salt running with mong and cumb and crap on it. And I walked through there and I see on the walls of two offices screw and when it car sales managerists and Philist, so whatever, I don't even know what her life name is. Don't even say it. I see all these pictures of OJ and I'm thinking of myself, are these people crazy and then come to find out that they're like big groupies because anybody was a jackstrap. Oh, you see, that's part of the whole sickness of the radio station, the whole concept of this sort of incentive obsessive like, we reasonably not obsessed not, you know, over the line, got to a lot of ball games, hockey games, you know, like your average ordinary bag, I mean guy, but there's something really, really there's an element far beyond which we've ever been exposed to before before we came to QM, I think you would be the first to agree with that. Yeah, an element of sorts like neurosis that even Freud would have been shocked and dismayed with. Yeah. Anyway, here's that letter from Machu Picard, the general manager of the Lago Mar Country Club in plantation, no less. And about the blind sighting us with OJ Simpson and on second thought you just played light was, and Yadi Adi Adi and we were surprised and very reluctant host and your strategy to get him on a property was underhanded but effective and you're coming to me that all publicity is good publicity may hold true for radio station, but not for a country club. The only protection we have from a recurrence when dealing with these seatful people is not to deal with them. Therefore, WQM will not be welcome back at a Lago Mar. Additionally, Lago Mar will in the future rectal advertising dollars away from QM. This was dated October 1st, 1999. I think since then they've had a few tournaments. I've heard of that. But QM out there could be wrong about that, but I'm things to tell you now. Because I know we're like almost immediately after this that the smoke past maybe maybe ESC went out there personal, you know, and kiss some wood, I mean Tiger's wood and you know, made up and kissed. But I'm going to save this for my file for my diarrhea because this is really special. This is really choice just to go to show you. The kind of crap that they pull for anybody listening who's like a relatively new listener, we're doing a fundraiser. And I absolutely, because I despise golf and I know that most of those golf tournaments very, very little of the money goes to the charity anyway. I don't want to get involved. Oh, no, it's going to be great. Baba, Baba, and they were just using us so they could get in and once again using the charity as a way to, you know, siphon money out of the golf club and to go in there and pitch a whole big song to dance. And Tracy Caracito, who worked with us at WID in those days with the promotion director and I told him specifically and you said, and I knew the witness. Yes. If OJ is coming, we don't want anything to do with it. Oh, no problem. He's not going to be there and we promise you when we swear up and down and that's the only way they got us to go along with getting involved in a golf tournament for center one for charity at that time. Right. They like to hit. Come to find out behind the scenes. Here's Greg Reed, here's Scran, here's San the promotion man. Back in those days, the dearly departed San, the illegal alien woman, Heli, came from Venezuela, but have been a banana on his knee and they're pulling all the strings and setting up for OJ to fly down there, paying for the plane tickets and they're got the limo to pick him up and bring him to the golf tournament. San puts him on the phone, tries to put him on the air with me that day. Then you had a stroke on the air that day over that. Couldn't believe it. Couldn't believe it. And then of course, I'll try to lie their way out of it, made San the sacrificial lamb and fired his ass. And of course, he just didn't show up again. San the one day he disappeared. What? San the lamb. San the lamb. Not that anybody shen any tears over that because he never looked at a finger anyway, but nevertheless. And that should have told us everything we needed to know about Greg Reed, measly weed broadcasting, screw-in, when it can a whole concept of really going out and getting involved in the community, raising money for charity, doing something positive that you really don't have to do, just because you want to do something. Yeah, like that. But what does it have to do with sports? What does it have to do with sports? What does it have to do with making us any money? Any profit to keep the beeslies off his ass? And the answer is nothing. No. I'm going to head it now from this whole deal. You know? I just can't believe it. You can knock me over with a feather, just to right now. One of these days, I'm going to get you. Just like, oh, gee, I'm going to get you. I'm just going to sit here. You're not going to have any idea how long I can sit here in a way that I can. No long time, Mr. Leave you me. I'm very good at that. I'm just staring out the window. It's a beautiful day by the way. The sun shining. It looks really nice and fighting. Place for a nice lunch in a few minutes about seven to be exact. Who's counting? But holy, Toledo. What a bunch of rapers. That's what we have a QM man. Rap, no wonder most talking about rap all the time. Because it's a plate is a rape place. Like it says in that sign on the wall, right to your right. Just give us the effin money. That's all. Just give us the effin money. Like I was talking about yesterday, the client feedback sheets. And they looked at that. And they looked at me like I was like, I was a crazy person. Are you out of your mind? Because you're on a note, the clients are getting results from your show. I mean, you must be a crazy person. We don't play that game here at QAM. Like today that we had the threat of that hurricane and Brian Norr cross was under hyperventilating and scourine. And I'm desperately asking, well, we're doing these spots. But are some of these people like open today? Are these restaurants open? I mean, because Mayor Pingu Piccini was on a year of screaming in the yellow and everybody should like batten down the hatches. But I was the hurricane that went up to Palm Beach and never hit a couple of years ago. But I hope it won't work. And meanwhile, behind our backs, Grant was telling the sales department, oh, don't call your clients because then they'll cancel their spots today. Remember that? Of course I do. Like it was yesterday. Just give us the money. We don't care if you're going to do any business today or not. We don't care if your spots are going to be effective. But you just got a contract there. Give us the effin money. It's in hand it over, man. It's like a stick up. You know what they, well, you know those things that they put on a wall called stick stick clear to the stench? That's what that's what it is. There's a stench of stick up. This is a good idea. First stick up. So while you people listen like I said before, when I said freeze, it's a stick up. Okay. Yeah. Right through your guy named Speaker. Man, am I worked up about that guy named bogus thing with that scrowan and Miguel and Dorian. Scrowan wasn't even involved. And that must he probably was. He probably had her finger in it. Can you imagine? I don't know about it. 155 and 560 QA by now you've been here to talk about Laminates Arrest and how Laminated would flooring from Laminates Arrest is the easy to smart little man and Salt and the natural wood flooring which is nice but mighty expensive.
