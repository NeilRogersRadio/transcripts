Just a cute little thing It's a bad story no other people don't listen when you're on you think that's a cute story The cute story effect me was the one about pelling the drug year the paraphernalia That's not cute that's nauseating. No, it's real cute How do the USA right now, which I'm not very delighted not to be Federal authorities charged 55 people with trafficking in illegal drug paraphernalia And an investigation they said targeted the nation's biggest internet distributors of marijuana bombs Cracked pipes and other drug abuse gear You know one time I fashioned a roach clip out of a paper clip Oh It's amazing what some guys can do with a coke can you know what yeah, I use that to In coordinated raids on Monday meaning yesterday Officials confiscated thousands and thousands of tons of paraphernalia from companies boasting up to $50 million in annual sales said Mary Beth Buchanan US attorney in Pittsburgh whose office is leading the operation pipe dreams investigation along with a DE A No one would possibly use these items for smoking tobacco became said it's just a department news conference We know what you're doing with them and we know what you can do with it too for that matter Mary Beth Attorney General John Ascroft said the sale of drug paraphernalia has exploded on the internet Making it easier for teenagers in young adults to buy it The items are often disguised as such things as lipstick cases to escape detection and are marketed under code names and symbols Hmm, quite simply the illegal drug paraphernalia industry has invaded the homes of families across the country. It's invading out their knowledge Ashcroft said There's shoving in your door why you're not paying any attention They're dropping it into the chimney Santa Claus that's a behind-a-Christmas time Organizations abocating legalization marijuana accused asked Croft of grandstanding and of course Are we on a shadow of a doubt? At a time and arrested the countries worried about terrorism this attorney general is going after people who sell pipes Said Keith Straubt the founder of the National Organization for the reformer marijuana laws normal surely has something better to do with his time like maybe dress up those naked stashes a big good key Yeah Even needle men executive director the drug policy alliance against a debuster ended scoring political points against a perceived Counter culture I saw the movie over the weekend. I can't think of the name of it about Lyndon Johnson about the part of his presidency where he You really did the award and be it, no Okay, and just like this president listen to all of the wrong people or at least most of the wrong people Do you know how many American servicemen and women died in Vietnam? I don't know the grand total 88,000 58,000 that's a lot for what was there any reason that they died? No, well, did they harm you as this being there? Yeah, those godless common right we had to stop them that even mr. Macnamara believed it at the end Oh mr. Macnamara and in fact, it will be was really more about Bob Macnamara than I was about Lyndon Johnson, but in any way And anyway, 58,000 and I thought to myself There must be a reason why they're showing this movie now and obviously the room You think it's been? Everybody's all up at arms about the 97 people who died in the nightclub in Rhode Island, right? Which it was a tragedy and the seven astronauts who died on the Columbia which is a tragedy and The people who died in Chicago and at nightclub, but 58,000 Right young people died, you know if they said 50,000 came back in body bags, but a total of at least 58,000 were killed for nothing Right not to count the thousands and thousand I mean hundreds of thousands of innocent men women and children Who died in Vietnam on both sides right But it was worth it and of course it was worth nothing. It was just a total waste of human life We stopped communism and and at the time You know when you think back to those times then of course Nixon came in just at the time when they finally a Johnson was starting to see the era of his ways Right and decided not to run again because he knew the jig was up and Then Nixon comes in and prolong the war for another four years Yeah, but we could kill a whole bunch more people and get that total up to 58,000 Are you ripping the Republicans again and and during those times? Well, I didn't know Lyndon Johnson was Republican no And during those times all of the protesters just like we see now were labeled unpatriotic Comi sympathizers Hanoy Jane all of this crap Harvey Spoko hit his senseless killing senseless contrived killing coward And here we're going through the same thing all over again today All the finger pointing assholes all the bloodthirsty morons all the people too stupid to read and the fact that we had a couple of calls yesterday about that front line show I'm really depressed because I went online to try to figure out when it held it's on again I can't find it really I didn't look I can't find when I let Dan show his on again I want about the the origin of the chicken hox decision to go in there and do a do this thing years and years ago And how Clinton interrupted it was you know a tackless interruptus is what it was For eight years and that's what it worked over time to get his ass out of there so they could get their hands on a controls again And carry out their evil plans their evil scheme and they will that's what they're doing while the rest of the people are sleeping Lotion vatual ret and joe made in air And those people who are making effort those people are out there demonstrating in the streets and the young people and that like I said before It's good to see a lot of these people are your own people.

What is it? And nephew relatives to school or something like that? Which is mighty why yeah, I've gone through all that when I was living with my sister She you know she had four kids for little daughters so I got lots of practice about you know changing girly diapers Which is a good thing it turns out that I have lots of practice Changing those Never never changed a male child because I was you know I have Nefus but they always live somewhere else you got to watch out for the yeah, no, and I've seen I know I've been a witness to that phenomenon, but thank god knock on well, you know Whatever talk on wood.

I don't find anything weird about that. I know lots of people. I mean just the regular thing. I mean even in the old and days When I was so poor that I really I mean there's no lie. I couldn't swing shaving cream. You know when you're on a budget and you're living off of ramen six for a dollar Hey, that's radio. That's radio. You wanted to get into radio. That was my My life on radio. I can't afford shaving cream if I want to eat so I'm just gonna put soap on my face and just scrape this really dull Razor across it That's what they they sell shaving mirrors that go in the shower fog free right first of all There was one already in there when we bought the house and we had the bathroom remodeled and there's a the women The women in the family they put mirrors in the in the bathroom All the times I didn't put it in there that that you need it because I've shaved without one I mean you're a business fire. You know you don't know you don't you know where your face is You know where all the parts are you run your hand along your face you can tell where the stubble is Yeah, you miss like one little All right, every once in a while, but you know what you do that when you're shaving with a mirror too You don't notice that and then you like other the chin. There's a big streak I missed a streak so what are these just all cranks are We know an answer to them. I know you're talking now. I just didn't know right know what the rule right I just I was just I was talking about the French and Andy really had some things to say about that But I don't want to make these people wait they might have something to say hello Q. I am Yeah, yes, you are Q. I am hello What just blown out real quick? Yeah, yeah, you're making out shame Oh my also wish my Jesus is your Okay, I don't you don't do that. I don't do that.

Fort Laudidad Yeah, me again. Tabernier. Hello. Hey George. Not you again. Hello. Good morning. How are you? I've been I'm guilty. I'm in shaving in a shower all my life. I don't even use a mirror. I didn't think it was an issue No, you get you get a nice moon. I get a smoother shave in a shower than I do anywhere. I thought it was just a time-shaving A time-shaving thing Well, that's how I started but then I've been doing it on my life and I use a mirror. In fact, when I do use soap and I use the mirror, I cut the heck out of myself Right, and not only is it time-saving, but it's mess-saver because if you're shaving in the sink Which I occasionally do look if I have to go out in the evening or something I'm not gonna take another shower necessarily You've got all the stubble in the sink that you got to wash out of there and the shower, you know, everything is going down the drain like everything else Well, I found out you have much much smoother shave, but one of the reasons I called was You know, you see at the day you were saying something to sick of hearing him about terrorism and all the stuff Yeah, the one thing I'm sick of hearing is getting the lookout for suspicious characters. Oh, yeah, well I mean, we're having the work I like how they're saying to silence and everybody's strange right I would I would use the analogy that they're treating us like children, but I don't know any adult that that Insults their child's intelligence like that Yeah, look after suspicious characters like what we live in south Florida when aren't we looking for suspicious characters and how and when aren't we seeing them? Right, I think I'm seeing the world largest open airing Right, I'm looking at the most suspicious character you've ever seen right now All right, anyway, have a good day As you understand, Carlos? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. Be on the lookout for suspicious characters. Okay I found one. That what do I do? So I'm done with my shower now and I really didn't take all along You really you're done with your shower a nice hot shower It's all right, so we don't have so many times shaving not already shaved earlier not only do you have a record breaking a VM talent But you can take a shower faster than that I can get my pants off and it wasn't a rush like just running under the Right rain drops. It was a nice relaxing hot shower Huh, because I know how to do it man. No, where do you get so many things done in the course of the day? That's right When you have as little time left as I do as some of us right we don't waste any of it hurry on through it For example, yeah, oh that's right. I guess I'm playing the case Tom Lavin and Joe Prieto of Hallot Potty at GMC are proud to announce three great Neo Rogers Neil deals so I want to put your ear right at the radio especially on this station and my crack a little bit Neil deal number one get zero percent fine in signal GMC 1500 series pickups You heard me right zero percent at all 1500 series pickups Neil deal number two Lisa GMC on void for just 299 bucks a month plus tax for 48 months That's correct you're in the numbers right only 299 a month plus tax and Neil deal number three by your apati ag vibe For just 199 bucks a month.

Not that I might have put a weight to hold. I bet the size of a beard and beard. And a twist with feet looms my man friend. I'll just make up with generous on me. And then ask him to break my bun. No, there you know the again. So I would not feel the most old. And I would not be ashamed about a ginger and more gay union. Just hold him and stroke him away. Or make a weird that might bite. Just sound like a mind your own kiss. Only a macho men die. You don't notice that makes me flip my wig. If ginger was a lover of mine, I'd bury my bulbous baby now. Inside is simply rare and... You know I would not be a sport-boat. No! If I was not a closet to face, That's why a ginger and more gay union would make me feel pity in gay. Everybody follow my thousand goals. Yeah ginger and more gay union. Would make my sorrow bowie as pure state. If we had a ginger and more gay union, Then he wouldn't have to get me raped. Now you're watching a story on CNN about his little girl who filled up here The guy shot. No, I was a stolen MSBC. Snowball fight. Snowball fight outside of school filled up here. And the kids are, you know, throwing snowballs on the girls back and forth. Yeah, and a lot comes to one of the daddies, and he gets pissed off, you know, like it. He gets his name a limiter and all of a sudden, the girl is in critical condition. Over Snowball fight. And stunned. And Leon Harris and the other broads that's on their own CNN are act like, Oh, this is just incomprehensible. This is in a country where people blow each other's brains out of our parking spot. Right? Over parking spot. And they're saying, oh, Snowball fight is if it's so incomprehensible that people should each other, you know, over nothing, which happens all the time. Grow test gun unacceptable. Here's the fact that this should also give an idea about the warm, warm feeling, give broadcasting in South Florida. Okay. Just heard about your lost dog, which one was it? It was tiny because the other one we had put to sleep 14 months ago, so I guess by process of elimination, it was tiny. Ocean is saying, elimination. Sorry, tiny. As a fellow dog owner, please accept my sympathy. On a lighted note, I had my first ride to Corvette, what an awesome car, stay well. And you want to know why this is so emotional? Why is that? It's unsigned. Well, as a fellow dog owner, please accept my sympathy. You can't get much more personal and emotional than that, can you? That's the South Florida F and Way right there. They couldn't even make up a fake name. That's what I'm saying. Could have said, Joan David, Mode, Emma Howard David, Could have said anything. Well, the one I just said you was signed. Oh, it's not a condolent act, but it's okay. You can view the front, oh, this is John Portie Lucy. You can view the front line program online, oh, the ASU can't see that. And he's got the thing here, but I don't want to go through all of that. I just wanted to know when it's on the ear again, so I can sit back and relax and I have to view it on my computer. Didn't they say Wednesday? Did we have a conference? But I looked on a schedule. I don't see it Wednesday at 9 o'clock, or at any other time tomorrow. If anybody can tell me if it's on again, you know, like people who have a TV guide or have or actually watch TV, it'd be much appreciated. Specialists, we have all these call. There is a one call on the board. No. So, like I said, now that you're doing a show, there's a one call on the board. Maybe that's why. They thought I'd do it in the show. They all turned out right. Here's the poll. 229 votes. I'd rather croaked in vote of vote for George W. Bush 106 than vote for Hillary 62 than by a Michael Jackson CD 25. Listen to more Howard David at only 20. Well, he's small potatoes. He's really falling. Watch another Mike Tyson fight 10, or I'd rather croaked in drive a Mustang. 6. 6 of us discerning discriminating people, say we'd rather croaked than drive a child. I mean, would you write a tricycle back home after work? Well, if somebody stopped making my car payments, I wouldn't have much choice. Well, that's a good point. Well, let's work on it. Let's see how it works out for it. I'll take a scooter. Sodom is seeing using prostate groups to attack the US from the Washington Times, from our friend Lensangles website. Thank you, Lynn. Our recent CIA analysis concluded Sodom is saying is highly likely to use a thin-fifth of the US. A recent CIA analysis concluded Sodom is saying is highly likely to use a third-party terrorist group to conduct a proxy attack on the US in advance of American military operations according to US officials. And it goes on to say somewhere in the storyfifth I can find it, which it's a... Not very long, but it's it goes on. That possibly here it is. US intelligence officials said that the recent reports that Sodom would try to use has vola. The Iranian-backed terrorist group. That wasn't at our own BDI Bobby Graham. Many, many, many weeks ago that was screaming about that. Yeah. And about how come we're worried about Sodom when we got his vola. We got all these terrorist groups, that's just L-Cat about all these others. Running on loose all over the country. And nobody's doing anything about it. Right? There we are. I just mentioned that in past. You start now, again. On speaking of Vietnam, which I did before, where she had no comment about. I just don't know what it is with the people of South Florida. They're like, all brain dead, is that what it is? Well, for starters. I mean, we have 58,000 people die for nothing. Those were Americans who died for nothing. That's much and all the others. Right? And I guess they don't count. 58,000 people have a short memory. Have they were protecting America? They weren't protecting any interest of Arza. That of course, the World Cup is in the rubber companies. But other than that, the Catholic Church. But other than that. Yeah. For nothing. And the protesters were all labeled anti-American and scumbags. And Tommy Pinko, long-haired, liver, belly, yellow belly, whatever. And the same things going on now. This is a follow-up to the story about that lady basketball player that turns the other way to in Montface to Flag when they play the anthem. Yeah, there's been more. Of Vietnam, veteran came out of the court. Sunday held in Merckon Flag in front of Manhattanville, senior forward Tony Smith. After the vision tree play, again refused to face the flag during the National Anthem. She disgraced herself as she disgraced the flag since Yuri Kali 56 of often counting the York, who was ejected from the arena. After he walked on to the court during the first break in play, they showed this on news last night. They showed him marching out there and like stirring her down. Kali approached Smith as she lined up on other player prepared to shoot free throws. He was escorted out of the GM by school security and local police. As she has done all seasons, Smith turned 90 degrees away from the flag as the anthem was played prior to tip-off. Six of her teammates stood at attention with her hands on their chests. While three other teammates stood with her heads bowed and their arms at their sides, Smith declined to be interviewed after the game. That'll teach her a thing or two. Although he's got an excuse if he had an ompet, maybe he was one of those other thousands of thousands who came back, whose brains were fried. I just mentioned that in passing too. So wasn't just a 58,000 who died. Right. Hundreds of thousands of other people in their families and loved ones, whose lives were destroyed, ruined forever. Thanks to a just insane, unbelievably unacceptable piece of crap. And there's another reason you should watch a board on the 4th of July, which is a true story. Because it's all about that. About the ones that came back and what was here they had a version without time cruising. And telling it's his best acting job ever. Really? Shocking even better than bossy business? Yes. Shocking. Hey, they had to hold the gun to my head to make me watch it. Here's a call from Western. Hello. A lot of people. That was it. That was a mentally ill material. Hey. So I'm going to just reach over and down the rock. And with sound a much better. I wasn't too bad. I give up on eight and a half. Here's Miami. Hello. New God. Speaking. Good morning, New. Okay. Good morning, George. Hey, how are you? First up, I'd like to say, Mike, I don't want to touch a puppy. Sorry, you are. The other thing is that I hear you're coming up on your 27th anniversary. Yeah. Congratulations, my friend. I want to give you a good. I know that it's literally about that. You haven't seen about that girl. Not wanting to face her flag. Isn't that a little ridiculous? I mean, I don't have a problem with people doing that. I mean, why are they making such a big deal about it? We're burning the flag for, you know, right? That's right. Because it's something for all these other militant assholes to get bent out of shape about it. So they have to sing on her out. And, you know, all these great Americans who supposedly understand what freedom is all about. They have to like abuse her because she's exercising her rights. Yeah, I don't get that. You know, I myself asserted to use my military. And I consider myself somewhat thinking, you know, picture-wise individually, even though I'm about as well as you can get. Um, the other thing is that you talked about, oh, Vietnam. I don't trust Bush going to war. I don't support the war really because I don't just Bush. I think you got other concerns to others. You know, he got money concerns. He wants that oil over there as far as I'm concerned. I don't trust Bush. Money more. You see, you said the two magic words that duck didn't come down, but you said the magic words money and oil. Yep. You know, exactly. Well, you haven't been there. Okay, thank you. Thank you. What is it, guy? Military guy? Yeah. He doesn't support the war. It doesn't trust his president. He sees two. What do you see is what it's all about? Well, I got to do the break. Oh, it's a good thing I didn't show her right. That's fine. And probably should remove my recoil off from my mouth doing this fine. And then, D. And just like yesterday, you saw the thousand times better after the shower. Right. Well, that's because I inhaled the hot fumes in here. Unfortunately though, I didn't fart. Oh, God, I would have loved. Oh, man. There is nothing out of care. What anybody says. I'll underfall the cronkights. I've done that. Forted real bad in the shower and a hot spring. I got my ass to the curb. And inhaled it right. Wow, what a high. Hey, home orders is there anything worse than venturing out to your backyard for a swim. Looking at that once beautiful pool of yours and saying, Oh, my God, what happened here? Oh, my God. It's stained. It's dirty. It might be cracking. Well, you don't have to look at that mess anymore.

Bright in the eyes in the wildhouse doing all is presidential bed. He's there in the oval office though is not sure what an oval is. He's practicing a speech that he's been working on for weeks should be a breeze. But it's not for a man who thinks that if you're from a random or irrelease. Saturday he's still no spot of things what's in the center of Central Gold. You could say his brain is useless kind of like the Chinese clock up ventricles. Now he goes to give the speech with words his boat can't reach he looks up. But he won't tell you how he feels instead. He'll talk about some bad mistakes he'll make. He can't spell he can't act. He can't speak. So what he says so isn't out. Don't have a clue. Don't bring it in to him. So he just babbles on. Babbles on. If he said that alone. If I was 60 WCM sir about that the drop in there it headed in queue and so why you know play part of it right. Well you heard it. I enjoyed it right. I thought you wanted to what it was what I'll even share with you because I thought it was going on with that so just like the first one if we'd had a little bit more you know a little bit early morning. But I'll check it on the web. Of all the bedtime stories we have today this could be the most interesting US plans for our industry after Sodom speaking to that last caller. This is from the Houston Chronicle. Peace protesters are pointing through the streets. The UN Security Council continues to squabble and the US has yet to decide whether to war in Iraq or they decided. While so much about a second Persian Gulf war reigns uncertain the bush of interest rate is busy planning what Iraq's oil in this be might look like after Sodom was saying. The Pentagon already has scoped out Iraq's oilfields hoping to force all any order for the Sodom to towards the nation's crude wealth. The US State Department's future of Iraq's office has been soliciting input from free Iraqis on a range of economic and social issues and the White House is considering he'll be in charge of the second largest in the world whether an American might soon be running Iraq's oil sector remains unclear. It's fuzzy. They're wiping off the crystal balls. But this much seems certain the White House is considering a radical recreation of Iraq's government and economy. And I think we all have a feeling we know where they're going to be sticking at hose. Yeah. They all seem to be. They're going to stick it to the hose. How's that pull coming Neil? I'd rather croak than 271 votes than vote for GW Bush 129 vote for Hillary 69. Didn't make it up. All the numbers changed again. Like I said, 70. Fire Michael Jackson CD 34. Listen to him how are David at 25. Your small potatoes won't even care about you anymore. They have bigger face to fry. I'd rather croak than watch for another Mike Tyson fight 12 and drive a mustang six. You're going to take that call from your red lines or or by. Hello. Or. Yes sir. Here. Hello. Yes I am. I worry. Okay. Sorry, here by the dog. Thank you. Got a cat that's in the summer of situation and epileptic cat. Ooh. I have to commend you sir. I've actually attended a hearing. I attempted to call a couple of other radio talks. Much much more right wing than than what you do. You're the first person that I've heard at all mentioned the similarities between all the the bulkwrap that were being pounded with right now regarding this. Fort coming war. I'm going to be a non veteran by the way. I'm very proud of it. You're the first person to mention the similarities between all the crap that we're hearing now about. Oh, we're going to save these people and free their country and all this crap. That's the same shit and the same stuff. Excuse me. I heard in the 60s. And I can listen to them in the army and I went overseas. To do just that. I believed in that war. We sure did a wonderful job for them. Yeah. We lost 50,000 plus guys and everything's exactly the way it was. And the friendship, by the way, we're smart enough. That time to get the hell out of you. And after all those years, the French finally gave up. They came up and they took out a dodge and we go in there. Yeah. So I mean, I don't know how I feel like this war. I'll be very frankly, I'm sure that I believe it. I'm sure that I don't believe in it. What's about to happen. Well, the interesting thing is that it started out as regime change. And then when that became unpalatable, it became, he must eliminate all of his weapons of mass destruction. He doesn't have any weapons of mass destruction now that we know of that. He didn't have two years ago and five years ago and ten years ago and twelve years ago. And most of what he does have, he got from us in the first place. Yeah. True. So, you know, it's just as transparent as that business about Afghanistan and Taliban. And once the Afghan pipeline deal fell through. And they were no longer our buddies because they were hiding and protecting Osama, Yamama. And we had to eliminate them and get there at the Skum bags out of this. So we could recindole Afghan pipeline, which like I mentioned, we're getting that deal started up again now. It has nothing to do with people being oppressed and about wanting to free anybody. We don't give a crap about freeing anybody. Well, this government doesn't care about freeing the people in the US today. They don't give a crap about other people being free. My core crap. I have the freedom. And I've been there and I've seen it. And how many people is this administration? Will are all these chicken hocks? How many lives are they willing to sacrifice of innocent people so they can get their hands on a Iraqi? Or, let's question everybody in this country ought to be asking right now. Well, how many innocent people have to die to make these people happy? Okay. One of the interesting things about this presidency is that the people who are making the decisions have never seen dead bodies die. Right. I have. I have. Lots of them. Right. And it's sad. But you know what I say? Let then go over and fight the war. I agree. Okay. Have a great day. Thank you. Let then go over and fight it all the chicken hocks. Romsfeld and the wolfowitz and Pearl and Libby and G.W. and Dick Taney. Let's then go over there and leave the charge. Didn't saw them challenge into a debate. How about all this? I agree. We got that. Sautam challenges. Boasted debate. I saw it on Dan Ratherl. I just put it on Russell or something. Can you just imagine that? And of course, every fly sure right well. Oh, oh, oh, oh, we're not going to do that. Time for debating is over. They're going in. In two or three weeks. It doesn't. And that should that should anybody who's still on the fence who has any doubts. That should be the only message you need to know. Every time Hans Blix says, well, you know, we really didn't find this and we, they really don't have that. And these missiles only go 15 miles beyond where the supposed to go, which is hardly worth blowing up the world for. We don't like that. And then we make some other crap up. And we just keep making stuff up and making stuff up and all, well, they might have this, they might have that. And come clean. We know you're not coming clean. How those ghost ships coming. Oh, they're out there somewhere, man. I don't think we have a ghost of a chance to find them, but they're out there somewhere. He'll come this morning. And we're carrying all those phyocinical weapons and all those, uh, uh, uh, uh, all of that, all of these things, nerve agents. Right. And if that's the way that we had before. Which I don't doubt is true. But when you're back, I'm<|ko|><|ko|> to tick to the wall. That he's going to like unleash whatever directions he's getting. Here with his belong. Hamas and whoever else, how many innocent people are going to have to die in this country? Right. Because of the fact that these people, Wal我們.

So playing a lot of more bits. Some good passes here. Mark says a couple of things. If yet now more was thought by a young rural and... What is it, say? I don't know something. Urban poor minorities over nothing. I lost one cousin in the war and another to suicide upon his return. My hand out was considered a bad American for to find the warmongers. Now he's a world hero. To me, Cliff wrote a great song called Vietnam. Maybe George is heard of it. No. What's next, Mark? Now we know what's next, Mark. We're just hoping it's not as bad as it might be. I thought something about the French chef. I didn't know if you were interested, but I can't pronounce his name. About why? The French chef. Lois-so? Okay. The committee turned on the side of fame. Chef Bernard Luzos and shockwave nation-wide today. And spark condemnation from fellow killer and masters of acute France's all-powerful food critics of pushing him over the edge. Lois-so 52 was found dead yesterday in the bedroom of his home in Salud. There was three U.S. star coat the ore restaurant in France's Burgundy region east of Paris. A rifle was found by his side police were investigating the cause of death. However, employees and family were suggested he had committed suicide. The new set the gastronomic world in the morning. And became the leading topic of the French media. It also spark debate about the merits of restaurant guides waiting systems, as which chefs awaited your OIC-wide code himself. He maintained his top rating of three stars in the 2003 edition of the benchmarked Michelin-REGIDE. However, he lost two points going from 19. Hey. There he is. Going from 19 to 17 in the twenty-point rating system of the Grat Milou. That guy is in prestige in power in recent years. He said, if I lose the star, I'll kill myself. Said another three stars Chef Jacques-Limwood, who has a restaurant in Shagley and Salud, a region. Oh, God. I can't stand a French man. Can't stand it. No. I mean, they're not full of anybody with this whole business about their position. See if they were doing it from the right standpoint, you know, would have some credibility. Right. But they never met a terrorist they didn't like. They do a lot of business with Sodom, including Salum, the plutonium, for the nuclear reactor. These really had to store in the first place. Hmm. And, you know, just like the Russians who do a lot of business with the Iraq, they got the right opinion for the wrong reason. That's the right one. Nevertheless, never, nevertheless is right. Because one thing I will say, we ought to shut over that. French people piss me off. Great art pigs. I don't like to generalize, but in this show, we always make an exception on this show. The French art pig, yes, I'll say, I'll push off. And if you don't believe us, this go to Hollywood Beach. Oh. Mike, our chronic facts are my system of Vietnam, vet and still can't believe that 58,000 died for nothing. I almost made that list several times. We made it back to the USA in one piece he says. It did make me an angry person, change me forever. Today's people don't have any idea what the world is all about. Thanks to you, I do get to laugh and smile sometimes. Thanks to my PS, the movie Platoon, Messers Beup, every time I watch it, it was the best version of Vietnam to me. I'll tell you, I had tears in my eyes, running down my cheeks. I think it was Saturday when I was after, I just found it. I just found it, Lyndon Johnson movie by accident. I want to my movie channels. Yeah. And I, you know, at the end, which by that time, a McNamara had come around and realized the folly of the ways. And Johnson was taken all along advice and all around. And then they finally came back with the end of the movie, shown the statistic. And when it came up on the screen, 58,000 Americans died for nothing. It just, you know, it just really got to me. No, it's the 80. And we're supposed to be so concerned. I mean, of course, any rational persons concerned about the 3000 people lost their lives at 9-11. And if we really had proof that Iraq was involved, you know, by now, if we had any concrete proof if we had a smoking gun, if we had even a lukewarm gun, we had nothing. And you wanted to know why we have nothing? Because there was nothing. There is absolutely nothing. Didn't know what was around. There was a line. One line they used that's right. And that is that terrorists don't leave an address. Right. Unlike traditional wars where you know who you're fighting, when you deal with terrorists, like they don't leave an address. They all rallied around for the Afghanistan thing, because we knew exactly who it was and where they were at that particular moment. I mean, we do know we're 15 of an 19 terrorist, and those attacks came from. Right. And we also know that people who are much, much more, and in fact, if you wanted to attack a country where the overwhelming majority of the population is in favor of overthrowing the government, it would be cooperating to say to least, it would be Iran not Iraq. Iran is the country. Right. Where they've trained his volon, all the other terrorist groups where they're obviously the trigger in the wood pile. So Saudi Arabia and Iran and North Korea would be far far ahead of Iraq. We've been able to contain him all these years. You know, he was a bad boy. He went into Kuwait. And we went in Iran and no time at all, we got to back out. That's all. No, no, no fuss. He represents no imminent threat to this country. But because we want a battle of cage, who knows what kind of crap this group of chicken office is going to stir up? And a public just sits back, oh yeah, he's so wonderful, and he's so good, and that's a bad, and they're gonna stole a freight train. See, that's the John Wayne crowd. They like that. They like the guy with a six shooter in the cowboy hat. And a blinking beaty little eyes. Yeah. The offer you knew and look. And of course he shouldn't worry as much like Alfred Newman says, what me worry, because he ain't going there anyway. Right. Here's the show about frontline. Thank the Lord. Hello. Neil, I'm squeezing myself. I got the info you need. Okay. The frontline episode is called War Behind Closed Door. Right. Okay. It's gonna do out. It's on the dish. They're gonna be out on the WGPH Boston Station. March 21st. Okay. If you want a fire, I could give you the 800 number. It's 29.95 plus shipping and handling. Yeah. By the time it would get here, it would be pointless, because as of today, it's available online, the whole thing. Right. Because it will be re-aired March 21st at doing at six on GPH Boston. The station up there. Yeah. The way things are going these days, we don't want to plan that far ahead. All right. No problem. I just wanted to let you know if you need to. You want me to give you the 800 number? No. I'll check it out online. All right. It's called War Behind Closed Door. All right. Thanks a lot. No problem. How can we not give him the numbers out? Oh, 560560 and Dad and Powered Town 580. Well, you should get off easy. Yeah. I always get off easy. That's what I heard. 877-785-6345 is toll-free anywhere else online night. What is it again? 877-775-6345. I never give that number because I don't even know what it is. I mean, I didn't have that number all the time. By the way, I haven't posted it. No, no. I don't know. I don't know. Because we all know. We get an occasional call on there from out of the market. I guess if we gave it more often when we get some calls on it. But most of the time we get a call from inside the market. From inside the building? Well, that's too. I would have doubt it. Probably from Maddie Bell or PD. I do like what a stranger calls. I like Charles Dernon. I don't know. Maybe I'll have one. Maybe because he's fat. Thanks, Caroline. Caroline, one of our regular facts is in the control. This is about timing. It's about her pets and Yadiyada. Thanks, Caroline. John reports a Lucy. Who's becoming the on-cronic but a good guy. I can go on. This is about your dog. Yadiyada. PBS is doing a member's choice fundraiser in March. So it's possible it could be shown then. Yes, March, 2021. John is what we just heard. The next schedule front line is not until March 20th at 10 p.m. Hmm. Well, whatever. They should do a pretty crappy job. Of course, nobody watches PBS anyway. But since they showed that here just a couple nights ago, wouldn't you think? Wouldn't you think? Uh-huh. That somebody in the mainstream news media. One of the networks. Somebody would be like a spanning on it and the exp. Yeah. Yeah. That is an amazing. The overwhelming majority of the good stories that are coming out on this are coming from Out of the US media. But it's in the UK or in Australia. Or, where have it held us coming from? Around the rest of the world. You mean, in media? Pinko, Connie's and other countries. Anti-American fellow. So crap. All his garbage about the. Or, as a matter of fact, Paul Begallama, to good point on cross for our last night. About the Washington Post. And about how everything it has to do with the the the the Bushah deal on a rack is on page eight of the Washington Post. And by every time they find out that they're full of crap, they hide in the middle of the front section. But when it come to find out about Bubba, Bubba and Monica something they had on the front page every day. So he said so much for this bookrap about the liberal Washington Post and liberal media. We all know it's a polycrap. You really ought to get that Eric Alpharman book. What liberal media? I'll just borrow yours. Or just turn on Fox News for five minutes. You'll understand what I'm talking about. No thank you. And a good news about being here is we don't get Fox News. Oh, see. Oh, right. And you wonder why I'm in such a good mood. Here's a call from what is it? Del Rey Beach. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. Hey everybody. Good. I used to listen to you. I used to live in Bunker. I know there's been drink of stuff here while I'm in listen to you. These are these the um um um electronic air waves. All right. Thank you. I actually have an office now in summary Beach. Which I am right now. And I used to listen to you back in the days when you were with Captain Dave and the bird and on the right stuff. And and before you uh you know Tommy was the uh retwin coming. And then the new coo clock's plan. So I'm here lying live in brush. I'm I'm a professional math and fact I'm an issue by issue that a person can do something liberal. But I think it's totally full of crap on this whole uh uh one was the rack because apparently you are pretty much more information than the federal government and the United States Congress and the United Nations and everything and you're just the father of the President Obama. You're a little bit of a pop show based on what? What do you face? You're being in some apparently even more than the federal government. So the United Nations passed another resolution is that what you're telling me? The United Nations already passed a resolution authorized in the first infant's fact there's a material breach of the current of the former resolution. And if they've been in the United Nations passed the second resolution which is what almost everybody is demanding including the majority of the American public if they done that. We can now just no reason to me because the president was already passed. That's like uh you know uh well. I like the United Nations. Since you're so hysterical about this. Since you're so hysterical also we're going to throw you around the tays, the liberal talk ho, all this other crap. You're you're going to talk about crap. What evidence? Where's the smoking gun? What is it that a rack represents a threat to you? Well first of all we have to be real you and I are both fortunate enough to live in what's called the Constitution of democracy. And so I'm not interested in some kind of a civics lesson. I asked you a question okay don't give me double talk. What evidence is there that a rack represents an imminent threat to you or to me? Well um I don't thank you have a nice day. 1058 at 560 QAN. You're my normal. You're supposed to support radio by 680. You weigh in. I could can't keep a packer in his pants. What is the world? What is the world? Tonight on Cops it's the deldoodle. I need a new computer. What's the hard drive? What's the monitor? What's the mouse? What do you know anything? How much of that stuff do you smoke? Is that a joint man? I'm looking for a hot. Oh yeah. Tonight on Cops. You're really stupid things when you're happy. I'm going to join in this man. I hate cops looking. Hey dude you're getting busted. What's the number two? What's the number two? What's the number two? Yeah you and your liberal talk show. Yeah that guy. He was classic man. You don't pay him with that broad brush. He was a textbook example of what's wrong with talk show callers. And then of course when you ask him, well get down don't kill me. I double talk in a specific lesson about where it is where that just answer the question. It couldn't do it. It wasn't going to do it. We were up against the break anyway but one extra minute because I could tell he wasn't going to do it. Well you didn't have an answer from you knew that. And the idea that the idea that we all have to go step in line and invent them to use that word again, the venom that he was attacking with. Yeah you and your liberal. Yeah I don't give a crap if he listened on Zator or not that's another lifetime ago. What does that have to do with anything? There was once upon a time he liked me right and now because of the fact he doesn't agree with what I'm saying I know more than the UN. If the UN had the proof, if the UN really bought the colon pala and by the way how come if the UN was buying it? When the French ambassador to the UN was finished speaking he got an ovation in the UN which is almost on a herd of that kind of display of emotion. It never happens in the UN and my colon pal finished with his statement which he cut short because he was pissed off and fired up. There was deadly silence. How come sir if the UN is so convinced now all arrest of the world? Oh those are all American hate and counties. Nick Christoff writes in the liberal New York Times. See I'm not one of those people who buys into this crap that liberal is a dirty word. I'm proud to be a liberal okay? Hitler on the Nile. Nicholas D. Christoff writes in the newspaper on our website. Now I wasn't going to read because I have no voice to read anyway and plus it's bedtime stories but who gives a crap because that guy just pisses me off because he doesn't know what that he's talking about. He says there's so much chest dumping so many alarms about Iraqi menace. That I sometimes feel that the only patriotic thing to do is invade Iraq and plow salt into its soil. So it's useful to conjure a conservative war hero like Dwight Eisenhower and consider what he would do if he were present today. After his experience with Hitler, I Quitstan after the Lily Libert pussyfooting piece nicks and squished Saddam Hussein like a bug right? No probably not. Eisenhower led the European allies to victory in WWE 2 was present from 1953 to 1961. Face the crisis in Egypt similar to today's and effectively chose containment rather than invasion. Likewise, even when faced with a threat of weapons of mass destruction, President John Epc Kennedy chose to contain QOE than invaded and President Ronald Reagan chose to contain Libby rather than invaded. I hope we have the courage and discipline to emulate such restraint by Eisenhower Kennedy and Reagan today and use containment over war for Iraq. In Iks case he faced demand perceived in the West as a far greater minister than Saddam is today, Gamal Edgel Lasser of Egypt. Nasser had the potential to upset the globe in a way that Saddam doesn't, Nasser was idolized by the Arab masses and aggressively intervened abroad. He helped the Algerians fight the French, forge close ties with Russia and infiltrated terrorists into Israel. Israel also went terrorist operations in Egypt, blowing up American libraries and cultural targets and attempt to turn its NASA. When Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956, the West was sure that the Canal would fall apart and disrupt global trade, Parrero radio once boasted millions of Arabs are preparing to blow up all of America's interests, all of America's installations and your entire existence America. All the hospital protest, Nasser didn't have weapons of mass destruction, actually he did, Nasser's troops used mustard gas and Yemen. European leaders were determined not to appease this Hitler on the Nile, France Israel and Britain conspired to invade Egypt and Ossnasser. It was too risky to allow this adventurer this miniature Hitler to develop, for Mr. Prime Minister Gai Gimalea, a fan later told Nasser's biographer, Jean Lachatur. Heck was outraged and so did the Europeans, what they tried to do to us now. He fought the invaders to retreat and solve the crisis peacefully. The US is committed to a peaceful solution they declared. Thank God for Ike. If the Hoxibon running the show then, we might still have troops in Egypt. The Hoxibon they are credited have a good recent record their military forecast. They correctly saw that the first Gulf War in the Afghanistan invasion would go easily, while those worried about crackmires. But the Nasser history also reminds us that the Hoxibon had a consistent track record of shrieking obsessively in seeing one minor country after another as global threats in an eye-bolting alarmist way that in retrospect looks hysterical. In 1950s and 60s the Hoxibon magnified the threat from Vietnam and Cuba. In 1980s they have said about Nicaragua only a one week bus ride from Texas. None of these threats were imagined but they were exaggerated. Now the focus is on Sodom and it's true that he's been brutal and threatening for 25 years. Especially in the 1980s when Don Rumsfeld was co-using up to him in Baghdad at the US was shipping him 7 strains of anthrax. The last 10 years have been the best behaved of Sodom's career not saying much, and he's now 65 controlling an army only a third of its peak strength and in the twilight of his menace. The arguments against containment of Sodom were also made about Nasser. It will not work Western credibility will vanish if we back off. If we don't invade now we'll have to fight him in a few years when he's stronger and yet Nasser faded away as Sodom is already fading. So one can accept that Sodom is a threat and that Iraq would be far better off without him and yet prefer the Eisenhower approach of containment. We might remember that Eisenhower warned Britain in 1956 that its insistence on outing the ousting Nasser was leading to sweeping anti-British sentiment and that while initial military successes might be easy the eventual price might become far too heavy. Right, Nick Christophe in New York times today. By the way, speaking of Eisenhower, the last thing he did when he left office in the inaugurated Kennedy. In one of his last speeches he warned he said, beware the military industrial establishment. Hmm, to say former hero general, right, WWW always like being aware of the military industrial establishment. The dangerous one, this is what he said. It's been a Kennedy, of course, they were some of the people who assassinated him, but that's be-side of him. Oh. 560, 560, 560, 560, only 18T lines were to do the show today. Can you say have no doubt I said no to- How's the pull coming? I'd rather croak. I'd rather croak than talk to any morassals like that, cos I don't know. I don't mind disagree, but I'll say I listen, I was trying to be patient, right? But it's always it starts with it. Yeah, you liberal about y'all, I'd rather crap. Oh, you say crap like I said, the same-huh? He saved the good insults for when he called me back. Oh, did he? To say one. What? Oh, cos you know that-that you're scared of him. You know how to balls with the bait, don't you know? He didn't-he wouldn't answer the question, plus we're already a minute past the break. And when it's obvious he had nothing to say. I'm going to sit here and just hand the show over to him. What an asshole sir. Go back to where the hell are you saying go back to the line? Go back to South Carolina with the bans who on your knee. You're finna perfect. There's a reason there's a border. I'd rather croaked here and 50 votes than vote for George W. 169. Vote for Hillary 79. I'd rather croaked in via Michael Jackson CD43. I'd rather croaked and listen to how he'd David had 40. He's moving up a little bit. Then watch another my Tyson 517. Rather croaked and rave a mustang. Ten of us would make that this is entased. You didn't listen to that? Have you heard the mustang? Yes, I did. I've a little over that. Are you trying to tell me what I voted for now? No, I just thought you were going to. I saw a gaslight. Pretty good movie. I guess what I saw yesterday. I give up. It's entirety because you touted and you said it was a good movie. Yeah. Because it was on again. I'm the IFC channel in the National Film Channel. Friendsie. Oh, yeah. It was okay. It was a long, pretty long. Pretty long to go all the way through that for that ending. I mean, fairly predictable. What the potato truck? The potato truck was cute. Yeah. When a cop saw her legs and body dangly out of the back of the potato truck, that was kind of cute. Yeah. I think when I don't like this story about innocent Sentinel, which one? Mother's of Lionel Tate and the Thang of Resonado. Oh, yeah. Oh, no. You know what? Crack is that. First of all, you Catholic's out there. I'm talking only about the ones who support this kind of mentality. You better understand that the rest of the world doesn't give a flying crap about this pop or any other pop, they'll pay the other old man in the press. And even though I may have it agree with him about the war, and you know, you can pick and choose one from Colombe and one from Colombe, who gives a crap what he says. Right. And they're meeting with in the Vatican this way to campaign for changes in how the US handles children who commit serious grump. Remember when it came to the US last time it was in the country, right? Any, he said, don't execute that guy in St. Louis, where it had a was. Yeah, they put on the execution. Right. Yeah. Of course, St. Louis, of course, being a very heavy Catholic city. Mm-hmm. This is the, this is the Hutspa of organized religion. Not just the Catholic Church, all of them. Yeah. Go practice your superstition and walk around, oh, you know, what other movies I saw the other day? But that Sunday, I taped them. The Omen, part one, was the other one. Damien, what a day. Yeah, Omen too. They also had another term with a lot of those. The first one with Gregory Peck, right? With Anne Lee, uh, Remick. Mm-hmm. Right? Right. And a second moment with William Holden and Lee Grant. Damien, look at me. It's all for you. Freaking, Damien. Punk. Shmuck. Yeah. But anyway, two South Florida moms, Lionel Tate Nathaniel Brazil, are in a delegation of 34 people from Round US who are meeting with Vatican officials this week. Their sons, as we know, were both convicted of adults from murders they committed ages 12 and 13. Tate now 16 is certainly two years of a life sentence without possibility of parole for the 1998 beating death of Tiffany Unic, a six year old family friend. And Brazil also 16 is served two years and I'm months of a 28 year of sentence for shooting death of teacher very Bruno at Lakewood School in 2000. I see I don't understand why Lionel Tate got a sticker sentence, life without possibility of parole. And the other kid, I mean, you know, he's smothered her and he was like, it was indefensible but nevertheless, how do you compare that to a kid that takes a gun to school? Because the teacher won't let him in to talk to his girlfriend. What's his brains out right there? How do you compare that? I don't know with a chart. The visit comes as Tate's attorney is expected to launch a second effort to get clemency and as Tate and Brazil's appeals make their way through the system.

He got about the parents that were standing outside of the hospital. Yeah. The kid, you know, he survived the fire, but he was burned badly. Right. He's in hospital and the mother's just crying hysterically and the reporter's sticking to Michael. And you're facing the patient. We don't need one here. One. Just sick. Really sick. And I'm going to say it again. I'm going to include it, especially for that Jack asked to call me a few minutes ago. Oh, we're fortunate enough to live in it.

We have was into that before yeah Ethnic cleansing being thousands and thousands of people being murdered Right going into that which was was that really a war on the level of what's going on today? No, not way on NATO and the United Nations and everybody that we were just a part of At any rate don't confuse or here's what it says my condolences about your little dog tiny My take on is the rack thing. It's what it's more the same going to a rack look like the hero just in time for Reaction my fear is people are real like bush with all the patriotic crap and it reminds of forget how everything is tank and says you sure time after Baba has left Another thing I remember during the end of Clinton term gas went up and the Republicans were going nuts blaming Clinton Other gases $2 a gallon some places where the same Republicans screaming about gas prices Well, let me say it again to you sir both parties suck They both suck It wouldn't be an semester winter today if it worked for the fact that the Democratic Party was so weak They're a buffer to be sure, but they suck Anyway, here's an article common dreams.org rate the website Liberal 12 reasons to oppose a war with Iraq by Russell Moe Moe Khaber and Robert Weissman You ready I'm ready 12 reasons to want the drum. I forget sir all those liberals like Pat few cannon Robert Novac Maybe as a people around the world last weekend demonstrate against war on Iraq there was no mistaking the message no war But especially with the airwaves and op-ed pages dominated by warmongers who mock and this characterized the burgeoning piece movement There remains a need to continually reiterate the common sense reasons to oppose a war here are a dozen One Iraq is no threat to the US What what one of the weakest militaries in the region Iraq is surely no threat to the world's lone superpower? There was no evidence it has risk close-taving nuclear capacity There's no evidence that it has the means to launch a chemical and biological attack against the US if in fact it has such weaponry There's no evidence of any Iraqi connection to al Qaeda Two Iraq is deturable even if it had the means to threaten the US Iraq would be deterred by the certain even overwhelming military response in avene any attack on the US that Iraq is Deturable as shown by its decision not to use chemical or biological weapons against the US or Israel during the Gulf war three Iraq's only conceivable threat to the US is an event of war Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW against the US RoxyA directed George Tenet in October 2002 led a decongress Should Sodom conclude that a US led attack could no longer be deterred he probably would become much less constrained in adopting terrorist actions Which ties in the other story we had before yes For other terrorist risk rise in avene war a US attack in subsequent occupation of a lack of variety of inspiration And new recruitment fodder for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups and will stimulate a long term increased RISC terrorism either on US soil or against US citizens overseas Five US soldiers are vulnerable to chemical or biological attack in a war Although there's little reason to doubt the US military will try a relatively quickly in the event of a war US soldiers faced non-negligible risk of casualty House-tows fighting in Baghdad would be perilous If push administration accusations that Sodom maintains a CBW capabilities true and if its friends have Inteld in showing that Iraq plans to use CBW in a vente war both are both non-fabricated and accurate the US soldiers are what made your risk Last Sunday 60 minutes reported the army investigation show between 60 and 90 percent of its chemical and biological OI weapon protective gear malfunction did 60 to 90 percent I saw it a Pentagon spokesperson actually suggested that holes in gas mask could easily be covered by duct tape It was nothing we do out and by duct tape share with our military doesn't dick-chainy all-inside Six Inspections can work us we never heard again from that boxer from Friday Idiot Six inspections can work To whatever extent Iraq maintains weapons of mass destruction it's clear that the previous inspections process succeeded in destroying the overwhelming proportion Iraqi intelligence now with static inspectors and I'm making progress despite the history on a city administration Past experience suggests the inspection process can work in finished the job Seven common sense is error on the side of non-violence Since Iraq poses no imminent threat to the US to many of its neighbors it makes sense to continue given Speckons a chance work and always be resorted to later but once the war is commenced the opportunity to achieve legitimate objectives without violence are lost And additionally obvious cost use of violence tends to be get more violence sparing a highly unpredictable cycle 8 the doctrine of preventative wars a threat to international law and humanity Conceating there's no human threat to the US administration is sought to justify war under a doctrine of preemptive or preventative action But if a legitimate to start war because of what another country might do sometime in the future Then there'd be very little legal or moral constraint on warmaking a proposition is dangerous anti-Moral Might be that law they passed an atonement Delaware remember? Yeah, whether arresting people on suspicion of the or going to commit a crime's atonement of future because you look like it Right If that were the case Carlos there he'd Oh and ten to twenty right now looks suspicious Nine reject empire many of the leading proponents of war motivated by desire to demonstrate US military might and commence an era when US military powers exercise more routinely To satisfy the whims of elite US factions Many proponents now overtly defend US Idea the idea of US imperialism just to find on the grounds that the United States apparently unique among all previous aspirants to Imperial authority is Motivated by provotion of democracy and human rights But all empires have profits such self-serving rationalizations to legitimize narrow self-interest The present case is no different imperialism is fundamentally in from incompatible with democracy Ten revend his not a legitimate motive for war There seems little doubt that part of the Bush administration motivation for war is a desire to get Sodom since he refused to go away after the Gulf War and allegedly targeted the president's father Sodom is an awful and brutal dictator and an assassination attempt if there was one as a heinous act Or revenge should not be the basis for war 11 there are better solutions to our energy problems It overstates the case to say a war with a rack would be a war for oil There are too many other contributing factors for the rush to war at the same time It is it is not credible to claim designs at a wacky oil are not part of the calculus And it's hard to see the United States carry much about a rack at the company to not sit in the world second largest oil reserves But it's past time for the US and the rest of the world to move beyond oil and carbon based sources of energy Existing efficiency technologies and renewable energy sources if deployed could dramatically reduce reliance on conventional energy sources And modest investments and renewables could soon move us away from an oil-based economy A 12. Thank you at the same last one A racky lives are at stake Unless a war brings immediate abdication by Sodom military action is assured across massive casualties among Iraqi conscripts and especially Huh, I'm on your rakey civilians. Solidarity with the Iraqi people not their brutal government but the people request opposition We're almost certain to cause them anymore as an enormous suffering. That's it and thank God I I And orange means a time when you say what is my color blind on the ass When the sweat Oh here's a little history lesson to see this from very when you have a idea But it's the person the greatest risk we face is not from Sodom who say to Iraq or from King John Eolid North Korea By the way, it's Kim Jong-il He be ill and Because I am I got a little cold, but I that last thing I read man Just how could you let me read so I don't know what stop doing that. What do you idea? From terrorism per se from beginning at time the world has always been a violent place with wars and terrorism as a chronic condition of humanity The reason why America faces terrorism for the first time in our history comes from it is for the first time in our history What about Timic Bay? I'm sorry Comes from the fact that our government has been influenced by a foreign power intent on importing us and foreign conflicts Who is this foreign power everyone knows the identity of this foreign power, but none dare say it? However your former esteemed and courageous colleague the honorable senator William Fulbright identified the danger of the TV program meet depress in the facts Think that they pack it about Israel pretty It doesn't say I say I thought it was Serbia As far as I'm concerned you know my feeling about Israel and the Palestinians You know screw them all that's in my feeling the idea that the rest of the human race has to be held in limbo that all of our lives have to be endangered because of this Centuries old this thousands and thousands of years old the history between the Arabs and the Jews not acceptable You know They want to kill each other have a good time. Don't drag us in and if the Arabs didn't have all this oil, you know something that would be the philosophy of just about everybody And all you Zionist out there if you don't like the answer too bad because I'm nauseated with a Irelia Sharon and he's got them illegal settlements when hell doesn't end already What are they stop giving the Palestinian suicide bombers and excuse to uh to do it? What the out of the one court he's more than Jacques Cretjent at least he consistently talks out of the same corner of his mouth in frog, you know Where's your motocs out of both corners out of one court he's talking peace and not the other hand to keep expanding the settlements But nevertheless what what's the use there is self-fulfilling property that's never ever gonna end Did I say that years ago? Yeah, I've never gonna end because you're dealing with religious fanatics I mean you know is really Arab peace is an awesome or I it's an I just ain't gonna happen And this is what nobody wants to talk about once in a great while somebody will bring it up But nobody in the mainstream media dares talk about religious extremism fundamentalist lunacy That's what the problem is in a world right there Why do you think Turkey's so psychotic about the Kurds? They're afraid they might be eating their Kurds in way in on their territory They're afraid of that. They don't want to separate Kurdish country there, right? It's the messed up all their plans because they're not cases to the Kurds exactly and then you got the Shiites and you got the You know they're all full of Shiites for as I'm concerned Just a bunch of religious crazy people like I said before and to see so many people die because arguments over headdier, you know It's really pathetic the big cloth or the little cloth I mean what which being issue we have Should we have the Jewish beanie do we have to have the one to pop in the cardinals where? We have to have the biniana to save the was cardinals like a baseball cap which a bini we supposed to put on So we can respect whichever crazy guy you want to respect this I'm kind of like the fur hockey puck my I wish we had a place I guess we do it's called Holland to better such a bunch of primitive bastards over there, you know No seriously it's a wonderful enlightened country as far as the government but the fact is that For whatever reason the people there to go back and answer again while I'm a fed up with Amsterdam with Holland They've chosen to continue living in the Stone Age and it's just not a comfortable place to live It's very refreshing when you escape the the repression of the United States to go there and see what real living and breathing people think and How they live and the freedom that exists and the not judgmental approach to life. That's marvelous But the idea that you know like running water is almost a revolutionary concept. I mean that may be a little extreme But there's no need for that, but they like it and you can't go to another country and say well gee It's really great. I love all the freedoms and all the open mindedness in the bohemian atmosphere But can't you just live this way and I'm gonna sit and get out of here asshole How do you know how do you say that in Dutch and do I yeah? How do you say buffongula and Do I see that's one problem with the Dutch? I left one letter out for their not full in me, you know the old Dutch So I'm concerned about your voice so Cindy says sorry here about time. Thank you, Cindy and also we're in thank you It took it late and I put high to sleep yesterday was 14 years in a couple months old With the end his liver will gave out and that was the end of it I beg you pardon. I said I'm gonna you're doing a show my voice a lot Reading and then the top it off and he's got me doing live spots here to speak in Carlos How does he get no longer eradicating like poises a trouble maker Slaved driver. I dreamt you're run out of voice on that last day. Believe me. I just I just sweetened The literary in there In fact I'd rather croaked than read another bedtime story. I should have put that on the pool for me today So I'd have a choice. I think you should bail up to the segment What I think you should bail out I don't know what you're talking about I don't know what you're feeling anywhere. I'm scared that if you blow your ass out and you take the calls and I'll say to you I gotta do that spot anyway. I know I don't feel bad I just I just have a throat or I just don't want you to strain something there to strain it because then you'll be out all day tomorrow And that would be bad That's something about who don't do it. Well the problem is that we're not of what you call it? What do you call it? Oh recall it recall I only had I only had one thing left one pack in it. Those were magical and I sucked them all down and they'd go their gone I too many of those are good for anyway, although I noticed that they don't really have much effect on my blood sugar I just mentioned that for your diet better That's not that for your people that are sick and tear to take and that stuff that's got certain not everybody is allergic to Serbatole if you ever eat a bulb I'll know if you have that That thing Then you probably I think I've built up an immunity over the years with these cough trumps. Not me I eat about three or four of those halls mental with the sugar free and I'm like Squirtin all over the place anyway go ahead and take some calls and I'll sit here and dummy up and I was bad Miami likes a love yeah, hi Neo. He's there. Oh How you doing me up? Sorry about your dog. Thank you. Listen, Neil. I know your show isn't a team and I know that When it's all about but I just wanted to say I'm so glad that you're finally taking on the mad man in the White House We'll be finally well this guy is crazy. He's been saying that since day one since he before even got in there We mean that's right. So it's been a promise right this guy It's probably not talking about they're actually talking about tactical nuclear weapons right right that's right This is insanity. Yeah, and it and if you just figure that out If you listen to the state of the union address, uh-huh. It's not just Iraq. No, no from that man A festo. We're gonna go after everybody that all the evil-doers man 1 by 1 We're gonna wipe them out and take whatever assets that while whatever else they got and the most dangerous thing is that these super nationalists It's just a matter of time before they start arresting people who disagree with them What's better to be in a super naturalist? Well, I'll tell you right now. They sure work heavy do you try to get this your off the or a couple months back? They're very very dangerous and then people are sitting back and they're just watching this alcoholic Go bananas and they're just shouting USA USA you know somebody has to take the time They don't forget he's only the face man. He's just he's just the PR guy for Cheney and Wolfowitz and All the Richard Pearl and Libby and all these other people. They're the ones called all the shots They don't hide the chicken ox the one that I think is really calling the shots is his father He's he has a lot more power than people are seeing he's moved you know daddy didn't act this way when he was an office. Yeah, that's true Is daddy he's a daddy where daddy kept his honor. He resisted But at least his daddy lined up the world to tobacco this guy is actually yeah But he keep in mind he lined up the world because because number one Sodom had just invaded Kuwait and number two right rest of the Arab world was competing their pants They were crap in all over their their night counts because they were afraid that they were gonna be next including the Saudis number one Right, but this guy he's the French I know you're not big on the French But the French are our friends the French are the ones that helped this country become free now But you don't understand sir the only people are friends are people are agree with us I mean that but that kind of mentality you know It's it's a nightmare and the fact that people are so stupid so many millions stupid not to see how ugly that argument is and how painting the other A political party is being unpaid throughout it because they don't go step along is a very scary thing I thought that we elected or somebody stole or whatever we have a president of all the people not just of whoever agrees with him Right, but that's not the way he's looking at it if you're if you don't agree with him 100% This guy is gonna take reprival today. They said they they told the French that unless they Vote with us. They're actually they're gonna be considered very unfriendly What are that right if I if they're going to agree with us McDonald's is also gonna start selling those freedom fries And we're working too. What's what? Well, you know the world needs more people you know like you especially in this country who can You know really give the views of most of the people in the United States The people in the United States don't want to go to war with anybody There were two to handle this situation. I got this for us are the people up here sure is not a one-in-e-part of it overwhelming And if you go to the rest of the world a Germany France Italy space yeah, no mind no yeah It's interesting that Spain you know we've got that pimple over here now is good buddy Anzard But 85% of people in Spain the one-in-e-part of this war and also the same in Italy and of course his buddy and Italy Burma Scones the biggest crook on the face of the Europe makes it look like a a piker Yeah, but this is madness and I'm just so glad that you're taking the time to point out the people the craziness that were under and You know, this is the year 2003 we don't want to make the same mistakes that that were made in 1903 and the in the first world well, would you start this century with death all over again for crying out loud Yeah, well, we sure don't want to make the same mistake we made in Vietnam We don't need another 58,000 young Americans coming home and body bags have a great day pal.

George? Yes. Is it a radio's off? Okay, why don't you know where that echo is coming from? That was somebody talking to me. All right. Who's answering the phone? No. No. Whoever's answering the phone, man, like two times, they'll hang up on you. No, no, no, I'm not. You guys are paying me. No, no, no, we're not. This is matter fact. No, no, no, no, no, no. He's paying us. That's probably why they're doing such a good job. All right. But, uh, but, uh, hey, by the way, George, the last time, I mean, one was the last time we went to war with somebody for all of you. Honestly, we aren't going to... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. What was the last time? Yeah, we were going to let the first time. And the Gulf War, and they were saying the same thing, no, going to war, no, but far. We didn't go on there taking anybody's oil. Mm-hmm. Right, wrong. We didn't take anybody's oil. We were going there and, uh, we were going to the rescue of some people who were going there. You know, they were protecting the other world countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia do you know, they might have been part of it. We were doing business with. Yeah. Yeah, but this is the same thing here. I mean, if you don't think we're going to war, because this guy has a chance of giving biological and chemical agents to terrorists, which he does. He does have that capability of doing it. Yeah, I mean, I'm just... Who does it? Who does it? Who does it? I could give Draino to a rank head. What? I said, have a great time. Yeah, really sad, really stupid and sad. And you know what? Like an old woman's show. It's like the pig lie like the Nazis said. If you keep saying it loud enough and light them up. Oh, chemicals. First of all, in the beginning, it had nothing to do with biological or chemical weapons. Right. In the beginning, it was regime change. And he's a brutal murderous dictator. He gasped his own people and enacted and worked too well. So now it's weapons of mass destruction and chemical and biological weapons. We can be out of yati. What he could get. What's everybody in there, brother, by the way. In fact, who's still... Who is still producing and violation of all the international treaties, by the way? Who's still producing chemical and biological weapons? Is there a little USA? Well, he's just doing about this. One thing about this administration, one of the first things they did when I came to office, all those treaties that we ever signed, yet, forget about it. You know, nothing. They don't have a new deal. Not if the R's new deal. We got our own new deal. We got the raw deal. We're more than righteous. We don't have to live by those deals. Right? You just wait till a USA Patriot Act part two gets into the... Then you won't be opening up a big mouth, Mr. I'll say that right now. You either... Oh, wait, you're gonna say handed him.

Guys, that's not nice at all, no. I'm not really gonna cry. I'm gonna call your parents as what I'm gonna do. Let's face it. Being a house husband is hard enough. Without having to worry about the laundry. And thanks to new simply clean wood bleach, I don't have to worry. Simply clean gets out all the tough things like... ...grastings, coffee, piss, the piss... ...this chart, piss, piss... ...dry it on, piss, like on this t-shirt. So, when my wife gets home, my laundry will score an A-plus. I'm in a home. Well, there he is now. New simply clean wood bleach. Get up the f*** dirt. So anyway, speaking of that, USA Today reports natural gas and heating oil prices surge. No. Natural gas and heating oil futures extended their blistering rally into a second day today hitting record highs on forecast of bitter cold lasting in the March and rapidly declining supplies. The development's point to likely increases and already bloated home heating bills. Residential heating oil prices are about 50% from a year ago when the average winter heating oil bill was 642 to bus energy department says bills might approach a grand this winter. Well, natural gas prices are not as easy to track consumers were reporting similar jumps before this week's rise. Higher natural gas and heating oil prices will cut more to consumer budgets. Say, gym Williams of WTRG economics and energy consultant. If you're old enough to remember it's time to bring out that sweater that Jimmy Carter used to wear while encouraging us to turn our thermostats down. I remember that. When we were being held hostage, we not only had the hostages in a ran. But the entire country is being held hostage for OIL. I remember people freezing. The increased heating cost which in proper fact higher demand during an especially cold winter in many parts of the USA drag act as a drag on the economy. First mention that. We had started in the right. Remember all those old people that were freezing to death because they were afraid they were going to be able to pay what? That's right. I sure do. Just end there be more than this year. Right. It's compassionate of conservatives a man. Just like we had with Jimmy Carter, compassionate of companions stupidity. I say 560670560 and date and rowered pound 563 of rise and wireless. Here's West Palm, hello. Yeah. How are you doing? Great. You got to go back to I think we're the soft thirties. And I thought about it and I said, today we allowed George Bush to get in there and the way he was selected. Yeah. And then he was selected by his the Supreme Court buddies. That's right. The way he's right. When that afternoon was over, I said it's over and Americans just sat still. No big deal. Two weeks after he got in, people seemed to get all prices were about $1. And two weeks after he went in, they went to $1.35. No one said anything. Right. You know? And then I said, was Clinton, was the whole weapon's mass destruction thing. Clinton took our 95% of his stuff to look through his passions. No one dies. Right. You know? And then I said, if we take, if we look at everything, who has weapons of mass destruction? We do. We have smart blocks. We have the answer, and our labs. You know? And like I said, you know, the way people were about Michael Jackson and all this crap. Right.

Yeah, I mean any Roger else is you know Conservative people that are on your shows, I mean it just mouthpieces ahead of them. I journalist and that's right You know, I know if you told him that's why that's why I would program that thing right off your set I would program it out as I was watching this morning. He had the Geneva Rufflow and had one of the The Fox and friends and it was just violent I mean he he can't get one in word in I mean if you're not right wing or conservative on those Morning shows he doesn't have you on there and that's obvious You know from the program that he has Mm-hmm. That's all I'd all spin all day don't forget all day Have a great day. How about that? I kind of like kind of like one of those the washing machines that won't go out I'll spin all day just keeps going around and around But this one only tells to the right so I heard we were going to use tactless nuclear weaponry Did you hear what rum spell said before no I think the most Pointy thing was when he said yeah, what was that? What was why? Thought I said they would probably leave Sodom thing. You know, we couldn't have that Sodom had the interview with Dan rather even though this is certainly not news I was afraid the drop had been corrupted. No. Oh, we wouldn't do that That's a special only America's been corrupted now until one on five sixty w q a m n and Or figuring it out. I'm gonna get an exit. Oh, you want this How are David's a bitch?

You I had to get done. I had to get done. Oi! 1257 at 560WQ and thanks to George for doing most of the show today. Oh, it was nothing. It was like, I wasn't even doing it. Literally. Small groups often skirt pyro-technic rules. We do have this on a website, only. But it did be not. I just didn't put on it. Let's take it on bands, because it's really, it's almost comical if there weren't so many people died in God injury, right? But to watch the scoring about, between the club owner and the rock band, the Great White, and everybody else involved. Oh no, we, uh, I know not. We didn't know about it. In Rhode Island, this is Massachusetts, power techniques such as those that constantly blaze at the station must be set up by a technician licensed by the state that person or company usually handles the paperwork as well. Filing for a permit with a local fire department that instrain the far worse for inspectors and modify the displays local authorities require. The process, however, is easily avoided by bands that simply don't hire licensed technicians and have their own stage hands set up the power techniques. In some cases, club owners are willing to look the other way, while this is occurring those in the industry say they're willing to look the other way. If a band doesn't come forward, they believe they do a behind our back, nobody tells us we have no way of knowing, so Captain William Metavelody, far-for-rights in division of the Worst or Fire Department, they move on to the next town the next night. Rave Tyler, guitar player for the now-to-funk 11 cries at the band routinely, used power techniques including at the station but never hired a licensed technician. A stage hands set up the power techniques each time he said, to his knowledge no permit was ever applied for either. Now look into the bed for the owners, you know what? And that's how we figured it. We'll look the other way. Yeah. And then of course, we've got all these people, OG, how can you have a stage without power techniques? Uh, excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me, think inside a wooden frame building with no sprinkler system and the foam rubber and saline. Right. Exactly. That's soaked in carousine. I'll tell you what, maybe we can have the band come and do the show and you're living or what would be good. And set off a little power techniques display and see how that works first before we try to get into a wood frame building with no sprinkler system and foam my insulation. Alright, just, yeah. What's the use you feel weak? You want to just get on a floor and make guttable sounds. Like that. Like the shot world. And so as we saw, I can understand my most people about, you know, they want to escape. And I released from all these horrible things. There you go. So, excuse me, for bringing up the fact that we brought 58,000 Americans did from Vietnam. Oh, absolutely nothing. And those people who are opposed to it, those people who open up a mouth, those people had the balls to protest. Those people who defected and came up here to Canada when any other guy did in place. Communist. Same kind of crap. Communist sympathizers, cowards, pinkos, all the other. All of these things. And then we're going through the same thing again. Because there are a few people enough intelligence to see two all of this bullcraft and see that this was orchestrated long before 9-11 ever. If we were going after the people that were involved with 9-11 planning it and involved them in any way, shape or form, I'd be right there. Hallelujah. I'd be out there waving the American flag of the streets up here. We already did that. Let's go get him. Let's go. Didn't we do that already? Yeah. So, do you have a DVD player up there? No, I do not. I can go by one. For just 80 million electronics, there is all over our young street. Just curious, because I was going to buy and send you the born on the 4th of July DVD. Since the topical right now. And since I've already got the Howdy Duties here at DVD from Boca Brian, you do? Yeah, he sent me that as a birthday gift. So, howdy Duties want. Well, howdy you do the like that. I do the pretty good. Maybe tomorrow I'll be duty and even better. Bye bye. Bye bye. I'm the weather show. I'm 5602A. I'm 4MR. I've got a little poke in the ass about 8 o'clock this morning.
