We finally got somebody to champion the cause got you marlin people You make me nauseous Oh you're so negative I'm not negative I'm just being honest with you Nobody cares you try to force feed hollow bottle or horse it doesn't want it Okay, it don't like it It doesn't give a crap about it and they're telling us that movies are boring Oh, if I got a movie for them I don't want to get into it though I'll just I'll turn to my coffin I'm talking about okay the movie I want you to see the most is What I should I got it Oh, here's a fact that says this is a must see movie eating raw wool It's an ancient movie it wasn't bad the net a spick movie There's a spick in it hilarious black comedy slash cult classic about a nerdy couple the bland living in LA trying to cope with their swing or neighbors When Paul accidentally kills one of the sleaze bags the couple realized they'd be doing suicide in themselves a favor by Offing the creeps robbing them and investing in their dream rest ride a total of who the hot tub scene is priceless definitely worth a watch eating raw wool Says this Paxor I'm surprised you haven't seen it it's old It's ancient Well yesterday afternoon let me just start well before we even get to that Let's not put the cart before the horse you got the cart Okay, we asked yesterday Neil show and fact I want to take a quicky pull can we do that or we'll erick it all better shape Yeah, but not that I really yeah both both you're right the quicky pull is fun to get him but not a shape Oh, I'm serious which of these three would you rather hear us talk about and you know you don't kill one of those choices Well, I'd rather die than hear about any of them know which of these three things would you rather hear about on the radio Movies Marlins or golf Ha Right You thought was your only choice Which let's get that on there right? I guess I better do yesterday's the result Neil shows on movies are and we took a pounding on this man 1200 votes even nice total Ponderous effing pod rest 323 31.9% say the shows on the movies have been ponderous good 2019 okay 210 made a little bit of a comeback getting boring 198 16 and a half percent and great a breath of fresh air 190 last place 15.8% So the negative the two negative categories 31.9 and this fifty eight point four percent I mean the 48.4 percent Got it Which means that over half over 50% which is more than George's W got even if you count the votes is being real in the election But so anyway, let's do the cookie pool which of these three would you rather hear us talk about movies Marlins or golf Huh Well, no seriously stop and think what's on our radio station to rest of the day the other other than three hours Joe and Mark around by the way Hey, if I'm always less than Joe wants his five to six hour back I'm in a little watching Magnolia, which is a three hour eight minute movie last night a shocking movie A astonishing but I'll get into that and the phone reasons are good friend Joe Costello Papa, Papa, I always enjoy talking to Joey's a good guy, but papa, you know He wants to five to six hour back. He'd like to be on when somebody might be listening. Okay when somebody's awake He's got a little voodoo doll of Mo as what I'm hearing. I didn't know he didn't tell me that But I just surmised as much as put the mojo one of he's taken away his mojo In fact wait till he sees the picture of Mo on all fours with a lampshade on his head I'm waiting myself to be able to see the real clear pristine when it shows up this afternoon in my mail. I can't wait to see that It's a must see Now, is there gonna do this or not? Because he might be listening He's on a phone with him right now. Come we want it on there right now. The other stuff get it off of it before we get anymore negative votes anymore hostile negative votes Which of these three would you rather hear about Marlon's movies or golf? So yesterday afternoon I popped in a movie that George recommended and other than bully George is on our hot streak with movies Requiem for dream was sensational Blengherry then gregland Ross was spectacular and shall I what born of the fourth of July? That was good It was depressing yeah Shallow grave a little and it starts out across it's a bunch of brits. Although I did like Alex a little bit But it's a bunch of brits and it starts out real silly. You think it's gonna be a silly movie because it's brits and brits are silly We should give Carlos credit for that because I saw it in lightah, but he was the one that actually thought to bring it up. I see But as we have he also brought up kids in gummo George perfect kids in gummo Oh Gummi kids I'm gonna do it before the show is over. I'm gonna take both of those DVDs and show them out the window So watch shallow grave yesterday afternoon and as I said it starts out silly and as it goes on It starts picking up steam and by the end of it Yeah, it's pretty amazing. Yeah the last 20 minutes is over. I'm astonishing I don't want to give it away, but put that bitch cut what she deserved you know it. I loved it She got what she deserved she had to come and I'm just a little bit curious though when it movie ends You think Alex survived all of that? Yeah Really do because you saw what was under the floor board. I don't want to give it up Yep Here's the facts that says why not try a couple of Canadian made films. Hey, oh you can if you watch your film made in Kennedy don't you get stars All the time direct your Adam igoy him has made a couple of great ones. Exonica revolves around an upscale script you out with great characters Good music and a haunting story the sweet here after is stunning enough said He has told us in the Georgia if he says he does like these two if you like record for dream blender gun roast your like these as well A couple Canadian films why would I not Canadian films? Well, maybe you've seen them. Maybe even like well. I didn't Exonica and the sweet here after okay. I'll put it in my pile Okay, I got my pile building here even though we are not talking about movies anymore So I like the shallow grave a lot. I'd give it a four on in my scale of five. I like that I'd recommend it. Selling because then last night I watched what just might be and I realized it won a lot of awards, but nobody ever talks about this the only thing they ever make any reference to is the thing about the frogs. That's it That's it. I don't want to give it away, but there is there is a scene with frogs But Magnolia just might be the best movie ever made Put that citizen king right up right in the favor. Please Well, I'm just they're always town citizen king. I know Magnolia makes recommend for a dream seem like a piece of Dreck. That's how good it is I'm telling you all right Tom Cruise is great in fact those of you people who don't mind seeing Tom Cruise at his advanced age running around his underwear Looking really embarrassing. There was a scene in there where he said and I'm sure he's got a salami in his underwear in his BBDs I heard it with a killbasa. Is that what it was? No, he don't like them Germans He gets a little porky when you talk about the German it's Polish Oh, that's it's a it's a Polish sausage you're right and believe me if anybody ought to have a Polock in his pants It's Tom Cruise and he's very good and now it's saying who's great and we need voter boy to look it up for me on to you Internet okay, look up What's his name Right now look up what's his name and see when he died Jason robots okay Well there's so many people in this movie. Philipsy more Hoffman is in there Philopaper Hall Melinda Dylan Jeremy Blackman Ricky J. William H. Macy Julian Moore Melora Waters I Waltz Handle which one she was but every character in here is is just amazing and it's it's all these like this connected the people and As the movie goes along you start putting all the pieces together. There is definitely a message in there And the best scene in the movie isn't the one with the frogs the best scene is the one where toy the end of the movie all of the characters It's like that Like the REM video where they're all all these disconnected people are seeing the song toward the end of the video. Remember standard smile or one of those yeah and All the people even though they were the broad who's OD cheese in the car All these movies you don't have that same thing with the lots of booze and drugs baby Lots of drugs and she's singing even though she's like passed out in a car She's singing and there are all the even Jason robots who's dying of brain cancer lying there and bed He's singing the song Oh and the message of the message of the song is it's all the ways the time so let's give up basically have a good part Jason robots died on the summer 26 2000 okay in this movie it was 1999 So I'm not too sure you had to do a lot of acting in this movie. You know he was great because he looked like It looked like they just hooked up a tube that was nose and there he was like he was dying right there on a movie set He was sensational I'm telling you magnolia if you don't watch that movie and if you don't say if you if we get any criticism at that movie We're gonna personally it's long it's three hours and eight minutes We'll come to your house and just beat your brains out with a baseball bat and then we'll have a whole bunch of frogs come back to me God, I know just what to find some yeah exactly In fact, I can go over to Montreal And bring a whole bunch of frogs back with me just out of spite.

He was just killing fags and abortion doctors and they're all going to hell anyway It's sick and an honest call to be FBI giving Rudolph's location could have easily been made Everyone in that town who kept their mouth shut is subhuman garbage Too bad for pretty boy Eric doesn't like fags and now he's gonna spend the rest of his life in prison Don't drop the soap sweetheart. Yo yo yo. Let's rape Rudolph is what it's a let's rape Eric So it's got a bit of ring to it Says Kelly Who's pissed off and fired up about it Okay, how's that thing looking so far a little mini pull before we get to our last ever movie pull least for the time being Which of these three would you rather hear about movies golf or the marlins guess who's in last place George G Could be the marlins could it? Surprise golf is beating in 41 quick votes movies 26 63 and a half percent Golf eight and the marlins seven And you know it's amazing to me at a radio station where they're constantly bashing and rightfully so first it was Wayne Hypinga and then it was little John Henry and now it's a David Samson and Delilah and Jeffrey Luria and rightfully so But it's always oh they're great Who the hell are you people kid in last time I checked this didn't last place five games under five hundred they stink to join out Let me say again last place the division But they want a game with about 400 runs last night. So right away. It's the marlin. Let's go see I mean it's just I don't I'm just amazed I'm astonished at how selfish these people are And even even the panthers who you know can't draw flies to a Schmidt pile even on their average day When I got there like eight or nine ten thousand people reading the stands and I know what they put in the paper in a box score They out draw them every day every game There are more people that a panther game and a town that wouldn't know a hockey puck from a goddamn steel bagel Then there are for the average marlin game and not even a contest Because like I said we haven't got to July and August yet when there's like two three thousand stiff sitting around and they're bacon There brings up Bacon when they are oh bacon. I already hit my bacon for today. Oh When I got some real bacon yesterday some salt-free bacon. I low-loat salt reduced bacon. Not salt-free and Haven't made that yet. Let some real stuff is supposed to that to microwave stuff You can make it microwave. It's got all the instructions just go out and get about 400 rolls of paper towels That's my suggestion. Hey, and I will also say this if you're gonna eat bacon Don't be in like a fattening stuff along with it because you'll balloon up like a blimp You're following what I'm saying Don't beat like a you know a leader of ice cream or something like that along with it Don't put your bacon in the ice cream right always something to think about bacon flavored I'm thinking like bacon cheese flavored bacon sounds good to me Cheese flavored bacon anyway stop at a food crap, okay 62 votes. This is just a quick mini poll today just a proof of point Which in these three topics would you rather hear us talk about movie 36 golf 15 Marlins 11 Yeah, that's a sure wave message which means nobody gives a fine crap about the Marlins Okay, nobody cares. They got free whey knees if they got free bubble head dolls Then 25,000 extra people sure up where is the free crack? Yeah, that's it. That's how Florida for you I have never this just goes on and on and on and on it's astonishing to be the attempt to force feed people Something that they don't want. It would be like us talking about movies again today Didn't they make it pretty clear in their pool yesterday in our pool? Yeah, they're furious man They can't stand it. It's effin pondress. I'm telling you. Watch magnoia. Believe me By this afternoon. I am begging you To go get it. You're gonna buy it? Yeah, then I'll lend it out. Oh, what a movie three hours and eight minutes and it's just a Stonishing and if you're likely of course in wrecking for a dream we like to think with the TV guy Would the you know here's we got another winner. There's like Two I'm thinking is a two or three Tom Cruise plays the TV these sexist TV guy. It's ripping a hell out of women And talk it about you know all the guys with her big penis and you got him and then you got the TV Gensho host guy who's dying of cancer Of lung cancer. They're all they're all dying of cancer and You got him and then the punky little kid on her who's the genius who a piece of his pants because they won't let him go in the take a upy break Magnoia if we don't get a call or two about Magnoia then I'm gonna be pretty pissed off and fired up And I'm amazed that during all these weeks and weeks this ponderous long time We've been hooking about movies has anybody actually really talked about this other than talking about the frogs No, no There's something wrong out there man. There's something really really wrong and All the awards that a one is as many Zillion awards that one and nobody ever talks about it That's why when we made this whole list in fact if you look on our website now We got the list of movies that all three of us George and Bonerboy and I recommend You know we got some of the old tried and chew godfather and kukus nest in that work on it, but also we're trying to like You know a lot of ones that are really great that nobody ever talks about To like our open up some new avenues for it. It gives something to do besides going out there and playing golf Let me tell you right now boys and girls on you people are didn't vote for golf on our pull so far this morning The thing with golf is guys who play a lot of golf There's a message they're trying to send They're bored I say they're bored to death take a take Look at mull for example Here's a guy that's approached in 70 years old That's got to get up a tree a clock at a morning and drive not just from bokeh But I find out from Joe's call last night from North Boca All the way down or Hershey highway drive 45 minutes to get to work Forward shmitless So what does he do he gets back home to bokeh takes himself a little bit of a nap he puts on his checkered pants snaps his vera closed veins a couple of times And goes out there on a course Huh I'm I'm tanya In between rapes. I think that's like probably his number one pastime Is golf You show me a guy to place a lot of golf like I said now show you a guy that has got too much spare time on his hand He just bored with life bored to tears Got it should find a girlfriend a boyfriend or maybe even both maybe a goat something Don't you think mo could find another old goat No 27 past 10 at five 60 WQM here's the places but around not as long as mo but 25 years in town And that's brand issues independent family shoe store that's been growing like topsy because the people love shopping They love taking their feet into the store because they offer you an unbeatable selection of the top brands rock ports Echoes Mufisto Timberland Clark's S.A.S. floor shim all the big shoe names You know and love and they got every size under the sun men's 6 to 15 women's five to 12 and which from a very very narrow to the very big wide fat ones and your feet too And they've got over 40,000 parachutes and stuck into gigantic 8,000 square foot mega store and Personal friendly service from people who know your feet inside and out Probably even recognize you by the way your feet smell brand issues the right 12 90 North federal highway in Paparoba, Chopin daily 99 Sundays 10 to five and right now it's a great time to shop for fathers day this weekend at brand issues Spirying men's A.

Maybe the problem is there were too many discussions of movies over too many days in a row You know what top the top the tape is When you get on a roll on something there, it's called like having some continuity to something Now if these people had something else very important to talk about like look at a tremendous response on a phone already here You see that not as usual When I mentioned Magnolia especially on the heels of all these movie things we've been doing for weeks now I'm probably much too long but nevertheless when I mentioned that every line at a board should let up Don't you think that there's at least eight or nine people out there who've seen it? No Oh no seriously don't you think they're nine people who'd have an opinion say boy you're right It may be the best movie of all time or it's your is one of the best or it's or it's not whatever Yeah, but then they got a call Oh, that's right. I forgot we got nothing to give them stuff they're best wishes We got no marlins tickets We could 567 oh yeah, but nobody would take in the 567. Oh 560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line it and it's true I've never seen a town where there is such a tremendously desperate attempt and especially on this station because of its sportscraft To force feed something that the public doesn't want you want some panther tickets. Oh no Just like my friend Phil Saltman we gave up we didn't give it up but we got his number there. Okay, so anybody wants those two Premocites right in front of my seats there for the they're gonna have to buy him of course The panther season tickets almost right at center-rise right at the blue line great seats We won't get any calls on that. I asked this morning you guys get any calls for Phil's number no Because nobody wants it nobody there's no interest nobody cares And especially after all the lies in the ridiculous prices in the bullcraft and the youngsters in the organization I mean a public even the dumbest of the dumb except for those very selfish people which they're bored to death and it's their thing So therefore let's build a mestadium and let's cater to them and to get all excited like they are about the a few or 4,000 people sitting there because they got nothing else to do except get rained on God it is so frustrating Here's a facts welcome to senior neo Rogers after each home runs so disappointed as some sort of god the neat cool Sign a hg and atheist. What what is that mean? I haven't no idea is pointed the god of cork Maybe he's from cork Ireland, huh? I don't I don't understand that maybe some county cork always is probably a little bit too dark to be from county cork But nevertheless I'm not gonna talk about sandy so soon is cork back what the hell difference is it make who gives a flying crap? Okay, and in the in the scheme of things in the world who cares about what their Sammy social was using the cork bad It was just an accident I believe it that one didn't belong in there 567.0560 pound five set a 60 on a magnolia line Look at that the marlins are still sucking wind on our pool nobody cares well that's your audience They're just a hostile and now it's the whole south Florida scene man. That's why nobody shows up see it cost nothing to call a talk show So anybody can call up like they do on our sports shows and say oh, it wasn't that quite a performance last night And then and at the mic low a bit Nobody cares nobody cares those aren't expensive tickets That's the cheapest ticket in town for any sporting event professional by far and still nobody shows up Here's West Palm Beach, hello yeah, I mean personally I love golf.

It's the best movie ever But that it's certainly one of the all-time greats That was the interesting on that that like blockbuster would have cut out considering I still have my father Well, since every other word in a movie is an F bomb I would say they leave that go as a matter of fact toward the end of the movie. Well, there's no no no Did he? No toward the end of the movie when Tom Cruise finally gets reunited gets hooked up with his dying father who ran it left the him and his mother Did I don't like give away story? But he's huh? Don't tell me I'll go right. No, no, no, but anyway Tom Cruise has hunched over the bed And Jason Robards is lying there with the two windows knows and he's already had the morphines who he's like totally out of it Like you know and Tom Cruise is saying Don't die you esping asshole He keeps pounding the bed don't die you esping asshole. It's it's great And that's some of the clean-alanguage in the home movie. Now, there's a lot of language in there But plot-pust you don't care about that? No, no then by all means go and get it. Okay, great. Let's try it away I don't care what that other guy said. He's in town. What was the opinion he was a good guy? But I'm I'm amazed Maybe I'm amazed 193 votes are many on our four-play pool. Which of these three would you rather right here as talk about movies? 125 almost 65 percent Marlins 39 some of which are really dubious votes involved 29 Let's talk some golf baby. What do you say? What about that? Anika? Sure, what ever name is huh? What about that? Dike that's a treat-funky leg on what and what was wrong with when Ben right a few years ago on CBS got canned because he talked about the dice or whatever way? He said it huh? What's wrong with that? He was just being honest right? I mean, so what if there are a bunch of dice out there or better athletes and some of the guys? Hello Tom Cruise's character would be upset about that last night in the magnolia movie. You'll like your love his character Believe me. Here's Miami. Hello There you go. Yes, sir. You're past Paul. Once you stick to it you sag it 567 0560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless on my past pole What does that mean? I added oh well why don't you stick to it? Here's the call from Lottagil hello Yes, sir. Oh, no listen. I wanted to That's one of the mom that people Director Paul Thomas Anderson's father was a Cleveland legend on television. He did a character called Goulardy Yeah, one of the no-view knew who he was he's like the horror films No, he did not okay. He also became the voice of ABC the thing is earning Anderson Yeah, I didn't know if you knew who he was or not now at any rate. I just saw Magnolia over the weekend I thought it's a great movie I can't say I really 100% understood it I guess it's separate stories that have the same theme Well, yeah, it was it was nine separate stories, but I mean they all tied together And he end and the theme was all pretty much the same. I mean it was depressing from that standpoint and the the futility of a life And the fact that there were a lot of bizarre, you know in fact in the beginning you'll notice where they showed these strange things that have happened throughout history They show three separate incidents and then the narrator comes back on again Near the end of the movie and says the same thing it over strange mid-happens, you know, it is basically what it's all about Yeah, yeah, I really see when you're when you're start getting too analytical and trying to figure out And it like the ending which we don't want to give it away But the ending just leaves you after you've been watching for three hours and eight minutes and it's suddenly it ends very suddenly You say what what just happened there? You know, and then that's it and they're coming to credits Yeah, yeah, now also I have to tell you I thought that boogie noise was a tremendous film Yes, what this kid he did all the writing and he's really he's like in the when he's just putting nice I think he was 25 years old Right, so he was maybe in his late 20s when he did Magnolia. This is PT Anderson That's right, Paul Thomas Anderson right, yeah, I thought he can fuse with Philipsy more often Right, so the other guy still up Baker Hall right, yeah, but Also a time cruise was tremendous Yes, he was he want he won an Oscar for it or he won something what he win? He won I got it right here But the kid this Paul Thomas Anderson he wrote all that dialogue and it was tremendous really Well, I'm gonna find somebody else who enjoyed it. Thanks guys Okay, and Do you love the part of the movie tour the end where they're all singing the same song? It was great. I got it was that one of your songs. I think that she was up for an academy or that was really something Yeah, I was going to write about over the week and I even saw the supplemental material He won the Berlin film stuff the whole world. I haven't watched that yet because that's a whole separate dish Right, but I watched that also So anyway, thanks, Bill Thank you. Okay, there's one there's one He agreed he liked it. He's understated. I don't care what the understander not okay I guarantee there are many things in that other flick we're talking about odd nausea We don't understand and certainly in momentum. I don't care how many times you watch it You're still not gonna understand unless you write yourself a lot of notes. Don't believe his lies Head for the tattoo parlor. Maybe Teddy is hanging out there There was something about Teddy's character. He was good. He was a really excellent Joe Pantoliano is always good He's a very underrated character actor. He was excellent Anyway, we don't want to talk too much movies on the hours to come we're gonna be talking a lot about Baseball and Call see I'll say it again. I don't understand for the life of me the one time you would think if this radio station It any brains at all and I really don't hear that much of it, but it would seem to me They'd be they'd be leaning on this Brian greasy thing because if the dolphins do get that deal done today Beener boy was tell me we had calls off the areas that they did they get the deal done as he had often You know if they get the deal done today or whenever in the near future That's gonna be the big topic of conversation all over South Florida Even Georgia's there concerned about that Hmm, but is is Brian is ugly and the boring his is daddy was the answer is yes, of course He won't have the talent at least now. Yeah, Brian the beast I guarantee a one thing that if Brian greasy winds up other dolphins he'll be Jay Feele around Maybe not before the season but during the season after Jay has one of those 15 in their 17 games You know that Brian greasy will be the starter on a team that's just my opinion I don't want to get sports intensive on a show. We try to give you a break from that But that's my opinion or whatever is monthly entries Right, well, and the see now you're picking that you'd be like Georgia being anti semantic again Sorry, or maybe maybe the dolphins have a game scheduled on a tissue bob or something like that He don't want to play 10 58 don't get started with that stuff now. He'll get really up tight Oh, I love Jay Feele.

Assholes in water, assholes every day. Assholes for the day, assholes for the crime. That's 40,000 assholes, they're gonna sold them. It's the picture of Mo. He just dropped it up and opened Mike. How about you pardon? Vodka Brian, he came in with the mic open in the middle of the segment. Just popped that right in front of me. That's why I was cracking up during your spot yesterday. What do you like about it? I'm making a picture of Mo Howard. I'm gonna turn it out yes. Let me try to organize this stuff because I got two packages. Let's see, this is 24. You have that? 24. H-C-N. There you go, how do you like that? I got some good new stuff there. We got a good new Boka Brian disc, which I guess that's also in the package. I didn't even bother looking for that. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. I was looking for a new one. He's got the lamp shade on the head. He's got that. He also, I just noticed this is the same picture of his face when we have on our website. Right. Sends the hair, sends the hair piece, and also sends the teeth. He's out all fours, just anticipating. Some attack from behind. The gang rape is fun. It's wrong. I'm saving. I thought the other picture was great, but that was small potatoes compared to this. This is the best. This is the best all time. Now when did we get this on our website? How do we mill it to me? It'll be on. It'll be on. We'll get 50 million hits just to see that picture. That's worth the price of emission. Okay, so the deal is that for Rell has already had a bigger one in with mo. It only took like four shows. And they hate each other like poison, which we say. Oh, right. Joe Castell, if you're awake, which I doubt he's probably still asleep, but if somebody passed the message to Joe, you'll probably have your five to six hour back pretty soon. I just have that thing. I could be wrong. Okay, let's get into the real poll. Now let's get this other hazard right off of here. We asked in our preliminary poll, which of these would you rather hear about? Moves, 167%, two thirds. Marlins 43, golf 36. Oh, out of almost two hundred and three nine votes. Okay, now here is our last movie poll ever. For now, right, right. One last one. Because the on-est told us yesterday they're getting tired of this. Too much shame is too much of the same crap too many days in Rell. They can't stand a hate. It's fondress. Which of these movies did you like the most? Now this isn't one of those where we're doing the God. We already done those a million times. This has to do with the movies that we've been recommending. These last few weeks that we've been moving intensive. And we've been working on the first two days. We've been recommending these last few weeks that we've been moving intensive. And we've discovered some that I think are really, really extraordinary. And that we would like you to see. We'd like to encourage you to have the balls to go and see something new and different. Right, we am for a dream. Happiness. And we were talking about dogs just the other day. Plenary Glen Ross, Memento, Magnolia, Shadow Grave, Geneca, The Game, The Game. And they say any of them or they all sucked. I don't think we'll get too many of them. They all sucked at least not real ones because how many people saw all of these. Especially shallow grave. No, that's not real ones, like you said. No, the tell-of-o for that just to be negative. Well, we know that. I am a piece of suck. Well, for example, here's a facts. I'm just am amazed because you know me, I'm not that easy to please. I'm pretty picky. I don't just watch every movie, So I was the best damn thing ever saw in my life. And I was even better. And I'm not like that. But, you know, when you see something that's really great and has an impact. And during the course of I'm thinking, Oh my god, this is unbelievable. Just like during the course of that, I'm thinking, holy crap, this is beyond a company of I missed this. This facts his magnolia isn't above average movie, but it's a way way too long. Too much cruise, I just don't think he can act at all. Well, I'm not a Tom Cruise fan to say the best. And I thought he was excellent in this. In fact, he was up for all kinds of awards. Recreem for dream on the other hand is amazing. More than it is simply refreshing, especially today's movie market. One of the reason movies are so bad nowadays is that the studios around a tight schedule So scripts are just pumped out as fast as possible. And here's more recommended movies. True romance, Swingers, and favorite Chinatown. Our Saw Chinatown, but I was a long time ago. Swingers is a good movie. What is Swingers? Yeah. That's a decent movie. That's a movie for George. Yeah, that's his bag. As I'm going to do with what you think. All the guys here are the facts around Kendall Teddy. I finally saw Requiem. I purposely spell like that. Requiem, it sucks. Yeah, don't believe his lies. It says that rather or less an emotional any day rather than have to put up with that boring or for way to piece of crap. Oh, can you tune up that scooter that comes on before your show? What does that mean? For real. Oh, tune up, I see. I want to start the scooter. I thought he was talking about Thorazuto. Fine, never saw a Razuto into the ferral together. Yeah. Then he's got some Sammy Sothik. Well, Teddy, get yourself some helpful. Okay, I'm not interested in Sammy Sothik and his pork battery. Other than thing, okay. I like Sammy. Sammy's okay with me. Only too much at the, it'll hit him. Mark and Guire had that, the battle going there that year. Too much of that phony balloony with a heart and a hold on and I'll let other crap. You know, high-fiving and low-fiving and the one finger. I think he's only going to be holding up the one finger for the immediate future. What is this? Neo Rogers, Michael Powell is shirking his duty by not enforcing FCC rules. The Democrats must take back the media otherwise we lose. Oh, what do you stop? This is Gerald in the somewhere. The great majority of people on here won't be able to point out Michael Powell. Yes, cut that crap. Like I'm going to do something about, okay. The only good piece of news is, a stir bring a bit to one of our bedtime stories on our website today. From the AP, new media ownership rules face challenges. Out of the Washington Post. Newly relaxed rules governing ownership of newspapers and TV and radio stations face a gauntlet of challenges in the courts in Congress. Although it says he's a gauntlet. The East Restrictions approved by the Republican controlled FCC a lot of companies to untill the end of the state's reaching nearly half the nation's viewers and newspapers and TV and radio stations in the same city. Uh, well, where is the, uh, the channel? Where where the hell is it? Critics are already campaigning to roll back to changes. As more and more Americans fight out about the FCC's order and rules changes, they're going to push for Congress to overturn them and said, Gene Kimlman, public policy director for consumers union, which publishes consumers reports magazine. You go boy. You go, Gene. Several lawmakers in the port legislation already decounted the change rules, especially the one that permits a single company to untill the stations that reach 45% of US households up from 35%. So they're working on it, but don't like, uh, expect I'm going to do something about it. What is active as starting in Swayga?

That should be all you need to know. In fact, a quote, Joe Costello from that phone call we had last night. I don't want to get him in hot water or even look warm. But he'd have a rather amusing line. He said we're talking about Molo. He said he isn't well liked. And I said, no. Joe being the master of understanding that he is.

Schallegrae that happened is none out of the first 26 quick votes. I'm amazed. And I think you'll look maybe you'll disagree. Maybe you'll be with these other people. Because we've had a couple of calls on Magnolia. And that's it. Including one guy who didn't like it. Right. And a thanks from a guy that says it was pretty good. But Tom Cruise was sucked. This has got to be Tom Cruise. My one say his best ever. He was good in the 4th of July. He was also great in Rayman. So let's see. I'll be fair. Even though we hate him like poison. And we think that he's one of those. Short. One of my people. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's Miramar. Hello. Hey. Good. Good for you. Look at this. Look at this response. Like I said. Just the astonishing to me. We got two freaking calls on a board. Here's a lady in four Lauderdale. Hello. This man. I wanted to chime in on Magnolia. It's one of my favorites. I saw it. Well, thank God for you. It's fantastic. And I've seen it multiple times because I happen to be on satellite. And I could see snippets of it. Right. Not all that did I understand. I actually remember going to a website. And there's a lot of un-diblically challenged. But there's a lot of biblical references throughout the movie. For instance, there's a-so long ago. There's a portion where there's a game show going on. And if you, when the camera pans from the audience, people have billboards that have passages from the Bible or reference. Why didn't you even notice that? I didn't need them until I saw the websites saw it again. Yeah. But I found that when I told people how great I thought it was. And they went to see if they didn't have the same response. And maybe I was hyping it too much. Maybe they're just stupid. Good. I'm not seriously because it's a very cerebral movie. And if you don't have an IQ larger than your thumb, you don't get it. Right. It's great. Well, thanks for you. Thanks. Have a great day. See, there you go. There's a two of us. God, I'm, you know me. I always say that line and I stop and think I would know why. Why should I be amazed at anything it goes on in this show? Well, in case you forgot, a lot of people called to recommend it while we had been doing this. Well, we're the hell are they now? Where the hell are they now? When we need them. For example, here's another fact. Absolutely correct. Requiem is one of the best movies ever made. Two other movies you should look into. Donnie, Darko and Dark City. Dark City's new. Can I finish the facts? Please before you get all whipped up. Dark City's the original matrix, but done so much better. Donnie, Darko is just as good if not better than Requiem and the facts. Dark City was a good idea and it could have been a good movie, but it wasn't. Looked. I thought it was fine. It was not. That's not great. Great. I bet I know who it's about. He died. Yeah, and I want to see Donnie, Darko. Is that like Donnie Brasco? It's got a big killer. He's got a black, a dark skin, the Donnie Brasco, Donnie Darko? No. Oh. It's got a wadded. In other words, he doesn't put on black face. You do it all over again. Johnny? Johnny, dip, not Johnny, Darko. Here's somebody since we're listed these, at least some of many way. Think of it. Maybe you didn't send me all the pages. I like that. Good. Just a top 20, this A-A-F-I. The American Film Institute, the one a piece. Revealed the top 50 heroes in top 50 villains of all time and there were 100 years hundred here that was on the last night, hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Who were in both a hero and villain honor for his portrayal of the Terminator. Oh. See, the Atticus Finsting. I'm sorry. I do like the part in the movie where Dustin Hoffman is way but a hanky go. I mean, Al Pacino going. Atticus. Atticus. I like that. That's cute. And Boo rapidly came out again. You notice there's another pair. All right. Just like Morgan Freeman and Denza Washington. To me, Dustin Hoffman and El Pacino were almost interchangeable. I know that sounds, I know what sounds silly but I'm just telling you in my mind. They got that nose. Maybe that's it. I don't know what it is but they're almost interchangeable. Anyway, Atticus Finstia, top hero, followed by Indiana Jones, James Bond, Rick Blaine from Casablanca, Wilcane and High Noon. Clarice Sterling, cutty's doctor, doctor, doctor, and sounds lame. Hannibal Lecter was the number one villain. Back to a hero's eight was Ellen Ripley, nine George Bailey from its wonderful life. Ah, the corn is so high. It's up to my ears. Give me a couple of ears that I corn. T.E. Lawrence, Lawrence of Arabia 10. Jefferson's, this is corn, man. This is crap. This is crap. Oh, Jesus. And the top villain, who votes on this? The AFI. Also in the court. Yeah, I'll send you the doctor. I don't send it to me. We go through this over here. I don't want to know. Villains Hannibal Lecter Norman Bates Darth Vader. Wicked Witch of the West and White. What could witch of the West is that it's a silly movie. It's a kids movie. Wizard of Oz. Nurse Ratchet. Well, she, again, she wasn't a villain in that sense. I mean, she was an nasty bitch who's an antagonist. But not a villain in the sense. This is stupid. Is what it is. Yeah, Mr. Potter from its wonderful life. You see a theme going here? Uh-huh. Alex forced in fatal attraction. Phyllis Dicturson, double in Demby. Reagan McNeil in the exercises. She wasn't a villain. Reagan was a villain. She was the victim. The demon was the villain. You asshole. Jesus Christ. But that is as piss me off. The queen in Snow White in the Seven Dwarfs. Ah, I want to make the Corleona's the villain. Michael Corleoni. Do you want to post that on the website? No. Absolutely not. But want to compost it on the website. Oh, Michael Corleoni. I know. You throw me out of the house. You throw me out. Alex, the large clockwork, or any? He also wasn't the villain. Right? Right. He was the anti-hero. Yeah. Right. But I mean, he wasn't a villain. No. I mean, villain we think of like a Hannibal Lecter, which is number one or Dracula or Frankenstein or the Master of Villain and the Rue Ruten for it. No, villain is like the evil door. The evil door is a W would say. In fact, W should be on it. Mr. Deltoid was the villain. How mine thousand from 2001's Space Odyssey. He had like his dialogue. The alien. Aemon Goath from Shindler's List. Unless you get to. I don't get it. No, across from Chinatown. I don't want to read these. This is the press. I'm putting this on a bottom of my pile. I'm going to use it to wipe my ass with later on. I'm going to take a big healthy wild diarrhea and wipe my ass with that later on. Because that's all it's good for. It's crap. Glad I missed it. I also heard that the audience. So remember that one facts we got about how the three of us know nothing about movies. Right. I got news for. I admit that we aren't experts and we're aware of discovering and uncovering new stuff all the time, which is what part of the fun for us of this whole thing, even though the audience hates it. But we're geniuses compared to these AFI, these pseudo-intellectuals. And those brits that wrote that book you have. Oh, that time outbook. But it does make for a nice door stop. 28 past 11 at 5. 60 WQM. If you're bald, fast train can't help you out. If your thing is limp, they can't do anything for you.

Why is this the moon at five sixty. Don't forget if the ones did it means. They're big one to two hour comedy bits today. Thank God for that. And we'll have a lot of a new stuff to play. That was a good move I made by getting down the elevator. Yeah. Well it's important back up was probably even a better one. And thank goodness nobody else was on the elevator. Come back up because I open up that package and let out just a hysterical shriek. I mean I look at that picture and just his hysterical. Here's a lady in plantation. Hello. Yes man. I love to make no way. Well good. Maybe it's a ladies movie. I'll allow you to do so. I do. I do. Do you know why? Uh, Mauro and Trive. Momento. Requiem for dreams. Yeah. They're all forced to our movies. They have no gore and violence. They have no shoot them out. I think men. I think it is a little too cerebral for your audience. No. Momento was not a ladies movie at all. No way. I don't think men like to think when they go to the movies. I don't know what it is. I thought Momento yes. I think I think yeah. I mentioned it like that one. Now I haven't seen broken eyes. Yeah. But I loved it. Like every movie you've mentioned. The reaction is great. The only movie I didn't see that I saw because if you recommending it, which is why I like the movie shows is happiness, which I love. And there was also a jargon. Magnolia that. Eight boy was supposed to eat. Yeah. You see what happens to him at the end. But also every. Yeah. In fact, that may be we talked about the fact that most of these movies have got a lot of drug people and drugs. This is the only one of the movies that had a dog that wound up on drugs. But that was sad when he was. That was very sad. But the performances were amazing. And you're the only other person I've ever met that loved that music scene too. I thought that was amazing. Oh, that was that was phenomenal. That was phenomenal. That's the. Oh, just that scene alone was so spectacular. Were all these different people, including one who was dying, one who was almost in a coma. Right. And they're trying to kill herself. Right. And they're all moving their lips. And they're singing this depressing morbid song in the little kid from the game show. He's singing a song. And he says the message is give up. Exactly. Well, I actually own the soundtrack to that movie because Amy Man wrote all the original music. And I thought that's function to one that year for Oscar. I think the movie, the I think the song that was nominated was not that song, but the one that she was singing at the end called Dave Me. Right. And um, but all the stories were, you know, these, I think the sign of a good movie like Requiem and this movie may know is where the characters want you and they stay with you. And even Danny, the wisk kid. I mean, how pathetic you want to get brazen because he was in love with his bartender. Right. I mean, and and her and those. And who was the, who was the actor that played the screaming queen who was the, the bartender? Oh, he was from last in. Well, this is name. Oh, that wasn't not already Johnson. Who was that? The other guy from last in. Oh, for a minute. What the weird. Who? The way they did his thing. Yeah, Ronan Martin. No, the guy with a skinny nose. Yeah, he was from last in wasn't he? What the hell is his name? Well, somebody will know. He would like to, like, like to, like to, like to, thanks. Love it. Bye. 110 votes. So far our last movie pull until whenever we change our mind, but we got to get bring this to an end because the audience is starting to get really upset. Aren't they? No. No, they're not. Screw him. Where I'm telling you, I enjoy this because I never would have seen Magnolia. I never would have seen, uh, really for a dream. Or any of these things because in fact, Joe was saying to me on a phone, I said, Joe Custella, I was raving him about some of these movies. He said, and this is the anti DVD guy I'm talking to because you remember when you got me that DVD player the first time. I thought, well, I don't have time for this, you know, just not my bag, which is why I never got one in the first place. But now that I really have the time and the schedule to be able to watch this stuff, I mean, you know, minimum one a day now for me, minimum, which means by the middle of all just I'll be broke, but I'll have a great collection. 110 votes didn't see any of those on your list 34. Requiem for Dream 18, Glen Gary Glen Ross 13. They all suck 13. Take that with 10 grains of salt. Momento 11. Just change them again. The gain eight, Gadigas six, Magnolia only five, happiness two and shallow grave one. Well, that's interesting. Shell agrees to go on already. It's British nobody saw it. No, no, but I'm saying it's interesting that it's got one. Oh, that's because it's Carlos. You liked that one the best of all of these. He didn't know that. I bet you I bet you it was. And we didn't put bullion here so we couldn't vote for that or kids. He would probably vote for kids. I think we got a closet to something there. I don't know what the closet human being. He's been out of the ship because he's not getting paid on the 10. And you for the birthday. And we forgot his birthday today. Everybody should call. What's your happy birthday? Okay. I didn't.

This is Wayne. I'm a roller-long time listener. Last week you were talking about the radio about the best boy. And I've seen these on movie credits. I was wondering what is the best boy. He's a go-forer. From what I understand the go-forers. I thought they'd want to go and bring the coffee in the sandwich. Back in stuff like that. The go-forers. The grip and the gap. Right. You're a rapper. I was just curious about. I know you were talking about the last week. I'll give you a call because you're talking about the movies and everything. Hold it. Hold it. Okay. There you go. Thanks. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I'm calling to board. This is, uh, I want to just sit here and cry. You know what? I want to just sit down and put my head in my hands and cry. I mean, I got the picture of Mo on all fours here in front of me, which I'm using as the crap bottom. I made a set of very least. Just enough to make me change out of where every 10 seconds like the little kid Magnolia on a quesho. And a response from hell absolutely nothing. Why are you? And now what is that? What? What? You just sent me a revised schedule. I mean, it's a reverse. It's a reverse. It's a reverse. It's a reverse? It's a reverse? Yeah. I see Mo's name is crossed out on tomorrow's schedule. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not tomorrow. Not tomorrow on Friday's schedule. Tomorrow's only Thursday. I'm pushing it a little bit. And we got Goldie's solo on Friday. Hmm. Pretty interesting. Maybe Mo is going to go out looking for a new address. That could be it. And if you're a tee, if he finds way, he won't be telling. For how long it is. Don't you dare be putting it on the air where I live the complex. Okay, so we don't know if he lives in cemetery, or legit not. I don't think so. 560, 750, 50, pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. I guess we're lucky that it's Wednesday and not. Oh. Thanks for finding me. We go on. Let's be to tell you to send a check. He can no check until I get back. He's just been having to wait just a few days. Okay. Hey, Miguel. Yeah. Hello, is he also okay, Mr. Hachad and there. Come just a relax. Oh yeah. Tell him to hop on the Dorine's bones for a while. It'll come in down a little bit. Here's Oakland Park. Hello. Mr. Roger. Speaking. And he'll, I wanted to talk to you about a guy. A PT Anderson Paul Thomas Anderson. The guy that did Magnolia and he did Dolby Knight. Right. He also did a movie called The Heart 8. I don't know if you've seen that. But it's based in Vegas and it's got a great cast also. And he, he tends to use a lot of the same actors and all his movies. And you should check it out if he get a chance. The great eight? No, no, the heart eight. Oh, the heart eight. Yeah. It's actually, you know, the guy that had the, the talk show host. I think it's Philip Michael Baker. I think it's his name. The actor. And right. Philip, it's Philip Baker. There he goes. Philip Baker. And then the guy, John O'Neill, who's been a ton of movies and is becoming a really, really good character actor. Right. And then the two main actors in the movie and then when it's cultural plays a hooker, a prostitute in the movie. And an insemional, L Jackson plays like a black male or a tight, but a dude and it takes place in Vegas. Can you tell me the name of the actor that was talking about the gay old, the troll that's sitting at the bar in the movie? No, I know. I can see him, but I don't know the, I don't know the name of the actor, but I was that I was pretty funny. Yeah, that whole thing in a bar where the rotation after the bartender, that's a pan that's a hoot. Yeah, I think, you know, that movie, you know what, that movie actually did not get the best review. Some people loved it, but a lot of critics hated it because they thought that he ripped off a lot of, a lot of the, the theme of the movie from other movies. So they, they panned it in the way that's saying that he was kind of ripping off a whole bunch of different movies. Well, that's interesting. Yeah, because they got three Academy Award nominations, Vester original screenplay, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Vester original song, and is a whole list here on the sleeve of all these different awards they got, the 1989 Golden Bear Award, Toronto Film Critics Award, and it's said a lot of them. And if you can believe Paul Thomas Anderson, I do not believe that he's 30 years old yet. If you can believe, I guy is a genius because he is, he's, I think when he wrote Boogie and I thought thinking, he might have been 24 when he wrote Boogie and he's a genius. And for me, I'll say it again, to me, this is the best movie I ever saw. I don't know a lot of people say, how could you say that? I just said it's the best movie I ever saw in my life. And I tell you what, the way it's looking movies is I actually, I actually choose to see movies because of the writers and the directors that do. I'm not really the actors. And that guy, anything that he does, I actually go out and see and just haven't been, you know, disappointed. Excellent. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. All right. 10 till noon and 567.0560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Today I'd guess for one moment here. Jim Loeb, credibility gap anyone. It's from the internet press service. It's on our website today. All these articles that I read like little bits and pieces as opposed to the bedtime stories that I sent me along. I think everybody upset. Just to give you a little tease. Jim Loeb says, when all three major US newsweeklies, time, newsweek, and US news and world report run major features on the same day on possible government lying, you can bet you have the makings of a major scandal. And when the two most important outlets of the offensive opinion, the weekly standard in the Wall Street Journal, come out on the same day with lead editorials, spluttering outrage about suggestions of government lying, you can bet that things are going to get very hot as some are approaches in Washington. The controversy over whether the administration of President George W. Bush either exaggerated or lied about evidence that said it had about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before the West London invasion has mushroomed over the past week. And it goes on a life. You want to read this column. Jim Loeb credibility gap anyone questioned Mark. Sign our website near rangers.com. And then I turn on, I come in here this morning and put it up. And Moe is talking about the president's lies. And I thought, well, I thought, well, maybe he's out of his territory, but he's talking about Bush. Now, what he's talking about is Hillary's book, which we do have a story about that also on a website. He's talking about Hillary's book and about how he lied about his affair with Monica. Now, this coming from a guy who lies about his age, who lies about whether or not certain people were pushed off a show by him. I mean, you ask him what time it is and you have to look at your watch to make sure he's not lying to you. And he's talking about Bill Clinton lying. And I heard a succession of calls by the way that weren't too pleased with his take. That we're talking about the lies about the weapons of mass destruction, and I'm not sure how a lot more significant than lies about blow jobs. And the one called a liar, that was right on top of it, was telling Moe that he was eminently unqualified to be discussing something of that nature. Absolutely corrects you right on. Don't take any crap from a答ering old man who's done on his hands in ease with a lamb shit on his neck. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT and T line. Here's land 10, I hello. Hey, I think you're talking about Henry Gibson. Henry Gibson, that's what was. He was great. Yeah, I know he was a great movie man. Great movie. How could these people not agree? I mean, why I understand people had different tastes, but what is it that they might not have liked? I don't know. Too much shit to think about, maybe I don't know. Maybe too many frogs. Now what you make of that? Because I don't know that there's one interpretation, but what you make of it? The frog. Well, I don't want to give it away. We didn't give it away. Well, I mean, I wanted to cause people a lot of people didn't see the movie. They've heard that there's a frog scene in there, but we don't want to tell them that it's raining frogs. No, because that actually does happen. I mean, not, I'm sure not in that amount. That does happen. I've heard. I know what. Well, everybody knows that, but what do you think it means? I don't think it means anything. Really? Yeah. I think just like the narrator keeps saying during the movie, crab happens. Yeah. Because our crab happens. Yeah, it's always something. Exactly. That's right. That's exactly correct. All right. Yeah. Can I recommend a couple more, yeah? Sure, go ahead. Have you seen Secretary? No. You might like that. Okay. Pretty kinky. And, uh, sexy beast. Have you seen that? No. That's great, man. That's sexy beast. Yeah. Certainly isn't it about our beast, I'll tell you that. This is the beast. Wrong beast. Then king's leasing it. And it's a, it's, it's a, he's an animal. It's great. Okay. Yeah. Definitely see that. Even though the audience will be very upset because you're continuing this movie thing, Are you ever going to stop this? No. We'll stop it when we feel like it. How do you like that? We're out of the movie. Huh? When we stand this right, when we've, when we've discussed every last movie that's ever been made. And not only that, it look at here's black cat white cat. Oh, my, not being, it's it. Oh, I see. It's a four language movie. It's a four. We don't know what he said. You ever see black cat white cat? No. So there's one. Here's one called the man on the drive and movie channel to help release from prison taking interest in a woodland nymph is a means of exploring the opposite sex, Donald P. P. on and Andre Pellettier for a frog movie. Another one of those. From the drive and movie channel. Oh. You're so beautiful. Both of you. I got. He gained. I love you. Oh, how emotional. Real corn just what you'd expect on a channel that you can't get, but that's where it goes. 567560 pound 560 on the AT&T line. We're asking our last movie full ever because the audience is starting to get a really Anzy, which of these movies did you like the most? 169 votes didn't see any of them 51. See, that's why I think we're doing a serve of 53, like I said. Glenn Gary Glenn Ross 24. They all sucked 24 totally bogus that number. Requiem for Dream 23, Memento 15, the game 12. Gatica 11, Magnolia 11, happiness to in shallow grave only one. Channel grave is pretty surprising. If you've seen, if you want those movie mavens that seem just about every movie that anybody ever heard of, and you didn't see shallow grave, you might want to pick that up. I've got you and McGregor in it. No, I'm not in it. Me and McGregor? Yeah. Oh, f of you. Now you and McGregor as he play Alex? Oh, I play that name in the David. David's a goofy guy with a glasses. That's one's a lot of time in the attic. Alex I thought was Alex was okay. I was pulling form there at the end. Tapy? Yeah. Tapy McCallum. Here's Miami. Hello. Anyhow, I know it. Pretty good. And you should keep the smooth thing until whenever you feel like taking it off, man, and I want a little rec of you to back on my little coffee. Yeah. Beautiful. Beautiful. Have you ever seen American Paggo? Yes. Just saw a couple weeks ago as great. Yeah, it's a great movie. And so the movie I saw was a rules of attraction with James Vanderbeak and a whole like young cast young all the way. I was somebody suggested that I was going to watch it, but then I figured why it changed my mind about getting it. What we talked about in the other day. What I decide? It's the Dawson's Creek Kid and you don't like it. Oh, I can't say that kid. The Kid from Dawson's Creek. He's actually pretty funny in the movie. And that's not me now. I was the, I don't like him at all, but I saw the movie because of the chicks and all up at the story. He's good. It's like the sending Carlos and drugs everywhere and it's like eight kids and they're all cheating on each other. But it sure a lot of drugs in these movies, you know what? Yeah. I guess not everybody is just saying like Nancy Reagan said, okay, I'll write it down. If you watch at least once, just like Requiem. Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Bally. No problem. See you. He says we should continue doing until we feel like not doing. I don't like that. Yeah. That's the way it goes. And we'll see. We'll see what's up and what's down, you know? Go on. I mean, forget to read the Paul Cragman. It's not really that long. It's pretty short. In the next hour. Okay. Because we only got one more out of that. We got the one to two are. I'll tell you this ten and two man. I don't know why. But it goes by like Greece lightning and a witch's ass. It just flies by. Well, speaking about ants, I wonder how moth made out of the anster doctor. He's running around. He's looking fine. Oh, is he? Yeah. Well, that's good. I sure hope it doesn't have any of that. Gas left in that they pump India when you go for that colonoscopy. They pump India. I don't know seriously. You don't think they've done it yet. Oh, they haven't. They haven't done what yet. They haven't done what yet. They haven't done what yet. They haven't done what yet. They haven't done what yet. They haven't done what yet. They haven't done what yet. No, I think they did the pre. The pre cleaning. I don't know. I'm just making that up. The excavation. Oh, wow. Selt of the scouts. They said something about two loose-launch tracks. Is what I heard. That was the report I heard. Do you think they've done the cleaning? What are you talking about, man? You're disgusting. You're sick. Are you didn't see Magnolia either, right? Yeah. Get it. Right. And yeah, we'd say bye. But it's pretty much one of those expensive. Right. I think I'd be amazed if you'd been both agree with me that it was just a phenomenal.

Five by Xest and don't flutter the doorhead's in the skinny ass and away out. God, we can't stand him. Nobody can stand him. If I touch a good pull question, who is more or the testable? Just in Tinkerbell or more how I've dived it. That's a battle. Not for me. Tw- Why'd you think? You don't even know what I'm gonna say. Ah! Ah! Oh, I know what you're gonna say, alright. It was Justin. Yeah, sure it was. Vicky sends me a facts where she's got all these as it is. It's a quick no problem. Vicky they'll all be on the next hour. I wanted to our because we love our audience. And spite of what they think. We love you, Vicky. Here's also a facts. It says the Queen and Magnolia. Well, the other Queen, not Henry Gibson. But the other one, the one that was also the ugly one. I had the hot, the one that had to get the braces. Was William H. Macy from Fargo. But you should know you, you with the one recommending Fargo. Right. He's good. And he was very good in this. Let's see. Anaptation with Nicholas Cage. It's a Hayton, a Cage. But he's reading this movie. You have got to see this movie says Marcello. Anaptation. Okay. Well, I'm building another list for another, another plunge at the movie store. Now, can I just read a quick synopsis? Like a few seconds here. Let me pull the mic over to the thing. Magnolia. And it gets chopped off here, which pisses me off. But I'll just read like, on one random day in the San Fernando valley, a dying father, a young wife, a male caretaker, a famous lost son, a police officer and love, a boy genius, an ex-boy genius. That's William C. Schmorscheworth. Again, show host and an estranged daughter will each become part of a dazzling multiplicity of plots, but one story. Through a collusion of coincidence, chance, human action, shared media, past history and divine intervention, they will all weave and warp through each other's lives on a day that builds to an unforgettable climax. Some will seek forgiveness. Others escape. Some will mend freight bonds. Others will be exposed. Magnolia is a mosaic of American life woven through a series of comic and poignant vignettes. Got it? Yeah, I got it. Funny. That's just give you a little taste, a little teaser, a little something up the way you're weak. What your beak? 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T. And Verizon, I was lying. Nothing for you. Can't you just see that scene? Biner boy is going to play Joey Zaza. And Clarins is going to come through on the tenth on payday. All the envelopes. Look at Biner boy and say, nothing for you. Although he does make a bell if a girl. So you keep saying the tenth, it would have been tomorrow. I know, director positive. I don't want to hear about it. Now actually, when he's getting this payday is direct deposit. Here's the call from Dallas, hello. Hi. Yes, sir. All right. Let me give you some of my credentials for. I'll tell you what I'm about to tell you about a best boy. I'm a union electrician. I worked out of local 20 of the IBEWN Los Angeles, which is the studio local. Okay. The best boy is sometimes you'll see a listing for electrician or gaffers, which are basically the same thing. Right. The best boy is the head electrical formant. He's usually the biggest company's suck ass on the job. Okay. Right. That's why he gets his name up there. So when I said he's the go for that, it's partly true. Am I right? No, he is the electrical formant. He's got a go for his work for him. Okay. He's the big company formant. All right. Now I got a question for you because I'm fixing to go to Amsterdam. Oh, don't do it man. Please, I'm begging you. I'm serious. Don't do it. Why is it a toilet? Don't ask me. It's a toilet because there are no true, almost no tourist going there anymore. Because there's very rampant unemployment so there are a lot more beggars and schleppers in the street drug pedal is running around where the low-life scum of the city. And it's just a shadow of what it used to be. You'll be very disappointed. You've never been there before. You can go there every year. Oh, so now that you've been there many times. Indeed. Well, what was the last time you were there? It has been a year and a half. Okay. Well, keep in mind that I lived there for a few months. The last couple of years plus I haven't gone there for 16 years. So I've been there probably a hundred times. You'd, I mean, go ahead if you want, but I would just warn you. You'll be very disappointed. So last time I went there was a lot of construction. I wasn't just the streets were torn up and stuff. No, no, no, no, that's always great. That's just a given. That doesn't bother me. But it's just a dank and depressing and there's very few tourists. And you're not going to be happy. We'll not be the answer then that you remember. It would be like going back to Detroit. You know, and trying to out of the, yeah, exactly. Seriously, trying to relive the Motown days in Detroit. It just ain't the same anymore, believe me. I've got a fan foot or Harlem or something. Huh? I've got a fan foot or Harlem down this 15 minutes train ride from Amsterdam. Have you ever been to Cologne, Germany? No, Frankfort. Now, forget about Frankfort. Two and a half hour train trip from Amsterdam from Central Station. In Cologne, Germany, I promise you it'll be one of the biggest surprises of your life. A good one. All right. Okay. It's on my way. I'm cheering. Have a good time, pal. Bye now. Danke schön. And I'll still believe. And put scenes. No, I'm serious. I'm not the kid you man. And today, if that's on you right, 10th rate for this summer. Put it off a year. Okay. And I don't know. We'll have to get spy reports, I guess. Because I'm not going to go back and test the waters. You know what I mean? Well, I'm not going to take close those coffee. Coffee, coffee, champs or prevent. No, no, but that's just the way of everything is going to see the French or ones who are like, because now they remember the EU, Netherlands, they're in that EU. Yeah. And that's what they're saying. EU, maybe that was a mistake we should have done that. Because they're trying to like their clamp down a little bit on the permissive ways in the Netherlands. Oh, Jesus Christ. What? It's just like what? It's just like what the US is doing to Canada with the MR1 laws and everything else. Trying to like stick their nose into our business. Another one of those facts is about what about the president's resume. Another six pages coming across the office. Oh, what's not sending us that bush business. Okay. It's not funny. We've seen it a million times. And it wasn't funny the first time. Okay. Jesus Joseph and Saul. Let me forget that Paul Cragman piece. Don't forget that Paul Cragman piece. This hour. Here's a call from Davy. Hello. Oh, Neil? Yes, sir. How are you today? Great. Did you see on the BBC? They have a special commission coming out against players' government to find out who was lying about the weapons of mass destruction. Right. And did you see, Dawden McCain on TV this week talking about? Yeah, they were on TV and they were talking about how they want to have a bipartisan commission to find out who was exaggerating the weapons of mass destruction. Now, my question is, do you think all those little lying born again? And those are going to go against W and try to get him and teach when they figure out he was lying? No. No. Absolutely not. You think they're going to be indigand about anything that he's done? No lying about taking us to war and killing a whole bunch of people and having a whole bunch of our people killed for no reason at all except greed. That's not bad. But if it's blow jobs, then it's really bad. We know that. And even a lot, I think, sir, you know, I hate black people centered a lot. You know, the one talking about he even he is in this thing now where he wants to find out who was lying and who's exaggerating. And I said, have him come up. Something must be up. Yeah, there you go. So I said, there's a big sting coming like that article. I read little that credibility gap article there. There's a big sting coming. You only seem to be getting other. Well, you know, in addition, let me ask you this, you know, that big commission that Kissinger was supposed to be on and the bridge. Yeah, they were investigating the pre 9 11. What more did we ever hear about that? I've heard everything now. I get about it. That's deep. I mean, they put that's like putting the fox in the chicken hands. Right. But my point being, I mean, they put a couple of flunkies and charged there. And they've still have no information about that. They'll have it said to the truth. Well, I hope they get to the bottom and make W off to be the liar that he really is. Because all that exaggeration just so he could go over and kick his dad's enemy there. That was ridiculous. Yeah, I don't forget about his friends at Bechtel and all the other hell of burden to you. Yeah, what a bunch of thieves, you know, and they're good like to watch, pal. All right. Thank you, Neil. I think their day is coming. I hope so because his poles are down to 32% among the Democrats right now. And they were on TV Monday. And the people were mean. The one woman said he's a dangerous little man. And we have to get back. Yeah, he's a good guy. He was dangerous. And the pole said, who do you want is your candidate? And 62% of them said, we'll care that's registered Democrats as long as it can be Bush. We don't care what they think about the issues. Now isn't that a hell of a note? There is. It's called ABB, anyone but Bush. I know, right? Okay. You've got a vote early in off and man. Yeah. 560, 750, 550, pound 560 on the AT&T line. You know, you watch him. He's over there. He's been prancing around in Europe. And now he's going over there in the Middle East. And you watch him speak. And you say, you really ask yourself, can this man really be the president of this country? Is it possible that there are people anywhere who really take him seriously? I got ahead. This is John Cretchen, our prime minister here in Canada. Even though he's a silly frog. I got to say this. He continues taking every opportunity he can to tell it like it is. About the outrageous deficits that this administration's built up about the fact that this guy's a bozo. I mean, even though they were over there, like, you know, patting each other on a shoulder and smiling face to face, Cretchen made it very clear right from the beginning that this man's a dumbo. You just want, I mean, we had Gerald Ford, but keep in mind, nobody elected him. He got him when Nixon quit. And even that peanut farmer Carter beat him in 76. So nobody elected Gerald Ford president. Dumboard and saw us. But this guy, I mean, at least Reagan, for all of his dangerous, and he sure was dangerous. He was the first pawn of the right wing to ever win the White House. But he was a movie actor. He was slick. Right. Even the shoe polish was slick. He looked good up there. But this guy's about as slick as the cobblestone streets in Amsterdam, but he had read light district there. Oops. Don't fall down. I'm big and I've got to know, let's don't do it, man. Don't do it because you'll be so depressed and so sad. You'll say, what happened to this place? And I think it was a very good analogy to compare it to Detroit. Detroit used to be an exciting, a great city. I mean, just, ah, fabulous place. The Motown era, the early 60s, the mid 60s. And then something happened in 67. I think it was called a bunch of fires. 1214 at 560 WQM, how low can they go? We're asking today and we're talking about interest rates.

On inside of behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story, she was an outspoken Irish girl with no hair. She was shenned or conner. Now to come back... That's what I come to. Come to me, dear! What a one for me! I'm fucking bald! I changed my fucking head! What does that tell ya? Some lived on the correlation between Shenado counter short lived career and their talent for pissing off everybody on the freaking planet. Don't get me started! Shenade's one-time manager, Sleppy Gold. I remember when she tore off the picture of the Pope on Saturday night live. I begged the Shenade on anything but the Pope! I gave her a stack of eight-by-tenths to choose from. Richard Nixon, Gandhi, Christy McNickle, anything. But no, it's got to be the Pope. Of course I asked her why she's being so difficult. She tells me... I'm fucking bald! I got no hair! You're deaf! Pile, shite! Don't fucking with me! Realizing that Shenade had her only hit with a song written by Prince. We asked the purple rain star about his experience with the fire-reoconer. So, if I may, Prince... Oh, Jesus, sorry. The artist formerly known as Prince... Mm-hmm. What was your memory of Shenade O'Connor? Look, she's f***ed bald! She's she the f***ed head! Now, what does it tell you? Shenado counter. She was the Susan Powder of Rock Music. Hey, give us a break. How many bald chicks can you come up with on the top of your head? It's a big juicy shopping wed look at show business. Tonight, on inside the mind. You all believe this, but it's because I've never heard that before. I just played it off the new disc. And when he got to the part of how she shaved her head bald... And immediately, Shenade O'Connor popped into my mind. And with it like, three seconds, he said it. How do you like that? Oh, yeah. Shocking, amazing! Twenty-passed noon at five, 60, WDQA. I have another feeling. I have a sucking prediction that for well and more. I'm going to be the toughest troops for days and weeks and months to come. What do you think of that? Oh, right. I think it's going to be really hairy. Here's a call from Miami, hello. Miami? Hello, dear. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. How's your butt that asshole, Riley? I mean, that argument about lying about getting that P-body ward? No. Yeah, a big blow out of the book. Some of you have a hand and another right ass, a right ass, a right ass, a right ass, a car. He lied to my gay people, I'd keep out of the ward and then he's delighted. I mean, that a big thing about him and knew yesterday. I think what it was is he played Mr. Peabody to divorce and a bowling call. Wasn't that it? Did you have a P-body? Maybe he wants to have made a pit stop in P-body mass. He ever been to P-body? No. No, forget about it. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon. I'm sure glad that this last call or we had his faculty not there for us. That other right wing, Kami, pinko. Let's come back. Somebody will know. Here's a call from Kendall. Hey, honey. Okay. I want to see what your opinion was on Howard Dean. The Vermont governor. He's been pretty good. So far, I don't know that much about him. I read some of his comments. I think he's pretty good. He's got some balls. I agree with a lot of his, he's a, I believe he had an opinion. He's not afraid to express that he's not afraid of Bush. He's not afraid to bash the crap bottom. Dennis Cassinuches making some nice noise. Two, even though the media is ignoring him. He's saying a lot of the right things. And Senator Bobby, he could be the Dark Horse Senator. He's been good. Evan's no bad calls Howard Dean at dangerous Dark Horse. Good. Good. Good. Keep in mind. Keep in mind that before 76 nobody ever heard a Jimmy Carter before 92. Nobody ever heard of Bill Clinton. So a lot of these guys, it's only in the last one. He gets to the primaries that these guys emerge. And I have a feeling that we're going to have a much larger voter turn out this year. Cause crazy. And that always favors the new. Uh, can't it not the incumbent. Right. So I think I mean, my opinion is Bush can't win. I know so many people. Let's throw a briefs of guys. Yeah. Feed him. Also everyone, at least I know someone who works in the upper echelons of IBM international business machine. They all don't like, I don't know why, but they don't like them. I don't know. I don't know why, but they don't like them. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe he'll win, but I just don't see it being. He doesn't know. He doesn't know how many million phony votes I guess they can come up with next time. Yeah. And how many hundreds of millions he can put in. He can promote himself with. No shortage of that man. Yeah. All right. Thanks. He likes watch pal. How are deans okay in my book? I mean he's very enjonding. Or Jimmy Dean and dizzy Dean and deafy Dean. Here's a fact that says. Oh. It's the opposite of the truth. And it's from the guy with the eyes. Oh, the guy with the eyes. Oh, no. Now I know who's handwriting that is on the thine. No one deals on vacation. You're hard up to put on entertaining shows. But George is the worst. Demister read. This is written like a retard wrote it. So you know why? Probably is the guy with the eyes. Hey, Greg. Good. Oh, chuckle. You're going to chuckle. Oh, he chumming. Yeah. And we put it up on the website. And he thanked us profusely. You know, this can't be the guy with the eyes. And he just says, I don't know. So he said, You know, And he said, Oh, What is he thinking? What is he thinking? He said, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, The guy with the eyes. Here you're on the embrace so OK. In fact, The probably Gilbert left him for another guy. Okay. So when I'm thinking probably left him for the guy with the funny pack, and that's why he's gotten too much time on his hand. You're a simple King. Okay. Get a freaking life. All these years. I mean, the years just go smokin' by almost 30 years in his market, and the same tired, misfits, the same sad like whistling, the same no lives continued Darkeningard door in our goddamn radio speakers. Jesus Christ. And then the best part of him is he'll come to your appearances and just suck your ass, you know, to your face, right? Anyone who will tolerate it. Do you, George? Or did you know you're going to think for free? Do you know? We don't want to see you. We don't want to know from you. Just like the time he came up, showed up at Highly with his other boyfriend there. That little, Chubby Miss Fit. Oh, what you did it a bird was unconshital. What you did to the bird? And give me a lamb sitting there, try to, you know, watch the races and enjoy myself. And he comes out there to the track expecting me to put on a talk show for him. You need mental health, man. You need serious health. In fact, that's one of those polls we should take in where we talked about who should live and who should have died. The tree lady, his mother, she should still be alive and he ought to be pushing up daisies. The guy with the I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I. Jack and he might have lost the parents as he still lives with dad and doesn't work. Doesn't work, huh? Go get a job, you quizzing, you loser, you will lung head, anyway, 254 votes are last movie full today to we change our minds. It won't be for a while, till, but Thursday, right? Which of these movies did you like the most? Didn't see any of May 2, Glenn Gering, Glenn Ross 36? Huh? That's pretty good. They all suck 34, really improve for a dream, which wasn't first place. 31. The game 20, movement of a momento 19, Gatica 14, Magnolia 13, happiness only 5 and shall agree for. I'm surprised happiness isn't real better. Maybe because it's too morbid for them, maybe because there's too much about pedophilia, maybe you saw it because it got sold out. What do you mean by that? Oh, no, we can get a copy of it. You've seen it. Mm-hmm. And I'm going to scale the five stars, you'll give it four and a half. Right, exactly exactly what I had in mind. Boner boy, you see it? Happiness? No, I'll bring in my copy. Yes. I'm going to buy that other one. Which I had in order. Yeah, by Magnolia, and he can he can watch it too because he's on a very, very restricted budget. The next couple of points. 27 pass no and when you drive by that I 95 over pass right there by where the a big go oak tree is. Just throw a few shackles out there for Boner boy.

Nice time I went to the movies just to see the original Rocky. See Laura, I know this may come as a shock to you, sweet heart, since you're a little bit behind the time. But they had these amazing things called video tapes and DVDs. Can almost every movie that has ever been made is now available in some some store. On video tape and or DVD, that's what stimulated this whole series of conversations was I discovered by DVD player was really a great thing and I stare watching all these movies. And I don't want you to know to have to buy and even go and rent them. In fact, Joe was telling me that Janina is wife. What the hell's the name of the thing on the internet? Next day movies are something like that. I service. Oh, I can't remember the website. Anyway, it's a service where they send you a movie and then you watch it and you send it back and they send you another one. That every day you. What is it? Netflix Netflix Netflix dot com. And I don't know how much it cost, but obviously you're not buying a bunch of movies and you're just getting them for one day and you watch it. And you send it back and keep it in different one every day or however often you want to get. See that's the way it works Laura that that's why that's why this whole thing developed now because it's a whole. I mean, I agree with her that back in the olden days when you start talking about movies when most people never saw what what's the point. You know, but here what we're trying to do is we're trying to like stimulate you to go out and rent it or buy it and watch it because we think it's going to be very entertaining and you might actually enjoy it. I know that's probably illegal in South Florida, but just keep your go or close real tight. Keep it or locked. At least better than Matt Dylan didn't at the dumpy was living in. See if you could get that door shut a little bit tighter. I haven't better off and get the hats off the bed. Don't let David in. Oh, too late.

If he's just the one who will or his camping up his himself. Like that. Or get about it. Is what I would say. That's what he told a Johnny Dept. Forget about it. 1235. Here's the Paul Cragman article. Thanks for reminding me. Standard operating procedure from yesterday's New York Times. Don't forget. Sure. Okay. The mystery of her wax missing weapons of match destruction has become a lot less mysterious. Recent reports in major British newspapers and three major American news magazines based on leaks from angry intelligence officials back up the sources who told my colleague Nick Christoff at the Bush administration grossly manipulated intelligence about WMDs. And anyone who talks about an intelligence figure is missing the point. The problem lay not with intelligence professionals but with the Bush and blurred administrations they wanted a war so they demanded reports supporting their case while dismissing contrary evidence. Kind of sounds like the awarding commissioner report. In Britain the news media have not been shy about drawing the obvious implications in the outrage has not been limited to war puns. The times of London was ardently pro-war nonetheless agran in an analysis under the headline, lie another day. The paper drew parallels between the selling of the war and another omnislighting claims. The government has seen his having spun the threat from Sodom's weapon just as it spins everything else. If you have made the same argument in this country even though spin is far too mild award for what the Bush administration does all the time. Suggestions that the public was manipulated in a supporting and Iraq war gained credibility from the fact that misrepresentation and deception are stated operating procedure for this administration which to an extent never be foreseen in US history systematically and reasonly distorts the facts. Am I exaggerating? Even as George Bush done report is by declaring that we have found the weapons of mass destruction, the Republican National Committee declared that the latest tax code benefits everyone who pays taxes. This is simply a lie. You've heard about those eight million children in the night any tax break by last minute switcheroo in total 50 million American households including a majority of those with members over 65 get nothing. Another 20 million received less than $100 a piece and a great majority of those left behind do pay taxes. And the Paul Faced misrepresentation of an a latest tax code offering little or nothing the most Americans is only the latest at the long string of blatant misstatements. Misleading the public has been a consistent strategy for the Bush team, unleashes ranging from tax policy and social security reform to energy in the environment. So why should we give the administration a benefit of the doubt on foreign policy? It's long past time for this administration to be held accountable over the last two years we've been going to co-acustom this pattern. Each time the administration comes up with another waper, partisan supporters are group that includes a large segment of the news media, obediently insist that black is white and up is down. Meanwhile the quote unquote liberal media report only that some people say that black is black and up is up. And some democratic politicians offer the administration and valuable cover by making excuses and playing down the extended lies. If the same lack of accountability extends to matters of war and peace were in very deep trouble, the British seem to understand this. Max Hastings, the veteran Warren Corr, a correspondent who supported Britain's participation in the war, writes that the Prime Minister committed British troops and sacrificed British lives on the basis of the seat and its stinks. It's no answer to say, Sautam was a murderous tyrant. I can point out that many of the neo-conservatives who foamated this war were non-challot or worse about mass murders by central American death squads in the 80s. But the important point is that this isn't about Saddam. It's about us. The public was told that Saddam poath an imminent threat. If that claim was fraudulent, the selling of the war is arguably the worst scandal in American political history, worse than Watergate, worse than Iran, contra, and the idea that we were deceived into war makes many commentators so uncomfortable that they refuse to admit even the possibility. But here's the thought that we should make those commentators really uncomfortable. Suppose the disemministration did connisten to war and suppose that it is not held accountable for its deception, so Mr. Bush can fight what Mr. Hastings calls a tacky election next year. In that case our political system has become utterly and perhaps irrevocably corrupted. You say irrevocably or irrevocably. irrevocably. How about forever? Permanent or momento. Permanent. Good article is usual. Paul Cretman yesterday's New York Times Standard Appering procedure. Don't forget to read that article by Paul Cretman. Okay. Twenty-two-one at five-sixth year.

You just facts me. From the Guardian. This should be on our website by the way, Boner Boy. Okay. From today's Guardian, the written newspaper Wolfowitz says Iraq War was about oil. This is the same asshole who just said last week that the weapons of mass destruction thing was just an excuse. We just used that as a, you know, a means to go in. Oil was the main reason for military action against Iraq leading White House Hawk has claimed confirming the worst fears of those opposed to the US-led war. The US deputy of Fencec could trade Paul Wolfowitz was already under my Tony Blair's position over weapons of mass destruction by describing them as a bureaucratic excuse for war, which I just said has now gone further by claiming the real motive was that Iraq is swimming in oil. Ah, sounds like something I said many, many months ago. Want it? Oh, I, L, and M, O, any, why? The latest comments were made by Mr. Wolfowitz and addressed to delegates had an Asian security government in Singapore over the weekend, and reported today by German newspapers their target, speagle, and developed. Asked why nuclear power such as North Korea was being treated differently from Iraq, where hardly any weapons of mass destruction had been found, the deputy defense minister said, let's look at it simply. The most important difference between North Korea and Iraq is that economically, we just had no choice in Iraq, the country swims in a sea of oil. Mr. Wolfowitz went on to tell journalists that the conference at the US was set on a path negotiation to help the few tensions between North Korean and its neighbors and contrast to the more belligerent added to the Bush administration displayed in its dealings with Iraq. His latest comments follow his widely reported statement from an interview in Vanity Fair last month, in which he said that for reasons that have a lot to do with the US government bureaucracy, we settled on the one issue that everybody could agree on weapons of mass destruction. Prior to that, his boss, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, had already undermined the British government position by saying, Sonom Hussein may have destroyed his van weapons before the war. Mr. Wolfowitz's frank assessments of the importance of oil couldn't come at a worse time for the US and UK governments, which are both facing fierce criticism and whole in a broad of allegations that they exaggerated the threat posted by Saddam Hussein ordered justify the war. Amid growing calls from all parties for a public inquiry to foreign affairs select committee, an onslaught set of investigations that the UK government misled the country, over 7th of Iraq's WMD, the move is a major setback for Tony Blair, it hoped to contain any inquiry within the intelligence and security committee which meets in secret and reports to the Prime Minister direct. Let's see if this works. I think it's going to work. I don't know. There's UNO's even on that remote. It was like a little glitch. It was a glitch. The war has a glitch. The war has a glitch.

I read in two votes on a poll, our last movie poll for the foreseeable future, in other words, between now and two o'clock. Which one of these movies did you like the most? And I'll see the fact that the leading category didn't see any of 92. That's a positive thing. Which I think? Because that means that we still have 30.4% of the audience. Well, it's a lot more than that, because we may have people that saw one of these or a couple, but a lot of them they haven't seen yet. Right. So they're in for a treat. Right. And now that doesn't mean necessarily you're going to agree with us. And like all of these, but I have a feeling unless your taste is in your touches the US liven used to say that you're going to find some interesting crap here. Some enjoyment if you laugh a few depressing psychotic moments. Few a drug-induced episodes. Didn't see any of 92. Glenn Gary Glenn Ross 44. Requiem for Dream 39.

If you missed the beginning of the show, I watched Magnolia last night. And we've gotten, you know, a little smattering here in there. Very, you know, minimal. I, for me, I mean, maybe you like vanilla ice cream. Maybe you like butter pecan to me. It's bland boring, you know. I like a rocky road. I like fish food. I like, uh, briars, uh, score ice cream. Oh, why am I saying this? I'm on the mood for it today. That's good. Do you know what's really great? I could at least it's working for me. And I have been eating quite a bit of crap like any early afternoon after the show ends. Because that's, but when I had that bacon, you know, a little order of bacon in the morning before the show. Which I make it in microwave. Uh, it seems to like help my blood sugar tremendously. And they always say if you eat breakfast, if you like balance your food after we make it right.

Hello, this is Professor Nogolfo, VJ Singh. I'm the one who cried like a small child when I heard that Anacastorn's there, I was going to plan the previous tour. So, how she did? I did not watch it. I'm kidding, I did. That's a good right? I saw her cry afterwards. This is why I was against this. There was no planning in golf. So, my ring's fitting and going driving, yes, but no planning. Drinking, cheating, causing and some homosexual well-playing, yes, but no planning and a PGA tour. Bad wedding, most picking and written DBB had been, yes, but no planning. Oh, I see Anacastorn sent me something in there of the weekend. Let me read this too. It says, dear but much, that's a recent, not so nice nickname given to me by a group of Aracastorn's damn fans. Dear but much, you are still happy now? Even though I play well, I feel to make the weekend, but at least I play. You ran home like a small girl who got her picked out the port. Pupa knew but much. That's it. This is only slight for her to look, to me, because I didn't sort of run from like a small girl who got picked out the port. But I will be back this week playing again because I know girl find up. Maybe I'm not for confident in my sexuality, but I have time to get the mail, to open this paper. I like a better one than the girl from play. They should play with dolls and make up and sometimes they're other than their tops with a light bulb. Now, I'll be just saying things that song. No, I don't think. That singing is for girls and they're play present from a male can idol. Today I'd like to read a letter that I'm writing to all white people today in the spirit of unity and understanding. Dear white folk, couple of things you ought to know. When I'm born, I'm black. When I grow up, I'm black. When I get sick, I'm black. When I go out in the sun, I'm black. When I go out in the cold, I'm black. When I get scared, I'm black. And when I die, I'm still black. But you, my white man, when you're born, you're pink. When you grow up, you are white. When you get sick, you are green. When you go out in the sun, you go red. And when you get cold, you turn blue. When you get scared, you turn yellow. And I have years to tell my life is when white people die. You turn purple. And you got the damn nerve to call me, call it. Oh, I like to know who won the election. Said I'd like to know who won the election. Count the vote, count the vote baby, count the vote. Count the vote over, count the vote.
