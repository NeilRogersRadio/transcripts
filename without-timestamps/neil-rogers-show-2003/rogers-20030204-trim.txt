I screwed up twice yesterday and why did And then your under orders right now. Well, first let me tell you this Yes, I forgot that we don't do the beginning of the show until 10 o'clock and So I backed box myself into a corner as opposed to last whatever was Friday, especially We did magnificently well and then you know people come in at 10 and they don't know what they were talking about So yesterday's poll you'll have to wait not that it was all that big of a deal and today's poll You'll also have to wait even find out what it is. They'll have to wait and you know the other mistake I made And you're not you're not gonna be allowed to permit it. Okay under any circumstances in fact I wanted to be some kind of a sound Food now oh It's Oh I made my comments about toast and and Seriously now they can knock anybody on the station for not talking about hockey, which is probably right because they don't know anything about it But they're doing the right thing. There is no interest. It is if you want a turning audience off in droves If you want to send them diving for the dial faster than anything else, that's the one thing in this town that'll do it I found the sound what's the sound I make a bear. I remember one that I like so much Yeah Yeah, I like it find it I'm not even in the right mode Well, that'd be funny. They have few found it So anyway we apologize profusely because when I stand that most of you don't care it's unfortunate But I can't change that okay Just the way it is down here. It's a bum fork place and they don't give a crap about things like that and you're not gonna change them You're not gonna change this place these people these people Oh Cheese so no to it again. Okay. Thank you So much that'd be funny Anyway, here's a fact to get us started this morning and all right see there's a little bit of a problem even our management admits that this hour is like It doesn't it can't doesn't work can't work ain't gonna happen We don't know how to solve that problem and they've got a team of experts of psychoanalysts that they brought in to try to figure out how we get out of this But this is this is a throwaway hour And why they're throwing me away? Be tell out of me, but I guess just punishment for being a sour old prick something like that And there are a few things in a world worse than a sour old prick believe me when I tell you but anyway You just mind your own business.

Don't say it doesn't wear a two-pay and he's not gay and he'll let all the reporters yank on it to make sure it's for real And the week two Fox news the network America tries to pay Sodom says a common dream is new center The sat phones are lined up the tensor in place dozens of languages fill the smoke field atrium Every kind of technical equipment imaginable is scattered about the scene almost resembles an area of a version of the quick setup for heavy metal concert Welcome to the press center of the ground floor of the Iraqi Ministry of Information Over the last several weeks low-paid Iraqi construction workers have rubbed elbows with journalists from CNN BBC New York Times and a slew of other media outlets the workers are halfway through a sizable construction project to expand the press center To accommodate the influx of proverbial herds waiting for the war Inside the building tiny six by six cubicles are now the hottest real estate on the Baghdad market Officially the space will cost you 500 bucks a month, but spaces limited and cash is flowing from the pockets of the major networks to Iraqi officials and the government to ensure What access once the bomb star flying? But this is not just the cubicles under the government guidelines journalists cough up a handsome some of money the government Individual officials here are the bare minimums for journalists operating in Baghdad $100 a day feet per journalist camera per technical staff, etc $150 a day per permission used a satellite telephone which the journalist tanker provide themselves 50 to 100 bucks a day for mandatory government escort $50 to $100 a day for car and driver some network several fleet of vehicles and 75 bucks a day for room at the al-Rashid hotel That's already 500 bucks and doesn't include the thousands of dollars daily for reach direct live satellite feed for TV networks Nor does it include the bribes and tips shell out left and right Nor does include the money handed over at border crossings in a tear port the networks don't like to talk about how much they actually spend But one veteran of the media scene he estimated to cost for major TV network at about a hundred thousand dollars a month Others say that's a low estimate almost all of this cash except a few tips here in there goes directly to the Iraqi government Once you add up the bill for the TV network so long we're talking perhaps millions of dollars in revenue a month for the government There's a joke here that the major media outlets are now competing with oil smuggling as the number one money maker for the Iraqi government It is particularly ironic that while Rupert Murdoch's troops from Fox News network rally for the war dismissing antiwar activists as dups of the Iraqi regime the network America trust is paying Sodom as they refer to Iraq hand over fist tens of thousands of dollars every month But stroll down the halls of the press and you'll see that Rupert's troops have multiple battalions He also owns Sky News the British version of Fox as well as the times of London a Vitor research will probably find that Murdoch owns other publications operating here as well Fox News reporter reporters know this as well like to say for the benefit of the viewers that their broadcast are being modern to buy the Iraqi government Fair enough, but perhaps the Murdoch Empire should begin each of its reports or dispatches from Baghdad But it's closing how much money they paid Sodom today How do you like that, huh?

I was I was driving into the parking lot this morning and I heard them hernetically trying to drum up something to talk about because now that football season is over There's nothing people want to hear about they want to hear about basketball? Of course not they want to hear about Okay, come on, oh, oh, oh, oh, no So one of these guys been talk about okay until we came to work on this radio station I never in my life realized before that there even was such a thing is the animal that infests this place Maybe now would be a good time for them to look at it squeeze it analyze it and think Why is it that we're so married to this nonstop ramen clock? Especially since the best day part of this station Traditionally for the past five years and not traditionally, but always has been this non sports day part Huh, but we don't have any recluse about talk How about your part that's considered crazy talking what these wall something let's had some crazy talk you'd a better share than a two seven I guarantee you that In a way I feel for those guys at least some of them what are you gonna talk about now? This is a one one trick pony here this town and they don't know much about that either, but that's all they care about Well, if you have you how is they recruiting for the herk who and football coming for next year? I heard that I wanted to turn around to go back home. I Hey, I all the sudden got to some believable two-thake my whole mouth was like move like that swollen My roiids were like inflamed From here in that kind of crap I mean, I never realized that there were such people which reminds me don't let me forget about that other pull I think we'll do it tomorrow in fact me believe in do it today because this ain't gonna go over I don't think I'll let know we got a bunch of votes you're leading of course so we'll leave it on there But at any rate no, it's seriously that remember the guy facts the poll last week about That what age did you stop worrying? We're not talking about attending sporting events. That's one thing. We're talking about like in every day garb walking around in sports jerseys and stuff Sports perforated like in your regular life I thought that was good, you don't like that pull What the you know about a good pull? I know my pull has to believe me I've been scouring the world looking for The parade of popular belief nothing oh yeah, oh, I see now is getting nervous has getting real You would you like us to announce a press conference so that you've been announced the word that you're not gay?

It's nice to share don't cherry Thank you sorry if sorry I said that Sound a little bit like sorry grapes We all in a Palazzo this audience you can't force feed it to a much understand you can't force feed them They don't care about certain things and This station is maniacal thing where we got rape Perry running right about I had a nightmare about him last night about rape Perry You lie no I really I had a nightmare about rape Perry was he the dinosaur? I don't remember what that was but he was like making life miserable for everybody including me And I was like throwing things at the wall and just getting all bent out of shape about him Here's one of the most innocuous guys that ever came down to pike was trying to Fly below the radar here as much as possible so they can continue you know Getting a check and like get to his retirement and get that a lot of here and say bye bye. I you know good plan Yeah, good thinking Ray cuz I'm here and but anyway And I had a nightmare about him To show you how this was affects your mind. I don't recall the tales I'm one of those people when I wake up in the morning.

Let's get a call or two about it You think we're gonna call no, no, and you want it? Why cuz the sports nerds who are glued to this radio station I'm a clock they're all after they got their hurricane outfits and they're dolphin jerseys and their jets are paraphernal I mean if you go to a sporting event you were in that domain heat difference of your hundred that's fine I close with the ambiance of the territory But when you're like going out for supper or something like that when you go in for a breakfast and denies for the grand slam Or whatever you're getting over there grand slam make another strong sport check as he's ready Region for you know you know, I'm maybe when you go into denies you should be where and I take that back Although not an adult not an adult walking around and stuff. I'm like I mean that did I should go in the denies It doesn't matter. Yeah, does I know I see people like that. I think you overgrown guy like 35 40 years old He's walking around he's got his dolphin thing. I like a child. I think I could be a child just by being in denies You don't have the right to criticize anybody's a peril. That's a good point Of course, you know me. I wear the same clothes every day anyway, so what am I who mind to talk? Although that's a Relatively newest shirt. Is it huh? Relatively long some of my chief sandwich on there so no look to close it's 10 27 at five Five 60 to a QAM how's that pull coming? Which of these people we got 63 votes in there?

Maybe a little man. I hate them fake southern accent. Like some of the colors we get in a funny draw. She does make horrible. Makes me want to stick my finger.

John Revolted Justin Tinkerbell. Mike Piazza Richard you went on a writer all of those so far got to big for a long way to go. You know what what you put your name on that list of the child would be you. But it doesn't fit on my mind. No, it doesn't fit on the lake in a per. But when that's because a lot of people out there dislike you now quite frankly from where I sit that's not a knock. Okay, who the hell gives a crap? I don't but they perceive it as a way to to just to just to claw. They're clawing through the radio and the fax machine and they've phone. They want to get it. You don't you don't like you. I understand just don't like you. Okay. Well, I haven't seen him yet. 10 57 at five 60 though. I guarantee that there are people out there in this audience who dislike you like crazy that I would be real. I'd be anxious to be tummy with. Huh? What do you live in a vibe? I wouldn't let that stand in a way. We'll shrimp like you. I just kick you off to the side. Anyway, it's the 25th anniversary of Brandy Shoes in Palmano Beach. It's a miracle. They've been in town almost as long as I have. Any independent family shoe store that last nearly a quarter of a century especially in this town is got to be doing a lot of things right. Like offering a fantastic unbeatable select to men's and women's famous brand shoes like rock ports. You know what's really killing me is those dance cigars. How come you letting me smoke those? Keep me blind them up too. By the way, clearance fire me right now. Rock ports echo is Mufisto Timberland Clark's essayist floor shaman lots more. Then there's the unbelievable range of sizes at Brandy's. They got them all men's sizes. Size is 1615 women's five to 12 and which from the very narrow to the very wide. If you got a big fat one and a big fat foot two, they can help you out. And don't forget their professional sales staff that knew your feet inside and out. So they give you real service all the time with over 40,000 parents stock in their 8,000 square foot mega store. You'll virtually never hear, sorry, Mr. We don't have your size in that shoe. Sorry, Mr. I missed those people. You know what the homeless crowd up there in Toronto? Sorry, Mr. Or no, that's what I say to them. How does that work? So when you need shoes get into Brandy shoes, there's always a sale of special sales promotion. Brandy is a great great place. They're unbeatable to shop for shoes. You'll find them at 12 90 North Edible Highway in Papua, Vito, over in daily 9 to 9. Sunday's 10 to 5 and all this wicked Brandy shoes take 10 bucks off on any shoes price to over $50. The offer is good on every famous brand in the store with the Xift MS A shoes. Now is that the right tag? Uh huh. Well, no, I don't think it is because somebody gave me this other one that says, Uh, oh, Thursday, per voice, like I said, but I just said it's true at Brandy's this way. I'm not gonna say it in the world. We're supposed to be in 5, 6, oh, you way, yeah. People are ice holes. Over the past few months, I noticed I was losing some hair. So I talked to my doctor and he told me about Rogan. I asked him about propicia, but he told me since I'm on the antidepressant pack sale. Procicia might not be a good idea, and patso causes some sexual dysfunction. So I take my aggra to counter antidepressant. But that causes me to feel nauseated, which is why I used this ant acid, which works well for that, but it doesn't work for long enough periods for my heartburner acid reflux. So my doctor told me about Primalseq, which keeps me awake. So he gave me zanics, which I started taking too much of, and that kind of worried, and so he weed me off that and put me on Trasito, which is not really a sleeping medication, but it works like one anyway, and it's not addictive. It also causes headaches, which is why I take my eyes. By eyes, works differently than any other antideflammatory, and lasts up to 24 hours, and that can be a huge pain when it hurts your stomach like it does mine. Not nauseous, just sharp stabbing pain. I'd recode on fix that, but boy does that make me nauseous. So now I reach for new maithlux. Maithlux is scientifically designed to stop nausea instantly. New maithlux, ask your doctor. Okay, it's level 0 to 560wQ. How can we be leaving off? I'm playing the Ricky Martin bit, and we never put him on there. Carlos, well we're really, we apologize for being, I'm a sleep, I gotta go to excuse, I'm an acoma. I'm an acoma, Derek. Okay. I'm just, I have no energy left. I just cannot continue holding these people's hands. I love going to the track once maybe twice a week, but I just can't continue this if it's like an incessant thing. I see Derek is one of those people, my friend Derek who's a good guy, but if there's a race going on anywhere north America anywhere in the world, that's that you can bet on. He'll be there, like till 2, 3, 4 and a morning, whatever. See what I'm saying? And I finally just run out of steam, I get home by midnight 12, 30. I get maybe 4 hours asleep and I come dragging my ass in here and I'm thinking, I like that. Like today, pretty sorry, a state of affairs, and plus of course he provides me with these great little cigars, which are just killing me. He's killing me with kindness, him and the rest of the fat man. I'll talk to the rest. No you won't. I'm smoking him on a way to mommy's house. In fact, I might smoke some in her house during lunch just to piss her off. And Rika Iglesias, somebody says, wow, the house wrong with that. Huh? And Rika. Got it? Good. He's up with us now because they may start chasing George real fast. I hope one of them catches him. Now to show you how it is. Here's a bad mistake on here. And you people out there get one that hears a mistake. Lance Bass, the do-eyeed fact from the back street boys. Lance Fag is with instinct, okay? Get with it. What do you would you like? It's not the same, whatever. It may be the same genre as you would say. And the back street boys, at least in the studio, they could make them sound like they can sing, which they really can't. But nevertheless instinct can one make any difference. What you do to them? If you put a gun up there, as they still couldn't sing, but they might enjoy it. Lance Bass, get his ass on there. Get his ass, Lance Bass. Scott Wolf. Now, now I'm starting to get upset. It's as Scott Wolf the Wussy from TV in the movies. He was in Party of Five, inches. You know who Scott Wolf is? He's a real pretty. Well, in that case. You know Scott Wolf? You know who that is? Well, get it on there anyway, Schmuck. You know who Party of Five? Don't you remember I read the story many, many months ago, about how he was in some movie. And they had a gazing with him, so the guy. And they had a tough, they got so emotional and worked up in a day like head time. It was like having to get two fighters apart in a boxing. It's similar to how he plays in a fight. Kevin Spacy, the actor for Ag. Well, I mean, is that in doubt? Is he getting a route? In a route this week. I don't know. Put him on or Kevin Spacy. We're sick compared to him. It says these guys are so gay my answer. It says JK from Hollywood. Well, how do you like that? Back to him. Obviously, he's not moving fast enough. What about Richard Jermel gear? Did we finally put Dick gear on there? I hope. Ah, yes, we did. I don't see it. Oh, there it is. He finally got a boat. Well, some of these are on there a little bit late. Late editions. But once you already in season on there, what about some local people here? How about Bill Kamal? The weather lady at Channel 7. What about her? Him? What are people who? Guess. Do Ilaughter now? Do I? Do I? Based on what I got based on your tales about him eating ass? That's you. I can take him. Mohara, David, I don't think he's gay. No, it's serious. That's homophobic as they come. Joe Rose? Ken Dorsey? Tom Brady, you wish. This is just a list of it. It's a ridiculous list. Let's see. Oh, Janet Reno. Yes, we are leaving out Michael Jackson because he's in the category of pedophiles, which they don't want to let him choose all of that again. Even though their Catholic church loves doing that. Janet Reno. How could we leave butch Janet out? Here's some people I believe Alex says. Missy, Mr. Meer, Elliot. Okay. What's that? Who's that? She seems kind of ducky. Who's that? She's a rap artist. Is big right now? Not bad either. Well, excuse me for not knowing what your name is. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. Missy, Mr. Meer, Elliot? Mike Myers. She had never really thought about that. Funny guy. He's Canadian, eh? Well, how can he not be that? Funny Canadians? So what do we say about that? I guess somebody will hold form horrors and Alex will ever send me to list. Sinbad. Bad haircut. I think of the son. I'm taking a what's his name. Who am I thinking of? With a really nasty. Well, whatever. The rainy beigees. Oh, come on. Don't be picking on the beigees. Now after Morris died, it's bad. Oh, cordel stored. You got to put her on there. Cordel stored. He's another one holds a press conference every week. Oh, no, no, no, I'm not. Brian or cross. The original weather fairy. There's only one. There we go. Dr. Woldesonner. Oh, rich factor. I'll get his facts. sarcastic. Bastard. That he is. Here's another vote for a rookie Martin and Cordel Stewart. Ever seen the two of them alone? Who? In the showers? John for Volta. Boca Brian. Boca Brian. Oh, my god. Rich, pack the seas. He's just taking shots. He's season the opportunity of this poll to take nasty shots. Did people? Why does he have a bug? He doesn't have a bug. Oh, I know it's from that CD. When there's something to spute over the cover on the CD or the line or something. Huh? I don't know. And Paul Harvey Jr. He's gone there. Paul Harvey Jr. There's a lot of things. He's an orange head, but he most definitely is not. Okay. Rich, pack the. Do you think we can get a show on after Bill O'Walley on Fox called the pack your factor? I think of the, I'm very hit. Kind of tilt there a political valence a little bit just a little bit back to the left. Anyway. Oh, yes. Somebody facks his me, Jim, the feedies call him here. If things get really slow, which they already have, we might read that. Jim, the feedy. Snatching the feet from the jaws of victory once again. Boy, Jim, you really, Maria, sourposed. Basically what he's saying is, well, it's really a sad sitting here in the office. Is the hero known as used to be a great newspaper. And now we suck. Well, I guess why do everybody else knows the two Jim? Maybe we'll get to that. If things get really, really, really desperate needs next couple of hours. Don't forget join QM and Marlins players. We don't, we're not mentioning which ones. They probably don't want us to say that they have any players left that we know who they are. Join them for Marlins, Caravay, nooned to do today at Hooters and Las Olas. The first 10 people to go ahead and mention they heard about the Caravay on QM. Get a $20, who just gives you to pick it. And it's a perfect opening day. They also get to rub, but me, go on ahead. To pet his mojo. 560, 5060 on the head, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Marlins line. Like Marlins, you just want to know those people you don't think of in any. You see what I'm saying? In fact, I have doubts that he has a penis. Very funny guy. We like Mike Myers a lot on his show, but I really doubt that he hasn't organ. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Yeah, tomorrow morning this is Smallville Post, and the Port Loro Del Paper. There's a one? Smallville Post, sir. Oh yeah, that's right tomorrow is a big day and tonight's Tuesday. I'm so asleep. I'm forgetting all these things. That's okay. I didn't want to mention the star that in your list. I don't think you'd want to put him in there. But you think he's gay? No, not at all. I don't either. No. There's something I want to comment on yesterday. You mentioned about the 50 cars following the mail truck. Yeah. You know, it's a color mention that. Right. It's amazing because you look like a Columbine. And how long it took for them to go inside the building. They had the whole basic militia there. And they were scared of two students. And they, you know, because they're stupid fear. But here, you know, they had 50 cars. And, you know, it just, it's ridiculous. Yeah, for one mail truck that they had already shot the taris on. Right. As opposed to Columbine. I mean, there was a science teacher that was shot. And he died because it took them so long to get in the building. I mean, you know, they had 100 officers. They could have won him with their gear. And I mean, they knew there were two students. I mean, it's a filling consistent. Yeah. They want to make a big show of force. But then they're afraid to go in. Crapied job. Let's face it. Yeah. Well, thanks, Neil. Have a great day. See you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. How could we have forgotten?

Here's Miami. Hello Oh, yes, sir Um, first I'd like to say that I absolutely think George is definitely gay Yeah, I'm I'm starting to think so after that red face Yeah, and there's something about him besides sounding gay They just want to kick his ass They're like he's annoying like I just like the pound the crap right there are a lot of people who'd like to you'd have to be tempted to line I'll tell you that to line over see how for so many years Yeah, you have a backhanded event. Have you ever punched him in the mouth? No, come over though I don't like punching little people in a mouth. It's like you know We're slapping or something In the hallway Carlos said he'll slap him for you to what's in my mind I got a question is do you think it's a possibility that you manage at one time was gay or is gay now? I will I will say this I don't want to comment on that because I don't have any personal knowledge But I will say you did take a lot of showers naked with men Okay, so that's and then the other end and I find it very strange that he and Joe Rose still even after all these years After they both retired from the NFL they continue showering together like on a weekends I find that really that is pretty Yeah, and Joe He's still in for man mad dog He feels in the gap So there's something going on there. Right. Okay. Well, thanks for pointing that out to us We'll investigate immediately with not sooner. Why don't we ask them out dog if he has any gay pro club He is the one by the way gaming that first Tom Brady picture to one specger on a wall with those big flashy Ashini teeth a couple years ago It's right. Yeah, that was back when he graduated from me, Shigan before my dog Sturgeon a little bug up his ass because he won the piss he won the Super Bowl for the Patriots the evil arch enemy of the beloved Dolphin See, that's when he started a little bit sour on a little Tommy boy and a little bit jealous and a little bit angry and a little bit like not giving enough credit We're credit was do things like that and then making all those whining sounds about that Oakland game last year in the snow to snow game And they are supposed to fumble and all out of the crap, you know Did he talk it or did he caucus still hot kid about that still probably watching or replays of that and he probably would like to have shot with Tom Brady I know I sure would At least I'll admit it, you know, there's the difference. There's the rub And I will tell you this other than the high school where we're forced to do it in gym class All the rest of the years of my life. I have never shoured air with a whole bunch of other guys Have you yeah, they made you I'm other than after school. I'm talking about So it's part of PE Are you falling last season he's he's cracking other do you do PE like here?
