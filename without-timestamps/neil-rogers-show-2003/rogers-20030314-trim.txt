Why do you question? They say the things are not quite right. On Wall Street. Oh, Lord. The Dallas City Lowe ran. Regenement. On Wall Street. Well, Alan Riesman, Siskis home. Think I'm rude, she's talking to. Because my property was the only one I was free. On Wall Street. I'm gonna catch in, on my steps, on Wall Street. It's the money in my side, not Wall Street. On Wall Street. My savings would be the same as that. I stopped getting into the bench. Because it's not a joke in the way. On Wall Street. On Wall Street. On Wall Street. The Dallas City Lowe ran. On Wall Street. On Wall Street. On Wall Street. Hello. Yeah, Mr. Roder? How come I hear that echo now, George? I guess I'll go ahead. I do a nail-man named Plant. And I was going to talk to you about your billboards. Yeah. I'm in the modeling business and I have... Yeah, this is Reverend Jones. I don't know who he is. Yeah, huh, we do. Anyway, nice to hear from Reverend Jones. He could have started on a Friday. He's in the modeling business. What? He couldn't even wait for the open to finish playing. Exactly. Well, he wanted to, like, segue off since most obviously, so whipped up about the billboards and makes it into this thing like, Well, I'm Bozo. Don't you understand you're already in somebody. There's a little over the listening. We know that. We're getting to people are already listening. A little heads up on where they are because, you know, they like to show. And of course, you probably be talking about where yours is too except that most of the people don't like your show. And you only got one anyway, one small one and a billboard. With no lights on it. Right. With no lights on it. Because George and Beena Boy are up there with their ladders. Turn it like Pokemon Lights out with their show. But he went through that whole hurry attic thing. No more times than again, at the end of the show. I thought he was going to bust a gut. He's been like pop on right there at the end of the show. It's funny or every other time he does it. In addition to which Disney always tells you he doesn't listen to this show. And you saw how does he know I'm talking about the billboard locations. We even plug where his billboard was too, which I noticed there's he don't care about that. See, it's the idea that the people who are already listening. They're curious. They want to see what they look like. It's not a question that we don't understand that they're already listening. We do know that. I understand you're a lot sharper than we are, okay? Lot sharper than our Ginsu knives. We understand that, Schmendrick. But the fact of the matter is that that we like to tell our people because they want to see an addition of which my face is on here because it's like that's my face. That's why I'm radio. And another is done. I'm as beautiful as Howard Stern lovely. No. Whoever said that people on radio had faces for outside. But that doesn't mean if you have a Howard Stern billboard, his picture might not be on it. Or done. I'm as it looks like a dead man or me who looks like whatever I look like crap. Who cares? See, because we're not vain. We're not trying to project something. Some phony image that some people do. I'm not going to mention no names. I can't stop. I know. I can't help yourself. It's your thing. It's you. And speaking of him speaking of them. If you go to the website right now or any time you get a chance, but right now it'd be a good time. Good good chuckle. Anybody hasn't seen it. Go to thearages.com right now. Scroll down under the pool, which by the way, the Howard Stern people mess with our pool right at the end and you see that? Yeah, I'm mad. They didn't fool us. Mad dog wanted. All right. But at any rate underneath the appell result, where it says features, you'll see the lovely Troy strapper formally number 23. My me dolphin running back. We used to be a good guy. And he's got the stolen, how are David and we can't hear a piece on there. Look at that. And it like, it's hopping up and down. It's your up and down. All of our Troy's head. That's a beautiful thing. We put on the spare. The spare hair. Woo! In fact, that was the piece that was going to be. If we had most picture out of Billboard, that was the piece that we're going to have on there. But that's why we couldn't put the picture. We lost the piece of the Billboard changes. Troy intercepted it. So here's the addresses of the Billboard. It's just amazing to me how whipped up to our friends he is about that. Which I guess what he's really poured off about is the fact that we got what four or five. And he's got that one little dinky Billboard. Well, that shows what they think he and what we're saying much. It ain't much. And you don't know why? If there's a buck I smell it. That's the problem. You got you nose up the wrong asses. Anyway, 1562 votes allegedly on yesterday's pool. While PD Lenny was in here, Hock and a Chinese. I thought that's a lot of a sudden they were busy. Did it over the pool. Because Mado was a head comfortably. About 15 votes all morning long. I kept peeking at it and the pool too. Well, it's big and a peeking at a boy was George. I'm telling you, when you're wrong, you go away off. I mean, we already covered this. You didn't see the first time. No, we covered this off the year. Yes, sir. We're going to cover it on the year. You didn't see the first. Because I promoted the hell out of the show. Are you hot on ABC? There was a full page ahead and some of what I've ever for it. And I was promoting a crap out of it. I saw it. You didn't. And you saw it. And you said, ah, they show blow is by the end. And that was it. Because I asked you how to hold was. They had a weak bunch of people. They had a weak bunch the first week. You could spell it with two ease within EAK. How there was weak. And you love to run so much. I watched it. It's got nothing to do with Lorenzo. I don't really care who the judges are. That's just, that says. What? Meaningless. So nobody watches that. So it's just show to see who the judges are. All of Lorenzo looked like he used to some of us might. What is this saying? What is this? Neil, Wayne Wright. The time when or the triple crown in the 30 to 40s died. Wayne Wright. What does that mean? I don't know. I thought it means in the 30s, in 40s. Oh my God. From Rick, unless the 120 years old. Thank you. Rick for the Civilating Information. Anyway, we'll get back to are you hot. Which inspired me for our poll day. We got a great poll about reality TV shows. Which I didn't realize it was like 6,000 of. Anyway, yesterday we asked our very growing poll man. The popularity is incredible. What do we up to? 45,000 votes now since since they looked away. Yes. Ha ha ha ha ha. There's just going wild. Look at that. Are you checking those numbers? Yeah. It was like 1400s. Some odd one. PD Lenny came and now one doesn't have 1600s. What did the last number be for printed this out was 1562 votes. Howard Stern 295 mad dog 291. Which we know. It's bogus. The Howard sperm people are pumping in like crazy. Now it gets it's part of that ego thing again. You know, it is what it is. Just accepted mad dog. More people listen to mad dog. Listen to this show than anybody else. Howard Stern was a very strong second. Was he good horse race? Phil Henry had 176 he was third. Are you sure? Fat Rush Limbaugh had 155. Schmidt had 133 and of course a lot of those, uh, especially the Schmidt votes yesterday were phony. They were also porn in like in clumps and clusters. The hopper at 116. High Goldbrookburg. Randy Rhodes. How did it in 4 which I'm still? Do you really believe that? Yeah. You kept saying that all day yesterday. I believe it. Taida. Taida. Hmm. Just a sound of that. Just makes me. Bob and Tom was was all small potatoes after that. Bob and Tom at 52. Paul and old Ron on Zeta 44. Joe and Mark had 30 even beating out Mohour David and they're on and luck in a wee hours at the morning when nobody's awake and they still had more votes. For people listen to them, uh, then Mohour David and they had 30 he had 28. Pretty weak mo. No what are he so belligerent? Oh, so? Roamy had 23. I think he still pissed off about the, um, the Rean vines. Either what I mean, no, it's play it. I think he's really got a big buck up his old smelly. Right, though. We've got a bug up his ass man. A big, it's calling around in there. It's robbing him nuts. See that opens up the Pandora's box for some more homophobic comments. You can make on Monday. Take some notes, Moh. That's his main thing. Anti women and tie fags. That's that's basically the whole thing on your show now. If that wouldn't surprise me if we have a whole bunch of women's and gear organizations go after his ass now. What about the dikes? Uh, what did I just say? Gate organizations. Mohour David is at 28. This boy yesterday other than the award radio personality, listen to most. A Jim Rome, Rome he had 23. Steve Kane 16. Jeff the forest 14. It was the late edition before with his 85 billboards. By the way, today will be telling you where all a defos billboards are too. George Nuri, LB, silk doctor, Laura had 13. Rick Shaw had 11. Ricky Tickey Tom join her to fly jog head nine. A caplan at eight. Joyce Kaufman six. Joe Rose had six. The big left band had five and forty. Three. That's because we don't have his like little kids to listen to. His show. They don't listen over here on AM. And certainly not on this station. Eddie not the chronic asshole. Facts are says the new fashion of freedom this and freedom that is opposed to French this and French that. So it's a really nice thing. I'll only further solidify these stupidity of Americans because the funny thing is they actually are flemished fries, lamssafried of lambest spritus. Which are Belgian and with the Belgian who invented French, but where do they stand on this issue? Between rock and hard and the Iran. It was the illiterate of the Western Hemisphere decided they were French fries to begin with love. You tons thanks for continuing to try John the shallow mine of Craig Marseille's Eddie another Eddie not the chronic. Thank you Eddie not the chronic. Thank you very much. The Belgians invented. So as if we have to do this if these people are compelled to show their childish the why can't we just call them fries don't we anyway. But fries with that nobody says you want French fries with that nobody says that. Large fries. Nobody goes into a drive through a burglar king and says oh give me a big mac or whatever to hell it is that what what they sir. What's burrking. What's burrking. What's a guinea wiper and an order a large French fry. Huh? Anybody say that? No of course not. But there are some people who just have to make a big similar to everything just to make their point. Where are you French fries and we do hit the French but for different reasons. Sure. We always hated the French at least we're consistent. Oh look at this or Elizabeth's or deal. Oh Elizabeth's are to come safe by the way. Oh. And we got more of her relatives on there all over the place. Or police say she suffered psychological damage isn't that shocking or she's surprised. Aren't you surprised? Wow. Oh, I again I don't want to make light of it but it's just and then last night the speaking of bad hairpieces. Aaron Brown with a really bad red hairpiece on here looks like a beaver dot on his head. He's gone to his little speech he has like a little monologue he goes through 10 o'clock every night and about well we don't apologize for the coverage here because nothing is really changed in the u.n around the war front above and above and above and this is a feel good story about how we found Elizabeth. Yeah, I try to rationalize the fact that the media are in a feeding frenzy over the story and just go into the ground like they do with everything else on and on and on and on and on and over and over until you got Elizabeth smart coming out of every or fishing your body. Right. Oh, I'm saying enough is enough already. Well, when you get a little more information about these scumbags that kidn after and when he decide what time and what channel they're going to blow their brains out on national TV then let us know then we'd like to hear that. But other than that I think we've heard more than enough from all these relatives and this is another thing that's disturbing to me is that all the friends and relatives every time one of these things comes along they just can't get enough coverage. They can't be on enough networks. They can't be on enough to thank everybody after the first 500 times it gets to be a little bit pondish. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I know what you're saying. The uncles, you know the uncles they want their 15 seconds of fame. Anyway, I'm a co-wate George said, are you hot was really hot last night? It's a great show and now they're finally catching on and finally again. Oh, but that's just a parade of flesh and I say, Oh, right. That's what we want last night was hot last night was just fine. There was something there for everybody even if you don't like Lorenzo Lama's who cares. 913 at 560 WDQM it's getting to be 100 degrees in the shade just about every day in fact it's going to warm up here this week and 50s.

Fampions of past destruction. 3,000 people killed. Our now forgotten. Let's exploit him instead. Hey, there's oil to be cognizant. Going after said not to. Plank NATO's summer. There's no longer mention of the name in Lodis. But no it's safe concerned. A man complaces believe in every word of this cartel In administration that controls us by fear. Through leading a manipulation and a right wing. His drilling head over and over into our heads. Daddy, rag, has some. Waffin' of past destruction. The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying. We're all suspects now not see us from this city. I have nothing to hide. Table talkers all are safe. I know be the handle don't ask.

Wars starts Tuesday. Out of black. Aren't you lucky, yeah? And you're thinking about something. What's important, nearly when there's anything going on in the world. Our station might be one of the last. Did anybody with tune into a message of ball game or some kind of a golf tournament? Or some crap like that? Like a sports emergency? But. That's sports. That's a great line. We ought to have a sounder for that. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. But seriously, because thanks to our good friends at Chief Channel. Yeah. There is no more news station. Right. So they're locked into like Dr. Laura and Lardash and stuff like that. So, nor is there any local talk. What? I said local. I see. That's right. Doesn't go on those. Well, what time is she on anyway? The goddess. Okay. I have no idea. I'll have to do this. She can't beat you. Crazy. How would I know? How to hold her. Well, I'll tell you. Ask. Leonard. He might know. Peter. I think she's on any afternoon. But forgetting about that. So the idea is since we have the flexibility, like if something's happened in the Where do you just? The diplomat from one of the other. Thank you, Paula. You just open up the pot and there it is. So the moment that the hostility start when you're on here anyway, you just open it up. Put it up. You're going to have a big week next week. I think because it was started Tuesday. Oh, huh? And we'll have lots of food in here so that we can just eat and listen to. We can have a big war party. Sounds good to me. I'll bring my war paint. I'm going to come down for, but I doubt it. So here's the poll today. And again, I don't care what anybody says. You're entitled to your own opinion. This is a good show. And you know, assholes like Tom Jickick and right. Wow, this is just gratuitous flesh. You know what? That's what the public wants to, including me, including George, including Carlos, and probably including Tom, you know. We're not looking for so much intellectual stimulation on TV. Maybe once in a while, you know? Right. A flesh parade. Right. A flesh parade. What's wrong with that? That's what the public wants, right? Right. FNA and FNA. So my poll question today. And I realized it was going to be such a star-spangled banner of so many shows. God. Yeah. Because you know the greater originality of TV. If there's one, there's a bill. If there's one, and it's a hit, there's a thousand. Although, you notice how fast the quishio thing peed it out on a kind of its sucked, maybe? And kind of the quishio is they came up with sucked, and I kind of the fact that they just drove them into the ground who wants to be a millionaire 15 times a week, and they killed it. Like everything else television touches, they kill it. They butcher it. And that's all they know how to do. Right. Overdo where they like the Elizabeth Smart thing, like the alien stuff. They can't just do it and do it well. If somebody catches on and somebody says, hey, we like that. Oh, great. It's like if you had a steak. Yeah. And you said, when I was at the list, it's like, oh, here, have ten more. Oh, no, I just only wanted one. No, here, have twenty more. And you finally start puking on steak. You know, you finally start up chucking meat. Anyway, which TV reality showed you like best speaking of meat? Are you hot? 13 nights on ABC by the way, to have an excellent panel last night. And there were like, I would say three guys and three chicks. They were like, pretty goddamn good. And maybe more than that. I forget. There was, there were good. Huh? I can't remember that one girl's name. Did we figure it out before the show? Oh, like Rachel. Rachel, yeah. Yeah. See? I know. Rachel and then it was, and I even looked back. If you go to their website, are you hot? They got the contestants from all four or five weeks. Whatever that's been on here. They're all on there. And there's some people that quite frankly. They're picture shouldn't be on my billboard. They can have better pictures. That's just bigger but like. Oh, when you look like that, how could you have your picture on the billboard? You want people that, yeah, I didn't really, didn't really bother me. Everybody knows what I looked like. And I look, I'm going to old, uh, bag. It looks bad. And it's where it goes. I got a face for radio. Doesn't bother me. I saw it again. See this morning. That's what happens when you're a personality when you're a celebrity. Is people know what you look like. And to be honest with you, there's lovely king on CNN right now. They just showed his ugly post. Huh? Yeah, I'm not even in the same category with him when it comes to ugly. But he don't mind. See what I'm saying? Mm-hmm. Look there. Right? The Virginia and the gunslinger. Right from my white or, uh, and the smoke. But, uh, I mean, everybody was like, going into the lone ranger, the lone stranger, uh, a wild Bill hitchcock. They were all on there. And the same with cop show, the same thing. Uh-huh. So TV if something goes over, man, like, oh, it's a hit. It's a freaking hit. Like Robert Dubel said, it's a big, big fat-titted hit. Remember that? Yes, they do. Yeah. That was Howard Veele, of course. And maybe they could have Howard Veele as one of the, uh, that's right. He's dead. Yeah, man. See if they just had Peter Fincher round. They could have him on to do one of the judges on, are you hot? He was mad at Howard Veele. Oh, I was so good at that. Oh, oh. Maybe they could just pop his body up there to replace Lorenzo Lomis to make you happy Since you hate Lorenzo Lomis so much. You're just jealous because of how he used to look. Whatever. Look at it this way. He don't look so great anymore. So, yeah. He got a feel pretty good about that. He's looking worse by the day. What was that movie he was in with all the snakes? Snake eater. But there was no snakes in it. Well, me, he was a snake. Yeah, otherwise there was he kept grappling with that. There's a snake eater too. He's a goofball. But he sure did use to look good. In fact, he could have been on that show as a contestant as opposed to a panelist. But you're right. He's doing the Howard Stern routine. I funny you mentioned that to me this morning because that's how I listened to him doing the judging last night. I thought he started to sound like Howard. You know, I don't mean our Howard. Reigning back and trying to be cool and just shot out. I like him. Just but you're okay. My book reminds me of don't hate any crap off his little Lombe and Anna. This Guava Eden spick. Twenty seven past nine and five sixty WCWM. That's going to be a regular on my schedule is are you hot? Huh? Hey, more are you hot? No. I'm telling you all this. It's really hot. That's Emile Coach Chinese buffet. In fact, whether you're lovely, whether you're ugly, whether you're slim, whether you're a gigantic tub. And of course, that all the phases you'll see some people. You'll think, what are they doing at a buffet? Why are they just? Well, that's how they got like that. Practice makes perfect. Three locations of the great Emile Coach Chinese buffet is trying this weekend. Go for a feast before the war starts. And then always a good idea to like stir up for the famine. Sure. You'll find him in sunrise, North Army beats in their newest location in Pembro Pines. Everything is fresh and delicious. Nothing sits out there getting moldy and oldy. Six different kinds of soups. They got dozens of succulent entrays. Oriental surf and turf on a weekend. Like this weekend. And New York stiff made order if that great gourmet set of that say sizzling Asian grill. Or they feature teriyaki steak and shrimp and chicken and seafood handcarp primer. I'll cook your order.

No MSG, no cornstarch and a cook only with cholesterol free oils. There are buffet features a full salad bar, a new sushi bar, fresh shrimp cocktail, and even better news, Emerald Coast's famous lobster feast is back featuring lobster thermometers and lobster bisc.

You know, in about the 3 to 4th hour, you don't want to dessert bar featuring pies and cakes, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite toppings and fresh fruit. The perfect ending to a major major pig out. Three locations of the great Emile Coach Chinese buffet is in sunrise, Pine Island of 44th Street. There are Collins Avenue, just north of 163rd Street, north Miami Beach, and also a theatre-sister flamingo and Pembroke Road's in prestigious Pembroke Pines. Look for the new Oriental chicken salad to a thermal coast. They've set reservations to come to the Vivailleville 2 called 954-5723822. 954-5723822, give it a shot this weekend. You'll love it. The Emerald Coast Chinese buffet. 9556485. Feel Rodger. Can I do it? Dole and Clinton. Let me ask you something, Bob. Would you like to look for it? I'm Dulls, as money I mean. Over time she makes a speech. She's staring up at the sky. Yeah. I'll let you taste something that I wrecked. I ordered 79 bomb emissions in Iraq back in 98, but your people put a stop to it. Desert Fox Ring of Bell. But Bob Dulls says, you've got a blow job. Yeah, Paul. All your fault. Your people who fixated with my penis, and still are the fail to win the race. Laced out on me that he held from my penis. Bob Dulls could always use a hand. Bob, those girls are so much you're wearing. You want a date or not my type man. Bob, can you do this? Bob Dulls says, no. Oh, you really fast. Look, I'm making a jatt of puppets. Not even in the same room, stupid. I know you can't see me. I'll see him the main communist. Damn, don't. You got my check. 934-562-WM. Now is that for real online one or is that a joke? Carlos. It's real. It says, Paolo Park, Brian Sears, huh? Hello. I have to get Brian. He's right next to me. I ride around the level of the morning and I've heard you praise Brian Sears. And I said, well, I got away to my conduit as barren. Because he's not usually here in the morning. Right here right now, about 10 feet. He was waiting like five minutes. Let me just hold him two seconds. There he comes. Brian, here he is. He's on the air. There he comes. He was standing there while you're doing the whole monologue. Here he comes. There this is a man of course. Just sweetheart. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi, this Brian Sears. Is it really? Yes. This Brian Sears. Yeah. I just called the, I enjoyed your show and thanks for all the things that I wanted to say. How long you sticking around Brian? I'm going to sit down here till the middle of April. Really? Yeah. Well, thanks for being there. Okay, well appreciate your show and, uh, You go for good work. And you too. And no more than 8-1 night, okay, Brian? Okay. That's going to be the limit. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think I don't know if that was for real or not. Do we know if that was for real or not? I guess it could have been. It was while we had a seat doing a voice. How's it going, A-Wally? So that takes care of our calls. You had a whole bunch of money for a minute, but I guess they ran away. Which is fine with me, you know? The pull is up. I don't think we're going to get big response on this pull. You want to know why? Take a look at what's leading. I put a 40-voteer. We get a quick 40-voteer. As soon as it goes up, it's 21. They all suck. Yeah. We can all sit around watching Sean Hannity or whatever. Have the popular thing to say, but the reality of it all is that's for you. I mean, nobody's tracing your vote. We don't have to come to your house and check out which ones you're watching. They don't all suck. In fact, if I wouldn't have been for our real world and road rules, they had some plenty of moments on there too in their time. Real world this season is a whole new level. Is it really? Well, not for you. Oh. Well, I'm just saying for whatever anybody wants to see it. Oh, God. You can't be talking about that. I did go out for the intellectuals out there all through them. I did go out and get the books yesterday that I was looking for. I desperately must have been my lucky day. Propetra War for perpetual peace by Gorbidol. And a hunting of the president by Joe Kahnison and Gene Lyons, which is a big thick book. Like almost 400 pages. It's big and it's thick. That's what Bubba said. The hunting of the president, the tenure campaign to destroy a Bill and Hillary Clinton. Excellent book. Are we scan through it? 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. 8 million bedtime stories from the table. It's today. So if nobody's got any material, that's okay with me because we got tons and tons of crap here. Let's see, Survivor 5, the Osborne's 5, they all suck 29. That's our crowd sour. Your sour folks quit being so sour. I know your stuck there. That's your problem. And the lion. Yeah, I'm out of the, you don't know if they're lying or not. But why are they so good? They're negative on everything. Oh, you know the answer to that. You're always accusing me. Oh, another one on Neil's negative pulls. Well, this isn't negative. We're asking you what do you like the best. That's a positive. You like anything? No. Is there anybody that you like? Oh, you like yourself? I like me. We a world MTV 3, fear factor 2, are you hot. Scott appear and one of those is mine. So 53 votes. Small potato is nothing. We just haven't hit on. Of course we didn't put more Howard David on this poll or Howard Stern. So it just ain't going to get the kind of response that we're looking for. Very sad. So it's appropriate that I'm handing the keys of the king to you for the next week. Because you can see that the tremendous enthusiasm we had from then most of this week. Right on the toilet. You know what I mean? Well, they're busy doing what? Don't take it. That's right. Okay, I'm keeping it. And that's right. Get ready for Tuesday and more. Here's Miami. Hello. Good morning. My second. Yeah. Thanks, ma'am. You know, it's not for. I keep bringing the food. I will. Okay. Okay. And you know, I'm going to see that. He's been forced on the way up to Boka. By the way, don't, uh, right. Your neck looking at your thing on a turn pipe. Spinning around like Linda Blair trying to get one last peak. Why he's got to see it in the daytime because you can't see it at night. That billboard. Doesn't have your picture on your Mo. Trust Bradford told the piece five, six, seven, and anybody see that thing on our website. That's not for it, I keep forgetting. Keep forgetting where I'm on here. Here's Boiton Beach, hello. Hey, Neil. Nice to meet you. I went out and I bought the Michael Moore book. And I bought another one of his books called Gown-sized This. Right, that was the book one. Yeah, have you read that one? No. You gotta get your hands on that one too. That one's all about corporate America and it's a lot like a movie Roger and me about closing down the factories and all of these different things that unfortunately it's written in 96. So a lot of the politics have changed since then. But the policies are still the same within the corporations and the contributions from to the political parties are still coming from the same places. So it still semi-relative. Excellent book, though. Okay. Yeah, give it a read. Okay, thanks. Michael Moore likely to win Oscars a matter of fact. If all the scenarios plows is predicted if the US invades a rack next week and Michael Moore wins the best documentary category for bowling for Columbine, the 70-Fist-Doss Awards ceremony in March 23rd will be historically controversial event. Given the intense divisions over the war in the US especially in the anti-war Hollywood community, when by Moore could eclipse such historically political years of 72 and 78. In the first case, Marlon Brando sent a model dressed as an Apache woman to reject his best actor award for the godfather and a protest and be half an Native American in 1978 a pro-Palestinian Vanessa Redgrave on best actress Virginia and refer to Zion as Tudalums from the stage of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion where protesters burned her an FG outside. Moore's angry documentary condemns American culture as paranoid, gun crazy at home and militaristic abroad put him in front of a worldwide audience of a billion you can expect a forceful tie-weight against President George W. and his war plans. It says on the surface, bowling for Columbine's Oscar win seems as much as a foregone conclusion as the onset of the bombing and Baghdad. How do you like that? In a course, he couldn't get it to film to the American. Oh, he had to come up here to Canada to find people who would film a form. All we don't want to put that propaganda on here, right? No, we don't want to. So there you go, the great Michael Moore, but we don't want to talk about stuff like that. We want to talk about reality show. Oh, and they don't, they hate him 54. How many of us votes we got? 54 out of 101. Almost half say they all suck. They suck. You suck. Survivor 9, the Osborne's 9 real world MTV 6, are you hot Scott 5, blind A3 and American Adler?

We don't have a topic Are you been talking about the reality show? No, that's not that's the polls not the topic go ahead. Hockey hockey hockey a couple of things Tell you more play seven shifts gets a wipe dog his injuries on crutches may never play again. I still want to go Go heroin Blood lead three times last night losing overtime to Calgary four or three falling leaves man These deluded people here they're all talking Stanley cup. They're there and they're on drugs. They're on crack go ahead What did you think of these Valerie Burray Trit? What do you mean I think of it? It's it's the wasn't a trade it was just unloading salary. This is what they keep doing Do you know anything about the guy you got though? No, I know but he ever raised just another kid. He's just another prospect Not just another kid. He actually had a great rookie year last year He didn't make it. We think Louis this year because the problem was his great rookie year was in direct Sir, sir, I don't want to say this to you. Let me say this to you right now. Can I say something to you? They unloaded salary and the fact is they can have all these promising youngsters for as long as they want But if they're going to continue not using the money from Pablebury salary and Valeriebury salary everybody else that they dumped out of there They're they're going to continue to be nothing but years of frustration net franchises in big big trouble They've got the nucleus of what could be a really good team if they have had some if they had some Fetterman guys in her how would you like to still have Ray Whitney and Mike Sons your in Scott Melon beyond the team Scott Melon be his court foregoals And one game last week. I understand that I'm a huge boy fan Well, I'm just honey they they've they've got to the team you know and to kind of have it a bunch of of underpaid huh One of the guys you didn't even mention was two blinds that takes two blinds that's ancient history Yeah, I mean people that want to keep talking about that that's ancient history But I'm just talking about it the last year and a half or two years It's my other question. Why is it the teams like New Jersey and Detroit? Always are able to make great deals with the trade deadlines don't these other organizations get tired of it like the fans do I mean how does Detroit give Matthew Schneider trade deadline? I don't know if Matthew Schneider I think he's highly overrated But I'd rather have Matthew Schneider than Phil Howsley was 100 years old But because Detroit is willing to spend the money they fill that place every night They make a fortune they got a ton of money and that's why they do it It's like it's like the Rangers now who are still within shouting business and making it because they got a 75 million dollar payroll You realize the Panthers payroll as they third or fourth lowest and league it's $22 million Joe even even the Buffalo Sabres who are just being bought thank God to save them out through the deals Master when I'll do so but even the Sabres who've got a bigger payroll in the Panthers How do you compete when you're not paying anybody when you're not bringing any asses in the seas? This group man Alan Cohen and his buddies you know, they may have met meant the best But they had no clue what they were getting into they have no idea what they're doing Now, I mean I've only been down to maybe it does in games this year But it's still the same will thing.

It was a good crowd for the Montreal game They're one four thousand people there for that game I'm like no Seriously, I saw the power I saw the telecast here on TSN okay on the sports network and they paned And they should they were talking about how this this place isn't drawing any people in the Florida France crisis got to get some asses in the seats They paned back and showed that arena in the middle of the first period if there were 4,000 people Their my name is Danny Gallivan okay and of the 4,000 maybe a hundred new anything about the game The right but that'll be side to point, but you know they still got to get the cash man They got to get some asses in the seats and they're not gonna do it by missing the playoffs every year Right Yes, sir I don't think he's all I bet I think he he want to Stanley couple the red wings exactly I think I think that was a good deal in addition to which they shot book-wired at a hold him up for big buck Shawn Birk is I don't I think he's overrated Exactly, I think I think they did good Yeah, okay good luck to pal good luck to the Leafs won't eat it dog Gilmore seven shifts But I'm being by by Dougie and I see you again.

one twelve go to the mimey international and it looks just like me on earth's uh nine to one five sixty w qm all right you know i'm a little bit leery of one thing on a billboard they look great but like on hanks it says the hammer three to seven in one i mean i mean anybody doesn't know that that's his nickname on a station and that they have no idea that it's ankle burrs you want to say it because hanks been around a market for hundred years right they might think it's on seahammer right that's right market is kind of a different audience but i'm serious i mean i guarantee i hanks been on the station what about seven years on qm longer than us the six seven years whatever it's been and you know people know hanko burrs they know the name and and like when he goes on the s p n the i don't know because i don't think i've ever seen hanko he has been on the abc thing with a racing but like they don't say oh well here's uh the hammer is talk about the you can tucky derby is hanko burrs it's just my own i mean i could be wrong i'm certainly not probably can we got five billboard that's right let's talk it up big so thanks Miguel i just assure we appreciate it stop by mom

derine said derine the queen the vanson machine that was up forty five that has that however has the just a little bit two and a half points in the negative red arrow so they come up with his middle east proposal now is your most important Palestinian state and the Palestinians have to do this and about to be put a group of them and so it isn't as interestingly should have been doing this like two years ago yeah wasn't uh but doing that and you remember the comments or we're not going to get bogged down in the middle either the whole Israeli Palestinian thing like the Clinton administration did we're not going to get bogged down you know we got bigger fish to fry like kicking away everybody civil rights and then all of a sudden nine eleven happened now all of the same isolation is bashed now all of a sudden they're experts all over the world we're going to solve that and of course if they do see it seems to me because they told CBS news which I forgot to mention any moment less less than uh of less than clarity they tell CBS news i guess what um al-qaeda is in total this array in fact and rather had it on last night you see it on the CBS news yeah that al-qaeda's basically beat but on the other hand in the same sentence they're saying uh wow uh but we know there's going to be another attack and they're going to kill a bunch of innocent people they just can't they just can't do what i think they did before so in other words a bunch of double talk but if that's true and of course there are many other terrorist groups but if that's true since they were the main focus of our purpose and if this middle east peace thing is going to get that those are two more reasons not to be going into a rack so what i'm saying yeah and not to be stirring up the whole Muslim world again everybody whipped up into a frenzy if we're looking if our goal is really peace instead of war say she won't send no it's an awful lot of sense to me let's walk the fortet's nest is dead yeah let's
