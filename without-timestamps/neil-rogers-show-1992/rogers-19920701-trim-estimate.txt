Do we know how to get to that new audience or what? 1106Wild. Brower. Look at that. Brower is like an acoma. The whole rest of the state is like flagellating and mander's squeezing it and jumping on it and Brower's like, ah, where do we find it? Well, I'll tell you where we find it right on the bat line. Hello? Uh-oh. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! It's like a voice from a past. Oh my god, the day has lost. The day has lost. It is all over. Oh, I know what I know what I know it. This isn't Bob Lasseter is it? Uh, I think it is. Now are we telling people where you are because I haven't said anything. Well, it is. Yes, sure. You're not a bearish by it. No. You ought to be happy about it. We had Bob called me at home last night and we had a long chat on his dime no less, which I know will never happen again. Well, the story that you talked to me. And Bob Lasseter is out of the business for which we say congratulations. And you know, tell me an incredible story and I just can't imagine anybody having their life turned upside down in his business. Unless they're alone or with somebody. Another typical radio tale. All the people that I've known through the years who have had their lives just turned to a pile of horse droppings from this business. And he incompetent assholes in it. And here is a monster in the broadcasting industry in Davenport, Iowa now on the beach. Just kind of sitting back and reading a good form here. The old there. There is many beach and Davenport. And that's what I mean, reading the good form here. Well, yeah. But we raised blood worms. I play a lot of put put. We don't want to go into your personal life. But anyway, well, be your wife is with you though, right? Oh, yes. Bob and his lovely wife are there in Davenport, Iowa. Just kind of escaping from this horrendous business after being chased out of W. Walson, Chicago by the horrendous executives and bureaucrats at capital cities broadcasting or some of the dumbest people in this business. Even rivaling Cox broadcasting, which is saying a lot, saying a lot. But you know, after this a week and a half that we've done this experiment with Tampa and the whole rest of the state, you know what I've discovered? What? That basic, oh, man. You notice with just the one word, he like pierces, you like right to the gut. Basically, you were saying last night something about Tampa and the same peed being like over here. In other words, they're not big cities. They're just like all these little divided. What do you call him? It's a palate of the old principalities. Principalities, just like here where we got your plantation and sunrise and surf side and howl there is no Miami and there is no Fort Lauderdale and there is no Tampa and there is no St. Pete. It's just a bunch of little like you're even New Yorks. Yeah, I know a lot of places like lights and, uh, lights, get it right out of there. Well, I always refer to them as lights. As in clubs. So anyway, Bob, but how long at W. F. LA, which by the way he hates them like poison and is going to tell you stories that will make you never listen to that station. W. F. LA about two years. Yeah. And head like 13 shares on W. F. LA. Yeah. Yeah. Am I going to do all the talk in here? I was planning on leaving in a few minutes and just leaving you on the phone to talk to everybody. Well, you know, that's okay too. I just trying to ask your question. Was I imagine you have nothing but time on your hands? I've been walking around the house now for about 12 hours singing, you know, he topped two of me. Why do you say that? Well, because frequently, you know, when you call me a lot, just the home, you get things like, yeah. Well, because you were a pain in the ass, then now this man, I want to tell you something. Bob was a radio, yenta is the best expression I can think of. And was just constantly, I mean, now I understand why having heard the stories, but just constantly calling and probing for information. And what's going on at QAM? What's going on at the light bulb? What's going on? And just it just got to the point where, like, you know, in the eighth inning of the club game, you're telling him, hey, no, I'm not. Yes, you are. Okay, I made it up. Last time I talked to you QAM was full. Well, I'm just going to punch, you're still in the blank, whatever the station might be. You were a radio yenta, you confessed up to what? I didn't leave, you I had to make a window. Oh, you had my expendal, but he wasn't taking your calls. We're the EO took my calls. Yeah, he'll take anybody's calls, believe me. So anyway, Bob was in Tampa with these gigantic numbers, went to WLS and Chicago. The last time I saw Bob Lacer, it was one of our trips it was two years ago. Two summers ago at Murphy's bleachers across from Riggley Field and Bob came in. They opened up, they pride open the door with a shoehorn and got Bob and I both in there, which is quite in the accomplishment and we attended for a couple hours. And now back in those days, I thought you were doing okay at LLS. I thought you were happy. Oh, no, there was already hits if you're a trouble. But you just didn't want to say it because you need the job. Well, you know, get out of here. Yes, I do. When you're in a business, you lie a lot. Oh, I'd great deal. I can just imagine, can you imagine the reverberations over there on the West Coast, all those old ladies who love Bob Lacer? Hello, Bob. No, no, Neil. I had young men. I didn't have any old ladies. You had young men? Yeah. Well, we'll probably talk about that when we come back. Oh, goodie. Think up some good stories. All right, hold on, I don't go away. You've got a lot of time for us today, right? There's much of you. Because we have nothing but time and you already got people on their way to talk to you. And they're going to say, oh, Bob, people, you said you're breath of fresh air. Do you hear your voice? You know, Holly's phony bass to Zari, you know? I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah. Hold on. Okay. 12 minutes after 11 at News Talk Radio 610 Wild. 11 15 at Wild. That's her. Oh, you've got a narrow right. Oh, man. Bob? Yeah, I'm still here. That was just an act of technical history on my part. I punched the wrong thing. I put my finger in the wrong spot. Anyway, what was about to say? So let's go back to WLS and Chicago where Bob was making all his big bucks. And all the other big bucks. And we're allegedly making Chicago stand out of its rear and it was boring as crap, right? Bob, I'm going to have the station. Oh, yes. What they were doing? I'm very, what? I just have the station. Well, there's anybody out there who wants to know why Bob Lancet is no longer on the ear. These first ten minutes should give you a great revelation. You're on sand like a guy who woke up one morning and lost the gift of game. Yeah, there. What? I'm talking to you. What? I'm talking to you. What? I'm talking to you. I'm talking to my radio. What? Let's take a call from Pinole's Park. Okay. This probably is one of your big fan. Hello. Hey. Good morning. Yes, sir. Hey, Bob. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. It's an awesome serity. It's great to hear your voice. You left FLA. The Norman died. That station went to hell. And I can say it. And now they're a J.K. or a broad car. I mean, J.K. or. And, uh, looks like they all be changing format again. Why don't you come back to Tampa Bay, Bob? I don't know. No one will hire me. Yeah. Surely well. A way to September. There will be plenty of openings at FLA. Or even maybe here at S.U.N. There you go. And why? Why? Why? I don't know. I'll give a one hour after their after their chapter, uh, seven, eleven, thirteen, fourteen, go through. With, uh, their, their situation there. But it, talk radio here in Tampa. The worst. Every, all the listeners who will talk in a test Bob has certainly gone down about, uh, hundred fifty percent, she left. It's cute. I do it. Real bad. I don't know. If I have to. You, I have. I still bring out the tapes of yours once in a while with you and the old guy in the trail of park and the old man's. Mr. Erstring. Yeah. And the other guy, so religious guy used to call you on it, shall we all the time? Jacob. Jacob and his wife, with the high bowl and, uh, it was a, it was wonderful. But when we're going to get a laugh, remember what good top radio was in this area. I bring out one stop. Well, thank you. Well, thank you. The great talk and see you and you sincere. You truly aren't missed here in Tampa Bay. Thank you. Thank you so much sir. Have a great life. Great. And the checks in the mail. Okay. They did, which I think says a lot about that area. So anyway, WLS, uh, we kept going down in tubes and they have bush being bang on in midday, which, uh, thanks for itself. Like every other desperate station that can't put on live local talent. Like, if our life, for example, at once his tapes on taped a lino less and post fun of this, you went because they're bringing in stuff from out of the market. No, are you serious? Yes. Unreal. That, Opey. I mean, he's like, oh, well, you know, that syndicated stuff doesn't work. And meanwhile, I got that the clown on the ear on tape. That's fat right wing fascists Nazi pig. Well, wait a second. Wait a second. Opey is a fine broadcaster. He's a man of integrity. Uh, that's a real horn leader. I'm in the, you know, prone to taking bubble. Oh, man. I knew there was a lot of that crap in on the ground in Davenport, but you have must have been spent all your spare time shoveling it up. Here's a lady in, uh, clear water. Bob, last, it's a, this is T.J. T.J. How you doing? I'm just doing fun. My God. It's so great to hear your voice. I can't believe it. I'm so excited. I think the least you can do is thank me for bringing Bob on today. I, I do thank you, Neil. You know, I'm so excited. I can't stand it. I don't understand what you're listening to. Neil, for I mean, he doesn't do topics or anything like that. Are you aware of it? He doesn't. I wish he would, and that's why I'm just dying to hear your topics again. You know, I'm so happy. It's so bad. It is so bad that I can't stand it. You know, they can do actually 10 hours discussing the month of the month. The month of August. And you know, what the, the good things are about August. It's, it's, it's, it's like that. Absolutely disgusting. On top of that, it's so, so, so boring. I know the best thing about August is that most people go out of time on vacation. They don't have to listen to WFL. That's, that's the whole thing. But anyway, Bob, God, we miss you. Well, I miss you too. Please come back. We get out the syrup. Oh, God, it's getting so sweet in here. I'm going in a diabetic coma. Anyway, I'll tell you, remember when you left town, I remember this and I treasure this because I was your very last caller. I got on like the last minute before you left. June 26th, three years ago. Pardon? With June 26th, three years ago. Not that he's been crammed. About three years ago, I'll tell you, it seems like 10. You need to come back because talk radio is not the same. It is absolutely awful. And you were the best. I'm sorry, Neil. I haven't listened to you long enough so I couldn't really tell. Right. You haven't listened long enough to hate me yet, but you will in a couple of weeks. Well, that's all right. I don't mind that. But I think... Just keep in mind that if a word for me, Bob Lassiter would never have been on the air in Tampa, would never have been on the air in Chicago, would never be sitting out there desperate and suicidal in Daven Port, Iowa? Probably would have just got on and had like a regular life. It's all true. He did mention your name quite often. Right. I'm not going to say what he said about you, but he's... Anyway, Bob, you know, I just tuned in and where are you these days? I live in Daven Port, Iowa, then here's in July, full 27. Are you on radio? Go. No, he's sitting on one during the call, but he's not as close as he yet. Oh, my God. You need to come back, Bob. Well, that's the purpose of our call to Bob today, is to get a start a white-in campaign and WSUN where Cox broadcasting pays the really big bucks instead of those awful replays and the tapes and all out of the crap, let's have Bob on there about 15 funny hours a day. I'm going to call to any, remember Danny's on her. What do you have, folks? I'm going to call him. I'm going to let everyone know to tune in right this minute. Do it. Do it. We want everybody to call Bob while he's on here, and he can feel that life is almost worth living. Naomi, you're a telephone number again, because a lot of people don't know it. And I have to search for it. Well, I've been searching for it for a long time. We'll have a great day. Thank you very much. Thank you, Bob. Bye, Bob. Bob, oh no, I'm not helping you. Say goodbye. Get lost. God, she opinion he asked. I'm pretty much, you've been saying nice things about me. That's why I'm in the community. Now listen, you don't want to have like a whole bunch of time where people just call and suck around, do you? Well, that's what you used to do all the time. Well, that's a point. Okay, we have an open line. I don't want people in fact I can't stand it. There's nothing more boring. That's the worst thing with talk shows is all these callers who want to ingratiate that I thought I taught you that. I want to ingratiate themselves with the host. Oh, you're such a breath of fresh air. Oh, I agree with everything you said. But what the hell are you calling for? Okay, it's boring. It is terminal, man. Okay, me. Hold on a minute, okay. Okay. But I want to make it with him. I keep trying. George has control and I don't like that at all. We have an open line at Broward. All you Bob Lasseter fans in Broward, there must be somebody. Of course, that I and Z what? Oh, look at that. We got Hialia for Bob. That's not Mary Lou, is it? Is this Mary Lou? Oh, hi, me. Oh, what do you want? Mary Lou. God, go away, Mary Lou. What's the wait? About three in gray, he ate the eggs. Oh. Yeah, have a nice day, Mary Lou. I'll talk to you another time. Me or? Yeah. I got a break. I got a break. Oh, go away, Mary. Bob, don't forget to tell me. I'm the one who got to start here. Oh, yeah. I'm doing a used to call here. Mary Lou, have a great day. Okay, say. Bye, Bob. Oh, God. He's bringing out everyone. It's like worms crawling out of my radio. Okay, put him on hold quickly for us as something else. It's 1123 on Newstalk Radio, 610 W. IOD. 1127 at W. IOD. Bob Lasseter is with us by phone. Oh, wait. There's something I want to clear up. This is, you're trying to get me a job. No, it's just a joke. Because the last time you got me a job in the old, I worked weekends. I had it to a five hour shift. And on top of that, whenever you through a night, I would have virtually no notice whatsoever when had to go in and do your four hour shift at night. But you want to tell people why it is that you didn't work through anymore because you said, snit on the air, but it didn't have an end in it. But anyway, that's another story for another day. Um, am I making that up? No, no, that's that's for that is true. Yes. We have an open line out of town by the way. And I should give that number because there are a lot of yahuabbi and Bob's people. 1-800-944-WIOD. 1-800-944-9463. Tampa. Hey, are you doing their deal? Okay. Bob, how you doing? This is Danny. Doing pretty good, Danny. Hey, have a long time, pal. Well, I haven't been in the market for a long time, Danny. Hello, you and Chicago. I left. I was, I over a year ago. You're an Iowa, no? Yep. Yep. Where is going fine? You know, Bob, TJ's right. Talk right here in Tampa, sucks. It bites. It doesn't it, Neil. It's been grooming it. It's suck. It, I mean, you know, that's why we came in there to save the dying. Oh, man, they got away from the court. Really? We got the guy at night who let me tell you Bob he's good. And I'm not going to give a save out. I think you know what you do. Why not? Well, can I? Sure. Well, Jay, Jay Marvin. Yeah. He's good. I like it. Like the life of the court. He's a leftist, you know? And, um, you know, like him. He's, he's selling out. Marcin in the morning. He's too much, he's too fmish. Oh, he's got talent. But the station's gone downhill to the left man. And, um, you know, it's just, uh, what can I say? It sucks. You got Stan Mangel, you're on at night. It's pretty good. But, uh, you know, station with six watts. Yeah, right. With six watts per channel, you dig. But, uh, just, you know, it's just, I'm not going to kiss your ass because you know that, uh, That's quite an assignment, sir. Yeah, he used to butt your Bob used to bust my balls, you know. And I love you. You know, I love to, man. What can I say, man? You know, I got, I'll leave you with this. November 22nd, 1963, the fastest to go over this country. Hey, man, sir. Here's a man on those which side it's buttered on. You got it, pal. They they killed Kennedy's a day. This damn country went under pal. Squeeze that passport, tides, sir. You got it, pal. Bob, take care. Take care, dad. Hey, dad. Danny, squeeze the tight. And he was banned. What? Why is that? Cronic? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. This is so much more fun than I ever believed it was going to be. You know what? Really? And his murder. Here's Sun City. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Hey, this is my second call. Why this is your correspondent from Sun City Center. Yes, sir. Sun City Center, excuse me. Where now is that? I told you, is, uh, uh, west of Wama and east of Runa. Oh, west of Wama and east of Runa. Oh, west of Wama and east of Runa. Oh, west of Wama and Baba, I want to inform you that we are monster in Wama. Okay. I mean, we are making inroads into the nooks and crannies of, uh, you're blowing a door off of Wama. We are blowing my mom's door. They're going to get our no doors in Wama's room. No problem there. Hello. Yes. We're still on. I know that's shocking. And you said hi to Bob. Yes. I would like to say hi, Bob. Hey, Bob. Hi, there. Oh, my, Bob. Hey, Bob. Just look at your dog. Uh, no, I do not. You know, when I moved to Chicago, so if you went to live with my wife, sister. Oh, bummer. Yeah. No, wasn't really so few of the very bad dog. We were really glad to get rid of her. Well, then I guess he took after his owner though, didn't he? Well, not really, but. But Sophie did not have fat on her eyelids, though. I will say that. This little joke, Bob. It's just a little joke. Hey, everybody has a trademark. Bob's trademark is those eyelids. Oh, that's true. Yes, they've dialed in the beard. I'm stunned. The old that you still remember. We haven't seen him. Why are you? Yeah, we did see each other. Are you now wait a minute when Chicago, you had the beard, right? Oh, yeah. I still haven't. I think that's what created the problem. They don't cotton of that too much in the Midwest. Actually, we need you. We need we need we need you and the new to work together here. There you go. Well, we need to get some good talk. If somebody on WSUN was alive for about 3,400,000 year over there, and really do something good. Yeah, we need to get some good talk right away. We got crap up here. Right. It's the boring. It's garbage. Terminal. TDS. But what about Lionel? Lionel was good for like the first three weeks, and he really sucks. Yeah. Everything I told him. It's great to local course, and you can't understand where he says it's pathetic. Dave still just a caller. He's great Lionel. He's the best. There's one decent show on over there from 10 o'clock to midnight now. It's a very dangler. Who? He's dangling it from 10 o'clock. Yeah, you wouldn't know about that, Neil. Yeah, I would. All right. Well, I got to go on my work. Okay. Have a great day. You're too. See you in my mama. Bye. Bye. Now what is that Velrico? Velrico. That's it. I can't believe it. I think you could be here for I may have to stick a thing in a minute. I hope so. Okay. I'm going to stick it while you talk to Bob. Hey, you're a Lionel from Delrico. What? You'll get a lot of calls from Delrico. What the hell is that? Yeah, the Rico Bob is still hanging out on the radio. He calls that Lionel and tries to make some sense. Remember, Velrico, cookie Bob? I sure do. Yeah. This is the meat and potatoes of West Coast Florida radio. Cookie Bob, Velrico Bob. What is that? What is that? We missed you down here and I'll tell you your Christmas story that you said that you used to do on the radio really touched me and let's see it back on the air down here. Maybe we can do some sort of a reverse, a simultaneous test with you over here on WSUN. Right. Pumped you out on the other coast. When and out, pump it out. That's it. Take a day to you guys. Thank you. Bob. See you. Velrico. Don't let me forget to stick a pin in that church. 1133, we have one of our... We have a lot of people. Really? More is that? Somewhere around there. Somewhere around there. And you wonder why he left that area. Okay. I know clue. North North East of... You're not fooling me. You're probably going to show remote from a Sarah Soda somewhere. Here's Miami Beach for Bob. Yeah, Bob. Yeah. When I was a girl, someone originally from Columbus, Ohio. Have you ever been around that area? Not for a long time, about 30 years. So when I was a young, I had BSI, I passed through Columbus. That was because I used to hear a voice, it sounded a much like yours. And he always said, you boy, you know, like an S-foot. That was Bob. That was last Columbia. That was last Columbia. Huh? I never worked Columbus. You wanted it? Listen, there are a lot of markets where Bob never worked, but that sound, that's... You got it, baby. There it is. You got it. It just emnates from radios from transmitters from coast to coast. All right. I was just curious about that. Okay. All right, thanks. Have a great life. Are you Tissier? Boy. Open line on the star line if you have Bells on the ability. It's star IOD. Here's, uh, Saint-Pweet. No, I know. How you doing? As when to say I'd a Bob. How you doing? Good. All right. Have you considered coming back to the series? I like considered it. We thought about, uh, when we fell off in Chicago, we did consider moving back to Tampa and, uh, I still don't want to these days. I enjoyed it. Oh, Neil shows good now, but, you know, they need some. Don't listen. Don't suck around that heavily, sir. Don't don't use my show to say Neil show is good, but. Do you or the greatest, but don't do that. It was even here. Don't put on issue in though. They need one. They do need a very good host on issue in though. What does that mean? They think they need a very good host over and over. Well, no, there's no question about that. But you think that those cheap bastards and Cox are going to spend money to bring in a like a live person. If you knew how much they're paying us to carry. In fact, I should have told Bob this last night, which he would just puke all over himself. Next to nothing, I couldn't buy my dog's dog food with him. Well, we're giving them this for practically for free, because they're basically incompetent in at that a bunch of geeks. Well, they what if they put Bob on their teeth or eating shoot up. They'd have a 50 share if they put his fat ass on that state tonight. If they put the rest of money, they'd have an 80 share. The best that I got to go back to work night. 6 to 10. Well, the best one I ever told Bob did a live remote from the same Pete shuffleboard court. Oh, my God. Yeah. Just after he got last year's Lincoln and he drove it over there. And he did his live remote from over there. And the people wouldn't come out and talk to him. They just still didn't look over anything. He was supposed to go like, wouldn't let us on the proper. Yeah. He went out and got a go out and buy a bowl of corn. And so there's this guy walking that street and Bob ran after this guy and took off down the road and caught him down there near the end of the road. He just kind of shrugged him off and kept going. I was the best for a live remote I ever saw in my life. I totally forgot. It was the best one I ever saw. Well, Bob, I have a going. Take care. Have a great life. Okay. See, we had called up the shuffleboard court and St. Petersburg. And asked if we'd kind of do it remotely. And they were really real. And they said, yes, and we put it in phone lines and I hope that. And then the day before they found out who I was and they banned this from the property. You mean you were over there picking on the old farts? Well, yeah. Where did you learn that? We're living in one of the things. Come on. Great. We're living. All right. Hold on. Because I know you got a busy schedule, but we're going to milk everything we can out of this. Oh, I hope so. Because when you see all the call that are pouring in from you here, man, it's going to like it's going to make you want to get on the first greyhound bus. 1137, a news talk radio, 610, WIOD. See one. Okay. I asked you to do the question, George. Is Bob on? Hello? How can he be on when you're in here sticking pins in your thing? What a geek. He's dead. This is the new thing. George finally got turned out of the job. He likes sticking pins in it. He's looking for a son city center and he's just a maniac. You're there, Bob, right? I'm here now. Standing to the miracle of modern technology since George got his ass back into the control and punched it up. We never got to the thing about so you got cannon Chicago in WLS because of what? Uh, I don't know. Because I didn't sit in. You didn't fit in because you were a trouble maker and you wanted to do some real whatever it was and they didn't like it because they don't want you do anything. I didn't want to do anything anymore. I just didn't fit in. Didn't fit in. Okay. And then called around in Tampa had a desire to come back to the market where he was once King or Prince or Princess and they said from J. Corps they said we'd love to have you back Bob and then you started talking money. Well, um, that was about a year and a half ago. The last time I talked with him, they suggested I get in touch with WTK and it made me a lot of money. Well, I think you ought to talk to Bob Hundley over WSU and talk money when you hear that dial tone on the other end of the phone real quick. You'll be able to relate to it. Okay. Let's take a look. I asked for much of the old I was making 51 cents a call. You can say slime ball. How about having I OD? I will cast S.I.W.N with Bob and I. You can go the other way. Now you're talking. Yeah. We have complete run down. That would take a long time. I think I'm going to do it. I think I'm going to do it. I think I'm going to do it. I think I'm going to do it. I think I'm going to do it. Now you're talking. Yeah. We'll take care of that because I give me an end to six o'clock in night the station sort of fade away. Uh-huh. Yeah. So what do you think? Is this like for real if people start rattling cages are you serious? And I it's hard to tell you. You're going to weigh your kid in way and not only you're probably very relaxed out there right now. So the email cage is like, what? You're talking to a state of Florida right now. I guess Neil told you between I OD and S.I.W.N. They've taken over the world. Well, I'll be real. I just want to do it for him. I'll be really honest with you. I have no particular great interest in going back in to talk if I can survive outside of it. I this last night when Bob called me at home it was one of the most rational conversations I have ever had with anybody in the business in my life. He said, if I never do talk radio again, I'll be the happiest man on the face of the earth. You know, I miss an alony. I miss the money bad money. Don't miss the does it miss coming in and talking to geeks and it's like when I talk, you know, I play the Canadian lottery all the time. I send away about 7,800 bucks a year and I get part of it back here and every Sunday morning. I just lie there and bed waiting for the phone to ring from Vancouver with the exciting news. Okay. I wouldn't. I used to say I'd come in and do one last show. I wouldn't even do that. All these people say, oh boy, don't you miss it. Don't you, what are they talking about? Miss what? I know. You know, every morning you've got to go to the car about something. Wait. No, I don't have to get up and care about anything. You, are you working out there? You look some of your retired or you're doing some. I'm trading futures. Trade for my own account. I don't have to be here right now. Looking at the screen. Oh. Bob is doing slop futures out there today, man. He's doing it. Well, listen. Good evening, boys. I have a great life. Okay. 1145 at WI would do. We have two open lines. Both of course in Broward see the problem with Broward and Bob is at Broward. Bob used to be on the INC. Well, that's right. But you were on a weekend. I was going to say at night. I was on a night. Right. You were on a night. And I would be here for Broward. We used to have like eight and nine shares in Broward. And nobody could hear us, which was incredible. Here's Tampa for Bob. Hey. Don't. Don't pretty good. There's good to hear Bob's voice again. Although, don't you remember, says, I remember about him is his very, sarcastic, you know, always a tone of somebody's ass. Right. That's what we like. Sir, we like a spina in your side. We kind of miss him out here. You know, maybe you can pick up the flat for Ted wet there on the road. Ted wet there on that WFLA in the morning. Who is this guy? He's Ted wet. Yeah. Ted wet is like, who's the worst? He's the worst. No, now he's a newscaster. He's no longer a sportscaster out for the station. Oh, he's dirty. He's terrible. I just talked to Ted. He's a wether he nights ago. He didn't tell me that. I thought he was still doing sports. He's terrible. He only works at guard around the morning or whatever. He's the worst. Now, Lionel, you know, Lionel's pretty good. Again, that's that attorney that was talking about. Yeah. Yeah. I was a good voice. And how about that from Sun City Center? Have time to get on the phone. He should be playing shuffleboard out there in Sun City Center. It's a retirement. No, no, it's died. The big tournament starts at noon today. The big shuffle off. Yeah. Well, the clock. They got the ping pong tournament at the Sun Coast. Don't let it run the session in two. And don't forget, Bingo. Bob missed all the big controversy when he's been out of state. Yeah. Bingo. What's going on? Think of. Oh, they shut the laws. They ran out on Bingo. And man, I'm telling you the old farce here started rattling their spears. They don't give a crap if they close up all the schools. They're all highways. If they cut off everybody's education, whatever my people. But we're single on the Indian reservations. Bingo. All of it was shut down for a few days. And the old farce went crazy. They were shaking their teeth in a glass. And they were like, spirit and governor was going to use it. We're throwing some bingo. Bob, good to hear from you. And Neil, tell my urban Cuban cousins down there. Miami, I said hello. Okay. All right. Adios. I'll read the urge. I wouldn't let them back on again. Okay. We have an open line in Broward. We start line if you have Bellsauqua, ability, star IoT. We're talking to the world famous Bob Lassiter who was a voice in the wilderness here in South Florida. And that was like a major monster star in Tampa, St. Pete for two years on WFLA when the station was going to go for four years, two years or so. Let me say again, for four years, it seemed like go only two because it went by so fast for Bob. But for four years on WFLA with enormous. No, two years on WFLA. Two years on WFLA and four years in WLS. Uh-huh. In Tampa. What other station were you on in Tampa? Uh, WPLP. You were on the big plop? Yep. Are you? I don't remember that. Sure. Was that what I told? That's right. Oh, yeah. That's after you said the S word on INZ. Right. I was working with it. Then you went over to the big plop, which was the again at station at that time. No, I was working both. I was working money through Friday on plop and then weekends on INZ. And then you said crap on INZ. You were the one to tell me to take the gig at a clock because they offered me 12 grand a year. Let me say it again. You see, if I wouldn't have to not that I want to take credit because I always get blamed for other people's failures like the PUTREJOY Reynolds who's filling in on QAM in a morning and it's embarrassing. I always get blamed for other people's failures. Nobody ever gets gives me credit for putting them on a map. And if you hadn't taken my advice and been on the PLP, you never would have wound up on FLA. In fact, you told me take the gig at PLP. You are not going to do it five days a week. We are only working weekends. Well, I'll be expecting the check in a mail. Okay, hold on Bob, don't go away and I got a busy schedule. 148 at News Talk Radio 610 WIOD. 152 at WIOD. Are you going to, what should we do another hour? What? What? Are you talking to me? No, I'm talking to George. Of course, I'm talking to you. Why are you so insecure, Bob? Oh, look at this. You're ready. You're ready. Got me. Oh, man. This is a man who graduated acting 102 at some like a funky school and new college in Sarasota. Here's Poppo to Bob. Bob, yeah. Hey, I can see why you're not on the air anymore because you are boring. Okay, well listen, have a great life. That's where you're going to get. Relax, that's the kid that calls in every day, 600 times. And you're getting emotional about him. He's a cranky and you're getting emotional about him. I can start up my career at GPS. I got that we call up in the middle of guests. And I kind of stopped and me talk with an Indian accent. And then he starts to say, you're boring. I don't know. I don't. And they wonder why you don't see what really it cracks me up is because I knew this is what was going to happen. Oh, Bob, we're going to take up a petition drive. And here the guys having a good time. He's mining his own business and he's hoping to make a few bucks. And doesn't want the stress in the pressure or the grief. It would like to live past the age of 40. No, no, no. What do the petitions make all I just, you know. You know. Tampa for Bob last. You know, Tampa for Bob last. It's not going to dignify that groveling remark with a response. Tampa. Hey, Bob. Hey. This is Joe. Joe, I do. It's to be an Odessa. I'm Joe. I'm Odessa. Right. What the devil. I remember we only miss you. I know this isn't good. Are we on national radio now? Yeah, we're on coast to coast. Oh, boy. Everybody will love this conversation. Right. Well, listen. We all miss you. We're on the road to Sebastian. Remember Bob your theory was always the best talk radio is when there's good talk radio for competition. Side there's run here in Tampa. There is no competition. I think we've got to feel that. All right. By the way, who? Mr. Airstream. Mr. Airstream died. I think. Oh, yeah. We don't hear him no more. But anyway, we really love you, mission. And we'd like to see you come on back and give this line. I'll big shot some competition here. Okay. And you take care and come up. I said hello. Thank you, Joe. Bye bye. Bye bye. 1154. WOD. We have a lot of line out of town. All these people that are living in the past. Even Bob knows that that topical boring ponderous weeklong a boring, you know, it's abortion for three days Wednesday through Friday. And it's the death penalty Monday through Tuesday and, uh, uh, uh, give it a rest. Nobody cares. Nobody wants it except the, uh, 60. The juror tall plus said, okay. God. Penelas Park. Bob. Yeah. I do have money. Okay. Well, um, we left. You put a lot of business, you know that? Like a decent delay, eh? Right here? Yeah. I think he played man. He was a trip, wasn't he? Yeah, I see sure was. Do you feel like you're preparing for the ice cream? Of course. Oh man. Well, you can just... If you say, well, sir, if you say, oh man, one more time. You win the decency later. Go, both can asleep with the fishes. The decent delay, he was a trip. Yeah. Now, you already said that. Oh, no man. How's Mary? Mary's don't grate the dog? Uh, well, I... Dogs gone, sir. We already heard about this. Okay. We don't want any more of this personal little trivia. Okay. Let's talk about the greater expanding universe. The greater expanding universe. Right. Like the next call. Let's go to a homo salsa. Hey, Bob. Hey. How you doing, Larry? How much faster? Pretty good, Larry. Uh, do you believe in thermal limits? Do I believe in what? What do you say? What do you believe in thermal limits? Chacha, chacha, chama, chama, netch. What's the funny? I think that's the... That's could... This could be the funniest call of the century. I don't think about thermal limits anymore. Oh. In other words, he doesn't give a flying crap as what he's tried to say in a very nice polite Waser. Well, that might be why you're not working. I might be. It probably is. If you would think a lot more about term limits, Bob. You'd probably be on W ABC right now, doing morning drive. But in other capsities, every press of station. You're probably right. Isn't Steve's came there anymore? Give me a break. Steve came as on a six-watt station that you can only pick up. If you stick your finger with your transmitter. Yeah. Hey, Bob. I'm just teasing. We miss you, man. Thank you. Okay. Come on back. Okay. Bob, y'all come back now. That was from Homo, Sessa. We have an open line on the out of town line. If you want to speak to Bob Lassard, he'll be with us till 1 o'clock Eastern daylight time. So, get online, man. Because they're just lined up. The phones are kind of weak. What? In the fact, this is like the old Mike Spindel thing in reverse. What? I'm not going to be a book. I'm going to be a book. No, what I used to do is that when the phones would be slow and Spindel was in a building, I'd invite him to come in. I'd threaten to bring him in for just, and he would say, like, two words. And I'd say, okay, if you don't call, I'm going to have Spindel on for this entire hour. And the phones would immediately go crazy. Oh, you had some great tricks to get called. I'm surprised that Larry records remember that. Yeah, I sure wish I had him now. I wish Spindel would call. I'm surprised he hasn't. Because he's one of those people that was always groubling at your feet. He was kind of like a Bob Lasseter. You know how when you look at him. You know how when you look at him. You know how when you look at him. When you look at him, the past you're out there in Davenport at the cows and they have those white birds that kind of like hang out and they like pecked the insects off their bodies. What? Huh? The cattle he grips. Right. Exactly. That's what Mike Spindel was like the cattle e-grid of software to radio on your body. Well, no, that was the only thing I knew you. Is that it? Yeah. Miami. Hello. Hey, guys. Yes, sir. How are you? Great. We made a cattle call. We got him. When are we going to get dick fatherly on? That'll be next week. That'll be. Yeah. God, I haven't heard this guy in five years. Yeah. At least. How the hell have you survived? Well, you know, there was always Steve Canne. Just kidding. Just kidding. So how are you? I'm going to find him. Can I hear it? Can you hear it? Can you hear it? Can you hear it? What car? Oh, he got. No, no, no. You know the one, uh, what car? Oh, God. The one that uh. Yeah. I'm good. It's on a loop. I can't pick and choose what he's going to say. It's on a loop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can I have a, oh, you're all for walk at Georgia? I can't out of here. Love him 58 at WIO Day. We have an open line out of town. If you're real quick, if you want to speak to the, uh, you need. Guy, I haven't heard that phrase since I left Miami. What phrase? If you're real quick. Yeah. I do that just because he mentioned somebody's name only moments ago. I used to sit with eight empty lines and say, well, we have lot of opening it. If you move quickly, 1-800-944-WIO Day, if you want to speak to the Messiah of Tampa, who's got the holes in his hands to prove it, here's Loots. Yeah, Bob Lester. Hey, you're doing lots. Well, I can't hear your, uh, your voice anymore here. No, I'm not on the air there anymore. That's why. I'd like to find out about, uh, your desktop, your views are deaf. No, they have no, no, no, no. You're all in favor of the death penalty for chronic collars. Right, killer right now. All right, listen, hold on a inch. We call Bob back. Now, I'll leave him on hold that'll run the bill up. Some more. Okay, I want to piss off the sisters. Okay, there's so cheap man. It's frightening. We only got $5 billion. Can we put in a few lines on the internet? Oh, no, that's got to cost him money. And as you went, won't spring for it. And we don't want to have to pay out any money, okay? It's, uh, your laughing. It sits frightening. It really is. Okay, like I said, in Tom Jick is column this morning. There are two ways to do everything the right way. And the Cox broadcasting way. Hold on, Bob. Okay. Don't go out and do any futures now. All right, listen, we're going to come back with a little more hours. Bob Lanceter, which quite frankly, we almost never have guessed on his show. But it's like, it's like a breath of fresh air, isn't it? Or it's like just a big deep, gigantic breath. Yeah. Right. Okay, don't forget Rick and suds this afternoon who are doing in the wake of yesterday's incredible First out of town, uh, pay phone challenge, are doing, uh, some crap today. Follow five. That's big and he bore city. By the way, we have two open lines. They're both in Broward again. Broward is like stink of this week. You know what I say? They're all out of town. 5 2 4 9 4 6 3. Either that or last that are scared of him away. We're talking to the once very famous Bob Lanceter who's now like, shrinking into oblivion in Davenport, Iowa. But came back to a be, uh, coddled by his fans to be Lord and, uh, Cajold and, uh, tinkled on. Right? Bob. We're going to open lines. We don't have a full board. Let's go. What a secret for Bob. Hello. Good morning. Neil and Bob. Good afternoon sir. I tell you this is a radio accident to talk to two. Two. That y'all. Who said this is a radio accident. Two fat guys like us. I'm telling you this is a fat guy. Top of the two fat guy. Well, that's great. Anyway, long time ago, I was a stir up trouble, but I was listening to Bob Blaster. Yeah. And he was given Neil and Berg Hill. I believe it. And he was talking about nasty things. And then you went to go and on between Neil and Berg. Really? Yes. Bob knows I have much better taste than that, believe me. But I just wanted to confront Bob with it. See what he had to say about it. He brought me to remember who's the bird. That's me. By the way, you'll be excited. No Bob that the bird who has been banished to Lakeland does call us. Facti call yesterday. Who's the bird? He calls us what Glenn Hill, the bird. The old Glenn Hill. Yeah. Did you say you're on G2? Bob also has Alzheimer's by the way, sir. The bird calls us once a week. He's our Lakeland correspondent now. So he's basically involved in radio as you are, like by long distance on the phone for free. Well, I'll be you, C-bring course. G2 transpired. We got a bunch of folks in C-bring. We got like a whole bunch of pins stuck in that. Well, I know you need pins stuck in John meter. Yeah. He's got several stuck in here. G2, what? G2, three. Okay. Two or three. John have a lovely day. And y'all too. See y'all come back. My bye. Why do they say that? Why do they talk that way, is there like some special reason? I don't know. You haven't had any calls yet from a century city. From what? Cemetery city? Or cemetery village? Well, here's as close as we get to Cemetery's. Here's St. Pete that's close enough. St. Peter's bird. Yes, sir. I wanted to say hello to Bob Lathar. Well, that's it. You consider it done? Hey, Bob, you know, I used to listen to you all the time. I didn't call in, but, uh, one of the free loaders. Yeah, I'm a free loader. What can I say? You know, I was laid off from a job and I've been free loading even a while. I've got to drop my knees and literally beg for calls. I know. I know. Bob, you know, I just tuned in about 20 minutes ago and heard you on. I thought I had to call. Just wanted to say that as everyone else I've heard, it said, we really could use you down here. You can trade future. Look at Louis. Let me say something. Yeah. I mean, it's always nice to have people tinkle all over. And all we watch you to come back and all the other instance here, Crap. But, but, I mean, isn't it possible to have just a little verbal dialogue without all this, with this sucking around this heavy. I mean, the suction is so great that the inversion layer is going to cane the goddamn walls in a minute. Wait a minute. You're not going to listen to people tinkle to all my shoes. If the man wants to take a letting tinkle in a minute. Bob, I'll just enjoy this. Are you jealous, Neil? Not in the least. You're jealous. You're jealous. Wait, I mean, takes my calls is what I'm going to employ. I don't like tinkling. Sir, are we going to? Well, you know, okay. I like taking a shower alone. You know what I'm saying? We won't talk about that. How about something? I'll say Bob, do you think that Neil Rodgers show could use a blessing from Master Daniel? I think it would be a definite improvement. Yes. Do you? Would you like me to play it? Sure. Do you mind Neil? What is that? Well, the quality has been good. But once Bob... The answer is no chance. Have a great day, sir. When we get that desperate that we have to hear food in the back. Okay. We already have to do the evening's all the phones. Yeah, we already got there. We got Linda Leris spinning her head around up front because there's no lunch today. We have an open line out of town, 1-800-944-Wild. We have two open lines at Broward still. I don't understand that. I mean, I understand that hate me like poison and broward because I live there. But here's the guy who's down and out of work who wants to be tinkled on and loved and cajoled and fondled. And a Broward, I think something's wrong with those broward lines. Sure, I want to go on record again, a saying it because we know that there's been people tinkling with our phone lines. Well, it doesn't spend dollar and broward. Right. I might slice it and broward. Yeah. You're supposed to go to with anything. Put around in front of the list. 5-2-4-Wild-D and broward. There's something wrong on those lines. W-I-O-D. Fine, checker. Okay. W-I-O-D. 5-2-4-D. Hello. See, they're not even lighten up there and brow. There's something screwed with our broward lines, man. God, is there something going on with this company? This is the dumbest bunch of people on the face of the earth. Here at W-I-O-D. Cox broadcasting is like the radio station from Hell. You're going to blame those two sweet little old ladies because you can't buy a call from Broward. Palm Beach. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yeah. This is there. You know, I'm done. I'm home each. Yes, sir. I just call it, tell you, you guys doing a great job. And you all make my day. My friend Mike and her de-smeatier show. Great. It's been awesome, man. I just like, thank you. Well, have a great life, Eric. All right. You too, man. Good luck, Bob. Thank you. All right. Where are your regular callers? You all know what he's called in? We don't have regular callers. They're very loose. Hi, Alia. We don't encourage regular callers. That's one of the reasons you're not on the air anymore. It's the kiss of death. All these people who identified by a name, we have like maybe two or three. We have the Nazi landing lady who calls when she's asked to call because we've got her well trained. Okay. And we got Paul Harvey Jr. Who's been banished to hell up there in Boko, where would it help he is? Because he's a pain in a carrot eating pain in the ass. Does it sound like calling anymore? Say, oh, give me a break. All those people are on the light bulb. Those old GBS weekend I O-I and Z people to say, oh Bob. Oh, you used to listen to them? No, I did not. Sure he did. I can hear their voices on the light bulb on the six-watt station over there with Alice Red Tell and Mr. Ego. Oh, you got to forget about that. That kind of radio is dead. Dead meat. 150 plus Methuselodemographics. Okay. Oh, I'm Bob. Give him a little seminar where you're during a break. Problem at the afternoon at News Talk Radio 610 W-I-O-D.

And you may must be able to play your show six times a day. Oh, I could lie about the guy. And nobody really knew whether or not I had a dog. True. True. Well, I have two dogs and I'm proud of it. How do you like that? Do you know the little one does occasionally do a dump on the floor when the grass is so high that it can't squat in the backyard. And if Sal doesn't cut my lawn that I'm going to rip him for four hours tomorrow, go head sir. I always create my talk show host by how many dogs they have. Right. I won't. You'll never had dogs right now. I know that's why I'm back up in a world. There's never a part of you. It's kind of guy that would have dogs. I've been with plenty of dogs. Believe me. Well, I know that. But I can't get a word in here. Well, I would. I would hope so. Tough competition. Anyway, Neil. I really appreciate your show. I've got to especially appreciate your bringing on the guests and just like to say, I hope so. I'll be up here for getting Bob back in the area. Uh, at some addition drives are petition rights.

What is this one of your callers, Bob? I don't remember. When you jumped up to it, Chicago, I tried to call there. They wouldn't put me into you. I can't imagine one. I call long distance. Never to let. And key. And we were glad. Why say we're wife and I. Yeah. Let's think it for the pop-grunt. And we'd love to see you come back here and do all the radio buddy. And now, never forget the day that. Six Norman got the gas. And you. Tell me eight. Well, you had a revision too. Because he did not really leave you a threat. You were a threat clocked me afternoon. And secondly. And no. Wait a minute. I thought the Norman was dead. What about the day that he died? They wouldn't tell me that they'd play no for hours. And Bob was on your belly again. He didn't come in to relieve him. And the guy was dead. Yes. That our heartless, cool up, not just bastards. I just know he was dead. He'd be dying, W. And Bob. Not even Bob. Yes sir. And thank you for coming. Sir, I hope you spell C.R. You know what? And so, Faber of 88. A safety time. You're going to pick on it. Go on. You have your photograph.

You know you wrote on the wall. I'm still utility. You're funny. I love you. You're the lead. We love you. Yeah. Come on back. Okay. He's doing it. He's hopping on the house right after this call. He's on his way. He's got a commute. Just like he used to do for my. Hey, Bob. Yes sir. Got the West. Okay. Bob bless you, Tusser. Bob bless us all as Tidy Tim said. Boy, that view changed. What? Boy, you can't. Now you're telling people God bless. What? You can't. Oh. Hey, listen, he needs help from somewhere. Believe me. So now the truth comes out. All these gigantic numbers that last. It used to have in Tampa. And now we're getting the sound of all of those. Good young voices, man. Woo. They're great calls. They are the best. I love them. I love them. Here's Tampa. Hey, you're. How you doing? Good. Good. In the. I want to thank you for having. Bob. And I enjoy your shot. Just been turned out to it this week. Yeah. I got to tell you. I'm a little bit more grateful in the area who just been turned on recently for the first time. Yeah. Listen, I'm not that you did a big board when you left the area. And the thing I think I'm this one of the. I enjoyed. Was. Yeah. Double. Well, the show that you. You're off the wall one. Like the times you've got your audience bring your chairs in on body after noon. Yep. And the couple shows you did I believe in people home. You know, God. Yes. How much it earned your living room. Oh, I regret it. Who wasn't eating on the air during those. Was he sir with that? Did he stick man? I don't know. He was the eating on the year. Oh, that's your stick. Okay. You called I'm called serious. Right. Exactly there you go. That was the problem at WLS. The management up there was try too were stuff that went out with Nickrose casi i've left up an Chicago. God. Well, your. What a. I turned Bob on and I said to my girlfriend the time I said something they've taken something's wrong with Bob. They have taken the Colonies out of Bob last year. That's not a little bit of a problem too though in Chicago. The audience didn't know how to play along. The audience in Tampa did. Oh, there's no fear of the call. Well, wait a minute. Are you saying to me that the audience in Chicago was stiffer than the audience in Tampa? Oh, God. Much stiffer than the call. Oh, God. I mean, all of these people that were talking about. No wonder there are so many Cub fans. Is there too stupid to be upset? Now I understand what it's all about. But all of these colleagues that we're talking about from the old days in Tampa, these aren't my contrivences. These were just mere mortals who made up characters and called in and didn't do it too often. It was great. Really, I'm not sure they didn't do it too often. Believe me, the way they sound. I can buy that. So we knew about it. It's coming from. We like to play along. I can print this show. Walk around the state fair with a bull horn. I mean, you knew darn well was tongue and cheek. But I used to have the people used to calm up and would take Bob there. If you knew, don't know. I'm taking notes on someone's name. I got to get, I get to get out of something. Oh. Well, we're done. We're done. We're all talking. Okay, have a great day. Bye. Bye. Boy, this is like a revelation that they speak in a religion. Okay, hold on Bob now. Listen, don't go take it all. But don't do religion. If you get call waiting, don't stop all those jobs that are pouring in. Just relax. Okay, just remember what side your bread is a buttered on. Can we get work out of this? 1223. First talk radio 610 WIOD. Add Bob's favorite tune-o-dough. Club 27 at WIOD. Oh, I'm making notes here. That's true. Two open lines of the drower. Howard hits you almost as much as they hate me. They're just indifferent and broad. Too many goiam and broad. Now, 524 WIOD and one out of town line just dropped off during the long pond risk break. 800-944 WIOD, kind of a week performance. Here's a lady from Carpenter, Topping Springs. Hi there. Hi. Hey Bob, what a voice you have. Well, thank you. Nothing like a sensuous camper we have to really go on downhill. I've always said, anybody with a voice that deep, it must really hurt to sit down. I can remember having a real hard time dieting because of him. I've tried to use to bring him this wonderful food. Cheesecake. Oh, you got to be kidding. Where did he steal that? I don't know, but they brought it to him and then he described it over to Eric. Yeah. Make your mouth water. It was terrible. Every time I be doing real good on a diet, I had to go get a piece of cheesecake. Yeah. Well, the bunch that once you're twice said that happened. Oh, listen to that. Oh, a lot. A lot of time. It was wonderful. And we really miss you. And believe me, if there's any petitions around here, I'll be signing up. I will. I'll be down to the public side. I have to go to public. You'll be standing out front there with free, uh, tap at tribunins and Saint Pete times and petitions and whatever else you can battle. Great. Great. Nice hearing your voice again. How to grade day. Bye bye. We'll be on my range all in blue too. 12. 29. No, at the Crystal and Lute. That's really good stuff happens every night. Open line out of town. If you want to talk to good old Bob Lassidy, 18944Wild and two in Broward, what happened to all year old? I know what it is. They hate me like poison. I saw you had her, I in Z on the weekend. I'll never forget as long as I live and it really pissed me off. I think of all the things that have ever happened. This could have been one of the all-time worst. It was on a Saturday and as usual, I had those gigantic numbers, but that didn't mean they wanted to talk to me, especially the old farts who hated me like poison already. That was when I was doing, I think I was doing mid days already and I was doing week a Saturday, 10 to 2 and you were doing 2 to 6. Whatever it was. And I had gotten through 4 hours of unusually, I mean really begging and pleading and they didn't want to play the game and they didn't want to call and they were can't tank or some crappy. And Bob goes in at a little production studio and he carts up the stupid contripes. Oh my god, the sky is falling, the sky is falling. Oh my god, what are we going to do? And it was on cart. Okay. It was on a tape. And he went through this like 90 second monologue on a tape. And he didn't say anything all by just a real negative, depressing psychotic. And I was in the studio and he played this at the beginning of a show after CBS News. And those lines exploded like Jesus himself had come back and offered everybody something, you know like good cheap olive oil. I couldn't believe it. It was so depressing and disgusting. And of course, air-ve voice was older than the next. Oh, you're so right Bob, things are really bad. Well, who was that guy that used to drive over from Naples or from John McEugh? Who I can hear? I can hear you that that radio drifting the genera who's the king of the flea markets over there and four mires now. You know what he does? He's on some, he's on some Yahoo station and four mires which by the way were booming in there as we speak. We've had some calls from over there. And I know he listens because he got no life. He's the guy used to bring his wife. Remember he used to drive it on a weekend. Bring his wife. He used to sleep in the trunk of his car in a parking lot. I mean, talk about dead beats. And he's, he is trades out time on some, brokers time with some crappy station in four mires and does this thing from the flea market every weekend. He tapes all these ridiculous. Oh, we're over at yellow number 62 now. Now what do you guys do for a living on here? What are you selling? Oh, this is real interesting. Oh, don't look at it. You're the proof. Just unbelievable. I mean, and any fancies himself is like, you know something about the business. John, what you know about the business, I could stick up your button and have room for the Chinese army left over. Okay. I remember that trouble getting called from Broward. No, he didn't because he used to put all the computer cranks on here. That was his whole show. Here's a mobile in the market. Stay in Iowa. You suck last year. Okay, another fan club for the Bob Lasseter show. Well, we got to get a few of those on. That was one of the younger demographics that you claimed to have had. Here's a lady in St. Pete. Hi, man. Yes. Now first time quality show. Great. Uh, they show your denote of whimp and you're not insecure having them on the show. Well, Bob is a tremendous threat to me. Well, you might have used to. You don't understand the only time Neil talks to me or permits me on his show is what I'm down and out. Right. Like when I had you on at work, he's a little bit of a pleasure when you were at WLS in Chicago. Oh, he's not in W. When you were up there in a big city, making a big box about half of what I made. I mean, you're a meal at the post of the WM, and WFLA who I'm put on the monitor the guest. Yeah. I hate Bob. This is Rose. Rose, how are you? Good. Now, Bob, it's mid. It was my one of your best and our favorite colors. You certainly were. That's it all. Hey, Bob, I'd love to have you back. I'm going to call it WLS. You win. I got some dumb guys on. Rick and serve to some. You're not good. Hey, Neil, it's really runs at night. But it's too spot there. Rose, I honestly don't think it's called to the station. It's going to do it. Would you have to do it? Get your friends together from the church. That's a good question. That's a good question. No, no. Good. How do I do it? I call that seven-watt station. Tell them they had to put you on. You said you want too much money or something. Yeah. Hey, Bob, I bet you didn't get rid of you in Chicago because the bunch of Republican fascists and management. Yeah, that's right. How did you know, Rose? Yeah, I'm smart. Anyway, we're missing Bob. I'm not a lawyer. Thank you, Rose. Bye. Thanks, Rose. Bob, bye. That was Rose just in case you missed. What happened? Two open lines had brought, five, two, four, Wild, Bob, Lassitors. He's just dying to talk to you or just plain dying. Here's Miami Lakes. Hey, Bob, how you doing? Don't pretty good. Neil, you're not too bad. You still, have you been to the pot lately? Have I been to the pot before I came to work? No, I haven't heard any spots for the pot lately. They're on and off. Well, what does that mean? Well, the melting pot. Well, what does that have to do with the price of peanuts in Davenport, Iowa? I don't get it. It's corn corn, Neil. Well, it's a good corn here. Just wanted to say, I haven't heard anything lately. And I've got a buddy of mine who does the maintenance pot. And I was wondering if you're going to do any spots for them. The meatlin pot? Yeah. It could be. The pot in Maylin. The pot in Maylin. That's where most people who live their spend their time, I understand. Well, what the hell did I owe anyways? But a bunch of corn and that girl's. Well, yeah. Oh, uh, the nutmache. The nutmache. The cheap one of here. You know, I'm not working now. Bob was in search of a place where was real cheap to live. And he could take the $500 that he had saved up from all his years in radio. And stretch it out as far as he could. And he found it. I'm loving. I've enjoyed your show. I haven't had much opportunity to hear you before. But um, get into it now. Can I call someone to do something? Of course. I like to call, uh, Dale Wallace and, uh, Robert Brady, a bunch of cheese, chocolate dipping douche bags. OK, don't get carried away now. All right. Have a great day. OK, uh, 1235 put the last hit or back on hold before he says something a dangerous again. We have an open line in date at 751. We have one out of town at 1-800-944-Wild. And Howard continues absolutely indifferent. We could put, uh, Mike Alangelo, the Pope and, uh, president, Roosevelt on the phone here with them. And it still wouldn't make a damn bit of difference. And Howard at 524Wild. And like I said, if we would have had any smarts at all, we would have eliminated all three of them. They listen. We've got a gigantic audience in Howard. They don't talk. They don't want to speak to us. We have no problem with that. Put on some more out of town lines where the Broward lines used to be. Went and doubt flush those babies out. Trust me. Well, 35 at Newstalk Radio, 610 Wiod. And because Newstalk. Oh, we go. 1239, 21 to 1 Bob. See, I didn't think you put them back on you too busy. How could I try to connect your George? You're too busy talking with that cheap engineer. We have an open line on the Sterlin, Ster iodine, and Broward Bob is just, uh, they don't like you in Broward. Well, I've never did. Here's a mobile in Venus. Hey, or is this Uranus? No, if Uranus, I don't know where that's that. Venus. What the hell is that? Well, if it's out to nowhere, I'm south to see bring. There's a place called Venus. Yeah, Venus. Rimes with Venus. Venus. Where do you start getting calls from? Fruit City. We go, we fish. We are waiting at the end of those, believe me. The city had been the same, but we, when I moved to see bring, we'd have to drive to watch you, Chula, to listen to you on W. On 970 over there. And we had to go to more haven, to listen to Neil. Now we're blessed. Yeah, you are blessed. Well, just have Bob on every week for free. We'll just pay for the phone call. We'll have Monnehill just make a lot of like, um, Monnehill. You'll feel it home again. I'm a travel traveler. Pete sales, but Neil answered this question for me. Go ahead. I'm leaving a plant city yesterday from Land of Lakes. Yeah. I'm on I4 and are the record pulling the WSU and Bronco with country classics on it. He's a plant city. Where was it going? Where was it going to Uranus? I already told you. To the ends of the universe. Well, anyway, evidently they heard the music, believe me. Well, I'm at it. Well, it's parked somewhere as a watermelon, sand and lakeland. Great. Well, Tom, to pick this. Sir. Have a great day. Thank you. Okay, boy, you talk about running out quick, man. Like somebody just pulled a plug on that baby. Here is a lady in St. Pete. Hello, Neil. Hi. I'd like to see how low to Bob first. I'm sure, like, St. Pete. I haven't talked to anybody on the radio since you left. Surely how you doing? All going right. You're doing. I'm so proud of you. You're still involved in that terrible, love affair thing. No, no. Good. No, I'll wait till you get back. Okay. Okay. That'd be awful, man. I just happened to hear you. I'll switch over. Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute, Charlie. What does that mean? You just happened to hear him. What is it? I just happened to hear WSU in us. He's over to country music. Yeah. Because he's a luckiest thing I ever did. And here's Neil Rogers. The only thing I knew about him is what I had heard you say on the radio. And he's just as good as you. Both of which ones true by the way. I know. I know. Well, I won't take any more time. I just wanted to say hello. Thank you, Charlie. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. I'm a great life. Bob I. 1242 a WSU D. They love me. They love me. Over there, they loved you. Over here, if you consider a watch the, the man, the braward, it's like a protest. There's not one line that we have three braward lines. They're all like silent. 524Wild. And in fact, why don't you show some guts in braward and call up and tell us that he sucks or something they're creative. God, they didn't even want to say that. Which I think is really a ton of your lot. Top and springs. Hello. Top and springs. I'm on a wrong line. I think I just got them all. I am so emotional now. Top and springs. There you go. Excuse me. Was my mistake? The first one this year. Neil, I want to tell you the undoing of Bob Land. Okay. Here we go. Now this is the call we've been waiting for. This is why last year is up in Iowa, Shoblin corn. Okay. We're all started when he was a big shot around here. Yeah. He professed his pure love. Now this isn't, wait a minute. This isn't open calling isn't it? No. No. No. Okay. He professed his pure love to the fabulous mute. Oh my God. What? The fabulous mute. Oh, the fabulous muller. The red muller. He had our way. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? He professed his love on the radio to a professional record named the fabulous muller. No. He did a lot of me. He was, I'm going to tell you something. He went and he was a referee at a match. Yeah. Muller won. He disqualified her. He had the record down for the count of three. Last year, Gabriel the count of three. He disqualified her. She beat the hell out of him. He's going down the table. He was just going down. He was walking up from here. He then goes up to work for some little jerk named Drew Hayes and Chicago. A little poor po, no, is it? But he knows about a radio. He couldn't even find where the hell to turn the damn thing on. Much less than anything about radio. A top, a tour of a screemer, a maniac, and absolute miscreate, who shouldn't be allowed in a building, much less being programmed to record a major market 50,000-mort radio stations. he does have a beautiful wife unless he dumped him with you. Well, that's, that in 40 cents will get him a week cup of coffee on rest. But I'm telling you this, the other thing last, I'm still waiting for the $50,000 that I won when you were working at Pop. Any caller that called him one night, $150,000. I called, I'm still waiting for the $50,000. Where are you going to pay up? Sir, sir, you forgot that the entire time we were doing that, Michael Serio kept coming on the air and saying, don't believe me. My brother, radio loser. There are no other way. There are no other way. There are no other radio hooks. Serio's now running at $255 station in Pasco County, called WPS. I know I talked to him last night, I was asking for work and he can't hire me. Well, you could hire, you could pay a dollar, 98 a week. Well, no, he was offering $10. $10. Where did they get that budget? Well, well, for the three-hour shift. Oh, and he was only going to have the three-week. Actually, it's a one-hour shift and they replay it three times. Yeah, that's right. The check-through probably bounced. And all the time. Not so much station, too. Huh? Just got to a lot of station tuning? No, no, no. I'm going to, in all seriousness, Bobby, come back. I know that Cox doesn't have the ball to hire you. They could bring you on, put some local talents here on WSUN. It'd be really nice you'd be working with the sister station of the warm. That would be great. I mean, wouldn't that be something? That would be great. I know people with the warm. And you could get out of Iowa or wherever the hell you are right now. Well, this is with just germinating a little seed here today, sir. We just put it in the water and let's see if it's proud. Well, if I see wet it out, if it's not. If I see roads change to the front door of WSUN, I'm going to have to have a ball moving. I'll talk to you guys later. Maybe that's what roses do. And have a great day. By 1246 in WSUD. We have an open line out of town. Bob Lasseter, it's your last 15 minutes today and maybe ever. I took it another hour. Maybe no chance. This is terminal. No, seriously. No, I'm Tony. You have to threaten them. I told you that years ago. You have to threaten them a lot. And then they just go away and they're gone. Here's a mobile in Miami. Don't be a last hit or hit. Here's a call from the keys on the star line. Hey, rescue this man. Rescue. I left in Davenport, Iowa. And it's an honestly God. What a terrible place. I couldn't believe it. He calls me last night. I said, where are you? When he said Davenport, Iowa. And I thought like he was being held prisoner. It was horrible. I left Pokemon a girl went to Ruppy to Davenport, Iowa for three years. It was like going to another planet. Anyway, you're in the wrong game. You've been watching it for nine. It's a nice thing. It's a change to this. We're about gambling now. And I heard that. Some people said, wait. You still write the Quad 50 times. I'm talking about putting clothes on the animals in the zoo. Well, yes. Well, I mean, the windows is the camera. The lights are actually there now. Put this guy back on the Getty Mood, Iowa. Do something to rep you tonight to get a be there. And they all, I'm out of material. Okay. That's obvious. Well, 47, we have an open line of the Sterlin Sterodee, St. Peter's Bird. St. Hello. Yes. Come on, air? Yes, sir. I'm from St. Peter's Burke Beach, not to be confused with St. Peter's Bird. Well, there is a major news. So the West Coast area that makes so bold look like a third world country. Yeah. I just wanted to say welcome to this area. It's so great to have some relief from this FLA crap. The best thing that happened this year is to have you guys come into the area. The best thing that happened two or three years ago is we got rid of Lester and send him to Chicago. Well, will you have FLA's snuck? Oh. All right. We're almost as bad as capacities. Call a Hassy. Hey. Hey. You got it. It's Bob Jr. Bob. Yeah. How you doing? Pretty good. Just do that one, go. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, an echo. There is an echo in here all the way from Davenport to Uranus. I'm famous for the old spam for lunch. I'm the two-man. This is where you only wish you had a color like this guy, Bob. This is one of the greatest colors in history. Three are. This is a creative guy who's got sense of humor. I, I, I, I, I, I can't talk for anything, but I, but I sure can play a mean Trombone. You sure can. He wasn't as war. He was as pedophile. Right. Do you know Hank Goldberg, Bob? Oh, no, I don't. Boy, are you lucky? No one year in such a good mood. Well, I'm on a material. He, he. In fact, I understand that Bob and Hank, Bob is going to mate his eyelids to Hank's Chins. Have a great day, sir. 1253. Let's do a lady in Fort Latterdale for Bob. Hello. Hello. This is, this is Fort Latterdale. You got one, Howard. Well, thank God for you. And I have listened to you for a long, long time when you were down here. I broke my heart when he left you go. I broke my heart, too. I was, listen to you that whole day when you was, when you had to hold, it was a whole crew there that day. When you had that, talk, maybe. Say, man, yeah. Yeah. Right, when you got you mad. Yeah. That's right. Howard. Yeah. The way he's in that big talk show in the sky now, I just went and passed it. He's not going to know that. And then, of course, Bob got all worked up and said, on the ear and that was it. He did. I heard he might be mad. He said, sir, you are full of. And that was it. I'm, I really miss you. And I wish he'd come. You know what? And by the way, the guy was full of. Now that I think. He's your wife. But I've never called a radio before. Well, thank God you did. Man, why are you people in Broward so hard to motivate? I can't go. See, I draw out all these first time. Why are you going to draw out? I'll tell you why I am. I will not sit in the hole to phone for half an hour and talk to him. Well, more power to you. You've got more sense than most. If I can get out, I get out. I tried to get me a once before. I forgot to know what it was. But I get the whole amount of human is I hung up. I don't blame him. I'll have a great day. And Bob says, loving kisses. Oh, I just think the world up. My hope you get. I love to have him come out from two to six right behind you. Great. Bob and I are having a clandestine dinner tonight in plantation. Joey Reynolds is going to be there. We're going to plot the demise of Rick and Suds tonight. Have a great day. Okay. Bob, I. Okay, here's the. Are you going to shoes off the door? Here's Bradenton. Hey, Bob, do it all the Bible back and did for you. Yeah. Got the duck and Iowa. Fowler, out there with you. A foul or no, he's in Tennessee, I think. Or Kentucky. Well, in all seriousness, we haven't had in politics talk radius. Did you left? I mean, the peak of our day is Lionel at four o'clock. Oh, no. Yeah, you still just a collar. He is still just a collar. And then, of course, we have to put up with Rush, Herbert Walker, Bush, Limball from one to three. So I'm real glad to see W.H. You in. I've been kneeling here in the day. Yeah, I like to call my boss at douche back. Okay. Wait, one second. Go in and wrap this guy. Find out something worthwhile. Go let him get to that. I want to clear up something. I mean, I thought I only runs Rush for two hours. I'm sorry, I want to four. Oh, everyone. I've got a side call with you tonight. On tape, tape delay. And they try to con their audience in a believing that it's live. Okay. Okay. Tape delay. So there's no way you can call a guy on tape. I'm the leader. Right. Even if he did take calls, which he really does, because he's just a big, gigantic, right wing, a haremon, gearing, look alike, obnoxious Nazi pig. No question about it. Here they prop again to fouling pig. Not to mention, ponderous and monotonous, too. Okay. We already know the homeless suck and women and gays and blacks and everybody else. And Jews, everybody else sucks. Who isn't a wealthy, right wing obnoxious cow like him. So once we heard of the first hundred times, what else is there to hear? Absolutely. Now he's going to have a TV show. You know, laughter. I really thought that you would be the one to go national. Not somebody like Limpa. Well, by the way, I heard a rumor. And obviously, as usual with our cars, there were full of crap that you were doing a thing on CNBC. And I talked to them. They're doing Bob. No. No. No. I knew they were full of crap. All right. Neil, let me call my boss to do a spag. Okay. Rick, you're a douchebag. See ya. Bye. Bye. Here's Orlando. Hey. Neil and Bob. Yes sir. Hey. I ain't doing pretty good. Listen, I have a high school reunion and we want Bob to speak to the high school reunion. How much you've spent? We've paid. How much? Well, we'll talk. I'll give you the 800 number to call and Neil. Just get a good pay system and they're in dial him up on the phone. Okay. Bob, I'll feed you. We'll be back. Yeah. He's checking his schedule right now. He's checking his calendar to see if he's booked up or not. Next weekend. Oh, okay. We'll be there. Glad to know. He's been in the reason. I think it would be great. You know, Bob used to do that commute from Miami to Tampa back and forth. On a weekend. I think what would be great is if Bob commutes and lives in Davenport during the week. And that comes down like this weekend on an ISUN. That would be good. What a nice drive through the countryside. That would be good for a share and I'll get him down here next weekend because that's one it is. And I bet to the sisters as such big sports. They'd even trade out the gas like a shell card or something. It's a deal. Okay. Nick with time. I told you he don't want to ever do it again. Not a next Saturday. Normal high class 67 over in the crown sterling hotels. You be there. He'll be there. Okay. All right. Good luck to you. I'm a lady in Bratmoth. It'll be all they love me. Hello, Bob. Hi. Hi. We miss you. We love you. And you could play the Congophorce on Friday just for all time today. Play one. The Conga. That's Bob. Very long. I found the sheen. You guys start my show on Friday. It's WPLP by playing the concert. Sure. Whatever makes this lady happy. Yeah. And hey, come back. Well, try. Thank you. Okay. Have a great life. Well, listen, I think we pushed it as far as we can. This was just far beyond our wildest dreams. Believe me. We have like people lighting outside on the 79th Street. Causeway. We have like a lot of people with a lot of people. I do another hour. To demand that we never do this again. I think we can do it. So I think what we might do is like, we'll make you our Davenport correspondent. We got the Bird and Lakeland. We got Bob and Davenport. And we can just talk to people who basically are sitting around. The resting on their laurels. We're going to be a little bit more of a light. I'm not putting that worry. Yes. Bob? Yes, Neil? It was great. Have a great life. We'll be in touch. But I say goodbye, Bob. I could do it. Hi, Bob. Okay. That was. Oh, God. What a guy. A monster in the radio industry. And I think he is serious though. I think he's had it. He's had enough. He finally wiped up and said, who needs this? I mean, unless they're going to pay you a lot. I mean, a lot of money. Who the hell needs this crap? God. And for those of you who are not interested in Bob or what we did for the last two hours. And quite frankly, are pretty pissed off about it. Now you can call it. And we'll have a good time in the last hour.
