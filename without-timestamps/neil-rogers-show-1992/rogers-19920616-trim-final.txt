Hi, go on. You can't understand where you are. You can love my bones. I got a little flagger on my jeep. You can love my hair. I grew with down to there. I tell you all exactly what it means. I'm just another home. The funky country home. I like to play guitar and sing my songs. I ain't no god that clenped, but run down in like this. Enjoy the Rodniks week I could get on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's start it. I was nervous. He used to shake his pills. And make the little girl a squeal of swarne. Now when I sing and dance, in these ten-gallon pants, they say, boy they grow and dig out on the farm. I'm just a muller home. The funky country home. Like you'll contact from Travis straight in the trip. I keep on breaking hearts. Just keep me on the charts until you're all the planet sick of it. Oh yeah. 12-07-Wild D. 12 blinds and date. Anybody out there in date speaking in English? 7-5-1946-3. I'm still very concerned about how come we're concerned. We're getting calls about my gallbladder. And what it looked like and what was in it and what they did with it. And that they were having it for dinner that night. And I can't seem to get like any inside information here. Here's a lady, mobile. Well, hi, Neil. How you doing? I'm doing fine. I wanted to welcome you back. Uh-huh. And I don't want to talk about your gallbladder. Good. We're sick and tired of that damnedest, gusting gross thing. I want to talk about the brains. I'm your emotional blaze fan. While you're doing it. You bet you're well-faithing. All those reds fans who are getting so cocky and so confident right now. They better look over their shoulder because the braves have moved into perfect position now. They're just poised for the kill. Yeah. I just hope we can do it. You'll do it. You'll do it. In the past, in the past, you used to be being a braze fan was a lot like having gallbladder disease. You're just appreciatingly painful. Like being a cubs fan. So watch it. Yeah. You're a cubs fan for years and years and now we're accepting our revenge on the rest of the national week west. Well, let me just say this to you. The braves haven't won a long time, but the cubs have won a penance since 1945. I know. I was about 45. 47 years. I know. I was about 45. 47 years. I know. I was about 45. 47 years. I know. I was about 45. 47 years. I know. I know. I was about 45. 47 years. I know. 50% chance of rain. When that only means, it's a 50% chance of rain. It's going to be raining on your head at that given moment. I mean, if you look outside today, there's a 100% chance of rain. It's a question of whether you're going to be in it, any good idea though. Because they recorded it seven hours at the end of the day. And the only other thing, I hope he's listening. I wanted to say, Michael Conferen, you are a woman. Well, what's the fucking description. I hope that. Well, OK. All right. See you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. God. 1209 and WIOD. We have an open line in Broward 524WIOD. Pompano. I got an answer for the bitch that just called about the braves. The reds are going to dominate. He's alright. That's not why I call. Okay. Well, you have no room to talk. The cops are... What do you mean I have no room to talk? Sir, we're like one game out of second place. We're headed those pathetic meds. We've won five in a row. We're smoking it, man. We're smoking the ivy right off the outfield walls. I had a meds. Let's think about that first. That's how we care about. Don't you understand a cubs fan at this point. We don't think about winning it. All we care about is if we could finish it out of the meds. Even by a thousandth of a point like we did last year, that makes it all worthwhile. It's worth showing up for. Do you see Samberg at me out to play yesterday? Yeah. He is slow, but he wants no one to call. I'm telling you one thing. You're worth seven million, any? Not. God, he's making me sick this year. Every time he comes up with a runner at the third and less than two out, he pops out or strikes out. He can't hit the fly ball. Seven million dollar man. He can't even hit the ball out of the infield. But this isn't his time of year yet. That's right. That's right. Once it wants worth 30 games out and it gets into the late September man, he gets smoking. That's right. We got one player besides Dawson. We got one player and that's Mark Grace was hitting about 320. And we did everything under the sun. We tried desperately to get rid of him because he didn't fit in. He's too good for us. Yeah. The reason I called is that little tape that the guy played right before the top of the hour. That was Joe Peshie from JFK. Remember that? Oh yeah, right. When you were like, right before he blew his brains out, or however he. Do you know that Joe Peshie was in once upon a time in America? Well, you know that I found out on Channel 7's commercial yesterday. Right. That's how I found out. I did not know that. Yeah, I didn't either. I've got it on tape and I've seen it about 10 times. That's pretty good moving. And if you see that about 10 times, that's about 20 weeks out of your life. Because that thing goes on forever. It's not a godfather to the first time this weekend. Really? It was fantastic. Oh, here's a guy who finally is see you waited long enough. I'm happy you waited. You didn't do like all these other people who rushed into the theater or their video store. So they could compare it to one and two. He just launched it based on its own merits like separately standing and it's great. It's exactly as my fact to grow and I saw them with head not seen either the first one or the second one. I don't know where she's been, but she hadn't seen any of the godfather movies. And we rented that and watched it. The next I was Saturday. The next day we ran out and she had to see a godfather. She couldn't wait. Yeah. And. And what happened? She loved that too. But I thought I launched it there for a second. No, I just thought there was had to be more to the story than that. No, that was it. I mean, what what can you say? She loved the movie and that was it. I went. Why did I wait? She wasn't there like. So we're polite. Yeah. Suspended sentence. Anyway. I said. Can you play dirty Harry Carrey for my friend Rick Taylor who's huge back? Sure. Thank you. Good job. I like the way you did that. You know, it was that that was that was very good man. That was artfully done. Here's a guy who actually have a little bit of a thought before he picked up the phone and called Willie Nilly. We have an open line in the center score.

My quick story. I was in Lynchburg, Virginia. Small town. All of a sudden, a very familiar voice gets on the radio. Mike Reneri doing a spot for an auto auction in Lynchburg, Virginia. Are you serious? Oh, my guy almost. Crap. Really? Yep. Almost ran off the road. He didn't say, Uga Mugadini. I don't know what he said. Oh, God. I don't think they allow you to say that in Lynchburg. Very far along. It's all been out of shape if you say Uga Mugadini thinks it's like a witch doctor talk. Yeah, I don't. But he goes, I mean, it's Mike Reneri here.

That's a good one. I wouldn't take you to a dogfight, even if I thought you could win. Ha ha. Don't cry down my back, maybe you might rust my spurs. Ha. If fingerprints showed up on skin, I wonder who's I'd find on you. Ha ha. Here's a good one. If you get the feeling that I don't love you, feel again. Here's one. Obviously, it's some guy singing this song, and he's in some cheap, bluesy, his bedroom at the time. I'm ashamed to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave. We'll just take them on. Thank you. That kind of sums up our situation here at WLS too. Shame to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave. We'll just take them on. Thank you. I've been flushed from the bathroom of your eyes. Ha ha. Oh, what a hero it. Okay, you really wonder about guys who write lyrics like this. You know how much drink and they've been doing. It's the bottle against the Bible and the battle for Daddy's soul.

Oh, he didn't. Oh, my son sent for it. My dear. You know my son. And I'm not going to tell you who he is. Anyway. That would. Okay. No. I had an emergency one night. I went to bed early and I had this terrible, terrible pain. Yeah. Oh, my God. Is it my heart? What is it? I've only had six major operations. I didn't need this. Anyway, I called 911 when I couldn't stand it after an hour. It was midnight. And I looked right near where you used to be at wind. And I was terrified. Yeah. Well, if I lived in that area, I'd be terrified just to come home. Yeah. Please. My son has been caught in the rain. Burglabar heaven. Neo. So what's the upshot? What's the upshot? I'm getting way behind here already. All right, dear. The first thing they did when the ambulance came was, tell me on the, that, what do you call it? Hey, boss. Troy on the gurney. The gurney. Yeah. And he said, I'm giving you a shot of more scene. I said, how do you know I'm not allergic to more of these? And you know that was midnight.

It comes up at the top of the hour. Let's discuss. Will this a secret? I'm not. If it was a secret, the audience would like that. They like the inside stuff. They don't like you, but they like the inside stuff. He's talking to Jennifer Remin. There you don't have time to mess with you. Jennifer's in her pocket of trying to cut the crap Jennifer. We got to get a microphone on and hear okay. Go ahead. So anyway. That's payback for the day the queen was here by the way. Jennifer, remember that when a queen was in town? And Jennifer was just like, there's so many, which werethless. Huh? Money rock. Yeah, horrible. By the way, what is Hank with Hank with all these, he's a drag queen and he's got the drag queen. King tonight, is he trying to tell us something? Your CPS adora just walked on the home. Really? Well, it's a high window. I saw her. Oh. Now what if she's in the building? I don't give a crap if she's in the building. Oh, okay. No, he has a crap about P.A. adora. God, I'd rather hear his soupy sales again with the Chuck. That was good. Did you see him lately? He's like, he must be gaining a lot of weight or something. He, I'm serious. He came in yesterday. The sweat was pouring off of him. He looked like Richard Simmons in drag. The new P.A. adora was going to be. Oh, is that? There you go. What's up with that? So what were you telling me now? This is not a secret. No. Well, it can be. What was a secret for me? You know, I got to make a comment here. Okay. I really do. I am so tired of the juvenile behavior of the powers that be in this company. On the one hand, I go in the hospital. They were like, I guess they must be at their terrified of me. They are. They don't want to speak to me. They don't want to look at me cross side. They're afraid that I'm going to like, What am I going to do? Am I going to quit? What the hell am I going to do? Where am I going to go? Something to think about. It is. What's all food's is number again? But seriously, what is wrong with them? Why can't they sit down and talk like, Well, I was going to say intelligent adults. I know the reason for that. Like adults. They sit down and have like a given a take in a young and a young. Look at those lines drop off there. God, they just heard the first note of your voice. I know. I don't do that. Thank you. Yeah. So the deal is we're going to get a one of these digital things. Yeah. To replace all of these everything. Cart stuff. Every. All these carts and looks like the Sequoian National Forest in here. So we put everything like on master stuff. Yeah. It just gets dumped into a hard drive where it just gets memorized. And that's it. And then how do you call it up? You just punch up a you like if you want something to do with the D and you don't know what it is you punch up D everything that's in there that's D. You single it out. Push a button and it's on your instant. Well, wait a minute. Let me ask you that you wouldn't put everything on. That's like. Let me say it again. You wouldn't put everything on that because if you want to use like some little quick drop-ins or something. I already asked that. Like for example. Like that. I already asked. I better not touch that by the way. If that cart gets eaten up because you don't know how to never say that again. In fact, we'll ever get a hold of him again. You have it. Oh, he's got it on the master. He's got a land to on him. This thing could make like or land to come alive. I'm serious. And yeah, you would if you if you want to like eight or ten things that you use all the time, you just punch up and just have ready. You just could make one land to one. Come alive. Better alive. You're going to suck me into that. So it's free. Seriously, what would you do with the drop-ins on exactly? And for example, like you're not going to have to punch up every time you want to do it like that. You can have eight or ten of those just standing by. What it does is it has like a buffer memory that just stores a lot of stuff that you need just all the time. And then you have this big central memory that you can pull anything out and store it in the buffer and then once you're done with it, get rid of it or something. So it's not in other words. You would know automatically. And just like I know where a lot of these carts are. Right. You know what that is. It would be like in your head and you just hit that exact. Like if it was a D seven, then you would just punch up D seven. Yeah. All the time. It's great. Well, what is it? And then it cues up automatically. You could make anything into it. You could have him say in that meal guide in a loop forever. Just over and over and over and over as fast as you want or as slow as you want. He could do it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Slow as I want to say. You could make it faster, faster, faster, faster, faster, slower. Yeah. Exactly. You could turn anything into a loop. No, good. Anything. And you could have him just go say a loop there and big trouble with him. And you could just have him go kneel kneel kneel kneel kneel. You could cut it off and have it repeat. You could cut it off and repeat. Yeah. Exactly. Did you hear that line that I read from the story that Rich practice sent me about the loop and their big thing with the FCC and where they're appealing the fines. Did you hear that? No. Jim, the Castro who along with Scott Gintel. The owners of Evergreen and the loop. Right. And he's going on talking about why they're fighting back in the Senate. He says we believe that supporting our talent is the most important thing we can do. Don't say that too loud. Can you believe I have? When I read that, I almost just did a number right in the waste basket there. I could I can't still get in fact I'm thinking about it. They make that stuff up. Oh. Sounds good. Exactly. Just make sure that they're smart enough to make things up like that. Just mean, you know, they're just passing money under the table. What can we say to sound good while we're doing it? One twenty one. We have an open line on the star line. If you know anything about what do they call this thing? Digital. What do they call thing? Digital. If you know anything about a digital thing. It's a computer. It's just like a big memory. And it just transfers everything into the memory and holds it forever. Yeah. And then you can just access it and and holds it forever. No. Good. And you could you just have to say Neil Neil Neil Neil Neil Neil. Why don't you say like fixated on that? Why you are? Because your eyes just know that. Oh, you are small potatoes. Well, I wouldn't know Orlando. He's small potatoes and nice guy, but he's like, I use that as an example. What else would you like you to do? He's guys that get naked for everybody. That's that's not a challenge. Exactly. Right. Just to hold up a pair of underwear. Right. I'm jumping them. We're out of them. And are you going to do? Clockers now. Go ahead. Why not? They're the originator of Woodrow's to check it in town in this neck of the woods. They say in the chicken places. And their chicken is marinated in citrus juices, fresh garlic and other ribs and spices. And it's so good. Neil, good. And slow roasted over a hard woodflame rotisserie right in front of your dam. So juicy, so flavorful and so tender. And so moist. It'll just about melt in your mouth. And the chicken, too. And it's low in fat and low in cholesterol and low in calories. Remember the day they brought in that 50,000 pounds or so great. It is fantastic. And a parsley potatoes and baked sweet potatoes and cheddar cheese rice. Which now that I have my gallbladder on, I can eat by like the pound full. And fresh steamed veggies and coleslaw the best in town. And of course, you can have lunch or dinner is little's 375. But if you're really pinching those pennies or anything you can get your hands on. Try the kitty clock. He used to work in power 96. The Nick kid, the kid, curry clock. That's a quarter chicken aside this and a drink off for just a buck 99. Eat in or take that baby out at any of clockers, three locations in North Miami at 100. I heard the day that you were doing a spot for, was it, was it, was it? I was it. I was, it was like, and this never came back. Never came back. Never recovered.
