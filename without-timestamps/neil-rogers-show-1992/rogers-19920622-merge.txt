I listen to you, Rogers, because I can hear the word asshole. Follow 6 at WIOD. We have a nice lady in Sarasota. Hello? Hello? Yes. Do you have to use that vulgar language on TV on radio? Yes. Why? Because I feel like it. We don't use any vulgar language, man. That is absolutely sick. What? And I want to tell you something. Well, you're going to tell me something? For your information, I feel who's don't use language like that. Yes, you do. No, we don't. Yes, you do. You've heard it all. Can I ask you something? Can I ask you something? Well, how about if I ask you something for a favor? I'm going to ask you something. On Sarasota, when you make the call, it's like a one-way conversation. I polite lady friend. How about if I ask you a question? All right, that's me. How long have you been listening this morning? All morning. Well, why? All morning. Well, how can we have it? If well, wait a minute. Let's have a conversation. Okay, let's try. Now, if you're so offended, why haven't you shut it off yet? Well, I, because I wanted to really be sure, and I'm going to decide to make this call, and this is going to be it. Be sure what? Let me ask you something. Well, in other words, after the call, you're going to turn it off. Excuse me. Are you going to turn it off? Ah! Did that bitch hang up? I mean, did that nice lady and Sarasota hang up? We seem to be hung up on Sarasota. Now, as I recall, when I worked there back in 1973, there were like two or three people. They were the IQ bigger than their shoe size. Oh. Oh. But they're probably all dead by now, huh? Or close to it. She sounds like she's getting real close. I was right. No, to train, to Austin, Texas. Oh, when the very lovely lady sat next to my, when she got a ticket, she asked to buy her, but hold her sight. I was more than happy too. So now, there's more I'd like to do. I want to kiss her, but she won't let my age. I want to whisper, so even up in her rear. I want to hold her behind. Close doors and forth. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. When she returned, she said she was an actress. She showed me an album of pictures of her opening, which she then said to none. She seemed as sweet as she could be. But I clearly see she was the kind of girl whose door then hurts and wrecked her door. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. I want to hold her behind. Close doors and forth. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. Well, I'll never forget the train right down to Austin. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. Well, I'll never forget the train right down to Austin. We're saying you're the sweet and we shared our tales. But as my heart tries to leave her behind, regrets are all my fun because I've got to get that girl in the end. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. I want to whisper sweet nothing's in her ear. I want to hold her behind. Close doors and forth. I want to kiss her, but I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. It's time for the two of us. A mid-Witty Archie, Virginia, was telling me that S.U.N.S.S.S.S.S. goes across the Gulf all the way up into Tallahassee. He said, in the middle of the day, you can like a local. It just booms in there. The governor is listening, man, to prosaxi supplies in the mail. Can you imagine? Talk about nose pickers in Tallahassee in the pan handle. Here's Arcadia. And then talk about bringing some sanity back to our show, yes sir. Yes, I'm going to stay in Trey. Yeah. I want to give you a little spy report on Rush Limbo. Good. There we go. You ask and you give it. Yeah, there you go. He comes out at FLA at 1 o'clock. After. Let me ask you to see where like that body arm band that hold a big swastika of the body band. I don't know. I've always do that. I've seen him on TV when it was commercial on TV. Yeah, you got to have a big screen to see him. You got to have something big to listen to. Yeah. And it's not a brain either. Yeah, that's right. That's right. So what time is he on one to what? One to four, I believe. Oh, good. That's right. And then Lionel comes on and that's about idiotic radio. Yeah. Well, so what have they got on here? All I'd like right wing slime ball stuff is that all they got? Well, they got Mark Larson. What do you want to call him? And he's they're token like a liberal, right? Yeah, he's Luke hot. The ideal world, no compassion. Yeah. And they're got a few more. We're all entertaining. They got one? Sir? Yes. Jay Marvill. Yeah, I heard about him. Yeah. He heard he's like a do-eye. The disciple of that right wing and I heard he talks about me all the time. He hates me like poison. Well, he doesn't have to even met him yet. He's another one. Another one. Yeah. Okay. You only do on the West Coast. He's a Jew and a right winger. Yeah. Yeah. Well, keep up the good work. Hey, listen, we're going to check for sure and find out. He's saying we finally got some good radio up here. Thanks a lot, buddy. Yeah, bye. Yeah, they're piping us right into our kiddo, by the way. Probably it's past noon on 6.10 News Talk Radio W-I-O-D. Well, that wasn't right. Okay. I had all the right words and not the right order, George. God, we got to give a little cue to our friends up there. They're little slow and what is it, News Talk? Whatever it is. Tonight is 6. It's Sports Talk 6. And South Florida's most pleasant newsboard show. We're going to be a 6.10 News Talk. Come on, you are your team. Batman fights. O! When you were a child, your mother told you to clean your plate because there were people starving in India. You always wondered what good it would do. The fact is, it makes those starving people feel a whole lot better to know that you are not letting food go to waste. Food that they could eat. Clean flight notification bureau can help. Every time you clean your plate, the clean flight notification bureau will let us starving family know about it. Just imagine the smiles on their grimy, gone faces. When they hear you, beaten all your dinner. Oh, gather round everybody. It's a letter from a clean plate notification bureau. It's just little TV grease, but again, no, I don't clean these plates every night last week. Even the people who are in the clean, clean, happy. Look at this, that clean plate. Imagine, link it to make sure it's clean already with. Oh no, I don't know. You and the clean plate notification bureau can do a world of good. A third world of good. 1217 is WIOD on a momentous Monday, man. A day that just kind of makes the twitch inside. Here's a lady in Sebastian. Oh, yay. Yay. How you doing? I'm so excited. We're sitting up here looking over the beach and we heard you on the radio and it was like, yeah, absolutely excellent. It was like, yes. Yeah, it was like, yes. Yeah. Made the day perfect. Well, that's great. Yeah. Yeah. Like, wow. Like Holy Crab. Oh, I don't want to get that old bitch and Sarah Soda upset. All of she turned it off already, right? I can have a good time now. She tuned it out. Well, I love the child. She's busy taking her peanut butter and him now. I love the guy that was threatening you. Oh, my God. I thought Hitler's son was dead. Yeah. Yeah. That was the Joseph Gerbel's junior by the way. Anyway, you're making me smile when it's wonderful. Well, that's what it's all about. I know when I really appreciate it. Can't have a little smile in your piles. Then what the hell's that? Well, you know, these people with no sense of humor that are so uptight and are so psychotic. Just relax, my God. Fifty million years from now, who's going to give it them about any of this, right? Well, yeah. And I want to tell you, too, you know, when you were talking about the governor. Yeah. Well, down here, we call him the Prince of Prozac. Yeah. Down here, we call him a brain dead asshole. We call him. We do. He's pathetic. Oh, we don't want gambling. We don't want this. We don't want it. We just want all your money. That's all we want. Let's close up the schools. Let's, uh, I mean, this guy's incredible. He has things. Well, I happen to be a teacher and he really is. What a Yahoo Governor, Bumpkin, man. We should have seen him come in. Well, I think we did, but you know, everybody just saw that wouldn't exist. Yeah. Anyway, I want to, one good thing I love about politics in America is we always get real good choices, you know, that's my favorite part, yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Well, listen. Have a great day. Okay, listen. And thanks very much. He made my heart pound. You gave me a little bit of a, woo, a body, right? It's just excellent. Don't say rush. Have a great day. Okay, bye, bye. 12 19 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line in day 751. The out of town line is just weight nine in our baby. We're weight nine. Toe free. That means we pay. We pay for you to call us and say something. I say something nasty. How do you like that? What an offer that is. When somebody else is going to pay for your influence and disgusting diet tribes, what how can you get an offer like that, except a company owned by a bunch of dummies? 1 800 944 W.I.O.D. 1 800 944 W.I.O.D. Yes, sir. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in a tentaflora. They go watch you. Watch you, I know that. Yeah. Yeah. I just got them back. I've never been called spring, so I'm going back. And I turned really around. You always got a set on 16. You must have just about driven right into the thing. I drove over. I'm at some festival. Yadels store here. Yeah. And I called. I couldn't believe it. It's just amazing. Today floored it tomorrow the world. I heard that bit from Sir Sir. Yeah. I mean, I mean, I... She's a little bit aggressive. She's a little upset her bag dried up. Yeah. Well, anyway, I just just said to stop and call you, before you know, I just couldn't believe it. Well, get out. Get the hell out of that place. That's how I basically fight. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I just called to say, you know, unbelievable. Okay. All right. Take it. See ya. You know, it's unbelievable. From what? Choola to Inverness. From immaculate to Engelwood. From like the bowels on Dale Mayberry. Can I ask you a stupid question? I don't want to suggest that some of the powers that be over there on the west coast are a stupid. Is our people down here? How can Dale Mayberry? You know, when you're on the expressway down there? And the sign says, East and west. And under the, it says, like East, southbound, west, northbound. How can it, first of all, it's a road that goes north and south. You know, Dale Mayberry and Tampa is like one of the main drags of stadium is on it out west there. And like, it goes north and south. See, and I just said, out west, because I got sucked into the same mentality. How can it say East and west on the signs? And on the same signs, it says northbound and southbound. 12 21 on Newstalk Radio 610. WIOD. There's plenty of baseball action this weekend right here. Join us Saturday and Sunday for the best American. And nationally, gee. 12 25 a WIOD. A lot of people, we were asking during the break. Some of us in the hallway, some of us degenerates. How come they have like stake in shake and burn stake house? And a lot of great eating places over there. That we don't have here. They're no stake in shake so over here. And the reason being that most of the people in this part of the state have their teeth in a glass. So when your customers are going to come in and gum the food, it doesn't need to be like that. Okay. Anyway, I have a cart that I've been threatening to play if I ever got a hold of it, but needless to say was never going to get it from inside the building. Number one requested piece of material. Last two weeks, the call I made from the hospital to Rick and Suds. And one of our great listeners came by Brands, Mark Saturday, headed on cassette and you know, our listening audience is so far ahead of the inside here. It's like day and night. And so when you listen now for the benefit of the new audience, I was in I had that lapar scum at gallbladder surgery that's supposed to be a snap and you're in one day and you're out to all the other crap and these butchers man, these butchers of medicine. The same people you notice by the way who are who never are at the forefront like the thing about MSG on 60 minutes last night, where are the doctors on that? We don't have time for food poisons. We're too busy with drugs. Okay. We're too busy writing prescriptions like for the governor. And when you hear the sound quality of my voice on this call, you don't even know what I'm saying. I didn't take up proctologist to figure out that I felt like I was moments away from death. Hello. Is it right now while he's still alive? I was just going to talk about you. I don't have time to wait. Okay. I know you talk. And this is like, I'm appealing to anybody out there who's got any ounce of insanity left in their body. Something has got to be done. And I'm not being melodramatic or cute to get me out. I'm in Mount Sinai Hospital on the beach and I'm telling you that I'm never going to get out of this place alive. Now for those of them, I'm just going to like a joke. I'm just going to say no joke. Okay. This is you don't joke about things like your health. And these people are going to kill me. I have never been to an experience like this. I remember Bobby used to with the photographer from the hairline years ago. Yeah. We went into a local hospital for a very minor thing. He didn't come out alive either. And I keep thinking about that because this place is in St. Assala. I have a physician who performed a surgery who thinks he's real cute and real flipp. And I can't get all because he's too busy making money doing up the surgeries. And I can't get an answer out of anybody. And here they keep coming up with wilder and wilder stories about pulmonary blood clots that about this. And that is about internal bleeding. Nobody has got an answer for anything in here. Anybody that goes, I remember when I used to have that Bob Mendelssohn on all the time. And by the way, they also killed these dead. Now, seriously, remember Dr. Gettlop Middle East. It's not a uncle. You old him. You sell it. He'll say it by the way. Don't go and I don't ever allow yourself to be in a hospital alone because you have to have somebody to fight for you. And my good fat friend who is the one who advised me about what a great piece of cake the surgery was. It'll parv you during your listening by the way. You know, I'm not going to call for a little lemon juice would have been a lot better than this. You'd have if I stuck it up my butt. Do you know what he stole as you had? That's not important how to know. Don't try to hear it. Oh, I don't know. The younger. I'd be younger is the important because that's the doctor that I can't seem to get a hold of. If I could tell your audience the stories of what's going on here since Friday, they would, but I tried it. They blow their brains out right now because if I had a gun here, I would do it. And I'm not even saying since Friday evening, I will never get out of this place alive. And I really believe that. Doctor, how can I? I've got to anger calling. Oh, Doctor Runger is there. Maybe we ought to do it on the ear. Wow. All right, I'll get that. All right, baby. Okay. Good luck. I'll get back to you, Diana. You talk about a way to get some fast service boy. You notice how quick the doctor was on the phone? And all of a sudden within the like next 20 minutes, they're all these PR people. They were lined up for 20 city blocks. Oh, hey, Mr. Rogers, how you doing? I'm Mr. Joe PR and this is Susie PR. Yeah. God. How you doing? I kept saying to everyone, I'm never getting out of this place alive. And you can, what a sound and that voice, huh? Was I like full of energy? And the smell of fear and death? You can, you can smell it right over the radio. Cooper City. Yes, welcome back in the other day. Yes, sir. I feel I'm didn't know I got out alive. How do you like that? Right. When I came out here a few years ago, the headlines in the local tabloid paper was that you comes to Cooper City. Right. I know how they feel and serve so much. Oh, yeah. Wait until you see the Jew coming to David next week, man. Right, then on horseback like Pral Rerear. A couple of things are heard over the weekend. Now, I thought you kind of the interested kind of go on with your supportive place or a fascist state that we're in. Yes. I don't know about the reliable sources, but approximately 25% of the workforce is in some way shape or form connected with the judicial system. Yes. And the other statement was that there are no black senators. I don't know. Just the independent correlation here. Yeah. But are you in a well, I'll push you aware that there are no black senators. It's a baseball fan. Remember the Washington senators? I remember like, this cereal was white. And Wayne to Williger was white and Camille Puss, squall and Pedro Ramostead, a couple like token Hispanics on there. But no black side. I don't think I got a Washington senators. No. Right. But I would like to know what kind of fight that Carl Lewis, I was as boyfriend as past weekend. Carl Lewis? Yes. He didn't make the Olympic good. Oh, he didn't make it? No. Oh, the ship it must not come in yet. The ship it must have had a comment. Yeah. Well, I was dying. I thought that was kind of quite surprising. And of course, it's a pretty strong room. We're locally that Howard Stern, six to ten hours. Yeah. I'm popping that man. And I like to call my wife. I can't. I can't. I like to call my wife, Sherry, I made your through. Okay. And good to have you back. And happy circus. That's the end of you. 1231 at WIOD. We have an open line. How come we have an Edward from like a whole bunch of Jewish people on the West Coast yet? Huh? Have they kicked them all out? No, I remember when I was in Sarasota. There were a few my pizons over there. Huh? One or two? Come on. Two or three? Seabring. Yes. How you doing? The old fine business. Fine business. Johnny meter. No. No. No. You're absolutely right. Are you serious? You know, I was just, I just mentioned your name within the last 30 minutes. You won't believe that. Is that right? You won't believe what I said either. No, you just know because our chief engineer was here to tell me about where S.U.N. is. Right. And I said, you know, it all friend of mine. John meter took me out there one time years ago. And we drove to the end of the peer. You remember where it was? Oh, yeah. We're in the old million dollar peer. Oh, that's not there anymore. No. I've placed it now with, uh, I don't know what. Like a new million dollar. That was when one of your favorite Jewish people owned it. Who was that? I love and some. I don't remember that. Oh, you do have a much better memory for all that old crap. Yeah. You probably going to start talking about Wayne Wright. Well, you know, and our good one. And who else? Alice, short skirt. Rally, short skirt. Let's go back to Marshall, Michigan, man. Those were the good days. Yeah. We had run a Sunday. We sure did. Yeah. Didn't make any money, but we sure had a lot of home. We used to have a dinner at wind shoolers there. Yeah. Oh, God was that a great. Yeah, my wife Sharon used to feed us once in a while. Your ex wife Sharon used to feed us. Yes. She was just the only one in a while. Where is she? She's still in West Palm Beach. What? Owen West Palm Beach. That's right. You were at WIRK. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a John meter. One of the great stars of radio. And like some of the smallest markets in history. Seabring Florida and Marshall, Michigan and L. L. Be in Wishman. Wait a minute. Yeah, I was pumping. On WSU, I'm in St. Pete. Right. That's that's why I was a great. That's what I was a great station. Yeah. Did you know that they're signal now they get up to tell a Hassy and a two egg and Perry. They did? Oh, yeah. I didn't help you did it, John. Yeah. Hey, wait a minute. Don't put seabring down. This is a beautiful place. I love it here. I'm going to take a look to other calls from Seabring. Already this morning. Well, you had something to watch. Sure, and our kid, you know, the radio station I worked for. It's signal covers that. And what was it? I keep keep. What was the other one? The two stations here are. AM is all taught. We have your favorite person on right now. Rush limb back. Oh, yeah. Heinrich and drag. Yeah. Yeah. It's all heard. Yeah, right. Well, we are. AM is taught 24 hours a day. We were just sitting here deciding should we put a car on the road. There you go. Now do something smart for what's your life. Wait a minute. One of the owners is standing here. He said, no, no, no, no, John. We want to keep our license. Oh, I see. But it was really great to hear you. I can't hear you. I like to hear you. Some chicken crap on her up there and see. Bring was just no brains and no balls. Is that to deal? God. Not at all. Not a lot of great people. I love it. Well, that's good. He belongs in radio. It's a perfect place for him. What? In fact, you ought to be a Cox broadcasting. Basically the same. Who should? I don't know. Whatever his name is. Well, right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That was fine business. Remember? Right. I do it. When you said that, boy, almost just like dropped it right in the waste basket. You can't believe that. Well, I called earlier and left a message with your receptionist to give it to you. It's fine business, Cole. But I figured that I'd never be able to get through on this one. John, I got news for. If you leave a message with our receptionist, there's only one thing that's going to happen to it. She's going to eat it. Believe me. Hey, Neil. It's really, really great hearing you again. Now that I can tune in on issue. You end my old alma mater over there and thank you to his birthday. So how does that you went coming in and see, Brink? It comes in fine, fine business. Fine business. Yeah. Great. Hallelujah. I promote you because you're in competition, though. No, we're in an area. No, we're in an area. What's you have like, oh, you have talk. We got, yeah, we're talking 24 hours a day. We got Rush Limbaugh on now. Like I said, with a crap, you got on what difference is it made? Hey. Hey, look, probably have one of your heroes on here at three o'clock. Who's that? Alan Combs. Who is that? Alan Combs. You know, I have one question Neil. That's the Romeralum Combs. Yeah, I have a question before we get off. Yes. Why do you take the low? I mean, they're couldn't possibly be anything said that you haven't already said. Bye, bye, John. Bye, bye, Neil. See ya. Okay. John Meter. Oh, man. All of a sudden, it's like somebody pulled a plug on the animal bag and it's open up the whole state like a whole world. All these new horizons that have opened the world. Let have opened the world. And keep in mind, this is all by accident. The only people we're hearing is today, it's like an accident. It's just like Wiod. The only people who discover us, it's by accident. Because we're sure never going to get any promotion over here. 1236 on News Talk Radio 610, Wiod. Hey, morning, get the scoop on what's happening this weekend on the weekend magazine with Chuck Meyer. Who's the greatest success in Wiod. Excuse me, yes.

It's a version pink coat, sort of a bitch. I can't believe what's the SEC here? We're no longer radio station here. I'm not sure if you're going to be in your eyes or so. And if you're going to make your head spin up coming out of my name, I'm a rap or anything. I'm going to blow your name, handle. And have a nice day. Okay. South Miami, hello. Yeah. Or I saw your favorite big little bitch on TV. I was on the West Coast. It seems like your buddies next start the coast of a new radio station or middle crowd this year. The shore. The shore. Are you cereal? I'm cereal. What is that? Wait a minute. Let's see. Do we have an FM? Is it WRM warm? Yeah. That's it. You're the shot. Do you realize that that station is number two in the market in Tampa St. Pete? Right behind the FM Country Kick in station? Please. WRM. The shore. Are they playing a slush over there, too? I don't know. I would give to listen. I just saw a TV commercial with her big little lips and come and listen to us. All you mean that bitch that's on the TV spot? Yes. She don't know whether she's on the coast or the shore. She doesn't know where she's from. Or on Uranus. Not on the shore. Not on the shore. Not on the shore. Anyway, listen. Or WRM. The shore. Well, you're having such a problem with these people over there. Yes. You're not married to your sister. Right there. Right. That's right. That's the whole thing to do. And I don't have those sheep in the backyard either. No sheep. The light will real well. No. Can you play the country music? Well, the two guys that have the little dress here. The little dress is out of the country music. I mean, the country music song titles. Yeah. Where the hell am I going to find that? What? You played as a bother. A lot of big real deep. Okay. You did a really frustrating job. That'll do it over there on radio. Son, man. You got it. Okay. Bye-bye. Here's a line from a song. It took a hell of a man to take my hand, but it sure didn't take you long. I like that. Yeah. She ain't much to see, but she looks good through the bottom of a glass. Oh, yeah. I heard that one. That's a good one. I wouldn't take you to a dogfight, even if I thought you could win. Don't cry down my back, baby. You might rust my spurs. If fingerprints showed up on skin, I wonder. Who's that? I find on you. Here's a good one. If you get the feeling that I don't love you, feel again. Here's one. Obviously, some guy is singing this song, and he's in some cheap bluesy's bedroom at the time. I'm ashamed to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave. That kind of sums up our situation here at WLS too. I'm ashamed to be here, but not ashamed enough to leave. We'll just take them on. Thank you. I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart. Oh, what a hear it. You really wonder about guys who write lyrics like this. How much drink and they've been doing. It's the bottle against the Bible and the battle for Daddy's Soul. Here's one I really like. It's Commode Huggin' Time in the Valley. If you want to keep the beer real cold, put it next to my ex-wife's heart. My wife ran off with my best friend. I miss him. Okay, Larry Lou Jack, little Tommy from WLS.

What's the other delay on here? What do you mean by that? Well, I got my walk man on man's gun. I can hear the delay and then I hear you. That's when he gets the old one. When you were in other words, when you were on hold. Somebody says crap that we just dump it on. Because we don't want no vulgarities on the way. We don't want to be saying crap on the ear, sir. You don't want to fin this. We don't want to offend all those old farts over there in Sarasoto. Okay, so we want to make sure that nobody says on the ear. That's right. We want to hear some moral. Damn straight. All right. You had a good day now, buddy. I got pulled over there by the old police this morning to us. Want to let you know that. You mean they're doing it over there? They're doing it here. They're doing it up a name on park. The parkers are outpugs. The park patrol. Well, listen, don't don't forget those pig reports. We want to start doing this all over the state. Okay. Hey, I think we are too. All right. Get them steam. Okay. You got it, buddy. Bye-bye. Bad. 12. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, is there hope for the human race he asked? 1246 at WIOD. We have an open line on that new out of town. Like, God, it is smoking, man. It's smoking. We had John meter. I forgot that Johnny meter were about the old fun seeker. What's Bill Gray doing now? Don't call back, John. We're going to call me another day. We'll talk about the fun seeker from battle creek. Oh, God. Man, we've to get some inside stuff that nobody will have any idea what we're talking about. For a lot of Dale. Hey, how's it going? Great. Best show in three years. Yes, sir. It's about time they opened up our horizons and kept us from this imprisonment in this little Yahoo corner of the world, right? You got it. Y'all know what's going on now. I don't want to say hi to the more of. Never mind. To one. Okay, couldn't handle it. Just faded out of the pressure. 1247 a WIW. Now wait a minute. Let me say it again. 1247 at news talk radio 610 WIOD. The opinions expressed in this program. I'm not necessarily the O's of 610 WIW. The response is. I got a facts. I got a facts from one of our spies in Tampa Bay. We had the wrong info on Jay Marvin. By the way, somebody gave you some bum information. Because it says here he's not the right wing. He's left wing. Actually, in OK guy, the best thing FLA has gone for it. Two issue oriented so the show can be boring. Best feature regularly attacks racist Republicans and other neo Nazis. We love you, Jay. Even though you hate me like poison. You're OK. Yeah, we think. Let's see. Mornings. They got out gardener in company. The show is a very realistic, nambi-pan-by guy who clips the Tampa Tribune the same P times in USA today and repeats their articles on the year. Yeah. There you go. It says this city at once claimed that listeners should throw their newspapers away. It is long, laborious interviews. Redeming feature. None. Midday Mark Larson. It says this ding-dong owns a radio production company. And once worked on the pig. The power pig WFLZ. Couldn't make it at the pig. So Jay Corse saved this loyal backstabbing employees job by throwing them on the AM. It says he really does put his hand behind his rear ear when he talks. It's at a, etc. Midday Rush Fath, the right wing slime ball after no one's lying on. And attorney who used to call in on a weekend's got a weekend gig because he was so talented and had such a beautiful voice. Not. And then full time. It's his obviously his practice wasn't going so well. Talent rating for redeeming feature. Jay Marvin that we were wrong about except he hits me like poison which is fine because he's jealous. And then the best part it says it also says the rest of the night. Tape playback of bush-bing bang and Bruce Williams as are the weekends. And I was wrong. W, W, W, R, M is warm. The shore is like in four mires of somebody else. So don't get them confused. Get the coast and the warmth and the shore all in the right spots. Okay. But here comes the best part. It says on this facts from our spy and Tampa. Remember that Jay core is getting set to go under. It's $140 million worth of debt is Colleable in August. The company's assets totaled more than 125 million. So it won't be long. Oh. Now that's I'm just repeating what's in effect. I don't know that to be true or not, right? That Jay core is going bust. And then all the people at WFLA will be lined up at Crystal. Man. 1254 at WIOD. Let's go to Tamarack. Hello. Maybe this move of ours will help like put them over the edge. Pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. First of all for the old bag in South Dakota who called up earlier. No, but you know, she's not listening anymore much, right? The location is asshole asshole asshole. There. I had to get that out of my system. Really. Hearing her. And he was complaining about the vulgar language. Well, she's probably sitting on the radio now. I wouldn't be surprised. I listen to that doost thing bangers on another station. The Tampa Bay Area 2 at BRD in Great Britain. The big bird in Bradington that carries the Pirates games. At least they used to. Yeah. I figure at 1420 in the town. They probably just as powerful or maybe. They're like about six watts. Because I know when I worked in Sarasota and back in those days was a Pirates fan. And I used to try to hear the big bird at night. And I used to have to like drive halfway from Sarasota to Bradington to hear it at all. Yeah. So I didn't know if they were comparable to the light bulb or not. Yeah. Very similar. And when you mention the sure, I think the parents for my is there at 94.5 FM. Their call is a WCVU. And when they get the term sure out of those call it is, I have no idea. Maybe Dinos sits on a transmitter. That is a possibility. And there are journals. And judging from some of the calls you've gotten from the Tampa St. Pete area, and you wonder whether they didn't get a baseball team. And now it's the big thing now. Yeah. We got the marlins by the way. We got the marlins. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. I shouldn't say that. Yeah. And where do they have to get the giants? Nothing but the chance. They'll probably get the giants, man. They'll probably get like an established team with Matt Williams and that ugly will Clark and Roger pardon me from in a coma Craig. Yeah. But what they're doing now with the send-home is I think it's not a world wide distractable or even that. I think that's the only thing that saves that. Well, they are pulling over there. Believe me what I'd tell you. Okay. That's about out of material. But before I go for all the Yahoo's in Tampa and St. Pete, who are listening, I think you should throw on a blue job if you have that for my wife. Let's town with a banana if you or the sometimes I feel for a country. Yeah, we're just emotionally. Like a basket case. This is probably the most exciting thing in Tampa to us in years. Right? Right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is the most exciting thing that's happened for us because you think it's boring over there, man. This is like death. The median age over here is like Matuzla's grandma. Ehm. God. So we're really excited to have you. So to speak. Hi, Alia. How are you doing? Great. This and I don't know how much you listen to the news reports, you know, on the breaks and everything. Not at all. But then people up there that got that call, that wanted to come down and kill you or whatever. No, he just wanted to do well. Be the crap out of me. Okay. And then kill me. Well, he should be happy that our fastest right wing Supreme court just made it legal to burn crosses. Really? Yeah. I understand that the justice rank was going to be burning one right on the White House law to two this afternoon. Well, I'm a bush big bang show. I want to see how these people are going to handle the after a while because they look like half of them are freaking out that you're even on the air. Yeah, listen, let me explain. Let me explain something to you. Okay. WSUN is a spit kick in music station. Okay. Now, if you were somebody who listened to spit kick in music all day and you turned it on and here was this left wing Comey Pinto Fag San Dušbag from Miami. You might not cotton to it right away till after about the third or fourth day. When you started to understand what it was, then you started to like it. You got you got a point. We're not on the move. We're going to like it. Hey, listen, I mean, they're all going to love it. It took most of those guys like a week to get used to their sheep. Do you think by now the bird should have heard that you're on the Europe there and he's listening to you at 10 o'clock this morning? A certain right wing snappy dressing, slob, works on the coast named Johnny Darn. I was on the bat line to Lakeland man just breathing desperately and deeply and emotionally like you can. But you can guarantee go to the bank on it. Okay, bird, we know you're out there listening give us a call. Yeah, we're just give us a break. No hard feeling. Right. We'll see you in big daddy's birdie. Okay, and a slam dunk in doughnut and my tides. Okay. Take care. See you. What an emotional Monday. God, I'm just not prepared for this. 12.58. Here's four miars.

God, he has so excited all those old built collectors. It had been looking for him for a long time. What is this bring back memories of W. Y. and D. And buddy Bud Paxon. And I got news for it when we were over there. That station was just as successful as the Paxon station. W. Y. H. and Z. With its one share. 18th in an 18th station market. Right there in the bottom. Where Bud is used to be. And he's still got that Newark New York mentality. It's put all that money in that home-shlocking network that's got like 50,000 channels all over the satellite. He's still right on the bottom. And where Bud knows how to do it the best. Here's a mobile in Fort Pierce. Oh, New Rogers? Yes, sir. All right. I just want to let you know.

I just, I get the week at the knees thinking about it. It's a great state burgers. Yeah. Yeah. I just wanted to let you know that I'm a cartel fan. I do what he's saying was cartel fan is down here. No. And one of these days that if you do get around to it like the year, you have any old Dan Kelly from the, the blues or... Dan Kelly was great. Sandwich blues and the Montreal Canadians before that. Wait a minute. I got just a minute. This is going to come as a great shock to show you. I mean, talk about getting something on demand. Wait a minute. I got a hairy call from 1964 when he was still doing the carton. That's with no white and the whole gang and forlip. All right, listen. There now is Bill White. A man of scoring position with one out. The carton is leading by a run five before. Most stretch. And the fact. There's a car. What a car. That might be a tough thing. Oh, oh, oh, oh. How about that? I got he was coherent back then. Yeah. But Bob didn't have as many buds back then. He was just doing buds wife, but that's another story. I was just watching the, the, the police came a couple days ago and it just pathetic the way he's got. Come on. Don't pick on Harry. Now you must understand. I'm a Cubans service. So just, you got to understand. When you get to be 100 years old, you didn't have that many beers. You're a little bit coherent too. If you have any tank, Kelly, eventually it'd be fantastic. I love the blues and love the car. No, not many fans. You mean you're a hockey fan, sir. Now we're talking a man who's got a brain on his head. A hockey fan. Back in the 70s when the early 70s and blues had a couple of Stanley Cup finals in the old Western division. Yeah. It was all the, uh, the routine. How about Bill Hewitt? The boxer is wrong. Kelly. That's the footer. Yeah. Perfect. It is. One other thing. I'm sorry to keep it so long. I just wanted to, I got a copy. I tried between Miami and for Latterdale. Typically I work up here in Latterdale. Well, I'm up here for Pierce now, but he's working in Latterdale. I was driving back home at 5.55 pm on Friday at a Hyundai old beach boulevard. And the cops stopped me for driving in the, at the time and late. Right at the end of the day to seem, it seemed kind of outrageous. That going south by on a 95. At that time of day, there's really no reason to have a cop station there. But he was sitting in the median. Just wait for somebody to just put by and I happen to be the lucky bastard. So, um, thanks a lot for taking the time out to speak with me and that's good talking to you. Okay. Leafs are ulcer. Thank you. See you're like a lindro. Assigning with a rangers. The Leafs are just so pathetic. Tree and Sarah soda. Yeah. Hi. Are you done? Great. That's great too. What's going on over there? Well, you got all of those fuggies picking on you. All right. You don't want to tell me I should take an enumer. But you got to have something beside you. No, it's to pick right, sir. Well, I don't have that time because I got too many rabbits. I have to take care of you take care of rabbits. Yeah, I'm a rabbit farmer. So what's wrong with that? That should be a lot of fun watching them out there adding in multiply. That's it. There you go. That's making a lot of money. Good. That's what we, if you got a lot of money we're happy for you. Just send us a bag full. Oh, well, you get a bag full of whatever you want. Right. Or some rabbit droppings or whatever. No. Okay. Whatever. Yeah. That's a guarantee. We can use them for bingo markers over here. Man, that's off the old people do over here. They go to bingo. No, they can't. They can't go to bingo no more. Oh, yeah, they can. They raised their raised holy hell about that, sir. Yeah. But they can do anything you want here. Okay. You can do, you can take away the whole bill of rights. But don't take away their bingo. They won't put up with that crap. Not over here. We got a, not here laughing. I'm serious. We got to have our bingo, man. Well, I got a, I got to say one thing. Yes, sir. I used to listen to you on the ring of your whole time. Where? Oh, what other station you were on? Well, where were you? Is there a sort of? Oh, WSPB. Right. Well, that's 1973. That's like another lifetime. Well, look. We're going to tell you. Yeah. We ain't dead yet, are we? That's several burying animals ago. Now I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I was that question again. Let me think about that one. All right. Let me ask you another question. I know I'm not. Yeah. What is it? I called up St.P. And I made a complaint about you. And I have to apologize. You are too. I apologize. See, this show takes a little while to grow on you. Like a big tumor. And I know, in, I don't care about your gold blood. It's an old person in old thoughts out there. Right. I've been listening to your music. The only thing I'm against is the curtain on the phone. Wait a week. Now, hey me out. Yeah, here you go. Okay. And the woman turned around and said, well, I want to do listen to it. Listen to them for a day. And then maybe you'll get the like it. Right. And I don't know. I want my country of Western music. It was that. And for all you old folkies out there listening, I think you should sit down and listen to this man. Right. Because this man is telling you to truth. Any plan is his way. Right. Of course I say, I think you should have a little bit more country and Western on your songs and your... But as far as asshole goes, my son broke out laughing. Really? As far as... Maybe he knows what. That was great. He was laughing too. Well, that's good. That's what life is all about, Sarah. Just a few laughs every night. And if we can't have a good laugh, what the hell is it worth getting out of the second and morning for all the kind of who you're in there with? All right. All right. Only Renoir called up his like a pilot, y'all. I listen to the lady. Well, the apology is accepted. And I want to tell you you're a great American. All right. And say hi. I can say his one thing. Yeah. Because I go out and see the rabbit. Right. And you're going to get a rabbit sent to you if you like it in there. I love rabbits, man. Okay. Anyway. Those raisins, man. It's really something. Watchin' those raisins in the cave. Yeah, you ain't got 4,000, 800. So hell. Who? I bet you got like a whole raisin' rabbit. You're raising it. I felt more bloody. Balloni than I would have called it. That's a rat. Oscar Meyer, right. Anyway, we love you. Have a great day. I'm all focus. The go-kiss, my ass. All right. Bye-bye. Clean up your eye. One third. See now we got him doing it. Jeez. I'm not a monster. Now you don't want to get all those old women in Sarah Soda all excited? God. They're going to be taken their midday douche pretty soon if you don't calm down. Jeez. 137 on news talk radio 610 Wild. This fall join us for another exciting season of dolphins in Hurricanes football action right here on South Florida's Sports Station. Tell me you are your team.

No, I just want to thank you for shaking up all these lame, brave red necks of noise. That's what this little shake in quake. Well, they don't know the answers from the home of the ground. Right. And in some cases, this is no difference. But, uh, yeah, just real two two up here. It's two two. Yeah. Okay. All right. Don't wear it. 142. I know you. I know you. Here's a lady in cross brings.

This is lady that got fired at the fish place. Yeah. Lady got fired at fish. About looking for job. Well, hey, listen. You're going to be. I know it's a treat cliche, but you're going to be so happy and so far ahead of the game. Who wants to stand around a bunch of smelly old fish all day? Right. But I thought I would just say hi and see how you do when I was coming. Well, thanks for coming by. We sure had a nice turnout at Brandsmart Saturday. You know what? Yeah. You just look a little white to me. Well, you know what I did? What? Yesterday I went out and laid in the sun all day. You look better. My mother was kind of worried about you. I got my color back. She said she was a little worried about you. Yeah. I'm going to take this home. They said in Tallahassee in the day time. This is a very good job. Good luck. Don't need any smoke fish. Oh, not for me. Okay. Fair. Bye. Have a great day. 143 at WIODO. I bet you're going to be playing all of those today. Man, starting at number one and right through at number 50,000. Yeah. Yeah. Got the crap. When you stop, when you stop, did you see the coverage map of this? They said in Tallahassee in the day time. The station is like a local S.U.N. I'm Tanya in Orlando and Kissimmee in the Sea Bring and Sebastian. Oldsmarre and Twig and Perry and Imaquely and just got. Oh, man. We feel like we've been liberated. We want to be free, man. We want to be free. We are free. And speaking of Rick and S.U.N. That's the right price for their show. Free. And you'll get it for you. Wait till they listen. Audue will fart to pretend that you're upset, but are really Charly and giggling and having a good time. You think this has been something tend to do every day. Wait till you hear Rick and slot from 2 to 6 here we have to do it. It's going to take you a month just to figure out what the hell they are. They've been here over two years and we still haven't figured it out. God, especially the one with the banana in his mouth. Oh, he's in here right now. So did you see, boy, you smell like a French or house man. God, you stink. Thank you. What the hell? What are you trying to cover up? Some bad body or something? God, you smell serious. You know, usually what you're like splashed it on your body? God. But you're not, oh, he did like a little douche with it. God, does that stink? Do you see this coverage map? We're everywhere. And the ratings over there and about how the sun is like number 13. But now in the next book we're going to be up to number 3. And we're going to pass FLA like they're standing still because they're going bankrupt anyway. Yes? We're all ready number 2. Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm number 1 with them. 1, 4, 5. Here's a mobile phone mirror. Hello. Hey, guys. I'm doing great. Sir, welcome to the liberation of the human race. I'm thinking of liberation. I went to the melting pot for the first time. No, I'm talking. Did you have the chocolate dessert? I'm telling you, I couldn't fit it. You couldn't speak. You couldn't. You couldn't. I was so stuffed. Yeah. That place was incredible. They do give you a lot, boy. But when you, if you save room and dip that banana in that chocolate fondue boy, that's like Dina Glandell. Yeah, it was incredible. Yeah. But the best restaurant in my house. It sure is. Did you catch the Dave Dane? I did see that Rick O'Reilly here got lucky for an hour and drove the Viper on a Friday. And that's all he talked about all afternoon. And I never even got to see it. And then last night I watched in Channel 6 news. And I see a monster in the news business. Yeah, I tell you that a Viper must be powerful. If you could drag his fat ass around all over time, it must be something that Ten-Sill and a Viper. Well, Riley really racked on him when he called Friday. But I tell you, it was funny. It was a sight to be seen. However, I must say this to you in all seriousness. I wasn't, because I had seen the pictures of the prototype, you know, last year. And I saw the car with the, I wasn't that impressed. I don't think it looked like I thought it was going to look. It looked kind of freaky to me. But it definitely must have some power. Oh, yeah. You bet. Well, listen. Hope you're feeling better. And by the way, is Dave game? What's that? I said Sally wants to know. Is Dave game. Have a great day. You're too much. Bye. What is done? No one is Dave game. Huh? And if Sally fits, is Rick Squatton. 140, see, that's another thing. We can't be so perocular anymore, because we got to talk about like, the child molester on the TV over there on 13, or what Santa was he on in Tampa? I don't know, something over there. We'll find that. We'll start getting lots of spy reports on the facts. By the way, our facts number for those who hate us like Poison already over here is area code 305 757 7516. Okay. So as soon as you find out that FLA is going out of business, area code 305 757 7516. 148 on news talk radio 610 Wild. The opinion is expressed in this program, and I'm not necessarily those of 610 Wild. The last sponsor. 1502. And what I was thinking, we ought to give all our new listeners a little preview of Rick and Suds. D-Rissusly different, marijuana, deliciously different, marijuana. The Hortimoco. I was on the other guy's ballot. What other guy? The Republican guy. Oh no, man. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, kid. I didn't want to break. Which one is your vote for? I'm not going to get into it, kid. You'll freak out on me, okay? Not, no way. Yeah. That, uh, that, who is it? Frick? What's your one, be specific? What's his name, man? I'm not going to argue, Paul. The guy from CNN. Ted Turner, yes. Oh, man. You voted for Buchanan. I voted for Ted Turner. Dude, why don't you send a police right into my head? I, I don't, I don't, I don't know, I don't know, but I'm in a trash. Ted. And let him come over. Ted, kill me. Ted, Ted, this wasn't a presidential election. This is a primary, okay? I didn't have a chance to vote for the other side. Give me the chance to vote for the side. What? My pal, Rick, voted for a non-sink. I knew this would be that I didn't vote for a Nazi. This is such a says, he gives a good crap. On 53, a WOD, he records sides to the six this afternoon. Free weed for the whole state, free prosack for everybody in Tallahassee. I knew this would be that I didn't vote for a Nazi. This is such a says, he gives a good crap. On 53, a WOD, he records sides to the six this afternoon. And all of the three are in Tallahassee. 153, a WOD, we have an open line in Broward, 5249463, 524, WOD, pop it all on the star line. Hey, I can do. Yes, sir. There's only one piece of this puzzle we're messing now. Which is? I mean, we're talking about notes taken right? Yeah. And we're talking about the tone tone, whatever's going on over there. The corn, Paulen? You know, and I'll tell you they're missing out on this. is their piston out on the great morning show at WOT. Yeah. I mean the office, chilling, chilling. Yeah, that would do it. I don't think they can stand up to that challenge over there yet. They're long way from handle in that. They go into that tramp's mirror come out. Yeah, that's right. See those people over there, they're not used to it. They wouldn't know when to come out of the tramp's right. We can stick a tramp in their pants if we put that stuff on. There you go. And it closing. Yeah. One more thing. Before you go, could you say one more thing? Freeze major. Miami Vice, you're under arrest. Can't do it done. 154. I got a thing here, a card. I don't know what the hell this is all about. It's from one of our chronic listeners who's been sent a me crap for years. It says, Mark your calendars on June 20th, 1992 between nine and 10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, which is suspect to begin with. You're supposed to have an orgasm, it says. That's right. Everyone on the planet is urged to do it at the same time, according to a fellow named Stan Major, who's been organizing a grassroots movement to promote something called the orgasmic communion. I guess it must get lonely over there in Clearwater, Alder in the week, Houston. This new-age style event is supposed to unite the world in simultaneous sexual pleasure creating global peace, world harmony, and better TV reception. That's set away. So anyway, it's a June 20th between nine and 10. But we better find out if it's really standard time or daylight time because it sure would be a shame to waste and have to do it all over again. Here's a mobile in E-Hod Junction. Neil. This is the call we've been waiting on. Neil, how are you? Pretty good. You've made my day. Well, that's great, buddy. Let me tell you why. Yes, sir. I just left and tap up on Friday. Yeah. I went to the Bahamas over the weekend. Right. Crunch my gut. Lost my money. Right. I'm driving home and I hear that Neil is going to be in Tampa. Isn't that amazing? Amazing. It is shocking. You're amazing. So you're in E-Hod Junction. Now what do you listen to now? I'm listening. I just turned over from IOD to 620 and you're not. That wasn't a big switch though, was it? No, it's just like a flip flop. That's the little flip of the wrist will do it. Yeah. Nothing to it. So how does S-U-I'm coming up on E-Hod Junction? Great. So, they sure? Really? Yes. Oh man, if we got like a stranglehold on this state, we're like a gigantic radio condom on the entire peninsula now. So I just want to tell you, I'm broke, but I'm happy. Well good luck to you, pal. Thanks. And have a safe trip. Bye-bye. Behold Junction. Did I mention that earlier in the day that like my whole life was like hinging on a call from Yahoo Junction and we got it. We got it. Here's a pig report. 156 to WIOD. We don't mind taking that from over on the West Coast, sir, but don't waste your time here, okay? It's just a disgusting and disgraceful, although perhaps true. Tamarack. Yes. Yes, sir. Neil? Yes, I am. I'll hire you. You'll sound great. I do sound great. Neil, I have something to tell you, I think you'll enjoy. I hope so. I've been out to call this the last week out there. They got a new revelation out there. And what did they got a young fellow out there that came from Cadbury down? Yes. The pain on each race is just fabulous. What is life in the Cadbury chocolate people? No, he's not Cadbury. Up in Minnesota, boy is that Yahoo track or what? This young fellow is good. They raised some of the non-elium up there right here. Let me tell you the type of winners that had gave out on his first pick, $39. Oh, $28. I'll take it. $24. All I want is one. He's second choice paid $50. He also picks the $5 horse and the thing that doesn't matter. Let me tell you what he does. He gives you what he does. He's a beast race. He analyzes why. He just don't like Jeff DeForce. You look at the problem. He gives you the first choice, the second choice. Right. Like Mark Lodas, in the top of the park, gives y'all that chalk. We want to drown in a sea of chalk, Mark. No, let's get a little guts in here. No, not only that, nobody tuned him out. Never listened to him. But this fellow now, he gives out horses and they're knocking the prices down. He's good. He gave out a horse yesterday that was $15 or $1. They had no chart on them. In other words, he came from Argentina. But he said it was a race down there. A horse out in the post that is doing well. And he meant, now, you've got to do your homework to know all this yet. Right. You've got to do it. It's good. He's doing it. And I'll tell you, they'll take him out away from me. He's too damn good. Well, I'm going to come out next Sunday just to make sure I don't accept. Really, you'll go out. I will. I'm going to bring hundreds of thousands just to make sure I don't accept. But think you same saw blocks out there. You'll have a good time. I'll do it. They'll go to good to speak to you. Thanks for the tip, pal. Okay, bye. Have a great day. Okay. There's our kind of guy. Our kind of guy right there, ladies and gentlemen, are we done? God, this was like a breath of fresh air, as they say. They're not saying that over there at the J.C. or are they? God. They don't know whether to attend the emergency meeting about this or the bankruptcy meeting first. What the hell's going to go on over there, man? And wait. So now they do their own news over there. Wouldn't it be great if they could hear fat Chuck Meira and we can magazine every Saturday morning? God. Then it would like really open up a whole new bunch of avenues to those folks over there in a West Coast. Thanks to like, uh, Engelwood and Angelbert and Johnny Meeter and all those people in Sea Bring, God, what a great place. So I had a von Park and Arcadia, which is where most of our audience hangs out on a weekend anyway. And Yeehaw Junction and Sebastian and where else? What am I leaving out? Come on, come on, Lakeland. Eljo Bean. Eljo Bean. Like I said, in St. Pete and Tampa and all those other glacier places. Have a great day and stay till it man. You think this was really crap, way to your Rick and Sudd. South Florida Zoo is traffic and weather stations. We're going to go 6-10 W-I-O-D. My happy footwater meal in the Palm Beach.
