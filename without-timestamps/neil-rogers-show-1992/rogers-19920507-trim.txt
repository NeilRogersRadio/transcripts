I don't tell me here's a couple like country and a wester. He just was going nuts. He couldn't control himself. We have an open line in Broward 524Wild and one in Palm Beach that's ringing as we speak. Wild the Palm Beach line. Yeah. Yeah. What's going on? How you doing? Man, you're just eating. What's going on? I just saw it ringing in George was in there checking out man he's butt. I cannot believe that. What's up? What are you doing? Nothing. I was just calling it out. That's going on. That's going on. Come to get on a hold. Well, I want to check out the ones from RCT for a few minutes. Quite a guy on the A. He's got a start on me. Why is that? I want to go back on hold. I have nothing to say. I have no material. Well, things up that holder. Okay. We have an open line in Broward. Now that's interesting. As we continue delving into the psychology of goofballs that call Talk Show's on a radio. I bet you there are a lot of people like that. They're just calling it and get on a hold and try desperately to think of something. Most of them obviously fail as you hear every day. Am I right, sir? Pretty much. Okay, hold on. Here's a mobile in Miami in our starline. Line lurking in our watch out for grade line, Alex. Look out. Okay, your time is up, sir. My time is up. It's time for you to stop thinking and start talking. Okay, last year I saw the brave and the cuff. I was going to take a break of twight in Atlanta. I just heard the county. I was going to school up there. And the first time I ever went to professional games. And I was feeling delighted with my girlfriend to get tickets. Wait a minute. Wait. What is that? What is this? For who? Who's that? I got to sign up. Picture here for Dave Grave Lyme. While I'm trying to do a show. And the hell would Dave Grave Lyme? Exactly. Oh, manny and Dave are doing something in the studio now. Okay, go ahead, sir. Anyway, we're listening. Keep your pants on, manny. Go ahead. What's going on over there? Yeah, that's what I'm beginning to wonder. Anyway, we got great seats. Some guy had an extra set of tickets in his wife. No guns allowed in a studio. Put that six shooter away, manny. Doug out. You know, above the cubs Doug out. First time ever. Yeah. The heart hits two home runs. Right on his horn. Yeah. They beat a 15 to two. I remember that game very vividly. It was a class. It was my first game ever. Yes, here I loved it. Okay. Yeah. Is that it? Thanks, please. Okay. All right. Yeah, it was not too good. Not too bad. Yeah. I love you. See you. 1242 at WIOD. Palm Beach. We have an open line. 655, 9463, 655, WIOD. Great line. Just pulled up his pant leg and the during the break for my immediate tell you what he has in there. Let's go to a pop in O. Hello. Deal. Yes, sir. I love you too. Yeah. I'm booked. Is that it? That's it. Boy, it's really something I have this many dates lined up. Here's a lady in Miami. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm okay. I have a question. Mm-hmm. I'm from Detroit in a major tiger fair. And my boss, unfortunately, is a major red dot fan. And we have this running argument over which stadium is better. And so we figured you could help us out. You know, there's no such thing as which stadium is better. Both stadiums are great. They're both, they're definitely a smaller. And it's, you know, got the remonstred all that. What's that echo coming from? Hold on a second, okay? Okay. Let's see when you rid of that echo. Is that better? Yeah, that's better. No, it's back. You know, it's a little bit different. Yeah. Well, anyway, and the tiger stadium is great because they're not a bad seat in the house. It's the foul lines are very close to the field. And I used to go there a lot. So they're both great. Okay. But there's no winning the argument. There's not one of those arguments you can win. It's like saying, which color is better? Red or green? I mean, it's, you know, matter of taste. It's a factor. Well, you know, this always took on Detroit. And I always had to stand up long enough. Well, tiger stadium, if I was going to pick a ballpark that's better in terms of being fair, the dimensions are better. I mean, the green monster in Fenway makes it kind of a freaky ballpark. So if you want to win the argument, that way. That was great. Yeah. He just put you off in the radio. Good. Cool hand. Let's go back to Beantown. Well, great. Thanks a lot, Neil. Tell him he's a man's hole. I definitely do that. Okay. And by the way, I love you, too. See you. Bye. Okay. What? 1244 George only wishes he had this many enduring people out there just following you to choose. Unfortunately, they're not on. Two upper lines, both in Broward, 524WIOD. You've got a thank you going on in the building here today. There's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Colorgram. From wherever. In fact, the telegram comes from New York, but he's here. So evidently, a secretary sent the telegram. Do New York and Florida listening to your show as usual and love it lost 59 pounds, 50 more to go. Would love to show off at the studio, give me a buzz, etc. And so, with his Florida number, now we love you. But don't hold your breath. It's 11 past 10 at WIOD. Also got a little more information yesterday. The guy called I felt bad about yesterday because he was serious. Want to know when we're going to do our trip in Chicago. That we do every summer. I don't know. I really don't. I'm not trying to give the guy a hard time. I know nothing. Because I work at 610 WIOD where a lot of energy is put generally into the wrong areas. So, Cheryl, I'm an all- I talked to Hank yesterday by the way. Hank tells me that the scoop is out from the national and others that Denver and Miami are going to get to major league baseball teams. And if we don't buy the way, we can pick up Houston for 100 million. No problem at all. The sisters can buy the team. Then we can carry the games, right? And get off these horrible awful talk shows where we have to sit here and beg for people to call. Hank and I can go out and he can buy the beer and I can do the baseball games. But anyway, Cheryl trapped me in the hallway out there yesterday at about 2.15 to tell me that the trip from 2. Chicago is on. It will happen, but it's still in the works. And that a lot of us are praying that we can go and we want to. Now, I hope Mike to Chelo from Midway Airlines is in town. I was driving out here one day a couple of weeks ago. I'm away home and he was out there also just happened to be passing me on the 79th Street, caused way waving and doing his usual little mouthy thing he was doing. You're a good guy, Mike. But we want to go to Chicago when it's convenient for us. And when we would like to go now, when you would like to be there and choose around us. We like seeing you once in a great while, but basically we don't go to Chicago to see Mike to Chelo. Is that a bad way to put it without her to spellings? We don't really care. Because we want to go when it's convenient for us. You know what I'm saying, Mike? So let's hurry up and get the thing put together and cut the crap. Anyway, it's probably past 10 to WIOD. We've already got some calls on the board there this morning. It'll be interesting to see if it's going to be like a regular Tuesday. And what the hell is this obsession with tiny accrues, man? Did you hear that? Somebody left me in my box the tape from yesterday's Rick and Sechio. Who is that? Who is that? Why are you rude? No, I'm your cruiser here. Wow! I'm trying to get crazy. I'm trying to get crazy. You're probably right or crazy. What I'm making a long story short, turned out it wasn't trying to cruise because tiny Cruise happens to be black and this is some white chick that wandered in the door. Putting on some kind of an imposter thing. Well, she's supposed to be one of those babes that they sent for your birthday. And I want to those things they do. Because they have an alley she kept her clothes on and they kicked her ass out when she found out it wasn't time to cruise her Sky 3 or Sky King even. There's trouble in Japan.

Is he doing a radio show on music sure at Talkshow? He is definitely beyond a shadow without a frustrated talk host. Maybe Bill Tanner's going to wind up like, uh, on right after B.D.L. over there on the lightball. We found the losers. Because he desperately wants to do a talk show. He don't want to do music. He don't want to play all that filthy punky stuff. Oh, you know what? We didn't do yesterday at all. Because I put it away and I can't find it. Oh, see. It's good thing I started thinking about power 96 because that's what always makes you think about dirty music immediately. I'm always laughing. Okay. We'll just keep that handy. Okay. Let's give those numbers out and see what goes on. Little TV history will be made at Ridley Field Monday night next Monday of 13th when three generations of carries. Harry's ship and ship settle into call a game between the Cubs and the Braves at Ridley. Is that incredible or what? In credible. Uh, 751 WioD and Dave 524 and Broward and the Starline is cooking at Star IoT in open line in Palm Beach. 655 WioD Miami. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. Do you know here at Terry personally? Do I know him personally? Yes. Does he know you? Yes. So, does he know that you do these bits and all that? Yeah. Has he ever heard of? I don't know. Okay. Last night on the news, Channel 7. Do you know what? Is there some significance to that? Well, you know, the guy's about ready to croak. I didn't know whether you could get him. Not about ready to croak. He's 170 years old, sir. Well, you know, doesn't look a day over 90. Last night, Jim Barry spoke to Jerry. Are you heard about that, right? No, sir. Channel 7 News. Listen to this, Neil. Let me give you a news update. Okay. Jim Barry's going to be calling all five cities for the next five days to speak with the local sportscaster about, you know, the possibility of getting the team. Last night, he spoke to Azar at the Buffalo. Azar comes on the news. Right away, says Miami's a lot getting. Don't even call anybody else. Miami's got the team. Well, he has a nose for sports. Are they good? I said he has a nose for sports. He has a nose for sports. Yeah. He had a lean head to a lady. There you go. Neil, how much was your trip to, uh, your affair to, uh, Las Vegas? Too much. Because I just called an airline to find out what the round trip was to, uh, Atlanta from Miami. Yeah. You know, I could go to Brussels for what they're charging out and go to. It was outrageous to have seen. It cost me more for the airfare than I lost in Vegas. We did it. I don't know if this will be the first time in Belzilla this. Yeah, yeah. Okay. 20 after 10 at W roasting, all three day lines are wide open. At one drop off, and bro, which means we got two calls on the board. This is going to be just like yesterday, isn't it? I don't care to make a bit of difference to me. Did yesterday, because I was really depressed about being back in town after Vegas. Today, I'm like back on the line this. Let's see, to make a bit of difference to us. Okay. If you call, fine. If you don't call, that's okay, too. If you're that bullish, if you're that boring, if you're that anti-social, let's talk about tiny crews for four hours. That seems to do it. I think that's where we're missing out. Don't you? Yeah, you weren't here. Yeah, yeah. It's better fact we're going to be going probably for a long time. Okay, we'll give it one on time to crew. On time to crew. On time to crew. Yeah. Yeah, this is the first time. What? This is not tiny crews. Who is this? He's not tiny. Yeah, who is this? So how what's the deal here, Marvin? Marvin our producer who's supposed to thoroughly screen everybody. Oh, the tiny crews. This is tiny crews. Warsher. Marvin, you're our producer. You open up in our reading and hearing a bomb. What's happening in town? Tiny crews. I have no idea what that's all about. I've never seen her. I bet you know, if anybody in the audience has ever seen her either. Okay, I'm going to give the numbers one more time before the break. 751 WI would deal with the deadlines or wide open and one in Broward is open. 524WI would do that during the break. We'll decide whether to play the rack or come back. Because today would be a good day to do it. Be kind of like a little reward to our listing audience. So they don't have to put up with these idiotic callers. Always on the main page. You seem to get a bad wedding. No, and you don't have to press me now. If you're a while in line, you're along with you. I'm not a good man. I'm not a good man. What an attitude. I've never thought before to be a soul with your business. You think it's a good idea when there's trouble. I get a call on you till you meet me on the side of the road. You call back when I hear you. I call it loud. So why am I coming with the sound? You're the best. Why am I in love with you? And I'll take you. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. When I see you, you're all alone. And I'm not a good man. I'll take you. I'll take you. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'll even give you back your time, call it even. Hey. When I'm alone, you're the best. You're the best. From the sound, you're the best. You're the best. I'll leave you. God gave me the ability to have teeth. I don't think you're as outside. Is that ditty about a bitty in my stomach? That's as old as 10, but she's sh'a, it's great to eat. I tell you, it's quite a pity. Let's put on a loan on social security. She got things and it's a true setup working by the door. Her brand new get up. She gets the default. She tries to call. I call. And I can't get out. I call. And I can't get up. You're imagining us, she wouldn't want to. I'm in tune. I feel you, you're me and the crew used to power that blue her. And now she's not allowed to dance. The drum her a way. And an Amber Wander. I get to come and see a bit of a bunch of. I'm full and I can't get up. I'm full and I can't get up. There's a painful fact about me, a rages you should know. That's a major cause of stiffness and swelling. I can't stop you, night. But just get to the light. Like a long, long couch. Going off the shot. I'm in a fuffin. And I feel you good. I think I'm like by the far. Hi, I'm Darrell Hall. You know, even though my hair looks really good and I got a great body. All the women really love me. I got a problem. Hi, cholesterol. So that's why I ate this new hall and note friends. You're in a hall and note brand cereal. Every taste to little flavors tastes like my partner John. Except they're bigger and they don't hold back my career. Anyway, before you've lost that living feeling, rock and roll with a healthy bowl of Hall and note brand. Hey, it's the only thing I like that is me. I'm a child old. As a milk and you have just some home old. Be a brand eater. Hall and note brand cereal from the makers of Guns and Raisins. Oh, have a bowl. Be a brave man. First, it took a little girl. Your mother serves locked in my heart. Then it possessed the priestness you my child. Now, it's taken over the refrigerator. Honey, would you like a little fuck, a little fuck, a margin on your mother's. What was that honey? I said you want some part hair. Honey, I think the top of the table just talked. You better believe it. The Metro Golden Marjorin presents, Exorcist 4, starring Molly McButter, and introducing Polyunsaturated as the tormented housewife. Honey, would you back the butter please? Right, it will never be the same. You will believe it's not butter, and it doesn't stop there. Hey, it's me, the handle. You're closer to me. As a sport, now melting at the Citadelplex 2, plenty of free parking. Come on, honey. Sometimes I feel myself. No, when it's white, and I know you're gonna feel it baby. No, it's here, it's time and so white. You'll pick the white one baby. No, it's here, it's lonely white, but a boat and your cage will be suitable. And they got no butter, but you picked the white one baby. Yeah, no white one baby. You know what it's white. You just got the face there. You got the white one baby. No, it's all right. You got the white one. I'm on this, it's completely pot-burdable. Very uncomfortable and lovely, full of bones. You picked the white one baby. 1033, at W.Y.OD. We've only played like what? We've only played like 3,000. No problem at all. We might even play the asshole song through that in there too. That feels about 3.5 minutes. That's the way it is, folks. This is the week that was started last week, like after a Monday, like noon on Monday. And now it's working into this week. This is the month of May that the South Florida audience killed it, buried it for the big shovel. That's okay. A lot of time, a lot of spots too. 27-11-W-Y-O-D. Let's play some. 1033, at W.Y.OD. Here's Andrew Dice Clay for Dicerone. All right, let's say you're eaten. You're sick and ****ing tired of ****ing potatoes. And that stole top ****. Do like me, honey. Eight days. Dicerone. Come on, it's almost as simple as you. Put up ****ing bag and the ****ing pot. And you turn on the ****ing stove. You think you can manage that honey? Hey, put up being the ****ing things done. Stop. Remember, Yankee Doodle came the town. Right, none of Phony. Stop up for the raw fish. That **** said called it thyserone. Oh, no, no, no, no. That's how you do the street out. I saw a lot of them with cookies and cream. I'll be so hard to chew. Just on their days. Thank you. I quit it all. Wait, do I dare with no tomorrow, though? I'm getting real cold, so that's being hard to say. I don't know. I don't know. Everybody else, they're not too damn fat. Do we even touch my cell? Oh, I don't know. Everybody else, don't know. Oh, no, no. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I don't want cookies and food coming. I don't want to buy all the ice. Don't want to stop. I'm daylight munchin'. Let's have a piece of that pie. I go by, I've been dreaming for grind. I'll change up the year and downs when you need to. I'm rolling around and I'll be played up a ton. I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running. Oh, I don't know. Everybody else, they're not too damn fat. Do we even touch my cell? Oh, I don't know. Everybody else, don't know. Oh, no, oh, oh. I don't know. I don't know. Everybody else, they're not too damn fat. Do we even touch my cell? Oh, I don't know. Everybody else, don't know. Oh, no, no. Oh, no. I don't know. Everybody else, they're not too damn fat. Do we even touch my cell? Oh, I don't know. Oh, keep up the rules coming. I don't know. I don't know. I'll be high. I don't know. I'm feeling unconcious. Let's have a piece of that pie. I'm getting ready to keep things going up the stream. Oh, you were saying? He's talking to me. This thing is ending. George is hiding me a China about how Brian McGurrey was just on a hotline. Looking for a job. Get out of here. Will you give me a break? Lock the doors. Nail everything down. Okay, 1041 at WOD. Did that interrupt the flow of the whole goddamn thing here? I'm sitting here having a good time. What a painless Tuesday. And this yutz in here is talking to me. I can't even hear the card ending. Oh, man. Brutal. Brutal. For a lot of day, are you there? Yeah. You're still there? Go here. Well, that's incredible. Yeah. Only homebo's go to Vegas. Yeah. Okay. That's why he waited all that time. He's probably been there about six times this year. Palm Beach is gone. Lady and four lotterdales got to be gone, right? No, I'm not. You're still there. Yeah. Okay. You know, I heard that you went to Las Vegas. Yeah. We spent all day on that yesterday. We don't want to talk about the day. Oh, I'm coming from Las Vegas. Yeah. And I love it. I'm because somebody else says they don't like it. Well, I'm sorry. I do. I don't know why I waited for my son. That was 10 Harrison on the phone just now. That previous call, I don't worry about him. No, he's upset because it hurts his cruise ship business. Oh. Well, I don't know why I waited so long to move out to Las Vegas. Oh, I see. I see. It's a great place. Yeah. That's all I wanted to say. Okay. Okay. Thanks so much. All right. She would have been the town is dried up folks, it's history. They got nothing left to say they've said. That's the problem when you got people like Tanner on Power Doont Talk shows in the morning. There's only so much that people are got to say and they've said it. In fact, they've said it many, many times. Have you noticed that many, many times over and over ponderous. Really ponderous. This is a clicking line. Listen. Hello. Hello. There's a voice on here. Oh, my God. You could knock me over with a feather duster. Yes, sir. Okay. I wanted to. Unless something straight your day in the Sierra the executive bathroom. Why? The executive bathroom card. What the hell is that? What is what the hell is that? The executive bathroom card. Yeah. Now that card's not in here anymore, you know that. Oh, I didn't know that. Long gone. Come on now, somebody erased it? It's in the dumpper. Oh, well. Can't win them all. Yeah. Ciao. Okay, but. Ha ha ha ha. See what I mean? Absolutely. Now I was noticing and that this is not a shot of Rick and Suds because like I said, the twangering in the middle of the space shuttle landing was the greatest moment to your radio, although the tiny cruise thing is getting a little ponderous. But I've noticed that there could be a cutting the colors on Rick and Suds also to about like remember you ever go June were you hear that? Now you weren't here were you? You were when Irvie call was like, but load back at you remember that? And I said, hey, wait a minute. This is, you know, a little fun, but it's got to be a little something more than that with these colors. And now it's like a double back flip up your nose but loads. And it seems like it's basically that am I right? Isn't that what I'm most of the colors got to say and that's about it. Triple cherry fudge Hawaiian pancake buttload and back at you. See that. And that's what our audience is kind of like degenerated. I mean, it's just nothing left. They have nothing left to say. It's like anything else. I mean, it's like in a restaurant if they don't keep resupplying sooner or later they run out of food. Underwear sooner or later they all get like crusty. You don't go out and get new ones. They all run out of, you can't use them anymore unless you want to start slipping those mal-oterus musty Flatiss events like a one-on-a-plane I talked about yesterday. But seriously, the audience in this town, of course, there nobody here anyway. Even coming out 79, street again today, I noticed very. Did you have any account of much traffic? Nothing. You could just fly through there about 90. Let's go out to sky one now at Miami International and check out United Flight number 402. I think it's landing right now. Let's go to check my or my international see if we get a safe landing or. What everybody in the media is waiting for? Good crash. 1045 at WIO D boy, you could like I said knock me over with a feather. Lady Mobile? In North Miami, she's not there. Is she? Now she's gone. She's such a mighty out of the car for a second. She's a curry. Oh, she's a courier. Well, let's put her back on hold. Okay, likely story. Mobile in Boka? Hey, now. Yeah. Did everything like Rick and Suts could bring your show down. What the hell is that supposed to mean? What the hell do you think it means? I know who this is too. I know who that was. That's your buddy. That's what we got left. We got Mr. G. We got the homo from Vegas and that's about all we got left in the sun. You know, I'm coming to work this morning and it was incredible. It's amazing what kind of a pound this is. I'm coming to work. There were more people honking and waving and recognize me and the car this more coming to work. And I felt really great about that. They were like all alive. You know, I'm the age of 500. Even a car had a manatee county license plate. Full of people. I don't know who the hell they were. And they had waving and just a puke and an shortling and back on you. Triple banana cheesecake but loads. And then I come in here and it's just like the whole town is dried up. They've all gone off to the Bahamas to Crystal Palace. Is he back? Hello. Hello. Oh, you're there. Where were you when I needed you? I was making a pickup. Well, excuse me. Yeah. Well, I'm glad I got to talk to you. Yeah. First time calling. Uh-huh. Enjoy yourself. Sure. And time a woman listener. And I do like you. What over here?
