Now, here's Neil Rogers on News Dog Radio. 610 WIOD. Yes, sir. Yes. I'm wondering that, when are you talking about these figures? About what? I'm talking about earlier. About what? Biggest cars and boats. Now, we're talking about bridges over the caused way, not the ones in your mouth. I don't have any of my friends. Okay. Okay. Yeah. On Downs Road, I get deep in that. Danny. I'm a regular buddy, you're 90s Corbin, you're near. You got to give me. No. Well, it is. All bridges over 9-able WIOD away. If I knew that, I wouldn't have been asking, sir. What's that? I said if I knew the answer to the question, I wouldn't have asked it in the first place. Okay. Well, I'm saying sir, here's that P. The 90s-Stage Corbin can hear us on a lunge that regulate bridges over 9-able WIOD away. Over one. 9-able WIOD away. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. So it's up to them to decide what time the bridges should not be open to the marine traffic. Yes. And what time should they not be open to marine traffic, sir? I'm telling you that they come up with a time. Well, what is the time? I believe it's that wish hour times, sir. That they are not open to marine traffic. Other than that, they are open to marine traffic. So in other words, any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for seeing on. I'm absolutely correct. Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crafters there? That is not a communist bunch of claps. Sounds like some kind of reandestall connections to Tommy Pickle. You got five points in the middle. You'll be able to run boat. Right. Exactly. How did boat is going to stop for 5,000 cars? That it? No, I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat. I think that's what they ought to do. Man, you better know your law is Mr. Because you sure don't. That's right. I suppose you want the damn bridges close to both traffic and American two. I want the bridges closed period. I want them closed. I want the bridge headed to go home and watch the MTV and get the lot of our lives. I want those bridges closed. Let them use the Julia Tuttle, okay? Let them use the Maconza Cosmo. I think they all ought to go out of George Washington, Bridg and jump all of Bridg tenders. How do you like that, sir? Well, I don't know about you, but you shot like some stupid idiotic touch. Okay, 12.08. We're in Orlando. Man, this is so exciting. I'm just ready to have like an emotional accident. One time call or first time listen there. Great. I've been over to Luce before. Not much there. Wait a minute. You've been over in Luce. I wouldn't been over there, sir. Yeah, I got like a real quick though. Don't drop the soap. Oh, good chicken wings there, though. Really? Yeah, crazy wings. I bet you there are some neat people in Luce and I'm going to put out the Luce challenge in the days to come to hear from some really living and breathing people who are obsessed with their nose picking music to the point of absolute hysteria like that one guy. And then some Luce is kind of like an Indian town in the Lantana, Chloe Stenolk. All wrapped up in one big ball of momma. One big schmock. Yeah. Listen, have you ever done that? One big schmock. No, I'm Irish, so I don't know. Okay. South of Kilargo is a bar called Woody. Have you ever been? We can't say Woody on the ear here anymore. Okay, but have you been to there? No. Do you have a favorite and go? There's a group called Big Dick and Extenders. Not the plug-it. But I've been there a couple of times. I think you might enjoy it. Great. Good rock and roll and good comedy. Don't listen. Guys, just make us a suggestion. Sure. When you're in Luce and you go in like in the little soda shop or whatever it is, don't play that on the jukebox. Don't play that. Don't play a big dick in the Extenders on the jukebox. I'm just a suggestion. I mean, it's a free country, at least in certain parts, but don't do it. You might make him friends. They're well, it's possible. Friends and low places also. Right. Well, and I hear the sheep are friendly. They're anyway. That's what that guy said. I'm from South Florida, Boca, Tony originally and very happy to hear you up here. Well, spread the word for us, sir. I sure will. When it doubts, spread it out. Have a good one. And you, too. Bye-bye. Boy, this has been in just three days. Can you imagine what's going to happen in about a month? We are going to begin. We're going to have to have like 75,000 phone lines. We're going to have like phone lines from a hell from Yahoo Junction to Yamama. Is that it? No, what is it again? Why, Mama? Why, Mama not to be confused with Yamama. And every place in between, it's more than I can take for a lot of day. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Did you read the paper here about share of supporting quits? How old steam has dropped the soap? He said no more for me. Well, that's it. I'm not buying no more screw magazines for the late night. See, I don't blame you. And see, you've been up to pop and you don't want to happen to old gold steam. You remember years ago, he made that very, very bad porno movie with, Who's that real old, dike that was a little more. Gloria Leonard, remember that? Well, you're lucky if you never saw that. Because I mean, he makes a Ron Jeremy look careless. I mean, that was like a human furball. He is. He's got here in places where it's illegal and browned. And everything's up to pop and I'm. Yes, sir. Make it any money or no? We're holding our own if you know what I mean. They call it shepherd. Right. Kelly Shepherd has put on display this summer that I wouldn't wish on the entire Nazi army. Okay. He made a drive on a horse around revenue neutral on Saturday night that was so bad That even Donald Brainer was chuckling in the paddock. How do you like that? Well, when he goes upstairs early to back, what can he say? No, can I tell you, sir? But, uh, you know, one more thing. John and Gene, uh, can you check to see if it's blowing yet? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Kelly Shepherd has put on a display that even looked barnahm is embarrassed by. But hey, it's all your race. We have an open line on, uh, no, we don't. They're just smoking man.

Oh it's on the Gulf. It's where the New Yorker is. Oh so how do we play? Wait a minute. You say between Orlando and the Gulf. Orlando is like in the middle of the state. Exactly. I'm 15 miles from Orlando and 50 miles from Crystal River. So you're like right smack dab in the middle of the deck. All right. The New Clear Power Plant. Crystal River. Great. So in other words you just stick your head out to window and you get like ready. You get like. Yeah. Well no no. I'm a waste. I'm 50 miles from here. So you know it has to really have a big meltdown. When it's got to be blown in the right direction. Exactly. Listen Neil. I heard you talking about Frank Glasgow earlier. Right. He does a state morning show up there on cool 105.9. He does the show. He's the news guy. He's a news guy. Right. He's a great news guy. He's a good friend of mine. He's been up there for a while now. Right. Right. Now does he know that I'm on on S.U.N. Because I don't call him tomorrow and you know everybody. Well what do you mean tomorrow? Or you mean tomorrow morning? Tomorrow morning. Yeah. Would you like me to you know give me a little message? Of course. Tell him do a call on some media live that sooner. So we can find out what's going on up there. Well I sure will. I'll give him the number and tell him the call. That's a damn good station he's on by the way. Oh it is. I listen to it especially on the weekends. Who 105.9. It's you're better than any old East station we got over here. Oh, I'll ask you that. Oh man. Oh, it's wax. You haven't listened to waxing. Oh, I will say this waxing is much up a little bit. They're playing better music. I hate to admit it, but they're doing a little better. Well my friend has been from sweet orders and sending me clips from you. You know, from your show. Well now you don't need any more. Now I don't need it anymore. Exactly. Right. And I like to say give him a douche bag salute if you don't mind. He's been sending your roach clips from Davy. No. You ought to see what they smoke in Davy man. Well his name is Billy and he works for Jainty air conditioning. Right. And I'd like to say he's a warm and a dish bag. Before they smoke it in Davy, it's got to pass through their horse first. Oh, I believe me. Well, you have a great day. And I'm glad you're up here and I don't have to listen to you on tape anymore. Right. You can catch your lives. Well, I'll spread the word for us. Go down to the dairy queen near and write some numbers on the wall or something. Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll tell Frank you'll be called. Do it. Thank you. See you. Lady Lake. Man, can you believe this? I'm just stunned. I'm astonished. I don't know whether the screamer read like 45 bananas or Chiquita. It is so amazing. I know most of you said, we don't care. We're not in her. Well, I am. Okay. So just have to humor me for a few days until the novelty wears up. I like it. I mean, I like it a lot being able to reach out and I understand that WIOD is got a pretty good signal generally speaking if okay fair. I mean, like kind of weak. Media ochre. But now we feel more like the light bulb here on IOD. Now they were here at about S.U.N. just like, yeah. I mean, they've got a devastating. They're only like 10 kilo cycles apart from us on a dial. But they have that 10,000 non directional thing sticking right in the water over there in the bay. And that creates this enormous. I mean, they're probably using like half of the elatic ocean as their ground system or at least a go. So I wouldn't be surprised. When we start getting the calls from like France and Amsterdam and all those other places then we'll know they got a signal. Okay. Then you guys over there can start playing Butch Boss. 1221 on Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD. First from this program, I'm not necessarily those in 610 WIOD. I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers.

Okay, 1226, W.I.D. When we get our first call from Canon Day, when New York then I'm going to know we're on the map. Okay, I'll tell you that. Wouldn't that be something if we did? Oh, we're over here on the lake. And it's just a bounce and right across the lake on 620. All of a sudden, we at W.I.D. feel very like inferior. You know, like we got like we got some little jerseble back there in a transmitter. Grinding out about two lots or something, man. Or we week or week. And we're proud of it. Dear field. Yes, sir. I've been on Lysser about three years. Yes, it's past three days. The best. The greatest three days. These are the greatest three days of my life. I'm serious. This is so much them fun. I know. We needed a little change. I did. That's all a little variety. I keep talking Orlando that a little variety is an all bad. For our corresponding celebrity in Lysser. Could you please throw up on them? No, in Lysser. Oh, yeah. Did you say Lysser is going to get all that out of shape now? Get him. Because he's a nitpickering and those pick. Get him. What happened to my puked card by the way? Don't tell me all of a sudden you're taking my card. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. We got him. Ever great at it. And you too. 1227 and W.I.D. Was that the first puk on W.S. you went? Hey, if you heard some of that music they were playing. Believe me. There were a few around. I'm sorry. I shouldn't say that. Even though it's true. We have an opalide in Broward and the center of square five two four and at Bellsoth mobility line. I want to get something going on there. You know what I'm saying? I mean, if Larry Mervis was able to call us from up by E.H. Junction on the Bellsoth mobility line and it sounded real good by the way all it was off the ear. All you folks who were driving around up in them parts like all I mean, I'm sure not on a West Coast. They got general tell over there in a West Coast. That is the worst phone company in history. When I work in Sarasota, I used to broadcast high school football and baseball and stuff and basketball. And we'd go out to do a ball game and general telephone. We'd show up to do the game and they say, All guess what? We forgot to put your line and you little things like that. And we'd have to get like a megaphone and scream we're allowed. And I remember I did one ball game out of my car on the phone. Seriously, I did one, I did a football game out of my car, a high school football game. And it was really great. Hi, Alia. They'll get a real good perspective looking across the field that way. Yeah. First they want to say, how about them, Reds? What do you mean by that? Hey, you're a bit... They might have lost a few, but they're still in first place. We have, but you're hanging out by one game by one skinny little game. Hey, and only takes one to win. No, you're right about that, but the brave you got to admit, you got to admit they're kicking some phenomenal ass. Well, they beat the Reds this week, three out of four games. Yeah, they're pounded a crap out of the Giants last night. Hey, Danny Judger's not doing so bad. Yeah, wait till tonight. Wait till tonight. We'll be swallowing those words, man. I'm telling you, he is an accident waiting to happen. We've gone back into our coma phase. We can't hit the ball out of the NFL. Luis Salazar should have quit two years ago. We're just really sad. I'm embarrassed for the cup. I am. We're pathetic. And well, A Neo. But at least we'll make the Metz fans happy. You know they had like... They're averaging like 23,000 a game. And last night I think they had about 18,000. And the Yankees had brought about 12,000 again. The New York team's manner can't draw flies. No, they even...the jet had to leave... Right. Right. They could cover the field with a manure and they couldn't draw flies. And quite frankly, if you watch the Metz and Yankees, I think they've already accomplished that. Yeah. Hey, Neo. You know, I moved down to Miami about three years ago. Yeah. And I'm from Georgia. Georgia. Yeah, well, I'm Yahoo's from. Yeah. Not Aintree. Oh, that's not bad. Yeah, it's a nice place. Yeah, it's a beautiful place to drive through, like on a way to out of town. Well, if you blink, you'll miss it. Right. And... Wait a minute. I'm thinking of some place different. What's on the East Coast of Georgia as you're driving up 95? Savannah? Savannah. Savannah's nice. Oh, it stinks. Like I said, it's a crappy place. It's that place thinks a paper mosa. No, no. I'm not talking about how it smells, but it just looks like a nice, you know, Well, it's a nice place to visit. Brad, a nice and drive through it about 150 in your vet. Yeah. Well, but anyway, you know, today I was reading the in the paper about, uh, just, You mean, women, you mean you're from Vel Doste and you can read? Yeah, man. Wow. You overcame it. Hey, all right. But I was reading this thing about discrimination. And you know, it's funny. I'm from Georgia. Right. And, but down here, they talk about more about discrimination that I've, that I've seen in Georgia. Yeah. You know, and, um, I have a friend of mine down here. And I can't believe he, he would be the one who's, he does not, I'm a Hispanic. Yeah. I'm Cuban. And, uh, How could you tell? Uh, you're right. Oh, I know you can tell. I don't want to go into that. Yeah. Too personal. Yeah. I know. I know. I was born originally. I was born in South Miami. Oh, you're born here. Yeah. But I learned in Georgia. So then you must be circumcised. Yeah. Okay. How did I know that? No, you know, my father listened to Georgia. My parents were divorced. Right. And I lived with him for a while. But where was your father born in Cuba? No, New York. Oh, in New York. My mother was born in Cuba. Well, then he must be circumcised, too. Yeah. You guess. Okay. Anyway. But um, I think I threw you off a little bit. Yeah. You were reading something about discrimination. Yeah. I was reading something about discrimination. Right. And my friend down here, you know, he's Jewish. Yeah. And the comments he made to me about Hispanics. He just does not like them. Then why do I help those who live in Miami? Right. If he doesn't like it. Hitler treated the Jews better than he treats his father. So what is his problem is you maybe he needs to move to, uh, loose. He needs to move to Damage. He needs to move. He needs to move up the entry and they can chase his ass up into wood, so to speak. Yeah. He's a, yeah. He's a dirt spag. They'll teach him a lesson or to believe me. I know. They'll change his altitude real fast. I know. Well, me or one point. I can't deal with these bigots here. I'm telling you, people are people. You don't know. I mean, there's some horror like nice and similar or crappy and some in between. And some of our circumsides and some of them checked yet, but people are people. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think he's a racist or anything. No, that's just he just a damn bigot is what he is. Yeah. Just a bigot is a little up in head is what he is. He needs you to beat the crap out of him. I'll do it. All right. Hey. When last thing, try go. Yeah. Then Reno's got. Okay. The owner. 1233. This is like it's like the. League of Nations of radio. You know what I'm saying? I mean, here's a guy. He's from Valda, Georgia. He circumsized. He's got a Jewish friend who's up in the hills and a entry. Me and chasing that baby around. We got like, uh, Oka. Oka, Humpka. Hello. Neil. Are you cereal? Hey, are you doing? Oka, Humpka. Yeah. A little nowhere. This is my all time fantasy is a collar from Oka, Humpka. Do you know why? Why that?

I listen to you all the time. And I couldn't believe when I listened to the radio this morning. There you were shocking. Is it? I'll tell you. Now let me ask you. Oka, Humpka is where it's just about 30 miles south of Oka. Oh, it's up by horse country again there. Yes, sir. I saw all the guys get real friendly with their house. Right. And there she.

So no bank on North Miami Beach and the Frank is dating P3. All right. Have a great day. Thank you now. Bye-bye. Oka, Humpka, man. Are we doing it? Or what? Don't forget Rick and Sides has acted on Voice Coach. Dr. Morton Cooper maybe can help Rick get that the snout out of his nose. Because. No, because Rick always has that real nasal sound sound like he's like sucked up and his nose too. Dr. Morton Cooper the voice guy and the top 10 tabloid trash headlines and the wheel of meat and man you people who are like new listeners now. When you hear Rick Riley pound that meat on this table.

I've been calling me though for the last two days last and at all. Well, that's great. We love it. You're not going to ask me where I'm at. It says passenger. That's right. What is the same you're ever? On the Kassimi River near What? Well, we're east to Sabre and North Bokichobi. Oh, man. Talk about between a crock and a heartplace. You're just like jammed right in there, aren't you? Yeah. All right. But I went and lived down in the Sardine camp again for nothing. Not a blame. Were you all right? No. We wouldn't either. In fact, once we get this perfected, we're going to like move to Vegas and do the show on a satellite. Hey, how about that? That sounds good to me. Hey, also, I got to stay high to my mom and dad down in Cluston. I never probably driving on their way home. All right. From Davey. What y'all have a good day now? Y'all too. Bye-bye.

You know who called Dickens Scott the other day. But a certain this to hell. Did you know that? I was so far behind the time. Sir, not only did I hear it, we talked to him yesterday. Oh, did you? Yeah. Okay. I'll change in history. Why? Abraham Lincoln, with Sean. Yeah. You're that's right about the same league. I have a great day. Bye. Well, he's in West Palm. What do you expect? He's way to help me hide man. He's like waiting for George Washington to pull his teeth out of the glass. Because if you leave those wooden teeth in a glass too long, man, especially at the early bird, we have an open line on a starline. It's ringing as we speak. We hope it's from like real far away. Like beyond Palm Beach. We pray. We hope open line in Broward. Five, two, four. Here's wait a minute. That they're gone. Inglewood. Neil, hello. Yes, sir. This is downtown Inglewood, Florida. Better known as Rinklewood. Home of the old folks. All right. Civilizations come to the third world. Right. Listen, free. Free prune juice, Santa must pray everybody in Inglewood on us to sift in on sir. I'll tell you what is a transplanted Miami. And I used to drive across the alley until I, you faded out. They thought is in Inglewood, ready for Neil and Sally are. You know, I think our first call on the 800 line on Monday was from Anglewood. How do you like that? Is that right? Is that shocking or what? I think it's just a whole lot of fun to hear on a radio. And also your compatriots over there because there isn't a hell of a lot to do over here except watch the grass grow. Just like here, right? Well, I'll tell you what though. It's got some saving graces. I haven't had to put up with any eye to come. You need to free them fighters. Uh-huh. You're set up for his brother. Yeah. And it only has to carry gun. Really? Yeah. Well, you might want to think about it if you head up to lutes. Uh, the only trouble with it is is you got to like old people. Uh-huh. Because all of you have fled for your end of the world. They're fled for the end. Yes, sir. Well, who can blame him? That's where it's at is the end. Now, by Neil, I'm so glad that they put you on a satellite over here. And I wish you a thousand pounds of luck with this market because we sure need you. We're kicking some assurances. Just three days, we've revolutionized this entire state. I'm going to tell you what. I think that the car radio is going to jump back to him. I don't know why they've got John and night though. It's a whole lot more fun listening to you. Well, it's a replay. It fills up four hours in the prices right. It's cheap. Yeah, but the yo yo that they got on during this time period is nothing right home about. What do you mean by that? You got the replay at night. Yeah. Are you also on live at this time? Well, where are you listening to me at? Over my telephone. I'm in the shop. We don't have any. No, we're live right now over there. Run from 10 to 2 and 6 to 10. I give you double whammy. Right. Two to the price of the on. I got you on the way home. It's how I found out about it. You can get us on a way in and on the way home and on the way out. How do you like that? I think it's just Andy. All right. Neil, have a nice life in a great day. And you too. Bye bye. Well, we'll confuse there. He's okay. We can rip him because he's not listening. Here's a lady in Atlanta. Yeah, lady in Atlanta. Bitch, who the hell are you? No, you can't. No, Kehoney. I'll lady in Atlanta. Probably a lady in Aintree. Okay? Who's rolling around in the woods with Ned Bady's cousin. We have an open line in date, 7519463. Now, see, I shouldn't be saying that. I'm confused. How to deal with this thing? Because we've done a little of sub-to-fusion of phone lines to weed a lot in some more of the trucks on the 800th thing there, which is work magnificently well. And I guess if I would have just kept my mouth shut or continue working fine. Hi, Alia. Neil. Yes. I'm going to say that I'm not, I can understand anybody's political feelings. I really don't care one way or the other, but I'm writing down, or 41 the other day. And I've passed real castle. Yes. Okay. Don't start laying Sheriff Nick Grabbed My Door. Okay. I can't be responsible for Wayne Arnold's right wing. I love shirt Nick Kramer. I don't believe it. There's your name. And I still insist that he gets my picture in my name a lot farther away from that crap about Sheriff Nick and his lovely wonderful wife. So now he has Nazi burgers. He has Gestapo burgers. I could. It was amazing that he really feel that way or something. Yes. He is a Sheriff Nick loving police gun-toting, loving right wing. I, that's just him, you know. And I keep that baton of free years weighing you make great food. We love your food, but keep your politics to yourself because it makes most of us puked. And makes those, it makes the white hots come from the bowels of my existence and popping out of my brains again. I thought my cookies and stuff right on by. That's right. How did you enjoy the Shayna Alexander book? I'm still reading it. I couldn't have been that good. No, I just, it was that I started about three books at the same time and that was one of them. No, actually I think it is very good. What was the name of it? Not cracker or something like that. Something like that. It's crack. Yeah. No, I think it's pretty good. All right. I'm saying it for my next plane trip like to a lutes. Well, next time you have the Nazi burgers delivered, let us know. It has like a cute little insignia on it by the way. You gotta see the way. Yonan, the Nile burger. You gotta see the little insignia they make with the bacon strips. You mean they have a great day? The man is what? See ya. Bye. I just got to see. They don't want to listen. I said you ought to see the cute little design they make with the bacon strips. You can envision that, can't you? Sure. That's why they call it hotel cut. As in cut the crap. Open line of date, county 751-946-34-Lauderdale. Hello. Hello, once? See, there's nobody on this line, but you know, the good part of it is we needed a deadline to feel like because if somebody would have been on there, it would have been really gross. Because we don't have time to do justice as they say in Atlanta. So we wouldn't have had time to talk to you anyway, so thanks so very much for having the kindness and decency to hang up and get out of our face, you idiot. Anyway, we'll come back for one more hour from 105-2, and then of course they carry to get an issue when from 6-10 at night because it fills up a lot of free hours. And because it's so damn good and also because it pisses off a lot of people in luts who just can't believe it's coming back at you again. Don't forget, Rick and Suds at 2, and they're finally, they've been working out all week, and they now that they are getting over their initial nervousness and psychosis.

I'm a nephew of that from your question this morning. I couldn't answer. I hope you can help me out. Okay. He said a friend of his, his friend father got a fishing license. He said, what is the purpose of the fishing license? What is the purpose of the fishing license? What is the purpose of it? Yeah. I don't know what it's for. What is the purpose of a driver's license? What is the purpose of the license to cross the street? Right? Well, it's another fascist government intrusion into your life is what it is. You should tell them. So it's just that. It's the government's way of giving you permission to put those live crabs and worms and living things on the end of a real sharp hook and then stick them in the mouth of a living creature and inflict as much pain on it as possible. That's what it is. It really serves no purpose. No, it's legalized murder is what it is. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Go, Ken, glad you got a good answer for him. I'm 27 at WIOD, an open line at Broward 524. Miami. Neil. When is this? Hi, this is Dave and Miami. Yes, Dave. Listen, I'm a virgin collar. Really? I started listening to you at work. Yeah. I'm originally from Lakeland. You sound like a virgin collar, Dave. I really do. I'm originally from Lakeland. I got some friends over there at Florida. I explained a lot, though, does that? I'm telling you. Listen, I got my experience for driving and learning how not to get killed here in Miami by the streets and stuff to get so angry, you know. In Lakeland, I was still in Lakeland when I got this experience. I was sitting in a red light next to a big, huge plummet and I look over and I see a nice little lady. Look over on wave at her immediately. She didn't want to look. She was afraid. There were a couple of my friends in the car. I just wave at her. I'm going to say, I know. Check this out. Next thing I know. We're driving along. I hiked my horn out or I want to wave at her again. I'm just being silly, whatever. She pulled the gun on me and rolled for window down. So I learned not to mess with people. Don't mess with those friendly folks in Lakeland, sir. Okay? I'm telling you the only thing I learned of it there. She's probably from Auburndale. Right. Not to screw with people and that cow tipping is the only thing they know how to do over there. You bet. Listen, can I call someone to do that? And shooting people like you, Dave. That's the other thing we know how to do. Right. Right. Can I call someone to do speck? Yes, Dave. I want to call my boss, Michael. It clown, pushing, cold, wet, douchebag. Okay. Thanks a lot and you'll have a good day. And we'll see you later. Bye-bye. 1, 29 at WIOD. The out of town line is an, I don't know how to do this. I'm confused. Well, just whatever it is.

You see the thing with the John Goddy verdict. And all these people are trying to push the car over and there's screaming and they're carrying on and they're throwing bricks. It's just the American way, you know? It's just the way we, I think that Mayor Daily was right. That's just the way we do things here now. Okay. Like after the bulls won a championship. We just, if we get upset about something, if we're happy about something, we just go out. We start like, carry it on, man. We just like go nuts. Right, a control. Speaking about a control.

They call back Nordiques, rhymes with geeks. Yeah. Because there are a bunch of imbosals, they traded him to the Philadelphia Flyers. However, after they consummated that trade, if I can say that, the New York Rangers made him a better deal. So then they turned around and they traded him to the Rangers. And it's in the hands of the league. Okay. Who's his watt and which parts they get and where they put him, etc. It's a bunch of crap. Okay. It's exactly what you expect from a bunch of French Canadians. I see. That's a blind man. Right. The one thing I do know is that the Leafs ain't getting them. Okay. That I know. Okay.

Just barging around here like he owns the damn place. I got news for you. Anybody that puts the moon scope guy on on statewide needs mental help immediately. Here's a lady in candle. Hello. Hi. I want to ask you a question. Yes. I had a lady die come over to coin. You had one? Yeah. It was a coin. The comrade of coins that came out when Lady Diana. Well, who gives a crap about her? Well, I don't care. All that constipated royal family over there that the British can't grow up and get over you mean? Yeah. Well, I don't think there's that bad. Oh, they're ridiculous. They're like a bunch of old-grown school kids with a queen and the prince and the princess. That's like a fairy tale. Okay. They got to come into the real world. Well, you know the queen's. They're going to be there. And they're wearing that princess Diana's depressed. I know. I know. Well, if you were married to a geek like that, you'd be depressed too. Well, I don't want to discuss that. You got weird like Dumbo. I want to discuss the coin that I saw. Well, what do I know about it? Well, you don't know about it. I know nothing about it. What do I know about coins? I guess you can't answer my question then. Well, I'm awfully sorry. Are you upset? No. Well, that's good. I'm not either. I'm not a big day. Bye. Dumbo. 141 and WI. Why isn't that ridiculous? She's going on. What does this show have to do with her princess die coin? Okay. God. If you wouldn't have stood up, maybe you wouldn't have lost it. We have an open line in date. 751. Well, what are you? I mean, people are right in the middle of this show. And she's called asking, like, where is that? Is the new man, the new mismanagement is there, the coin man? I have this old Indian head thing that I've been rubbing for hours here. Here's my Emmy. Hello. Hello. I'm Tony George. This bunch this hour. I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Kimler. Sarasota. Neil. These people are incredible and they're picking on you folks, sir. How do you like that woman with her princess die coin? Didn't she hot? Man. Thank you. If I believed it, then I would thank God that I heard your voice again on the radio. Really? Yes. I've been up here since October, 91. Wow. I've had a withdrawal system symptom ever since. Even Ted Bundy never had a sentence like that. Now you know why they call it sorry, Soda. How is there for a year, man? I tell you, I'm sorry, believe me. The median age is like 100 years past death. Sorry, Soda. Yeah. That's right. I'm sorry, Soda. I will say one thing though. You know the one thing I do miss when I was in Sarasota. They had some damn good restaurants over there. I bet you. Really? There was a German, a place that had a German smorgas board. I can't think that it's probably long gone. There's just... There Dutchman? Was that it? I don't know. I don't know. I think it was the old Heidelberg. The old Heidelberg? I don't know. Do you remember that German smorgas board place in Sarasota? Oh God, that was good. That was the, well was it was the old Heidelberg? Is it still there? It's still there old man. I'd go over there just to eat there with all my good buddies from like lutes and tarp and springs. We could just head under the sheets. I never know. And then leave the shoes you don't want to be in. Right. Well, please. I hope this is permanent. It is forever, sir. Believe me. I sure leave. All these Yahoo's from FLA that are calling with all these phony threats. Oh, we're going to the clans all the way. You know, they all sound like the same guy too. You know, they sound like the guy who works in a programming office over at FLA. Don't let that station come over. No. I wouldn't wish that station on Hitler. They have enough of them over here, but it's not religious to say. Same old tired craft man. Same old pontificating voices, solving all the problems that were old telling everybody what to think and what to do to screw them. Right. Neil, it's a pleasure talking to you. Well, it's great to hear your voice and you hang in there, sir. Now that you're in touch with almost reality, you keep your finger off. Almost. Okay. Thank you, sir. Bye. By the way, how come nobody called in today to give us a critique of Batman? You think that millions of people, not that all that money is pouring in because people are bored to death? That millions of people were to see that by now. I wouldn't see it if they paid me a hundred dollars a minute. I would not go see that. The first one was just dark and depressing and dank and had nothing whatsoever to do with it. It had about as much connection with Batman as the exorcist did. I mean, none whatsoever. Not to mention, of course, that Michael Keaton is just he's like one step away from Richard gear. Okay. I wouldn't be surprised if they're like rodents in his tights. 144 in WIOD Hollywood. Yeah, Neil, how are you doing? Pretty good. Yeah, I love, I got to call you and tell you that I enjoy it. You're an inspiration to me. You know, you're one that doesn't put up with any. That rick is out of control. Oh, yeah. I got to say, you're one that doesn't put up with any crap. Right. I got to, I got to admire your instinct because I tell you, you're, you're, I've been listening to you for years and you've been, you've really touched me with, with entertainment. I mean, that's, and that's what we need. There's so much, well, that's our idea. We want to touch everybody while we get to change. I'll tell you, because there's just so much of doom and gloom out there. I mean, with a new Constitutional law that permits the hate crimes. Right. And, and I, and I, and I got to tell you, if anybody that doesn't, you know, that doesn't appreciate life, they should really get a life. Exactly. You know, well, I'm taught from Hollywood. Okay. And I tell you, um, all I got to say is you're one of my favorite, um, dysdia. He's in, in one of your favorite. What? Yeah. Radio radio. Oh, Todd, you were doing so great until you said that. Well, you were doing, you, I mean, you were doing such a magnificent, uh, pump job until you said that and all of a sudden. I know, I, I got, I got my tongue caught my mouth there. Right. Well, get it unfolded. Okay. Have a great day, Todd. God bless you there, Neil. See ya. That was Todd. 145. And, and, anyways, the good guys just emotional now is just a basketball case. He was, uh, once it was a really important place to come. You can't remember where it was. Here's a lady in Boka. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, man. Yes. I wanted to thank you. I mean, first of all, you're welcome. Okay. Thanks. But the best thing about this is you made me get up. I'm Florida Atlas and look up your mama and ozoneio. No, no, not your mama. It's. Why mama? Yeah. I remember that Elvis Presley saw. Why mama why are you sleeping with me? Yeah. But I learned a little bit more about this day. Right. Yeah. Yeah. We're sticking pins in it all over the place today, man. Painful. Is it painful? It is. Well, you've lightened up. It's like drizzling down here and brought up here in Boka from where you are. This is fun, though, isn't it? It's excellent. It's like we're reaching out and kind of like touching all over the whole state. Like we got this gigantic hand. And we're sticking our magical fingers into everybody's ear all over the state. You made me think about getting my own map and every time I hear about it, and I say, putting our new area, putting a little pin in my own. Great. Yeah. Well, stick a pin in it. I sure will. Pack, we should get some new bumper stickers for the whole state. Stick a pin in for somebody. Okay. Listen, thanks very much. I have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye. 147. I W I O D. Stick a pin in it. See if it hurts. Hey, listen, when you look at the state of Florida on the map, you know it's got to be painful. 147 on news talk radio 610 W I O D. That's 326 O 260.
