Why does that tell you we love your show up here in Lando Lake? Lando Lake, fine, it's north of Leeds. You know, I have never heard so many, you know, I've lived in Florida for 19 years now. And I thought I knew this state pretty well. I've been around, you know, I've been around the backyard once or twice. And I'm here in a place that I have never heard of before. We got a call yesterday from Bomb. Yeah, heard of that. And we're like, we have like, we're right down there by Wumama. So why Mama, we are monster in why Mama? Yeah, did you go to the shelf space and then get your map yet? No, I still didn't do that. I forgot about it. And these cheap pastures here, they won't give us a map. They won't do anything here, man, because our program directors are geek. And he's just not into this thing. It requires a little bit too much effort. You don't like anything that smells like work. Yeah, well, we try to do socials here ourselves from the people from the woods. I don't blame you. But believe it or not, there's some people in Lando Lake that have a loose address. So I think you're probably like, oh, what in that year? Yeah. They're going, oh no, they think we're from woods. Yeah. But we really live in Lando Lake, and it's even in a different county. Well, it's been a real tweet. And we'll talk to you again, okay? Okay, good night. Have a great week. Bye bye. Lando Lake's George, put it on the map. Let's just think about your pins in a wall. We don't have any map on here. We'll just think about your pins in it. So anyway, these seat-teat times this morning. This is great. This is the kind of stuff that I really love because you got to get a shovel out, man. And just pile it and pile it and pile it as high as you can. It's under the what's news column by Roger Fisher in the same p times. And it says, there's a new talk station in town and up in the WFLA. Couldn't be happier if operations manager Gabe Hobbs. That's OP is to be believed. Double UFO lace. Oops. I just want to know where to send the check. He said after briefly sampling the first days worth of chatter on news talk. On news talk, 620WSU went on Monday. So far they spent a lot of their shows talking about us. WSUN, which in fact is poking fun at itself or cost effective programming. Made its debut as an all-talk station with live somelcast from corporate sibling Miami's WIOD. The ever controversial new rogers tend to do the wacky Rick and suds to the six. From the major Porsche the WSUN's live talk programming, not of which is based in Tampa Bay. On opening date both shows host spent a lot of time trying to talk WFLA in its various personalities. One has to wonder if WSUN's home-based Miami audience was at least a little confused by some of the chatter directed at the Tampa Bay approach. Yet serious they loved it. This approach certainly is cost effective whether it becomes simply effective remains to be seen. Any, now here's the great line in here. Any life on the AM dial should be welcomed by listeners and even by its competitors. How do you like that? To show you that AM over there is almost as exciting as it has been over here. Terminal deadly, comatose, on nightmare. But I always love these guys like Opie over there. Oh yeah, where do we send the check? They're giving us a lot of publicity. Who the hell are you kidding? You paranoid slime ball? Like he's got everybody locked up tighter than a drum. They can't respond to us. They can't talk about it. We don't operate that way here because we're not paranoid Opie. We talk about everybody. We talk about whatever the way we want to talk about. And when the numbers come out each and every month when the trends come out, we read them all. Whether we do well, whether we do crappy or in between. We go down a whole because we want our listeners to know what's really going on. And we don't lie, we don't make them up. But we don't say, hey, we beat the crap out of everybody when we didn't. Because we're not paranoid. And because we're like kicking ass like yours, Opie. Let's do a lady in Sarasota. Hello. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Wonderful. I'm so happy. I know you don't want depressed stories today. And I want to tell you, you're the most wonderful thing that's happened to Sarasota.

And I was planning a trip. And now I'm not going to go because listening to your. Even the guy in Luts is like a large. The guy in Luts and like he's like an integral part of the show now. Yeah.

We talk about it in the in the lines with the groceries. Yeah. Well, listen, say how to some of my old friends over there, man. Because I was there on 19 years ago, 1973 at the St. Armon Circle, WSPB. Well, they're all gone now. Like they're all gone now. But again, thrilling. I was spinning through the AM dial. I love talk radio and I'm all and I've even listened to Rush just to listen to talk radio. Oh, God. No wonder you're so happy. I'm too excited. It's wonderful. It's great. And I don't care about all those people who don't like you. Just like I said, they're codependent. They need to talk to you because they're going to try to fix you. Yeah. And I have a great weekend.

No, I'm not upset about it, but just saying... ...a fortune in the... ...we don't need to hear that on the radio. We're not talking about abortion. You're the one that just said that. I said, ass. And right away, you're on abortion. I heard earlier you said that. This guy's been listening to that. Heinrich Himmler. Look at what I heard, think. I heard you say something about abortion on the radio earlier. That was her. That, I said that this show was an abortion. So why do you compare that to something like that? Like what? Like ass?

Or anywhere around there, and I'll meet up with him. Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why does he have to come out to plant city? Because I got a bunch of my friends in plant city. Why are you? Wait a minute. Why is it always you and your friends were back on this again. Can't you meet this guy head on? He sounds like a little nice, whipped big guy, a little faggy guy. Why can't you handle him one on one? Why is it always... Why is it... You Mr. Brave with a UNURA 85,000 friends, okay? Hey, I can handle him one on one. Tell him to come out to Crystal tonight. All right. Do you tell him that, too? To be out of Crystal, we'll be out. You're going to buy him some cheese fries? No, I'm not buying some, but I think I'll be that. Well, you're just going to fry his ass. What? I said you're just going to have a good time with him. I'll tell you something. You are the most sickest piece of garbage I ever heard in my life. And thank God you discovered us. And I'm telling you, we're going to keep up to you off. You understand it? Keep it up. We will. We can do it. We'll be off now. I will be off. All right. Sooner or later we'll all be off. Have a great weekend. Yeah, you too. Oh, did you hear that, sir? Oh, this is... That's wonderful. Great. I love it. He's the best. He's the best. And now he's got a pickup truck and a pit bulldog. Yep. And then spit him to back all over the plate up there. Right. And probably in our house would like a half a moon on it. Yeah. It would exactly. Which fits right in with the new is chronic. I think he goes over a moon's dimmer. Now he's a good guy. It really is. He just, he just, we're going to head a bad up ring in or something. He's just bitter. He's, I, I, I, I, I wait every day for him to call on. He did that. He had like a bad bowl of grits one time. Yeah. It was really young and he hasn't been able to give it out of a system yet. But what are these days, man? That baby will squirt right out and he'll feel a lot better about it. Yeah. Exactly. I think that's a brain cleansing experience. So you're like in lutes, but probably not like up the street for him at all. No, I, I hope no, I didn't. Yeah. Well, you're recognizing my guarantee of that. If you see him at U-float and we're one of those places, you'll probably recognize him. Exactly. Well, listen, have a great weekend. You can, I'll tell you why. You can be like lutes number two, okay? Okay. Listen. Yeah. I get like the FLA calling number. I would like you to call in and bust. Well, they won't, the first of all brushes on tape number one. He don't take any life. No. They lied to you about that. He's on tape. And number two, they wouldn't put any of us, Rick and Suds tried that on Monday right out of the box. They tried to call in. We friendly and just say, how you doing? And they're so paranoid over there. They won't put anybody on the ear that even mentions issue when ring of this. So it's a waste of time, okay? Well, you're sure it's great, man. Well, thanks a lot. I've made the switch. Have a good one and watch yourself. Okay. Bye-bye. Man, we are just, a lutes is like a hotbed of activity for us. You're listening to a tape-related broadcast from our sister station in Miami. The Neil Rogers show on News Talk Radio 620, WSUN. Some people don't have a clue. We don't have a clue. We walk around. We've been at our levels. We've always been. There's just looking for things. And there's no view. Like the chronic influence. Overcoming from now. We're just a little bit closer. We're just a little bit closer. We're just a little bit closer. We're waiting for you, dude. I just come out of where do you green for me? We, you and what army of Lilia who suit me. All your friends are here over here. Why do you bring them? Why don't you stand up like your own. It's always we. Like you got all your buddies. How come you don't like stand up your own thing? We do stand on our way. Where is that we again, man? Are you speaking French or English? Well, now sure you can't even spell us. We don't want to ask these things on the radio. Right. And you know, you know, you know what we're doing? Wait, what? What was that? You said like that baby now. Are you and Lise are you an increase? You're right. I think you've been up in England with that baby. You want to know about it. Wait till the morning. Some people don't. They don't have a clue. They don't go around. They don't have a clue. It's always the same. They just look in for fame. And you love the old. They like the comic of the old. You know what I forgot to mention today? Double UFO Lise. Salt. We're like just spreading like a big gigantic tortoise. We like crawled out of the mong. And we're like creeping along and poking out every now and then. And they're just sticking that big one eye out to see who's here and what's what? Speaking of what's what? Let's go to Hollywood. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. You know what? It goes to show you that if you give people a chance to like branch out and do new things. That it's just amazing what can happen. Even though we do have a mental case for a program director. Yep. That's him. You got that. Are you sure this isn't him? No, no. You got big Bob sitting up there and playing a city on a pondwood bench in front of the country Wood store there. Yeah. What is pick him up truck and his pit building in Plopke and his rebel flag and he's property is going down to the dry cleaners and get his freshly white press suit as you're going to wear it with his hood tonight. Yeah. And he's actually going to tell you right now. We ain't going to stand for it, Neil. You better get off the end. We don't like this. Yeah. We don't like it but turn it up a little bit. Yeah, I tell you. Have another beer, Bob. Have a cold. We love you, Diane. So Florida. I think he's really calling from P.R. Ryan. I think he is. He's a long time nearly and I don't think he's fallen anybody. Right. And I just don't know who he's trying to fool. But that's how he'd bring him probably bring us a blunt shot Monday. Well, I can't wait to hear him Monday. You know, he's got to be on the business. Oh, man. Can you imagine after all the big meetings over the weekend he'll probably be just full of it and never probably get Loots Jr there on there with him too. I think he'll probably trim it up that big furry beard. He's got on his face. I think Loots wanted Loots too. I think something may happen with those two very soon. Trying to fit into them. I mean, I thought the comproman I was talking about a Bog turbine. They have an academic self. They all did on that fine wood mansion front of the country. Well, sort of sit on the cold beer. So you know, you know, overhauls. Man, you know those guys that wear those bib overhauls like for long stretches like many, many days at a time. Oh, man, it must be really ripe in there. Be about. I just want to say one thing above. Above, believe the girls alone now go get your stuff. Handful sheep for the weekend. And then just talk about New Yorkers. We love you down here. And don't tell them more bad things about us. That's it. We just love your butt. Come on down. Now we listen to Neil for many, many years. It's time we turn John to him. So come on down, Baba. Okay. Have a go. Pick a winner, pal. I'll tell you one place where we are kicking. I mean, besides the lutes. I mean, we know we got lutes wrapped up. But in sorry soda, can you believe it? We're just like between New College and the clown college. Any what? Other guys? Hello? Yeah, there's just mentioned clown college. Yes. Good question for you. Is this the same tweet? Yeah, the same tweet. Okay. Good question. Where do you go? You guys throw out of anyway. The Asslime. Out of the way? Out of the slime. I believe it. I've got to listen to that station for the last two years. Also, you asked, oh, show up. Right. And you're talking about all the old people. I don't think so. You don't think so. What? Don't think, Pete. Oh, no. There's no old people in the same pit. I just made it up. He just made it up. Right. Just like you made it up. That where assholes. Now, I make up you aren't assholes. You don't know that. So you don't know us well enough to become as asshole. Oh, yes. I do. I've been lost one clown. I've got news for you. He was clowns like all of us are clowns. And why is that, sir? Because without playing your favorite spit kick in music. On a station that was like losing their ass that couldn't find an audience at a pantyweight. I'm saying you're pantyweight. The pantyweight. Yeah, I'm a pantyweight. That's in lutes. Pantyweight. Pantyweight. We have to like spell it out for you. You've been listening too much of that music. Sir, it's been affecting your mind. Now, are you still listening? Oh, yeah, clown, I've listened. You're still listening. Now, how is that possible? Are you like in the S and M like on the M side? Like a serious massacist? Like you can't stand it. We're proud that we suck. And I'm an asshole. But you're listening. How is that possible? How is that possible? Why? Where is he? Where do you have one of those little pieces of station they had? Do you have one of those crystal sets that only tunes in 620? You can't find any other station? I said you would be only listening. No, no, no, no, no. You just kind of a wise ass. Now, let me ask you again. Why are you still listening? You don't like me. You don't like the show. You don't like Rick and Sud. You don't like anything. You said I don't talk to Liz. I don't talk to Liz. I think you need it. See, I'm going to tell you a couple of little things. What? I got a couple of idiots out here that like to listen to it. You don't. I'm going to talk with it. And so in other words, they got like you held hostage in a broom closet. And they're forcing you to listen. Now, they're in my office. They're in your office? I call a police. They was good, man. Now, who are you? Sir, who's chain are you? We hear this crap here all the time. Oh, I can't stand you guys. But we got a couple of people here at the office. I'm forced to listen to it. Well, that's just to get away from the radio. Go stick your head out to window. Get some fresh air. Another professional mouth content for whom we are doing a man. To be honest, we're going to have a big party up there at Stakenflake. One of these days. And we're all going to sit around and be unhappy. And we're going to have a big party up there at Stakenflake. One of these days. And we're all going to sit around and be unhappy. Oh, man, this stuff really sucks. You know, that kind of, yeah. And we'll play our little strad of various and fiddle with it. All right. I'm looking forward to that. Let's get feedback. Let's get back to what I was going to tell the story. I'm sitting there, my own business on Saturday. My house watching some boring thing on TV. And the doorbell rings. And my dog started barking and screaming and puking and carrying out like the Usually, do just for variety. And I go to the door and it's Rick, my mailman. It was a good guy. And his own bizarre, like most mail carriers are peculiar way. And I go out and he's got like, you know, I thought he's got like a registered letter or a certified something special. No, he just wants to be at. So I go outside. And I'm talking. He says, voice is, you know, that, this new out of town hookup. This is sure the best thing that's ever happened. I said, yeah, we're having a great time. Is it? Because over there at the post office, man, they were all a search. And it was getting really desperate. They were all like a ready to tune out. They were all searching for something else. And this came along just in time. And here I just got through between the 930 to 10. Half hour, which they nearly killed me. And then the gallbladder, which came very close. I thought to killing me. And, you know, it's like, it's like, here's a guy who's been, you know, not through the most pleasant time recently. And who gives a crap. And so the collar is suck. And his town is basically boring. His dog droppings. And the guy's like, well, you know, we were ready to tune out, you know? They were searching. Well, search for this. Okay. Are you goofballs at the post office in plantation? Oh, God. Just like kicking you in the teeth. I mean, like, goes out of the way. Did not have it just like three crappy couple of bills. And a couple of pieces of trash mail like usual. Nothing special. And he goes out of the way to tell me the story about that. All those guys that the post office man, all are your good little royal friends over there. All right, they're out of way out, man. This thing came along just in time. Because your show sucked is what he'd basically try to say. Well, thanks Rick. Thanks for taking the time to ring the doorbell. And to give me out of, like, I think I was napping at the time out of a solid sleep to get me to come outside. So you can give me those three putrid bills a couple of crappy letters. And tell me that the guys at the post office in plantation are a bunch basically of asshole. Is what you were saying, okay? Good. They give no meaning to the word male carriers over there at the plantation PO. Here's Dany on the Sterline. All right, Neil, how are you doing? Great. Let me, I got two questions. Not two questions. I got two things to talk about. All the Broward Lides by the way, our dead is a Dornale man out there. It looks like porcelain cemetery on Broward 524Wild. I say, let's take all the Broward Lides and put him in the 800 trunk. Go ahead, sir. Good thing. Number one, how pathetic this state of Florida is. Number one, I come out of my house the other day and my wheel off my garbage pal or gone. Yeah. Firstly, in Hollywood, you're now out to have wheels on your garbage pal and to get a fine. That's number one. Wheels on your garbage pal. Yeah, you must have garbage pal with no wheels on it. You can't wheel on it. Just be wheelist. There's an ordinance in Hollywood that you can't have wheels on your garbage pal. Well, that's great. Number two, our electrical contract that came down from New York. Two years of paperwork to come down either transfer and take a license down here. Listen to this. I first, I look my paperwork and it only six, six of us who passed the exam. I don't know how they can lose my paperwork. I think they're very anti-New York first off. And so what does that mean? For anti-New York. What does that mean? I don't know. There's a lot of people coming up from up north down here. We don't want anymore people from New York. I don't blame them with too many of us any house. Right. If it's so great in New York, how come everybody wants to come here from New York? Well, David Dinkens is such a wonderful mayor. He ruined the city. Yeah. I got a news for you, sir. They were coming here long before David Dink was ever mayor of New York. Okay. Now, there are people coming here to pay for the sunshine and die anyhow. My philosophy. Yeah. I brought up. To me, like you have a lot of complaints this morning. Oh, yeah. I'm a complaint. Everybody is really all bad. I'll just shake this morning. My only complaint is about my, the people at the post office in plantation. Other than that, everything is great. And of course, about the fact that Allison and Randy never got their jobs done. Okay. Other than that. Listen to this one. Yeah. I went at the post. First, I had to get a license. Oh, God. Yes. I paid them. They go to activation fee. And they tell me I got an April. You're going to listen. With all the respect. Can I make this suggestion? Yeah. This could solve the problem. Okay. Let's go back to New York. See you people up there at the plantation post office can sit up there and critique about what I'll call soft. And this is not so exciting anymore. And he goes and do a smack and get your sitting up there with your finger with that with your finger where the moon note shine. Okay. With your fist on your colon. God is in pathetic up there and brow or that's the problem. We need to, today, word, all those brothers has been going on. This wasn't something that just started. This has been going on for two years up there. Those people have locked your man in broward counted. There's something wrong with the place. And sucks. Let's do a new poor wichy. Hello. Hello. Yes. New suck. Okay. Thank you so much. You don't rock? Yeah. Let me tell you something, buddy. It's refreshing to hear you. I'm really gay. I'm not on a skinny thing. You are the first black talk show host that has really got to me. You're cute. You're not a fan. Yeah. We'll listen to you this morning at the Golden. Let me ask you a question. How long you've been working up this material? How long are we going to work up this week? How about you? Like a team of writers put this together for you like J. Leno. We stopped that crap. I'm trying to drive you. No, I will not stop this crap. You're all looking at you. I will continue with this crap until I motivate the people of the plantation post office to get their finger out of their, how do you like that? Forget that plantation post office. They make me sick up there, okay? Listen. I'm going to tell you something. You know what? I used to listen to the Bible ass of there. Sit on here. Big fat ass. Talk to the real Rogers. He stole all your material. Right. Who years? He thought you were God. Yeah. This guy thought you were something else. Yeah. I am something. By the way, I talked to his old producer the other day. Oh my God. The day is lost. The day is lost. It is all over. Oh, I knew what I knew what I knew. Yeah. Oh, Bobby's back. Please, back. Hey, I talked to his producer the other day. I remember he never met anybody that's got fat on their eyelids. Not a lot of clasters. The only human being in the world has got fat eyelids. He can store food. You know that? Yeah. I think I have a big leg in the shirt pants. Right. I would like this. Matter of fact, you said he was storing nuts for the winter time. I don't know what he meant by that. That's what he said. Well, why don't all talk shows? Not all of them. But the majority of them get fat and grow beard. Because they sit on their big fat ass all day and just all in the only exercise to get it as their gums. Is that what it is? Right. You know I was just going to... You know Neil. And I don't have a beard by the way, sir. You don't. I'm clean shave. What is your weight? What is my weight? Yeah. Well, you stopped that on. I weigh 100-93 pounds as of this moment. And what's your height? My height? How tall are you? How big is it? How tall are you without heel? Five-nine without the slippers. Five-nine for the height. Some little. No, it's not just right. I should weigh about 160 pounds. No, no, no. I'm like skinny guys. Right. I don't want to look in a raxic. You can't bet with a skinny guy. If I go on a bed with the knee, she'll be blind. Really? Well, I guess the divorce of experience. Well, have a great day. Neil? Yes. You're coming in strong. Great. Say it something. Keep up the good work. You do have some bad colors. You're not too far from a Hudson, are you, by the way? Well, this is no part of which. This is a class area. But that's not far. You know what? This is a home-off. This is the most boring talk show in the world. Which one is that? Mr. Williams or Mr. Williams? Mr. Williams. Bruce Williams. Oh, Bruce Williams. Oh, man. He's a good place for him. Believe me. There's nobody living here under the age of 65. Uh-huh. Hello, Bruce. I want to go into business. I'm 110. No, I don't invest in my future. Wouldn't you like to hear him just once in one of these guys call him and say, You know, Bruce, I can't make my payments. And I've lost my job. What advice should you know? Wouldn't you like to hear him just once they burn your damn house down and run out of town? Right. Exactly. That's the kind of advice you give him. You bet. Well, that's the kind of advice you give him because you're all hard. I don't want to suck up here. You know what I'm saying? You do. You already started. But I'm going to tell you what I said. The voice of experience. You're a broth of fresh air. We'll have a great day. See you. Newport Richie ladies and gentlemen and Hudson. Write close together there. In fact, I think Aaron's coming over to that guy for a little, uh, a little lunchtime, something. That's our new sounder. Those are the boots from Loots. Is this really a Loots call? Yes. Our new Loots listener? Yes. On Renewed Lester. On Bolavable Sir. I wish that all the Yankees would go back with their peel-push and selfish. But I'm not just going back. I think they've talked funny. They come down here and they take all the jobs away from people that live here. Right. Right. And they just, uh, they stink. They're screwed up. Yeah. I wish they would all go back. They're obnoxious and they smell bad. Yeah. I'd rather have to. And they got just pounds of armpit here. And I don't know what it is about you, but I don't like you. But you suck. Right. You sound like the guy from Bob. That he sounds just like the guy from what you call. No poor Richie. Didn't he? With a different voice. He likes me because I suck. Well, I've heard that before. That was another caller from Loots. Man, we are kicking ass in Loots. We can't buy a call in Broward, but we are dynamite in Loots. I bet you there's a lot of dynamite in Loots. That way, I'm in it. Here is a plantation. Hello. How many food do you eat? What is it? How many food do you eat? Let me ask you something. How old are you? How many food do you eat? How many food do you eat? 10. Would you like to make it 11? Yeah. And don't ever make a call like this again, punk. We have an open line in date, 751-100-Broward, 5-2-4-9-4. How many food do you eat? How many food do you eat? How many food do you eat? Your 10 years old, and that's the way you speak. God help us. The human race, man. There's no help for us at all. No wonder Alice just eating. At least it tastes good. At least it satisfying his immediate urges. Because I think the guy in Wackel and Waco may have a point. This could be a last piece of it. So let's just pick out extra butter on the moths. Did I guys? Brainton. I didn't do the thing. Hello. Hi. Hi. This is your chronic every three weeks. I called the food. You're one-caller in Brainton. Great. Well, I'm not eating it. I'm not sweating. So can I still be on your show? I guess. I won't keep you whole hour though. You have to eat a lot and sweat. I'll help a lot to get a whole hour on this show. I'm not exaggerating. He was sweating so profusely. His face was so red. Especially when he started laughing. I know. I was prevented. I was convinced that he was not going to make it through that hour. I mean, he was just barely functioning. I want to wish you a baby cheeky. Oh, and likewise. That's it. Japanese, too. Are you cereal? Japanese, you? Yes, I am. Well, how much sushi do you have on Pesah? Unlikely, huh? A Japanese Jew is at my conversion by marriage, but... I know. There are Japanese Jews? No. My grandfather was Jewish. My grandmother was French and Japanese. Well, I'll be damned. That's incredible. Well, not really. Well, how many Jews are there in Japan? Six? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. Not a whole lot. Never counted. Never counted, but probably could have yet. There are a couple hours. I am American. Well, that's great. I wanted to do a... Ask you, is it all right for a straight lady to say... Neil God? Oh, yeah. How about in Japanese? Ha ha ha ha ha. Huh? Can you do that? Ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. But I don't think I would. Why not? Let's give it a shot. Come on. We'll make you a star. We'll put it on card. Well, I wanted to put some... You remember when Marilyn Monroe sang... Have a birthday present? Right. Mr. President. Right. Well, I wanted to... And actually my religion is a bit more serious to me than... Putting, you know. Well, I can say, yeah. Neil... In-tar. Ha ha ha ha. That's it. Turn it up, George. But I wanted to test. I wanted to say, Neil God. Well, that's great. May I? Go ahead. Neil. Ha ha ha. God. How about that? Well, it sounds like Al got the audience sufficiently aroused even if he wasn't. Have a great day. Hey, I want to ask you something. Happy pays off, yes? Was the hockey game yet named? Was the hockey team yet named? Ah, yeah. Go ahead. May I be good. How do you like it's for law to free? Florida free isn't bad. In fact, Al's probably one of those right now and is way to the game. Okay, if you remember who said it. Okay. You'll bring him. Have a happy year, too. Bye-bye. There's our Japanese you. We have an open line in the green line. 1-800-944-Pace-A-S. What? Spark the champion. Spark you. And champions. Choose we need. Let's see that spark in action. Keep your eye on fleet. Put it richy-ish. But the coating center field for the fillets. Here's the pitch. Oh, it's a low-sinking line around over second. Looks like it's in there. Ash is racing in. He makes a desperate time. And he's up with that ball. A stupid, too spring kick by Richie Ashburn. Man, oh man. He's really got that spark. Champion Ashburn fires up with weedies. How about you? Remember what sparks a champion sparks you? What sparks a champion? Spark you. And champions. Choose weedies. I guess that's... Oh, show up already. I guess diving for those line drives is a good way to get a richy-assburn. He has a matter of fact, you know what else I saw? The founder seats. They have special food. I was watching one of the pieces on the news over the weekend. And they were shown one of the concession guys. And he was peddling some kind of seafood stuff with shrimp and lobster. I don't know what the hell it was. And they said, well, gee, this is like your real regular hot dogs. He said, no, this is strictly for the founder's section. And that's where I'm going to be sitting. That's where all of our W-I-O-D seats are. And those great founder seats right behind the dugout like tomorrow night in the third row. So what can I say? See how you played your cards wrong if you would have come with me to the game tomorrow. You could have like a really gun nuts. You could have had like ten times as much food and ten times the excitement and cholesterol. Sunrise. Hello. Sunrise? Right. Yeah. Are you doing? Okay. I see that Marlon's made the front page. Yes sir. Hey, what do you mean? What the eye, eye security man. The one? The eye security man. Meaning what? He's selling eye security. He's a. Yeah. You know there's an old saying about saying, you screen my screen. We all screen for eye security. Yeah, there sure is. Oh. The how you been? Pretty good. Okay. We have an open line at Broward. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. It was from sunrise. What do you want? You're my god. The median age there is death. 5 2 4 9 4 6 3. That was a super sunrise. We had all worked up for the game. He's had his weedies. And probably getting ready for a moving experience any second. Tampa. Holy cow. Exactly. Hey. I see you guys. They printed a tripping yesterday. The name of the new Miami hockey team. The Florida Panthers. Oh, please. Can I can I reach a headline here from future sports edition? And that's not official is it? I don't know. I don't know. No. But I can just see the headline now. Lightning drop pants. Yeah. That's cute. Go pants go. Hey. I want to say something about bird. I was that. Clute Robbs. Amener. Either him or Demial. Because I want to be there with that game. By the way, all you flyer fans. Gary Galley is god. I just thought I'd mention that. You're a good thing. My keen and for a coach. No. They are showing the game. You're Saturday. And Bobby Clark and him. We're sitting under press box together. Really? Yeah. Well, the story is here. Said that it's going to be somebody else. But that would be great. I like my keen and man. He'd be the next best thing to don't share. Everybody be spearing and knocking each other's hair. Got that way to do it. Yeah. For not doing nothing. Right. Exactly. For guy who had a rather mediocre career. Both as a player in a coach. He is sure probably didn't do a lot of money. Really. About bird. Bird. Yes. The bird. He bird. His taste is in his ass. You know that. Any guy you like to choke and puke or chokeers. Running around. I mean, they're not no sciler and guitar man. But cheese, you know. Ha ha ha ha ha. Woo. It would have happened. That's what he can do. Lighting around a meal God you did. Whatever happened to it. Yeah. You said you were going to carto hole bunch up. And I've been waiting for myself to come up on that. Hard about you. What? You said you were going to do a whole bunch of those meal guts. The only one I've heard is wean dog. Oh. I have a whole bunch of them carted up. Oh. You don't want to hear myself. Where the hell are they? What the hell happened on my meal God cards? You must be the guy that was in here over the weekend and stole that card. No sir. Gone. Oh. I can't put my finger on it right now. But it happens to be in the machine. No. Cut. Is that it? No. The guy. No. How does the guy? No. No. No. No. No. Got. No. Ha ha ha. Oh. No. God. Definitely not. I think that last one I recorded it at the directory. No. God. No. No. God. Shut up, Kurt. No. God. No. No. No. God. No. How many of them are on here, George? A lot? No. God. That's funny. Yeah. He won't. You notice what a wimp he is? He won't call me anymore after he said bullshot on here on this station. That we have fingered him for being the abuser of our airwaves that he is. Wouldn't do it on magic one-o-two point up your nose over there. But when he comes on this station, he hears all kinds of crap. You're a guy. No. Wow. Real good. Are you sure it's on here? No. God. No. No. No. God. No. That thing for real. No. It was before that. It was after the guy that said it is a question. You told me to clean up the phone. Real good. No. That's Scotty Mac. Yeah. You're right. Come on. You up here. Does that take any of them? Yeah. I think that was the last Scotty Mac. How about how do you know what's on the card? Is that happened to tape it that day? I'm not being a year. All right. Here we go. Real. No. No. Marvin. Marvin. Marvin. Marvin. Marvin. Marvin. Marvin. Marvin. Yeah. No. By the way, speaking of Marvin, he can be seen any hour morning noon and I roll or blade like a maniac on Miami Beach. I saw on the other day this guy. He's got a job in a bar. He's out of his mind. I mean, this guy's going to get killed. He thinks he's in. What the hell was that movie in LA? A roller. Roller blade. Roller. Roller. Roller. Yeah. I don't know. Oh, that's for pay. That's the Euro version. He's a good dude. Jesus, how many of Maranis stand thing? And now we got to get that Japanese Jewish on here too. Oh, no. God. No, not the old. See the old just. He'll. Yeah. No. No. God. It's right after that. Oh, here we go. Okay. Big build up here. I make it so excited when I hear this that I wet my pants. You. God. The one. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for telling two minutes. Yep. Venture, white bureau driving. Droid taking. Yeah. Okay. Wow. Man, if very cold could kill as much productive time as that did. Yeah, let me speak to that. I'd love me 52. Well, go. It's here for another eight minutes until we kick his fat ass. So what's new on the porno scene now? I mean, my first, my first point of film for weeks ago. I don't even think. Oh, God. So the be the outgoals in line of sex films. I'm not in it. Wait a minute. Is that a guy or a girl around the right arm? Richard Bay. Is that a guy? Is that a guy or a girl? To guy? It's a goedo. It's one of those new, Jersey, Guides. You're questioning not. I don't want any new yorkers to be offended. But I've said it many times before. Why is it not only? Well, there are a lot of Jews in New York. But why is it that people from New York are so sexless? Almost. What do you happen? Almost every New Yorker that I met. They're cold in personal. They have like, as sex is like a, like a function. There is no emotion, no passion. They'd be good in that church because they know passion. So they can't commit any sins. There's this very cold thing with New Yorkers. What is that? Oh, yes. Oh, absolutely. No, for New Yorkers. Oh, sexual. The weather is cold. In fact, you look on his show. You pay any day in months and a while, when brings him. Yeah, she was pretty. Once in a while, he'll have some people. Look like that. But more often than not, see that on the, By forget about her on the stage, The woman that's on a left the young, right there. Yeah. She's typical of what you see. They're like New York Valley girls. Well, well, they all live in Jersey. If you talk about it, and it happened, girls. A lot of them are hot. I'm gonna go with you. I think you see this great. I'm not not getting to your point. No, I'm talking about people from New York. I didn't say the girls, you forget who you're talking to. I'm just talking about New Yorkers in general. Very sexless. It's like Jews were sexless, which is most. Well, okay, but choose a look for the next meal. Did I test it? Did I test it? Did I test it? It all depends on what you're into eating. I guess that's where it's at. Can you have sex if it didn't? No, but... Are you seriously gonna have a line of porn? You're not gonna be doing stuff in the marina? No, it starts with the hitchcock thing. You know the silhouette of hitchcock. Yeah. They've hit white, white, white, and a few dry lens. Yeah. It's white angle. We had... It's hard, because he's been $12,000 for a full-length movie. Five sex scenes. We had to stop the shoot for two hours because one guy could not get in the shower. For two hours. That's when you were talking about it. Yeah, it's amazing. But a sex film can't be that good. There is enough money to do a second take. Scripps on the important. And you're right to have a pretty 19-year-old girl in a hands-for-25-year-old guy, and somebody who could speak lines. Right. That's the genre. So you just accepted, right? That's not just a little bit in a shop. Okay, getting back to April, Hurray Sprail. What are we gonna do about this guy? Are you guys? Is he resting his day? He's going to go to the good, yeah. How can you be a press agent? Really? Really? I don't know. I've got to put him on the air. He don't want to talk. Yeah. But I had lunch with him. I love him because he's nice. He's absolutely so defibrably. But he doesn't need as much as you do. He's a little bit too much. Does he? He grabs my food. Does he? I don't want to lunch with him. I hate to see anybody try to grab your food. It is fighting words. No, seriously. I don't want you to die on the air here. I feel guilty. I feel like I contributed to your demise. I don't want to be responsible for that. Now, like if it happens between here in the ballpark, they could be in accumulation. It could have been like the pastramy sandwich. Or the peaking duck probably. He wasn't going to do it. Yeah. Do you take blood sugar? I mean, you must have diabetes. No, I don't. You don't. I don't have that possible. I feel like I feel fights. Seriously, what is your blood sugar? Do you have any idea? No, I don't. No, I know my blood pressure. I'm on low presser. And I have a cholesterol. I take mevacore. Oh. What is your cholesterol? Clestrel is about 240. You said you won 75, I can't believe it. Yeah, but my last time was a little higher. It was over 200. Okay. So I got to stop eating things like pizza again after today. Yeah. Yeah, next. You don't know what your blood sugar is? No, I should look it up. Once the last time you went to a doctor, a few old four weeks ago. Yeah. And up to blood tests. They didn't. They took your blood. Yeah, it was. I mean, it's not diabetic. Not that I will be soon. I'll be taking insulin. Doesn't make any difference. You'll be taking insulin. And they'll happen to start chopping your legs off. Every day you give you something injection. No, I don't take insulin. I take, um, thank God. I take a role medication. Orl. Can you relate to that? You're a food pig. No, no, I am a food pig. But I'm with a little bit of control. I mean, you have no control. No, none. None. I have never seen a person. In fact, I'm trying to think of a parallel. Like if I were a cheesy like me. Fadrich is, but he doesn't look as bad as you do. I mean, he's big. He may, I don't know how much he weighs, but it's like more proportion. But you're like the schmoo. Like I said, it's like, like, your head is like regular size. I mean, the neck is getting a little, what do you think neck? But 19 now? Yes. Yeah. 19. I'm going to tell you something before. I thought it was a 16. Okay. So you're ahead. If you took your head like right from the beard up beautiful. Perfect. Put it on the wall somewhere. Huh? To the butt from the chin down. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger. And then around the middle, which is the worst to your heart. This is where it is. It's like this enormous schmoo like thing. Like I said, it's like somebody took a tube and they put a helium. Seriously, I'm not joking about them. Like I blow up. And I'll go steam the walking blow up though. That would be a good piece for screw. Everybody should have an outskate. They're depressing me so. Oh, because I'm trying to get you out. What do you need? Do you have a mirror in the house? Yeah. Do you like Dracula? I can't. I can't. I can't. You have to look at a mirror. You have to stand stark naked before this day is over. I want you to stand stark naked and look in the mirror. It's a cool man. But you probably haven't done it in your hand while you're doing it. Because I know you want everything else in your hand because you can't find that. You're very cruel. No, I'm not. I'm trying to, uh, to appeal to something but obviously not. Yeah, it's going to work. Why don't you say this. You don't care. Be honest with us. You don't care what we can make some news here. We can make breaking news. Elgoltstein says for the first time he's going to eat himself to death, but with a smile. Why don't you just say that? Is it true? I want to tell you what is our no medic. No, I won't do it for spike because I want to outlive all my ex-wives. I really do. Yeah. That's a truth. I'm going to be sin with it one year. I'm going to be here and you're going to say, how how do you do it? Lead me. Master. I'll be in Waco with with my brethren. I'll trust me. You're going to see it all. You'll be in Waco? Yes. You're going to lock yourself in a wait for pace off. What is that all about? Here's this for a business of maniac over there. They're locked up. They said, well, when Passover comes, then something big is going to happen over there. What is that all about? But you have to keep one that you have to know Jews. The other way, you'd have pizza delivery trucks and Chinese delivery trucks. No food in 38 days. That's what you think. Jeff Cohen from Pizza Loft is probably out of here right now. One of our people. Anywhere there's a cat in the body, you'll still deliver. Look at this. You started to choke on it down. Don't you have a tax? Do you have like coughing a tax fit? I cough a lot. Yeah. But that's all in like many seizures because you had one of those before. Because I said something during the break. That where the sweat is. It's the mama chest. I have the one. Yeah. Exactly. I want to start right answer. I get full at the stadium. I want them to have enough food. I'll be there then. Possibly. Any other concession people is you might want to call for takeout just in case because I know they're prepared for a huge crowd for opening day. They didn't count on you showing up. So what would you have there today on it? Are you like a three hundred. Are you a dopenance? No. No. No. And you got to take them out of the shell. The expensive amount of calories taken out of the shell. It's like exercise. Any of the foods like you probably don't eat like crabs because it requires two slow and requires a lot of energy. You get a shell but good. Okay. And the three hot dogs, three hot dogs. What else do they have? How about the big pretzels with mustard? Very high like in the. Yep. Tlusht. Yeah. No. What else? Do they have any candy? No cotton candy. That's because it'll show that it'll be great. How about the missed a youth fair? We just finished with the day count of youth fair. You could have gone out there and got some. You're all up cotton candy. I've had it in years. Great. You know what I had last week? That was great for the first time in years. Bit of honey. Wow. Yeah. You've been to the last time you had a bit honey. No, no. Oh, you wouldn't like that. That's not your kind of candy bar because you have to peel each section. Also, Robert, take your teeth. So, you're talking about that. But you have to peel each one off the section. Yes. Your kind of candy bar, which I've also had a couple recently, was the big king sized Snickers. Oh, great. Would you just peel it and just pop the whole thing out of it? Yeah. Poor device. He was great too. What kind? Hagen-Bas again. I had a stroke of peanut butter. Did you stroke the pie? Yeah. Did you see Fatsau with Dondela Wies rate? Wasn't it? I love it. Because this is like what this is all over again. You could be Oscar Lopetus. Remember the guy? Yeah. From Trubby Checkers? Yeah. Well, you know, this is a sad experience. No, no, because it's just a period of addiction. It's a period of adjustment. Well, I want to be said again. I was thin once I was thin again. He's from Gargantua, the just fat. I don't see. You know what would happen to you? The problem. If you would have been the way you were before. Before you went on the off the fest, you were fat. But not dangerously fat. You were you. Yeah. Okay. Now you try to be something else. And the frustration level is so great. And not being able to be that slim whatever. That you're over you're going the other way. That this is what we do. This is the real thing in the fat. Is the frustration level causes you because you can't in a few days wake up and look like Peter and Arthur or whoever it is. Then you just go crazy. And now you're going to keep doing this accordion thing. Can we? In fact, you're right about therapy. You learned that we are very we find it hard to be moderate. I bet you will. Parts of your life you are excessive because I am. Yeah. Fafi is the compulsive of other than gambling. Other than gambling. Well, thank you. I can't pitch you moderate. Very moderate. So that's it. There are lots of you races. Almost every night. I want to go. You're obsessive. No, I'm not. No. You'll watch it. Only sex in the food. For me, you'll be just the food. Yeah. I'll have a great time. It's a game. Thank you. I'm very happy to see. I wish I could say it was an uplifting experience. But I want to see your friend here. A very proud press agent. He's looking to me this whole hour. See this guy's a bastard. I'm trying to somehow shame you and do it. This is beyond the point of funny. No, no. I mean, you could be funny being laughed at. Like, God, look at how it's. But that's not you. No, I'm going to grab hold and read it. You're going to grab hold. Wow. How are you going to do that? I'm going to take a search party for you to grab hold. But look at this. He's an age press agent, really. He is so thin. I don't think he enjoys foods as much as I do. He's busy. He's busy having sex with other things in his mouth. Okay. Have a great time. How are you? Say hi to top slider and tell me is a line pony hypocrite. Have a great time as a game. Go Marlins. Don't eat too much. Okay.
