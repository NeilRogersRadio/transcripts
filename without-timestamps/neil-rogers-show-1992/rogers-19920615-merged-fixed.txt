I sweep up big dust balls in a couple of magas. I'm always grossed out by the things under there. The more that I clean, the more stuff it gets weeded up. My grandma's old inches, some green pizza curls. A lot of the hamsters that I lost with back in the 60s. He's decomposing and he's turning to dust. And now the one cleaned down there. It's time to get a maid. Got you by some rubber gloves. So my hands don't smell that way. And I don't want to clean down there. You come to books my way. Come and I may begin loud. I hear the old kisses. Here's the loud sound. We like to think yourself drunk the full of air. There's no words from town. There's the loud sound. We like to think yourself drunk the full of air. There's no words from town. Here's his word. Not his pedophile. 1007 at WIOD Happy Monday, man. Hallelujah. Oh, God. That's all I can say. No, God. Right. Amen. Let's all just sit around and pray a while. How to hell that I make it. How am I here? And like the whole room is spinning. I'm going to be in the room. Where do I start? Where do I start? Who the hell needs calls? Who the hell needs anything? All we do have a mobile and a four-laterdale? Welcome back. Could you like to be our first call on our my the day of my first day on my black and blue wedding? Welcome back. Yeah. I got a black and blue spot the size of Montana. Like our right side. Right? Am I all right? Yeah, you took it easy at home. Am I all right compared to what? Compared to like Elvis? Yeah, I feel better than he does. That's great. I just wanted to welcome you back. We all make sure the 10,000. Thank you so much. And we're glad to have you back. And have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye. Wasn't that nice, huh? Speaking nice. Thanks to the people who took it to Fensteem. Send me a nice plant. Randy Maltosh and all those guys. People have called a race course. Send me a beautiful plant. The people at Pompano Park sent me a huge fruit basket from exotic gardens. And the people at the exotic gardens got so excited about that. The drivers and the other people over there sent me a plant. A really nice one too, which I appreciate. So thanks to exotic gardens. And who might leave it out? See, I shouldn't have started doing this. I shouldn't have started doing this. Um, oh, this is embarrassing because they were like a whole bunch of crap. I mean, nice stuff. Oh, oh, geez. This is bad because I'm going to leave out about three or four people at the took the time to send me plants and stuff. I mentioned colder, right? Who did I leave out? I should have made a little list. Should I? Crap. Well, I didn't look up and down the log here. Maybe it'll recindle some memories. Then I'll point out the ones who didn't say anything. Haha. Oh, yeah. Thanks a lot to those people who didn't do a damn thing. Like, of course, I could mention the management of this radio station. I don't want to mention them. That's my opinion. I'm like Disney. Yeah. Not a card, not a call, not a letter, not a... Flower, not a pansy, not a... anything. Nothing. Are you alive? Are is there anything we can do? Nothing. Zero. Zippity. Do-da. Nothing. I know that most of you feel that I'm making it up that nobody in the audience can believe. Such heartless and myless, because I went through hell. I mean, this has been a rough ten days. Everybody thought, hey, it's a piece of cake. We heard that fat rich, yeah. Yeah. The only piece of cake that he was involved with is the one that they removed that they thought was his gobladder, which was a gigantic piece of that double chocolate cheesecake that he ate in a way home in a car couple years ago. And by the way, rich, I have real exciting news for. I was thinking about it over the weekend. The black and blue, of course, takes several days when you're fat, to raise to the surface, to the skin, so that you actually see it. So my doctor was explained to me over the weekend that it did. There's about three inches of fat on me that has to... So it was like a delayed reaction several days after the surgery. All of a sudden, you start getting this gigantic black and blue, where you lost all this blood. So reaching about six months, man, you're going to be like, one huge, a black and blue whale. They can put you in a aquarium, baby. You're going to look great. I know I left somebody out. Damn, I mentioned ticket defense team. And there were some other sponsors who sent plants because I had like about a half of dozen at least plants and the nice thing from Pompano Park and Colter. And I keep mentioning the same ones over and over again. Because I can't remember who the other ones were. Damn it. God is that embarrassing. Huh? But I should do remember who the ones who were conspicuous by their absence, where you know what I'm saying? Like, 610 WIOD Cox Enterprises with their 5.2 billion dollars. I mean, I talked to George and Cheryl a couple of times, but that was like personal, basically. I mean, that wasn't... that wasn't business. Nothing. Not as dirt. Like anything we can do. And thank God that Rick Riley let me on the earlast. What day was that? Was it Monday? When I was screaming, I'm never going to get out of here alive. See, that was people think that that they must think that that was like a joke. Okay. It wasn't a joke. It was not a joke. I believed at that point that I would never see the outside again. It was like somebody in Auschwitz getting a phone line. Please, let me speak to anybody. Okay, put me on the air. Oh yes. Even their show. Anything. Oh, how did I get out of there? Had it practically fight my way out. Let me just give a word of advice because I have lots to say today. Okay. Let me give a word of advice to everybody.

Man, they could, they took it up blood out of me. They could have a blood bank over there. They should be a plaque on the wall at Mount Sinai. The Neorodjer's blood bank. I'm sure they could have filled a bathtub with blood. And in the meantime they're saying, Oh, your blood counts, you're low. I can't understand why. No, I can't either. Okay. Take here. Have another gallon. Here you go. Oh, God. They had dig broad needles in the size of Vermont. You can have filled up. I thought they were like serving to made a juice.

So I opened up my Sun Sentinel the first day I get home last Tuesday after I had fought my way out and screamed and demanded freedom from outside our hospital. And the first thing I see in Tuesday morning Sun Sentels in article about the excessive mortality rate in many of our nation's hospitals, including Jackson here in town by the way. And that people are dying like flies and hospitals kind of a shock to me. Yeah. And then yesterday morning I opened up the Sun Sentinel and what does the headline say on page 3A? Oh, I did that wrong. What does the headline say on page 3A? Surgeons botched new technique it says. Really shock the crap out of me. Complications arise from procedure. By the way, before I get into this, I do want to say this. Dr. Harold Unger and his son Stephen the younger. The other ones who did my surgery, they're the best. They're the best in the country at this. He's done over 400 of these. Thank God. Lot of practice. So he's the best. Now if he's the best in he did this and I came out looking like this, what's going to happen if I would have had the worst? You're great, Harold. I love you. Okay. You're just tremendous. But the thing is when you go in, they tell you nothing. They tell you nothing. And let me just tell you this. I don't want anybody to get scared. I want anybody to get scared. Crappless is what I want you to get. Before you go into a hospital, let them play with your body. That's what I want you to get psychotic. I want you to ask questions that haven't been invented yet. Because they tell you absolutely nothing. Oh yeah, piece of cake for a little thing. Now I've got a whip that baby out sure. Piece of cake. Uh-huh. Full of crap. Just from the anesthesia alone, you can croak. Seriously, there's some people who just have violent reactions. Anasthesia, general anesthesia is like a major, major. Even if you have no surgery at all. I don't want to go into a big thing. A doctor show here today, but I will. I will. Because I have never felt so strongly about anything in my life. Which I have left here at this point by life. But there were many times in the last week I thought not. They were going to bring it instead of the best of meal. The rest of meal is what they were going to bring in. Like in little box. I mean the things that go on and then they start coming in and scaring the daylights out of you. And ah geez, you might get pneumonia. Of course, I was in a rumor. It was like 500 below zero. It was blowing a geol like a wind tunnel from the ceiling. They bring the technicians, no speaker in glaze. They bring them on a ladder three o'clock in the morning. They're up there, patchking around on the ceiling. He pulls a big towel out of this thing. Somebody had shoved a towel up in his damn vet on the ceiling. Like a huge beach towel. Because the wind was blowing out there 100 miles an hour. But hey, you can't take deep breaths because it hurts every time you breathe after the surgery. So you better get up and move around. Because otherwise you're going to get pneumonia. But the fact that we got at 100 below zero in here and we can't stop the wind. A little don't bother us. Don't be a nitpicker. Okay. Don't be a trouble maker now. Oh, if I started now, it would be midnight. Not today. Midnight like Thursday by the time I finished with a story of everything in this experience. You cannot believe it. You can't imagine. And you're wildest nightmares all of the things that go on. And then you tell the nerd how can anybody sleep on those beds? And the nurse says, oh, nobody sleeps in here. You can't sleep on that bed. On the only time you ever fall asleep in a hospital is when you are so physically worn out. And so exhausted and you've lost so much blood and nutrients because the food nobody can touch. My dog would laugh at it. When you're just so tall, you just collapse. And then you wake up in this bizarre position. And you know what I think? How to help? Can I ever fall asleep like this? Only because you're so exhausted. The hospital is not a place to heal. It's not a place to get better. It's not a place where it's a place to die. It's a place to catch everything that's ever been invented. And some germs and diseases that nobody can even identify it. That's what a hospital is. So anyway, the story says, surgeons, bots, new technique. Kind of caught my eye. Complication's arise from procedure to remove gallbladder. And it says, New York, New York Times, surgeons who rushed to use a new technique to remove gallbladder without adequate training have botched many procedures. New York State Health officials and surgical experts say. Since August of 1990, at least seven patients have died. And a hundred eighty five others have suffered serious or life threatening complications from the procedure. And gallbladder surgery at ninety nine of New York states two hundred four. This is just in New York. Complications are being reported to the Department of the rate of three or four each week. Some patients have blood to that. And others have needed several additional operations to repair and reconstruct organs and tissues damaged in the surgery. Our frequent injury is to the common bi-old duct, the vital tube through which bile flows to the owl to aid digestion. And other patients, the bowel and urinary bladder were injured. To reduce the hazards, the health department issued guidelines on Friday, specifying the surgeons must perform at least 15 laparoscopies under supervision before a hospital may issue credentials permitting them to perform the operation independently. That's settler and so on. The operation, this is the best the last paragraph, the best part. The operation is often called band aid surgery because it leaves a smaller scar than the traditional operation. And of course, by calling it band aid surgery, it kind of in your mind minimizes the idea that this is serious potentially life-threatening surgery. Right, of course, just to piece a cake, sure. Here, let's just put like four bullet holes in your abdomen. You'll feel great in a couple of days, man. No problem at all. God. Ten twenty two at WIO day. I can't really believe that I'm sitting here. I just cannot believe it. A week ago today, I would have bit anything that they would have had like just body parts scattered around the building. Out by the WIO snooze tombstone out there in the front. There just no way.

Here we can set this Monday afternoon on South Florida's news traffic and weather station. News talk ready-o-610-WI-O-D. Don't touch that dial. I got a number of this afternoon at two. It's Rick Briley in the Subskoman. Join us then for Rick and Sus. When I just remember one of the people I left out, Peter had absolutely traveled. They said a beautiful plant. Thank you so much, profusely. And I'm sure there were a couple of others that I left out. Okay. There's only one thing I want to say before I take this next call and that is- I'll tell you what that call you made Monday. You sounded scared, crap. Scared isn't the- that's the understatement of the century. I was hoping- remember when Lee Harvey Oswell, you remember the thing where he was saying, I'm requesting somebody to come forward and give me legal assistance like he was like alone and desperate and anybody just somebody anywhere come forward and help my ass out of this because I'm a taxi. Right. Right. And that's how I felt. Now, now how I felt how I was. Yeah. You can't- Well, you're of course calling to say that I told you so. You're right. I should have- In retrospect, if I would have drank the olive oil and the lemon juice, the worst it could have happened would have been a couple of bad VMs. Okay. I mean, that would have been the worst. Well, anyway. I mean, at least people will learn least will be somebody out there that will do it the right way. Because of all that. Or at least check it out. Yeah. Check it out. They don't give you a chance to ask anything. Okay. They have the pre-op the day before. Yeah. And you go in and they make a little scratch on your arm. Okay. You're not listening. I'm listening. They make a little scratch on your arm to check the bleeding time how fast you heal. Yeah. And it's supposed to be between three and nine minutes, three being the fastest and nine being the slowest acceptable if you're going to undergo surgery. Nine minutes is- you know how mine was? Nine minutes. Because I'm diabetic. I'm a very slow healer. People would die of be these heal very slow. So, huh? Did they question her? Well, they say, hey, it's close to the, yeah, 20 minutes. It's close enough to us. It's close enough to nine. 11. Whatever was nine minutes. Yeah. What kicked me in the butt is, do you remember the call from the surgeon who agreed that it would work in 85% of the case? The olive oil, right? You know, also. And as it turns out, because I didn't hear it, but my mother who spent two days at my house, which I didn't want to talk about. But my mother was told me that somebody called on a Rick and Spud, somebody who was part of the operating thing at the hospital. And they said, some kid. He said that the kneels go, but it was like a white hot. And that it had a bunch of small, like a couple hundred wheel, small stones that were about the size of tomato seeds. Well, tomato seeds are very small. Yeah. So it seemed to see my concern with the olive oil is that it was afraid of having to take one. Big ones in that I get what lodged in there and go, you know, and of course if it gets lodged, your gallbladder blows up like a balloon. Yeah. Like deadly. Well, they replayed the call that we talked about the 4 inch tank in the 2 inch 12. Right. Well, it would all came out the end anyway. Yeah. But I'm glad you're all right. I'm telling you, this is just I can't describe it. I just can't believe that I survived this thing. I mean, everything from the if you could have seen, I wish we could have a live studio audience. Alex Benaud would have been proud of when these two guys from the pulmonary unit come in. These two clowns. And they made a speech. My nurse almost passed out on the floor. She got so frightened from the speech about how they'd take it in X-ray. Okay. Yeah. And they found like two little tiny marks on my lungs. Well, my doctor, Dr. Unger, who like I said, if I would listen to him the whole time, I'd have been a great shape because he's the only one who know what they're like. He was talking about, but you can't just have one doctor. You got like 85 different doctors. Okay. And they come in and they make a speech about what, you know, the surgery, you get blood and the thing, he gets loose in your legs and then a blood clots and they can come into your lungs. And they made this alarming thing about pulmonary embolisms and how dangerous they are. And of course, that's not going to affect your blood pressure, right? Now listen to me. Go. They then, then they start talking about angiograms. I said, listen, even a moron like me knows what that is. There ain't no way I'm going to go into angiogram. So they, well, the first thing we do is called a lung scan. Okay. So they take me down. I want you to listen to this very carefully. Okay. Yeah. Anybody in this audience, if anyone ever says they're going to do a lung scan on your body, call the police call the FBI, call everybody you know and run some serious. And run out of their screaming and yelling, they're trying to kill me. Okay. They take me downstairs. They lie my fat body on the floor. I'm trying to picture this. Were you in a blue smock? Yeah. Yeah. Blue smock. I mean, one of those hospital gowns. That's the first thing they do is make sure you're running around almost naked so that you feel totally different. They do. They've drawn up the crack here. Right. Exactly. So they take me down and lie me on his slab and they take, I'm telling you, I know I saw Mangle was one of the name of the doctors in this room. I'm serious. And they take a hood like an SNM thing and they strap it around your head. So I'm serious. So tight that it feels like your head is going to explode. Okay. I'm making this up. You're laughing. I'm serious. They then take the mouthpiece, which is like a breathing thing from from oxygen. Right. And they put that over your mouth. Right. And then they say, don't worry about it. Are you clots or clots? Well, I found out I was. They said, don't worry about it. This is pure oxygen. Just take deep breaths. Okay. Thank you so much, Sunny. Just sense a nice stuff. Thank you, sir. So anyway, then they tell you breathe. Well, after the first 30 seconds, you don't feel like you are breathing. Even though they tell you, they give you a story while it's pure oxygen. You don't feel like you're breathing. You feel like you're smothering. I mean smothering and this thing on your head is so tight. And I just reached up and grabbed it off my head. I couldn't stand it. I thought I was going to lose my mind. Oh no. I'm not yet. Not yet. Just keep breathing. Okay. What's something want you to see? And so we know it's not that you can't see. You can see. But this thing is strapped from like your forehead around to the back of your head. You can see. It's just that you can't breathe that's all. And that your head is exploding. So now he puts it back. Then he puts it back on there again. And for about another 40 seconds to a minute. I guess I finally lasted long enough to get it done. And then I reached up. I just pulled it off again. I said, no, I just then they take the thing and they put it over your head to take pictures of your lungs with some other thing. And they lower it to the point where it's just about touching your body like an MRI or something like that. And now you're lying there and you've just gone through this other real constrictive claustrophobic experience and you've just finished. And now that takes forever and they inject course you got the little IV thing conveniently on your wrist. So anybody comes up. Oh, here. Let me stick some stuff in there. Okay, you don't have any idea what they're sticking in the IV. Oh, here. Let me put the needle in there and your liner to take. So the best part of the whole deal is then after this, they take me in for ultrasound of my legs to check for blood clots. Which ultrasound is fine. It's like they do on a gallbladder. That's that's that is a piece of cake. That's painless. And the two women are in there and they're looking in and fine. No problem at all. There's squeeze in my legs. You see the blood is there's no blood clots in there. So I'm lying there. And now these two SNM pulmonary guys come in. Oh, man. The pictures are perfect. Dr. Ranger was right. It was nothing. We just was a false alarm. And of course, see they can always say, well, you know, this pulmonary embolism can be fatal. So we're just covering the really covering their ass. But we're just making sure you want to say. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Listen, when they get to win, they're every test that's ever been invented. Every test that they ever thought of. Every machine that the hospital can afford to buy. You're helping to pay for. Okay. Because they're going to do everything on you that they can think of doing. Well, you know, something that kind of boots me up. Because after that, I started turning everybody down. I go back up and I'm back. I'm back. I'll, oh, Mar, you can wheel me around and there anyway. Oh, Mar, you can wheel me all over the hospital. God, they have so many nice people in Mount Sinai. And so many nice looking people in her too. And of course, my luck. I'm in there. You know, if I would have if, if I were even bother talking about it. You know what I'm saying? They would have lined up at the door. There's nothing I could do at that point. I'm like, help us. Oh, there's really a point. Oh, there's really a point. No. Well, thank God. Catheter. Yeah. Give me. Because usually after in the season, you have a hard time, you know, moving. No, I just had a little bottle. Oh, you were lucky. Yeah. Okay. Then what? How do you feel? How do I feel right now? Yeah. Just a little week. You ought to see the giant black and blue. I'm sure not everybody in the building who's got a strong enough stomach look. I've got black and blue. I'd say a third of my whole right side is dark purple. Do you like black and blue? Let me ask you a question. This is what I don't understand. Normally when you get gallbladder taxes because the stones are large. No, not necessarily. So smaller ones get lads. They fit right over the opening. I understand. Oh, okay. I was only here. You're going to be all right, Larry. I guess as far as I know unless there are any more surprises coming. Unless the doctor, the, the, the, the pill. Oh, and then I didn't even tell you the best part. I haven't even got to the best part of the story. I'm going to tell you what's here. I finally forced my way out begging and pleading among a phone at 4 in the morning. I mean, you go in at hospitality. The minutes are like hours and the hours are like centuries. And you're so uncomfortable and the temperature and there's like this gas. They switched me to another room because the wind tunnel and the first room they couldn't stop. They put me in another room. Seriously. And it was like either too hot or too cold, but no matter what the temperature was, there was like poison gas coming from the ceiling. Okay. I felt like I was at Auschwitz. I'm telling you. I kept saying I'm like in a concentration camp. I'm nauseous all the time just smelling the air. So I finally forced my way out. I get home and the first doctor, Runger was going to let me out. And then my pill doctor, my Israeli guy from across me. Now you're not getting out of here. To Lila, I saw him coming. I thought, oh, I'm never getting out of here. So he gives me two prescriptions because I have my blood count is low. He gives me iron. You know how much iron you have to take. You'd have to eat like a metal sink. You're getting enough iron. You get, you know, it takes time to get your blood count back up. When you lose a lot of blood. And secondly, because he's so terrified that I have infection, he gives me a prescription for a horse pill penicillin. It's called augmentant 500 milligrams, 3 a.m. Do you know how much 500 milligrams of anything is? The pills are like elephant droppings. That's how big they are. Well, that night, guess what? I'm allergic. I find out which I never knew before. I start itching. You ever have poison ivy for my hands? My back. I'm breaking out in the hives. I went through seven, eight hours of the worst living a hell in the history of the human race, augmentant. How do you like that? So in other words, no matter what was going on, and none of it at anything had to do with my gallbladder. Do you follow what I'm saying? I was going through all these other pulmonary embolisms. You're bleeding to death inside. You've got like screaming hives. It was a pleasant week. But you took the time to call Rick and said. Yeah. Have a good. Well, wait a minute. How much have you lost? What do you mean by that? I mean, I'm not sure all this trauma you had to lose some more hair. No, no, I'm exactly the same. You're kidding. No, I'm not kidding. Well, they pump your sofa. A crap. It takes like seven years just to get the chemicals out of your body. Anyway, did you get the keep any to stone? Good day. 1037 and Wiod. Hey, now I can go with Arnold's all the time, okay? I'm serious. Once you get your gallbladder out, man, you can enjoy the great stuff from Arnold's Royal Castle. Like round the clock, nonstop. Those great Neely Burgers and those fantastic Rochester White Hots in those great brought Worst from Don and Bob's. You just can't beat it as the tradition lives on at Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle. I've been doing it since 1980. As a matter of fact, Wayne has been there for over 25 years. Just working up a sweat right over the well, not right over the grill, but at least a good distance. And the castle burgers are made with blue ribbon ground beef, grilled sweet onions, pickle, chipier, choice of toppings, birch beer and a frosted mug just like they did years ago. And the famous Rochester at our White Hots and Red Hots with Wayne's own home a Tatin meat sauce that he jumped up and down on with his big fat feet. Gueranty de Best coffee ever made with the same recipe of blends used by the old original Royal Castle. And the Neely Burger made with hotel-cut layered bacon and top with hot melted American cheese. You'll love everything on a menu including course to great breakfast that you can have 24 hours a day. And come in this month and help celebrate the anniversary at Wayne Arnold's with the delicious free frosted mug of birch beer with all food orders. You can't beat that with a stick. They're open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Never closed even on Chivouis. Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle just a block west of I-95 and 120 fifth street, 12490 Northwest 7th Avenue in North Miami. Never a hassle at Wayne Arnold's Royal Castle. I don't have a news update from the award winning 610 W-A-O-D news and it comes up at the top of the hour. You're the greatest thing to hear. Come with you, I-O-D. You from Heddley House. It's here at last. The hip-risk scripture that speaks to today's team. He's the team Bible God bless God bless from the Holy Spirit Bible stories. The creation. And God said excellent and well, it was excellent. The fall of Adam and Eve. South Wayne. Even voices in the printing book. I have a turn command and I'm for you. No way. W-A-O-D. The team Bible also includes the top 10 songs of all time. Yay. Don't I walk through the shadow of the valley of death? Wow. Like serious bummer. And you'll get the totally bodacious new testament. Let us to do who's without sin. Cast the first stone. No. So fasten your Bible bells. And get your team on the road to Total Salvation. We're not worthy. We're not worthy. The team Bible, the good book that cops a two. acknowledged partying. 1042 a W-I-O-D. Here's a lady mobile and P-Rine. I told you. You're right. I told you. Yeah. And definitely don't take drugs. I don't believe you've got to give you drugs. What do you mean by that? Cast the one after when you took drugs. Yeah. What do you say now? I know. I know my friend. I would've told you don't tell. The lady drug pusher she knows better than anybody. What she's doing to the public. Don't take those things. First of all, when you're in there. We're doing that hospital. When you get the anesthesia, you've got only knows what they're pumping into your body. Okay? Careful. And it takes days and days for all that stuff to work. It's way out. And you have like gas inside every part. Every bone, every rib. I mean, just all over. Every time you move, it's like an internal fart. I mean, it's just unbelievable. And then you have that little IV on the wrist. So like I said before, they keep coming along and just jabbing stuff in there. You don't know what they're putting in there. That's part of the nurse. And so finally, I just started saying, no, what get back up after this horrible lung scan, which I thought was going to be the last moments of my life. Okay? Can you ever imagine? Can you even envision a procedure like this? I'm back up in a room within five minutes. There's two nurses in there. Oh, guess what? We're both here to get blood. One wants blood from the artery and the other from the vein. I said, guess what? You're both leaving. Okay? And I'm serious. And after that, I started kicking everybody out. I became the biggest pain in the ass. They probably ever had in that hospital. And that's my advice to everybody. If you're in there alone, just make a nuisance of yourself. Just make yourself the biggest pain in the ass and scream and carry on until they finally just can't handle it anymore. Can you leave it for in the morning, really? No, I was going to. And I've been doctor, rung around the phone, convinced me to stay until seven. And I somehow miraculously fell asleep. I have no idea how. And I wake up at seven. He comes in about seven, 15. He checks me over. You're okay, but papa. And he signs me out. I'm discharged. Okay? I'm waiting for them to come and take this little live. I'm going to live eating out of my wrist. So I can get there a lot of there and drive myself home. Now, about 20 minutes goes by and here, doctor, firm in the Israeli poll doctor from across the street. My other doctor, when he appears at the door, and I said, oh, my life in a worth of crap now. Okay, I'm never getting out of here. And oh, no, he shows me the thing on the little page. Dr. Runger wrote, patient discharge, depot approval of doctor, firm in. So in other words, when he approved, got away. And then he does takes the time to mark me the two prescriptions. I want to wish for the penicillin that nearly turned my life into a living here. Yeah, lucky to die. If you ever take a look at the act, have you ever taken a drug you're allergic to? Never. If you can imagine, I'm serious. If you can imagine, your hands are so. Are itching so bad and so red that you want to rub the skin off of them. It's like having poison IV only multiplied time 100. And now hives are breaking out in huge. Blotches all over every part of your body on your ass on your side on your back. And it's just it's and then even in fact, it's five in a morning. I, I had fall asleep for about 20 minutes. I wake up and I feel a nodule on the side of my, the bridge of my nose, the size of a peanut on the bridge of my nose. And you're paying 100 bucks for that prescription. Two and a half bucks a tablet. Okay. Two and a half bucks a pill augmentant. Exactly. And I've taken other kinds of penicillin before. So there's no general rule of thumb if you're allergic to penicillin. Never take it. Oh, man. Never take it. You can die. I mean, you can have respiratory failure. Yeah. And you know, another thing that goes on since you're a pill pusher, you know, something that should be illegal. You notice when you get your prescription. You, almost never ever get the package insert that tells you to conquer. No, we don't want you to read that. No, we're never taking it. And all the side effects and all the sudden, like, you know, that little minor things like that. You never get that. You just get the nice little plastic bottle from the pharmacist. They do it on me. Right. Exactly. They should be a law in the state of Florida that there must be a package insert with every prescription or they can't sell it to you. That should be the law in this goddamn state. No way. That's not carried away. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So you know, care. You have no conscience. You're slaughtering people. I told you not to go in the hospital. But that well, I was in there. I, I, I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that I really, most of the time, felt I would never get out of their alive. You're laughing, but I'm telling you, I really thought you're there because the stuff that was going on was so on godly. I can't, I can't even describe it to you. I used to be a nurse of our house. How can you, how can you recover first of all when you're in a room where the air is like poison. Okay. It is so, it is so unsafe to breathe to to every breath. It's like you're breathing not just few. You can't even dial them six people on the plate, breathing on the plate. Right. We're like breathing air, air and air. We disease that's ever been invented. And then secondly, the food, such a lack of anything edible there. My dogs would turn their nose, the amount that I ate. Now, fat rich, finally smuggled me on a cheeseburger. Seriously. And that was from the cafeteria. And it was just a mediocre cheeseburger. But it tasted like the greatest thing I'd ever eaten in my life. It was just a miracle. A miracle. God. Yeah. That's what I said. I can't get over it. I just can't believe it. The people are so foolish. And then I was at the track over the weekend at Popano and woman comes up to me to tell me stories about her poor husband that nearly bled it at the in the hospital and went in for something relatively minor in a butchered him up and a stuff that went on just incredible. It's unbelievable. You were right. You were right. You were right. I know. I know. I had to call me a bitch. You tell him. Just sit on it. Sit on this. Have a great day. Bye. Bye. 1047 a W I O D. We have an open line in date 751 and 2 and Broward. See that hasn't changed. Well, it's Monday. Just try to keep in perspective. Okay. 524 W I O D. Two open lines and Broward. Let's not get carried away and show that we care too much. Okay. Let's not overreact here this morning. Because obviously we don't give a crap. But all these people are like our management here. Okay. Totally indifferent to human suffering or anything. Can you really believe that? I still can't get over that. I was in a hospital for four and a half days. I was like went through a major. I mean, this was like a serious nasty maybe life threatening thing. Far worse than I ever dreamed. Not a phone call, not a card, not a bunch of Twinkies, not a not a plant, not anything. Like I mean, they had certain who where I was. They know my address. I mean, they sure knew my phone number enough to have George called me and bug me about some commercial damn thing. You know, here I'm lying there at home like wondering if I'm ever going to live again. If my skin is ever going to stop itching and I'm never going to be able to have one day of comfort again in my pathetic meaningless life. Nothing from the powers that be here at Cox Broadcasting. You or we don't give a crap station. Okay. Just totally absolutely insensitive to anything. This fall, joint is for another exciting season of dolphins in Hurricanes. But all action right here on South Florida's sports station. We're going to fly your tail. Danny Jackson is God. Oh. Yeah. 1052 a Wild. Here's a little joe on the phone. Another dispenser of vakilling drugs. Glad to have you back there, Uncle. Yeah. Another guy who's making a whole life occupation of dispensing killer drugs to mankind. I never said they killed anybody. They do. Well, that's because you took the wrong one. You're destroying the human race. And this whole society's all hung up about street drugs and cocaine and pod and this one. And that one and a haste. You know, all of a sudden crap. I got news for you. There are more people dying every day in this country. And more people hooked on these obnoxious disgusting, highly destructive prescription drugs. Then all the people put together who are doing so called recreational drugs. Okay. We got a drug problem in this country. All right, and it's from people like you and the film lady. And all you doctors out there who are putting all these people on these prescription drugs have a nice life, Mike. But I am making good money off of them. What is it? Like Reneri just walked out. I want to say have a nice life before I'm being never knowing might not see him again. Yeah. Huh? Why, I told you at least I'm making money off of them. Yeah, that's good. Well, at least you're a good American capitalist. Exactly. It's like the medical profession. They make money off of people suffering. And I think that's great. Well, doctors are the worst. And if you don't suffer already, they'll make sure that you will before you're through. I'm not shooting up anything. Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm going to go home and take some of them. I'll take some here on the air tomorrow. Put on a real floor show for the audience. I'll bring some in and pass it around everybody. I just want to make sure you already. Do you know what that is? Augmented? No. It's a form of penicillin. Do you know how much 500 milligrams of anything is? What? 500 milligrams is like an elephant pill. It's like a whale pill. It's like a bowling ball. Okay. You have to shovel it down with a shoe horn. Okay. 500 milligrams. Three times a day. And by the time I got to the fifth one, my wrists were itching like I should have slid them. And by the time I finished the sixth one, my whole body was doing Saint-Viette's dance. Dance on this, doctor. Oh, but I haven't told you the best part of the story. So I get up in the morning. I mean, I say, get up after maybe 20 minutes sleep, and I'm just through agony, the whole night, and I put in a call to the pill doctor's answering service. Okay. And he calls me back a little while later. I had left the message that I had a bad reaction to one of the prescriptions he prescribed. That was a rash. Huh? That was a rash you got. Listen to me. He calls and says, Neil, what happened? You got a rash? You know what that's like? That's like asking some of the people in the Holocaust, if they had a headache. That's what did I get a rash, okay? And then he says, oh, what a shame because you know, all those blood tests came back negative. In other words, I didn't have any infection. I didn't have any bacteria. All of a sudden, I was going to call you yesterday and tell you to discontinue it. He was going to do. He never got around to it, but he was going to call me and tell me to discontinue taking it. Because again, just like the long scan and all this other invasive crap, it was unnecessary. It was just panic, panic city. They're also scared, crapless, that something's going to happen to you, that they're going to get a malpractice suit, that they wind up doing a thousand million different things to you, that you don't need to be done in the first place. And just using your body like a goddamn chemistry set. I can experiment. Yeah, right. Right. Like a bad trip. What? What? Yeah. Right. All right, uncle. Just search your conscience, Joey. Me? I have no guilt whatsoever. Just search your conscience for the damage that you're doing to the human race, that they're expense. Okay. Just remember a sucker's born every minute. Exactly. See you later. 1056 at WIOD. Yeah, isn't it a great line? I was going to call you yesterday. All the tests came back negative. I was going to call you and tell you to discontinue it. Didn't get around to it. So isn't it great that you got this great experience? Look at the good part of it. I found out that I'm allergic to some forms of pedicillin. And if you would have called me and I wouldn't have had a lot of taken enough of them for that to set in, I wouldn't have found that out. So next time could have been like this. Thanks a lot, Doc. Here's the, uh, oh, one of our good friends. Yes. The cockamoon lady. Oh, I know. Happy to. Yeah. Your voice? A live, yes. I'm glad to hear everything's alright. Oh, yeah. It's great. I called your choice. But I'm not alone. I cockamoon. I spoke to George twice to find out how you would get involved. Yeah. Can you believe that the powers that be in this place never even called to see if there was anything that I needed or that they could do or how I was nothing? Can you believe that? Yeah. So that's me when I was in the hospital. Me? I brought more like a funeral tower. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, I got a lot of flowers, but not from these people here. Yeah, right. Right. All they do is squeeze and manipulate and use you till every last drain or blood is left and I got news. I haven't got much left for him. Yeah. Well, take it. I made sure I flashed my black and blue all over the place in this building today so they could all see it. You know, because the first thing that comes to your mind is, oh, jeez, taking a whole week off now. This was supposed to be a one or two day day. You know, in a course right away, they think you're screwing off. You know what I'm saying? Right. Right. Well, don't look for it yourself. Make it so well. Right. And screw them. Everything will be alright. Okay. Take care, dear. Have a great day. Thank you. And don't forget. Cocker wound. Right. 1058. Wild. We have an open line in the center. No, look at that. They're smoking now. Here's coral springs. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah, how you doing? I'm doing great, man. I've been listening to you now. Let's get off the hospital such a tiny bit. Oh, yeah. Right. Let's say just show to suit your convenience. Sir, what is it you'd like to talk about? Well, I've been listening to you for about five months now. Mm-hmm. I'm just talking to my friend yesterday. All right. Actually, a couple days ago. Yeah. And I was telling me all about your show. You know, I was in through it for about three years now. He loves you. Yeah. And he told me something about you. I didn't think was true. I'm going to ask you. Yeah. Yeah. You're almost sexual. Oh, God. Let me ask you something. You suffer from like penis and vasir or something like that. I've got a listen. Job and sexual. You just love a listen. You're flaming. I get it. Okay. That's good. I'm just going to stop and talk about faggot. Okay. There you go. You probably work in a hospital. You spineless little whimp. God Almighty, you little pencil needle thing. We can't say dick because we're not sure that's his name, right? Where could have been? Right. That could have been his name. Anyway, we have, what do we got? Henry Burrow with the 11 o'clock Wiod. He knows Henry's like nauseous. He thought Henry's not here. What are you talking about Henry's not here? I'm Henry. God Henry, you've booked up dramatically since I left. Like I said, good old Elaine is here. Elaine who's a shmoosen around with all the politicians and brow to try to make yourself a star. And we got Rick and Spud with open phones from 2 to 6 this afternoon. Thank you. God's God. Wiod. The Neo Road to Stone. You had to see me eight. It's about time with Spud. Have we sold up those newsy divisions that are sucking our bottom line dry? Sir, as I may have mentioned before, Oklahoma Nebraska are not divisions. They're stakes. They're part of the union. Union. Don't ever use that word in this office, sorry. What a sorry. Sir. That's better. Now, what else is going on? Well, the Saudis called. They want to know if we could restore their F-16 service? Those dead beats still, those mutians. They won't be buzzing any camels until they settle up with accounts receivable. President Perrell, I'm wishes here to see you. Good. Send it in. What is it? You're blessed. Perrell, what you're doing here is on cost to do shout. Well, that's a pretty big word for a man in a cheap suit, fella. I called you idiots in here to tell you I'm streamlining the government. You go on. Yeah, so you're all fired. What a crazy crazy. I'm going to save his country, a fortune by having all our laws made in Mexico. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Lemonade was six to W.I.O.D. For a lane. She looks like she's been through six operations. Then she looks bad. Let's burn out, badly. Here's a lady in Tamarack. Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am. I am so glad to hear you've been to Mone on the radio. It's so good to have you back. Yeah. I'm not. I haven't been able to listen every day, but I listen today's the first day or back since the operation. That's right. Oh, I just wanted to tell you that. They play the same crappy tapes that they always do, you know. It's just well, it's a well-out story. I didn't list that. I didn't list that. I didn't listen. But only an abushly market like this, but they get away with doing that. But it's a lot of tapes on the air every time the host isn't there. It's a joke. It was sad too because I think I was flicking. I think I was flicking. I was flicking. It was the one about the LA stuff and I said, oh man. Yeah, that was timely. I wanted to tell you that I'm not sure the date. I think was like Monday or Tuesday, Rick, you called Rick and Sudd. Monday. Monday, okay, money. And you sounded obviously very desperate. Frantic. That's the word, frantic. But it was weird because to me, I didn't listen to the whole. I've listened to a lot of Rick and Sudd that day, what I normally don't. But the next day when it came on, I turned it on because I told my husband I said, I can't believe this. I said, it's like, Neil, this appeared. It's like the radio police said Rick and Sudd, you're not allowed to talk to him anymore. And he's in a limbo. And I never heard anything the rest of the time. Well, I don't understand what he means by that. Well, they talked to you, but then the car waiting came on. It said Dr. Runger. Oops. All right. Right. You can call waiting. But then. Yeah, you know, that's the interesting thing. He sent these two pulmonary guys and who made the speech about pulmonary embolism. The blood clots in the lung and got me just scared to death. And then the nurse almost passed out on the floor. And then the two guys said, well, we're going to go talk to the doctor about it. And see what he says. And I'm waiting. And I'm waiting. And I'm asking the nurses. Where is the doctor? And he said, well, I'm not going to go on. And that's why when he came back on there, I said, I cannot believe you left at this particular point. I can't, and he was just foaming it them out that they had come and said these things. He was ready to attack him with a syringe. Well, you know, that's what goes on in the hospital. They run around with scalpel and syringes chasing each other up and out a hallway. I'm sorry about that. Everything seems really disconnected when you're in the hospital. Nothing. You're disconnected from reality. And the thing I'm not exaggerating when I say this. I don't want to be an alarmist, but I've been in a, you know, I haven't spent a lot of time in the hospital, but I have friends who have been so I've been in a lot of hospitals. And the one thing that's a constant no matter how good they're supposed to be is that you can't read the air. It's either too hot or too cold and it's has this nauseating, sickening smell that every breath you take makes you the puke from it. Just how can you get better in that kind of environment? That's a stuff they watch the floor with. You called red soap when I was in red soap. I was a hospital volunteer and we used to wear some clothes red soap. I want to tell you something years ago I was in Baptist hospital. Okay, for two days I had mono, which by the way, they couldn't diagnose. They kept asking me about Barry Barry about all these exotic and my carapractor came and he asked me to take a mono spot test. And they said, Oh, no, we never thought of that. Well, guess what I had mono. Okay, I was running down. So I was in there for two days and the second day I started bitching because it was so hot and there I couldn't breathe. So they send the guy in there with his little ladder. There's always some guy who knows speaking in glaze. He comes with a ladder. And luckily the vent was just off to the side of the bed not directly over it. He gets up on a ladder. He pulls this vent off the ceiling and about 4,000 years of crap of gray, like dead rats. I mean, all just starts falling out and he's choking back. And to think that the people in every room are breathing this crap in. And this is what hospitals are like. Yeah, well, it's just like the government would think of your oxides from the same way or he's based on money. Yeah, right. Exactly. I was really, I don't want to bore your listeners and everybody hang up. But I wouldn't tell you that I was worried about you. And I didn't realize how much I like to listen to you bitch and moan and laugh and play your bits. I have to be sick and I have to stay home all on all day. And it's really refreshing to hear you put in your two cents worth whether I agree or not. And unfortunately most of the time I find myself agreeing. But I do want to tell you that I like you and I have a request. Would you just play that thing? It's just me or God. Either something or that. It's so funny. There's something about that Orlando when you see me knows the naked nose under were you. Good. Yeah. Okay. And I'm glad to have you back now. Thanks. Bye. Bye. 11 after 11 at WIOD. Some lady sent me another catalog. Another one of those underwork catalogs in which Orlando was prominently displayed throughout. I mean, what kind of a macho guy from Miami or lander runs around and underwear all over the place. I think, we love you, but enough is enough. That's a wrong card. Anyway, he was on this morning all over. What is that all about? I'm turned on CBS this morning. We got built Clinton on for two hours. And last week they had parole on for like, what is that all about? God, I just don't understand it. Anyway, I think I'm going to have a real exciting experience in a couple of minutes. I think we better have a real long break prepared because that soup was great from Sunni's, but had like all kinds of rough edging. You know what I'm saying? Like broccoli and carrots and the cabbage soup. Boy, that is great for cleaning out all that industrial strength group that they put in your body in a hospital. Man. I mean, just a matter of moments. You are flying down those stairs. I mean, you just can't your eyeballs are just dilating their turning brown. Anyway, our good friend, Ponytail over at PizzaLoft says we're not the fastest. We're not the cheapest, we're just the best and the biggest pain in the ass. And interesting. I didn't hear a word from him all this time either. It's not amazing. And then he heard a word from a good old chap. Everything is fresh cooked to order.

The opinions expressed in this program and I'm not necessarily those of six-10 WIOD or exposures. 1115 at WIOD. Look at that level of excitement, man, on these phones. Just go into the commercial break and three people drop off including two and Broward. That's the one thing about this town that I no matter what anybody tells me. I know that I'm right. Okay. No heart. It wouldn't make any difference if I was having an open heart surgery right on a countertop here. Ah, we're busy. Okay. How good like that? We have an open line on the Starline, star IOD and one on the center square and Broward at 524WIOD. Another typical great welcome home party, Neil. Yeah. We're excited. We're about as enthusiastic about you as your management man. We love you. Lantana. Yeah, Neil. Yeah. Thank you so much. Did you happen to have a private room when you were there? Yes. Okay. I had a routine, my leg ram, about two weeks ago. You had a one? A routine, my leg ram. My leg ram. Right. That's like a spinal tap. Ooh. And when you hear the word routine, a bell should go off. There is no such thing as a routine procedure in a hospital. Right. It's like routine surgery. There's no such thing. Right. And you said, well, we'll have to keep you 24 hours to do observation, sign up. Yeah. So as I was, I built up to build a build up. Right. As I was at the desk, they start saying, do you have a living will? And would you like to be an organ donor and all these, uh, quite yeah. Right. So thank you. It builds up a lot of comfort. Right. Right. And the doctor was great though, as he was doing the procedure. Because all I've done a thousand of these, because whatever you do, don't bend over because if you bend over the... Well, don't ever bend over in a hospital. As you bend over the diet that they inject in your body happens to go to your brain. Now, won't do anything but cause a massive headache. So as I was there, I was in my room after the procedure was done. And I was paged in the nurse. And now nurses are okay, but these aids that they have. That don't speak any English are probably about your worst. No speaking English. Right. We had quite a bit of that in Mount Sinai. There were several people, no speaking English, and don't confuse me with the fact and stuff like that. Well, cause I had to take a leak. And my jug was down by the bed, so I bent over. Yeah. And the dye went to my head. Oh. The mass of headache. So the nurse finally came in after I got this jug. And I got a very massive headache. Can you give me anything? Any hard drug to heartestate you got. And, you know, just something to get rid of this headache. Well, as she was leaving the room, she met this other aid. And they start speaking some different language. And just took a time. And now her later, there she comes back with whatever she had. By that time, I was, you know, exhausted. A hospital was not a place to get well. No. And I just want to tell you. And it's also not a place to have like a major accident in the room. Because there was one night I pressed the button about three different times. And no response. And I was lying. It was nothing, earth shaking. But it was something I needed either like a percussive that they kept Doping me up with for pain or whatever. That's what I had. Yeah. And it's not just nothing happened. And I kept thinking of myself, what would have happened if I would have fallen out of the bed and be having like some massive horrendous coronary or something right now? Because nobody was responding. Now was your purpose that 500 milligrams? I don't know. Well, anything I'm hoping to milligrams, I think, is too much. Yeah. They have to be inserted manually if they're that big. But anyway, I just wanted to tell you. I'm glad you're back. And could you send me a autograph stone? Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 11.0. 10.0. And maybe we're gonna be a moving experience any second here. Open line on the out of town line. I'm telling you that cabbage soup with all that good roughage in their boy. That just sweeps through like a gigantic electric broom. Right through your system, man. God.

Good morning. Glad to have you back. A little lot of breaths from running up and down the stairs. Wow. You're taking it easy.

Thanks for the cabin soup, Sonny. Oh, that's your did it. Wow. And you know what I discovered? What did you discover? I already do believe we have Legionnaires Disease in this building. There is a there's an aroma in a hallway and believe me it's not from my recent experience. There is something in this place that is just people are falling left and right. Wow. Like flies. Do you know channel seven investigation? Right. Get them over here right now. Wow. By the way, also the I just mentioned this in passing. The guiding light special that was on Friday night on CBS was the most the biggest disappointment the biggest crock of garbage. What's it really? Ah man, we saw like about three seconds worth of birth power and two seconds worth of pop-a-bauer and like a four seconds worth of Rita and it was terrible. It was a big disappointment to me. It's crap. Terrible. awful. I get y'all afforded them. Right. Disappointment. There was no mic power. There was like about one second of the original Edbauer. There was just nothing. It's such a great show and it's been on for so long and they got all the video and they could have put some together good but instead of that it was crap. Terrible. Yes. She just watched Coke games now. Speaking of crap. My bad luck they had GN on a cable over at Mount Siner. Oh, those are you saw those games. Oh, even the night they won the double header from the cardinals they went on till the wee hours of the morning. And it was the most terminal and the most aggravating and they couldn't hit the ball out of the infield and it was just went on and on and on and on and I was lying there like cock-eyed like propped up at that bed and I had these awful migraines behind. Have you ever had a headache behind your eyes? Yes. Those are the worst headaches in the world. Like right behind like the back they're so bad that the back of your eyeballs ache. That's how bad they are. Okay. And laying there and I'm looking and I'm like, oh we're in the 80-50 and the cops can't hit it on the infield and holy cow. This is pathetic and oh. Yeah. The next night we lost a four-run leader five. Yeah. Yeah, I think that was the first night I was home as a matter. What when I was that was that Tuesday? I think it was Tuesday. Yeah, that was the first night. I was home and we gave all of a sudden against Tukesbury who by the way is going to kill us again tonight. We got all of a sudden we're smoking and we're scoring runs and we're heading for nothing and even Danny Jackson's got a big lead and lo and behold a little bit later it's in the toilet. Yeah. And that's where I went. A mad rush. Oh we're forna run now. So listen I got these gigantic horse pills I'd like you to try. They're like 7,000 milligrams. Take one every five minutes and let's see if you can survive it. Okay. My little boy takes augmentant and they're big pills for him. He takes augmentant. He has taken a boom. Oh, God. It's supposed to be doable. The pill doctors man these people are murals. You're a murals. Remember how long have you been listening? Have I been listening to me? To you? Yeah. A long time. Back when I used to have guests. Yeah. Do you remember Henry Rothblatt? The great attorney Henry Rothbott the criminal attorney who just absolutely was psychotic about the medical profession and he used to come on. He used to scream and he was just great and the sad part about Henry is that he developed this melanoma on his wrist. He got like a cancerous tumor. Wow. And he was so crazy about doctors because he had represented many of them over the years and seen the way that they'd butchered up people all horrible things they didn't. And he just absolutely refused to trust any doctor. And so the thing went up his arm and it was brain and like in no time he was dead. Right. So if you don't allow them to do it to and if you're paranoid and you'll get any treatment that it's just as bad. That's right. It's brutal. It's just unbelievable. On that note, did you hear about Frank? The guy that played Frank? Yeah, they. She and he died. He died. Yeah. Lastly. Well, how come we just got through a couple of months ago. Do you remember when we were reading it on the ear? Yep. About how he had some kiddie of things and he was taking treatments and he was going to have to take dialysis and he was getting all that weight back and it was all a bunch of crap and he had AIDS and he died. That's it. Why? You know what really bothers me? Why is it when somebody has AIDS? They have to go to such great lengths to cover it up. Right. Why is that? And then every one of them. Why is it? So that somebody's going to think that they were gay? Well, who the hell cares? He's dead now anyway. What their hands is it made? That's right. God. That's what I say to unbelievable. He died last week. I think it was Tuesday. I wonder for Robert Reed had AIDS? I don't know. What did Robert Reed die from by the way? Maybe one of the kids. I think it was. Well, see there you go. All these generalizations. That's right. Well, listen, I have no idea what we're talking about. I'm just so happy that I was able to make it up and down the stairs that you have no idea what a tremendous experience that was. One of the best of my lifetime. Oh God, Neil. Oh, well, if you're happy, I'm happy. That's what I'm here for. I haven't read this. I'm sorry. 1130 a W I O D where it's just like one constant B M B in in this place. We have an open line on the out of town line. 1 84944 W I O D. What are we going to do about this pot? You hear that? We got a dirty pot. This is such a why am I getting excited again? I mean, I've been here for almost four years. It's not going to go in a hospital a week. I think I'm going to come back it's going to change. Of course not. It is such a slipshot, such an embarrassing, such a bush league place. What are the engineers doing? What are the management people doing? What exactly? Okay, well, put it down for a minute. Okay, let it heal up for a while and come in here and check something's out. Make the place work. Make it like a little smoother, okay? During the break, I'm sitting down there in the magic room and I hear this little voice from the next stall going, who could do that? I don't know who it was. Here's a lady in Fort Loderdale. Hello. No. Yes. My name is when? It's when? Lynn. Lynn. Yeah. How are you doing, Lynn? I've been listening to you for a while. First, I was a force listener because my husband listened to you. Right, we have a lot of people. I had to tell you how to, how to, how to, how to, how to gunpoint first to listen every day to this show. But I listened to you now because I like your opinion. You have some nice opinions and I agree with a lot of them. Right. But I've been listening to you since you got back from the hospital. Yes. And I listened to Rick and said, where you're in the hospital. Yes. Now, I'm not saying that this works for everybody, but I've recently, within the last eight months, had someone who went into the holistic medicine with the juicing and the exercise and things like that. Right. So now I've gotten into it. And there's a book that I want to send you, it's called juicing for life. It's called the juicing man. No, juicing for life. Is that by Gary Null? No, a Sherry column and Marie. Well, you sound so defensive about this. I happen to believe in that. Okay. That doesn't mean I do it, but I happen to be a big believer in that kind of thing. Okay. And will that make sense? Because I know that every day that we're on this planet, we are being poisoned and we're just absolutely being decimated. It's a miracle. We can get up in a morning. Absolutely. I don't even bother going to a hospital anymore. It's like forget it. I don't want to go there. I won't go there. I told, I when I got out of there, I told the doctor, there are only two ways you'll ever get me in any hospital again, either in a coma or in a box. That's I'm not joking. Those are the only two ways I will ever go into a hospital again. And I was, I was just listening to your earlier while I was on hold. And you were talking about body cleansing. Well, there's a juice that you can drink that just like takes that and it just like gets rid of like everything. You know, it takes everything bad. It's rid of everything. It's rid of everything. Yeah. It cleans out your system. It's a body cleanser. There's one for cleansing your blood. And it is just... Let me cleansing your blood. I don't have any of that. No, I don't. I think I have blood. I don't have any blood. I have no blood left. You know, they kept coming in for more by said, listen, check the dipstick. There you'll find zero. There's none left. There is none left. You've taken every drop I've got. And in the meantime, one of the first things they had me just going crazy about was one of the doctors had me convinced that I was suffering in massive internal bleeding because my blood count was so low. Okay? And that's always a pleasant thing. And I said to doctor, younger, I says, well, what happens if you are having internal bleeding? He said, well, then we have to go open you up again. Now, stop and think I'm lying there in this weakened condition where I'm already terrified that I'm on death's door. And I'm being told, well, maybe if you're bleeding inside, we might have to open you up again, which means, of course, Morana static and like we start all over again. And I said, well, when would you do that? He said, oh, well, we would only do that to save your life. Oh, and I'm thinking, oh, Jesus, this sounds really promising now. So I got into this do thing thing. I'm trying to go total vegetarian. I'm not saying that it works for everybody, but it works for me. And I got into it from a lady that I do house, but that I did housekeeping for it. And when she went into half her son five years ago, the anesthesiologist cut off the oxygen to her brain. So therefore, it cut off the oxygen to the brain and the letter to where she couldn't walk and she had a speech, you know, problem. Yeah. So she got tired after three years of going to medical doctors and nothing was happened. Well, send me the book, Glenn. I'll send you the book, Neil. I'll do it. And let's so we can get your way from the freaking hospital. Okay. All right. You're a great day, Neil. I'm glad you're back. Here's a lady from outside. Hi, Neil. Hi. Um, last week we came to visit you a couple of nurses and respiratory therapists. Right. You remember? Oh, a bunch of people came to visit. Especially after I came on the year with Rick Rally. There were all these people. Eddie Morgan was there. All of PR people. And everybody that came in and ruined my said the same thing. I said, I'm not going to get out of here alive. But I did. You did get out alive. Well, surprise. And you got out of lives because of a good medical nurse and care. Oh, yeah. Okay. Come on, Neil. What's the poem? I don't understand what went wrong. Do you understand what went wrong? What does that mean? It just sounds like neurotic about it. Yeah, neurotic. He was a lovely experience. It was wonderful. He refers to the best of them to those being informed. Yeah. And that's one of the scary things were being hospitalized that people just don't understand medicine. So every little thing that week obviously takes a granted is. Well, when people are coming in and making speeches that maybe you're going to have blood clots in your lungs and you might be on the verge of death every minute or that maybe you're suffering massive internal bleeding and then maybe you're going to bleed to death. Or we're going to have to open you up to save your life. It isn't really conducive to feeling that too secured. You know what I'm saying? If hey, maybe there might just be something wrong going on here. Well, okay. So you have to be calm and ask questions. Right. Right. Like what the hell is going on here? Neil, we were very concerned about you. We were let you know that now some of you are stupid. There are a lot of really wonder. I'm not not just saying this because I said it before. A lot of super people there at Mount Sinai. I'm really mean that including some of the nurses and a lot of the people and every facet. There are a lot of great people there. But that's got nothing to do with everything else I'm talking about. Oh, what do you think? I mean, you could have the greatest people in a world. But if there are people who are like, you know, scaring the crap out of you and you're just suffering such anxiety and you can't breathe the air and that you're inhaling of the films that make you feel nauseous all the time, it's not conducive to getting well. Well, I don't really understand what exactly went wrong. No. What exactly happened to you. But yeah. Just seemed that you could overly nervous. Right. Right. Right. Well, we just like you to know that we're glad that you're home feeling better and back at where. Thanks. And please come back soon. Yeah. See you. Bye. Just pray that I don't and I'm sure they all are. They're just kissing the ground that I'm out of there and hope that I never return. Hey, listen, I'm just telling it like it is. Okay. The, I'm just I have no extra grind. I have no reason to say things that didn't happen or I'm just telling it exactly what happened and it's a major.

This is supposed to be your station for news. They didn't give one word. How could they give a word? Because they weren't in contact with me. So what was the word? How could they give? They didn't care. This is like a dear friend being in the hospital in you are unaware of what's going on. They really put us through. What did they think? Where idiots to listen to repeat just in case they. They they'd say they'd put your condition on. I am self-reliased at them. And George was the only one who would explain what was going on. Right. A station for news. You know what they can do with their news. That's my opinion. I'm like Disney. I'm like Disney. Yeah. And I'm glad you're back. And I love you. And I'm glad you're healthy.

I said, if people call for my real name, then fine. It's somebody I know I want to talk to. Yes. But if people call for Neil Rogers, absolutely. And then one night, they started putting colors to. I felt like I was doing a talk show. I had three in a row. And he were putting colors through. Well, I figured that because the whole world would be calling you. He would have been great. He was a chance to send a card or something. And that beer man who was really a great friend, Craig Ruzing. Yes. Well, I forgot to mention that I want to thank Craig. You know, he drove me down to my all the way. He lives in Boca and he came down and picked me up last Friday and drove me all the way down to my doctors to doctor, ongers office because I had to have the staples removed. You know, they stapled you now. They don't sew you up anymore. That's a pretty lovely. It wasn't bad. It really wasn't bad. It's a little uncomfortable. Once they're like protruding and you're walking around like some kind of a robot. But he drove me all the way down there and back home and I want to thank him. He's a super guy. He's one of them. Yeah. To talk of a little happiness and you deserve it. You know, yesterday in the Miami, Harold, the Gulf String Park had a little price schedule for accommodation for the British cup right now. And you were at $176 for a trackside table. You want to go? I thought certainly something like that would turn us smile. Do you like the $176? Yeah, what's wrong with that? That's on Saturday the big day. Yeah. And if you have, I think, eight or ten in your party. It's a little bit better rate. But do you enjoy the flats as much as you do the charter? No. I thought not to use drone trotters in you. Yeah. Well, if we can get a group together, wouldn't it be great? 10 or 20 real degenerates to go to the British cup? Yeah, I love it. As you say, now that the worst is behind you, let's get a life. Right. Okay. Thanks. Good recovery now. Thanks a lot. Bye bye. 1158 is a matter of fact, a speaking of how much I enjoy the trotters. A fat rich picked me up and drove me up and back. Friday and Saturday night to pump an o park. How do you like that? And Friday had a very pleasant experience. One of few bucks. Saturday night, a much less pleasant experience. It lost a few bucks. Although that wasn't the part that was less pleasant. The power was that some see people come and they say, hello, and that's fine. I don't mind that at all. A Joel and rich were there, Frankenstein or whatever his name is now. The world where you are, you're deep, the nearer to shine. I was riding on a train to Austin, Texas. Oh, when the very lovely lady said next to my, she got a ticket. She asked a five called her sight. I was more than happy to. Tell me how much more I'd like to do. I'll want to kiss her, but she won't let me. I want to whisper. So even up there was it her rear. I want to hold her behind. Close doors and forth. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. When she returned, she said she was an actress. She showed me an album of pictures of her opening, which even said none. She seemed to switch, she could be. But I'm clearly seeing she was the kind of girl who stole and hearts that wrecked on. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. I want to whisper. So even up there was it her rear. Thank you. I want to hold her behind. Close doors and forth. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. Well, never forget the train right down to Austin. We're saying you're the sweet, and we shared our tales. But as my heart tried to leave her behind, regrets are all my life, because I'd like to get that girl in the end. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. I want to whisper. So even up there was it her rear. I want to hold her behind. Close doors and forth. I want to kiss her, but she won't let me. Well, it's another sleepy Monday. In dry goals, 12 away to WIO. Do we got three open lines on the board? Hey, things haven't changed. The damn bit have they two of them in Broward 524? And one on the out of town line, 1-800. What's it all about, Alfie? Pembroke Pines on, that's another good thing about my vision. You know, is like all blurred up now. Probably after, like what, six, seven months. It'll start like all readjusting. And the body parts will start falling back into place. Pembroke Pines. Yeah, I know you're not much into basketball, but did you see a classmate's game? No, but I certainly saw the aftermath and all the barbarian footballs. Did you try to happen and Pittsburgh would happen? Every time a team wins a championship, there are a bunch of assholes come out and just go crazy and tear the city apart. And burn cars on fire and ripped, what the hell is it all about? What is it all about? Well, I was talking about his pop-costus in the locker room. Yeah. The other guy's about five foot four. Yeah. Interviewing these guys. It was the start of the scoring. Champagne on his head. Was he on a step ladder? No. That's the sad part. I think it would have been great if Michael Jordan would have picked his ass up and slammed dunked him through the basketball. I think it was. I think it was. It was. It was Michael Jordan. He's sitting there with his so many interviewing, you know, he's just looking for his own interview. Because no everyone just walk and buy him. And then you see Bill Cartwright walk and buy. And he goes, oh, where's Bill Cartwright? Where's Bill Cartwright? Bill Cartwright comes walking up. Have you ever heard that man speak Neil? No. He ever heard fraudulent on the little rascals? Yeah. Bill Cartwright comes up. Well, that's been great to be. Repeat and not were up there with the colored and the lakers. And they are unbelievable. These guys are just freaks of nature. I'm sure glad it's over, I'll tell you that. Bill Baseball season. My boils. I'm the one they cause. Well, congratulations. You guys did your shot. And I can't believe Rick Suckler's got nine wins. It's enough to make me wish I was back in a hospital again. Danny Jackson's tearing up the league. Danny Jackson is God, man. Maybe things are not coming up. Yeah, we're doing it. We're on the edge. All right, Neil. You take care. Work out Bob. You're a douchebag. Good luck to you. All right, Neil. 10 after noon at WOD. He had to board his empty already. So I guess the audience has shot their respective wad, huh? They've done it. Well, what do you want me to say? I mean, look at that. Is that a pretty sad commentary or what? We're into our third big hour on return Monday here. Wow, that's Monday. Wasn't a good idea to come back on a Monday. You should know Monday's heard rough. Come back on a Wednesday or someday when it's convenient for the audience to call in and tell you whatever the hell they want to say. Yeah, right. Two open lines in Broward. Let's go. Let's go. Let show us your alive for God's sakes. Oh, God. This town is hopeless. Five, two, four. W, are these lines working? Come on. Oh, you got to be joking here. These really working or what? God. They're just absolutely heartless. And I'm actually laying here in a hospital thinking that somebody gives a crap that I'm going to get a phone call from somebody in a position of authority in his place who gives a flying crap. I must be dreaming. Must be, must have been from the anesthesia. I must have been hallucinating the whole time I was in there. Speaking of hallucinogens, I almost thought that we had a call from ponytail. You know, there's another guy. Absolutely not a word, not a card. Not a pizza. That would have been great. You know what I would have done for a slice of pizza when I was in that place? Oh, God. What that would have done to my whole system. You'll find the world's best pizza at the pizza loft. Everyone is cooked to order. Never made conveyor belt style. Everything over there at the pizza trough is made with tender care and love. And they put a whole bunch of crap in it. Italian specialties like they're award-winning lasagna and stuffed shells. They're going to cut a big zedian. They're famous eggplant parmesan and they have great fugazap pizza which is some really unique stuff. Made with those great spicy onions and special spicy sauce. You've never tasted anything like it in your life. If you have any kind of a party coming up, they'll cater for you for a little as four bucks per person. And because Jeff wants to retire at a very early age and go fishing with all the dolphins every day, they never close. I mean, every holiday no matter what it is, they're going to be open for you. Serving up their great homemade Italian goodies in the best pizza in town. Here's a number to call for deliveries. Or if you'd like to call ahead and have your order of piping hot and ready when you get there. 266-51-11. And if you're really nice to Jeff, I'll even let you die in the prestigious Neil Rogers dining room. 266-51-11. For the pizza loft upstairs at 69th and flaglier in Miami, just east of the Palmetto Expressway. The opinions expressed in this program, and I miss the sale. He throws a 6-10 WI-O-D, rich by the price. Okay, there's our disclaimer that we play every 30 seconds because the management of the station thinks to show us gross and they want to make sure that you understand they have nothing to do with it. What are you eating now? God, just eating and eating and eating and eating. What the hell is it? Since you came in here today, you haven't stopped eating. You just started out with sunny very early. And what happened to the other sandwich? You ate two sandwiches? They brought a cross here. What was that corn beef? See, why is that necessary? I mean, I appreciate it, but if you're going to bring me a sandwich, why does it have 30 pounds of meat in it? Okay, why does it have to be so big that only false teeth will go around it? You have to be able to remove your teeth from your mouth to get them around the sandwich. What does that prove? Why does anybody need so much meat? Right? Exactly. Nobody needs all that meat. So what is it now you're eating after chewing on? Check it out. All it's the company lunch day. Yeah, well, if ever there was a chicken operation, there's a word missing in there, but if ever there was one, this is the place. Pointing on the starline. Hello? Yes. Me all. Hi. Hi, I'm a first time caller. Wait. Why do you call it? And say hello. We're driving down into Miami from the Keys. We just got over the front of the mile bridge. Driving down into Miami from the Keys? Yes. You mean you're driving up into Miami? Right. Why do people always do that? Like they said, they're in Miami. They say, I'm going down in New York this weekend. I don't know. Well, how come it says, bointin' beach on here? Well, I don't know. You don't know? Nope. But I wanted to tell you, we had a great time in the Keys and except for this one part, where we got thrown out of the store. I was wearing a high. I said, I wear my neck. You have high? I have a high. It's a high. A high? A high? A high? Yes. Not a high. A high. High. Right. No, not a high. And what about it? Well, this jerk, the guy who owned the store threw us out. Why? He said, we should go across the street to the Jews across the street. He'll own that store. I wasn't at nice. Yeah. So, Tom, there already too many gollum in the world, okay? Why? Why? Because I can't hear what this guy is. Okay. See ya. What a call. Is that kind of like, leave you just scratching your thing and wondering what that was all about? George is scratching the chicken bone and they're right now. At least it looks like a chicken bone. 1217 at WIOD. We have an open line. Starline at StarIOD. Here's Maria. Yes. Maria. Oh. I just had a bout of Maria. God, I'm calling you. The airwaves were barren without you. Maria, let me tell you something. The airwaves in this town are so barren that it's embarrassing. Oh, this is, this, this market is on a, on a par with O'Cala Florida. That's the level of entertainment on radio in this market. I see Steve Ziggler walking down the hall. And I want to tell them that we have a problem in our pot. And I want the engineering people to get their act together and clean up our pot. Oh, I have it on good authority. The reason that management didn't spend you, yes, flowers and flowers. They should only rot. They should only rot. They should only die a wicked death. Are you authority told me? Yes. Well, by the way, can I hint interrupt you before you go on? Yeah. Cheryl, by the way, I noticed this is out today. I hope she's not feeling ill or something what she is here now. I have good news in bad news. Cheryl, the good news is my mother brought me a whole thing full of mundled bread to bring in for Cheryl today. The bad news is I ate it. Oh, go on. I did. I ate all of it. Good for you. The whole bag full. It was great. Oh, gosh. Well, anyway, higher authority told me the reason they didn't send you flowers. Yes. You're going to get a big fact salary increase. Oh, Maria, you really have a sense of humor. Don't you, yeah. You're a real community. Maybe I'll put a bug up, you know. Yeah. How about putting your foot up is, uh, you're going to be even better. Okay. So this is from Neil. Right. Anyway, welcome back to your. Thanks, Maria. Keep on. Okay. Bye. Bye. Boy, she does have a sense of humor, huh? Open line in date 751 WIOD. Boy, sure what she could read the screen. Plantation. Hello. Hello. What was that? I don't know. Thank you. My home. My mother's phone. I know you were. Frankie, he's on the phone on the radio right now. And Mama's on there, touching around on your call. Hey, Leo. Cheese, huh? Thanks. Listen, I got a beef in plantation. Yes. Got to come a comment to make this guy. Cross the street. We had a party about a week ago. Yeah. Accidentally left the car across the sidewalk for a night. Yeah. He called the cops the next day. Oh, geez. Yeah. So far. The cops come. The cops on me. And I got a $30 ticket. Yeah. So far. For what? For having the car over the sidewalk. Well, excuse us, sir. Okay. Excuse us for ruining your pathetic old decaying life. What a pathetic guy that is. I mean, this is plantation. Yeah. Figures. The public. Right. Yeah. So I just wanted to call him a douchebag. Okay. Don't do it again, Frankie. All right. Tell Mama to stay off the phone. Yeah. Well. All right. See you. Now we're starting to get some good calls, Dammit. Including Maria with her sense of humor about to go to give me a big raise, which is why they didn't bother send me a pansy or two or anything like that. So what you want your team for us back? This was supposed to be spontaneous, guys. We don't need to hook up wireless mics and strap the bartenders down. Hold on. Just a second. Well, bartenders are busy, man. Okay. Oh, we can hear you good, Marvin. Hey, Marvin. Okay. We got a shot of fellow, Masha, a querval gold. Okay. We need to get a shot of a collula. That was right. We're spot the collula. Yeah. Old drinko has the cellar. Oh, come on. Oh, it's rare. It's rare. It's rare. Yeah. It's rare. Oh, man. Hey, make that two-con drinkos. Here we can search this Monday afternoon on South Florida's news traffic and weather station. News talk, radio, six-stand WIOD. That's the latest news traffic and weather info each morning with Mike Rinery in the morning information team just before the Neil Rogers show. Google, Google. I don't see you. 1225, a WIOD, and we need to get our pod clean. Hear that? We got a dirty, rusty, disgusting pod. All it takes is one of those little usch pritzers. Okay. And what were your spritz at though? Let's take the whole border part right on the air here. Let's just unscrew it and rip all the guts out. Kind of like being in a hospital. There's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hi, Neil. Hi. I'm so glad you're back. But I have a little story to relate. I'm almost glad I'm back and that's saying a lot. Well, I had a similar experience. I went into the hospital on Friday for a very routine procedure of blasting a kidney stone with a laser. And it was here, huh? Oh. I didn't know they could do that before. Well, I'm telling you they put some kind of a tube up in me all the way to my kidney. And all the skin and it feels like it's made out of cactus. And I suffered the whole weekend. Sick from the anesthesia, pain from the thing. And. Well, wait a minute. I feel just like you do a bot doctor's in hospital. You had a local or general. I had general. Oh, you had general. Oh, man. And I came out the next day, but I didn't. You've been one. I've been sick the whole weekend. I'll see what happened. Did they get the stonet least? They broke it up, but I mean, I got to have this tube taken out today. And they talk like it was. Thanks. You know, yeah. And I can certainly. Piece of cake. Anybody that says piece of cake just run the other directions. Screaming and yelling. Oh, my God, if I ever get a nutty stone, I want somebody to shoot me. Yeah. Just wanted to tell you, I understand how you feel. I'm going through the same thing. And I'll get really when they take this to about. Well, you're not going to have to put you under anesthesia again. I don't know, but I don't think it's going to feel good. I'm going to 230. Are you serious? Not to the hospital. They're going to do it in the office. Oh, no. It's just been like a lost weekend for me. No, no, what you went through. Well, good luck. Well, thank you. Say save the tube for a posterity. Okay. Glad you're back. Thanks. Okay, bye. Bye. Hmm. Piece of cake. Nothing to do it, bye. No problem. Yeah, you tell them, Rich. 1227 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line in date, 751. Actually, piece of cake sounds pretty good right now. Piece of anything sounds pretty good right now. Do we have anything that I like in there? God, I gave away the sandwich because it was big enough for a horse. And I don't want to start just because my gallbladder is out right now. And I don't have to watch what I eat so much. It's not going to excuse for me to start ballooning up to a jacket. What is in that? That's the sandwich? Well, I might take half of that. It's just too much meat. You know, I mean, if it's good meat, that's great. But too much meat is not good. Believe me, take it from somebody who knows. Just the right amount of meat is where it's at. Not all that meat. Here's the four-laternal. Hello. Hi. Welcome back, sir. Yes, sir. What a week. What a week. Who put together the best in the home? George puts together. What does he do? Just randomly pick out a day or something. He said you're number one and number two and number three. How do you like that? Am I wrong? Are you wrong about what? Am I wrong? Wait a minute. You think that while I was going to the most, do you think that I ever turned the station on even once? Not a chance. Not for a moment. I never gave it a thought. See, you know what bothers me about this place? I realize it's a business. I realize they pay me a lot of money. But you know something. It may come as a shock to some of these graverobbers here. There are more important things in everybody's life than WIOD or any other radio or television. Do you understand what I'm saying? I mean, like if you feel like your whole life is flashing before your eyes, the last thing you're all concerned about is what kind of manure they're going to slab on here for four hours to fill in at a time. Because I know them. They'll throw anything in there. They'll throw tapes of grandma Moses farting on there for four hours. If that'll fill the time, they don't. They can get away with it. They don't care. Not one time during the week. Was there any during that time? Was there any update or anything? Well, that's very frustrating. Well, that's very nice, isn't it? It was actually frustrating. Isn't that interesting that I had to call in from the hospital and beg to get a- Oh, and you wanted to hear the best part. I call in Marvin. Here's another thing that goes on in this station. I call. I had talked to Rick off the year at about a quarter to two. Okay, because I was really frantic. I really felt like somebody needed to know I wanted to get out of there. So I call in about ten minutes after two. And as usual, I don't know what the bad line number is. I forgot in a long ago. I call in on a regular call in line. Date line, right? And the same old crap with Mark W.I.O.D. please hold. And he puts me on a hole. I don't even get a chance. I'm like, oh, I'm Marvin, it's me. But no chance. I'm on a hole. And I'm sitting listening to the pre-delay or whatever. I mean, I just can't believe what goes on in this radio station. If you had like a life-and-death emergency and you didn't know the bat line, and you called up and you wanted to talk to somebody off the year. Please hold. And you're listening to a monovon or whatever it is. I mean, what kind of crap is that? Well, I was thinking earlier when you said you hadn't heard from Disney or any of those other guys. No. I think of my position. I think of most other people who are employed by someone. If I were to have gone through the same thing that you did, you know Dan Weld that I hear from my employer. You know what really cracks me up. You remember when they were squeezing the 9.30 and 10.5 hour out of me? And the rationale was because I was so important to WIOD that it was just a central for me to do that extra half hour. Yeah, I was so important. I was important enough to get the extra half hour out so I could go to the ratings up and bolster up that pathetic hour in there. But I'm not important enough that even like a phone call, like sign. You know how far it is from here to Mount Sinai? Do you know how far it is? I mean WIOD is in North Bay Village on the Kennedy Causeway out here. Mount Sinai Hospital is that you could throw a rock from here to where it is on Miami Beach. Okay. Well, Pox on them. They should be quite honestly. They should be embarrassed to pass you in the hall for the next. Exactly. No, any. Let them pass this. Have a great day. Have a great day. Hey. It's good to hear you back. Thanks. Take care. See ya. They may not be good. But what are you going to do? Just sit that in the window there for the next hour and a half. Maybe I'd like to have soup. I have the sandwich. I don't want to eat. I don't want more soup. It was very good. But I listen. One trip downstairs. I'm going to weaken condition. I can't keep running up and down the stairs. Like the good old days with the green apple. Oh, and let me tell you the best story. Okay. See you think that you've heard all the stories. I got millions of stories. And each one of them is true. I want you to listen to this very carefully. George, you were a witness. The day before I go in for my surgery was a Thursday. Right. A week ago, Thursday. Do you remember Jim can't find the remedy came in here and brought me a little special gift that day? Remember those chocolates? Do you remember that? That little box from the nut place up there? And he says to me, he says, Don't worry. This has no sugar in it. It's not regular chocolate. And also, it doesn't have any sorbetal. Okay. Now keep in mind, this is the day before I'm going to go in for my surgery in which case you want to be in your struggles. You certainly don't want to be in a weakened condition. You don't want to have the green apple quick step all afternoon evening on the day before you go in for your surgery, feeling like you have no energy in your body. Well, guess what? It may not have been sorbetal, but it was some tall to make the short and the tall in the long of it because from about an hour after I got home that afternoon until until I came Remember, I had an experience though which you can't even begin to imagine. Okay, from those candies. They opened my body up like somebody had stuck gigantic like a pitchfork in my colon. So thanks a lot, Jim can't find the remedy for making me like, I was in a panic. I thought, oh, it's huge. I sure hope at least this ends before I have to go in for the surgery which I had to do the first thing next morning. Oh man. Thanks a lot remedy man. You guys back there continue to be the best. They are just they're indescribable. They're just continuing to play with my life and my body. Just leave me alone, do not bring me any more food, do not bring me any more anything. Just stay away from my face and stay away from my life and go out there and write a bunch of bogus contracts and leave us alone. Is what I say. That's a good post-drami sandwich from sunny is this morning and the soup was great only too much. So I took like all the excess meat off of there and I got about a pound and a half extra. Why do places do that? Can you explain to me why? Like some of the deli type places that I want to mention their names and they have the big sandwiches and they like, There's like four times more meat than there needs to be like, oh, look while we're giving you for your money. Okay, that's why the sandwiches like 995. I know want to pay $10 for a sandwich. Okay. How about give me a sandwich for like $3.95 and give me like a third or a half of all that meat? I don't need all that meat. Nobody in the world needs all that meat. You're poisoning us. You're tearing our kishki's out with those gigantic obnoxious self-indulgent concoctions. Why? Why are you doing that to us? And as far as norm canis concern, let me say it again. Doctors and lawyers are the absolute scourge of American society. There's a strong, our world of planet in which we live. It's a disgrace. And how come instead of wasting his time playing radio on a make-believe radio station, talking to Alta Cocker's every day and pretending to be something that he's not. Why isn't this man out there fighting the evils of the medical profession? Like the late Henry Rothbatt. God, do we need another Henry Rothbatt to come back on here and scream, Dr. Welser, conjured Dr. He was the best. He was the greatest. We need another Henry Rothbatt. Not these wimps out there who are busy running around trying to be overgrown, a baseball player. We need people who give a damn about protecting the public at about correcting the injustices of mankind. That's what we need, norm. Here's a lady in Kendall. Hi. How are you doing, Neil? I'm doing fine. Hi. I'm glad to hear your back. And I just want the call and say, I have a theory of the why your managers didn't call. It's checkup on you. What is that? I'm going to say a very jealous of you and they're happy when they see you down. Right, absolutely. You are. You're going to see you down. Right. I haven't wanted to call somebody. A douche bag was going around here. A sand in my character. Okay. His name is Carlton and I want to call him the doucheous nephew of the bag. That's my opinion. I'm my Disney. Okay. I'll write a book. I have a great day. 1240, what a WIOD. We have an open line in date. 751. I'll tell you the only thing they care about in this radio station is whether you come to the Christmas party and suck around. I'm serious. That's the only thing they care about. All right. They don't give a damn. If you're dying, if you're lying, if you're alive, if you're dead, all they care about is if you're like play along and suck around and suck up to a bunch of people that hate you like poison. And if you are them, you hate them like, eh, come around and pretend. Okay. Put on this big plastic front for us. That's all they care about. Come to the Christmas party and suck around a lot. Then they like you. Oh, what a great guy. Man. Let's take his mother to lunch again. So I hope Cheryl got the message about all that delicious mandal bread that my mother brought yesterday. A whole bag full. And my mother and my aunt left after a nice lunch and a nice gathering. That was a little bit too long. But, and from the time they left the time I went to bed just slowly but surely, I ate it all. Can't eat only two or three pieces of mandal bread. You have to eat the whole bag full. It was delicious, Cheryl. Hollywood. Try me all you're doing. Great. Hey, how's mom doing anyway? She's a crazy is ever. Have I heard on the best of, uh, I guess last time the air condition was out or something like that? I think I even heard grandma Moses fart in a couple times on that show. Yeah, the fact that we're going to be taking excerpts of that for the next day. Yeah, really. Those are your chronic dead bee pelth from California. Yeah. What's going on? Did you get my card? About one. Oh, yeah, by the way, thanks to everybody who sent cards. There were like, Jillian's a cards and notes and stuff and that was very nice. Oh, I mean, more than I got from this place. Yeah, that's really, uh, Pauling man. I'm going to keep mentioning it for about a week till I get it out of my system. I mean, I grant you it's not a big deal, but it's just, it's just common sense. It's just common courtesy. If the janitor had a hang day, all it was in a hospital for two days, they would send them a card. Not as much as a phone call. Nothing. I know. And especially you would think after last Monday when I made that frantic call, when I was, I'm not joking. I really was desperate. I was praying somebody would just come over there and kind of run in her parents to save me from what they were trying to do to me over there. Well, maybe the baby doesn't think about it now. Yeah. Hey, I want to press. I'll let you know when to exhale. Hey, how big and how many were there, man? I didn't. I have no idea. Oh, they didn't tell me. Rick and suds have better idea because they haven't got a call from somebody who was, uh, some kid who was in on a procedure over there. You know, somebody in OR. Well, they have like a a squirt by squirt. The squirt by squirt description. Yeah. I mean, that would have been something good to, uh, you know, have a bedding line on it. Right. I think they in fact that they were doing that the day before I went, when as I was driving home that afternoon, getting the servitile out of my system. I heard they were doing that at the overrun ongers. Felix, longer? No, doctor. I'll handle longer. Anyway, all right. Hey, we're glad you're back. Me, all my dog needs to walk. So I got to go. Okay.

And it's been gone. Danny Jackson has won two games in a row. And how is it to the Pirates lost 13 out of 16 games in her 700 games ahead now? Can you explain that to me? Yeah and Jim Le's say is crying because of what's in the room. Jim Le's say whoever the hell is the name of the game. Love it. Yeah. What I'm a Yankee. I don't care about it. But Bobby Bont Hood is back. He's trained the muscle in his right side. Bobby Bont's are very fun. Very Bobby Same difference. You know what I'm talking about. Boy, you know your baseball. You ought to be doing our sports talks show. You know what? And another thing about the medication you were given. Don't blame it on the people in the pharmacy department. Because my better half worked here. Because I want my better half work at Mount Sinai. I didn't get it from Mount Sinai. I got it from the pharmacy where I get my, what does that got to do with anything? Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I apologize. But Danny Jackson's won two in a row since you've been sick as that. Give you a hint over there. And they all worry. Okay. I would like to say I hope you feel better. Thanks. Why? 1252 at WIOD here at the Heinrich Himmler School of Better Health and Healing. We have an open line in date 751 field this. And here's what I can't read this at all. I mean, I can. But I have to like, in other words, the whole vision pattern is changed. Which is good because I have these great progressive lenses. I just have to like put my head up like a bird. Oh, hey, there you are. See you like if I'm going to see you. You have to stand on the ceiling. West Palm Beach. Hey, Neil. How are you doing? Great. Hey, Neil. The Matt's rule of the National League. Yeah, that's obvious. They didn't take care of the pirates the way we were. They did it, boy. They are really smoking. Fall part of the master plan. Give him a false sense of security. Right. Exactly. And then when they least expected win a game. You think Jeff Torborks going to be the manager after the all start. I think Howard Johnson couldn't hit you with a bat from two feet away. That's what I thought. Next year they're going to sign pocket and bonds and help you. Okay. See you later. Good luck. I hope you feel better. Thanks. I noticed by the way, George Steinbrenner. I mentioned this for my good close personal friend, Alan J. Finkelson. Thanks. Poppin' O'Parks. It's beautiful. gigantic fruit basket. It would lots of, I mean, like with good stuff in it. You know, sometimes people send you stuff like that. And it's like all this artsy, far it's the. It's stuck you throw away. It's direct. But this was great. And I really appreciated that. But what I started to mention is that Alan's great personal friend, George Steinbrenner, thought he was going to muscle his way back in and get permission to start paging around with the Yankees again next year. And low and behold, at the very last moment comes to fight out. That all these people are ready to step forward and testify that he was like already involved. When he wasn't supposed to be and like not so fast, if they if they've been sent isn't the worst commissioner of baseball in history of the game. I'd sure like to know who was. I'll tell you that. He is at a disgrace. He is at a disgrace. Never trust a man named Faye. I'll tell you that right now. A little piece of personal advice. Do not trust anybody named Faye. Boca. Yes, sir. I want to know the day that article from New York Times about the podcast, Dr. Bobster. Who was in yesterday's Sun Sentinel page 3A? Thanks. My sister was in the Aftlufra Goldblader. Yeah. And the same thing happened. It punctured along. Oh, I'm at respirator. Some children were along. Punisher? Yep. Right through it. Oh. And so what happened? We almost left. Are you cereal? Yeah. The piece of cake. And now is in Baltimore now. Yeah. Now tiny. Incredible. So glorious. Okay. Good luck to you. See you. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. That was the best call we've had in years on this show. That was great. I like his style. We have an open seat. In spite of all adversity, you just have to look at the good things in life. That's what they see in the hospital. When you're lying there in a pool of your own blood. We have an open line on the out of timeline. And that's just a bunch of the only minutes away. That's always a good thing. I mean, the stuff that they bring you. I wouldn't see. I haven't even scratched the surface. I didn't mention about the morning that the blood test results showed my blood sugar was 300, which is very high. And they were bringing me like apples juice and ice cream. And of course, I'm diabetic. So that made all the sense in the world. Let's see if we can't get it up to maybe 500. And then put them into a diabetic coma just to make it perfect. That would be a good idea. And of course, my panic doctor. I don't want to mention which one that was. But Dr. Panic across the street. Hi, you're about the body. He's giving me insulin. I said, I don't want insulin. Don't you understand? I don't take insulin. Now, just one time, okay? I mean, he goes into such a panic. And that's see, that's what I like is that good calm reassuring bedside manner. Hey, you're going to die. That's what I like. Seriously, that's just exactly what you need when you're lying there. Help us in the hospital. And like your whole life is flashing before you are your eyes. You need somebody who is absolutely overreacts and gets you crazy. I mean, even in high anxiety, Mel Brooks never saw anything like, well, I'm standing. I'm not, you're laughing. I'm not exaggerating. Hi, you're bleeding inside. Hi, you're lungs, blood clots. I. Right. Hey, I feel better already. Just having you around, Doc. Just hold my hand. And, uh, oh, God. On second thought, hold this. We have an open line in date, 751 Wiod. And what on the other timeline? 1-800. Elurgic reaction. That's, I think that's what I'm having the whole audience. It's allergic reaction. There's a pig reporting hall in Papadol. It's not for the morning. It's not for the afternoon. Yes, sir. Whatever it is. That's the, how if I just do the villagers tell that you're here. He'll end up attacking a lot. I call it a station memory. Yeah, I'm sure they had a lot of information. I find it. Well, actually, I don't know why I spoke with, but it just rang quick. Somebody finally picked it up. And, uh, I just want to find out if they had the knowledge of what was going on and only said, uh, yeah, we talked to him all the time. Yeah, right. Right. There you go. 95 between Sample Road and No. 414. There. About 13 count. 13 of them. Wow. They have it a picnic out there. Those people are lucky day folks. 13 of them. Great. Gotta keep the set up. Yes, sir. They'll keep healing up and we'll talk to you, sir. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. 1257 at W.Y.O.D. Starlines open Star I.O.D. Uh, oh, man, I feel so much better now. Look, now look at this. I'm going to have to throw out all of that. Pastrami. There's like about a quarter of a pound there and pastrami is not cheap, but, you know, you guys to make these sandwiches. It's not that we don't appreciate it, but it just isn't necessary to overdo the amount of meat. Too much meat is a killer. Believe me. I think these guys over there must be from the John home school of sandwich making or something. I mean, enough is enough. Let's use a little bit of moderation, okay? Hollywood. Yeah. Great. I just want to see welcome back. And I cannot believe that public health is only kicking serious ass. I don't, I mean, not be wrong. You know, the best thing that happened to the cubs was when Sammy Sosa got hit on the hand with that pitch and fractured a bone in his hand. And yesterday, you notice how Doug DeSenzow ripped that great double in the gap and set up that big inning. And, you know, we finally got Sammy out of the line up. That's the secret trick is we got his ass out of there. I can't believe the only three out of, you know, 500 can't believe it. Yeah. Hey, you big kid off the serious butt. Yeah. And they also want to say, my Disney Amboy Giri and Management of both my asshole. Hey, man. Bye. Thank you for your perspicacious observations. We have three open lines. Now as we approach that gigantic dreaded one to two hour, one in day, 751 Wiod. Starline, if you got Bell South mobility, please. I know it's Monday. I really apologize for putting the tremendous amount of pressure on the audience that I had today. I had enough common sense to come back. Like I had a Tuesday or Wednesday, would have displayed a much greater amount of class in my part. I apologize. North Miami. Hello. Hello, there. Welcome back. Thank you, sir. I think God was in my son. I think I had the same guy inside of me that you did over there. Really? Yeah. The surgeon? The wine? Dr. Unger? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was in my son. I had a couple of operations to see operated on me. Really? Yep. I'll be damned. Well, I was learning if the person who recommended him to you was a good friend or not so good friend.

You've faced down around years like yet. The game is reaching. It's really stupid. We're just enjoying it. Are they like in the building today? I did notice that on... Was it last Friday?

I'm glad you made it back in one piece. Well, thanks so much. And at least a couple of pieces anyway. I can't believe the management in that place. Huh. That is disgusting. Believe it. Believe it. I can't believe it. Yeah. They may not be good but they're consistent. They're consistently indifferent toward anything. That is... Was no excuse for that. Now you understand. Now you understand when they were... They had me doing the 9.30 to 10. And I said to them, it's too much stress and I can't do this. And I'm just telling you, I'm trying to explain it. You follow. They don't relate to that. They don't comprehend anything on a human level. They're not capable of doing it. Unbelievable. Neil, you couldn't make enough money. Believe me. Right. Once you're creep. Yeah. Anyway, you mentioned before, confessions of a medical heritage. Dr. Robert Mendelssohn. Well, I was in the car driving home Saturday night. And it happened to have a radio accident.

I'm not You have to take care of yourself and just Drink plenty of juice. Did you see the thing on 60 minutes last night? No, I missed it. They had a thing on 60 minutes about the California Medical Board and about how they absolutely Refuse to take away any doctor's license and they had this one doctor Boggs who has been convicted of murder and Bootering up all these other people and he's still got a license to practice and his asses in jail for murder. I think doctors are the The lowest form of life Yeah, some of them most of them I should they're only up for the money and their lifestyles. I mean Everything you can out of the public. I mean the public is so stupid the public has been so brainwashing Brainwashing that's what Bob Mendelssohn used to write about about the do you know about was like a temple when you go in and the doctors were in the the white Smok just like the priest wears his outfit in the room. It's just power that they wheeled over you and then he Not your Sydney singer is the name George was a do-man He's the one I was on with the night rhythms excellent. I mean I could have listened for hours But everything you said me all is so true and all these senior citizens down here who are hooked on like 75 different Prescription drugs that are interacting with each other and got them all spaced out and got to build it up in the morning and A pill to go to bed at night and a pill to be able to sleep and a pill to be able to have a BM and a pill to be able to I Mean it's just on bowl. I'm just refused to listen they just want to go to the doctor give him their money Let the doctor give them a description come home and and you know My advice is get a second opinion and a third opinion and then they'll be skeptical stay away from doctor's period right Like I said the only the only reason to visit a hospital or a doctor's if you're bleeding to death or you have a broken bond Right and if you weren't winning I think that's it. Yeah, okay Have a great day. Take care. Good luck right you too. 11 after one at Wio D.

Hello. Hi Neil. Hi I'm glad to hear your back. I was on the case and found out when I came back to you in the hospital Yeah, well, I was only supposed to be there for a day or two at the most. This is a little you know They give you a song in a dance. It's a very minor procedure. It's a piece of cake They make the four little incisions. They snip it out and a lot of people walk out They go home the same day or the next day, but guess what not everybody's the same Well, I hate the birthed your bubble The three years ago three years ago. I had mine yanked out. Yeah, I knew the old fashion one. Oh, yeah, yeah Yeah, that's my place Well, my stones were too big to crush yeah, and so they had to take it out manually So 10 days in the hospital all day days. Oh, I can't I can't imagine 10 days. I can't imagine that and I can't imagine the bill either that must be like $50,000 17,732 that's awesome. That's not much that was just a hospital must be the little rentist Yeah Anyway, I still can't eat it Arnold. It still kills me really Drums me insane a can't eat that can't eat pizza with wine Drives my stomach crazy. Well, how long ago was it out three years ago? And they tell me they tell me I have post gallbladder syndrome It's only supposed to last up to six months after you've had it yanked out Yeah, I'm working on three years and I still have it. Oh, man wouldn't have been something after you have it out And then you still got problems with all that stuff. That's right. I still I'm the biggest thing is cinnamon Canning anything with me. I love cinnamon. I do canning cinnamon rolls canning anything with cinnamon in it So don't be surprised if you don't have some problems because they warned me I haven't had it. I mean, well, see I don't mean I'm so incoherent that I really don't know if I have problems Anything can I I gotta tell you a little thing I don't want to sound like a hypochondrick, but you know after you have something in your body that you're allergic to right Until it gets out of your system when you eat Even if the problem has subsided when you eat it starts like a chemical reaction in your body again And the and the allergy starts up again So on Wednesday or whatever day it was Wednesday night I went through this horror with this penicillar was allergic to and the rash and the Screaming scratching and the hives so the Thursday It had subsided pretty well by lunchtime I had lunch and about 20 minutes after lunch all of a sudden it starts again Yeah, and I thought oh this can't be happening to me So I took a benadryl and by the way Cheryl thank you. Cheryl suggested I take a benadryl She'd called me because benadryl is for allergies and I even thought about it And I love benadryl it works very well on me so 20 minutes after all the itching went away Six hours later. I have dinner Thursday night and after about a half hour after dinner It starts it comes back like the very first night. I mean with a vengeance Just the reason that happens that way is is just really not a chemical reaction actually when you eat Your body heat increases. Yeah, when your body heat increases to get rid of the food in your system It also helps that allergic reaction that you had to heat up again It was still in your system. Yeah, so anyway. I took two benadryl and 20 minutes later I was not only over the itching, but I was already in the second sleeping like a child So I say how will you for benadryl? Well, anyway. I'm still suffering me I still have problems and I still have the potting problems. I'm running to the bathroom as soon as I meet something anything Are you serious? No, no I run to the bathroom as soon as I meet no soon I have got to send you some of that great cabbage soup. I'll keep you busy the rest of the week Good luck the back door trucks forever. Okay.

Okay, now you need to get a shot of Kalua Oh Here we can such this Monday afternoon on South Florida's news traffic and weather station news talk radio 610 W I O D The opinions expressed in this program. I'm necessarily those of 610 W I O D response. I have no force I'm For three and a half years. There's a seven million people take house on every day in America And there is a night I was a zombie I was walking around I was so tired But she'd get no sleep when you come across house 124 W I O D that should explain why he looks that way here's Boker hello Yeah Uh-huh I think your phone needs the phone doctor The worst awful I'm saying the hospitals are most helpless situation the person to be placed in true I had a Lick operated out of well back and Willing me down to the operating room and I was waiting in the hallway on the journey and They put me in the wrong operating room and they started pumping me for Hercordry and Up area and then Coat find out the person between the IV and my arm With a student and Well, I was a little pin pushing to find a listen you got to learn somewhere Oh, man, I felt like a sprinkler Yeah, but I just wanted to say you know where I glad to have you back and I told those doctors and those hospitals Better to stay out on the street than being there. Hey, man. Okay. Thank you pal have a great life 125 what I do with that article. I throw it out Let me again, in case you missed the earlier part of the show recommend in the sunset and along page 3 a yesterday Reprinted from the New York Times news service Surgeons botch new technique is the headline complication's arise from procedure to remove gallbladder's and the first paragraph says surgeons who rushed to use a new technique to remove gallbladder's That's laparoscopic Surgery which is what I had without adequate training have watched many procedures So I think a real good idea before the anesthesiologist sticks that needle into the IV would be to look up at these surgeons Say by the way, how many of these have you done before and if you kind of smiles and nervously laughs at all This is the first one I Would like jump up off that table screaming and thrashing all that equipment around and take in just start stabbing people with needles and going crazy It's you're like a prisoner you're like you're like a guinea pig You're like a guinea pig in a laboratory and you're lying there first see the first thing they do is you go in and They have a little cubicle and you take off all your clothes and you fold them all up and put them with all your positions in a little plastic bag and that big kind of a company's you around Like into the ground if necessary and Then you go in a little cubicle and you put on the schmata you put on this little ridiculous gown Why it open in the back? Don't drop the soap and then they put you also put this little silly It's like a shower cap on your head Okay, and now you come out and you lay down on a table and they put the little bag like at the end of the table and You're lying there and then they stick the IV into your wrist and They start explaining to you in the anesthesiologist who by the way was a very nice girl extremely nice What do they what do they call those? They're like trainees what do they call those? Interns not known and not interns there's a Well, whatever they call them they're like learning okay and Then they had some other guy. Oh, yeah, we both listen to your show and we love you now this first thing we do Apprentice no not a predator the sorcerer is a predator's right and this first Injection we're gonna give you this first drug this first powerful mind-altering chemical We're gonna give you is going to like help you forget what's going on now? Which naturally you can imagine right off the bat they want you to forget everything They don't want you to remember any of it just in case Because you'll notice that the majority of the time what seems to be over just kind of overriding everything else It's called covering your ass. That's what they want to do against malpractice against lawsuits And I want to say this to every doctor and everybody in that profession out there in the whole wide world Don't belly ached us about the malpractice insurance rates because there's only one group of people that brought that on and that's the butchers out there who are killing people every day That's why Like the guy in California who's on who's in jail for murdering people and butchering everybody up It's still got license to practice just in case he should break out a resident a resident right a resident That's a very nice word isn't it a resident? Which means like a amateur hour, you know hey here. How do we do this? I don't know Here's the he had the event lady. Oh, no. Yeah So glad you survived. Yes. I was gonna write a novel if you didn't murder a male sign on it I'm I am serious. I could write not just a book, but in the cyclopidia of books I really could I think I've covered most of the bases today But every few minutes that goes by remember another little sorted chapter that I forgot to talk about No, you'd limited your diet or you all right. You can eat anything now I mean I can eat anything I want but when you're diabetic that doesn't mean all of a sudden you can go out and start getting fat and No, no, I mean other than your type. I mean I do know some fat people who use this operation as an excuse That I want to mention a certain fat friend by name as an excuse to start shoveling it down again Because they want to fill up that vacuum where the bladder used to be Yeah, well, if it weren't for Craig. No one would know anything Craig. Right. Thank God for Craig. Yeah, really can you believe you drove all the way down from Bocaish Let me all the way down in the rain to Mount Sinai Said in the waiting room with a hundred to ninety-year-old the dead people in there and waited for 20 minutes while I yank my Staples out.

Yeah, I'll belpettied us See yeah God she got a sense of humor today or what one thirty butcher up Ross will you please and stopping so damn insecure already God grow up We have an open line in the Broward 5241 on the out of town line 1 800 944 Wild you would have a nice to have like some dessert or something to do To late now, huh? It would have been nice to have something like that today I see can't find the remedy is wandering around out there. I don't want that kind of dessert Okay, I would like to be able to watch the ball game tonight See if we can win another one which would be a miracle That would really I don't have time to be doing the green apple quick step with those candies again. Okay, God that I just I can't believe he did that to me I just can't believe it what a moron. What a yutz. Oh Here somebody gave us this here eat this okay somebody. Yeah. Yeah, right Everybody out there in the world is looking for something. Okay, and these sales people here They're out there to give it to him or is that plastic man card or is our we still in limbo on that did they ever resolve that That's just a joke. Okay. Like I really care whether we're in limbo or not North Miami Beach. Hello Hello North Miami Beach is gone. Well, it's your loss okay. It would have been a great call. Believe me Here's a lady in Kendall. I know hi. I've been in and out of the car home morning So I don't know if somebody's mentioned this before, but if you see that will him hurt movie called the doctor? No Oh, you have to see it now. It's on it's making the rounds, isn't it? It's on video I thought I'm video a couple weeks ago. Yeah, it's about this real smart S doctor who is real flipping with his patients And all of a sudden he's got a medical problem and he has to go under the night and we see how he's created and it's a real eye opener Yeah, so after what you explained, you know, I think you would really get a kick on me I mean, I you know, wouldn't you think that like a common sense bedside manner? Oh, yeah Would be to keep people as calm and as confident as possible without getting them hysterical about I mean In addition to which before you go undergo any kind of surgery Why is it that you have to sign all these consent forms and release forms? But they don't have to tell you anything right don't tell you about any of these possibilities Who is his why when they start screaming in the hospital you start panicking because nobody ever told you about this And if you don't take deep breaths you're gonna get pneumonia So you got to get up and walk around of course if you get up and walk around then you're gonna like probably start bleeding inside and then about Well, maybe you're gonna have like pulmonary Thry embolisms and you're gonna have blood clots in your lungs Where does this all come from? I mean nobody ever gives you a clue on these things can happen? Well, what kills me is the way they treat you like six foot six year old you have to have permission to go to the bathroom Gotta wear those stupid clothes at the end of the movie. He's teaching a bunch of interns and at the end of the movie They have to get into the backless gowns and be patients know how it's how it feels Yeah, well Bob Mendelssohn used to say that that's one of the one of the reasons they do that is to put you on the defensive and and give them as much power over you as possible I know that you feel like you're walking around almost stark naked all the time and you do I've only been in the hospital for childbirth. So believe me that was enough I don't ever want to do that again. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Yeah, plus what they charge you my gosh That was an experience. I just you know cross my fingers. I'll never get an actual illness if they could have taken any more blood out of me They could have filled up a bathtub and here I got this one doctor who is absolutely hysterical he's taken blood tests every five minutes to see if my blood counts going back up How can your blood count go back up when they keep taking a quarter blood every five minutes? Oh, you know, I killed me the last two last time it was in there. I had a baby amic I was already dismissed. It was the morning after I was getting ready to leave in the guy comes in to take blood What do you need to form going home? Oh, well, we have to have it for a record Right, so we can get that one last charge on at bill that's right. Okay. It's hard you up the nose How to rate day go see that movie now. I will I'll do it.
