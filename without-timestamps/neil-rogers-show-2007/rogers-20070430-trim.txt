I want to win. I want to win. I don't get things to go through it and will do that. It takes all of it i go through, will you. and all I want to win is pretty good. one after don't care. That's not too good. Almost 30%. But it's kind of a mixed bag, you know? And a lot of people, especially with a proper ganda, you're hearing on this radio station and more, you know, Kimba, for a big guy, he's so easy. You know, the way he sold out. Oh, I was pretty upset after it happened. I heard Ted Ginn. Everybody was like filming at the mouth. In fact, I have a who's calling as I've got in here. Oh, yeah, great code text from the Harold. He says that Dick was a personal foul against the fans. How do you like that? Greg Kotek, who doesn't know my answer from your elbow, but nevertheless, he rips him an ass. A personal foul against the fans. And for once in your life, Greg, I'd have to say you're absolutely correct. And not just because Brady Quinn is pretty, you know? And a lot of guys say, oh, he's overrated. He's not going to be so good. We'll see. Not that Cleveland's going to be winning those superables. And that's something to get picked 20 second. Chris, that must have been a real bloat of his ego, you know? Of course. 20 second. Sit there, pick after pick after pick after pick and don't hear your name. Although all the commentators on TV are like, they were jumping on the ceiling and on the walls. They were so psychotic. Man, Chris Birmingham was filming at the mouth. I thought he was doing a damn to let phomey spot. And they don't even, they even still make you let phomey. I sure hope not as far as I know. What kind of guy's shape with that old fashing kind of shaving cream like you know, starvice. Oh, yeah. Like you are starvice. Oh, there you go. And there's old, what do you call those things? See the shaving brush and the customer. That's what I was thinking of the shaving brush and the barbice on. Did you let blue blade would be good too? You bet. Oh, it's a little bit crazy. Feel sharp. I think that's the thing. Of course. Okay, raise it. Okay, blade. That's it. Game blade. Eight hundred sixty one votes on our world famous pool. I wouldn't, I just can't believe that the public is that all of it's not for you know. They're used to being beaten down and all of the stuff. They're used to being beaten up and screwed over and led down the garden pan. But we'll she'll, we'll she'll so hard that'll make our brains bleed. That's how much we want those dolphins baby. Kids baby. Yeah. There's an offensive nightclub. She reads her overcoat there. She calls to get the jacket back inside Paris is pockets. Some of the the calls. A pocket rocket. There is. How often do you use your pocket rock? Uh-huh. I don't think it's important. I'm going to make people feel better. You know what's coming up in January? It's like that. Since you are sick, I have any other sexual devices. I'm just trying to get out of my seats. That's what you want. One thing about Paris. She's almost attracted as Brady Quinn's pastie blonde girlfriend. They're the tech-ept show on the road. Not quite. Almost. Anyway, here's a couple of facts. One says, and we're not, I'm not anything these things here. It says, can you add to the pool? I'm happy but then again, I'm a jet fan. See, I could put unhappy, then again, I'm a Patrex fan. I could put that on the floor to other teams in league. But we're not going to do that. Are we? No. Also, here's one. Can you add to the pool? I was originally furious where Grooter were accepted. No, we can't do that. Then it says him, see, here's, this is call, and this is from University Dodge. Must be from Wolfgang for his boyfriend up to Street there. It says 21 other teams passed on and there has to be a reason. Maybe because those teams didn't need the unquarterback. A franchise quarterback to like build a franchise around. Like the dolphins have needed since Moorino hung it up. And they've gone through a succession of really brutal, just pathetic. Of course, they're thinking about getting trained green. We just turned 85 in Kansas City. They're thinking maybe they might get him. But then again, they might not, you know, etc. 894 votes on it pool. I don't want to like sound like some kind of an expert because I, you know, not going to change my life. What? I think I'm sure about it only marginally more than you do. Wow. People sin. Oh, well, Neil Rogers is going to be all pissed off because he loves Brady Quinn. Yes. So what about it? I'm not going to be down there. I'm not going to go to no stupid games. Am I going to get to meet him to take a shower with him in a locker room? Of course not. Although I'll be honest with you. I sure look a lot. Lovelyer than that blonde headed. That's terrible. That's it. I don't. I wish I did though. I would like to take a shower of Brady Quinn. I hope you know, if you know, I just, but I can go to Cleveland do that. And that's a lot closer than Miami. You know, there. What? And I never thought about that. I can just hop on a highway and get the where you go right down there through Buffalo and the P.U. and Fredonia and Duncirk and get on the. Turn right over. Huh? I said, all right. You know, you're right over Cleveland. In fact, I don't want to go to Cleveland either. I was in that stadium once. I'll know it's not the same stadium. Is it Chris? I think I've no stadium in Cleveland. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I'll, well, how long were you there? Oh, 1961. Oh, yeah, they haven't even stadium. This was old municipal stadium all brother and the winter time and it was snowing and freezing and everybody was passing the bottle of booze around and the bleachers because it was nasty. The NAACP held us in Balafumeral in Detroit, in the 1962 years ago for Jim Crow. Where's that for Jim Bean? The civil rights organization will do the same this summer for the N word, the Reverend Wendell Anthony Savius. They're going to bury the N word. Yeah, that's right. They got to bury it. Anthony present the civil rights organization's Detroit grants that members and supporters of the NAACP will conduct services and the Ulogy for the racial slur. The Machuero will be held during the NAACP National Convention July 7th, 2012 in Detroit. He said, what a better place to bury the N word than in Detroit. All I could tell you stories about Detroit and none of them are really, very, pretty either, just like the city, not very, pretty, pretty depressing. When it down, burn it down. We're committed to ending hate word and talk Anthony said it doesn't do anyone any good, whether it's a journalist on TV or rougher on the radio. I'm raf it on the radio. Oh, look at that. We actually got into an Al-Ride. Let's hear it for Brian Schmuss. We finally got a piece of copy that we've needed for like a couple of weeks and we find a better late than ever. Brian, better late than ever boy. What happened to him? He got married. Is that what happened? Yeah, he's a good wife. We've got a sweetheart so we can't blame her. What is that kind of? Maybe we'll even screw him up. Maybe. Maybe she won't put up with all his baby around on the side or stuff like that or maybe out of animal. He won't put up with hers. Anyway, the announcement comes on this, so bearing the end word, if we can get back to that pleasing, forget about Brian Schmuss. The announcement comes after we knew discussion nationally about racial incensivity brought on by Don I'm a sister, a tour of comments about blood, not like members of the workers in universities. Women's basketball team, Nappy headed hose. And it says here, I'm a student used the inward in those comments, but he did use a different word, Nappy. Right? How about a Nappy, Pappy? Okay. Nappy, Edittal. But was fired at early April by CBS Radio N and BC after major companies including GM, pulled their advertising spots, like a leopard. They changed their spots. How about that spot? We've got for the heat playoff tickets. Exactly. That's what I was saying when I heard it. I thought, ah, now the corporate America's caught up. Maybe something will happen, Anthony. He said, we have to stop investing and stuff that is killing us. Jim Crow was a systematic mostly seven practice of discrimination against incensivity or blacks from the end of possible over construction in the middle of the middle of the 20th century. Yeah, in the mid 20th century, my ass, right? Whatever you say, here's another facts. It says, now I already, it didn't just get you saying that I had a spuyring port on this ball. We need to get all the evidence against her happy. I'll read it again. It says, I have a spuyring port from the draft coverage on Saturday on QM. Mad Dog said to the crowd, if Miami picks Brady Quinn, your wages will become the biggest dolphin fan out of the crowd. Had no reaction. Mad Dog said, man, that went over like a lead balloon. I would guess you didn't have too many fans in that crowd. It says, they didn't even know what they'll, that meant, you know, or they probably even know who the hell was. See that. That's one of the reasons on this for sure. It was all over the ass in there. I noticed Kenny this morning was sucking up a little bit. You know, all you'll probably pretty upset about that. Oh, yeah. I'm real upset about it. Kenny, I'm real upset about Brady Quinn, I'm being on the dolphins. Who cares, you know, grow up. You people grow up. So there was no crowd reaction to that, huh? And you wanted to know why because it was a kind of a gay. Yeah, that's right. And when you got a bunch of juxtaphyrs around the last thing you wanted to make some kind of a gay reference in addition, which they didn't pick him any how. And then you talk about the sounds of silence, then everybody's jaw dropped to their ankle. It was one thing when your jaw drops to your knee, their jaws dropped to their ankles. So that ain't been proud. The crowd at the dolphin thing, uh, boot. Now I know that. I was given to that if you're just not step on my ankles. They boot loudly and they were pissed off and fired up and they're all about Brady, Brady, and Cam Cameragop there and they boot his ass, baby. And then I don't think they were booting the choice of just that name. You know, what kind of a name is that Cam Cameragop. It's like, you know, it's like like Rod Roddy. Remember him? Who? He was the announcer after Johnny Olsco, or Francis Wright Rod Roddy, big fat user with those socks that he bought in Thailand. And we used to go to Thailand to clean the jewelry rentals told me back in the road. He was that he was gay. Yeah. Yeah. He was buying more than silk suits in Thailand. If you catch my drift, I'll tell you. Follow the bouncing balls. Okay. Rod Roddy, he weighed about 800 pounds and now he's dead. So Bob Barker's going to retire like, uh, and tomorrow's the first to me. So I guess we can almost say next month, meaning in June. Bob Barker's probably going to hang up that microphone. Oh, Jason, five Johnny Olsson and Rod Roddy and whoever the new stiff they got on there. I don't know who it is. What is George tenon on there from late? Say slam dunk to go to war. Yeah, slam dunk this. Okay. Slime dunk to bad the heat didn't hear about the yesterday. What? They got slam dunk. Things just don't look into it. How the marlins do them, by the way. Any interest in that Chris? Are they winning any games or what? How the panthers doing they have it lost to playoff game this season in a long time? They're playing the playoff, huh? Exactly. Marlins? Oh, they lost six to one. I believe. No, no. Oh, no. What a bad weekend in South Florida sports boys and girls. Panthers didn't get them playoff so they didn't win no game. Marlins lost to them. Who they play is today? Washington. They lost to it. No, I'm sorry. I thought I was going to fill it. Oh, the fulfillment of the affiliates. Yeah, they were a hit list through like six and six. Yeah, that's right. I've seen that they got no hitter gone for six. And then, uh, and the heat of course got bushwacked. Oh, well, they really stuck the joint out there in the last few minutes of that game. They just collapsed like I said, like an accordion. Fold it up like a freaking accordion baby, like accordion shutters. And I shuttered a think at the hostility. In fact, when we come back, I'm going to read that grid code text. The pick was a personal foul against the fans. A personal foul. Don't you feel foul? George? Huh? Don't you feel like you've been, uh, a few months later, and just had hours and bacon for how he's used and I'm going to call the carine. Tath. That's right. Who cares? 9-11 by the way, 9-11 votes on the pool. So I guess you've been less easy. We're going to make a thousand on this. I still say we don't have 5,000 votes, but just like that thing about Mad Dog and that crowd, they don't know for me. They don't want nothing to do with me. Oh, that faggot. He's got the hot spread that kid from Notre Dame. Well, we don't care about that. We don't care if he looks good. So you have to have a thing. He's too pretty to play with the dolphins. Now, Marino, he wasn't a bad looking guy except for the lifts. He had those remember the a Joker in Batman? Those are Danny Boy's lifts. He's got very bizarre like a bat and like a Joker lifts, you know. But he could throw it a ball a little bit. He could play a little Danny Boy and before we start doing those new true system spots. Well, he's slimed anyway. It weighs about 6 pounds now. They got Danny in a, in a jar now. Danny's like in a, in a pickle jar. You know, those last sick pickle jar is I'm sure you do. Oh, yeah. Danny's hanging out in there right now. Until it gains a little weight back. Well, he maybe overdid a little bit. Like, I wasn't in Christy, Ellie. She lost 400 pounds. She still a cow. Have you seen those spots? Hey, a cow and Jenny, yeah. Any cow? Yeah. I'm going to call a gentleman. Tell her you look like her cow, Christy. You, oh, brother. You, you're fairy. Well, she's a son, dog. She's got an excuse. She's got issues. 19 till 11 at 5, 60, WDQ and let's take a quick look at that line of mad dog at broken sound today to a clock. What, what does that mean? Broken sound. What, what is that? I don't know. Chris. No idea. Jim, andage at broken sound. Huh. Mad dog and him, um, um, or four to five in the power hour, then Hank solo 5 to 6 35. Don't let me forget we got that derby thing coming up this weekend. A better little homework. I'm, I'm a homework. Marlon side deck at 6 35. Marlon's at at the Met 705. Try to win a game or two. And then a game. Ident kau at 10 30 or whatever after the Marlon loss, a game and then again. Tom as Thor and Latinny and Danny, uh, Spec- Gene and Danny. Danny and Danny. Danny and Danny and Danny. Danny and Danny. Sunday. We have a mobile from Miramar, hello. Can you hear me? Oh, I got a question about Jimmy and Danny's situation. Yeah, Jimmy and Danny. Jimmy and Danny? A Jimmy and Danny. Baby, what baby? Jimmy and Danny and Danny. Jimmy and Danny and Danny. Jimmy and Danny and Danny. Jimmy and Danny and Danny and Danny. About Jimmy and Danny after this word from Valley Alombs of Opp Hotzons where every of Hotzons comes with its own frigid ad. before 11 a Q a m. W Q a m hello. Pretty quick line. Oh yes. Hi, is Q a m? Yes sir. Very good. I'd like to get on the air top of the book. Talk with boog? Yeah. What are you talking about man? I don't know. I don't know. What? Boog? I know. Who's on the air right now? Is it boog? Let me ask you something. What's the last time you had a good bowel movement? I'm not sure. What is it? Yeah, well go check because I think you're full of it. Boogon. That must have been Joel Finder. Very funny, Joel. What time is you a show on? So here's some inside information speaking of the radio business. Oh, I don't forget Friday is the book coming out. And don't worry. I trust this organization. Okay. I trust them to make the right choices and the right decisions. Not. So you know the mysterious mice face person with a palm tree, the Miami person, whoever that is. Yeah. Who doesn't have a name. He sends me this. He says I can't verify if this is true, but it was posted online from all access.com. Bruce Kelly, do we place Rick Shaw and Mommy? Who's Bruce Kelly? I wonder if he's kind of Jin Kelly. I've heard of it. Or I don't know. This marks as we turned to trust your radio as well as to Miami where he worked at one time at Tom Forty, 96 and also at Y100. Kelly begins May 14. It says following a huge listener appreciation party for Shaw that will take place at Velstein Park. I'm Friday May 11th to benefit the magic children's fund. So Rick, Tiki is only a couple weeks away from returning court of this. Maybe he'll call him to they or not. He'll never get it. How come he never gave him our bat line so we'd know it was him. It never came up in the grass. Be happy to hear. Because the history of retaining employees for long term, it says much of the honor and support staff of work to the station for 10 to 20 years. They were ready in radio. Bruce Kelly. I have no idea who that is. Did you ever hear him? Nope. How about you Chris and her Bruce Kelly? No. No. But I would only somebody did. WDQAM Hello. May Neil the morning. Yes sir. Can't I see a National Geographic Channel? No. Well, they. WDQAM Hello. Welcome and Neil and children. 560. This is the reaction of our audience after a weekend from hell. A weekend in which people are forming at the water cooler. They're taking buckets of water and splashing all over each other's head. That's how forming at the mouth they are. And this is the reaction the same as it always is. Ask me if I'm surprised. Are you surprised? No. WDQAM Hello. Hey, who is this? Who you con? Chris, it's Bob. Yeah, okay. Greg Co. Text. This pic was a personal follow against the fans. This was bizarre, awkward, non-presentated in the long-frowth history of South Florida's flagship flagships for franchise. Adolfins had coach walked into a crowd, the crowded angry room of fans on draft day and got booed for number one pic made, rather not made just minutes earlier. The sound was visceral spike with cat calls. Another combustible cocktail was nearly a decade of inability to find the next grade quarterback in five consecutive seasons out of the playoffs, chased now by a first round draft decision that was stunning. Dumb founding says Greg Co. Text. Dumb founding. Dumb founding. Well, in fact, how the thumbs down gesture is new coach came, camons to their mid-deventing. Hey, we need to go in this direction the coach called in a microphone with as much brightness as he could muster. Bravely venturing it up for it's thumb is the boo's and hectoring continued. You want a bright side? At least it was only a thumb game to camon. It might have been a digit more central located on the hand, given Miami's first round performance in Las NFL draft and Dull fans reaction to it. The day had unfolded ideally, a best case scenario is noted in quarterback Brady Quinn, but further than expected, was available to Miami at number nine. At that point, you would expect that Al Michael's to burst into the Dull fans' war room screaming, do you believe in miracles? And last, it often was reported draft their first round quarterback since some guy named Dan Moreno in 1983. Finally, a club would make an investment in the future, young franchise quarterback and then Ted Ginn Jr. Huh? What? That's what it says here. It says, Huh? What? And you thought the heat's three and I'll play off serious deficit to Chicago was shocking. No, this was shocking. How about their four game sweep loss? This was news that made the job come unhinged. News that made you turn wide eye to whoever was near you and say something in the neighborhood of a, are you finkitting me or it says bleeping? But I'm sure. Are you bleeping kidding me? Bleeping. Yeah. I can't remember a bigger South Florida bombshell since Jimmy Johnson, a brother of the hurricane to join Jerry Jones. Hostile Dallas Cowboys, overthrow town land with E9. Ted Ginn Jr. And Ohio State receiver expected to be picked much later in the round, nursing a four month old foot injury, still not fully healed, going to a team that already has a number on receiver and Chris Chambers playing a position line we could have easily filled in round two a receiver for the most desperately quarterback needy team in the league. Five known as family for ten years Cameron told the crowd no sale, more booing. He maybe Ginn's dad can play quarterback. Team owner Wayne Hizing us to groomly off of the side is Cameron addressed the hostile constituency armistful to the cross to his chest. After earlier of Cameron and GM Rand him, Mueller were right in choosing Ginn over Quinn. The owner had said, turtley, they'd better be right. Ginn himself was shocked to be selected over Quinn. For sure he admitted in the conference call. You know him I'm he's hurting for a quarterback right now and Brady's a great quarterback. Eventually the Cleveland Browns traded up to select Quinn in number 22 giving her first round pick in the 2000 giving up her first round pick in the 2008 draft. The Baltimore Ravens had planned to hope to select in later in Saturday's first round. Why did Quinn fall at all? Some called him overhyped as any noted name quarterback who looks like Mr. All-American pretty boys bound to be and some question is accuracy. Hmm, this kid through 67 touchdown passes against 14th of a set of sessions of fast two seasons in accurate. He topped 60% both those years. Graphnik's raven for about his poison potential about how coming from a pro style college offense makes him NFL ready. The admirers include quarterback experts like Steve Young. You're fairly. Bottom line, the offense had a chance to satisfy their priority most pressing need with the first round quarterback and often instead for an injured receiver. You can spin that anyway you wanted some extremely odd pick at best. The necessary caveat, of course, is that none of us knows on draft they have been any play will be in a year or three. Unfortunately, my deadline this column was last night in 2010. He writes, You can say Quinn might be a bust another Rick Meyer as easily as you say, again, might disappoint you. And you go without saying there are no guarantees. So you start by measuring need and quarterback clearly was a big one and then you measure upside what might be. Again, could be another Santana Law. So receiver, also re-afast receiver who also returns kicks. Quinn could be another Tom Brady, which of these possibilities would you prefer, which enticing maybe was a smarter gamble for Miami? You know the answer to the evening if the dolphins didn't answer today. Nobody sang Quinn is the next end. Reno, the thing he might be. The second round selection of V out by you quarterback John Beck only partly mitigates the error and bypassing the much greater prospect and Quinn. At some point this franchise needs to stop for long on a continuing series of mediocre stopgaps like Jay Feeler, thus for Rod and now presumably old Trent Green. At some point this franchise needs to roll the dice in the draft on a franchise quarterback. On long-term future, if this most vital position Saturday was that chance, it would be as fumbled. It felt like a very big mistake. One Miami might regret for a long time, where it's where it's co-text in the anxious Miami hear it. This is the Neal Roger show. This is your brain.

Oh, and it often's bluer everybody not a blowing going on Speak of that hundreds of protesters gathered the Kendall Dave college campus where president Bush folks That are the afternoon roughly 200 protesters were clustered new temporary fences and estimated 600 of them They get a spent the better part of the afternoon marching and holding signs along a main road near the college campus Well, that's a good start, you know In peaceful will be better, but the swimming the on about it can't be all bad The protest is where commemorating national impeachment day with the peaceful march while Miami police looked on The president was escorted in and out of the campus to an entrance on the far side of the campus where he couldn't see the protest So, of course, we'd allow him to feel bad Too narrow and certainly you don't want him to feel bad about all those dead people as a result of his decisions and lies Too proble supporters wrote their bicellers in front of the protesters screaming commies, but by and large The rally drew a few administration supporters commies Communists that communists that communista that's what they were screaming right right National impeachment day was organized by a large coalition of center-round left-assender groups including a 28 Democrats dot com and progressive Democrats former for the protesters Hi, I didn't focus only on the topic of impeachment, but also on reasons for impeachment carrying sign such as Out of Iraq and no blood for oil The oily bird gets to warm. It's a soft photo kind of a thing the oily bird as in 1979 the pool this half hour we're gonna go over a thousand then there's no limit then there's no holding us back Oh, yeah, they got this big thing about the DC madham and all the all the big good DC people on her list They're all the across the 2000 and they're clients these questions will come in time. Oh, yeah, well, so will the customers too Are you gonna what this just move right along that way? I'm loaded for bear today, man After this very traumatic sports weekend And the damn Rangers won a game too. Oh, and overtime and double overtime. They beat buffalo Well, what can I tell you nothing is perfect Less taste more fillers question mark this is from a son similarly and how are we talking about different kinds of foods in cramp Mm-hmm the headline and this chocolate hollocks in the upper over proposed change and recipe of sweet treats You can't miss with our chocolate is rain-eaten would say it's got to be chocolate Not an argument over like beer. It says here by chocolate Say it right chocolate not chocolate chocolate you idiots Chocolate hollocks and high-end candy makers are wild by a proposal before the FDA to allow America's favorite treat to be made with vegetable oil instead of natural cocoa butter Don't mess with my chocolate said Charlie Paul a sweet sliver from plantation lingering Friday outside kill winds in four-larodale They're always saying you can't eat this. You can't do that. What's good? Leave it alone. That's right. You go, Darius. Surely whatever your name is The issue is touched off a buzz among chocolate purists and others who say the football change could fool consumers in the paying full price for Artificially and daughter-rated chocolate and I reconstituted and candy might dilute chocolate's possible health benefits Christ can't they leave anything alone for a crown out loud for Jesus Christ on all mighty motor sake God it pisses me off. They're always dittlin with stuff, man The fusco's back to January when the trade group grocery manufacturers of America as the FDA to change the definition of what can be labeled chocolate Companies could use vegetable oil now instead of cocoa butter which is now required to make chocolate and also substitute milk proteins for whole milk Well, what does that mean? I don't know It is that like that fake cheese like cheese product. How about chocolate product? You know what real talk to them, but it's chocolate-ish Like it's Jesus. Jesus Christ But that's Brian Murray talking other spokesman. Jesus Christ we Watch the game And it also came to New Jersey the oh, I'm sure you're following those Santa Capals very religiously, aren't you? What if I have to your dare and paying one more time? I am gonna get violent. I'm gonna go to guns. I'm gonna find out where he is That was a call. He didn't kick it in. I was I know he kicked it in you idiot. It was pretty damn obvious to anybody He was ever watched the hockey game before. He was a little bald head and geek you more on you figure skater. You're simple then Between him and Pierre McGuire, man, which bald head needs to be taken out first? The proposals got to backing by the way if we can get back to the chocolate store and get out of your hockey talk Backing on the chocolate manufacturers of market led by Hershey Nestle and others who say it will be a flexibility making new products Well, maybe it's not so bad at all although of course Hershey what they make. Oh, you call that chocolate. Oh, I do like what's the one we like with the toffee and nuts? Oh the almond Tafey Whatever it is. Yeah, and then you've also got a score Hershey bar. Did you know that? Oh no. Yeah, they do See here we go again. Why did you do this? Why the chocolate pile? It's sabotage man. It's sabotage There are high quality walls available, which are equal to or better than cocoa butter and taste nutrition texture and function And our preferred by consumers Hershey spokesman Kirk Simil told they hers were paid for news in the company's backyard In the company's backyard But some especially What does that mean? But some specialty cannon makers and some photo call the idea sell out in the travesty same cocoa butter makes up about a fourth of chocolate But cost more than three times as much as vegetable oil. Oh, it's on a cheap again, okay? This is all a question a money said Fred Meltzer, a corner of Hoffman's chocolates and green acres with seven stores If they can take something and dilute it and it's still got the taste for a fraction of the cost that's what they want But the taste isn't the same he and other said if you've ever did from a chocolate fountain which cascades Equify chocolate from bolder bowl. You're probably even vegetable overriding Your all thin so we can now flow through the machine You'd just be instead of the difference in taste. They're just not comparable to Jean Hammond a coordinator for killins a potassium Michigan chain with seven stores and South Florida never heard of it Did you kill ones? No Killins makes a chocolate compound with vegetable oil. I franchise them. They use but only for icing him and said just a little bit of vegetable oil changes the mouth feel It makes it taste a waxy. Oh, waxy. Oh fat And said we take chocolate just very very seriously chocolate is not good enough and actually says that here in the story chocolate the issue is not good enough That's like guys who were like, you know In the closet Which is I see my hair wash yeah I throw those set Hoffman's melts. We are wholeheartedly against this proposal. It's not chocolate for Christ's If Katie with vegetable oil could be labeled as chocolate consumers would have to read the fine print to figure out what they were getting Melted and so would be misled led down the garden path But what if it's made what it's made of is the key to whether chocolate's got any health benefit nutritionists say Serval studies have suggested but not proven the chocolate may protect the heart and arteries because of flavonoids got no water I'm so healthy Plant compounds from the cacao bean that contain antioxidants Also cocoa butter does not raise cholesterol as other fats do and it has no artery clogging trans fats But any benefits stem from cacao which tasted bitter said sheer rare back and nutritionists that you have medical school Dark chocolate contains at least 70% cacao and some I sweet about 45% Milk chocolate things about 36% mixed with whole milk and sugar the jack up the fat and calories She said candy makers and put out new products with higher levels of cocoa touting health benefit If the sugar doesn't kill you then the other stuff will Some of the fat and cocoa butters unsaturated relatively healthy for the heart but some is saturated riskier She said chalk that made with vegetable oil would be about the same People shouldn't really worry about the type of fatty acid they're getting our backs said I would rather have to make concern with how many fruits and vegetables they have yeah We consider about those fruits too fari I'm in it all for the orbital postal employee Jill Schmater who was buying caramel apples Friday at Kilvans shrugged at the great chocolate debate I if I like the flavor I don't care too much about a tomato of Schmater said What if Schmater is related related to Schmendric and Schilmao's lunch mega you think so could be often the same family Jill Schmater 997 votes and a full-acted a grateful have a thousand and that's easy That's the point in the show which we just kind of sit back take a deep breath in a thigh and a thigh of relief And just relax okay, because we got a maiden shade Did we ever figure out what broken sound is that like some kind of a golf thing or what is that? I have a few lines Seriously now it says Jim managed at broken sound Well somebody please somebody the building please tell us what that is Topans I Playing badly And some of the left that are right over the radio dials free You They are the last remaining Remember that he was not being carried off the field in the in the stretcher The other team is just walking around the field of looking for somebody to play How about it Jim Wanna go play with them?

I'm thinking, geez. Oh, and I pulled it out real quick. How are you? I know. What? Huh? Power suggestions. Right. 1077. And the nose and not. Right. And some place else. Anyway, that guy that called him in to go, oh, would you be in a better mood today? I'm in a great mood. Okay. I'm in a fabulous mood. Life is great. Everything is coming up roses. Everything smells real good. Like, lil' ox. I'm going to go to Rochester this summer. You think? No. No. Do you know, remember they had that, um, I told you about that. Ferry. You're fair. From Toronto to Rochester, across Lake Ontario. I think that thing ran about a half dozen times in the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, Schmidt-Candon. You wanted to why? Why? Well, we're, we're, we're there more people in Toronto or in Rochester. Gee Toronto? Yeah. And so, obviously, for that thing to succeed, there'd have to be a whole lot of people going from here. And they're right. Well, right. I want to go to Rochester. As the people on the way back from going to Toronto. Evidently, nobody wants to go to Rochester, including me. If they had to go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Boy, you don't, you haven't lived it. It had done a Bob's. Oh, boy. Right next to my L.M. free school. I think it's a child I was destined to be fed. You know, if you have fat jeans when you're a kid, you better watch it, Mr. Cause you're going to mind a fat. Let me see how much I can, oh, geez, I'm fat. So, did I tell you about that ice cream? Yeah. Oh, stop. Stop already. Now, this John bursting article, Gulf Stream Park slots it by slump. See, did this, you know what it's like? It's like how you know there are there. They always talk about location, location, all this other stuff. And how there are some like places in strip shopping malls where they go out of business over and over again. It's just a bad location. Remember, pony tail, I tried to warn them about that place in plantation, bad location, and on this station. But he would listen to me. Not there, no, no, no. He bailed out of it. And then I guess the other guy bailed out. Not even there, no, no, no, right behind Walgreens. Mm-hmm. For, for while I'm eating. I think that is, of course, that particular location. You can't see it from the street because it's hidden by Walgreens. And it's, it's just, you know, you don't know what's there. And Gulf Stream, like most of the other fair motiles, but probably the worst of Fender. Gulf Stream, the median age was death plus 40, okay? I mean, for years and years, you heard Hank screaming and carrying on about. That's just before he does this, but that's okay. At least he's being honest about that. That's good, huh, perky, no man. By the way, talk about fan. I'm, you know, something, I'm always taking your word for it. This weekend, I'm going to get to see him because he'll be on the, or wait a minute. Does ABC, I don't think they have the derby, do they? I don't know. Doesn't NBC have it now? I really can't keep track. I think NBC's got it. And that awful Tom Hamid will be on there with the white hair. Oh, geez. But anyway, I better start doing my homework for the derby. I was going to say I was going to get to, he'll be on the ESPN. Won't he? Chris, he'll be on the ESPN for the derby coverage. Most definitely. In fact, let me take a puke here and look. Oh, yes, see that? Thursday. Oh, jelly at the dolphins of word bank. What, oh my God. And then, yeah, Friday, 80K from Vegas, all the way to his power hour with Hank and Maddo. I don't understand that. This whole schedule, I think Chris was on acid when he was making this up. I'll see him on there somewhere. And I want to see if he, if my sandstone 46 inch will hold the hump around the screen. If it does, I'll feel a little bit better. Because he's diabetic. He put the die in diabetic, you know what I mean? And you're not doing very much to help save him. Oh, you gave up on that a long time. Yeah, but then you know me, you gave better. You expect to be in my will and you won't even try to prevent me from eating me. I said listen, I told you I'd hire the goon. Of course, you got to pay for it. I don't have goon money. Don't you know what makes you think I got to goon money? Especially after wood buying. Oh, I don't think I even got to mention now, although we do get off Wednesday. We do get off Wednesday early at 1230 being early with my Wednesday. I'll ride. I have a good time there. So I lost see in the beginning. Haven't gone through almost three years now. And in the beginning, like this guy said before, or you'd be in a better mood. Yeah, I used to get really pissed off. I'm never going there again and place their robbing. But if you've got the money and it's not going to change your lifestyle, you're not gambling away any way that you really need. What if there's a make? Right? Right. Now the money that I lost in Saturday, I'm sure that you had been much happier if I would have just put an envelope in the house. But I went through with the idea that I was going to win or at least break the course. That's a good idea. I didn't go there with the idea that oh, I'm going to lose a couple of grand today. And therefore I should mail a couple grand a George. So you can feed his family. Listen, whatever it takes for me to get that most precious gift that you give me every day. Every week morning. Every weekday morning. Every weekday morning he comes in there and they're I am. That's it. And he thinks oh, he's. And let me ask you this quite I'll get to this article eventually, but we got two more hours. That's an interesting thought. Now I'm not kind of what I'm in pretty good health. I feel great. I really do. I feel excellent. Couldn't have been all that screwing around. I did this weekend. Oh, that might have something to do with it. But anyway, well, that helps. Doesn't it? Sure. Helps foot upright smile on your face. Right. And the fact that the sun is shining and subunitable. They man, it's going to be like 60. They said 63. I think it's going to all pan to four and you're showing the pan to is doing it. I don't want to see that. I'm seeing it in. It's 54. It's going to be 63. I think we're going to top that. I think we're going to 65 to 70. I just just had that feeling because it's just a beautiful day. So, but what's going to happen today that you turn you come in there in a morning and this is the Simon and Garfunk old day. The sounds of silence. Uh, well, I'll call someone like here a concierge or something like that. You have that number? No. Probably give that to me. Oh, I don't have it. I got it somewhere. Yeah. Nice. The concierge is in my building. Yeah. I'll have someone go on and down on your door. You can pick it up on it with them too because they're like Latinos. Well, I'll try English. And if that doesn't work, then I'll work too. That'll work too. One thing about Toronto baby, air be buddy, speaking English. Even if it is not like right, they at least may do their best to do their duty. Nobody approaches you here in some kind of like swahe when you're some foreign language. I mean, I'll speak in English. I'm like Montreal, of course, where they got that frog craft going. I do like that casino there, Montreal. I just don't like the people. And the food, oh man, they got good food in that place. They got a great buffet up on top. It's like five stories Montreal. And then, of course, there's always falls view. And I go for falls. I think maybe next weekend, not this weekend, but the fun and one, maybe I'm going to take a little ventured out of Niagara Falls. And even though I'll lose my answer to you, you know what? I think I have a great time and they count the room and they count the meals and boy, you talk about good food. Mm. And good clientele. No. Ha ha ha ha. Man. What a difference in a clientele between woodbinder Niagara Falls. Of course, Niagara Falls, you know, is like a honeymoon place. Yes. I know that. So what's going to happen today, then I croak? Were you telling me about it? I will. I'll tell you all about it. I don't think that's going to be. I think I think this is my goal. I have several goals in life. Mm hmm. One of which I'm working on now. Yeah. And that is to. To live long enough so that my contract ends. You know, I keep extending extending it. I just like to live long enough. So I have it like at least one day of return. Maybe that's what your life spent will be based on. You know, as soon as you don't have a contract anymore, you don't croak. That's why the reasons I keep doing is because everybody tells me, oh, you don't want to retire because if we retired too young under the age of 100, you're going to croak you're with a rough and die. And, you know, I've heard that. I've heard that from people. Everybody says that when you have no more reason. No more reason to live. I have lots of reason to imagine you do, yeah. I know that. What? What are you talking about? Huh? Something. You are such a vascular man. Yeah, you're brutal. You are. Yeah. I think they had a point. I know. About you. Uh huh. So, it's $194. It's pretty excited about that. And he doesn't even know what that we're talking about. What are you? You'll talk behind my back. $195. We got $1100. What do you think? We got two hours to go. Should we go for 13? And you know, why not? And let me just tell you this. Brady Quinn would have looked real real pretty. And I'd dolphin the uniform. This is very, very quick. Whenever I shape up all, I listen to the heel Rogers 12 to one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. You're going to be a good one hour. Both of this I don't let those back touch. You're both true and surviving long. Tell a good letter, Ed各位, Ass 일�ιά. Toussaint, lead a slight page and do a better般 You love giving 보여cels kinder would you? We don't pay any credit, Ed各位, redass and leading likely men. I can't tell him to pushrenalink I know him to with all of ours He'll take it back So let me ask you, would you feel better today? Would you be in a better mood if you wanted to call a mine on Saturday? Oh, brother. It's a trouble three or five, 60. Speaking of golf stream and old far, it's golf stream part racing conceited, they viewed with a big opening day. It's Las Vegas style slot, my jeans, generating 334 grand and revenue. That was November 15, five months later. It's a different story right, John Burstine and this comes sentinel. The hell in the ill-meat race track, because you know how it's worth a April 16. It's daily total revenue falling towards lowest 56,924. My god, I could lose that much in one day if I was a crazy person. For the first week, the week's of April, the track average 131,800 in daily total revenue. Each machine generated about 100 eight bucks a day. Well, below the 250 knowledge for slots along these goes 100 eight bucks a day. From my sheen, but our expectations were pretty high from that standpoint. I don't think we met expectations. Also, I think it's a brand new market to build more fee. golf stream park president, hey, Bill, get with it, baby. Okay, get with the program. When I started to say before before you so weirdly interrupted me about croaking on the air or something. Yeah, was that people are creatures of habit. And when you're clientele for 20 30 years, at least, has been, you know, death plus a hundred, you're not going to get too many living and breathing people. Or even if you do bring back your fucking union gap. Gamling industry analysts have called the consumers performance disappointing, wondering about its ability to compete in the crowd, broward, and slots market. Of course you'd have them in day two, except for your fat ass former governor who went on the Spanish language radio station before the election. Oh, gambling all the, the model, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Whatever it was screaming the on. And all your people who love gambling, by the way, as you well know, they've used up right in the line. Oh, sure, whatever CCC senior you've flat ass idiot. And how's Terry Shavodne when by the way? How's there? You open. Gulf Stream Park, the county's first race track, as soon as was fighting the stick that claimed against three established seminal traplicacy, no isn't to other new casinos, Mardi Gras, race track and gaming center and the alicacy, alicacy, no racing and pop at a park. A seventh casino, Dania Highlise, gets to open late next year. That means potentially 10,000 slot machines ring within the county around tribal land. There's a lot of options for the entertainment dollar and software to Murphy said. Half of every slot stocked out of the race track, because he knows go to four desegications system. The major selling point for the state of our friend is a lot of hours per mutual to get the machines, which old gram on heel helped to get past and gets his slap in the ass for it. By the way, I got an email from Dufffield in the morning. Okay. I'm just telling you that he got the, he got sight of the melting pot again. All right. All right. That's a pretty food. Yeah, absolutely. More dipping and dunking. You know it. The legislature's office of economic and demographic research is projected to be side had a maximum 1500 machines. It would bring in 286 and a half million for education by the 2009, 2010 school year. And average of 71 and a half million for gambling site. That's based on each slot machine generating daily revenue, 262 bucks. I can take care of that in an hour, half an hour, 262 bucks my ass. Galsh Dean Park generated about $12.4 million for schools and it's first five months of corner state figures. The weekly contribution to education is dropped from a 713,600, the opening week to 400 and 2000, donor for the week of April 16, 2022. See, there's one thing this article doesn't want to take into account about South Florida. Okay. And you know what that is? What? That it's still a worsens buggy or that seasonal place. Now, what happened before April 16, Easter and Paceoff? Am I right about that? Mm-hmm. Nothing. And what happens in South Florida after Easter and Passover? Everybody goes right on the half ends. Nothing. The whole lot of nothing. Everybody goes. They pay a lot. When it does, they pay a lot of the time becomes like a ghost town. Am I right or my wrong? You're right. I'm absolutely correct sir. I don't really correct sir. This happened despite the track adding 700 or five machines last month, up against number of slots to 1221. Martin Graut, which opened 1147 in late December, about a month after Gulf stream park, has brought in about 16.3 million in for schools. Gulf stream officials can see there were missteps but say they'll soon see an increase in revenue. Among the factors that track officials industry and let's point to affecting the casino, Gulf stream didn't start a major at campaign for slots until this month. A law banning ATM machines in check cashing a track is hand-strong slots players and horsebedders. And it's just so stupid. It makes me want to sit here and scream. I want to just get up and just do the green apple quist tip all over my carpet here. The seminal hardwagon casino and hotel means the dominant force in South Florida's gambling market and Gulf stream park will soon face another obstacle part of its parking lot will become a construction zone. Construction said to begin next month on the first phase of the village of Gulf stream park, a 68 or complex of stores, condos hotel and movie theater, that means Gulf stream park will have to start offering a shuttle service for customers from the parking lot to the casino. At least maybe by then they might have an ATM. No ATM. I mean what is that? A casino with no ATM in here such a thing? No, never. I mean you go to the supermarket they have a free ATM so get more cash and buy more than that. The convenience store, the double-time shop. That is it. Everyone. The little Chinese market I go across right away with a lady who barely speak it in ways and she just loves me. I even got a little ATM in there. The third bread horse track, Gulf streamfares that people might think of the casino shut down with the racing season. It will be 22. Eric Lemmer and Gulf stream's wife president of gaming. It is not going to help with all that construction going on. People are going to drive by and think it is probably close for construction. And you know as one of the side, that perpetually every year when I was there for 400 years I was in South Florida, every year just before they go for the racing season to go. They start doing construction on US one right there for the track. Am I right? I am absolutely correct. Tara. That is a little highway. Oh, God. Like I said, there is the right way and then there is the Florida way. And as far as what kind of mood I mean guess what? I'm going to great mood anyway. Why? Why? I'm not a car. Oh, Halle, Lua. Halle, Lua. I'm going to come there for special occasions as you know. Despite being the first to help with Vegas style, Slots Gulf stream park officials acknowledge the track didn't capitalize whether they strong promotional campaign. A different management team of Gulf stream park headed by then president Paul McCoochi assumed that once this last move and people would simply show up Lemur and said, Koochi Koochi McCoochi, yeah, right. Yeah, open it and they will come just by our spouses. It's our kill way, I mean, you know, we got a new whatever show, you know. Everybody will just come flocking to five sixty. Won't they? Huh? Magnet or payment for a ghost in Paris per capita announcement, January that Murphy was replacing McCoochi Koochi, Koochi, who's going to hit various gaming initiatives for Magnet. Magnet and her payments corporate officials said last week that McCoochi is no longer with a company and could be reached for common. Remember, bugs he's single, I'll go ahead and have it in. Now that we've had to do, and now what we've had to do is pick up the ball run with it trying to make the best of a bad situation on Lorenzo. We basically have regrouped and started a whole entirely new marketing initiative to include all the things we should on the first place, such as direct mail, giveaways, promotions, different way to a TV advertising. Gulf stream park is founded about 50% of Slots plays its track to be into the casino once and never returned, he blames that on the lack of promotions and the legal band of ATMs and checkhashing at the three-per-mutuals with Slots. No checkhashing, no ATM just bring a barrel full of money, I guess. Once gamblers run out of money, a ghost named Park Thief to take a shuttle to nearby banks 18, where they leave. In this day and age, people won't carry the kind of money they used to carry 20 years ago because of the convenience of ATMs or in the racing world checkhashing. He said, I'm sure where the only major racetrack in the west that doesn't have an ATM machine or couldn't catch you with check. What kind of a bunch of communist graph is that? You silly old farts and so forth, huh? It's the typical thought away. Make sure it fails, okay? Your fan asked you, although wildly popular Jeff Bush, your fan asked Governor with his dysfunctional family and his two battalion of session. WQAM, hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. Where were you reading that article from about Gulf stream? Sun Sentinel. Sun Sentinel? Yes sir. How many cherries do you give a woodwife? One to five. Okay. One more thing. What about you know, man? I said I'm a scale of one to five and you leave one listen to the answer. Sir, sir. I said one to five. Oh. Meaning is I'm asking you, you mean on that scale? Yes. Minus ten. Okay. Listen to me. I got one sentence to wrap up this week in a sportsburg Miami. Yes. I'm high we cursed down here. All right. All right. Yeah, to which I would say yes. I think absolutely is what's easy. Well, I think wood lines are beautiful facility and it's said they got the 1700 slots and the food sucks, but you know, you got the escalator, the racing level and you can get the, you know, you, you, usual stuff you get the track, you know, pizza and they have a little cafeteria there and you got your macaroni and cheese and meat loaf and crap. No, it's a beautiful facility. It just, it depends on how you rated for what it looks like and how much money it's raising. Believe me, if anybody's making a lot of money, that's where they're making it and plenty of it is mine. Hey. Stench of cow manure. Puppers over this performance by the dolphins. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One drive in. I've got to fill my ass, you see. Time and time, I'll give you a hand. I heard a oil, supplies that will the flea eat when it's another war. We have to face. Now there's a hunger in the food escape. I know cheap food for him on say, hey, hey. Come on, it's no fair. Oh, what we got of crazy, come on, what is that fair? So as triple a day, can't they get any higher home? I just have no one to see. Can't they get any higher home? Go on drive, we'll find gold. Thank you Mr. President for those low gas prices and that's strong American dollar. It's worth about two cent everywhere else in the world. Nobody wants you in touch that baby and they a dollar either. Which in your case is make too much difference, but because you do all your business in dollars. Right. By like five dollars by half a loaf of bread. And maybe a cup of tea. Lemon 38 on a pool. What do you think Chris, we're going to make 13 or one? Oh, sir. Yeah. We got it. Well, what do we mean? We got it. We got 11.38. We're going to go for 13. We only got an hour and 41 minutes to go. And I thought I'm counting of course. Don't forget Wednesday. We got the Marlins game at 12.30. Pretty marlins. So we got to look up. They still find Chase Stadium wouldn't that be sad. I guess they do. Yes, they do. Oh, no. Why bother? I had Trent Green on here. You know, he's almost 37 years old. He'll be 37 before football season starts. Who? Trent Green, the aging quarterback of Kansas City, whom they're dolphin is allegedly trying to get to be their stock-gant quarterback because they don't want to have like a permanent quarterback for the future. They want to keep getting these old, uh, watched over, you know, at least he once was pretty good. At least he once looked pretty dang good. I'll say that. Okay, New York, New York weather. I just want to make sure it's not going to rain Wednesday. In New York. Okay. Wednesday, all sunny and 18 at 6465 sunny, not a cloud in the sky. Going to be beautiful for that Marlin Metz game. 12 30 pregame on Wednesday. And then I'm pretty sure it's the following week. Don't have an 11 30 exit. I think we from Thursday. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Here's the fact that says, I mean, not that we want to screw off and, you know, avoid entertaining new people for our four-solve hours every day. Walk solid. But if we can get out of it, we can get away with a one-hall-nine. When you agree, who's that online 12? Hello, Batline. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Dick Finder. I knew it was Dick Finder because I could tell about that squeaky voice. How are you doing, Dick? I'm good. You got me pretty hungry talking about down and about. Oh, boy. Here he is around around. Oh, no. Let's talk about Batline's and Buffalo Raceway, not. And also, how about David Vance and your pants? Yes, well, but, um, let me know, please. I kind of like, I like Dave's. I bought a horse from Dave Vance one. Oh, wow. Let's not talk about it on the ear. Dick, did you call the sabotage right? Sure, what? No, I, I, you've been talking about everything I'm interested in today. Yeah, I know. But I also want to mention that I'm not related to Joel Feinberg. You do a lot of work. No, I'm not. But I do. You think that would talk to you if I thought you were? And the thank you for your mention of Max Robinson, one of my personal favorites. Can I tell you a little story about that? Sure. Stand Baron. Now do you remember standing Baron? Three forms for it. Yeah, he was a sports guy from Buffalo. And he did this show called Racing from Buffalo Raceway and Racing from Batavia. Downs, depending where they were racing with that time. Sure. And I used to be at work to WBT and Batavia. And I was doing my show at night and we carried that show from 1030 to 1045. Fifteen minutes show. I was in good whenever I wasn't at the track. And so anyway, I used to run a board and then when standing on vacation a couple times he had me fill in for him and do the show. Well, the first night that I'm off there at the track. And you know, you're sitting there kind of like, I don't know, kind of like in the open. You know, and the acoustics are different from being like in a real studio. And so I'm, I'm talking. Well, listen, in the second round, I'm talking like five times as loud as I need to be. I have no idea why I was doing it. And Max Robinson, the track announcer was in the booth right next to me. And he gave me a look like just a piercing look that would kill. And I thought to myself, I thought maybe I better tone it down a little bit. And I did and sure enough, when the show was over he said, I asked more like it or something like that and whatever you know, he was a good guy. He was a good guy. You know, whenever I was like, he's or glasses around the house and I eventually find him. I'll just stop and go. And here they are. Oh, I love them all. At least you're not doing Roger Houston anyway. Hopefully. And I also, I found out a lot last week also that you went to camp Eagle Coast. Is that what it was called? Belly Cores or somewhere camp. If you were a Jewish kid from Rochester either went there or too many horses camp. I was in the air. I was the other one. I'll be one. Yeah, I had a, I was 16 years old. I went to summer camp the one year was great. Yeah, no, it's beautiful. The first couple days I was I missed being at home in the rest of the week. I never wanted to go home again. I went to the, I was actually at Eagle Coast for a couple of weeks. At the end of the summer on a special thing. It was, yeah, I love to let no forge that hilarious. So what are you doing these days, Dick? I'm just enjoying my retirement. You're, you're a forestry timer. Well, that's good. That's all right. It's, it's not a bad thing. The, I was like, you on Saturday. I just turned down the TV for five minutes and watched this Brady Quinting. I was just, I felt sorry for the kid. You know, I mean, they had it on TV. So, you know, what are you going to say after a while? Yeah. I mean, that's just, although I can remember a word draft decision. The, we went Buffalo, it all went the Buffalo Braves started me MBA. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I was in Buffalo, but I was up there. What they did, they had the first pick in the draft, and then they, you know, they had the first pick in the second round. They bypassed the greatest player in college basketball, who played in their auditorium where they were going to, and sold them abroad, auditorium for college gaming, Kelvin Murphy. They passed them up twice, and he became an MBA officer. Well, there you go. And now they're those, and they're going to lose the day they passed on Brady Quinting. Trust me when I say it. I mean, don't they want to put it in the subway? Don't they want to put bus in seat? Even if you're not saying it. Even if he doesn't work out, he's for a couple years, you're going to sell tickets. So, let me ask you this, the, the, the Derek, your call, our mutual friend Derek Per mutual friend. And said that Pomp and a witty has done a right in the place is beautiful, and, did they let you win there? I mean, if you, if you win in there? One last week, yeah, no, no. I mean, how is it involved in the planning of that, and they, they did the right thing. They, they integrated it with, with a racing one, say open the second floor. You'll walk right out onto a, into a little grandstand where you can watch the races. And, whereas, you know, I don't want to slam golf stream, golf stream. There's beautiful. You really have to be my guest. But you don't, you don't have a sense of fun or, I, I, they hear with a large crowd. When you go either to play the plot or go to the racing there, they've got all these different rooms, beautiful restaurants, and this path. But there's no sense of community, you know, like you're with a large crowd, you haven't found. I think that's the, you know, that's, that would be my, my wrapped, it golf stream. Well, one of these days when I'm back to I down there, I'll go over to Pomp and a one, I'll make my contribution here. No, we'll, yeah, we'll go on when they open the restaurants upstairs. You and I go, we'll go have dinner, one of the new ones. On them. On them, absolutely. Okay. Thanks a lot, Dick. Okay. I take care. Tell man, she says hi from the other side. 115, 5, I'm not so sure about that 1300. That's Dick Feinberg, formerly of Pomp and a Park, you know Dick, right? Yes, I think I heard it. Good guy, nice thing. Greetings, Neil says this, facts since you're gambling intensive this morning. Boy, we sure got in gambling intensive. FYI, Barney Fag, Barney Frank was on impure Friday talking about abilities in reducing the sense of legalized internet gambling. Probably has no chance of passing, but at least he be trying, says the facts. It'll Barney Fag, man. He's trying to do the right thing. I don't know about that internet gambling, you know? That could be awesome. See that, that's not for me. These people think I've got a gambling problem. Like the guy said, in owning Mahoney, I don't have a gambling problem. I have a losing problem. Yeah. Feel, feel of seeing more Hoffman. But the internet, boy, I said, you got to be really sick to start doing that. Really, really sick. Can you imagine how much you could play? I mean, there's no limit. I mean, talk about 24 or seven. Am I right? I don't know who you're doing business with. Exactly. Haven't we had a few internet examples of some lessons that we've heard ourselves? By the way, we have 1351 MySpace friends. You can tell me, girl, to put that in this pipe and you can smoke away. You're fair. You're going to be a boy. I guess you see KS. Right there, man, of the Nala fan. Check it all day to fill in. I'm the land to my house. He ran, now he's hiding in my basement. Or more. And you thought it was over. They got shot up in Iraq. Where the jokes on you, you pathetic boo. Was one of them came back. Pull the boo, oh my. He's here. Oh, I love. I tried to tell the reporter. But none of them wanted to hear. He's an evil dude with the bomb or two. And no one cares he's here. I'm on a ball. I'm on a ball. Woo, woo, oh my. Woo, woo, oh my. We're going to pull a ball. We ever get him or a summer. Yeah. Or any of those now. 1112.32 or 560. We got 1167. We need 133 votes by 2 o'clock to get to 13. Or Chris gets a trip to Chachau Square and we are. Uh, well, that'd be fun. No. A government commission that probably as we all summer were against, Hezbollah, Gerval is an usbianon, a huge prime minister, Aquad Olmert today of severe failure. Saying that he hastily led the country to the conflict with a lot of comprehensive plan. A close aid settlement with not resign, despite stride and calls for his resignation from coalition partners as well as opponents. A copy that we reported team by the AP said at a severe failure in lack of judgment, responsibility and caution. Well, that's unusual. How have we heard that before? Yeah. All more than for receiving the copy the panels findings said that failures will be remedied. The report is officially being released later today. All more than his defense minister, Amir Perrez, who took office with limited security experience less than two months before the war, already it lost much of their public support because of the conflict. Longest one has below the rose captured two soldiers and killed few others in crossboard arrayed on July 12. We're lying heavily on massive arrest, where strikes were recommended by the military chief Lieutenant General Dan Halutes. Olmert pledged to his people that his real work crushes Bala and forced return to the captured soldiers. Neither girl was accomplished and Halutes has already resigned to the did it. Cabinet Secretary Israel may mone. What kind of a name is that? When you're the Cabinet Secretary and the Israel and your name is Israel? Quantitists said the Prime Minister is not considering resignation. It is right to state as clearly as possible to report this to the people. The few of these failures and mistakes by all the leaders including the Prime Minister, may mone told us real radio. The question is what do we do now? Oh yeah, just like in Iraq, what do we do now? How do we do where do we go? What do we say? All of these are of these things. Five, six, seven, five tell you it was really great hearing from Dick Findberg, doing the Prime Minister. You know what's the lines where just smoking there before Dick Colton started talking about harness racing and that's the deal. And now it's like cheese. I don't want you to feel bad, Dick. I don't want you to feel bad to hear from me anytime, but it's just that they all go running. Just racing away and speaking of racing. Five, six, seven, five, sixty and pound five, sixty. I mean there are certain things in South Florida that just you can't sell make, you can't pedal, you can't give them away, you know? And that's one of them. Racing. They'd go race coming up Saturday, can tuck you there be any interest. No. Hall of Ha, any interest. So all the old Jews moved to Boca and then they died and then what happened? Well, speaking of that, don't forget mad dog at the broken sound too. In Boca. WQAM, hello. Hello. Yes sir. I want to talk to Neil please. Speaking please. Neil, we own here. Sounds like us, you know. I wanted to know what was, but he thought was a bigger claim to fame. He was a floppy second swan journey popping. Ranjermi by the way is now taking bit parts and grades the porn on movies. He's taking bit, thankfully not sexual ones. He weighs about 700 pounds. He makes outgoals seem to look like mini mouse at else fat as days. I just thought I mentioned it in piss. That's the room around town. Five, six, seven, five, sixty pound, five, sixty. I'd tell you one thing. Another one did the phone kind of, oh there we got a little chunk, 11, 74. So you better stop me from getting panicky. You know how I have a tendency to get panicky over the other side. That's right. Like, oh, you know me and I'm getting this age. I could have a stroke or like a massive heart attack here and Croaking the chair. What would you do then? Play a lot of music I reckon. You and that damn music. QAM, hello. Hey, don't you? Okay sir.

Um, you know as far as the end of playing the dollars down here, if you look at it, you have across almost pulling teams and you have now the gambling. Uh, you know, what, you know, what is there to do? What is that mean? What is there to do? What is that mean? What would you like to do? What would I like to do? Living soft for all that honest. No, no, no, no, no, no. Is that the question? What would I like to do? No, I'm not the soundiest. I'm the soundiest. What would you like to do? What I would like to do is Brady Quinn. 560560. That keep me busy all day Sunday man. And with any entertainment dollars, I got preferably for free though would be best. 560560. Pomp 560 with my entertainment dollars. Okay. Oh, God. I sure, I wouldn't go to any sporting events. I'll take that. Even though I get them free tickets. And you know, so readily in the enthusiasm that I give those babies away because I don't want to know from it. When I go to a Marlin game again. No. What I go to a dolphin game again, even if Brady Quinn were playing. No way Jose. See a bunch of drugs out there getting in the fist fights and the stands like making their stupid ass comments. See, you think we just get to stupid people around the phone on their show? I have to fight the news to you. Those people around the loose. They're out there. They're there. They're your neighbors. They're across the street. They're down the road. They're driving next to you on the highway right now on I 75 and 595 and I 95. That's right. They're there. They're afraid. That's right. But I go to any more Panther game. No. Talk about an organization that's going south that has made the playoffs since before Wayne Griskey was a baby. God. Old needle nose. WQAM. Hello. Holy jump in. WQAM. Hello. Josef. I'm glad you're here. How are you. Good. Good. We're going to get to Pona. That's a Brady Quinn. If you had a Brady Quinn and Tom Brady, right? They'll probably be an ex to Brady Quinn. Pat Quinn. Pat Quinn. There's going to be an ex to Brady Quinn. The mighty Quinn. Yeah. 560 or what was the amendment. 560 and pound 560 on the. For instance, regular wireless line. Yeah, the dolphins only wish they had Tom Brady. Okay. They would eat each one of them would eat 400 pounds of elephant droppings and crawl on on their hands and knees through the rest of it, 15 miles if they can get Tom Brady. But they won't, and they didn't, and that's it. That's the sad legacy, okay? And you can make all the smart comments you want, all the wise, Cratcho. The fact that a matter is that they just they never learned their lesson. And jaws were dropping. I wasn't only a sense of disbelief in seeing them say, Ted again. That was bad enough. But then in watching the reaction of all the so-called mavens, the experts, they were floored. They were speechless. They were like, ah, that would have, like that. Even George would make sounds like that. What? Come on. And I'm sure you were sitting there gloomy or TV. Gloomy, too. Which? Chew! I don't even know what it was, what happened. The only way I can watch it is because they kept chewing Brady quince, and they were in that, you know, with that very nasty looking blonde girlfriend. It looks like everything we all know that, but boy, she must have something that doesn't meet the eye, you know what I'm saying? Maybe he's got something that doesn't meet the eye. Maybe it is what we anticipate. Let me 178 votes on the poll. I really, I just can't believe it. But it goes to show you see, we're not part of the sports fraternity, and so as a result. We've attracted this audience of heave and non-sports, you know what I'm saying? How pissed off are you that the doll, and that's probably George's fault too. When you think so, Chris? Definitely. Because he's militant about it. How pissed off are you that all fans didn't drag Brady quince? Don't care for 130, 369 percent out of 1181. We need to get over 1,200 by the top of the hour, or we're going to be in big trouble for Chris's 1300, and his trip to Riyadh, all expenses paid. Don't care for 31, not surprise they suck, meaning that often organization, 345, they suck. I'm happy he blows 137. I agree with the, uh, should there choice 133? They like Ted Ginn, Jr. even with his bad foot and his unhealed injury. I'm psychotic 81, and ready to blow my brains out, 56. Isn't that our slogan here on QM? Ready to blow my brains out, Q56. That's it. I don't know, maybe 3. WQA and hello. QA and Ola. 10 deal. Yes sir. It's Brady. I heard you're looking for a good time. Ha ha ha ha. I'm Brady Schwartz. WQA and hello. Yeah I got a question for Neil. Speaking. Don't you think that Brad's hit is better looking than Quinn Brady? No. Where you out, you want to come? You know Tom Cruise. Yeah he's Mo, and you must be too. First of all, I don't think you're the one that I'm play football. Do you think that they play football, Brad, Pitter, Tom Cruise, I don't think so. Tom Cruise played football and had one awful movie. Was that losing it? No that wasn't the one. I would have won before. He played football and the movie. Yes he did. It wasn't losing it. It was either the one just before that or the one after him. Sorry. High school football. Come on you baby. And Tom Cruise is a hunchback by the way. Brad Pitter, all of these got. He's got craters in his piss. Brad Pitter. He's got crater pits. Then shy is finally out. He went too far. Then now it's hard. Thank God, so joy is history. Then shy is finally out. My ears would ring when he would sing. Now he's a little bit misery. I hate it when he would talk in ways. Then play a play fair for the boy. Tom Cruise threw into his truce. So shy is finally out. Pack his bags and his two bags. For fame, all is a father of God. Then shy is finally out. He went too far. Then now it's hard. Thank God, so joy is all for show. Then shy is finally out. His great ears would be boys. Give us no choice. We have the list to know. He's done like a word. If the friend out or look to schluck now. Then work his mind about seems true. Give him a bit fruit so stand and joy is finally out. Pack your gel and go to hell. Then come your very little house. Then shy is finally out. He went too far. Then now it's hard. Then got sent to his old final. Then shy is finally out. It was a flute. How he survived just plain bones. From all of the stiff and not the string share. Then David gets deep on. Then he's in resty-through. He's the resty-through. So say and shy is finally out. He's talentless. This is justice. Say and shy is finally out. There's show. I'm having a little witty here for lunch. Yeah. See all those bits that I've played about saying, giant, a lot of other shows. I'm leaving a hole in. These people are. You're a great one. All that you know, if not for those entertainment shows, I wouldn't either. You mean you wash those entertainment shows? I don't. Other people do. Uh-oh. Not in your household. In the house where I live, where my children play with their toys. There's an ongoing campaign to drive me nuts by putting Nancy Grace on the TV. I wish that those entertainment shows were the worst thing that I have to endure. How come we're stuck on 1192 here? Chris, we have 11 minutes for eight boats. We should be able to do that. Because once we get to dwell under, once you get to 12, then you get to 13. You know what I'm saying? Exactly. I don't know what I'm saying. W-W-A-N-Hello. I-A-A. Yeah. For real. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if you can turn in. You know what I meant. Okay. Huh? Or did I meet myself because I'm nervous? Because they're stupid.

WQAN, hello. QAN. WQAN. I think it's having nice day. Oh, I'm back to you. WQAN, hello. Hey, how are you doing? Okay. I'm talking to you. Speaking. This is a meal. Sir, let me ask you this. How much money you've got in your life? How much money do you have? Oh, it is not going to be all my money. I'm just a 10-say guy from the back of your head. Oh, God. Yeah. How are you doing Neil? It's just 29 years for you. 29 years of what? 29 years on the radio. 31. Oh, my gosh. My little stuff. And I got a question for you. I don't know if I should bring it up. But, you know, you know that same as senior Stevie Wonder? Yeah, it's going to be a bad taste. Don't bring it up. WQAN, hello. Hey, Neil, are you doing? Okay. This was I'ma, I'ma, playing about a job. WQAN, hello. Hey, Neil, you know, it's not taking quaint with D like to get the best going in the league. You got rid of them. Oh, we got it. Oh, now the pants is not the pants is. Oh, bye. I'm going to take care of my money. The pants are in a, see they can lig get away with it. In fact, I guess they can all get away with it because the so-called fans, there aren't any real sports fans in South Florida. I mean, maybe a handful, you know, a small handful. Maybe when they got the calipers out, maybe that's was a description for Brady Quinn, a small handful. Maybe just didn't measure up here. They got to be a, could be. Maybe when he was at that combine, you know, they did all the measurements and even measured it. Let's jump in doing the henshinies. Yeah, I should have pinched a little. Ha ha ha. Oh, man, how's sad? 231s. That's the reason they're not saying too much. You know, they're down on the dumps. We've done it again. We've done it again. They know. I might even sit around here listening to what, um, well, I'm just kind of curious. So what happened afterward on our air, you know what I mean? After they picked the mighty gin or, I'm not, I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to Chris. Okay. I'm not texting Chris. What were our people saying at that point? About what they meant to? How many past Quinn? Yeah. They were like surprised and shocked and then at he kept falling in the draft. They said, well, maybe there's something we'd dress with. Don't know about them. Yeah. The something was, and if you watched it on the ESPN, and they made it clear that the other teams didn't even go quarterback. They all had gotten it. Well, that's not true. Because it was about five of the teams I've passed on until he was finally a pick that could use a quarterback. You mean like Jacksonville, for example?

So, minute is resignation Friday. After confirming the way we see news, he had been a customer of a Washington DC escorted service. Oh my God. Who's older has been charged by federal prosecutors with running a prostitution operation on a prostitute. Tobias 65 director of US-48 assistants and administrative of the US agency for international development of previously service and ambassador for the president's emergency fund for AIDS relief. A state department press released late Friday afternoon sitting was only leaving for personal reasons. On Thursday, Tobias told ABC News. He had several times called the Pamela Martin and Associates Escort Service to have gals come over to the condo and give me a massage. Tobias, who is married, said there had been no sex and then recently he had been using another service with Central Americans to provide massages. I never had any massage from any Central American to you. No. Tobias's private cell number was among thousands of members listed in the telephone Americans provided way we see news by Jean Palfrey that will end up the DC madam who is facing federal charges. In the interview we broadcast next Friday on 2020, or is that Patee 20? Palfrey says she intends to call the bias and member of the Department of DC clients to testify at her trial. I'm sure it's not going to be going to federal prison for one day, little on four days because I'm shy about bringing in the deputy secretary of whatever she told ABC News. Palfrey maintained she ran a sexual fantasy business that was legal and if any of the women for her had sexed, they did so in violation of her rules and without her knowledge. She says there are a number of other prominent Washington DC men who will be on her witness list. I will bring every last one of them in a necessary, Palfrey said. As the Bush administration so-called AIDS ZAR, Tobias was criticized by some for emphasizing faithfulness and abstinence over condoms to present the a to prevent the spread of AIDS. In a 2004 interview, Tobias explained his approaches A and B and C. Ifston at works, the faithful works, condoms work, they all have a role he said, but it's not multiple choice, well, there's only one answer. As the top official overseeing globally, it's funding to other countries to bias was responsible for enforcing US policy and act of hearing the Bush administration that requires recipients to swear they oppose prostitution and sex trafficking. Now, I'm not their hypocrite. There's that word hypocrite again. I'd like that. Only in this case it happens to be a absolute correct answer. I'd like that. Prof. T. 7 on the poll we need 43 votes and 35 minutes man, it's going to be nipping talk down to the wire, just like Mississippi and Alabama. Just like in that house raised nipping talk.

Every business is closed down. Kids are out of school. And all these people coming from all over the country. They coming on the train and on the plane and all over the place. And it is so jam packed. Anybody who ever wants to go to Amsterdam. Don't go on April 30th. Make sure that's not one of the days you're going to be there. I mean, you know, if you want to be in the middle of a living people that's fine, but you can't even walk. You're only good part about that is you go out and you pretend you're like you're squirming through the crowd. You see somebody really interesting. Oh, excuse me. You like, you know, you're a little field. You know what I'm saying? What do you say? I'm saying if you're a perfect, you know how to do it. But it's just not a non-added day to be there.

You think what I, I ski or I water ski, do you think I do those things? No, but because there was other things that I would soon. Like, there's a, where it says, Shock, the shark exhibit, that is, I'm just assuming these are the shark exhibit. I mean, it's an underwear exhibit that I'm at. Like, uh, I mean, there's other things besides just the gambling. There's shows which terrific. Let me put it this way. There's great food here. There's all a gambling I could ever handle. It would buy in a Niagara Falls. It will falls you. I don't need to shut up all the way out there in the middle of the visit. I've been there a hundred times. I encrode it. I like it. But that's it. You know, everything runs its course. Okay. That's good. Okay. Good luck. What's wrong? You don't want to come to Vegas. Yeah. I don't want any part of it. Yeah.

And they're twice. I want to go back more off the. Well, yeah, twice. Okay. I'm sure that after I was there only twice, I said, oh, I say that all the time. I did go back a lot. And let me say it again. I'm not interested in the shark swimming underwater. I'm not interested in the buffet is to go and pick out which I don't need. And, uh, yeah. So they got two with Chris State Cowses there. That's what they got a good one here too. You know, I really like Vegas. What's that? What I'm in in Atlantic City. The Atlantic City blows.

It would buy him beautiful racetrack with a very nice racing Oman, 70, 100 machines and free food and free aggravation. And whatever you want, a lot of smelly people. Why do I need to go all the way to Vegas? I will say this because the MGM, which I love in Vegas, you go to the MGM. There's a living and breathing crowd in there. There's like, you know, people under the age of 100. Guys are always giving me this crap. All the old people play the slots. About Lonnie, man. Belloni, like that guy says. Belloni.

worried about the pull result is I'm about whether the dolphins reacted pretty quick okay because the honest goodness truth is even though I was shocked in a maze I couldn't give a fine lead party like that okay I'm on the scale of personal important things you know I mean though it was my personal priorities but the NFL draft and whom was drafted by the dolphins or not would rather I couldn't care less I didn't joy look at him sitting there for a long time and I also enjoyed the fact that he had that very marginal looking blonde girlfriend because I'm one of those pervert who believes that when you are an athlete you know a super-jock like Brady Quinn's been in college and you look like he does you can probably consult with whom ever you choose I imagine or my husband in Indiana I beg your pardon's been in Indiana you know there might not be that great you know looking girls up there in the Midwest yeah what are you talking about I've never been to the name Indiana so you know
