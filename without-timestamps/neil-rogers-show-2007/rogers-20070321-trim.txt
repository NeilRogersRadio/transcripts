Yeah, do or not is the case may be through the dust Do do do do do do do do I already done that? I already done do do do No, no, no, no, no Hello everyone this is Mari Poe, we chose to be current affair They don't come any better than Neil Rogers Several days ago I commented briefly on some recent statements that have been made by some members of Congress about Iraq And it's important to make this point at the outset The president of the United States purposely misled the American people on pre-war intelligence American soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq Go out every day and the most dangerous and unpredictable conditions These brave Americans were sent into battle for a delivered falsehood Pre-war information was distorted to corrupt the oil for food program There is no denying that the president lied to the American people This is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety It's also something I enjoy It's one of the reasons I've stayed in the business And I believe the feeling is probably the same for most of us in public life The president and his administration paid our country And heaped the liberties for which we stand They dwell on the shadows Have no regard for the laws of warfare and feel unconstrained By any standard of morality The president of the United States is dishonest and reprehensible And none of us should want it any other way Thank you very much Hi, well done Thank you, Dick Hi, I'm 17 at 5.60W to QM happy it wins They two here's our lineup today We got the mad dog at 2 to the power hour Hank in the mad dog together one of those very rare days Between 4 and 5 to 6 noon the power hour Everybody take a shower And then you got Hank Solo with the World Golf Championship Said to round 5 to 7 I love that one promo that we're playing where it's like They're describing golf on a radio that is really a simulating craft Hurricane hotline is 7 and any K-9 and midnight tonight Now what they since they blew out any K he's on more now than he was before And very often hours when people might actually be awake It's scary Speaking of scary right on the heels of that chaney But Doug Thompson writes Are you not going to read that, aren't you? Because you got to get to this pool and there's going to be a zillion Names that people want to put on the pool Let's get a zillion ziny Ziny colors today I got a lot of fun to pull Like those, yeah those are my favorite And him too, of course Doug Thompson says George W. Bush and the looming shadow of Richard N. Nixon With each passing day George W. Bush's actions were mostly mirror those of Another monumentally failed president, Richard N. Nixon, tricky dick Bush's performance to the night trying to wiggle out of the escalating controversy over the Politically motivated firings of eight US attorneys is just another example of Nixon we've worn And a corrupt president trapped by his own lies and malfeasance By refusing to let political guru Carl Roe and former White House council Harriet Myers testify under oath before Congress, Bush is forcing a show down that O'Cryplers' Albany Week in Presidency Yet Bush like Nixon remains arrogant until he end Determined to ignore the law, political necessity or common sense Given the lies on top of lies that the White House's told Congress over the past six years There's no way he's at the House or Senate will accept unsworn Off the record testimony for me the Roe of Ormires The Democratic leadership of Congress and a growing number of Republicans won Both on the record under oath where they can face perjury charges for the lies they will And inevitably tell And increasingly bipartisan anger toward the way the Bush administration Conducts his business surface like a title wave yesterday when a Senate voted 94 to 2 To revoke Bush's authority to replace US attorneys a growing number of Republicans no longer stand By their embattled and scandal written president and Bush like Nixon is finding himself Increasingly isolated from his own party and he merkin people The Bush that appeared before the cameras Tuesday night was not the swag wing W of old But one of the look of a cornered animal wounded but defiant As young reporter writing about a constitutional crisis in 1974 I saw the same look at Nixon's eyes and he scrambled for political cover Amid the growing watergate scandal Nixon like Bush did an accrumming political based treffy as many lies and boss attempts to cover up his misdeeds Nixon released transcripts of White House conversations calling an extraordinary cooperation with Congress And its problem of watergate Last night Bush used pretty much the same words to describe the White House release of emails And other records on the attorney firings History will forever define Nixon's failed presidency through watergate And his flagman attempt to subvert the constitution History will forever define Bush's failed presidency through the Iraq war debacle And as many attempts to subvert the constitution Both men violated their oath to uphold the constitution both failed a survey people both broke the law One residing disgrace The final chapter on the other remains unwritten But we can be sure that the chapter when closed will reveal another sorted period in American history right? Stug Thompson I still don't know what I'm talking about I hope they don't come and get you too soon They're probably trying to try to stand right now They got that IP address And I'd say maybe they got the GP RS They're like you know They're gonna shoot so at home They got their debat Just like that voice got For that voice got that we were treated to 455,000 hours of a cover John I think it's done Just wait for the ABC movie of the week I can't wait Here's the poll today And we already crisped about 832 on there Aren't you really proud of that?

And the guru, to rule on the England dynasty. Three Super Bowl rings. twice Super Bowl MVP. And a playoff resume. A kingdom of first class ticket to Canton, Ohio. However, his powers on the gridiron gives way only to his powers in the bedroom. For late in the 2006 season Tom Brady achieved the greatest back-to-back scoring feet in the modern era. First he impregnated Sultry Hollywood starlet. Bridget Moynihan. Then against all odds, this heroic field general, bedded and inseminated lingerie Supermuttal. Jiselle Bunchen. A friend. So, in honor of his triumphs between the hash marks and between the sheets. We bequeath the laurels and regal among the game's greatest scores. Number 12 Tom Brady. Nine.

Today's gaze. He says, dear straight people. Why do you hate gay people so much? Gays are hated, prove me wrong. Your top general does call us immoral. The range-in-relpeter-paced chairman of the joint chiefs is in charge of estimated 65,000 gain lesbian troops, some fighting for our country in Iraq. A right-wing political commentator and colbert gets away with calling a straight, presidential candidate to faggot. Even Dyrison Kearhal, people who's making really tacky jokes about gay parents in his column. This, I guess, doesn't qualify as hate, except that it's so distasteful and dumb. Often, a first step on the way to hate. Senators help me write him Clinton and Barack Obama try to duck the questions that paces big if he raised, confirming what gay people know. That there's not one candidate running for public office anywhere, who dares to come right on and equivocally and say, these and support a thing about us. Gays shouldn't vote for any of them. There's not a candidate or major public figure who would not sell gays down the river. We've seen this time after time, even from supposedly progressive politicians like Bill Clinton, with his don't-nastow-tell policy on gays in the military, and it's important that he is defensive mirror-jacked. Of course, it's possible that being shunned by gays will make politicians more popular, but at least we'll have our self-respect. To vote for them is to collude with them and their utter disdain for us. Don't know if you're wonder why heterosexuals treat gays so brutally year after year after year, as your people take away our manhood, our womanhood, our personhood? Why even as we die, you don't leave us alone. What can we leave our surviving lovers as taxed for more punitively than what you leave your legal surviving spouses? Why do you do this? My level will be unable to afford to live in the house we've made for each other over our lifetime together. This doesn't happen to you. Taxation without representation is what led to the revolutionary war. Gay people have paid all the taxes you have, but you have the quality and we don't. And there's no sign that this situation will change anytime soon. President Bush will leave a legacy of hate for us that will take many decades to cleanse. He has packed virtually every court and every civil service physician in line with people who don't like us. So even with the most tolerant of new presidents, gays will be unable to break free from this yoke of hate. Courts rule against gays with hateful regularity and of course the Supreme Court is not going to give us our quality. And in the end, so to speak, it's from the Supreme Court that such equality must come. If all of this isn't hate, I don't know what hate is. Our feeble game movement confines most of its demands to marriage, but political candidates are not talking about it. We're not demanding that they talk about equality. I love her and I don't want to get married just yet, but we want to be sure to be equal. You must know that gays get beaten up all the time all over the world, if someone beats you up because of who you are, your race of ethnic origin is considered a hate crime. But in most states, gays are not included in hate crime measures and Congresses refuse to include us in a federal act. Homosexuality is a punishable crime in the Zidin countries as is any activism on behalf of it. Punishable means prison. Punishable means death. The US government refused our request that a protest after gateeningages were hanged in Iran, but a protest many other foreign cruelities. Who cares if a faggot dies? Parts of the impriscible church in the US are joining with the Nigerian archbishop of the police, gay should be put in prison. Episcopadians, whoever thought we'd have to worry about Episcopadians. A hoover thought we'd have to worry about Florida. A young gay man was just killed in Florida because of his sexual orientation. I get reports of gays lying in our country every week. Few of them even make the news. Few are prosecuted. You consider it acceptable that 20,000 Christian youths make an annual pilgrimage to San Francisco to pray for gay souls. This is not free speech. This is another version of hate. It's all one world of gay hate and it always was. Gays know realized that the more we become visible, the more we come out of the closet, the more we're hated. Don't those of you straight who claim not to hate us have a responsibility to announce the hate? Lies that socially acceptable to joke about girly men or discriminate against us legally with constitutional amendments banning gay marriage. Because we cannot marry, we can pass on only a fraction of our states. We don't have equal part-out parenting rights, and we can't live with a foreigner. We love who doesn't have government permission to stay in this country. These are the equal protections that the Bill of Rights profane for all of us. Why do you hate us so much that you want from it as to legally love? I'm almost 72 and I've been hated all my life, and I don't see much change coming. I think your hate is evil. What do we do to you that's so awful? Why do you feel compelled to come after us with such frightful energy? Do this how how make you feel safer and legitimate? What possible harm comes to you if we marry or are taxed just like you or are protected from assault by laws that say it's morally wrong to assault people out of hatred? The reasons always out for our religious ones, but certainly they're not based on the love all religions proclaim. Any even if your objection to gaze our religious, why do you have to legislate them so hatefully? Make no mistake for making gay people of love or marry is based on hate pure and simple. You may say you don't hate us, but the people you vote for do so what's the difference? Our own company's democratic process, it tears us to be unequal, which means in the democracy that our enemy is you. You treat us like crumbs, you hate us, and sadly we let you do it. I don't hate you, go Larry. You're fair, Larry. What? I don't hate you, man. Well, there you go too bad. Yes you do. So I don't. Let me ask you, well, let me ask you one thing about it. You like it, say. I like my hate on a full day like our poll today. Although they don't. I don't just shot. I mean this poll is so wide open. You thought there'd be as many people that they would want to put on here. You know? As opposed to the stupid thing last Friday, well, of all day stupid expressions. You know what? That was pretty good polls, all right. I mean there's a lot of stupid expressions, and there's a lot of stupid people. And a lot, you know. 9. 22 on that poll. None for George Rodriguez yet. And Paul Owens got to be. He's got one. What? Nobody wants to be you. No question. No kidding. Trust. I think even you probably just going to say that. A Brady Quinn, your buddy, where she says, put Brady Quinn's got more girls than Jerry's got curls. I have no idea what that means. Do you have any idea what that means? No. Brady Quinn put him on a poll right away. Well, there's one. 560560. I already said I wanted to be Brady Quinn. Even so I could just do, kind of have a good time with like myself. WQ, 2 AM, hello. Hey, Neil. How about the ladies and maybe a few of the men out there too. Okay. Vanessa, how are these? Okay. He gets to have done that. So I did that. I knew exactly where you were going. Yeah. You knew where I was going with that in you. So I can recognize. He's probably is a month on, but he gets to have her. Hmm. See that. That's what. I like that. Okay. I'll write. I just wanted for a day. It's a day with him. Okay. I wouldn't leave the house. I had a couple hours with him back on Z to bed day, but I just, you know. And this my chance. Just like Salotso said in the Godfather. I missed my chance. I'm the 101. Remember that? Resur you do. Salotso. I am the 100. Don't start with that Godfather stuff again. WQA and hello. Neil. Yes sir. I have a first one I'm coming about to do. Right. The center is founded on double standard. Splay voters wanted to be free. Yeah. Second I'm going to pull for you for the future. Best year ever for music and music and what? Lovies. Like what movie and what music was out in that year? That's great. Okay. Well, talk about it. Let's also have an 1801 and we'll move on up from there. What do you think? 560-70560. How about this pull today? I don't think this is a bad pull. If I could be somebody else for one day, I would be blank. I mean, you think there's being big choices on there. You know, like, poopy compo. They'd get away. Jean Rayburn. Things like that. You know, Paul Lind. John Stockwell. Welcome to QAM. Hello. Good morning Neil. Good morning sir. Yeah. This is the guy that called a couple days ago with the Luca Brassie. I question. I've, you know, sleep with the features. I had just something else you guys want. I want to check one. I know. I was right. I was a company where I just thought I mentioned it again. You know, I'm going to talk about it. I don't know if I'm going to go out. What is it? The, the only thing maybe, George didn't look at the script. Well, I'm going to wrap the same. If I'm going to talk to him from Miami, I'd have tried to talk to the speaking with Michael Wagening. Rafa to his wife got played there and the casino with the bingo. And she took his hand. And she said hello Mr. Paul. What the heck is that? Mr. Paul? That's what she called him. She called him Mr. Paul when he said hello to him. And they did last kill the next time. What is this? You know. Okay. Well, we'll find out. Nobody's talking about. No, I don't know. Should have, should have quoted the first one was good. Oh, now let's see. Oh, look at this. Bob Norman has no update information on Joe Rose on his blood. Bob Norman, you're a jackass. Okay. And idiot. A jackass. It says Joe Rose has been caught in the principles office. Now who's this two and from and whatever? To email to me from someone who saw that on Bob Norman's broad blogging. Joe Rose has been caught in the principles office in B. C. Six. We explained what he said in the year last week about the Deserability of black women whom he distinguished his red bones and Chocolates or his Ray Nagan would say chocolates. It's going to be a chocolate. No, Aliens. Ray Nagan. Nothing. He's reading today with station. He said this was yesterday. Station. Second is about the comments to me last Wednesday on his video show on seven night of the ticket. According to Broward Times reporter, Elgin Jones, who's dogging in this case. He's dogging it. He's bird dogging it. Jones just now interviewed Larry McDaniel and B. C. C. C. Five President programming. He told him the station is looking at the matter. That Rose was coming to the office to explain what he meant. When he said on the area for for his red bones, our lights can black women at chocolates. And they understand most black men feel the same way. I left the message with McDaniel to confirm it, but I've heard back from him. But we don't even know who this is. Is this of this is Bob Norman's stuff. While NBC six is looking at the matter, the tickets hiding under the bleachers on his story. It hasn't returned numerous phone calls emails from Jones asking for comment. Which reporter feeling a left him a bit blistered. When Tim Hardaway made his comments about hitting gay people on this day, they blasted it everywhere. He said, but in this case, in an over return or phone call, probably because it's much to do about nothing, Bob Norman. Rumors are still probably that some of Rose's co-workers are upset about the comments. His boss has Jones happens to be a black woman. So he really stepped into it. And it will bucket of stuff. But should the former tenant be canned by NBC and where the dolphins be for race. So idiotic? No, that would be wrong. For one thing is audience other than attorney Jack Thompson apparently wasn't offended by it, which is always the case. Rose must not be real big in the black women demographic. But he should definitely be made to apologize publicly for being such an insensitive bonehead says, Bob Norman, hey Bob, you ought to apologize for being a bonehead, make an A-mountain out of a whole hill. You idiot. Pack a standing police in Karachi or hunting a man who dug up his father's two-year-old corpse and took it home in a hijacked ambulance to try to bring him back to life. All right. Oh, rock. Can't hurt. Abdul Rahman's family says he's mentally ill. Never been able to cope with his father's death. He dug up the corruptsters in NF feed hijacked an ambulance and its driver at gunpoint and took it to his home. Please rate the house on Friday after complaint from the trust that only ambulance and were her mramin's brother. I thought those were noodles ramen. Yeah. Remember noodles? He kept the corpse, which is nothing but a skeleton in his bedroom for a well over 12 hours. He escaped when we rated the house and we have buried it again. They said, rockman also kidnapped a vagabond, has loved in the graveyard, and locked him up at home too. Well, maybe he's lonely. He told authorities he saw raffle and chanting music spells and pouring rose water on the corpse to bring it back to life on his crying bitterly. But we'll have to talk to him tonight. Come back for another round of no right. I'll be back to you. I'll be back to you. All the gifts he saw in the candy. But he'll probably make 60. No laundry, shall. What? This is your point. What? What? What? Any questions? The door is real. No. The alarm is now explained. It's time to change the station. Turn it off and turn it on your right-hand. Absolutely. Some stupid portal slots don't care about their jobs. A healing of the audience of ratings, rather than I want to face, small back to break the meat, that's when your face falls. Right here you're home, most sportsmen, it's a few games that it's sort of a way of how you live, these endless new things, make your face fall. Shut up, I'm up, you're ass. Rectrums. They don't care if they just get, they program for the shivers with their nose and meditate the injunction drafts. They kiss each other's eyes. Well, howling sport-ho guys, it's murdering the audience for holding what they like if on the face falls. The rate thing all are not for part of the face falls. They can't get any dumbers. The management here don't give a crap what you think. They're busy, spinning, bow, and athletes, keep you very small. With all the sportscrafts, you'll see a baby small. Right here, not so strong, I asked, good news though, we have no ballgame today. That's a good story. Yeah, It's a good story. It's a good story. 12 of you more, another story, it's a good story. Man, it's only kind, it's a good story. I'm almost tempted to play. Hello, to the bar. This is Danny from the steamer. Can I just speak to the red? Red? Yes. Red? Oh, oh, oh, oh, Danny from the steamer. And like, I like to know if there's a house or like a kick. Is it a place? So, I want to know. How to like a kick? Who is this? This is Danny. The steamer bar? Yes, that's out. But, uh, it's life called here, and there's nothing. People hear something that he wants up the... So, Yeah, this is how to like a kick. I don't understand what you say. It's just like a kick. I like it. Do you like my place? I just post it as to how to like a kick. I do like it. Is that about his name, your life again? Oh. I don't like a kick. Hahaha. Anybody's name, your life again? And not nobody about that name. Is that true? No. I'm out. Okay, nine fifty five in a poll. How about the mic? Is he there? What would you want to get in that? Two deeply. No. Five, six, seven, five, sixty. At least I don't. And pound five, sixty, and he Verizon, and singular wireless line. Really said, remember, I'm just literally disappointed. I thought we had turned the corner. We started on Monday, and then yesterday we made a big... I thought yesterday was just defined as wine, you know? I would even say... Nice. Yeah, I would go head far. But, now today they're back like we've always said, man, don't ever assume this audience can keep it going, you know? WDQAM Hello. And you know that Virginia City in Nevada, where you wrote this book by the earlier story? Yeah. That's actually the opening scene of Bonanza with the ponderosa. You know that burning map? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a... Yeah. So that enclosing, Kappa Foko, Tom Gunson, much fuck up baby. WDQAM Hello. WDQAM Hello. WDQAM Hello. WDQAM Hello.

That's a lovely of what they got. So I guess the pull is all... complete. Really? It just... That was my mind. There were times when I think there was no way that they're going to be adding on it. You know, we got everything that could possibly be on one. And then all of a sudden, I got one kind of pull. And now today, when I thought that the originalist was really, really weak, you know, very weak. Extremely weak. Maybe the pull question is very weak. I think it's just fine, you know? I would say... Nice. 951. I'm 61 and a pull. So make 1000 easy to sell or but nevertheless. Maybe the Vizzi voting on it. WDQAM Hello. Can you play that bit where the guy goes to get away from my car? Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you this question. Do you know who this is? Yeah. Yeah. Do you know that we're going to... That's something that's just get away from my office. Yeah, do you...

Hey, how about Ron Terry? Oh my god, you want to be double-joyed. For days of matter of fact, oh wait a minute. Give me a moment. Because I proved they, somebody posted the comment on my space page that talking about Ron Jeremy. This is even more athletic, athletic than Ron Jeremy. Not nearly as sexual, but let me just look on a page there and see if it's up there. Oh yeah, there it is. Wow. Give me a moment that expression about having your head up your ass. I have in my life. I have never seen anything like that. Thanks Eric, by the way, whoever Eric is. Are you looking at it? I'm going to go well right now. Go to the Marlin Brando main page there. Not too far for where the week's Miguel has that ugly look on his face. Like what was that big thing in the middle of Mariah Carey's chest is what he's wondering. And right there on a very first post. Are you looking at it? He said, come back to me in an hour. I might have it up by then. Oh come on. How about you Chris, can you see it? Yeah, I've seen it before. That's just scary. It is scary, but it's, is it for real? Oh no, it's not. Well, what do you know? No, it's not. How do you know it's not for real? Um, maybe it's a head could fit in that orifice. Maybe it's got a fin head. It's not for real. And look at that. See that before. Abby, but that may not be for real, but it sure is cute. Sure, I'll give you a second. Yes, it runs your meat with put on. They're wide but anybody want to be that fat in that hairy. What's the point? Because you got to leave a lot, some big deal. Wow, how about being somebody who looks good and gets a lot of action. How? As opposed to somebody discussing, it has to get paid to be the old geez. Ryan Jeremy. I sat right across the table from where you're sitting right now. I just, I thought to myself, you people actually are paying money to watch you do anything. I've paid money to watch him disappear. 1966 on the pole though, keep your eye on that. W2AM, hello. Yes. Money. Money. You know that I really miss the one that I really miss. You're the quintense. You haven't played up for so long. Rich, you're playing the quintense? Yeah. What is that? That's, uh, one of the few is the play one they would have run. Err, she was, what? W2AM, hello. Anyhow, how you doing? Okay, sir. Uh, some pretty poor. I would have liked to have been, uh, old geez since then, looked over the day committed those murders with a camera. And there's only one problem with that. And that is if I could be somebody else for one day, I would be not who would you want to have been like 80 million years ago when OJ murdered those two people in cold blood. But you continue like you always say, they make the question into what they want to do. They answer the question they want to answer. Whatever question that, uh, no, first they come up with an answer. They create the question for, right? Kind of like on that stupid show of jeopardy that you like so much. Uh-huh. They had some of the dumbest people on the real fortune. And last couple of nights that I've ever seen in my life. You mean, double the usual? Dumber than usual. They had one guy in there and I think he had like about 10 grand on the line too. And it was chocolate covered macadamia, something. Whatever one. Well, whatever one. And he said chocolate covered macadamian. Whatever one. Uh-huh. And on the end of it, there was no more letters. There were no more letters. And they had one on last night. She was even almost as dumb as he was, but there didn't love them, people author. And apparently mostly from Florida I would think. Here's the story of a football family that you'll get when you knew I'm a lot of girls. You can give your lady dolls, or some diamonds, but don't release your girl. Here's the story of that Tom Brady who was busy giving every girl upon. And monofames and he'll be a father, but she was not all alone. And came one day when Tom Brady was a devil. And he knew too many times that he'd been touched. Now he's just months away from a football family. In pregnant women they wrote a Brady joke. A Brady joke. Tom Brady's mom. She got a baby and almost up by Brady's mom. Nice. 11.16 at 5.60. WM975, also in a full make of 1,000 by. I'm thinking maybe the bottom of the yard, or surely thereafter. Any interest? No. Anybody here? WQA and hello. Yeah, Neil. Yeah? How you doing, buddy? Good. You know everyone's at a while. You fire up that song, short-path bandy. Yeah. Very well.

Actual records. This one, let you know. Okay. Good luck to you, pal. How you like that? That was marginally interesting. That was the first record that he ever bought. He's a little keen. So that made a way games that have a short-path bandy bandy bandy bandy. That's like having a short-path bandy bandy. Tell our journey to Zeeville. And we've got a fast bandy, but it's short.

A girl's beloved dog in a Grizzly Nightmare written by Mary Lynn Smith and the Minneapolis Saint Paul Star Tribune is a very sad story. Crystal Brown's world was turned upside down a month ago when sheavy, her four-year-old Australian shepherd makes didn't come home. What kind of a name is Effort dog anyway? Sheavy. People in the dogs are all kind of stuff. pretty stupid name. I told everything and he never shared any of my secrets at Crystal 17 who had some troubled times in a young life, Chevy was her therapy dog and she leaned on him for comfort and support. This is a very sad story. Two weeks ago a gift ramp box was left at the house where she lives with her grandmother in St. Paul's right street area inside the box, Crystal was horrified to find her dog's head. This was so cruel, Crystal said this is one sick twisted person. The incidents considered so shocking that the United States announced its offering a reward of up to 25 of us for information that you have to address in conviction. Homicide investigators are looking at the case because of the implied terrorist threat. Same policy starts in June, Gray said, a terrorist threat. I didn't realize that be hitting a dog was a, I guess everything could be terrorism, couldn't. Yeah, you're scared to hell at any right now. This was extraordinarily heinous said the al-Barleti, you mean society's therapy manager for animal cruelty issues, ideal with hundreds and hundreds of cruelty cases each year when I read about this case, it took my breath away. It's horrible, he said. This case Bartlett said as far worse than a recent episode in Oshkoshu's cousin, where a 49 year old man decantitated to his kittens because they were annoying. Samely the dogs said that the teenager was a malicious act Bartlett said that level of the private is beyond belief. Shirley Brown, Crystal's grandma said that Chevy wanted off after she showed him out one night mid-Fabory. Crystal pecked at the neighborhood with missing posters and went door to door with two photos of Chevy and hoped that somebody had spotted him. She wrote the bus countless times that he'd seen Paul Animal Shelter and called her thousands of times she said, I felt empty, Crystal said I couldn't talk to anyone who was my dog. It was just me and him and a dog named Boo. Well, who did that? Go tell me. Very ugly guy too, by the way. Because when we get it, yeah, that's right. What is it? No, no, no, here's a hint. It's a kind of dog sort of. Who is sort of? It's a kind of nine. I don't know. Lobo. Oh. Libya? Excuse me. Then Shirley Brown came home one day and thought a boss wrapped in red paper on her front steps with batteries taped to the box. Congratulations, Crystal, no, said this side out batteries included. And it's sick. Shirley Brown placed a box on her granddaughters bedroom dress. Her I was surprised and excited Crystal said, I thought it was a gift for my cousin. She tore off the paper and ripped up on the box inside. She found Valentine candy and a black garbage bag and then she saw her dog's face. Crystal screamed around the kitchen to find grandma. Is this my dog grandma? No, that's not my dog. Is it my dog? Mm-hmm. Grace said, Investigate is really the case. It's an isolated incident and the suspect knows the family. We don't know what the motive would be. Grace said it's a terrible thing to do to somebody's pet. Anybody with information regarding the case out loud, we're not going to give up phone numbers for the same thought police. Chevy Crystal said was the best friend she ever had. He was more patient than any person I ever met. That dog waited for years for me to get myself together so Crystal would then of course begin to cry and get shrine who can blame her. That dog didn't care what I did, what I didn't do, what anyone did to me. He didn't care about anything. Just wanted to love me the way I loved him. Crystal's got a new puppy now. Another Australian shepherd that she named diesel. The puppy's no Chevy, not yet anyway. Hopefully he'll be my best friend. Crystal said hopefully he'll be my guide through life. Crystal and diesel. Let's hope. Now let me ask you if Crystal turns out to be a lesbian. But that may fizzily diesel. Oh, don't even go there. Okay, well, I won't go there. 90 in the pool by the abondment they all have a thousand. There's Bob Bowen at stupid mustache. What a silly person man. Bind Mr. Bush himself. Had to beat but it would bit about. 991 on the pole now. 560, 50560 pound, 5060 in the horizon, singular wireless line. WQA in hello. How are you doing there? Okay, sir. I would like to kill a comment for Christ today. Okay. We'll go ahead. Why don't you get a couple of them? Kill a calming for Christ. Kill somebody for Jesus, man. The more religious you are, let me tell you right now. This is the true test. The true test of how religious you really are is whether we can really get you to go out there in in radio land. I'll find it and just kill so people. That's right. And the more you kill, more religious you must be. Because that's what religion is do better than anything else. Kill some people. WQA in hello. Hey, buddy. Yes, sir. Has anybody called him with where he came in? No, and they won't. I just did. Get out of here. You go to the store and put dice. You like him. Snacky, suspenders.

Filthy perversion It is? Oh good Line back for the neds Mudpack for the sack pleasures Haven't they pledged you to have a me pleasure I line back for the neds and a mudpack for the sack Okay, I kind of a ring to it, doesn't it? It does Your pants have an inventive sex industry This innovation is an adept of the facial A mudpack for the penis According to spa, whatever publication that is, spa Authorities have a recent years taking a harder line on the flesh trade Another little play on words, a very clever herber This is on the MSNBC website, by the way So you think that it would be much less suggestive And much less growth-task when which case we wouldn't care Authorities have a recent years taking a harder line on the flesh trade Prompting operators to come up with an increasing new variety Of services aimed at providing pleasure But circumvading the long arm of the law arm of the law. But how can you have any pleasure if you don't have a long arm? Right. The mudpacks for the penis which follows a line back to the gonaids is part of an Italian style aesthetic treatment offer by a Tokyo Bay service called the Aero Monning. Sounds like, don't sound Japanese to me, it sounds Italian, huh? Edamani, sounds so schmaltsy. A whole lot of operations similar to the wire spring up in a short time we need to provide a service. Nobody else was offering in. This was it. The Adomani boss tells spa. Our sales point is that we also offer variations including having the service performed by multiple workers, groups of two or three women, or you can have it performed by a shy woman or another one who will be talking dirty while she's doing it. I want this shy one. The Aero Monning, I want a shy woman who's talking dirty. The Aero Monning's boss is the service began with a motto of providing health and beauty to the Willie and Amis. Yeah, that sounds real Japanese, there's one. Willie and Amis. I knew that guy, what's the height of the Aero Monning? The service involves using a hotel sink or face washing basin and filling it with warm water and wine. Try the wine. This is ended in proving the circulation. Instead of inserting the face in there, however the client places their bottom in the bowl, allowing the penis and Amis to be stuck in the suburb of their SEMO-YAY. I can just put my face in. First is Samadhyad, I don't even want to know. Oh, come on. Sounds French. No kidding. Not Japanese. Spine notes that the washing is performed by at least one woman who the Aero Monning and SIS must be in her 20s or 30s at the oldest. Once the basic basin finished as finished, the genitals are swath in a chunk of mud supposedly to cleanse the skin. Once they're completely covered, the woman or women providing the service, then they show their handy work. So to speak. Oh, wait a minute, I can't read this. I'll read it. Until the client reaches climax or what spa calls the Ascent to Heaven. Yeah. Well, that sounds very sexual to me is what it sounds like. Hmm. Sounds like some kind of a whole house to me is what it sounds like. I thought there was something really, you know, what different can it happen? It's just a different way of achieving the same old means. So you know, sitting in the sink is something to think. Sitting in the sink and why would I think? Boy. Oh, that's a 40s, six votes on a pull by the way. Those Japanese man, they were all those orientals man. They are so, uh, warning bizarre. Oh, warning.

And let me tell you if you think she's hot lately, you should have seen her in high school. Smoking hot. It would have turned you straight. He says, if I wasn't such a loser in high school, I would have gone for this correspondence. But I was wondering if you ever see her again, tell her to add me on her in my space. And if she doesn't have a my space, tell her to grow up and get with the program. It said that I can still remember her from history class and 20 plus years ago. Oh, well, who the hell doesn't remember? And believe me, I was in high school 47 years ago. Four or 44 years ago. I'm like, I'm like, I'm like a 75 by now. Great to wait in 1960.

And then she's, I like a sarcotic bitch, huh? I'll play the voice now. They're on the radio over there. Yeah, on the radio over here. We're on the radio over here, and you're not. Honey, neither was Dons sure would. I'd rather put Robert assure would on, especially for you. I'd like to check in that camera, was that? That was your theme song, Robert assure would. She had a 15 minute show. She tinkled on the panel. I'd like to show a lot of people who would like to see a show these days with some, you know, some celebrity who would tinkled on the panel. But anyway, no thanks. That's not my bad. Especially for you. That's well, I'm here for. And Dons sure would put him on here. Are you crazy person or one, honey? Are you crazy? Jesus, God and Joseph. No wonder people turned to religion with crap like that going around. Like some kind of a disease. Like a disease in your radio. We got a disease in our transmitter. It's freaking Dons sure would disease. We would cope before we put Dons sure would on here. How do you like that, honey? And so, what everybody else, which is why he couldn't buy his land of the year. If he had a million dollars a minute, he couldn't buy his way on the air. Whoever the hell he is. I've got your breath beautiful. Several days ago, I commented briefly on some recent statements that have been made by some members of Congress about Iraq. And it's important to make this point at the outset. The president of the United States purposely misled the American people on pre-war intelligence. American soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq go out every day into some of the most dangerous and unpredictable conditions. These brave Americans were sent into battle for a deliberate falset. Pre-war information was distorted to corrupt the oil for food program. There is no denying that the president lied to the American people. This is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety. It's also something I enjoy. It's one of the reasons I stayed in the business. And I believe the feeling is probably the same for most of us in public life. The president and his administration paid our country and paid the liberties for which we stand. They dwell in the shadows, have no regard for the laws of warfare and feel unconstrained by any standard of morality. The president of the United States is dishonest and comprehensible. None of us should want it any other way. Thank you very much. Some of you can see the occured belief in the government and justice itself. What we stand up to stand on this young fuzzy? Whatever we stand. Right. So what was that deal of we had just before the autopsy. There was something about anybody who wanted to consort with Henry Burrow's daughter and they said, Sure would. Sure would. There was saying that. I must have been it. Yeah. Because nobody would in the right mind would call say, Hey put on. Sure would all the air kneel. It's really talk about the impediment of desperation. That you have to have like a pin, a female pin, who calls this show. And she called before because I forget all this. She's called Clarence. She's called the voice mail. I saved the voice mail because they're ridiculous and insane and comical. Pretending to be a producer and it's got to be as wife for his daughter or something like that. Because he's in the background. You hear him in the background. Coaching. Coaching. He's yelling at each other and all this stuff. The man's like a hundred from the sound of him. Yeah. He's talking about the age of just the face of me. You're going to get that guy from my window. He's just named the guy from Boston. Don't you remember that old fart from Boston? Oh, I thought you were talking about from the black group. That was Larry Justice. Justice. That's right. For justice. He couldn't face the fact that they can't even got him off the air because of the fact that he's stuck on the air. Not that he was a hundred years old. Nobody cared about that. If he was a hundred and could have gotten an audience, they'd have kissed his fat ass. But they didn't. WQAM. Hello. You're talking about the boy. Yeah. We're talking about how bad you are is what we're talking about. You're very, very interm... Your pathetic is what you are. I read the list of the DOM. Sure would. Listen to you. Okay. Reverend Schmackle. Five sit. Well, they just can't do it today at all, man. I mean, once every hour and in like every half an hour, every forty-five minutes, all of a sudden we'll be like a little a little a little spurt if I can say that. And then that's about it. Five six, seven, five, sixty pound five, sixty in the Verizon singular wireless line. This is always short. QA. Like I said, it's always short. That's it. Okay. Back to my pile. See, this was an interesting experiment. I tried it for like two and a half days and it seemed to be working like a charm. Didn't it seem to be fine as wine? Yeah, for a while there. But they can't do it. They haven't got it in them. WQA in, hello. WQA in, hello. Can George teach us how to play Domino's? WQA in, hello. And they'll definitely will love to be both of them while I'm talking to me. Huh? Roger, perfect. Please. Bobford track is in Harvey Wasserman, right? Blowback from Ohio's 2004 stolen election is escalating. Blowback from Ohio's 2004 stolen election is escalating. Blowback. This is a long story. Am I going to have to have to read this?

And log in using your funnet account. WQAM. WQAM. She's at least better than to don't sure what lady QAM hello. Hi. I want to talk to Neil. Speaking. Neil, you still feel for a bad dog, Charlotte.

Do you know who Don sure with is? I remember him vaguely. And it will just like justice. It's better that I kind of put the both out of my mind. You know. Let's make live. Let's put this way. It may stand major. It looks like it's dying in the industry. You know what I mean? Who is this? No, no, no. I'm going to long time. Listen. That's all. I'm just a radio person. Not an officer. Just a loyal. If they're who calls and because of your took a service. So often, they do stay on the air. Right. Correct. Um. I even hear. Did you have any comment on that Hillary Clinton video that they did? The old Apple commercial. Did you see that? Yeah. I've seen it a hundred times. And this is the new campaigning in the age of the internet. This is the new deal. Well, it takes the spin match. It takes the spin match through that again. Because whatever cock-o they can try to put out on us. We can, you know, someone else can go back with something. Right. Anyway, listen, you're the best there is.

Or else we're going to have impeachment problems. And, put it on the past track before I have another hard attack. Prop 32, 28 to 1 and 5, 60 WQM. So, like I said, I thought we really turned it a little bit of a corner there. And now all of a sudden I realize I'm staring off into space realizing, but I'm not even though I'm diluting myself. Bob Fitzrec is in Harvey Wasserman, right. In a bull road to restore treacherous elections in Ohio, Ohio is newly elected Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner has requested the resignation of all four members of the Kaya Hogan County Board of Elections. The two Democrats and two Republicans were formally asked to resign by the close of business on March 21, which sounds like today. Kaya Hogan County includes the heavily democratic city of Cleveland. Brunner's a Democrat who is elected Ohio's Secretary of State November 2006. Fellowly convictions have also resolved an 18 month prison census for two employees of the Kaya Hogan B.O.E. as we result about the county prosecutor in the case calls, the ringing of the outcome in the recount following the 2004 presidential election. Further problem surfaced in the conduct of Kaya Hogan County's May 2006 primary in a wake of which Michael who executive director of the county's Board of Elections recently also resigned in the did. In tandem, the shake up in Ohio's biggest county reflects a wideening storm surrounding the outcome of the 2004 presidential election. And the conduct of elections overall in the nation's most pivotal state. Among those Brunner's answer to resign is Kaya Hogan County Board of Elections Chairman Robert Bennett, who chairs Ohio's Republican Party. Been a responded to Brunner by saying that he refused to resign. He's placed the blame for the May 2006 primary problems on private voting machine vendors, including DiBold. Bennett claims the rigging of the 2004 presidential recount was caused by the Kaya Hogan County. Prosecuting his office according to the Columbus dispatch. To make a long story short, the election was stolen. Anybody care? Any interest? No. No. We already know that. Anybody have given credit? No. 5607.060. That's why I was pointless for me to sit here and read that whole entire thing. It's pointless. Right. Even you say that. That's right. They just don't care. What's that kind of to do with dancing with the stars? And this poll here looks like it's frozen. I could be wrong. Yeah, 148. Are we still on the air? We're getting ready to do a Marlin game or what? 1048. It's been stuck there for like, I don't know. I feel like I'm in suspended animation like Larry King. 132.0. 128. 128. Okay. Thanks, Don.

Well, everybody else said that he watched it. I wasn't talking to you. Because it's a party.

He's doing it. I can't tell you what he's doing, but it sounds to me like he's doing it. There's 247 on a full bottle. Not too shabby. There is so many snow from the White House going, but what the hell is that? What does that fast news? What do you expect? Something we said in that series. But don't stop me now. I'm on fire, Dad. Like scissor cats. Why I'm the scissor. Hey, now I want a personal note. This new life of leisure. A bad idea. Why I'll have you know why. Now the hot rob of skeletal women bite a pool.

We need, you know, we could still do it. What do you think, Chris? People really want to be nice. We can do it. Nice. You can do it. Yeah, that would be nice. I think tonight, I guess I don't know. Depends on how long I stay would buy and how much I lose. I was going to say we're going to watch Borat the one that's actually, I can watch with the English shirt. And what's the difference between this one you sent me? Yeah, I have one. Like Portuguese subtitle or something? Yeah, something. This one has the, this is the real deal DVD English subtitle, which is about half the jokes are actually subtitled because, you know, and it's great. And also like all the scenes that didn't make it into the theater version because the length you know how that goes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is very nice. I'm going to watch it. Because that, that thing kind of threw me. Anyway, we need 42 votes in 27 minutes. That's less than 2 a minute to get to 1200. But I think this thing is frozen again. I'm going to start to get a little bit suspicious. I think he's dealing with us today, you know? Don't you? It's still stuck there. It doesn't fit me. I keep refreshing it. I know we got a shot. And it's still, every time I refresh it, it still stays there. So maybe nobody is listening. You think that's possible? We have that 21 drop. 11 seconds. What? 1159. We have that 21 drop outs on our thing. I'm going to send out our micepace. What am I talking about? Oh, we got a few drop outs on our micepace. Make no mistake about that. And you know, I never, I checked. I double checked to see if Christopher did his research and we checked it on sure what thing. And he never followed up on it. You know, all you wanted to do was give me to play old meal again, which I didn't. And that was the end of that. You know, I'm easy. I'm easy, Chris. 1160 votes. They're coming in by the ones. They say we're going to need 40 votes in 26 minutes. And I'm doing the math as they say. And that's another one. We should have done it in a whole last Friday to do the math. Right. I mentioned it, but I don't think we ever put it on there. That is so freaking annoying. 1161. They're just trickling in by the ones. I think we better go back to the bedtime story, sir, tomorrow. I think I've chased the entire audience. And when I think the audience chased the audience away. Here's a thanks while we're waiting for the votes to pour up. And you'll see there. I'll click on one of these times. It'd be a big chunk. They'll come through for us. You'll see. 1163. See there's two. There's a pair. Oh, what a pair. Here's a note from Frank and Melbourne. He says a note on Judge Larry Court of the Pottsmoker we talked about. That story yesterday. I had a family location for the Court of New Year's ago. My exit taken our child out of state to find the court order not to do so. I managed to find who it get her served. She and her new hubby show up. He's a rich eye doctor that holds surgical patients. My argument was to have the court take the child from the ex-duty or heading flood to state and not allowing visitation. According to Florida case law, court assured of switch custody. Instead, after a morning of arguing, courted to clear his lunchtime break. We all leave, but the judge is an hour late. He claimed he would have had a flat tire. But the ex-duty husband were gone. They did so me letting go for a funeral. The result was they and my child left the court's jurisdiction. And even if court had ruled for me, my daughter was gone. Took a bribe, had a flat, had a tock, who knows, just is forget about it. Says Frank. He says, yes, I'm an attorney of a snooze where we did. Thank you, Frank, and Melbourne. And I'm so sorry that Judge Court had a lot of smoke of the fat one. Or whatever he was doing. How do you like that, huh? Don't freaking judge court. Hey, his hand. Oh, you're just really different. Never want to be a sweet different man. Or whatever you get, don't do as I do, as I say. That's the American effin' way. That's what they're the. That's what everybody tells you. Don't do as I do. Do as I say. They talk you like all of the logistics freaks. Give you a big son of dance. And they're all doing anything. If it's still warm, they're doing it. If it's a warm blow up dollar doing it. Even if it's lukewarm, or if it's like luke and Matthew. 1171, we need 29 votes in 24 minutes. That's barely over one minute. Now, those should think a high price, legendary show like this ought to be able to do that. Okay. But if it's just, I keep refreshing. And ordinarily there's, you know, it's beer for more here. 1172. They're coming by the ones. They're coming by the ones, man. This is not good. Do I sound like I'm getting an adjective? I'm getting ready for woodbots. I'm getting ready for woodbots. Yeah. There's a grass fire in Miami and CNN's going to have the details. It's kind of grass. And they got Tony Stoh. It's very, very portable to tell you what kind of grass. Good stuff for the regular. Columbia and we, baby. I don't know. Who the hell knows? Some crap. Let me take a look at it again. Okay. Let me just take a peek. 1172. See nothing has happened to none there. I think, I think, where you can save the juice on the transmitter. We're talking to ourselves. Even that, it requires is a dittler. And then all of a sudden, he'll then open a thing up again. There'll be like, 1240 at the end. We need 28 votes in 23 minutes on this show. That should be a no brainer to get to our 12 hundred. To get to our goal to make us feel good about this show is, it's one of these calls. It's one of these, we have mouth breathing idiots. 1173. See, I'm thinking, mix and match. That's what I'm going to have to do. I'm going to have to go back to mix and match. Mix and hoop. Mix and match. Mix and match. Like they say at the paint factory. Mix and match, baby. Let's mix up a batch. WQAN. Hello. A new could you play that African American? Absolutely not. Whatever it is, we're not playing it. There's another guy. Does he say hello?

And pace it with the key candies. It's time for the bubble mice. Maybe all over the list is Easter. It's all of stuff. So anyway, let's see. I got two of things here. It's better not having any. Well Chris says that that's all he was able to find. I'm sure with things which he sent me some language. I don't have time to do it around with. Because I got my shoes on now. My pantalones. I got my wood by winning shirt. I hope. It says I think George is right. Somebody's using Don sure what's named it. Try to muscle it on the show. Or maybe the guy that the insane asylum heavier number. You sure wouldn't believe that not today. Guys. It's an on house. And also I'm supposed to explain for my other body on here. Well not on the ear, but what a grasser is. I'm not going to tell that whole story. I'll send it to him. But the grasser. I mean, is that just a name I made up of? Was it something we just did a Michigan state where they had that everywhere? A grasser. I never heard that. But you heard me tell the story many times. Yeah. A grasser is when a bunch of like college guys. Like a place in the woods. You know? No matter where you live, there's always going to be some woods somewhere. Right? Why are you like it's like like you don't like I'm speaking a foreign language. And you take a bunch of blankets and take a carload of a broads and booze and whatever goes with it. The three bees, blankets, booze and broads. And you go out in the woods and you like a square round of a glass. And you're grasser. You're grasser. You're grasser. You're a racer. Yeah. I just never heard a call that you were. I'm an old fag. You know, you just called a party and that's you. Well in college it was a grasser. That's what I call it Michigan State. It was a grasser. I'm a straight court. It helps. He likes his grassers. In fact, I left my watch and my grassers right out there. That's I'm going to ruin the story. I don't want to sell a whole stroke as I've told a hundred times on the earth. But that's a grasser. What it is. And I guess I do have to explain it because maybe that's just a word that the kids made up. How do I know? You know? When you're in college your people kids make up all kinds of crap. Because there isn't what you're there for to be a smart ass and there's not to learn anything. I don't know. I'm trying to say. I'm trying to say. I like I've told you a million times. This is a damn good thing that I'm trying to think if there was anybody in my I'm I'm I for in my dorm and each show hall. I mean, you can say if there was any guy that we need looked even close to good and I went No, they were all ugly. Because that would have been pretty. Although as an ever fact, they did catch a couple of guys. They yeah, and my I'm I for. I don't remember who they were and they were ugly too. But they cut a couple of guys in the sack doing hanky spanky with each other. How do you like that? Uh, her. Yeah. How do you like that? God, and of course, can you imagine having to live that down afterward? Oh boy. Wow. I would have changed underwear and changed dormitories and changed schools and changed appliances. I mean, at the end, of course, this is back in early in 60 61 hundred years ago. I was in college. And you know what about you? You see, there's nothing more vicious more rotten than kids. As you know, right? Oh, yeah. And so he got somebody that you found out is a day or is like, well, whatever. You know, or likes to wear ladies underwear or whatever it is. And you catch him in the act of putting on ladies underwear or the act of, you know, hanky spanky with each other in the dorm room. I think, you know, when you think you'd lock the freaking door, maybe the roommate came in, you know. That's probably got to be a very unsettling sound when you hear the key in the door. I'll probably if they were like in the heat of passionate in here, the key in the door. That's right. So, probably a lot of any breathing going on. You know, so you don't hear that key in the door. It only stood out. And the door squeaks open and oh, no. What's going on in here? What are you laughing about? That's gotta be. Can you imagine anything more rather not? Well, not good. In fact, all these years, I kind of, I don't know. I didn't block it out like in, oh, we got 1194. We're going to make our 1200 votes. Let's hear it! All the bad. This is almost like a loser. But we can go Monday. We can go whenever it很好. I was. Remember that day when we got 1500 and some votes during the show? Back when we still had an audience. Remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But when you come right down to what I mean, what's the big deal? Look at 90. That's the 1200. Yeah. So that was a premature evaluation. But up until I started telling the story about the grass. In fact, I'm flicking this and it's still out of 94. That would be pretty embarrassing if we don't get the other six votes. So some of you who voted before, please do it again to make sure we get it. Because otherwise I would have gone through all that effort to play all that. It's still out of 94. I think Eric has got his foot on a break. This is a very spastic day here on this internet. You know, 1195. Now there's one. Oh, and the big news on the CNN grass firing my own. Oh, my god, I showed him WSVN. Now the rest of the world can understand how to be pressing this to live in my any. Grass fire. I wonder where the hell it is? They're going to have to have the grass or it got out of control. They were having a grass or it got out of hand, so to speak. There's not what you generally hope for. The grass is that it gets out of hand. Now look at this. This is quite a story. The hear off. вс CRECATIVEаксим because he cut her off according to the rest report. I should find a lawyer like cut me at birth and he cut me off big time. She initially told police she was a PBSO deputy when police asked for her ID. She removed the handcuffs from Ellen walk back through her 2000 BMW. She said she was making a citizens arrest for road rage and started naming people she knew in the Palm Beach, SO, Sheriff's Orifice.

Melon left and the two cars chased him and Otto put it in the police. Melon was boxed in and pulled over just like Donnie Briner there. He delivered box him and he's 4 and he's 15 lanes wide on the outside. He's at the outside fence. He'll never do a boxed on the end. Melon was boxed in and pulled over. Otto then cut them and police said, vocabalese pulled over when they saw the scene in the rest of the day. He was a driver of the Honda, filled up the crash minutes. The police thought it was a deputy that was helping out. Otto was the granddaughter of NASCAR co-founder, Edgar Otto. How do you like that? Oh boy, now the plot stick is just like the piece of it's getting really thick. Probably one we did it. I'm not going to, oh I'm not going to, oh my god. By the way, we used to stop hitting them buttons in it. That guy was right going at all, that old naeya. That was George's, that was George's, right there. That was mine. That was mine. That's like gay or not gay, you know we could have our old reading a few segments on the show and really probably get a least maybe a point three share yeah. Neil or George. Maybe I do. I'm waiting. Oh sorry. There ya go. I think I screwed up. I never do that. Well, I'm as far as the pattern. Yeah, I never do that. I'll be your pardon. For a long time you haven't screwed up in a long time.

That's from the advanced age. You know, you get to be old. That's another thing. Things like sprout up on your forehead, like on the side of your nose. They just almost got my glasses today. Pop up? Yeah, they do like that. Yeah. Okay. Oh, that's strange things. 1212 votes on the poll. We got to our 12-in-thek. You so very much. So many, many much. And you have to, they want to be. They want to be 100 years old and have lots of good memories, I guess. Is that what that's all about? Oh yeah. Or something like that. Yeah, I'll show you up. We got a band. Sorry.
