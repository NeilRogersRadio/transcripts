The music's pressed on the previous programs are those of the host, guests, and college, and do not reflect those of the busy Blackhead group. It's staffed, advertisers for agencies. The biggest names, the best talent. This is 4-3-5-60WQA. Miami Ford Florida Day. Rock solid. Yeah, we sure are. Make no mistake about it. We're so Rock solid that we got nothing going on now. What's going on? There we go. I forgot to add this one. It was on. It just wasn't an audition for it. Yeah, yeah. Why do you first do? Since everything ends everyone at Disney World is out of the closet 30-speed, we now have special K-days. We've changed the rides to suit our lifestyle. Yo, ho, ho. Be a splashfuckler on butt Pirates of the Caribbean. And we modify the tunnel of terror so you can ride with Mickey. And what kind of people generally are bigoted stupid people like him hardaway for example? I'm going to go with South Floridaians. And a lot of that in South Florida, you know, the word that comes to mind I've used this for years and years of South Florida, it's a perocule place. That's why when they call it a world-class city, I just pee in my pants laughing. There is nothing world-class about Miami, world-class hate. And world-class crime. And world-class bigotry. But there's nothing world-class. I mean, being an elephant in all the cities I've been in, and living in a place that's about his talent is any place I'll ever find in my life. I've got to know what it is. It's just, it's just pathetic how many narrow-minded stupid people I like to go to end of it. And I will say this. Everybody in their brother just love that show yesterday. Man, when Joe Bell comes in and just pees all over my life. I had to change my box who shorts four times after he got out of there this morning. My right-chris. Oh, definitely. And you also had a dump starting the day also, like that. Yeah, but you know, hate stuff. Yeah, I had a dump was in there, uh, tinkling all over the place, but that's not unusual for her. But anyway. We have to think tough for having keys to George's room also. That's right. It's a damn good thing that the Duff was in there because she's the one that got Chris in for George's out. He's not sick today, but this whole family's sick. So, it is served well day off for a little George. Okay. And it's a good thing he did have the day off because he was going to come and give me a lecture this morning about what a jerk I am. But I already know that. What'd you do? No, nothing unusual. It's just my insecurity. It's my stupidity and my general loving and jerk. And that's just the way I am. And he just likes giving me a lecture and he was going to do it again. And it's all for not. Everything is wonderful. Okay. My life is beautiful. You got it? Well, I don't think you're a jerk. I think you have your insecurities, but I don't know about the jerk's jerk. What is your story man? Chris was doing that yesterday. Sucking up and out. What's your deal? No, it's not going to be a fucking hot to go. Or three days ago. And I will. What do you just say? Say it again. So I'm sure I actually heard what I thought. I said I don't think you're a jerk. I think you have your insecurities. You might be on the right track to that. Yeah. Yeah. I know you're buying me a new flavor wave of it. So I see it. I'm not sure to be by the area. Well, I can't stop the delivery. So you don't have to kiss my ass. Okay. Nothing I can do to stop that. No, I just have had as you know, I've had a couple of months. A little bit of a rocky road on the internet there. To say the best. Starting with all the Jacob. He's at least in групп, of course I take that on other people, who are like, you know, a thousand times the person if that one would ever be. And I just get in. It's not right, it's wrong. So I apologize to all counselors. I'm just catchaually a jerk. But they know that and they're, you know, tolerant, as opposed to a lot of you are intolerance. Anyway, the call this morning on Kenny and Bo morning show. I'm sitting here and I'm assuming George is sick. There are a lot of things I assume. And generally when I assume something, it's absolutely correct. was going to be coming so because if he's out there by eight thirty eight thirty five let's hang on be there. And then Chris of course is having a little more technical difficulty left the feed the program on the back and I'm saying hey is anybody there what's going like just. It was a little bit. Well I think it was a George turning it off so I'm even worried about it morning. Yeah so you took it for granted but he wasn't there so I automatically turned it so far. That's okay I'm not giving you a hard time you guys do a wonderful job everybody's kissy kissy this morning on a spectacular mood my my life is sweet complete nothing could be better. Except listening to the kidney and bone morning show and I don't know what's being said on the other's foreshows and I don't want to rehash the whole show from yesterday but there's a lot more fall on lot more to be said and the color calls in kidney and volume he says oh well I took my kids to Disney world last summer and the there were guys holding hands in the one guy with his arm around the other guy and I really was in uncomfortable and nobody warned us about it. And I I'm telling you I just wanted to scream I just wanted to go to the window and open it up like Howard Beal and just yeah just scream out the window. When are you people gonna grow up and stop me and so for real. Saw two guys holding hands you know I can't think of any city including Rome and I'm sure the purpose into happy about it I can't think of any city of any size in a world that I travel to where you won't see guys holding hands and of course in Italy like I told you before and it's got nothing to do with sex or anything like that but the guys even the young guys. Now friends buddies they see each other maybe haven't seen each other in a day or two or whatever and they see each other and they go up and kiss each other on both cheeks and different culture. That's a cultural thing that's right but it and of course if they would have seen guys kissing each other on both cheeks, black girl, I'm not those cheeks but kissing each other on the face and immediately oh my god my kids what's going to happen to my kids let me tell you again about Amsterdam. So many things that I find amazing it's a frustrating city because they're living in the past in so many ways it's our cake and if you want to live there it's very difficult. I told you about and this goes back to the thing with soap and body wash you've got it but he was in body wash it went ahead of where I'm getting the soap dish. But back that's true but when I had the apartment there I had to go to like six places before I could find a damn soap dish because everything is so backward and so our cake. But the same token they have in the red light district are all these sex shops to keep a sexy shop and all these other places and they've got all these big deal those in the windows and all the sexual oriented stuff. To make a long story short you'll always see groups of like school kids they take tours of the thing little kids I'm talking about like five school kids take tours of the red light district. Yes that's awesome. Yeah and they're looking in the teacher was explaining better beat better but about nobody is like to be and of course then when you see the tourists especially from America and they're like walking by no I'm talking about adults not teenagers I'm talking about adults people in their 40s 50s old cochers like me and they're looking at this stuff and I oh my god look at that thing wow that's the difference America you know I talk about the British being constipated which they absolutely are and of course keep in mind who the people who settled in America and who the ancestors of you folks are for the most part but it's just pathetic to me how proof you'll sell for it is. I mean how unusual be to go to New York not just talking about in the village but just anywhere in the earth city or like in Chicago to see two guys holding hands or here in Toronto how how can you go on church street or young street here and not see two guys maybe with their armor on each other and what the hell does it mean okay are they're going to have sex out there in Disney world right now on the ride are they ride on it what do you people thinking about he was offended by I'm offended by user I'm offended by your ignorance and I feel sorry for your kids what was going to happen to your kids if they saw two guys holding hands well they'd have to ask him and he'd have to explain it and what would he have to say that their friends look the other way son yeah look the other way there where there are fairies there I want whatever yeah like that you know this business about there's so much hate in the world I don't want to start getting my yes I do I'm going to go off on my tangent here there's so much hate in the hostility in the world in the fact that there are people who care about each other who like each other who maybe love each other and yeah maybe they're having sex maybe they're not who knows what they're doing which is nobody's business if they're considering adults what the hell could possibly be wrong with that why is that offensive to people and I got news for a here in this city man you don't that that's the one one of the things that we respect tremendously about these people you don't dare I mean Tim Hardaway he'd have been run out of this town on a rail I mean he's got a right to say what he wants but they wouldn't put up with it for a minute here no what a crucified ultimately there would have nailed his ass right to the C.N. tower he'd be hanging from there right now he'd be doing a tower power hang he'd be doing the old Sodom routine you have a right to be as big of it as you want I don't care what anybody says you have a right to say any stupid thing you want and I agree with that business yesterday but the whole political correct the garbage is nonsense but if you're going to open up a big mouth and express bigotry against the whole class or group of people then you're going to get a real backlash and he already has you already lost one of his sponsors the car wash down there has been picketed this morning there are people really pissed off and fired up and rightfully so okay and I'm going to say it again if he would have been a white ex-athlete and he would have come on any radio show or anywhere in the media and said I hate black people I don't want to be around him I don't want to take showers with him I don't want to be near him I don't like black people just like my creatures the same thing and that's not what my creatures have been never less said if he and next athlete would have said that they would have been crucified and there would be anybody defending what they said but of course now we got all these homophobes out there pretending that they're not and I see a lot of these of blogs this morning wow you know the word homophobic is fear of gay people not hatred about and you're using the word wrong what the other person is a make you want to place in manics with it what differences make it's the same pile of crap and of course it is fear because we need to deal with stupid people they fear what they don't understand now it's interesting I'm guarantee I bet your life on it the tin hardaway took showers with naked with gave players during his career I guarantee I bet your life on up ten times of courts he did well there you go and did he get raped in the shower in the locker room did he get attacked he get molested was he being crueced in the locker room because somebody was gay this is the attribution this is America's general idea or at least a big percentage of what gay people are and of course how many straight people how many of you had a sexual people out there are in love with everybody who have sex with how many guys are going to the singles bars now many guys are going online to find some a hot chick that they can nail get a hot night and bed out of and and I don't can dead now what's wrong with that have a great time in enjoy life that's what I always say but all you perverted homosexuals that's all you know is sex and you're doing all these grotesque things and God didn't create Adam and Steve he created Adam all my guy I hear the stuff it's so stupid and so it makes me want to vomit and then when I hear the responses to it like my colleagues this morning I use the term colleagues loosely my sports nerd colleagues it just makes me nauseous he took his kids to the first of all I'm told that to anybody you know is offended by anything that goes on there that they get a you know refund and they get tickets for another day or whatever he might have planted that might have planned what getting a refund yeah let's say we saw two people holding hands will have another day at the parks and they saw guys holding hands how you know something I don't think the world can continue spinning around I think the globe is going to come to a standstill I think it's all soldering in galore all over again is what it is there were two guys holding hands you know I can't recall because you're often see heterosexual couples you know young couples in public getting a little bit carried away you know like maybe a shopping mall and yeah and I've done by them me especially if the guys cute maybe you're not complaining yeah I'm gonna start complaining about all you over ahead of what sexuales flopping your heterosexuality in public just so stupid man and that guy you think I hope you're listening now you jackass although probably you wouldn't be listening now because the old gay post is on you know you're an idiot anyway ten thirteen five sixty wc don't get worked up your lose your voice again then the josh and crystal after do the show no George day no her haze home pretending to be sick I mean he's all nursing a sick family and now friends from rehab this USA tarot conner talks about her battles with drugs and drinking about her recovery on Larry King live putting in duties as mis USA who's supposed to do you know so not go with the drugs alcohol really I think so okay exactly there's it leave you the wildest things sexual things whatever let's watch I don't think so I'm very insecure I'm very insufficient what was the worst thing about rehab I didn't get to use my phone be whoever desired alcohol I will maybe I can just have one one one one more song in a heart I'm okay I'm okay 17 there's another real credit to the human race and who the health care is about a cushy's hot am I right who cares I care about her well that's what I'm saying cushy's hot if she was a nasty looking slut you wouldn't you be saying what I slot what I like you know you are a reporter I beg your pardon I said you are correct now what did you say I'm not a jerk no you're not a jerk well I have my jerky moments and I apologize for that I'm an idiot at times and I'm a fool and you know an old sentimental fool but I'm in good shape today I'm sure you'll please to hear her that it's right that phone call I heard this morning I'm not I'm not real happy with the results of this poll so far I'll tell you that all let's take a look at yesterday's poll first this one really we run out of ideas for the poll I'm here for a bit of a bit of a bit have we run out of ideas are you not in the fact that I'm doing this one again maybe well I mean first he starts kiss my essence as I'm out of juice no I mean kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss kiss because I'm sitting in that new flavor wave and spent a hundred bucks on him I'm just not an anything I'm asking you like this is a you know no it's a repeat because Georgian I decided we had a little poll out on the air we decided that we hadn't done this in a very long time and I'm wondering if there's anybody still it's like people were still watching black and white TV this Chris use his body washing I'm using it for years okay he's a manly man and he uses bodies yeah had to get turned by you if you will I because remember when I started out you all right I was using the bar he and dropping it a lot is what I'm saying now that's a lot let's look at to that in the middle let's get to yesterday's poll where I did change my religion or lack of one I'd prefer to become we had fourteen hundred and seventeen votes but the bad news is they hated it I hate this poll twenty five percent three hundred and fifty five I don't think we ever did a poll where twenty five percent hated the poll these nine ever have maybe Georgians and atheists twenty three five a Buddhist two fourteen they want to rub that ball spot you can rub my little bit and agnostic one ninety eight a Jew eighty three a work in seventy six as I'm caughtic fifty nine a devil worship for fifty six a Catholic fifty one a Protestant thirty five a Scientologist eighteen do fairy a Mormon sixteen a Hindu twelve a she at Muslim seven a Sunni Muslim two you know when you stop and think about that who really knows what that's all about you know that whole raghead business I mean it's all a bunch of garbage but who knows what that's a differentiated between the Sunni's the she writes it's just well they're differentiated a female it's a blood bath okay let's look at that poll today like I said I'm dismayed if this I was just made when I heard that phone call this morning on the Canadian bogeon because it seems to be an ongoing theme and of course you know for some people have said maybe the fact that stupid tin hardaway open up a big mouth in fact John Amichi said he's delighted I'll get to that eventually I got a whole polygons stuff he's delighted that he brought it up because it points out very well is one of our stout contribute yesterday pointed out it points out very well that you know uh gay athletes can't come out of the closet because they live in this environment of hostility and stupidity and ignorance and bigot be a set of a look at to that right which do you bathe with that's our poll today and even Josh Cortes ain't too happy about it although look only a 2.9% hate this poll if it's you know it's it's important we're trying to educate the audience out there bring them into the 21st century in South Florida where most of the people are living like an stone age which do you bathe with male uses soap 425 male with body wash to 81 that that's you know what that is I'm gonna tell you right now acceptable is what it is it's ridiculous I mean 51% using soap and 34% using body wash oh we all men don't use body wash that's pansy stuff yeah right that's why a deities and all all the all the macho sports oriented make cause they make body wash for men says right on their for men for real men like the one on this spot I'm watching right now for sandals dot com wow anyway male uses soap 425 body wash to 81 I sell them bathe 46 that was a good choice I put that on there because I knew that would get a good response five and a half percent of the audience sell them bathe female uses body wash 30 I hate this pull 25 and a female using soap only 20 now of course you know what they're gonna say what is more and of course look what the small reason only 6% of the audience at least on the pole female we don't have any ladies how you do with ladies we're not doing well with ladies Josh's doing well with ladies I'm not a girlfriend doing not too bad good still Rick and I vodka keep her a booze up all the time good dot good thinking so 30 women with a body wash in 20 with soap on the mail side 425 with soap and listen it's a free country do whatever you want if you want like like I said live in the stone age if you like seeing a hair on a soap if it gives like some kind of an erotic twins or something more power to you if you like the scum on the soap but it's been sitting on a little legs there and the soap dish or whatever if you like that it makes you feel good smearing that all of yourself well hey more power to you me myself I mean I wouldn't go back to use and soap if you paid me if you paid me a hundred dollars a shower and I shower usually they're always at least once usually twice a day I mean there isn't enough money in the world to get me back to soap oh my god what do you all I can say it's like watching color TV but you people do whatever it has you want somebody wants to pay me I'll go back to soap by the way yeah you'll listen if somebody wants to pay you for anything you'll do it I don't even want to elaborate on that I'll do soap for 102 William well I look at the money you guys of course not that Josh says that now that he's abandoned us and making the big bucks on a QM website job I'm really have joy yeah in fact it wouldn't surprise me at all if this is the year that you're going to buy George that big sweet TV and buy him a nice round trip ticket to Amsterdam oh yeah stuff 847 votes on the pool and and just in fact it was to me like it's worse than it was the last time we did that pool I don't know when the last time we done our wise it's got to be months or maybe a year ago but it looks like they're going back to the soap they like the bar like you said they like the bar in fact I think most of these people have been spending much time at the bar and Italian judge today and headed 26 Americans in five Italians in the first criminal trial of the CIA's extraordinary rendition program the judge said to trial date for the 8th of June prosecutors elected five Italian intelligence officials work with the Americans almost all of them CIA agents to abduct terrorist suspects Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasir to many names from a means Milan street February 17th 2003 in Milan oh if you're going to go to Italy by the way don't waste your time going to Milan unless you had a lot of time in a lot of money I mean it's okay I'll write that down well it's like an in-doesn't that industrial it's like everybody says like New York I mean nothing is like New York but it's it just doesn't have the kind of architecture like in Rome or of footends or you know beautiful places Milan is kind of cold if you know what I mean and the food fat in order to literally fat these like a lot of that a risotto you know rice man I hate that you ever have risotto no don't Nasir was largely transferred by vehicle to the Aviano Air Force Base near Venice and then by heir to the Romstein Air Base in Germany on the Egypt for a credit say he was tortured Romstein I just love saying that they're a band what Romstein they are yeah they're well they're even popular in America well good for them all the one of the American suspects have been identified as CIA agents including former station chiefs in Rome in Milan the other as US Air Force officer station at the time at Aviano even if her request is made for Americans Expedition they move boundary irritate US attacking relations it was unlikely the CIA agents would be turned over for trial abroad the CIA is refused to come out in the case while a former Titan T. for military intelligence insistes insistes that the Titan intelligence had no role I'm just not not real happy about that body was thing I'm shocked you could not be over with a feather and that's the feather I could put my camp I guess or in my summer wow oh yeah there were two guys holding hands do you know how stupid that is seriously if you went out now if you went out to the parking lot right and there were two guys I mean you know who knows and I'm not talking about working in the building there but just two guys walking down 441 they're holding hand would that would that shock you would that offend you would you like oh my god we like have a nervous dumb no I just wouldn't look I mean whatever next no difference to me what do you mean you wouldn't look meaning like I'm not gonna zone in like oh two guys holding hands right you know zoom in I just whatever you know what about two guys holding glands oh I'm sorry 26 past 10 at 5 16 I would be Q.F. Friday you besties well come to me final segment of the final installment of the owl Franken farewell show finale John I'd like to thank all the interns and underpaid staff who were so eager to please me most of all I'd like to thank the air america intern who put my grateful dead ram on an old cartridge tape that Peter tripped here when it was a totally wmg hammer can we up can we hear that the one last time that there it is yeah you know that that added so much more body and flavor to my show because I thank you for that as you know I'm I'm leaving to pontificate upon a run for political arf is and yeah I'm not that I believe my own press you understand about just in case a old Tom Davis joins me from across my phone a high top what now look at it if I decide not to run for senator of the universe what do you say we form a comedy team again now I wish you luck with your run for office I just thought of asking more salt but he's much too close to death be turning you down on yeah so am I too take it that you would hang up now that Tom he's such a card Tom yes you know as the grateful dead one said what a long strange so sure that has been so I let me out exit state left by simply saying thanks for the memories I'm not gonna go away and that is of course to say should I actually run for office uh not I can always try my hand in a job at radio it's a job and that's well yeah he's a labor radio as if it makes a difference and go to run for a senator from Minnesota anybody care any interest in alphrani can we got 24 dropouts already we'll leave it on half an hour 24 dropouts on the public the general public come and subsidize your business and patronize you probably not a good idea to like be exclusionary and say oh I hate those damn cubans or I hate those damn uh white people or I hate the Jews not a good idea probably but then again ignorance is bliss that's what you're doing with is like that more than four years after she was accused of neglecting her duties during a bus primary the floor elections commission this morning dropped all charges and potential finds against former brow election supervisor myriam elephant how do you like that oh my god this is the last hearing it's over said Henry Hunter one of all offense lawyers it's really important for the people of brown county c she was exonerated is important to you out and don't important to me no fact it's rather depressing when you come right down with she lost your job because of problems with the 2002 primary when 23 polls failed to open by 7 a.m. and 32 polls failed the hey he'd an executive order from the governor's office to stay open past 7 p.m. so what does we cast about and they problem play the election she was removed from her post by then fan asked governor javosian 2003 she fell in a bid to rewinter job during a 2004 primary against Brenda snipes whom bush named a replacement in May 2005 the four to set officially stripped her of her title upholding wishes to see this is fender without pay the election commissioner first tried to slap elephant with a 55,000 dollar fine then we do said to ten grand insisting she was willfully and intelligently and neglectful of her duties during the primary but throughout her or deal she insisted she did not intentionally neglect her job it means she just incompetent is the word we're looking for you know i'm saying non-capist we miss her argument was bolstered by state administrative law judgements September will the state they failed to prove its case his decision was based on a peel court ruling of separate case where the elections commission was told to can't find elections for simply can't find election officials for simply neglecting their duties unless you're the intentionally set out to violate laws of disregard them i can't blackball and a higher for example two first election for bush those kinds of things so myri melvin she's off the hook for all time sake unlike tesio who couldn't get off the hook for all time sake can't do it Sally which do you bathe with eight hundred and seventy seven votes male soap four forty six male body was two ninety ninety fifty one percent the thirty four percent not even close not even close the soap crowd man said now let me ask you this um we'll have to find well we don't have anybody that's worked that that's played you know that recently in sports because mad dogs you know hundred years old and uh... who else we got we ain't got joy the boy anymore no we don't have no joy the boy but i'm curious in the locker rooms what are the athletes use you

he's like kind of a girly guy you know he's doing those new trejina spots that has to say that you know he's doing new trejina spots oh yeah i think two seasons ago like at the end of the year the middle year something that uh... you know gave out every player in this locker room one of the little baskets that they give it to you get a test get a task it he wants to see your basket that would you tell me don't tell me that Jason Taylor is going to turn out to be another uh... trejina i mean whatever eight hundred eighty two votes on the pool now i'm sorry it isn't trejina taking up some of

fun night and uh... i wouldn't have to put you know held your uh... i don't know is like that people that smell bad and i this is my model one of my many models in life if you can't look good smell good believe me i don't look good and you get a lot of funky russians at the uh... wood bind yeah i'll do this is matter fact in fact i i i probably shouldn't say this because it's gonna sound like i'm being a tin hardaway but and i don't have anything i don't see i don't categorize people in other words and well i'd take that back like french c-a-man's bigoted as anybody i'll admit it i'm not gonna lie like french i can't stand a friend second montreal i think montreal is kind of a neat place in some ways but there's too many french people are can't stand in Paris i mean Paris is beautiful in a lot of ways but you know the biggest problem with Paris too many french people there right the brits how many times i ripped the brits in fact it probably gets to the point where you're thinking does need like anybody yeah there's some people i like a lot but it's not i'd have but the russians it would buy in our generally speaking very loud and extremely obnoxious i mean it's like there there are a lot of these european people who show up there who you feel you want to ask them if they ever let you out of the house before is this your first time out of the public you know i mean they just don't know how to act around other people and they stand over your shoulder and they're talking different but i mean but i love the Italians at that way too very loud very demonstrative and very annoying especially when you're plunging and losing your ass like i was unfriety i'm maybe tomorrow morning i'll have a good machine okay if my connections with the lord out there are pray to the

taxes no and wouldies no BS okay this is a no BS placement no BS the odds are about the same no no no no chance but let me just tell you this about people being polite sometimes it's not such a good thing people being polite is not such a good thing no no I mean it's a great thing I love it I'm very polite when I'm here too because you just you know one in Toronto was the trontonians do but yes and am in my little convenience store right as I'm going out I got a couple of items my son diets so in the newspapers and I'm coming out of there and there's a guy with a beard well I would say about my age maybe a little younger maybe a couple of years older but he's certainly in the 60s and he's coming in and he holds the door and he said to me go ahead sir and and he said it very politely and it was a nice thing for him to do but it's just was him when he said sir I felt so old you know what I mean no it's almost like go ahead old conjure I'm not getting that you're just I feel like you're picking that's just a nice thing man that would never happen here ever I understand it and here it happens every day you at the you risk your hand in the elevator if you see somebody else coming real fast to get on the elevator we got a whole bunch of them by building but you reach out and you've jammed your hand in there so that the you know the motion sensor will open the doors back up and they can get on it and you risk it in your hand in it but he just he just nice people begin other nice people and hateful nasty people to get other haste you know the QM show is part of a regular SM program sonic sound salute which always recreated top 40 giants from WBC in New York to KYA and San Francisco and doesn't the cities in between before I've been getting to dominate the radio spectrum in the 70s and does the new programming formats split into the audience into nations top 40 stations attracted master audiences up to 70% of listeners in some cities that are unimaginable today's broadcast universe and the kids listen to them around the clock in the 60s not creeping through middle age go wild when they hear their old stations the first one I did was WKYC and Cleveland and the switch boards here just exploded says young who doesn't sure for my STEM studios in Washington and that's the seat that would be neat for me for like old-farts like me obviously the younger demographic I don't know maybe the young punk select here in them old jingles too and then of course you know it goes back to that business about the well I like this one better sitting around the holder hands here and in fact Josh and I are holding hands through the 1200 miles between Toronto and the studio in Miami are you holding my hand yeah that's it don't squeeze it so tight now that's a little bit faggy okay so I think the hold it's something to squeeze it in the hand too but anyway that was really emotionally of the day we talked about it the great length when you came in and said you love me I thought that was so so spectacular and I followed it up with can I be in your will I can assure you I can guarantee you as much as I like you I don't love you there are four people in this world that I love a lot they all know who they are okay but I don't you know I can't I've only got so so much to spread around you know what I mean just like to show I've only got so much manure to spread around all things to be like an almost endless supply when you can write down away anyway you're not going to be in my will I might be a little bit maybe I don't know how much would be how good maybe like to slave away of ovens for like no no I should say how much would be a nice gesture of criss I mean give me a like a small daughter my like five grand for God yeah I'm trying to be going to give me part of it or not I know fifty thousand right there fifty grand yeah but you know he hasn't done too much for you hey two year oh over two years I was a good job he's he's a good guy he's a good George well and but if I let him fifty grand how much would I have to leave George in a will I just buy it after the break let's come back and argue about meals will not that duty free case of champagne these are the things you can't take on a plane and she's with a hedgehog and a book and two days on clearance for all of those hits on your face you have back some burn but no solar that's one more thing you can't say on a plane I think you'll be waiting it may seem safe while they make you throw out all of those things you cannot take on a plane and I really frosted my ass where I would have picked a braille and I had to uh I mean I don't know how to go out and get no bag you know plastic bag and walk around like some kind of silly pansy with a bag full like you know shaving cream and after shaving uh toothpaste stuff like that so I threw it all out I didn't take any with me but the stuff that I bought over there threw it all out before I came back people are starving and I'm throwing off stuff that may be cost me like seven eight ten bucks not good damn last one of the takin' this ten bucks yeah nine hundred and forty two votes on the pool but then again I still do abuse so just relax not which do you bathe with nine forty two on the pool you had almost a thousand already I'm a mail I used soap for seventy four we're so sorry for you fifty percent of the audience is living in the distant past but then again they're living most of them in South Florida too so what does that tell you I'm a mail I used body wash three twenty one well this allude I sold a bat fifty eight female uses body wash thirty seven I hate this pool has got thirty men three point one percent and the female uses soap twenty two so the women thirty seven twenty two which is six point two percent of the audience female that's week really weak but in the mail category it's fifty to thirty four percent still hang in a cling into that soap hoping maybe that they drop it at any rate criminal charges will not be filed against a Disney employee accused of hitting a teenager while in costume is the character tigger thirty said that's one thing I like is a little closure you know as enclosure yet the state attorney's office announced yesterday that it will not press charges against Michael J. federalum prosecuted as made the decision after reviewing a complaint from the hamster resident J. Monica who in my opinion in my humble opinion was looking to make it quick foot hit Monica videotape is fourteen nine wonder if that was a doing gay days you think that maybe tigger was holding some guys hand that would have been really bad yeah what I would have been offended when you know I think of the things that I hear people say and I you know could be my age and haven't been around the world as much as I have and I think to myself what kind of existence have you lived what kind of sheltered in the end of thought jackass must you could you possibly be there were guys holding hands and guys with their arms around each other and my kids are with me oh my god God forbid that your kids should see that their guys who have a show of fashion to each other Monica videotape is fourteen year old son Jerry junior posing with a costume to federal him at Disney MGM studios in January and I watched that video several times there was nothing going on now nothing happened at some point a confrontation occurred between the boy and federalum it says I didn't see that it was just fun in them you know the father later watched the video tape and said federalum intentionally hit a son honor about the head or county sheriff official said park official suspended federalum thirty one while the investigation was being conducted a telephone call placed in the officials by the AP early to find out that one's employment status was not immediately returned so he didn't get charged but we don't know if he's still working there like I said if he's running around holding guys hands he's going to get fired it immediately that amazing I had a dump that thing out of that the Disney gate and that's a good bit too and so I didn't hear anything that you had it dumped you want me to play it again and dump it again I'm not gonna do that because you know I know if I left it in your incapable incompetent hands even though I do love you madly just the thought of it is so lucrative you know the dolphins this is the story that they and it took me over and I ought to get to it which is been I haven't even taken a call yet not that there are any right now there was several earlier but I'll get to them eventually so we hear some more good stuff yesterday did you hear the call or said that terrorism and is the same as the being gay yeah I thought that you are born a terrorist just like you born gay and that was a classic with a little spastic but it was classic so maybe we can get some more good stuff like that today very jackass however rights the dolphins are still mulling off for some wq way and it comes at seven ninety the ticket and word is the decision could go either way oh my god but regardless of the akhan and this is this is the most the body washing really turns my stomach with this news is some of the worst I've ever heard my life it's just amazing to me but regardless of the outcome Jimmy syphilis appears said to me turn is the play by play an answer the analist situation different story says very Jimmy syphilis who is so bad he makes he makes Joseph Gaki sound like mel Allen that's how bad Jimmy syphilis is I have never spoken to anybody who thinks he does a good job on the broadcast yeah it's quite quite the contrary everybody who's ever made a comment to me has said can you believe how bad he is can you believe how grotesque his performances hey Jimmy do fairy WQA must forward dolphins analist gym managed back on the broadcast all right if it requires ricebow would also be accepted to that incruent analist Joe Rose according to the officials that often like manage in rose if WQM reacquires the rights there are two scenarios that have been mentioned one a two-man booth with cephalo and manwich or less likely a three-man booth with cephalo rose and manwich rose at 790 contrary to expired early September if WQM learned rose to do a talk show and worked off and games would be a major blow to the ticket which assuredly would do everything to try to keep him rose very narrowly edge WQM's morning show in the last ratings book that's because Kenny wasn't talking enough about how much he got to that I'd be for at home but he certainly turned that around so to speak the issue is moved if the ticket were made and I didn't have enough homophobic calls on the air but last two days they'd more than made up for it seriously I mean bow I just don't get I mean bow it's big macho guy about eight feet tall you know could stop you with the one finger I just don't get it the issue is moved if the ticket retains dolphin rice but rose could face a decision if the dolphins moved to WQM does been here since day one September 1st 2004 and it's a very important part of our station said John weir general manager of the ticket general manager Stugots oh my gosh I'm for to have to producer to funky to a general manager because daddy's got a lot of money yep we want him here and anticipate that he'll be for here for a long time said Stugots can I just say something go right ahead okay all you want okay all the time people that are sending the article that you're currently reading yes stop yes like four four of the same article coming in as we speak how can I possibly miss this article you know if I was shocked you know I just want people to stop he's reading it right now I just got would maybe the funniest text message here in the history of my life from normal kid this is this is great we do share able to share it says I have amended I have taken the liberty and amended your will to include a provision for anyone who emails you on my space with a photo who is of legal age receiving a nominal stipend and sign photograph it's pretty good it says staff at the station will be advised you're entitled to photographs as well as a video feed of your coffin QAmin I started a station heavy broadcast in 2008 from woodbine there you go that's from normal wasn't that sweet that's very sweet so anybody who I've emailed believe me I'm not offering nobody in my will again for a long time I'll say that that's that's not a good tactic that's a good way to uh people panicking I'm not doing that I don't know what I've heard you're not going to woodbine anymore who told you that I'm going to marmorning I mean you you know you've had your phases like all not going and I'm like right no I had since I've come back from Berlin which is like week we can a couple of days now they I've had that and not had one winning day they don't they just aim paneman there is no good machine that's tough nice going normal that was a great I might have to read that again anyway I'll get back to the important stuff the ticket and QAmin the dolphin rides and how much which stations there would lose the money and Jimmy Siffle is doing the games that that right there that's and yeah that's the the big below if you will yes it says rose decline on potential scenario so as for Siffle is the dolphins like him being the face of the franchise from a broadcast perspective and both a ticket and WDQM would be comfortable with him returning on play by play the ticket learned the dolphins from QM two years ago but got the team to restructure its contract last frame because it was losing its ass on it losing my versus losing millions as part of the deal big one of six is permitted to carry the games on fn now they QM 790 battle for races at toss up when they decision coming soon and then says very it's coming soon so a whole bunch of people are fixing that in while I'm reading it on the air yeah maybe the lab in catch up in my way speaking of the lay I don't I don't want to start belly aching about it but what you told me yesterday Chris about that that's not what I've understood about this thing yeah well I don't know if that's they had a definitely for you for a while but ever since we got those delays in for the hours they're in show yes they are well that's not what it was before was like 30 second delay well whatever it is it is well we used to actually have two 22nd dumpable delays it was like a double double then oh yeah I'm playing a stuff was actually in charge of that during the Howard Damage or the Howard story and then when we went into Howard again he was in charge of the double one of the yeah that was doing the double done and that's when he was going like that very mysterious show that was the it's amazing how it had any numbers on the station because it was like listening to a piece of Swiss cheese there were so many holes through it but nevertheless was it really active ingenuity to be putting that on there I saw in there uh Joyce that was a Joyce thing too Joyce and the beesleys brilliant nine 67 on a pull we're approaching that thousand mark which view bathed with mail with the soap for 86 over 50 percent mail with the body was 327 see I mean makes no difference to me I'm not going to be taking showers when you guys anyway so what what difference does it make to me but it just it just isn't our aren't you a little bit shocked by that no we look if I took a poll saying what kind of TV do you have color or black and white and 50 percent said all moshin black and white TV I just don't get it I sell the bay of 59 female body wash 41 hate the pull 31 female soap only 23 so to leave and of course the guys would say well the ladies of course because it's a

gigantic ears maybe that last song I played this for him I don't know first rain looking guy but who might be talking about strange looking guys I better shave the hair out of my ears anyway getting back to Tim Hardaway in the fact that there um parade and around his car washed under the cables and boycotting and treating a big simist he present in the head coach Pat Riley coach Charterway during his heat ten you said he was a little bit shocked by some of the words that he used that kind of it's thinking can't be tolerated just can't rather send you a WQAM radio interview but I do know Tim's a good spirit and I'm sure now wish he could take all of that back and I hope he's not severely judged and is what Pat said Hardaway's comments could hurt him financially bald guys a new jersey based company that makes grooming products for bald men dropped him as a spokesman Thursday for months after making him the first former pro to represent the two year old company bald guys like bald this does not just go to a based on lifestyle choice color and let me get back to that in a second to remind me about lifestyle choice in fact that's interesting that they use both those words there color education financial resources religion physical capabilities in any other way Howard Bronner CEO bald guy said in statement mad form in president the national game must be intense force released a statement calling Hardaway a hero the thousands of young people and that's what makes his comments so troubling sadly his words simply put the pervasive homophobia in the NBA on the table is what Matt said before I go on about that that business about lifestyle and choice well the thing we that with that jackass I call yesterday about the realizing we're deciding what your sexual orientation is yeah it's not a choice you are what you are in fact I got a really ugly email about that on our one we have probably one my space friends by the way now probably one wow that impressive you're probably even amazed yours is never impressed he's just you know he's beaten down old man as buddy is and I feel bad about that but nevertheless trouble one is not bad and I got a very ugly anonymous message about that well oh yeah like since when is there a gay gene and all this other stand I immediately deleted it that leap up and worse wonders it's fabulous from some pro father didn't exist with somebody with no name that kind of crap that's what it's like the anonymous colors the same crap behind the shield of anonymity everybody or at least most everybody is a real ballsy guy you know the fist business about lifestyle the gay lifestyle well what does that mean is there a straight lifestyle there's lifestyles of the rich and framing I know that what does that mean the gay lifestyle leaves that expression all the time it's a lifestyle a lifestyle choice even by this jackass who's a you know all over the place not a choice it's not a lifestyle it's what you are it's who you are and what you are it's in your brain it's part of who you are period get over it that's my suggestion to fan not apologizing to anybody for who I am what I am I'm a dottering old queen with a very biting sarcastic cost extensive humor anybody doesn't like it go away that's all that's my comment just to get lost get out of my way I'm gonna be in a box soon lifestyle my ass oh sorry anyway hardaways got an ownership stake in several South Florida businesses a person wasted the full of Tim Hardaway's US one car wash mind would be declined to be identified for obvious reasons said that more than 20 people had called a complaint but that customer flow had not dropped a man who identified himself as the manager at Hardaway's house of wings in coconut grove deer to climb to comment Tim Hardaway's house of wings in the grove they're boycotting already this see this isn't a hill from earlier but they're boycotting at this morning the car wash. Hardaway's comments followed last week's disclosure by former NBA center John Meachy that he's gay and meachy was promoting a book told ESPN radio yesterday the comments by Hardaway and people like him are the loud comments that pollute the air these are the comments that create the atmosphere that allow some of the tragic incidents of homophobia that we've seen some of the deaths. Is it his fault is it him that makes these people do these terrible acts? No but it creates the atmosphere of dismissiveness in which important people think it's okay to treat gay people this way this is what makes the lives of gay and lesbian young people in school miserable said to me cheap. Hardaway played for the heat we know this but a beeper several teams he's the first interest to return the roster but they said uh-uh and what do you think now I think the chances are pretty good now no. The incident sparked a call from the post sports teams to put their players to sensitivity training instead of being in denial about homophobia and sports they need to take action said saves Pina but that's some organized age-nature media that part of the story Pina Pina it's time for the NBA and the NFL to bring in people will sensitize the players to these issues we would facilitate it and gay ladies put it out for heat's popularity with all kinds of fans and if he thinks homosexuals are not sports fanatics he better wake up in smell the coffee said Rod Berneski co-founder and president of the Unity Coalition mommy did leading his spanic gay rights group how do you like that? there are plenty of heat fanatics who happen to be gay and we go to those games said Ron said Ron he born that's going on he boy all right so they fall out continues they got a big article here from a raw story about it in the kitchen good time you know yeah well there you go what's my mean what's the point this is our own uh gay or not gay segment yeah what did we come up with the oblong table oh is that story the squirt table if you're in the trying to get me started into a you know attack on that morning show go right ahead it just isn't going to happen I mean what what's the point what is there for me to say that I haven't already said you know I'll tell you one thing I haven't said that as we got a thousand folks we got a thousand two votes already slightly below him 30 yet that is really fantastic the only sad part of it is the result I mean look there's no point in taking a poll if it always turns out the way you expected to or you wanted to or whatever but it's just uh shocking to me which do you bathe with body washer soap on the mail I use soap 505 still over 50% clean into that soap squeezing it tightly and of course you can squeeze the soap tightly it tends to like squirt out of your hands and then you have to bend down and pick it up the mail body wash 337 I saw them bated 60 6% of the audience saw them bates female use body wash 43 I hit this poll 32 only people 1% and female who use the soap 25 so we got the let's see 6.6% of the audience female let's send that to a setting but nevertheless almost 2 to 1 the females with body wash and like I said all of this is reinforced the mushroom guys out there see that's for the ladies Neo what are you gonna get what and stop acting like some kind of a lady the biggest name so best talent to ever visit the unrocked sports radio 560 well Friday you bested yo yo yo this is Kevin federal line K-pad with exciting news for those of you wanting to lose weight yeah I'll admit I was getting a little fat on the gravy chain so I decided to do something about it well actually something was done for me but screw her you know anyway introducing federal line K-zine federal line K-zine is the easy way to lose weight because well you don't eat much because well you can't afford to federal line K-zine is awesome this is state mm hmm wham Frateradas 하 out and back in the restaurant and the big green box. It's like a buffet. Fetter lean cuisine. Not just a diet. It's a way of life. Yeah, I love having mean cuisine. It's 1131 at 5.62. Here's the schedule for this afternoon. We got mad dog at 2. Power hour with a Humphrey to mad dog together between 4 and 5. Humphrey solo 5 to 7.80K. 7 to 10 tonight. Isn't it amazing how many people like to kind of go away in the night?

I guess he got overwrought with a motion after I told him I loved him so many times. That's it. We ought to take some calls this half hour. Don't you think? How have the calls been? I've been listening. I haven't gotten any better since I've just... What do you mean by that? I would say this week since I came back from my well deserved vacation. I think they have been that bad. Am I right? Chris M. and two men? We've had some decent ones finally. Of course yesterday. I mean, how can you beat those couple of calls? The guy who made the case for me. I couldn't $1,000 wouldn't have paid for that call. When he's given me a song that ends about it. It's being gay as not a choice now. He could mean the interrogation. And then he said, well, I asked him about how did he know he was attracted to females. Well, when I was at a lesson, I realized, and then after I kneeled him on the realized that he finally changed to decided. He decided he liked ladies. He made the choice. Like somebody put a, you know, like one from Colombe, one from Colombe, and a Chinese restaurant menu, that kind of thing. Maybe he decided after a guy turned him down. Maybe that was it. Maybe after all the guys said, get lost. Luser. Maybe that's what he said. Maybe the ladies will put up with my crap. I doubt it though. WQAM, hello. You like my... Oh, I missed this. Let's keep going. For your radio wound up, I think that flavor wave man, you're easy. Jesus. He's like, don't look at her. Huh? He's hyped up for it. Don't jump in Jack's trying to break. That's because your source said it would be back on the show and you know it. Of course, I love the show. In fact, if they would have paid you the same money to just stay on this show. Now, of course, crystal like here in this part, because Chris is doing a fine job. Don't get me wrong. But I'm just talking about your altitude. If they'd have paid you the same amount of stay on the show, I said what they're doing to that goofy QAM website, you would have said, that's my brothers. I'd stay right with the old man. Is that even like a question or... Well, there you go. Say it and rest my case. WQAM, hello. Anyhow, are you doing? Okay, sir. I mean, answer your question. What come if you're a straight guy like Tim Hardaway? You assume that if somebody's gay, they're going to be interested in you. Yeah, oh, sir. You have just touched on one of the greatest things of all time. And that is that so many really grotesque straight guys think that all of us think that every gay guy is uvelling all over them, and just dying to do something when they're going to say You know, I wouldn't want to see days in the army because what if you're in a foxhole, and you're going to die, and the guy might do something to your dying wishes to be with this guy. I mean, it's horrible. I think he's got his horse on next up. Okay. Thanks, Pal. Okay. I think like that. But that's one of the things that us facts talk about all the time. It's how many straight guys think that every fag, every gay guy is uvelling all over them, and just dying to do something to do something. And the meantime, wouldn't touch them with your hand. You know what I'm saying? No. Yes you do. Don't give me this no. You know exactly what I'm saying. W2QAM. Hello. QAM. Yeah. It was the amazing with you. You're gay, but you know so much about sports. I can't believe the things that come out of your mouth. And how you know everything about sports is blows me away. Yeah. And you're gay. Yeah. So. How do you do that? Oh, it's a mystery. I can't explain it on the air. It's a mystery. You say the cause I'm good. Oh man, he was sensational. You're gay, but you know all this sports stuff. And you're a big hockey fan and you go to all these, uh, used to be a dolphin season ticket over for years and years. And he wants to leave speed to flyers for two last night, the pathetic flyers. How do you know all this stuff? Gay has gotten a, it's just, it's just, I mean, while they're even trying to answer something like that. But that, that's the ignorance man. It is rampant. And when you understand that it's ignorance, it's not as bad as just plain hate just for the sake of it. You know, it's because people are stupid. Yeah. Every gay person is like, you know, singing show tunes and putting on mascara and dressing up like the ladies doing a little cross-ressing and doing like that. Wow. W2QAM. Hello. This thing is starting to get funky again. I don't think I need to punch down. I'm hitting it again. There you go. QAM. Hello. Hey, Neo. Yes, sir. You know what? That's your mind. I mean, any of the polka-ly straight guy that gets that man on the radio has got to be gay. Is that it? Oh, yeah. And I guess, uh, if you're mad, you're gay. Okay. If you're gay, you're mad. Hmm. Dark, dark, dark history of the dark regions are coming up. Now that's a very good sign. Oh, yes. And it is cold. 2020 votes on the poll. Maybe I'll have to make a little tea during this next break. That'd be good. Some of that constant cement. Constance cement. That's what it is. That's a very good name for it. It tastes like cement. It's the worst taste in tea, but it works very good. See, if there was a god, would he really make things that are taste rate, bad for you and things that are good for you? Taste horrible. Although I am, I love those people that hates broccoli, Georgia's like that. It hates broccoli, hates cauliflower stuff. I love that stuff. What's, what's not to life? You don't though. No, I, I, I, I, I love broccoli. I cauliflower. I can see you guys have a cheese lover. And so like, like, it Ruth Chrissie can get like cauliflower, broccoli, I'll rotten or spinach, I'll rotten. And man, I could just eat that by the, by the gallonful. I just love that stuff. And it's good for you. Oh, it's all a heavy cheese in there. Of course, probably goes in or your clog your arteries, but nevertheless. See, if there was a god, he wouldn't have made constant cement tea. So good for your throat. It's soothing and it goes down good. That's what Kathy will let's say. WDQA in, hello. Hey, Leo. Yes, sir. The only thing to give me about getting home is still seeing with the same with bag on with now. Throwing it all with the same woman. And that's what you call. Okay, well, I don't blame you, probably, from the sound of it. I'm not going to have to. And if I, I just said, I might do that for tomorrow, but he's, he wants to get out ahead of the give me Monday, but yeah, yeah, Monday. Coming into tomorrow, do you? Well, you know, right, you're Saturday. If you're on the watch, Paul is going to continue all the way through the weekend, then, huh? That's right. That is today's pool. Well, see, I get so far ahead of my self on here. Did you notice what I just almost said? Oh, look. Oh, look. Yeah, just like that. Like, finally got that, huh? Oh, yeah. Oh, look, look. Oh, look. Oh, look. I got it. I don't have the little Richard thing. No, I'm very jealous of that. Monday morning, you know, forget Chris. I got to get that steel out from you. Okay. I'm, maybe they'll put that on the next disk that they send up here. Okay, who I am? Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. Grat him by the collar. You know, you could take him out any time you feel like it. Get a little bit more open minded. Okay. This ain't no thing. You know, like that. But I'm, I'm almost positive that the kid wouldn't even have noticed anything. Right. You know, if the dad didn't say anything. Oh, the guys holding hands there. It's daddy that's peeing in his pants instead of going to risk breakdown because daddy's probably in a freaking closet.

I just had a little technical error here in the studio. What happened? I just pulled the microphone off the stand. I'm trying to adjust it. Yeah, it's just hanging like incredible. All the time. Well, maybe not pull it so hard next time. Try not to. 145 votes and little under 50% of the guys using soap. The ladies, however, 46 body wash and 26 for soap. I mean, you know, this is a little bit almost like paper or plastic. You know, maybe we'll do that one next week. Maybe maybe they got a call then about to the pull about getting old. Maybe he can call it about a per or plastic. What do you say, pal? Come on. You can do it. Anyway, getting back to part of way and the had a big thing on CNN about it just now. There was Charles Barkley on their participating in Spitting of People too. I thought that was a little bit over the top. Former NBA player John Amichi and the Englishman's admission of homosexuality with a hard line stance against gay players named B from a hard way, but it would be better to move. But about the hard way said he hated gay people. And Amichi, whose book on his positive life of the NBA was published Wednesday, would not have been someone a hard way. One of those a teammate. First of all, I wouldn't want them on my team. And second of all, if he was on my team, I would, you know, really distance myself from him because I don't think that's right. Hardaway said. He doesn't think it's right. You know, I don't think he should be in locker room while wearing locker room. I would be want to be a part of that. There's a lot of other people I hear are like that. They're still in the closet. I don't like that. He just don't like it. You know, Tim Hardaway don't like it. Amichi has said there are other gay players in the NBA currently, so it's entirely possible. Hardaway has had homosexual teammates and they haven't even known it. Hardaway who told him I'm a TV station. He wouldn't speak to a gay family member, apologize for his comments in a statement. And of course, they always do that. When it starts, you know, the public reaction is bad. When you start losing all your contracts, then oh, I apologize. Sorry, anybody I offended, but it would be better to be put about. What is the English? What? I was going to say when it's age and told him he screwed himself, he won't have any more gigs. Now, shop your stupid not-to-jack-ass. Beyond mirrored issues of locker room trust and bonds among teammates, Amichi said hardaway's words of anger and intimidation show why gay people worry about making their sexual orientation public. And now allows people to take off those rose-covered glasses and understand that homophobia is a problem not only in sport but in society. Amichi told ESPN, published in his book, spewing vitriol isn't something we should give credit to for sparking discussion. Society's not for that. One has made hundreds of-one man has made hundreds of thousands of people not feel uncomfortable on safe, feel they should hide and run. What he has done is made like more to the gut perhaps more dangerous for people on society and not just in sports has used him bold in those who hold the same views. When the person lies, it's not just a foolish comment, it's a foolish comment that echoes around the country. People will feel under pressure like they're under attack. They'll feel anxious. They'll know there's a face and a voice for all those people out there who hate them. I don't know how that can be conducive to any kind of society at all, Amichi said, Amichi who's black, rejects the idea of mere tolerance for gay is saying, I have no interest in being tolerated as a black or gay person. Well, I say amen to that as a black as a gay or a white person or black. Amichi said, I'm a response to his revelation has been overwhelming me positive. Hardaway's comments have touched a wave of threatening anti-gay messages beyond what he'd been receiving. Every comment that hardaway made is labeled with hate Amichi said, the percentage of emails I've gotten overnight that are going to have to go into a little box somewhere just in case I end up dead are un-feelable. That's what he said. Un-feelable. Just like that he said it. He's been a lightning rod for people to finally open the flood gates into sight and say some pretty awful stuff. These are the comments that create the atmosphere that allow some of the tragic incidents of homophobia that we've seen Amichi said. This is what makes the lives of gay and lesbian young people in schools miserable. It's what stops gay and lesbian people in the workplace from coming out as well as the fact that they can be fined in 33 states for being gay said Amichi. Here's a very important fact. I'm sure it says, oh, Paul suggestion. Oh, I like that. That's not too bad, right? Gay people are born that way, choose that life, which they were straight. Our all-flamers are easy to spot, want me or love him hardaway. A lot of good choices on there, huh? A little bit on balance. I would say that's from down the street at University of Dodge there. It's a Kimberville camp which is joint. Really, isn't that the thing I fear about growing old? Paul came from too? Oh, well, I'm just thinking. Yeah, it is. I'm looking at it. Yeah, it is University of Virginia. I'll get Zillions of taxes from down there. So Kimberville workmates or maybe Kimber himself, I don't know, nobody ever puts names on these. You know? But there are a lot of people who would like do stuff like that who have an already working all day and so they send you all kinds of taxes and text messages and stuff like that, which is great. Mad Dog would call them corporate time stealing leads corporate time stealing leads, which is fine with me. The list, I'm all for less work and more pay. I've always said that and that's my motto. Less work more pay. Just show me the money, sweetie. Man, that is scalling hot. I think I've pulled that water a little bit too long and it's hotter than a which is knuckle. Thousands, 49 votes on the pool and we're down to 49.8% on the soap. I mean, that's that it makes any difference. No matter what the result of the pool is, an anchor has changed one person out there. There's still going to be squeeze in that soap and it's going to be flying all over the wall and etc. WQAM hello. Yes sir. How much was it brought out? WQAM hello. Hello. Yes sir. I'd like to be to the office. Speaking. I guess if gay men are allowed to stay in the locker room with straight men then heterosexual men should be allowed to be in girls locker rooms or girls should be allowed in men's locker rooms. I mean what's the difference? What's the difference? We're back to that and you have a bunch of men running around and you know your practices to men wouldn't be the same as the heterosexual being in our locker room for women? No. What's the difference? What's the difference is that homosexual men are really isn't technically any difference but what would be the point? I mean we obnoxious. What's the difference? We see you are assuming you're assuming which the guide mentioned before you're assuming that all homosexual men want to hop on every other guys bones. That's what you're assuming. I just think that it's not right for them to be able to stare at a bunch of naked men. What do you mean they're staring at how do you know they're staring? What do you mean if they're staring? How is it a locker room? I mean it's hard to miss. You know what it sounds like? It sounds like the voice of experience to me. That's what it sounds like. They're staring at them. Yes. I report on the hurricanes for the station you know get interviews and stuff for our things. The female sportswriters are allowed to go into the male locker room for several years now. I tell you every time I've talked to one of them and they've talked about you know most of the players are good you know when all the reporters go in there when they once they've opened it up you most from cover up. Some of them it's almost like on purpose. They just stand at the locker naked. They're hanging every single female reporter has said they personally ate it and that like in couple of them will make sure they bring in pads. They can you know position it so that they're not seeing anything. The other thing I've never seen before is what this guy just said is this. How many episodes has anybody ever heard of? Have any athlete being attacked by his gay fellow athlete in the locker room? I've never heard of that in my life. Have you? No. Never heard of it. Doesn't happen. It doesn't happen. It's just stupidity. Yeah well we shouldn't allow him in there. It's just not right because they're staring at him and they're looking at their good aim and what about it. How about if I'm sitting in a shopping mall? I'm out there. I'm staring at the hot looking young guys okay? Is that make me some kind of a proverb? Yes and I'm glad to be. I mean what does it what does it do to somebody? Why are you so threatened sir? What is it that you're so concerned about? That you're so off-cyt about it. And again this goes back to the same deal even though he denies it about air. We want to these homophobes things that air we gay guy is just dying to grab a hold of his goods and get him in the sack and do air we which way and all this other crap. Stupid is what it is. W2QAN hello. Yo it be oh you know. So many people make me laugh and we guys a lot of little little little little little little bit stuff like that but who really cares? If you're if you're at the way I look at it, if you're a company and your sexuality, you don't matter who's around or what it's around. The thing that the one thing I wanted to make a comment about him are the way that make kind of make me laugh is that the people should do is really hear them more and hurt the hit of the his pocket. Don't go to his cry wash, don't go to his part-by-sick and let him see that being the air game first that I'm excuse me not air game being hitting you it will really hurt you somewhere or another so how about a hit you want and maybe you'll take it away from the pocket kind of great being no. Okay thank you yeah he already lost that one contract with that's a ball ball these whatever that kind of ball you go got and he's not gonna do TV no more right really and the a and he's not he you know that he was an NBA analyst and there's not an animal not a lot of he was an analyst maybe that kind of like a shine to spotlight in the right area back to him or something. 158 votes on the pool but if you're gay everybody lots of talk about I'll say that you know open up a big stupid mouth as if there's something unusual in sports opening up a big stupid mouth because most jobs are more on's okay not all of them there's some very bright guys remember build Bradley who went for president even though he spoke with the luck kind of like a speech defect but he was a very bright guy NBA basketball player build Bradley remember yep and there've been a few very educated the athletes and some of actually graduate college and get a degree and maybe attended a few classes and have some textbooks but generally speaking sports is not for how he educated folks I'm talking about playing in it it's for the the like dumb like give me the ball give me the ball that kind of crap slam a jam slam a jam of this the biggest thing slam up in the game is the message you rockers sports video 560 m art Morgan is the 12-1 hour on q 8 m first thing I said when my plane finally landed last week oh

I think back to those days when we were taking showers together in gym class in high school I mean they're going to work school me because I was some kind of a pansy I was looking what are you

when it comes to biology there's nothing written and stone okay you got her map of guides who have come with both parts you have and then say get the homework they'd realize that every person who's born on this planet is born up email until a certain fact is make a decision between the two so I think that you go do their homework before they realize you know that they're more on when they don't do homework sir more and don't confuse them with the fact that's not gonna do any homework you're absolutely right sir and have a great day and of course all those evil animals you know all those that they're gonna burn in hell all those homosexual animals all through the uh mammal kingdom there are homosexuals but it's you know and since the beginning recorded time must be just evil people I read a lot of those letters in the like I said in the red coatized blog and the heraldest mark and just enough to make you a vomit that kind of spewed them that people come up with and oh you know I have no toleration for that kind of crap that kind of crap in the world just filled with hate God forbid that there should be any two people forget who they are who actually have any kind of positive feelings to which of them who might put their arm around each other like to give them a hug or hold it to somebody's hand and it's just doing something positive to somebody else oh and god only knows what they're doing in the bedroom and like I always say why is it your business why do you care it's say it would be like my worrying about what heterosexual people are doing in there but what what do I care what what is that to me why does that affect my life what I mean what is that for me to worry about am I right yeah yeah we're back up on the streaming we only had 26 dropouts haha oh this place man I I there's no point to it and it's never gonna change and I keep saying it only because it keeps my sanity but this place is just it never ceases to amaze WQAM hello haha okay I think he's got the funds back on his throat QAM hello you know what you're hoping you're right yeah hoping you're a pass yeah WQAM hello not there they're good I told you guys they're better than ever today okay QAM all week long QAM hello hey no how are you okay sir um it's far as the whole heart of everything is concerned I got a totally different outbreak if you give me a second the whole warming oh yeah yeah I got a different outbreak it's kind of I like the fact that he came out and said something because it shows how people have not really changed and hopefully there will be a change after that you know I mean it's just if I sit back and I know it's different but I'm married to a white woman and I'm black but we get these stairs and you know all this other stuff still to this day and we thought things have changed and I'll see they see that's another difference now where do you live I live well I get you to say in call Springs okay so you're in South Florida see and for example here in Toronto because there is such a multicultural city and there are all these people from China and India you see just zillions of mixed race couples walking down the streets you know like black guy with a Chinese chick or the other way around it yeah I mean just and nobody pays any attention to it because it's so commonplace that it's no thing you know I'm saying this mean anything kind of like the Europeans when it comes to making this on TV they don't really right because they see it all the time but yeah that is correct I'm hoping we can actually change something here you know in America like or at least within ourselves because if you think about it this thing coming out it gives an opportunity to teachers to go to kids and say look that was wrong and you have to turn it around but teachers are gonna do that that's not gonna happen because then no teachers aren't allowed to do that because then of course that's when the Christian rights starts you know Rattland their spirit and all that out of shape and you're teaching over in life styles and that's not all as other crap you're just telling me we're all doing I'm not gonna say we're all doing but I mean it's just to gonna take a very long time I mean we're working little tiny baby steps and then along comes some big jackass like this opens up a dumb mouth and opens up all the wounds again as all he did just like John and Michi said I got you know I do understand the whole you know about opening up a sore wounds but yet if it wasn't open knowing we'd be talking about it everyone would just not you know just just

ordered a salad and a shallot well that sounds uh we'll have to fry those should be in the fries what is it with everybody in the fries you know like the only sane person in the world but i always tell everybody but i'm the only sane person or you're the only insane person in the world that doesn't like fries i never said i didn't like them but i don't like them enough that i can't live with all of them and others i know they're very bad for me and i eat a lot of other crap that's bad for me look you always heard me say this and i'll say it again for the eight billion time if i'm gonna eat something a lot being the diabetic that i'm gonna if i'm gonna cheat and i'm gonna eat something that i really shouldn't be eating we're certainly potatoes are carbohydrates in their poison for diabetic but if i have to choose between like french fries or like maybe a pint of ice cream which one you think i'm gonna choose well Josh there you go take the ice cream okay i mean you just can't be cheating all over the place and especially when you try to lose some weight and be a little bit spelt and human looking which i'm trying desperately to do good luck with that what do you mean by what do you down to you said you have one eight right for by the way mister one eighty four you know that's the lowest i've played again this morning was still one eighty four not too bad that's the lowest i've weighed in in more years than i can figure last time i remember to get in down to like it was one eighty six and that was uh oh i don't know maybe ten years ago you're doing good man keep it up one eighty four yeah and uh go get some fries fries are fattening their bad for you they're like deep fry and you just can't you know you can't eat carbs man let me say it again if i'm gonna eat

nice parmesan or somebody would say parmesan cheese and sprinkle it all over the place that's that's a good meal that's good for you not bad for you but french fries are bad for you they're deep fried can i say it's like corn dogs ever have a corn dog yeah i think that's for red necks yeah i'm not a big fan you know what else are for red necks biscuits biscuits and gravy now do we have any hearty's we've been through the cement in times i guess we do have a hearty somewhere in southward and not too many of them not southward uh uh tampine over there all of it oh yeah they're all over tampa or land on the wind i think a lot of the good stuff doesn't come to southward they understand you know they don't want to participate in all the bad taste but hearty's is good and i live there's shroom burger net stuff and whatever but then biscuit and gravy stuff and that ain't for me that is strictly for red necks no brother i don't mind a little biscuits and butter oh you know the biscuits i'm talking about the real mealy ones you know they're like oh another worst the only thing worse than mealy muffins is a mealy mouth i like me and i saw biscuit i mean all you i've been biscuits and gravy i like you and i saw fun right love it i'm gonna aid folks on the pool i do love you though just keep that in mind how how did that all start i have no idea i just it was kind of fun well i was i think when you were still doing the show you know yes i was trying to differentiate i friend of point out to you that i like you a lot you're a good guy but i don't love you i mean you know like i'll say i love Hank you know i love Hank is a friend you know i'm almost saying they're right no you love you know precisely what i'm talking about you can't love everybody deeply and affectionately and carry you know you follow i'm talking about i know exactly we're talking about you're the one that started all of this that's right i'm gonna get me at any trouble okay i'm just finally getting my life foot back together and i'm just you're starting with his lovecraft okay i don't love anybody how's that i don't love anybody i don't love me just just just put up with me that's all don't love me like my father used to say there's no such thing is love it's just a word i'd that's a and you wonder why i'm as cold as ice stone that's the kind of environment i grew up and i will do that show about my child her one day on air fact that Josh is lucky maybe he'll be in there on that day you won't even believe it how do you like that little sit in how do you like that line from a parent there and he said it on several occasions there's no such thing as love it's just a word that was my father my dad and that touching no cold as the Arctic i'd a you best dude are you ready for some football then tune in to ESPN gay and he hits the whole right after just he opens it up oh yeah ESPN gay i think that's a cowboy bears biking backers you'll get them all on ESPN gay he's gonna fire into his guy right here he'll just sweat you push you push your foot snow the passion just load him backwards you put your right under the back this ain't some makeovers show on Bravo it's the NFL on ESPN gay and then everyone's kind of sloping around down there and grunt the groan and you know you get mud stuff flying and that's what the fly fire ESPN gay where there's never a wardrobe malfunction I don't know where that one came from some days will never be the same and would like it it would be the last shot out of the Roman temple call your cable operator now and demand the ESPN gay for the people who have been a lot more for the bill guys are a lot good ESPN gay now that's a lot more it's a game club you more of course in about it i mean just the concept of guys taking showers naked together in the first place forget about what their sexual dittling is yeah just the concept of that seems awfully gay to me I could be wrong about that no you're you're right i mean just just on the base on the end addition to which he's looking at me and what the only the only reason I think that anybody would be upset about that is maybe we're like extraordinarily under-and-dowed i mean that would be embarrassing you know but other than that who cares so what if they are looking at you well what why are you threatened by that you know was that's the operative word was five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixteen they Verizon cigarette or wireless line but you know above and beyond all the hardaway business that thing this morning it's just a just got me if you two didn't late i'm listening to kinyin bobe for our show this morning Georgia courses out six today or at least with his families also and that he's not here today so he didn't come in and i get chances listen to about an hour their show or whatever was and the guy calls in and go and and again this is coming out now because of the hardaway thing yesterday and so the amichi comments are right on target all this did is open up an avenue for people to unleash their hostility in their intolerance in their hate and the guy tells about how we took his family including his kid didn't tell us say how many kids he had or how old they were to mention that probably about eighteen who knows but um to Disney last summer and it happened to be it was during the uh what are they don't call it gay days anymore they call it something whatever pride day is that it i i'm guessing i don't apply day or pride day frameless pride day and uh they're walking around through Disney and uh all of the suddenly sees two guys holding hands and there's another guy with his arm right another guy and his kid is there with me feel so uncomfortable about this and why didn't they tell him and warn him and all my god and that was the conversation of course uh you know kinyin bobe say oh yeah well they should have told you and they should have you know you shouldn't know if you're offended by this look if you're offended by anything don't leave the house that's my best suggestion just like the guy that call before who's a black and he's got the white life or whatever he was talking about uh if you're offended by multi racial couples don't leave the house if you're offended by guys who are a feminine walk swishy don't leave the house if you're offended by a people who's smell bad or maybe dress real sloppy like me don't leave the house that's my suggestion for it part of living is a being offended and as you live and become more tolerant more intelligent more understanding and have more experiences you become less offended because you realize that ain't no thing it's nothing why do you care if there are two guys walking down the street holding their hands and I realized that I you know often till I don't know how many years ago but I travel a lot through Europe you see that all over you're very commonly but it's all started seeing it more often I felt a little like queezy even though I'm a corset like that you know hmm what well yeah I mean because it's it's it's something you had didn't see don't you understand oh I understand so it makes you feel like oh gee of what's that all about people are going to be looking at that because you you feel the negativity coming being directed at you because of what they're doing it it's like my feelings about the pride parades many of it's embarrassing to me because I don't want to be lumped in with that that's not who or what I am I know about that which I'm not condemning those people they can dress it up and have all they're just having fun that's all and you're up but they're creating a really bad stereotype just like the media does whether it was Paul and the Charles Nelson Riley almost every gay person I'm telling is nothing until this very few short years ago was some missing flaming wild queen and that's what gay was all about just and just like the black son tell it's same thing in movies saw the step in fetcher routine yes I missed a bandie yes I missed you know that kind of crap of course it's his spanics it's always you're a poncho and whatever that kind of garbage you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying well what do you know about mine already same anyway either one of you what do you mean well what mine already are you a part of non-really yeah and Chris well we are kind of starting to come in my Nordian big county that's true yeah Chris is them already in 10,000 they can I know a couple people in the county this speaking ways multilingual and multitowned WQAM hello 2AM listen to that I love that I guess they got the tapes going air maybe they got their own studio set up who was what that was all about WQAM hello well keep wearing it and you can do it WQAM hello deal yes sir I'll listen to share something with you I'm my friend number 344 yes and just one of the say I used to work for the county as medical examiner used to work for the time seeing sex and to give you some insight on Dr. Perfer there he's a very hermit crabdish man phasing his office all day and it comes out and if you if you had half your head missing you'd probably not go out very much either true true he has basically has no life and the only comes out and does maybe you want to do a few cases a week and then you only come down to the high profile stuff too so very strange character very quiet here never never heard of fly though no step from table my Tony Perkins in psycho right exactly he has a whole new American site you know has a whole other side so okay well thanks for the insight pali whatever that means now wait to hear that somebody just passed this to us this is pathetic this is tragic oh no viewers of the 700 club will have the pleasure of the company of sports superstar Tim Hardaway the superstar was contacted by Pat Robertson on Friday today and a show of support for his comments on the evils of homosexuality and Hardaway agreed to be against on the 700 club so all this business about apologizing and sucking up and trying to cover up all his business contacts and his deals evidently that he forgot about that overnight in other recent in other news a recent reports has children between 12 and 17 of the most frequent viewers of internet pornography and the average age of first time exposure to internet porn is just 11 years old the state of Virginia is taking new steps to protect your kids from online predators and Virginia is attorney general Bob Macdonald is leading the charge and this is on the cvn the Christian broadcasting network website Tim Hardaway will be on the 700 club with Pat Robertson and other you know birds of a feather we're crazy together how do you like that what does that tell you so all this business about how he was apologetic and but it would be for about I mean how could where could he find a more open venue to outlet his hostility homophobia and with Pat Robertson and with these farbizs in the going where else could he go no where sounds like a winner yeah sounds like he's so he's got a whole new niche come maybe he's going to run for office unlike that on the homophobic ticket the eight ticket I sure want to be alerted to win the hallowed comes on the seven heart club but he's going to be really good and any can talk about taking showers with all him in fact it's an all them staring at his goods and stuff like that first of all Tim your ugliest sin number one and who that wants to see what you got anyway ugly as sin oh rafat not like that too see one of the things about the NBA is most of the guys but most seven foot tall people are freaks am i right well yeah you know i'm saying there freaks of nature i mean the nature doesn't make too many seven foot tall people and so as a result they tend to look very disproportionate and their features are very uh and they're generally extraordinarily ugly people well they're a little goofy i'm not talking about their behavior i'm just talking about what they look like it's not like there's a hot lot of hot NBA basketball players they generally tend to be extraordinarily usually is what i'm telling you so the idea that there's a bunch of sex pots running around and every flag is went to the NBA i mean what what does that mean it's like if i go to a hockey game and there's plenty i mean there's lots of real hot looking hockey players there's that dangerous that i'm sitting there looking at them i'm not going in the shower with them even my old buddy ray witteny lever let me go in the shower with him and boy i should would like to but that's beside the point and he wasn't terrified i mean it's a matter of fact you know the interesting thing about guys who are comfortable with their sexuality they find it amusing they don't care they're they're not uptight about it it's like guys i joke with online here on this stuff and make all kinds of wise cracks and jokes they know they know what it's all about they know it's just uh kid and around and they're not threatened by it if you know what you are and you're all about you're not threatened if you're insecure about you're all new what's at all then you've got real problems then you're the one who needs serious health four shredio five sixty play like man and they look like women hey man hey who's this it's a Jeff hey i was in your restaurant and it's well like up dog what is up dog i don't

hate together five six seven oh five sixty and pong five sixty and he verizon singular wireless line 30 q a m hello yes oh i just wanted to uh am i a little sounds like you yeah how are you gonna retort him uh let's talk to you to want to make a couple comments about the old vista hardaway yeah we my kids went to send schools who's better and he is by far him and it's why two of the most ignorant people you've ever met in your life you know hey good we have a grammar badly but uh that was when i wanted to laugh at was the uh the latest apology that came out if you if you read it i mean it sounds like it was crafted by you know a hardwood educated author right well he's a little bit like his agent wrote a you know that oh i mean they need to determine that downer but if you ever see him on tv as as a as a firstcaster you know they should dumb that downed about third grade blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah well he's hitting his gate peoples you know so it's so one of them things thanks hi yeah what is a retort me on my love you thanks paly okay so let me read he ain't too bright he ain't the brightest bulb in the pack is whether guys trying to say is if we uh yeah figure that out eleven forty nine on a full will make twelve hundred easy in fact if Joshua really gotten back into his old form we could have probably made thirteen today if you really pushed it heavy duty but you know what we don't care anymore okay since you're not too honest show anymore we just you know we don't to do those things press of course being uh heavy duty as he is especially the heavy part he just isn't the energy to get on the air out come on let's get that you know like you used to do not it doesn't make any difference we got uh what i say twelve hundred and one my space friends all right now the bad news is that uh jury the uh it would be in guide did not remove himself from there maybe i'll just remove him myself jury because you're a jackass and he writes this pseudo intellectual response about well if i'm worried about things like uh get lost okay it's just for fun that's all just for a little bit of fun and uh whatever some of these people were there uh i just i can't deal with people like that like the ones of calling tell me how to do the show and don't read the new stories and don't do this i'm doing okay so far for a dot-ing old fart how do you like that i go to the bank twice a month on the ten ten twenty-five and believe you me just like i did this morning on the throne i make a very ample deposit okay a very healthy deposit trust me when i tell you not missing any meals all i probably shouldn't miss some meals get done about one seventy boy you'll be proud of me i'll be dangerous but i get down to one seventy i look to like Brady Quinn i jack was telling me before the show today a Brady Quinn is a real stud is what he said i didn't say that but you did see him where i saw him at the uh well i was at radio row all week of the uh the week before the Super Bowl yeah we're doing all of the shows then we end with you know we seem like naked or something or not now he's in you know like a deal to meet you coming there and like take a shower with him or watch him take a shower no i'm just kidding no he did not bring him to not say don't don't even start something like that show dad they had some joke and light of what's going on yeah and light of what's going on the less said the better believe me Brady Quinn did not say he's a good Catholic boy from Notre Dame and he loves everybody i'm sure that and i love him mmm i love him i mean in a more personal and very up close in fact let me go back to our home page every sort of fly under our home page any more because i'm always on our private page i got all kinds of private pages just like Mark fully had private pages and ever had that kind of we got shave everywhere on there we had that story right under the pool we got a link to that shave everywhere and then under interestingly enough do you think it's just by accident right under that thing where it says son of a saying execution video and he'll elfing himself it's got the Brady Quinn picture where he's on the phone you know and the some other guys there and i let's see is the other guy holding the football yeah i wonder if the other guys like almost as naked as Brady's in that picture oh i wonder what that means maybe they just came out of a shower together but anyway Brady got a call he's on the phone and he's standing in his blue walking shorts and i thought oh in fact the just like the kids today he's got the shorts down like not as low as the kids today yeah sorry that was nice that where their shorts are not their pants down to their ankles you think that when i grew up we were pantalones down around our ankles like a bunch of gangsters now that wasn't the style no so in other words i'm dating myself because saying like the pumps today were that's the way they do man i know in fact you walk away into the mall and you see them all walking around like that you think their pants are going to drop by on a floor in a second you think yeah sure hope so well some of them some of you hope so but anyway there's Brady and talk about shaving everywhere i mean he is you should ask them that i mean you get to speak to him or anything they didn't let you anywhere near like i said we were going to try to get uh i was going to try to pull off a drop for you if i could you know maybe like a nice 12-to-one hour that would have been lovely but yeah his aunt arrived was pretty i had him well protected man they had him guarded they had his body protected because i guarantee you there are a lot of people that want him they want to clawed him and pawed him and do all kinds of god only those what kinds of things do i know i should do but anyway he's he is done the what were you guys trying to tell me about the uh waxy whatever he's done he's a normal co-deal he's he has shaved every uh here of course is far down as we can see because you do see his box of shorts and then you see the regular walking shorts he's gone on now those walking shirts or is that part of like a yeah this is just walking shorts not part of it like a us athletic thing like an athletic supporter you think he's wearing a jack strap underneath those box I have no idea well i mean it should be interesting to find out i'm sure the audience would be very interested great equipment could be the next often quarterback i mean i know he's no uh what what's your call that we had before that you had before excuse me that was a four-year-ins look well you name any of them all everybody since damn right name that's that now you're talking i was just gonna say that he's not even though David woodley i can't believe David woodley is that that's just it just bothers me tremendously how old was he when he died he was he on guy yeah then he got like some kind of uh jaundice or something in a skin turn yellow and uh he died very young guy David woodley he was a good looking guy not a great quarterback now we're didn't he playing one super bowl David woodley yes he did which one was that 84 83 maybe 84 right right right see i know just like that guy said before how can you be a queer and you go on you know almost yeah what's how do you do that i don't know you know it's the same magic one that used to pull up those uh godfather clips thank you all see that's not worse like that so anyway i got back on here i have it looked at these pictures in a long time Brady Quinn there's the one below which quite frankly is a little bit he looks too ripped in that that other one man that's it that's just too much for me too much to handle so to speak but the upper one where he's on the phone looking very innocent and i don't know why you say he's uh ugly guy i mean i don't know oh stop no don't start when i look i would have thought that he's uh he's like i'm honestly there no you they you know made a little bit of a comment honestly i think he's yes i think he's on a road it's the guy's a monster i mean i'm not talking about how big he is he's six four he's obviously very well developed he's worked out a lot he's been working it out i'm sure he can be and and who's he working that with anybody he wants believe me but i'm not talking about that you saw him close in personal was he a good looking guy or is he like a retard looking uh honest answer now come on i don't know what to tell you i i we've had this conversation son of the was even after all this passage of time two years on this show and then a little bit of reprieve to clear your mind and you still don't have the ability to pass judgment i whether or not some guy a very famous guy a famous uh hot built great athletic i can tell he's a very built like he's a big guy is a these built i don't know if he ever saw his yeah some hardaways a big guy so what does that mean see a hot looking guy teamy hardaways a big guy team hardaway like like like he's like my size it's a basketball player yeah but hardaways probably five hardaways like five ten dude i'm five like i said is a big guy yeah i'd say so okay see i don't know from him hardaways but he looks like in order to like he's four dollars too sports and the NBA are incompatible one has nothing to do with the other okay give me the ball give me the ball is that a bunch of seven foot guys now he would be an exception because like you said if he's only five ten how many others shrinks are any league like that most guys are like six ten six eleven seven one right yeah but and so they got the the basket is ten feet from the floor so the guy the idea of a seven foot tall guy being able to jump enough to slime a jammer to above ball in the basket it to me is not great athletic talent it's not a big deal you know how do you know that you're gay i'm not that's right i forget about that like i said i haven't got any idea what it's all about i'm the biggest thing i've got the best talent in the class i know rock sports video five sixty you may them we got the route and when i'm up in bulk of taga slapping all women with painted lips around the pole i listen to the new Rogers one to two of them yeah i mean i listen to the new Rogers Aaron balance one to two hours whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa their hot their sexy their musk and their own national tour their the shipping bills and their day i come up with one my ad oh sad that you come over here and greet me apple i hate what we mean oh we're chicky feeling their the shipping bills and their day it's uh uh one or what is it twelve fifty nine or it's almost one o'clock it's close enough i must take in the break a little bit early a little premature evaluation it was that one of the ones that had the lives five by somebody who's on the area five or clock in the morning on the lock no i guess you want to let's just start with this christian it does the log it's the new traffic on what's his story is he like boom like that a little bit i wasn't he the guy that you were in thought you had his office Josh no no you're talking about the copyrighter christ what's been right he's gone he didn't work here anymore yeah this other one is christian christian is the oh christian i sure hope so there's nothing worth an abad christian we'll get him on the 700 club yeah with Pat Robertson and Tim Hardaway who's not very tall i thought Tim Hardaway being an NBA player would be a big guy and i never really put any attention i've seen i've seen his pussy in the articles now he's a senior we face it all yeah you little seem oh maybe that's why he's just jealous now i'm beginning to understand it because you can only imagine those six eleven and seven foot guys in the showers naked and this guy i guess i guarantee he don't measure up oh oh now now i'm starting to put the pieces of this all together i sounds like jealousy to me oh breaking news on CNN and i'm done with the and the cole Smith trauma this afternoon uh-oh from the release of the will what's in it and who is the executor what's going to be a real slow-end cool-year sim hardy-ill hate message to gaze yes you're will you're will gonna be on CNN breaking news oh yeah i'm living that class house i've cheated 10 million times and i'll admit it straight up dude uh i've done it 10 million times live the pay for it and live the walk away from it so uh we've all been there so much for cheaters never win what if it ends think about the nascar scandal i couldn't care less about the nascar scandal or an in the cool or uh whatever that but the hardaway thing i care a little bit about not not a whole lot but it makes for good radio which do you bathe with that's our pool we got 1175 will easily make the others handle the cool when she was alive looking pretty skanky there oh you know i can be a good who's named in the and on a cold Smith world we can't wait we can speculate yes we'll find out today oh i did that now there's another reason to keep living okay is that sometime today we'll find out who's named and the cold is a will and something oh there's my friend Susan candy out he is so sweet she's such a nice person i keep saying that because a lot of you people think i don't like anybody which isn't true but i like Susan a lot you're in pro bait as they say she is she's a great great lady which do you bathe with 1175 will do 1200 easy because Josh is working with us today because George is out with the sick family nursing everybody now now let's be kind of taking a day off let me ask you this i originally was gonna take off today and then of course i changed my plans because i'm not going anywhere this weekend but uh monday is a holiday kind of make believe holiday now is that are we are holiday to people it's present today right yes yeah this Monday for born 19 so a lot of people have a three-day weekend and some people are going away for a long weekend which more power two haven't had a great time instead of in so on and i don't know while i mean we're working correct and people yeah the people in the building had an option um they could have even either you know not showed up the last holiday whatever it was it was on a monday and well okay aren't loser kingdom that's it and uh but i i didn't come to work that day so i'll be here monday and i'll be here monday in this chair pooping my pants and crystal be there in his chair on monday i'm rich at George will be back on monday we hope yeah well Chris doesn't get holidays and i noticed that uh Kenny and bow are gonna be on monday more they're gonna be busy on the 700 club with uh Tim Hireway i'm sure and gellie is gonna be oh but like i said i'm thinking about that they've been a holiday you know oh see i don't technically what the deal is because i you know me i don't like six days and i don't like um that whole deal in fact this week this whole week i could have taken one or two six days when i was choking in gagging and puking and not to pat myself on the back but i'll do an anyway right in this spot here where it feels pretty good i just did don't like doing that i like a show and up you know what the Bruce B.s. says i believe in an honest days work for an honest days pay and i have to put an awful lot of days work for the kind of money they're paying me so i'll show which you made with on the mail i use soap 584 it is a down under 50 percent 49.7 as the end of the course myth here in drags into the third day and she started to smell really skanking out worse than usual nasty whoo can you imagine no like i told George that that scene in silence at lands where they got the dead body and he's putting the uh the whatever that stuff as he said it was a mix which is very amusing but they have stuff that they put in their nose to cover up the smell so it doesn't like burn their lining of your nose because because of the nasty rank of the composing body the carcass anyway soap 584 49.7 percent body wash guys 402 34.2 percent so you guys are very slow okay i i i i i obviously a cultural thing a phobia kind of thing believe me get you a sponge or a lupa or a wash cloth and a bottle of real manly body wash you'll never go back to soap again real manly like one of those uh maybe even old spice uh people that use old spice man something wrong with them i saw the bat 74 female uses body wash 50 i hate this 435 only 2.9 percent unlike yesterday when they hated it they hated that pull and Josh is not too happy that we're doing this again by the way because he's he's been there and done this before and female uses soap as god but third man so the females 50 to 30 for the body wash for the guys almost 50 percent to 34 percent still with the soap go to show you guys are very insecure oh you're you're in the shower uh staring at the and and so what about it big deal 560 050 550 in fact i'd let me another put you this way if i ever thought which i never have because i never looked uh all my good but if i ever thought that i look good enough for people to stare at me because i was a sex object i'd be pretty pleased about that wouldn't you by anybody i mean i wouldn't care who it was i would care for like animals i mean uh staring me like oh look at that mm mm you know if mark fully was like i'm going like that i think well that's pretty you're pretty desperate mark but nevertheless you see what i'm saying there's nothing wrong with lusting after somebody what the hell difference is a make what why are you so uptight to me what is it that you're not telling us about okay wouldn't be surprised if him and and pad robbers and do it right on the air wouldn't surprise me talk about the world can even mount his man god only knows what's going to be happening talk about do you house you're doing a do you style what can only begin to imagine what's going to happen on the 700 club wk m hello yes sir happy Friday to you back to you listen uh bottom of this is too crude or gross to talk about but i'm not but it's but it's not it or i just shows what are you going to do um i was heard about the the smell of a dead body and i never it was exposed to it until i moved to the disappointment the guy before me had hung himself oh nice have you ever had was hung exactly and have you ever owned a house and fertilize the grass with that granulated like six six six fertilizer or sure yeah the antichrist fertilizer right and then and then watered it it's that little weed yeah it's like and it's the strangest and that's why people say you know it's a smell that um that they never forget anyway that's what let me uh must be like miss the cold is uh yeah she and she and smel knew good right now you're into that all right happy Friday and back to you pali okay well got before he had moved in there was hung love an hour and eighty on a full eleven eighty keeps coming up whtama Rochester let me tell you the story again about the bob turner in those hockey tickets oh not to that's not a part of the problem growing old is like like when i go to my mother for lunch every week every two days she would start out by telling me the same thing she had told me the week before i mean you know not that she was seen out or anything like that or if she was it was like for the last thirty years of her life because it was always the same that never changed i was a constant it was a given and i'd say you already told me that last week and oh did i imagine then she go on and come you know keep going and tell me the same thing i'll over it and that's i think what i'm doing although the with us i think we have like maybe a little bit of a shifting audience with the tremendous promotion we get here on the two a.m. you know we have all these new people coming aboard that haven't heard all my nifty stories about you know proving in my pants and stuff like that am i right oh yeah you you've heard them all and i've heard of yeah you've heard them all well just make up some new ones how's that okay deal w q a and hello hello yes this new rod yes sir you know i i spoke with you last time about 10 years ago wow and i also came to your home well there's that weather guy there's that uh akiga you came to my home yes i did for what we talked on your food day well my buddy wasn't installing your food here or no few remember oh yeah yeah i remember you but i remember this weather guy here the akira and see it holy so he is cute go ahead okay yeah by the way uh posty tunnel and so rental in Italy are wonderful places you should know and so on yeah the i'm not because just google it and you'll see you could rent up the live i've been there many times it's just incredible i'm on my way right now as a matter of fact since the mail i'm infected i can take off Monday for this big holiday maybe i do it but but pride in the on the uh and the other places like those both even places uh i don't like them they did something the architecture is all the same i really don't like it really yeah i had a friend that went to prog last summer here uh i think with some returning said it was beautiful i said it was like like an outdoor museum all the beautiful buildings and all the historic stuff he thought it was pretty nifty yeah but you know if you close you guys you could be a unit you could be in a lot of places i look all the same you know what that reminds me of it's like the people i go in these museums and or i'll tell you better example is in Vegas you know see all these new and i've been in most of my you know the finishen and yeah parrots and all the other and uh bologna but and on the outside of course they're all very different but when you go inside most of them yeah no matter how beautifully on the outside and how unique they may be outside when you go inside they all look the same they all look those in their slots and you know they're pretty much like the same yeah well there's a new where just to talk about these people this homophobic over here when you go to a side of France like at the door you go to Italy you know you go to the beach all the girls are topless nobody attacks them like the guy said well will you look right i mean people are civilized i mean i used to watch commercials with my mom and Italy a block commercial and you see the girls boobies yeah oh yeah sure i knew the on TV and you're all over the place here it's like because americans are so sexually repressed they like to pretend that they're really hip and cool and with it and what sexually they're like in a stone age yes sir my talking to you buddy back to you yeah yeah so then though in fact my close personal friend was in cement or told me in this travel i'll get some information about that sound like one of many places i need to be in fact you know something i wish i was back in Berlin right now now that i'm over this cool i wish i was you know feeling really sprying was like you know it was like the middle of made would be nice and i was back in Berlin right now having me a wild gay time and then there's a place for you in fact before i hitler back in the in nineteen twenties uh Berlin was the gay capital of europe i'm sorry germ and jr me was that about your pardon he said that's a place for you for me oh okay there you go oh you like it there too you would love it there well what's not to like you have so that the food is great and the people are beautiful and uh they're very broad minded no puny minded and there's lots to see and lots of us stuff i mean all depends and obviously you would take your Russian girlfriend if you went when George sends you on your trip yeah see it's really sad you know if it's unfortunate that you know there are a few of us that have all the money and then you yeah i can i can afford to travel like you know in the US i understand but that you can afford to travel maybe to the Palm Beach County line on a good day that's it well i'm sorry about that even though i do love you i'm not sending you on a trip okay no not not one no maybe you do uh Tampa maybe to burn steakhouse in Tampa I've been here let take care of that uh I've been there yeah it's good i told you the story about burn laxard the owner who since died and the reason he died is because he you know he when i was on the year all those years raving about because i was doing you and baseball we'd go over to Tampa and always go to burn steakhouse at least once during the road trip usually twice and uh you got them tons of business man i would come back on here and rave about it you know and all every time anybody from south Florida went up there who was a listener mine and was in Tampa they go to burn steakhouse and they would say all the new riders told me about your place and burn laxard the owner was very uh you're nice to me and one time i was there with a friend and he said oh my goodness i just want to give you the tour of the place and but it would be but it would put around he took me down the kitchen around her and he said to me he said you abruptly so much business you can't even believe everybody from south Florida that comes in here is a listener your show he said but i'm not one of those people who believes and trying to repay uh kindness with in other words he wasn't going to pick up the tap not not that I cared but it was just such a cheap ass thing to do you know what I'm saying oh i agree i'm not i'm not one of those people tries to repay kindness by by picking up your tab which i just thought was i mean why even bring it up you know yeah why bring that up burn well he said no anyway because god punished him for not picking up my tab shame on you eleven ninety six on our pool and the body wash forty nine points six percent now for so but it's coming down in fact the guys right now is the listing they're reaching out for the body wash maybe something really marcho well let's look on my besides the deetus what's the other ones acts and our acts as in tim hardway would say let me act you what you're using the biggest name so best and we're reporting this is the record sports radio 560 but we're not doing on two a yeah we're not back and back on again come on once they had before these are my kind of guy when the elevator do we're that any way if a manly sounded dying really games i want more Chris Moore bus boys real high yeah when I listen to this board a manly voice won't get my attention i will really get me said for this yard let's bring you high boys we'll get the other action so i hate what we do without you a yeah look that dragon back on again i'm going to miss here it's great then we've pushed this eye super now i'll have to get deeper is that closet again so i'm gonna press all the macho friends and send out for it's more and I'd give it a hand to the side yeah they're ain't done on my camera macho sports guys and boys has had some practice they were well here you'll sit at candle like that yeah stand up real close to the radio and sound if they're watching down of their really bigs my phone stay okay and that's real man we have he started in my infractor from oh two on a pull we got our 1200 we can just relax now take a deep breath that was the second thing i played in qaim on our first day on the air that was the second but i played you wonder what the first one was what good my eye oh the the memories are all that's left devastation that once had been and for a and that was quite a play are you sure contact him or insane to blow it all in when they build those condos and block that power off you'll be lower down into your grave and you were great at one time but now you sound more like a signal drifting in the wind and you'll never see numbers you can sail again boo yeah click channel those what they're doing but so they think but no it's less than the anymore because they really steal this eye oh the let go a Gregor just the proof of the rest of that retardity that remains a tax and soul regime their title has a scheme huh but it's clear to see that despite all their court for it in bigs they can hide the fact without feeling like a crappy deal absolutely and you are great at one time but now you sound more like a signal drifting in the wind and you'll never see numbers you can sail again no get near channel those what they're doing but so they think that no one's listening anymore because they really all right wing is not checking wings but all right wings you can eat it's uh I wonder if they're gay people are buying chicken wings from uh to me hardaway hey tell me I hear he's just a team is what I'm here see you don't even have to say it yourself we got it in the uh friend yeah it's beautiful thing it's something that the jacks left is when they'll let me just say this to you since we're into this whole home of phobia thing and people are so scared or what can each other and guys are holding hands it doesn't mean we're all I mean it's just to me it's so childish it's a I'd be embarrassed to actually call and then have somebody hear my voice recognize my voice and say such swivel on the air because people would think I'm such an insecure put such a moron such a bad parent by the way such a schmuck for example now I haven't been down there in what many months I don't know when the last time I did a show from there which isn't going to happen again but how long would you say that was oh it's a show you did I'll got probably at least I'd say a year and a half really probably so then over time I haven't seen you in a year and a half okay right all right now as you know when it because there were long interludes in the every now and then I'd come back and do a show and like George and I would see each other for the first time in a month and George and I worked together for 16 years and we give each other a hug in the idea and like that you know so if I came down there tomorrow swimming we were on the air tomorrow and I saw you and I and we greeted each other and I gave you a hug right would you would you that make you up tight? no no I see it is that like gay a sexual thing or what? no god no so the fact that there were like guys at Disney what walking around a guy with his arm around another guy what what does that mean? well why is why is it that frightened to people? it's frightening to me that there are people who think that way that's terrifying to me talk about terrorism that is terrifying to me that in 2007 in America and a supposedly enlightened country but then again look at your president you know but look like that good point yeah maybe he was afraid he might enjoy seeing the guys doing that yeah maybe he might maybe daddy might get aroused and the kids will say hey gee daddy are you just happy to see us or is that you know like that all deal for you said WQAM hello Nail M yes sir what's up man how you doing pali? oh not too bad went to Disney World a couple years back it was a home process to their man's best time I've been to Disney World very few people no kids running around great guys on the hands and stuff but it wasn't bad for them okay thanks yeah probably it's probably slim pickins when they announce ahead of time and they do of course if you check the if you're that up tight about stuff check the counter go online and check Disney and Nail tell you when they're having whatever it is you know 129 votes on the poll on the body wash deal 49.2 percent while we might actually get under how 49 percent that would be quite a feather in you're ass wouldn't okay x8 says right I got a whole bunch of it stuff here and I'm not getting to it because I'll grab the you know I like the rambling kind of deal here you know especially with you there today if George likes me reading the stories but you could bring up tight cousin and girl told you to no the thing with Josh is he doesn't care he'll go with a flose as long as the time flies by fast and he gets the free food that's all he cares about how to get the free food well that's good and then of course as you some of you will recall sometimes a little bit too much free food and as the result there be these long interludes where George would say oh he's not in there now he's in here how have you been hiding today yeah I timed a pretty good today really yeah yeah I mean I told you before you got to admit nobody in the world knows how to do that better than me I'll give it to you I don't know how you do it man there have been times when nature was calling and during a commercial break I was back with still like a minute to spare and everybody would say how do you do that it must you know was no fossil our man I guess a lot of experience controversy over a possible misuse opportunity for a rock pro shaman with a ran I love that rock pro shaman all those friends were stupid I'll grew this week is a former a-to-cue secretary stayed condemn Lisa of misleading Congress on the issue flip lever who worked on the I think I had this story yesterday but this is like a little more on it who worked on the national security council when it was headed by condemn Lisa said he proposal vetted by two miles of senior leaders was sent to the US to make 2003 and was a kid of the 72 US opening to China speaking at a conference on capital hill lever said he was confident it was seen by a rise and then secretary stayed cold and piled but the administration rejected the overture rights to spokesman denied to misled Congress reiterated that she didn't see the proposal liar liar your pantalini's are on fire by the way get the gap in your teeth fixed you nasty nasty hostile bitch she is really she's vile over that end of the course well as 18 to 19 pages long of course as you know he died of an overdose in September just a few days after his infant sister his sister was born and this does tell you in a little bit of detail that all of the way to the past should be held in a trust by Howard case sir or any of her minor or minors until the age of 21 and then a third of it was supposed to go to them a third of it more at age 25 and at age 30 some of the monies would be split up an like that the son died and that he would if he would have just stuck around nothing doing all them drugs and life it let her you just know it would have been love in life he had a bit lot of life he didn't hear it had millions so wasn't bad enough that he died he was like 20 years older something like that whatever the hell he was I think was 20 yeah but then he missed out on all like cash he could have had him one wild all time maybe get old time not necessarily in the most literal way I can't wait for the 700 club with Pat Robertson and Tim Hardaway with the real bigots please both stand up you You shine like you're crying. I'm thinking that by aliens. You've been kidnapped again. By aliens. You've been kidnapped by aliens. Where did they dump Tuck you? I'm a turkey. Albuquerque. That in America. Where? In New Mexico. Where? New Mexico. Albuquerque. Yes. I was in Georgia. No, no Mexico. I don't believe you. But you don't have to lie to me. I want to get married. I really do. I was kidnapped by aliens. I'm not a lab. I've got your hair. They get your hair. They get your hair. Who does? The aliens. That's your hair. You say your hair. You mean like, run and see. Pressure. Oh, long as a mess. The longer like, Bobbiol. I'm not doing the bigots. You're right. They don't get a lab. I believe you. Bobbiol, you moron. You cannot pick you up. I've got a seven-eleven. Seven-eleven? Yes. Can you get me a slorpie? What? Slorpie. What? A slorpie? A slorpie? What? Like a blue bird or a wolf? I just think I'm not. I think it's you who slorpie. All right. I'll get a myself.

Anyway. I played that because Chris, before the show this morning, said he just has never that many very long time. And he loves it. Or have I? So. I really really. I can never play that too much. And also, and until he enjoyed the basement, I have to play that too. That's classic. It is a classic. It's a big good way to end the weekend. Like right now, it'd be good. 26-2-2. This business is some people getting off on Monday. I'm not too pleased about that. Although, see, I'm not big on holidays where there's no commerce involved. You know, although they do have President-Stay sales all over don't they? Yes, I guess so. Oh, sure. You see those in the papers, big ads. President-Stay, St. All at Cardi Leruz and furniture joints, stuff like that. But for us, you know, every day is just another day in Paradise. Sign and speak of that. And for the life of me, I have no idea. I, I, I totally, I lived on a hundred and twenty first have implantation when they were building the saw grass years ago. Right. And from my backyard, I could see the progress. You know, I, basically, watched them build the saw grass. There was nothing there at that time. In fact, well, I'll find me in West Broward, there are any acres. Well, I first moved out there, which would be like, Oh, I don't know. Like, six, about twenty years ago. There was nothing there. There was that Ray Calmillgo, which I still, to this day don't have any idea what that place is, what, what, that business is, do you know what it is? No. Some kind of a office building. And that was there. And not much else. And it was not that was the best fire wasn't there. All the strict shopping centers where people give killed when they try to pull out because there's no traffic lights. When you people in Broward in plantation that are finding it smart and put that extra traffic light in your idiots between one 18th. And there were with the next one is, you know, jobs. Now, you know where I'm talking about, where best buy is? Yeah, it's a nightmare. Anybody that tries to pull out of the sunrise bullet guard from there and make a left turn is take me to their life in their hands. There needs to be a life there. I've been screaming that I found out there were people killed there. Maybe that's what they want to do is reduce the population. Give a little crowded out there out west. Simon property group donations, largest mall operator, said a data partner with Ferrellon capital management to buy the mills corporation for $1.64 billion. And you're wondering, who the hell is the mills corporation? Who that is? They own the saw grass mills. That's where they came from. So you got it mills. Nothing mills brothers, not healing mills. Now is there like this other saw grass mills mall somewhere? I don't know that. Well, if you let me do the rest of the story, we'll find out. We'll probe this thing. We'll probe it just like they were doing the runway bride. They were probing her. And they couldn't find any intelligence. The acquisition of mills will be completed through a cash tender off of 25 at a quarter per share for all of St. E.S. Simon and mills each has a strong presence in South Florida. Simon owns the town center mall in Boca, Boiton Beach Mall, Palm Beach Mall and West Palm Beach, Crol Square and Crol Springs and Dadeland and my main financial malls. How do you like that? My main financial mall. Bill's a cherry-traced mural with own saw grass mills, the broad mall, West Land Mall and Haley and the falls in Miami. Most is agreed to terminate in the aisle. When I was living in Kendall, I always liked the falls. I thought that was a pretty neat shopping center. Am I right or am I wrong? I mean, that's 100 years ago. Chris? Yes. I don't like the falls? Yeah, I mean, actually, I've gotten used to it since the hurricane, but I almost kind of like a better pre-hurric hand-enter. Well, that's a long time ago. Well, do you remember what it looked like back then? I remember what anything looked like. I barely remember Dadeland. It had, there was a little bit less shops, but it had more of like the water area and there were fish swimming around and everything. Now it's just all shops and it had like this little mini, like, two-foot wide stream going through. I mean, it's not mad, but when I was there, I liked the falls 100 years ago. That's like saying when I was in Boston, I liked Prince Brigadier house. They won't even know the business for 100 years. Most is agreed to terminate in agreement to be sold a Brookfield asset management, Brookfield been whatever they've been. So that's the sawgrass being. And the reason I read that story is not because I really care about who owns it and probably most of you couldn't care. Let's see, what's the big sentence with it? I've mentioned this a million times and I still scratch my head and wonder why. I think it's just a commentary on how boring the set of footage generally is. It's the number two tourist attraction in the state behind Disney. I wonder if they have gay days at the sawgrass, though, because guys holding the hands. Because, you know, all the Latin American people at the sawgrass, no speaking English. I got key. All the people there don't speak English. That's how I just said. That's just Latin America. It's like a tourist attraction for the sawgrass. It's like an international place where nobody's speaking English. But I don't know what the attraction is there. I mean, there's all those outlets stores and, well, what is the, I don't know. What is the dealer? What's the big sentence? I don't know. By the way, I think that place would give a woodbinder run for their money for really smelly people. Really? Oh yeah. I see. I mean, I think what we're trying to say is all you foreigners, man, you better like butcher up a little bit and start using some aftershades and colon and a little doosier some body wash. A little bit of body wash would be good in the morning, okay? I guarantee I will guarantee you, I'll bet you're lying. I said it before I'll say it again, that people use body wash are certainly much cleaner and much more antiseptic and smell. And remember when I first was trying to talk you with a using it and you were, they were going to smell like flowers or, you know, select some kind of a pansy member there? I don't think that was the issue. That was an issue that you were saying such ludicrous things and I kept trying to tell you, you don't walk around with the smell of the body wash. Hopefully if you have any brains in your head after your smear to my mouth or your body, you wash it off in a shower. That's the idea with it. And you people are still using the soap. It's like taking a bath. Okay, I understand if you don't have a shower in your house, you have only a bathtub. That's unfortunate, you know? I mean, how many people don't have a shower anymore, right? Everybody do? There's actually people who have only baths and non-wavals. I don't know. I have no idea, but if that's the case, you can't knock them, do much, they got no choice. But anybody that would take a bath and sit in their own filth. You know, like I said, it went out with black and white television for Christ's six. It went out with knickers. It went out with a slinky, although I think slinky made it come back, didn't it? Yeah. Slinky is always popular. Not slinky's are fun. Although my problem is always with bend, the metal on them, I would always break them, you know. I was just a devil of a child. Let me tell you about my childhood, something. Okay. Some day when you really want to get depressed. The biggest name, so that's it. The biggest role in this world, right? Yes, it's a world, which is where you'll find sick of it. Okay, yeah, baby. And, no good. That's a looted. It's 30 a day plus gas. Well, I ran in Lincoln. Gash or credit, I drove up in the hill. You want me insurance? And recall how it happened, well it's been like it still gives me chid. And what a weirdo, followed my map of Star House as it was shot to see. Sitting on the front porch was Angelina Jones. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I walked up like a new hood. And I saw her as it takes. Okay. But the clothes on Star to work in them for her. It was too late. But her and my car and her. Roll the windows down. Now she works my queen and I made her cry. And I've got Angelina Jones in my basement. I've been the face of her. And I've been got keeper there with me. And charge her red hair. I've got him red. Well, I won't you go mine. I won't let you find that she likes the cement. I need your face back. Now I'll wander for life. There's with Angelina Jones in my basement. And I've been out here. Watch kids are free, men. For men, men. But I bet you've given your message. Help me. To have Angelina Jones in your basement. I'll wear a dress. So hurt my dog. I'll go and cut. Don't hurt pressure. I'll hurt your dog.

Yeah. Okay. I would imagine a punk like you with that hot girlfriend. You probably frequent some of those hot spots and stuff. Beach now in any of your entire county guy know. Not because it's not okay down there. It's just it's like really expensive. Yeah. I don't have a scyphalite. You can't afford to go to South Beach. But I would imagine with all the people down there. Especially the ones with the 80 pounds of jewelry around their neck. That it wouldn't be that uncommon to see two guys walking on this like you know, A1A on Colon excuse me, Collins Avenue, hand in hand. Are you kidding? They're all over the place. Well that's what I'm saying. So what's the big sentence about a lot of freaky carlos looking people out there? That's another good reason not to go to South Beach. Yes it is. Judges ordered stern to appear at Tuesday's hearings about an enclosed body. The interest. No. Maybe even Howard Stern from the radio. Howard let's get serious. We'll be there. Boy, does she look like a cow in that picture or what man? That's not it. She was like, she was all over the place. She ultimately looked good. Marginal and just wrote Tessk and an accol. By guarantee you she ain't looking too good right now. The judge says he owns the body by the way. But they are going to finally. They're going to like, uh, format of what they call it, and vomit.

Most of, uh, wasn't as good as the terrorist and, uh, you know, the guys that are born terrorists and also they're the gay terrorists. The ones that really be very concerned about.

So, he's one of the race on Sunday. Once he got a message to Joe Z. Uh huh. Likely story, schmuck. 560, 505, 60, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, but rise in singular and wireless line. WQAM hello. QAM. Yeah.

He's doing the guy from Lute's thing and the other guys doing somebody else. I'll stuff that we've had on before. The bridge tender and then one that you thought was relatively amusing. I'm sorry. Did you think that they were going to come up with their own material? No. But then they, but they do it so poorly. And I'm saying bridge tender junior chronic from Lute's junior, all these very sad tragic people. It's just not to make me want to kiss the ground. I'm going to go outside to a clock. I'm going to kiss the street. Kiss the sidewalk. Kiss this. Son of a shine and sure if they've called us hell, but who cares? In fact, let's take a look right now. So cast an oval Monday morning. Can tell everybody what the temperature wasn't to run on Friday. I'm going to your Roger show. Minus six. I don't know what that is. It's maybe twenty-seven. Ninus six. It's warm up a little bit now. We got a heat wave. It's in the twenties now. And so we had the other day, the four or five inches snow, whatever was supposed to be. It's mostly gone right now. It's vanishing. So come on up. Come on down. WDQAM. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. Can you go in the day with the Francisco Lute recall? With what? Never the Francisco Lute recall when you said it's the best show in the girl that has.

And so will you. Yes. Here's the Susan Candy audience. Essentially omitted to provide for my spouse and other areas, including future spouses and children. And other decisions now living and those who have forgotten or adopted. So this would appear to throw up into the air. Yes, Rose. If her son Daniel is gone, he is named if you're in since he is died to whom her assets would fall. For whom the bell tolls and wait till Monday when Susan Candy is reading my will on the middle bed. 1255. What do you bath with? I'm male. I use so of 614 out of 48.9 percent. Good move. Male with body wash. 433. I sell them. They need one. Female with body wash. 55. Hey, this full 37. Amir 2.9 percent. They likes it. And female with soap only 35. So the women are the body wash more than the guys. And like I said, everybody out there saying exactly the same thing. That's right. It's a lady thing, Neil. When you're going to butcher up a little bit and get back to the soap. You know, it's like Thomas and like like scraping your body with a big rock. The obvious thing. So fast. But hopefully there's felt rock. Sports, radio, 560. You A. Amir. It's day. Oh, if I have the towel. You forever have 560. W. A. Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, this is R.M.O.4 and 5. Oh, you.
