Bill's off the old guard? Yes. Count control to Lisa Noah. Count control to Lisa Noah. Set your grooves control, let keep your diaper raw. Best fish control, you are Noah's a lot. I'm afraid to watch. Not long, but so great. So cute, I know of a man. Ah, four, three, two, we haven't dated for a long time. You're a little bit too old. I'm watching you watching me. Oh, my father. Listen to the ball. It's world you've arrived. You're sitting in your doom. Well, that story shouldn't have what you call legs, you know? Sometimes they say, well, this story has legs. What you've got going upstage. By an in a cool spot, that's right. Well, shame on that bitch. Which everyone you're talking about. Well, I still have a little bit of that. Oh, that char truce, puse. Man, not too good. Although I'm doing great, you know, cold is going to land. It's going to run its course. No matter what you do, right? Like one. Like one, monitor. This one completely died. Oh, no. Well, what did I tell you? The monitor was dying over there. And I thought I'm not going to replace it. I'm not going to work with it for that studio. For this studio here, no problem. Got our staff working on it. Yeah, I'll bet. Our staff or our staff are working on it. Your staff and your mirroring staff? Yeah. Any way, whatever. So the monitor on the DCS die down there. You're going to be able to play anything. Anything at all? Well, the place stuff. Oh, yeah. Like that. That's what we was going to get last night. Only I fell asleep. God, I love that move. Oh, he's a little jah-y, kind of funny. Oh, that one, Fargo. Yeah. It's great. I'm going to make a seat for you. And Francis McDormand. You know, every time I see her, no matter what movie it's in, although especially that one, I just love her. She's great. Well, then it will send you a copy of raising Arizona. Why do you have to send me a copy? I can't afford to go out and get it? Well, you know, I won't. I'm too lazy. Well, it's not a matter of that. It's about I already have a copy of it. And I can make you a copy of it. I wanted to do that. I will. I will. She's in. She's in. She's in. She's in. She's in. She's in. She's in. She's in. She's in. Great. And just. I don't know. Just something really need about her. I don't know. Maybe it's then movie. But I saw some other flick. Two and she was great. Bloodstab. Francis McDormand. You saw in that. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, was that black and white, uh, Cohen Brothers movie that I thought was really slow and boring with Billy Bob Thornton. Yeah. He was there. The quiet man. Something like that. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That was, uh, the man was just like smoked cigarettes in the dark and slow motion. It was that what the guy was trying to kill his wife. Yeah. I mean, I was just thought it moved really slow. Oh, you guys with that movie. Oh, you action, punk. You know, when you get to be his old as I am, sometimes if it moves a little slow, it's not so bad. At least you can catch it. You know, when you get to be his old life is short. You don't have time to wait for your events to unfold. That's how it like a shot to me. When you get the old life is short. Yeah. I just might outlive your damn ass. You might just to prove a point just like father lived in 90. But I'm other made it to 91 and you're not married. Yeah. That's right. So let's tourists there. I could walk outside of two o'clock this afternoon, get hit by a Mack truck on a street right in front of my building here. So what way? Just just enjoy life. Yes, by message for everybody enjoy it while you were live because, uh, you know, the alternative isn't so pleasant. Speaking of that, speaking of a rack. A suicide bomber struck a funeral. See, I think if you're going to like do it do it at a funeral, like in a funeral home because at least then you don't have to move the bodies too far. They're already in the mood. Right. suicide bomber struck a funeral and bagged that today, killing at least seven there as militant show increasing defiance to that major security operation in the camp. Cornish, Delphine. The attack of wearing a belt pack with explosives followed a funeral procession into a tenth before detonating the blast and the mostly she eyed district of eastern Baghdad, at least 15 people were injured. Another bloodshed across Baghdad, the a car bomb on a suicide attack of killed at least 11 people. So we're talking about 18 dead so far today and the day and over yet. It's what it's about, um, all about six o'clock at night over there now. About eight hours a head. Yes. More than a hundred people have been killed in the Baghdad area since something had direct chance to the efforts by US and Mackie forces to restore some authority on the streets and give the invalid government some breathing room. Give us some breathing room. Please. No, no, we won't do it. And it goes down with the details. Ah, suicide attack of a group of bomb laden current to a vegetable market and now there's a lot of vegetables in all of them. A lot of dead people over there, George W. A lot of blood in this man's hands and American public doesn't give a crap. They could care less. They want important thing. All of tomorrow's Wednesday and what that means, don't just tomorrow the episode of a real world of Denver that I want to say. Why don't you? Well, I mean, what am I going to do about what's going on in Iraq? Is there anything I can do about it personally? I've been screaming about all of these all about OIL and M.O.NY. I told you that right from the very beginning of their racket attack and nobody pays any attention to me and I thought we could do anything anyhow. And it's just the way it is. It's just the way it is, is Walter would say. Let's bring back Walter Cronkite. He's still alive. You know what? That's a miracle. Yeah, it is. He's still alive. And he's still firmly like Lucid. You know, every now and then Larry has a mind. It's about the only guy that Larry can bring on his older than Larry. And they snap each other's suspenders and squeeze each other's bag. That's that's that's the part of the thing. Now how about that? For the poll today. Well, first let's take care of the poll yesterday. Okay. Let's take care of one poll at a time. I'd like to probably handle simultaneous. Poll yesterday. People are born that way. 766. Almost half. 16. And of course that's the correct answer. Gay people are fine with me 405. In other words, I don't really know if they're born. If they're like twisted. But they're okay with me. 425. They never attack me. Gay people choose that life. 122. 7.5%. Must be all Republicans. Gay people love him hard away. 8.9. But they don't love his car wash. Which they're boycotting and creating some service for him. And deserve a lease. So he's a dumb illiterate jock. Who's entitled to be a bigoted jackass. But you know something? At least they can call him a bigoted jackass. You've done them. You're a schmuck. Gay people. I hate this poll. 53.5%. Gay people want me 52. Like you said, definitely switchful thinking. They want me. I'm so hot. Right. Gay people are all flamers. 5. 50. Gay people wish they were straight. But third man. 30 people say gay people wish they were straight. You should live so long. You know, they don't have like that's how I say. Everybody wishes they look like me. And of course, speaking personally, if everybody wish they look like me. I would just jump off the balcony. See, that's the one thing about wanting somebody else or seeing really hot looking people is that at least they're there. You can appreciate the fact that they're there. Even if you can't touch them or squeeze them or do them or whatever. At least they're there and you can like, Google Adam. Like that, you know. Like Marfoli would go. Whatever happened to Miss Folley. She still got more. She still got more. She still getting a shoe. We're not going to be talking about him anymore. It's bad for business. There are people are easy to spot 27. Sure they are and gay people scare me. 20, 20 said that. That's kind of a movement. It's very amusing when you deal with a lot of ignorance. You know, stupidity. Ignorance is bliss. Oh, speaking of ignorance, there's hell of a way. You need the most important thing now is trying to end this war. I'm trying to get you ass out of the race. That's what the most important thing to get for Racken there. He's going to, you'll see. It's not going to be easy. He's got a lot of hurdles to go. You're about to go to your eyes. I hope so. Here's today's poll. And again, sin and we got a zillion polls that have been said. And I'm going to start using them all. Because the last one I did was the body war. The gay thing too. Where did that come from? No, that was sin and. Yeah. I think I may have added to it or whatever, but I think it was sin. The thing I hate most about growing old is. 750 so far. I won't be able to afford to live. 177. The winky won't work. 92. Or wouldn't that be bad. I am old. 77. That's what I voted for. But again, it's all relative. I am old. As compared to what I was saying yesterday, Well, what is old in South Florida? 70? 65? 50. 50 is old. I didn't solve it. I'm old. 77. Everything. 25. It's your. Everything. It starts hanging that. Like that song by the Kingston trio. Hang down your head. I can't believe that you sent me a short fat fan. It's on my iTunes. Now I got to stick in my iPod. There you go. Thank you so much. Huh? I said, I bought it up. Hair growing in my ears. 69. I don't like it. It does happen. It is. You know, I got to get my trimmer there. The one that Brittany stole the shaver head. The one I used to shave my head. And I got to get it right there in my ear. Hair growing in yours. In fact, hair starts Morris hair from your nose and just all kinds of funky stuff. There's going to be some pieces. Right. I'll kind of a little things to pop it up on your head. I hair growing in my ear is 69. I hate this full 60. 8.5 percent. Well, shame on you. Nothing. I'm looking forward to it. 51. Well, what is that? A lie? They're looking forward to growing old. I get it. And now in a way, I could understand that because, you know, at least if you grow old, that means you didn't make the alternative. You're not, you're not dead. But I'm looking forward to getting old. I got news for you. A bad thinking. 51. Take it from me. Not a good idea. Not that I feel older in it. I feel just like me. I feel whatever I can. I think I hate most about growing old is. I've pooped my pants. 51. In my case, I don't think that's a byproduct of age. I think that's just a byproduct of my intestinal lack of whatever. You know? Well, I just have gastrointestinal problems I've had that for years. Just like you should know. You've got what do you tell me you've got to tell me. I don't think so. Well, whatever it is. stomach issues. I'm trying to cart burn things. Yeah. I can't imagine why that he's sitting there eating, talking to eating at the same time. Eating how he's known. Yeah. That's great. Young chicks won't like me anymore. 47. Of course, the assumption is they did you in the first place. You know, 47 say that word. And my kids will stick me in a home. Only seven. Hmm. I've already thought about that. Because I don't have any kids number one, but I do have friends who I don't know. They could probably, is there something like that? Is that like the baker acting? I mean, is it possible for your friends to stick you in some kind of a home? I don't think so. Do they have legal authority to do that? But if you give them legal authority like that. No, I'm not doing that. I'm not giving them a lot, but I'm not giving them that. Stick my ass in a home. Like, what's in there? I'm a surrogate, old fart. Oh, yeah. 712 votes on the poll by growing old. Yeah. And those people say, oh, nothing. I'm looking forward to it. Right. Oh, I can say it. Sure you are. Come on. It's Saturday, 10 and 5, 16, WCW in there. Do you have what it takes to be a news real? If you do, you will. Sport whole radio 5, 60 WQF. Invite you to listen and wave. With a 560 QAM deals will contest. Simply cut and pay someone else's profile and dig to my space. Or in 50 words or less. Right. Why you should be a news will on the back of the postcard. And on the TWQAM's, then be old in the McAllysphere hotel. Then when you hear this out, that's your chance to win how it's millions. Perhaps even billions of dollars. It's a dollar. It's a dollar. It's a dollar. It's a dollar. It's a dollar. It's less female. No number than 18. No older than 25. It must be shaving and smooth.

All prizes will be awarded by my client today and the grand prize winners are asked to be patient for it. Definitely a period of time until the other sites to die. Ten 18 at 560 WQAM. I notice we ran an extra legal ID there, which is good. You can never run too many legal IDs, Chris. Yeah, but you just claim real well. That's okay. Not a problem. I rather have the legal ID than a super disclaimer. All the opinions, the opinions and a flamm-on-a-shower got nothing to do with the the beasley, isn't it? If they don't know already, we don't want nothing to do with him. The greatest ID, maybe not the greatest, but the my favorite radio station ID, was WKNRD Troy, which really, the station was licensed to Dearborn, which is a suburb of Detroit. A lot of Arabs by the way in Dearborn. A lot of Muslims, what's up with that? But the ID used to be WKNRD, or in with offices in the Sheridan Cadillac Detroit. And of course, the offices were like, you know, like a PO box, like a, you know, like a mail drop, or a female drop, and that was the offices. And a mail drop. It made it time more like it was a Detroit station. Whatever's the greatest station, Kier 13, goes for the days, man. See this business sucks. This business is all done. It's over. It's over. Look at this story about the Exhibenceurius, have we had any facts? Is it that yet? No, I didn't mention yesterday, and we were worried everybody on that as usual. Breaking news. That's right. We're ahead of the whole world. But here's an interesting story that somebody facts in the last. Thank you, Brian. A lot of our friend, Brian. It's a different Brian. Not chicken neck. Uh. Booker restaurant mania. So you know what that makes me think of Booker restaurant mania? Proc. No. Dracula? Yeah. We had a hoon to the castle. But. But right. Thank you, staff. Oh, step down. Got you in the monitor? Well, if I knew we'd be old, but it works. And he got it working on it. We found an old monitor laying around that works. Yeah. And so back in business as soon as this thing ever. Speak out of this poll we're doing today about being old. How many years have you been caught in the old man? I think I was like 30 or something when you stericomedy old man. That's right. It's a relative term. I see. As old as compared to you. Pretty soon. I'll be old as compared to everybody. Well, not if I'm still on here in South Florida. That's one of the good things. You never old Josh Cortis used to comedy. Not quite so old man. I see. Josh Cortis, by the way, got his flavor wave oven courtesy. You're truly. They. Now, did he say anything? I didn't come in here and like, give me a big kiss. He may at all kind of sick discussing such thing. Thank you. It all kinds of slurping sucking. That was Chris. That was Josh. What? Josh is over here having his breakfast. Oh, he's in there. He's in everything. He's having bacon. Probably coming it up on the flavor wave. You don't have to think me. It's just a matter of no. As somebody we know would say it's a labor of love. No, an ericol. We say, John, I'm a serial and bacon together in the movie. I hear he's a serial eater. He calls it bacon flakes. Yeah. He provides the plate part. I hope you enjoy it and have a lot of wonderful meals with your Russian girlfriend. Booker restaurant manager. Mmm. See that helps get the slum out of your throat. Never thought about that. Mmm. Like that. A Roman priest. And I'm sorry. A Romanian priest. Who let it these long experiences in ritual. Oh, that have a little sound effect on this too. That's my bed. That's a whole place to tell you. The power of Christ to tell you. A Romanian priest who led days long exercises and rituals for young other end of the woman's death was sentenced to a state of 14 years in prison. The power of Christ to tell you. Oh, I like that little last of it. I remember when her stomach was like getting all ripped open. Mm-hmm. And remember the one scene I'm trying to remember what at what point of the movie were. Who played the mother? Sarah Goldford. No, and in the exercise, that's the same person. Oh, I did it. You're right. It's terrible for her. Boy, we are getting old. Any hot way. Whoever played Sarah Goldford in recroom. That's the one who played the mother. Anyway, she pulls back the sheets and it says on her chest on her belly. On the reverse. Help me. Remember that? The church. Four nuns were also sentenced in the case. The dead nun, Marciaca Irina Quinici, released he heard the devil talking to her. The power of Christ to tell you. She was treated for schizophrenia. So when she relapsed Daniel Petu Corregano, a monk who served as the priest of the secluded Holy Trinity covenant in North East Romania, and four other nuns tried exercise. How do I still oppose you? The power of Christ compels you. See, I mean, whatever his name is, John, she could be enjoying some delicious piece super right now who haven't necessarily been in the studio. Along with his flakes. For an itchy 20s, we were set up for several days at the... This is making a sense. Several days without food or water, and chained to a cross, I'll ride. She died of dehydration, exhaustion, and suffocation. Huh? The power of Christ compels you. The court of North East City of Vaselui convicted Corregano and the nuns of holding Quinici captive, we saw the interdeath. One of the nuns, Nicoletta, Arlenew, was sentenced to eight years in prison. And the other three, it's got the names which I'm not going to waste my time with, we see five of your sentences. Dozens of Corregano supporters, packed the courtroom and prayed for the priest, several burst into tears when the verdict was announced. 14 years in prison, the defendant's lawyer is trying to appeal. The power of Christ compels you. Quinici's a death prompted Romania's dominant Orthodox Church to promise reforms, including psychological tests for those seeking to enter monasteries. Speaking of somebody needs a psychological test. I'm asking for a sure that I'm not a good one. The Orthodox Church was his benefit and from a religious revival in recent years, condemned the ritual at the covenant as abominable, abominable, a place of Belgium. And Band Court Yenu from the priesthood next to me indicated the four nuns from the church. In 1999, when the Vatican issued his first new guidelines for a 16, since 1614 for driving out devils, he was setting all the new jersey. The power of Christ compels you. Good place for him, by the way. The power of Christ compels you. Yeah, one more time. The power of Christ compels you. Thank you. It urged his priest to take modern side-kind to end what count in deciding who should be exercise. I could use the exercise myself. I'm going out for a long walk right now. I'll be back. Amen, about 155. Orthodox Church is also a great way to perform exercises in rituals, but Corregano's methods were criticized by church officials as excessively a harsh, not only the dropout from the church's religious education program. Well, you don't have an exercise, and don't have some dropout to it on. That's the list now here. QIM Hello. You're there, and it's probably a good thing. You never know. WDQIM, hello. Hi. Yes, sir. A couple things Ellen Bernstein was the mother, and thank you. That's correct. She's a great actress. But I know she also plays a gold part about being elderly and somebody taking you away. Yeah. Anybody can call the abuse hotline. It's for abuse and neglect if they think an old person is, you know, like living with 19 cats or being a baby. But it's right. But I'm sorry. I'm going to have floor stuff like that. Yeah. So that's going on in your place up there, be careful. Okay. I'm going to sort of catch off about any right now. Okay. Hey. Deal. Um, never mind. I'm out. Bye. See it. He wanted me, man. Can you tell? I could be trying to. Yeah. He wanted me badly. I love you, pal. I'm going to send out a 50 in both of these pool. Well, I sure. If I could just get to the last remnants of this. You know what I mean? We're like a like with a shovel. If I just took that shovel down my throat. And just shovel away. Shuffle off the buffalo would be good for somebody not for me. You know, 124, no friends in my space, by the way. Now let me just say this. The fact that there are people who voluntarily live in Buffalo and upstate near. That tells me that there's a real problem with the human race. Hey, pal. It's straight from a Vatican. Introducing new Catholic life. The religion with one third the guilt of your regular faith. You Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity. But it doesn't fill you up with a lot of doctrine. More than a million. More than a million. With Catholic life, there's no confessions, no servants, and no lingering afterlife. It's the perfect alternative for modern agnastics who don't want to take any chances. Our services are held three times a year and they're only 15 minutes long. Plus there's no added guilt for sneaking out during communion. We've dropped that, too. Look for our church, Wibil and your neighborhood. Hey, you might be in the front view. For ye of little faith, try Catholic life because a little faith is all you need. Ten 31. How about some to fill in man? That would be really good. Seven hundred and seventy votes in the poll. We'll make a thousand, even though this is not one of those. Rockham and Sakham kind of pulls you in a while. It was really not down, drag out, get all whipped up to a frenzy. Like the body washing, for example. That's pretty controversial. You know, I guess. I mean, it should be automatic. That's like saying, do you get out of bed in the morning? We'll listen to you on again somewhere. You know, it's something like that really kind of... ...and there's something coming tomorrow. WQAM hello. Hello, Neil? Yes sir. Good morning. Good morning. I hope you're better with the crowd. I'm a small grandmother of the year, which is I used over the years. You probably, from your childhood. It's the cup, hello? Yeah. Yeah. Full cup of the hot meal. Full kids, full table spoon. Full full, full table spoon. Full of the hot meal. Mix it up and see if it's okay. Mix it up and see if it's okay. I'll be mixing it right now. Okay. What was he saying butter and honey and something like that? I thought he said sniffing. Yes. sniff this. Okay. I asked him if he had a strong constitution. Which American used to have before Bush? 774 votes on a pool. Now my throat is fine. I just had the remnants of the flame for me. Ascend of a cold. There's nothing worse than the Ascend of a bad cold. Oh, this was even a bad cold. This is a bad story though. This is very sad. A three year old girl died this morning after being run over by her family's car in the driveway. A Virginia Beach home according to the BS. Oh. The Ascend had about eight o'clock this morning. A hundred block of northwest 13th Avenue. Both the girl and her mother were outside in the driveway. Their names haven't been released. Though details remain sketchy. The mother may have sent the girl back inside the family's. One story due place to put on a jacket said Elliot Cohen, BSOs book. Is it truly this morning still? No, it's cool. Nice. Yeah, cool. Very nice. T-shirt weather. So in other words, a little girl didn't really need a jacket. And if she wouldn't have gone back inside, she's still be. I don't want the mother to feel bad, but you know, if you're clipping overbearing. There's nothing worse than an overbearing mother just asked me. Or George. He'll tell you. No. Don't forget your galages now. Oh, brother. Some of the girl ended up behind the red sedan, which went into reverse. The child was run over and rushed to Memorial Region, the hospital. Hollywood, she was pronounced dead. Investigations that are way to determine exactly what happened. On Monday night in West Dade, a four year old boy was killed. But he fell out of his mother's car and was hit by a sports coupe. Police are still looking for the driver and that incident. Boy. Said you want things. There's a lot of things. I think there's a moral in all these stories. The better the best plan is stay inside. Don't leave the house. Right? Let's just let all those cats run around. Or that was a little bit of this hard shooting one of that guy said. I should have asked him. I should have asked him what the relationship has to be with the people before they can like have you committed or whatever he said. You know, right? I know it was if it just somebody out on a street who thinks you're a crazy person or somebody who's your close personal friend or whatever. And they just decided that I'm going to call him have you put away. Oh, he's crazy. He's a little bit of a crazy guy. You know, even if they're a total stranger. Don't you start with that stranger stuff again. Are we ever going to get that clip or not? I told him. I told him every day. Personal friend Brandon was going to get me that. But he haven't sure he's still working on it. Tapping everything. That's all other good stuff. Which you said was Kenny Sonny. By the way, he's very upset about the way. It's still a little bit branded. He's working on it and the clip too. He's a stranger. I said, yes, I think she's taken over Larry show because she's he's got her like every other night now. Even though we can't stand him. I watched that show. She did take over. Well, she's on a lot. I'll tell you that she was on a getting the night. All the way didn't watch it. I missed the tip. I don't like her as a guest. I mean, I do like her on her show when she's a bitch and people off. But it's right. Yes, you know. But what do I care what she thinks about Anne and the cool. I know there are legal ramifications there. What do I think? But, you know, yeah. Oh, look at this. It's a miracle that yesterday of block commanding 836 on 57th Avenue. You saved my day by not in agreement with that nightmare. Well, you're welcome. How do you like that? Because I went on the year and I gave the thing. And of course, we don't have a news department or QM because unless it has to do its force, nobody could possibly care about it. So we have no news department. So naturally, we were going to give you any information about the traffic mess on 836 because of that wreck. So I saw it on CNN and put it on the air. And here's somebody nice enough to facts me and say, Thank you that you saved my day by not getting me on it. And then there's some other stuff on here. A text are a couple of articles on birth order and being gay. While the results substantially the small percentage in gay men, it clearly shows to be a botanist to be biologically driven in not a choice. We all have a family member somewhere in a world of closet. Biologically driven not a choice. Amen. Well, that's obvious. Two. Ray Calmilgo. Aaaaah. Formally mil, oh look at that lavender. Hmm. I wonder what that means lavender. Gay. Ray Calmilgo. Formally milgo. I try to stay warpied years in software and hardware modern technology. Wow. Remember I was talking to the other day about when I first moved out of plantation acres. The only thing I thought was Ray Calmilgo. Must have been on Friday. Was it really? I don't know. I watched and build the assograss mill. Oh yeah. Well, it must have been on Friday. We're talking about what tells the big deal. I'm asking that question. Nobody can answer me that because nobody who lives in South Florida actually goes to the sawgrass. Right? It's all the Brazilian tourists. I don't know. But the Brazilian campaign that run into those places. I would say the one thing I do like is the food court. The one that's got Nathan's and not because the food courts are great. I just like Nathan's. Don't you? I like Nathan's. Nathan's. For a quick poll it says when sit on. No. Ah. That this is horrible. And then George writes trust me. You don't want to get the four pages with this poll. No, the artists will get the four pages of the article that they're talking about. And it's, you know, pondress from Wikipedia. You don't want to talk about birth order and being gay. Yeah. I mean, biologically, we've never listened. I already know that. And I'm not going to sit here and try to convince people because the people out there who want to use their own ignorance as an excuse for bigotry. They're going to continue doing that. Oh, it's a choice. You chose to be gay. Right. You're saying if it makes you happy to believe that if it substantiates your hate and your intolerance and your stupidity, great more power to you. For a quick poll, I don't think I really want to read this about your member when you're taking a dump on the toilet. Drop it inside the bowl and forget it. Rest it on the toilet seat and forget it. Oh, geez. That night, we'll read the rest. Yeah. Just forget it. Yeah. Forget it. I think it's a good part. This call of this facts you're this person was really well thanking me for avoiding the mess. I just turned my life in a pure instant crap with that whole thing about what do you do? I mean, it's just hang down your head time, do the I think again is the apple opera advance. 786 votes on the pool. The thing I hate most about growing old is I think we left an operative one out. What's that dying? Yeah. Getting close to death. No, because I think that would be good. Get close to death. I don't feel close to death, though today. In fact, if you would ask me aside from the defund the last very last remnants of this call, what's it going by tomorrow? But if you would ask me, I would say I feel no different now than I was when I was like say 50. Since you think 50 is old. I don't feel any different. Well, no, that is that old stupid cliche. Your only is old is it feel right. Yeah, my response to that is feel this, you know. But I don't feel a day over 50. I don't feel a day over 17. Well, good for you. In the end, I was a little worried about that. Had a really slow start because it's a crappy pool. Now I shouldn't say that. Somebody said it. Don't, don't ever knock a pool that somebody said it because they're not overseeing the other one. They take it personal. I won't be able to afford to live on 95. Well, start saving right now. Okay, put away some money. Are you young punk sat there? Trust me when I tell you. Oh, wow, that sounded like a fall. You know what it was? It was my cable box. It just slowed right off the top of the, because I was being very infatica. I didn't hit it that hard. I hit the counter here. And it just slowed off the top of my little citizen TV right on the floor. But it's okay. It'll be fine. Picture still there. I won't be able to afford to live on 195. Put some money away, George. Yeah. The wanky won't work. The wanky or the wanky. I'm on 03. I am old 84. Oh, I am. Everything droops 82. Here growing in my ears. 76. Like a forest growing in your ears. It just, oh, all the scissors, all the tweezers, all the, oh, yanking. Young six won't, don't like me anymore. 64. And they probably don't know anyway. I hit this full 64, 8.1%. Not good. Nothing. I'm looking forward to it. 57 crazy people. I pooped my pants. 55. Also not good. My kids will stick me in a home. 7. And if they don't, some strange out on the street, maybe judge Judy will do it. I can't, baby. The turning table, Janet Reno, as purchased a red fourth pickup truck. I am Janet with Ames of Granite. Today I've got my travel in companion. I'll legal alien, Paco by my side. But I'm just, Paco is my full time house boy. And part time off slave. I'll be riding shotgun with me till we hit Florida. Then I'm gonna dump this cycle. Can't can in Miami. And push them off with a volleyball. And then inflatable superbolts here. I need some meat time. It's all about Janet and they open highway. I'm grown weary of Paco anyway. Oh, not Muchachan. He's believing his stinky cigars all over my apartment. Trying to convince me to do a Monica Winsky forum. That's not for me. I told him, hey Paco, dance and exit. Oh, Lamo Chacha. Plus I got a shot at Hook and Be at Gopwood. Lamo Chacha. I got a shot at Hook and Be at Gopwood. Lamo Chacha. Nothing like ramblings down in interstate that clear your mind. Oh, Lamo Chacha. Me looking for Janet Reno, red fourth pickup truck. Traveling the country's eyes, later this month. 1046 had five, 60 WCM. Let's take a little less scheduled. Mad Dogger two, power hour with Hank and Mad Dog together. Of course, Humphrey is back today. And then he'll be on solo five to seven Hank over. Pants and preview with seven of the panthers to play the lighting. Intrapherment, a seven, 30. And then open out of course, it's the unshused ESPN radio. Guess who died? Who died? Somebody you ever heard of. But remember we played short fact, fatty yesterday. And in the song, it was like Jim Danny to rescue. Jim Danny was by was it Leigh Verne Baker to Jim Danny? I don't know. I'll see you in the minute to rescue. Why were you partying? I'll look it up. No, go ahead. William Danny, a 35 year old. I mean a 35 year old. I don't know. What is it? I don't know Jim Danny. I'll find it. A 35 year Browner School administrator became one of the first principles as a predominantly white school. By this morning of a brief illness family member, city with 79. Mr. Danny began his career in a Browner School system in 58 as a guidance counselor at Dillard High. Then in all black school, and they segregated for Larga. You know, for Larga, there was a really, really bigoted place. You do understand that, don't you? Wasn't every word? Well, I guess, but I mean, I'm talking about for a very long time. In fact, the, it was like, Gluyesh Heaven was for Larga. The Gluyen moved there to get away from the Jews who were primarily in Miami Beach. And they moved there to get away from the blacks and then moved there to get away. Certainly from your people, the Juliou. And of course, that didn't work out too well. Is there any, is there any part of the data Browner now that your people haven't like, I don't want to say overrun that would sound like a very sarcastic term, but they haven't just like infected in Festa. I mean, like, you know what I mean? No. No. No. We're on our way to Canada too. Well, guess what? Enjoy it while you can't. The RCNP will be right there at the border, eh? Yeah, yeah. I don't know, I'm too many Cuban hockey players. There's at Manny Fernandez, not yet. Just wait. Eight out of 11 votes on the poll. We'll make a thousand increases pretty as done because we had a very weak start. A second U.S. aircraft carrier has arrived in Middle Eastern waters. It's promised by U.S. President Bush in January. I mean, an escalating crisis with nearby Iran or West New York program. You'll be pleased to know, by the way, that my cable, my digital cable box is back on top of the TV. Or the problem. See, now that everything, they started calling things solid state, which meant that they used like transistors instead of tubes, you know, right? Here, for example, and this is another thing when you get to be an old fart like me. Remember, remember things that a lot of you younger punks can't, you find incomprehensible. Like for example, when's the last time either one of you had the TV repairman at the house? I'd beg your pardon. Right. When was the last time? When was the first time? Exactly. How about you, Chris? Have you ever had a TV repairman? About six eight months ago, yeah. For one? 48 inch white screen? What do I mean for what kind of TV? I mean for what problem? It just, well, you have a 48 inch white screen TV? Yeah. HD, HD ready out and have a lot of stuff. HD ready, my ass. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. I'm ready, you have the bomb on, man. That's like, go ahead. It was overheating or something like that. So the guy who come in and switch something out. He switched it. But you had a man like George, his 100 years old. He's never had a TV repairman. No, we just used the pliers like everybody else. But back in the day, when we used to have all those two businesses in the TV, he'd be burned out like, huh? They would burn out. Two of those would burn out. And so the TV would go on a fridge and you'd go into a panic. Oh, gee, what do we do not have to go to a TV repairman? And he would come and open it up. And almost every time would be some kind of a... She would also not be the picture tube. No, I don't want to get into a big, because I'm totally ignorant about these sets that we have today. Although I do know that my 46th HD set, the other room, my Samsung, Yeah. That there's a thing, you know, it's got a mean bulb. Okay, the last for, I don't know how long, hopefully a lot longer. And there's a, you can see where you just unscrew a thing, and there's like a panel, and just unscrew like a light bulb, any buy a new one and put it in there, which I think is about 500 bucks, whatever. But they last for a couple of years, I think, or more than that. Okay. But that's what used to happen all the time when you had a TV. Right. And the horizontal hold, when's the last time the horizontal hold on your TV gave out? Do they even have those, I don't think that we even have those on TV's anymore, do we? I don't know. Those knobs, the V-hold and the H-hold, the vertical hold, the horizontal hold, and the picture would like to like sideways and then would I start rolling? When you CC our rolling, if you buy, you know what they have them on is like, we bought a little battery operated for the hurricane kind of TV. Yeah. And it had that stuff going. Did it? But other, other not know I've never seen one. But what kind of a TV in the year 2007 has got a vertical hold button and a horizontal hold, because it just doesn't happen. Right. The picture just doesn't keep rolling and rolling, because we made all these advances, so the point being that when they drop this box on the floor, nothing will go wrong, because it's all like, got transistor sisters inside or whatever it's got. Or they even transistors, or there's a B on that, in my way behind the times. I think they are our still transistors in there. Wow. Why am I on top of stuff or what? I got a lot of gadgets and gizmos. I have no idea how they work and you know what, what do this is make? As long as you know how to do it, what do you mean what do you mean? That's what we have engineers like stuff who fixed this monitor in here. I'll drill in a commercial break. What a world-win operation, too. I think you're saying you brought in the old crappy one. It just happens to still be working together. You know how these monitors are hooked up. They were like all these wires and everything. Yeah. And then, oh yeah. And then everything. Right. Pour everything apart. Got the shop back. Nice gone, Steph man. That can do it. That's what I've been doing. I've been doing it for a couple of minutes. Yeah. One of my favorite calls of all time yesterday was the guy that, who obviously must work like, he must be a mighty bell's boyfriends or something. And he called, said, you know, you had a problem. You got a problem with QAM. We've had a problem. Every station you've been on, Neil. And I said, how long have I been on this? It's a too long, too long. That was mighty bell's buddy, I guess. He cracked me up. Yeah, must be me. Okay. It's not the business. Don't ask anybody else in this business today, but I had an problem. In fact, I've been several stations that I worked there where I wouldn't say we really had much of a problem. WNWS. I was there like nine years. I think right now, I'm tied. I think I was at IOD for nine years. Mm-hmm. WD's news for eight or nine and now nine plus at QAM. So I think this is my, you know, that's a long time to be on one station. Am I right? Yet as KAT, it was only there two years. I and Z. I think between I and Z and Zeta, I was there like six, I believe, six years. And speaking of radio, which is a piece of crap, the two main U.S. satellite radio providers, which I told you yesterday, series and XM, agreed to merge and stock for stock deal, that would create if it's approved a $13 billion company, including 1.6 billion in debt. And the reason that they headed to this merger is because, um, side by each individually, they weren't going to cut it. And I took it at a long time ago. Remember people were giving me a lot of crap? Oh, you're wrong, you know, there's nothing like satellite radio. That's the way of the future. And I kept saying, I don't think too many people, at least not that big of a percentage. I go to pay for something that they can get for free. Unless there's really something spectacular on there, you know, over the love Howard Stern. And they aren't. In fact, the two, if you put the two of them together, they got about 7 million customers nationwide. Well, what's 7 million people? Not many. The country has 300 million people, which is probably like 270 or 260 million adults. What's 7 million people? Not enough. Tiny slice of the pie. Under terms of the deal, which as long and anticipated, XM stockholders get 4.6 years in series, XM and Syria shareholders would each own 50% of the combined company. Fedor and Media Executive Mel Carmez and currently Syria CE. Oh, we'll be CE. Oh, they combined company and Gary Parsons. Now Chairman of XM will hold the same position in the new company. Both executives would be able to tell member board of the new company. Each company will get to name four additional directors each, and General Motors in American Honda will each get to name a director. The deal will need to win regulatory and shareholder approval. Once received, the company's expected deal could close by the end of this year. Although the deal will combine the two largest US satellite providers in the, into one entity. The companies are likely to argue that the deal will not limit competition in satellite radio space. Due to competition, the company is faced from other types of media, including the internet and devices such as the iPod. Ah, huh, likely story. In the first release, the company said the deal will help create greater programming and content choices. Speed up technological innovation and improve financial performance. The combination will create a company with $15 billion in revenue. All is wrong about the number. The company is a company that has a lot of money. The company is a company that has a lot of money. The company is a company that has a lot of money. The company is a company that has a lot of money. The company is a company that has a lot of money. The company is a company that has a lot of money. The company is a company that has a lot of money. The company is a company that has a lot of money. The company is a company that has a lot of money. I could write in my space thing. He's one of our friends. We got 1214 on my space and we got 830 votes on the poll about getting old. We didn't add that thing under about getting close to debt, did we? Did we? No, we did not. I mean, isn't that the main negative about getting old besides all the illness and the disease? And a flam, a f**king and stuff? I would think so. A lot, let's get that on there. 831 votes. And the thing that they worry about most about getting old is not being able to afford to live 205. And you know what? No problem. George will send you a chance. The meal runs your show. 206 to 209. That's his new brain. 206 to 209. Any questions? We want to meet. We want to meet. Uh-huh. We want to meet. We want to meet. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I'm a sinner, I'm a sinner. I'm a sinner. I'm a sinner.

Yes, I was cute. Shane Gibson, the Battle Bahamas immigration minister who's French, but animal coalsmith touched off an island wild, a wild, controversy man has abruptly resigned from his cabinet post. I've been the target of relentless attacks. My good name has been be smurched. My integrity has been impuned. Oh, I love this. Be smurched and impuned. And my character has been assassinated. Never of so many lies and falsehoods have been told. Gibson said late Sunday and stayed on radio and TV in the Bahamas mind. Although I'm stepping down from the cabinet, I have every intention of continuing my quest to bring the full truth of this matter for the Bohemian people yet. Gibson's relationship with Smith, the actress, whose mysterious death and a Hollywood hotel earlier this month, touched off an international custody battle over her baby girl has turned controversy into the Bahamas mind. We could go as you well know. Photos of Gibson and Smith and a warm embrace appeared in the National Tribune newspaper, sparking allegations that he'd given her special treatments for granting her permanent residency in the Bahamas, since he did not meet all the necessary requirements. I unconditionally deny that I have abused my minister of office by granting an end to coal, any permit of which he was under serving or for which he would not qualify to the laws of the Bahamas, and long as that would immigration policies give him said Sunday. And you know what I say in regard to the whole thing, this should be everybody's biggest problem. Isn't it? My guess. After the photos were first published, Gibson appeared live on government owned ZNS radio and TV with his wife Jackie at his side and said the photos were completely innocent. He did not have any sexual relationship with his celebrity and said his entire family, New Smith and a partner at a lawyer Howard K. Stern. Gibson's a member of a Prime Minister Perry Christie's ruling forgressive leader party, a liberal party, whatever in hell it is, the PLP. At the time, his death, her baby daughter Daniel Lynn, Hope Marshall Stern was staying in the Bahamas with Gibson's mother. All that it goes on and on. I can't take anymore, okay? I don't care which body is hot, which body is warm, which one is the daddy, which one had the Tony, I can't stand no more than that. I'd rather hear about the Coke bottle. What is it, candy? Okay. Is that what it's called? Gummy Coke. Gummy Coke. Gummy Coke. You yummy? Gummy Coke. I never saw that in my life. Where would you find that? I don't think the bottle maps yet. How about your partner? And a candy place or places that sell a wide variety of exotic candies like Jackson's Ice Cream, for example? Mmm. What do you guys looking for? And they're controlling for more free. I over there over the weekend. And it was great. You know, Jack, we as we raid. Well, of course you pay. They're going to give you a slipper like you. You're going to give free ice cream a Jackson's. And you're crazy. The guys when they were in here, they invited me over, but nevertheless took the family. That's great. That's a good way to do. Don't be a star, man. Don't be a snorke. It's too much like soft food. No, but don't be a snorke. If they want you to pay, pay up. Just like burn-lacks you to hold me. I never, I never believe in trying to pay back a favor with, you know. Ah, I was a freebie as what I was trying to say. Cheap bastard. He's dead now though. I can say it. Not that I was looking for a freebie. I didn't even know I was going to meet him over there. But came over and just tinkled over me like I was the greatest thing since sliced to the Hall of A. Oh, Mr. Rogers, all the people from Miami to come in here. They all say they heard about us on your show. Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap. And that as you know you've been there, right? Where? Burn steakhouse and tam. No. You've never been there? No. How about you, Chris? No, sir. Really? The tampe is not exactly one of the places I travel to often. Oh, I know. I'm not talking about all the time. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be signing for Scardons. Burn steakhouse and old people. Crystal, trailer parks, rednecks, inbreds. And that's one thing about Tampa, not everybody in that area lives in a trailer park, but they might as well. Isn't that a good way to describe the Tampa Bay area? Yeah. The strangest conglomeration of people. I don't know what it's all about. They all look like, like the people in Nashville, like the product of centuries of inbreeding you know. I don't say that because the Panthers are playing the lighting in Tampa tonight, that has nothing to do with it, but they are. Gelder be on. Well, they're getting, they seem to be on the, not him or beyond TV night. Esco-strader does the weekend games on TV for ESPN. And so they get Geldery on TV. And while when he starts speaking on the, you know, the one thing about an HD set, not only is the picture good, but the audio is sensational. So it gets a really, oh yeah. Wow.

A meal, or they're scoring in the cold Smith and James Brown and James Bob. Yeah. They weren't? No. Ah. Oh. And then you know the interesting thing about him, though. He sounded like an articulate, almost intelligent person to me. I mean, when I punched him up, no. Except for the fact that he asked to speak to me, or would you, that you had to be on the table right in the beginning. That was a little bit of a clue. I'm not over the story. His back-home asked. Plenty till noon. Now, Clarence was in this morning and I'm incredibly good mood. And I asked him for some programming. If she said, talk a lot of hockey to this. View. God. That's a good one.

all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all all If I hear any more of this, is this some kind of a plot that you're behind to begin to turn me on to this crack? And then, the whole thing. And then, the whole thing, the problem of that was going to do the first one, you could just object and say, we're relevant, say, you know, say this final. What was happening in the world? Personal relationship with it began in 2000. What does that really mean? Personal relationship? Is that in regard to the old in-out? Is that what they're talking about or what was that? The question was, I don't know. What did that begin? When did it begin? When did it begin? When did it begin? Yeah. Probably about a week and a half after day and a half, before that. And it was inconceivable. That's what I'm upset about. This is the kid died. Now, it never really pissed me off. He could have cleaned him up a little bit, given the shower. We'll be right here. You would have given him the detox treatment. Yeah, I would have cleaned him up. Poor David's a bitch. Absolutely. Where did he survive? My life didn't know about shit. That's when he goes, going, going. Who's going? She got a drive back and that didn't use that power shit. That's when I go, going, going. No, it's going, it's going, going. Don't die, Go, going. Don't die, Go. Love's been very strong and bad. Just know what is. Oh I've told. good.ググググググググググググググググググググf I'm sure that the most love for a kid over there across the street is because of the fact that he's on opposite me and you know anything that just like the time he went on that other show remember that yeah anything that he can do to you know deep success how are you gonna survive if more is buddies with the city cross the streets of the kid couple of the guys that got bounced out in the york I'm sure they had that in common here's a fact that explains what they got we're talking about which I'd forgotten about this depending on the outcome of discussions in Congress television as we know it may end at exactly midnight the cemeterie for his 2006 wow somebody must have told everybody this is from the MSNBC website okay it's old as you already noticed yeah the cemeterie for his 2006 now that it's over twenty two thousand seven that's the day Congress targeted a decade ago for the end of analog television broadcasting and a full cut over to a digital format so I guess they pushed it up to two thousand nine according to what the other guy said I don't I don't know I mean you slupper's out there with your rabbit ears if you can't afford cable these or they'll pay the bill just send it over to the fair is your right it's what no problem man if in force that means that overnight somewhere around seventy million television sets now connected to rabbit ears rooftop antennas will suddenly and forever go blank unless their own research is special converter box back when legislation was written new year's eve two thousand six probably look safely this is the dark side of the moon but now that date is right around the corner which says what's the date on this thing I don't know does never date on and Congress in the FCC are struggling might likely to figure out what to do Congress I ever left itself a loophole in the nineteen ninety six legislation and could actually let the cut off the slide by which obviously they did it it's slut by but powerful lobby is now pressing legislative to set a date certain for the analog lights out lights out with frank galap I remember that show on Monday nights oh that was a scary show lights out the debate over when the through the switches is strange group of big money high technology home on security in the single unanswerable question just how angry are the couch potatoes going to be it's also a textbook example of the future almost never happens as fast as technologists promise so many people suddenly minutes to meet seven million rameters yeah bear money there are people that living like a rural and the six on the six baby in the six and the poor or you know those weird people that just aren't interested in television not all our sluggish in caracassada so to tell when I drove in the camp for musmal and tanya down to downtown see and everyone those little huts had a tin roof and a little tb and tennontop so they had their little t-we didn't have probably no foodies that night but then of course at night time they go down and robbed the bastards in downtown and get enough money to know about whatever they want a bunch of booze here's a fact that says don't show your age you're talking about satellite radio working is like your parents saying no one will pay for cable satellite blows regular radio away new poll for you think that kneels out of touch oh things that kneels out of touch with and they sent that twice just to make sure that you can't really have just to give me a little stochia satellite blows regular radio away that's why they had emergency other day and between the two of them they got fourteen million subscribers I'm out of touch like you're parents saying nobody will pay for cable my parents didn't say that I never said that either I always love cable I'm all a big cable proponent to make sense because it gives lots of great choices unfortunately satellite radio is you know I mean we got doctor what's your name my name I'm a doctor Laura oh boy and we got a bunch of other Oprah is on here on satellite radio the same crap that you'll find until a bit in for free or for cable whatever so obviously that's one of certain people no question about that but you're at head to send a twice I'm ready for you I'll have a touch things that kneels out of touch with you my response to that is touched this I'm still doing fairly well for an out of touch hold geezer okay I'm not doing so bad I have very few complaints is matter fact I don't know the fact that this business sucks no sciatica no sciatica I have no sciatica I have no recidus bronchitis has like no no water pneumonia I'm just a gout about no no no no no no pout no doubt I've got some fun I do want to scream and chat and twist and shout out the eyes about it you should have seen me do the twist baby and each aha the thought of you dancing it's not working out to well because you brought a rug dancing with the girl I was dancing with she she just kind of gave up you know she kind of looked at what I was doing and she thought like that I couldn't figure out why she kept you know wandering away from me hey it just it just it's more the words personal queen okay I'm not playing anybody I'm playing myself for being the old but class and I was the young class and that's the eyes of her that's what you said yeah yeah I thought you would pay the one by the Beatles which are really pissed me off because of all the people who didn't need to be recording other people's crap yeah there is and like Mr Postman all of the stuff that they ripped off I mean they didn't need to be doing that man look at all the great stuff they don't want to go there and told you guys that's it and I need to go there and be stealing motons stuff my god what is wrong with you people's thousand twenty six votes how did we pass a thousand I didn't even mention it we just breezed on by you know like that like that bitch it the uh wood by me that I

like Miami used to me but uh it's you know I've not made the right choice I can tell you that but I just wanted to say a little I haven't heard you in a long time like third y'all and you're talking about all the old restaurants and I enjoy what do you do shows like that but they're a very simple title memories uh uh at that time when Miami was nice throw this all farce right all of the stuff and I I was just I was just I think about serious you know I I looked into that stern deal and you know what it's a place to money because they think for 14 or 85 cents a month they think that I have little boombox I haven't my car this guy takes off more of these on you know and that is really baby's losses you know just a bunch of curse words got to the after this is not that the public is pretty good he's kind of entertaining he's kind of like you know used to be when he used to be over yeah well if it's a safe craft right right is that before he's about you can't even say craft you know he can't even take one yeah but he's pretty good to say is there's a little off the wall I mean he can't I'd be slow stir so start a sense boring he's not really boring I mean I'm a good one as I

oh no i heard a trader parts of a sir actually in vassaline bill spindle rights in the journal this morning that it runs oil production is stagnating demand in the country's high because the government makes the price against the rate cheap at the same time a combination of western sanctions and a ring in policies as discouraged for investment oil fields resulting in a low in production
