And in the morning, yelling words about sense, Dickie Bee Bee And when someone goes baseline, He starts screaming things on easily, Speaking loud and fancy, Dickie Bee, Oh, Dickie Bee, Dickie Bee, Dickie Bee, yeah, he beat. He's so dumb. He's so dumb. He's so dumb. And that's what I'm talking about. When he's talking, The player from his head is climbing me. When in this dark conference, Dickie Bee. He's a pretty good guy. And everyone's speaking, We should keep this shot shut, Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. He's a pretty good guy. Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. Dickie Bee. He's really innocent. Dickie Bee. Oh, my God. I'm dying. That was a cheap shot. You took saying that the only thing our morning show in these is an audience that was bad. I can't believe you said that. 10. But if I have 60 WQAM, this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life. Which one? There's so much. No, this one about your governor Charlie Yorz. What calm is this from a Palm Beach post? Is this Rosie Lambeet? Oh, yeah. It says, Well, well, well, seems the governor Charlie Chris Bunning roll man's with one of our own his heating up. Three weeks ago, page two reported that Chris the first single governor in four decades. He had gone on a date with suburbar west Palm Beach woman who's a stark intentionally upcoming reality series, hottest mom in America, Kelly Hininger. Since then, Chris has been telling his on garage. He's taken with a 36 year old. He's taken. He's smitten. He's gay. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Right. Woo. Lo and behold, who was sending a Coutini in Palm Beach late Friday. That's right. Chris and Hininger holding hands. My spy witness at the Sheeshie Joyce says there was no heavy canoe towing, but both who I'd like contact. No canoe towing. In other words, no touching, but just a critique of across the table. We've got a little canoe towing on the river a lot when I loved him. Oh, my God. And there's more in that fact too. Well, I'll say that in my pile. 264 friends of my space. I just mentioned that in passing. We got no dots. We got no audience. The transkey about on Friday, if you missed him and believe me, he didn't miss much. Wow. Now, say everybody back today is a jolly Joe Bell return. Probably not too jolly after taking a look at that. And clearance a sheback from being you in the basketball group. He is a silly person. Clarity as I have not seen Joe. Oh. Well, maybe he can come and back. Would you come back? Yeah, I'm sure he's getting paid. You know, I'm thinking it's what about a little over a year that he's been there. The general manager. Okay. I would say that a little bit over a year. And in that year, man, the demand, what's the word? The vanishing audience is just on this radio station, especially in morning driving after him and drive. It's like, it's like, let's get a search part. Is there hello? Hello? Is there anybody out there? Oh, wow. Holy moly, right, man. And again, the engineering situation can use nothing changes. Now, that's not true Chris got a new computer last week. Nothing changes. Only the underwear changes. And that's on this. And I got, you know, my box who shorts on here. Nice and clean from the wash and my sheen. Kind of nice. I got my little washer and dry in here. I got everything that your heart could desire. Well, just about not everything. Hmm. Anyway, Howard Sheriff's office deputies will conduct a traffic check-pought operation this Wednesday. Oh, I don't know why I want to do it this far ahead. No, let me stick that in here. Remind me. Why don't we go with today? And let me apologize for that pool now. Charlie B's, send another 400 pools today. I got a pile of heavily deceiving of all these pools. So obviously, when he come up with that many ideas, some of them would be really great. And some of them are, eh. That's so great. Like the one today. But it was at the top of the pile. And I said, well, what kind of a stupid ass pool can I put on there for tomorrow? And there it is. I mean, it's almost like paper reply stick. You know, rational or spastic. What? I'm spastic. I confess to you. I'm just a spaz that's all I am. I've turned into ways spaz in my advanced years. And I guess that's my fate for until he stick my ass to the ground. I'm just going to be. But I'm a little bit like that spastic. Brad Delf. The lead singer for Boston. I see. I don't know why I'm doing it because I'm in the habit of the last couple of weeks that we had the dots and the phone was actually working again. And I keep looking up there and there's no dots. So whether anybody was calling or not, it's not relevant because I couldn't see it anyhow. And then what's the point? What's the use? Is there an engineer in the building? Yeah, fix it was in here. Oh, no. I said, is there an engineer in the building? And I told Clarence about the problem. And they're running around looking for something to do about it. Every single time you're sitting there, it should be like following your ass out of bed in the morning. Shouldn't be any big deal. But anyway, it is. It is because it's a QMF in a way. And of course, the other place across the street, they got build boards. They're out there promoting their, and they kicked our ass in morning and after in dry. And even though we beat him, you know, pretty handily in midday, it would the number was much too close to the never has been. I would say, wouldn't you? Yes. Closer than never has been like, I'm sitting at between 10 and 2. We got about a five in men. And they got a two. Well, that's not close. But it's closer than it should be. That's because these people are at a coma. Some of these needs to wake these bans. You're up. Some of these needs to get a pitch for. And pitch a little, uh, hell with these bans. This place needs a freaking exorcism. But anyway, Brad Delf, lead singer for Boston a huge rock sensation in the 70s. Although, just about anybody hated Boston. And doesn't everyone hear the music. He can't including me. Do you want to hear their music? Oh, not again. I mean, that was fine. It was fine. It was okay. It was fine. It was a great day. Anyway, Brad Delf was found dead Friday in the song police city was 55. I guess in New Hampshire police responded to a call for help at around 120 p.m. and found Delf dead. Police was sent away in Baldwin said the statement that Delf was untimely. And there was no indication of foul play. He just, you know, he's a lot of the time was dead. He just died. Nothing wrong with him. He just sat there watching the TV and maybe he was a bad chore or something like that. And that was it. The cause of his death remained under investigation by the Atkinson police and the New Hampshire Medical Examiner's office. Police said an incident report would not be available till later today. Delf front of Delf, who rose to fame in the 1970s and had several hits including the highly overplayed and very annoying. More than a feeling, oh my god, I got a feeling and a putty my stomachy wouldn't want to believe. The millions of records it says here now, Brad Delf is dead. It just took us that hanging around and died. That's what's going to happen to me. I think somebody's soon. I'm just going to be sitting on the couch and the room and it just bit and it'll be it. Now how are you going to know about it? How am I going to know about what? If I throw, if I'm sitting in the room and I get like real all manic and depressed, which I'm most of the time anyway, how are you going to know I throw? To not, we're going to play the James Brown song and if you don't come back by the time it's over, which is gone without you. Oh, there you go. Good thinking. Oh, I'm going to be faxing you some instructions for you to do something during break. On the phone with regards to this thing. Or like going to jump on the window? I could do it easy. I could really do it. I could go out there and then you'll see you right now. Wait, get a wireless mic before you do that. I like it. I like it. Before though, the only problem with that form of suicide and I got that story about Richard Jenny suicide. The only problem with that is that if you change your mind halfway down it's not we've heard that idea. Right. You can feel it. You can feel it. You can feel it. You can always kind of like want a lot of the hall and hope that somebody finds you when they rush into the hospital. That's called a feeble attempted suicide. But the real thing, like as if you put a leg over the, because my little balcony out there is like a railing, you know, and it would be really easy to just take one step up and put a leg over to railing. And then you get about 3 to the way you're halfway down. Oh, see this? Maybe it wasn't such a good idea. Too late. Well, it's an another mic. Cort isn't that long, but we really want to hear this. You want to hear what I hit the ground? That's right. Listen, what's the point if we can't go with you? And that's true. What would be the fun? Richard Jenny, a standard comedian who played a solo crowd's was a regular on me tonight. She went and appeared in movies. Diet of a gunshot wound. And a personal aside, police say, yesterday, but there's a lot of celebrity deaths. At least two. Police found the 49 year old comedian live, but gravely injured, and the worst Hollywood home on every spondy will call Saturday morning from his girlfriend, LA police. Oh, yeah, to girlfriend. I want to try to kill himself. LA police officer, Norma Eisenman said, Eisenman calls to the collar to police. My boyfriend shot himself in the face. And he's looking a lot better for it. Jenny died in nearby hospital. He's dead. Eisenman said to have said it not been officially confirmed. And the investigation was continuing. Not top CNN. Jenny would be done today. Jenny regularly, true to the country with a stand-up act in certain several HBL comedy specials. Most recently, a big-steaming pile of me during the 2005-six season, a big-steaming pile of me. Another HBL of special platypus man, one of the cable, Ace of War for the best-end of comedy special, from the basis for his UP and SIPCOM of the same name, which ran for one season. Jenny's movie credits include the mask in which he played Jim Carrey's best friend, Euristocrats. National Impoons, Dad's Week Off, and an Allen Smithy film, Burn Hollywood Burn. Burn, Baby Burn. You have Burn a Big Fat One. He had guest appearances in TV shows he would be hitting hits Chris. Or everybody hates Chris. Yeah. Is he the guy that you jump out the window? No, Chris, I'm talking about it. I guess he doesn't know you're talking about it. Yeah, man. Say portly, he'll answer to that. Oh, fact, Chris. Mary would show them an update diversions of the game shows Hollywood squares in match game on a watery kill themselves. Fraser Smith stand up comedian who often open for Jenny in the MC of the Ice House, where Jenny often performed to young comedians looked up to him. Who's probably one of the best stand up comedians of the last 50 years, Smith. He had tons of intent in the table was looked up to by all the young comedians, a total pro. And now he's... The Brooklyn Board comic first received national attention in 90 of the Showtime Special. Virtue Jenny, boy from the U.S. City, tears later is crazy from the heart's special attracted the highest ratings in Showtime's history. He became a frequent guest on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and continue a career after J.L.N.O. took over with Ed Chin. He also wrote comic material for the 2005 Academy Awards, which was hosted by his friend Chris Rock. And now he's... If they say the trade, slightly dead. Probably it's after 10 at 5, 60 at WDQ and we got Mad Dog at 2 at the Power Hour with Hank and Mad Dog together at 4, which for seldom happens because very seldom they work the same day. Hank 5 at 7 followed by Hurricane Hotline at 7, Eddie K9 at midnight. That's a rewarding lineup here on QM, where we used to be great. Venture had dare to be great. QAM's got used to be great. We used to have big, big fat juicy numbers, gigantic audience, billboards, people buzzing, all over town, but that was in a past. And now of course, no, no, no, no, no. Jackie. You see here me on my head, I just have this thing. Hello. What is it? No problem. Hang on. Hang on. Ah. What do you work? I see the problem. And he's instructions are assuming that I have a keyboard that I can actually type in. Oh, yeah. That is assuming that. There is no keyboard connected to that computer. I have plenty of keyboards. I got a spare one here. Where are I plug it in though? I have absolutely no idea. Oh, it's just some crawling around on my hands and knees on the floor here. Fling and Junar. I see. Because I can't type in a new IP address up on it. I mean, I'm all set to a do-up, but what am I going to type it in with? Keyboard or your mind. And where am I going to plug that keyboard into? I got a couple suggestions. Back home, yeah. In fact, maybe I'll try that. Has to work better than this. I think it's the purple one. No, seriously. Where are I plug it in in the back? I, in the back of the computer, I know that. Only one slot where it'll fit. No, this, this connection was like a round connection. That's right. There should be a color coordinated. P.A. Yeah. Is there a color on the end? Wait, wait, I got a good idea. Here, let me turn on my two. All right. Which is the one over here. Okay, just, uh, hang on a second. No problem. I'm going to do this on the ear. This is good. Now, hopefully, it really gets a big throw on the miss. This is already love this. Okay. And this is, I, I'm going to do this before. I'm going to get on my hands and it's called a pool. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I better not do that. No. No. Anyways, the purple one. The purple hole. The purple hole. No. Okay, now, how's this? Yeah, I got the other microphone. Where are you? And this good? You're ballsy. Yeah, is it really? All right. Now, let me, we're not much feedback at all. Okay, is it purple one? Yeah. Purple one. There's a purple one. There's a purple slot. There's only one slot it'll fit in. There's any slot it'll fit in. Trust me. Trust me, there is no slot. This thing is going to fit in, okay? I don't know what to tell you. In the back? In the back? Uh-huh. It's a regular computer. No, it's an irregular computer. Well, there's a lot to see if I can make a regular U idiot. There's a PS2 slot for it. It's round. No. No. No. No. No. What's the two wrong? Wrong. Okay. I, I don't know what to tell you then. Let me come in around here. Okay, because I mean, they don't make computers without keyboards that I know are. I mean, they could have come out with some. And there's got to be a place to plug it in. And it's round. Usually, usually it's purple. I assume the keyboard has a little round plug that you're looking for a place for. No, it's not a little round plug. It's a big round plug. Now, is that the problem that the 12 is too big? Maybe I've got about a half of it. I've got about a half of it. I've got a half of it. I've got a half of it. I've got a half of it. I've got a half of it. I've got a half of it. I've got a little like your pinky. Also, the price should be small? Yes. Let me go in with different keyboards. All right. Go bum. I'm going to get some other music queue that didn't I? I can a little tired of hot pants. No, no. I'm a little tired of hot pants. I'm a little tired of hot pants. I'm a little tired of hot pants. I'm a little tired of hot pants. I'm a little tired of hot pants. I'm a little tired of hot pants. Hey. Hey. I'm a little tired of hot pants. No problem. All right. Oh, what did he say? You're wise, isn't it? You're wise, isn't it? You're wise. You're wise, isn't it? Oh, you know, baby. Okay. I'm over here. I'm over here. Got this. My gun. Purple. Purple. Purple. Make it. I was, it could've been a smoother segway that you. Let listen to me. Yeah. I got a pink slot that in advance for a microphone. Right. I don't have no purple slot. Well, is it the, there's only one place that will fit. So the keyboard cord stick it into whatever it will fit into. It's bigger than a headphone jack, which is where you would be putting a mic right. It's about the size of your pinky. There's no place to stick it in here. I assume the keyboard that you're using has the little round plug. Right. Right. Well, it prongs in several prongs. Correct. That's a PS2 connection. And there's a place there in the back of the computer. No, where not. Trust me. Great. Trust me. I don't trust you. It has one. They all have them. Are you able to see the back of your other computer? Okay. Let me go look at the other computers. You can see what it looks like. I don't want to look like computers too. Yeah. This guy here, he's dead. There's not that kind of a jack on this computer. Sorry. Now, there are USB keyboard, but every computer has a PS2 slot for the keyboard in it, whether it uses whatever the keyboard is. What the hell is this? I don't know. What color is it? Green. That's for the mouse. And then right next to it should be a purple one for the keyboard. Well, there's something plugged in there, but I don't know what it is. Let me take that other thing out. The stick is in your face. Now, what is possible since this is the phone? Wait, wait a minute. One moment for reading computer. One moment for you. Yes? That you have a splitter coming out of that plug. There's something already in it. One end going to your little phone control box and the other one going to, Okay. Now, let's see if this is going to work. Okay. Typen. It works. Ah! Ah! Ah! Right! Okay. Do those things. All right. What time is it? Oh, you're playing a song. Yeah. This is mine. One, two, dot. And hit, okay. And then jump out the window. That's what it says here. Now in the next time, we'll show you how you use this screen. This thing came back! And there's a dot. Oh, don't make it! I wonder why I do this ungangily, I'll just think that he wore over there. Oh, just get on my way. Why did under something? It's slide this, okay. Right, come on. Oh. I feel like I just ran a four minute mile for Christ. I say, how do you like that? I'm trying to pick you up doing all this while we're in number of miles. Let me ask you this question. If we have a new IP address that they know supposed to be in New York, I just tucked in. How come I wasn't told that some of the time, so they're pointing my life? Presumably, that's not a new IP address. Something happened. I've had to re-enter the IP address in this computer too. Like it means. I'm going to introduce you to the other one. Yeah. Has been sitting there. Don't you think I've already looked at that during our 400,000 other technical screw-ups here at QAM? Well, I can say to that is who the hell are you? I can say to that is who the hell are you? I can say to that is who the hell are you? Oh my god. Yeah. The way that this deal is is configured there. When I go over on the other side there, where those computers run a floor for the Telephone stuff. In fact, here's the evidence. Let me see. What? Oh, I guess what? What? I'm hitting the buttons and now the front. Oh, you know what? You probably have to go on on hook the keyboard and hook that other thing back into it. Yeah, this other thing is what is goes to the early, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. What? So good thing I tested that right there wasn't a boys in your old son. That wasn't there a splitter coming off of that? Where you stop? Where you stop complicating? I just accomplished a major technical miracle. Well, there was anybody in that building on the ear who could have just done that. Oh, there's no question. There's anybody in this, in this market in this business who would have, I can just see cousin Brucey, wildly over the clock, my chance of these with his wig flop and off like, like an orman. So now I got to go play that other thing. Well, at least let me put this thing, ah, clumsy keyboard back into closet where belongs. So there you go boys and girls and other QAM school broadcasting lesson from the old, old that was special. In my lifetime I can never imagine. It's good thing we have that other mic at the guest neck. I can do this. I throw this guest to you. Yeah. And of course, if you could see the way it set up, I mean, I guess I suppose the guest is supposed to sit on the balcony or on the ledge. I don't know. They could sit out the window. 26 past 10 at 5. 60. W. Q. A. Oh, seriously. Any connection between the radio industry and this radio station is, strictly, it's just for one single. Blue. Blue. No. No. No. No. No. No. They're casting us together. Who are they new baby father? I. Could be. One of them doesn't got it made me eat all the hours. Each she could run. That old guy throws his arm. Every bird gets his ears at that. He shot up. Your husband has been back. Looks like none of them will touch. He will be. I'll see that was a test that worked. Oh. He's seen now. But turn it and he's dead now. Of course, I had a change in consideration the never-ways. Who can it be? Who may take you equipped enough there with Toronto. Oh, we got an engineer up there at the studio. His name is. Oh, God. I had a change in consideration. Because you know what I tried to test. And I punched up the button. And there was a funky symbol that comes up under which means. Right. But I did that all my own. Nice goal in the old. Congratulations. Yeah. Interesting part of it is it's so close to the window. You know, I was talking before about the petty one. Go out there and jumping. It's so close. And you're right. There is a splitter hanging down off the cord. You know, but who needs that? Oh, one end of it. Us to me is for the keyboard. Well, yeah. The keyboard's already back in the closet. When I need the keyboard for. Well, for that. Yes. Can you do it up at the floor? The floor. Oh, oh. See, there's a guy in his ears. Of course. Can I do another test of why? Yeah. Just bring up an empty line again. Because now I'm hearing it all the air. Like it's up here to my phone. So I gotta have them do something over here. Here's what I'm here. I'm here again on my phone. That's in this room. It's coming up on the speaker phone. So yeah. Now we have to figure that out. Are you some of you have more technical issues with WQAM? No, no, no. You need to work. Yeah. Nothing is going to be doing about this. This is me. Well, this call is when you ought to worry about QA. I'm pretty lying. Yeah. Pro's act lying. A house cat attacked his other sending her to the house. A by ambulance, more than 20 by wounds in someone Idaho. Some of the city just didn't even really care. It's an Idaho. The cat, a black and white domestic male went on the rampage last week. When a neighbor showed up in the door with a different cat, mistakenly thinking of going to the woman. She went to the door and her cat went berserk. Jeff Nevin's assistant fire chief, a river fire and rescue told the Idaho mom express. Oh, brother. Can you imagine living in Wood River, Idaho? Woo! The woman in our 60s was taken to St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center with what Nevin's described as a pretty serious, pretty serious puncture wounds. Need the hospital or the fire department won't provide any details to the AP Center. They're saying whether she'd been released. I think the owner said she was going to take it to the shelter because that's not the first time she's been attacked. Nevin said, take it to the shelter. In other words, I'm not a thing. I'll take it back then. Okay. Let's try to get into it here. Okay. Now, nobody can do that. That's probably just as well. The least it works now, huh? Now, what about you issue there in the studio? Chris, I'll tell you. We'll deal with it. Yeah, you deal with it. Okay. I've done this much crawling around at my hands and eases. I'm going to be doing all day long. Believe me when I said it then. I'm listening. I'm listening to America. I'm going to say. Yeah. I'm listening to the Japanese. Oh, look at that. Somebody wave the magic wand. Look who's here. Straight from her. Yeah, like we stir. Anyway, let's get back to try to do this. Or not. You know something that's right. I could make a whole show out of that. Yeah. Only I'd never survive it. I must be in better shape than I thought I was because that involved a lot of racing back and forth and running around and crawling and jumping up and down. And I'm just, you know, you're speaking of crawling around in the floor. If you hear, I guess. Not responding is because they're piping the poison gas in here again. Oh, they're piping the poison gas back. Oh, we started with the carbon monoxide. Now it's gone to full on tar fumes with the sewage. Oh, right. Excellent. But they didn't replace the carbon monoxide. This is just an addition to it. Right. I'm talking. Right. And I actually added bonus noise to charge. Nice going Joe Bellman. You got this thing for him like I can't like that one that they're going to put just sleep in. They're not at home. That's so bad that we all reek from it when we leave the building. Really? Yes. You smell it when you open your car door. You can smell it. It says he stinks. And Joe Bellman. You're the bait. I'll start. Do you know what you're doing? Hello. Yeah. You know that. That lady should just eat the pussy. How did I know that that was going to be, you know? Ah, ah, ah, ah. Every funny man, really funny. You know, that reminds me of a raspy that Bobby that Jack asked there running in my space. Ask me. I just want you to think about this. This is something that I, you know, I've joked around with a couple times back and forth on there. I try to respond everywhere that's on there. And I thought he was like, you know, a fan of the show, like a real real, a goofball, but a real person, you know? And I write him back to phone number. This is last week one day. And then the next day he writes me back, oh, that was really great. I called it and made a funny sound. Ah, ah, ah. People don't know why we don't think that's funny. Like they'll come to appearances and say, oh, I'm the guy that calls up and says, Yeah. Yeah. So we're blank and you go, oh, geez. Right. And they, oh, that's what it was. You're getting more often than not when they do that. And you look at them and they like, they look, they give the appearance of being like a real adult, you know, like a child. You know, not like a 10 year old child that you would expect to be doing aberrant, any other things like that. And you say, oh, I made a sound. You're like real mutant. You know, I picked a somebody that wears socks with circles and livenates. Right. And something like a business suit. Yeah. I'm going to go on the guy that calls and goes, but I don't like that. And then we're going to go with the first one. I'm going to go with the soul of both. Yeah. Okay. Here's the pull from Friday. Now that we've got everything technically all over the way to minute. WCWM Hello. Yeah. I'm here. It's the V ever. WCWM. Happy Monday on Gumeo. Yeah. How are you? Okay. Everything is fine. I'm there. If you lose an hour, like we lost an hour here with that stuff. WCWM. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Probably that. Okay. Here's the pull from Friday. 18. 54 votes. See isn't good that I got that phone back. I don't otherwise need to miss all of that. What would we do without it? Probably not much. If a mercer really does go blank up in your 20. 30, but I think that pull sucked on Friday. And I wonder if I'm not too crazy about. But that's all right. If a mercer does really go bankrupt in 2030, 20. But 30, man. I probably be dead by Ben Frenrin 79. I probably be dead before two the way this thing's going today. I'll tell my grandkids was on WCWsfall 369. I'm out of here. Hello. Candida, 224. I still want my social security take. Damn it. 201. I better start learning Chinese now 180. I hate this pull 145. Just connect this connect me from my 288. Lane president, Jennifer 56. I pan taxes. Don't fall sand no mole. 51. No mole. Guess I'll have to move into a cardboard box 36. Alboral have to make a documentary about it by then 34. He will have made one. Whatever. How am I going to afford my nursing home 34? Will I still be able to use my credit cards 24? I'm moving into an underground bunker 19. And I'll slip my wrists 4 out of 1844. If you think that pull was bad. But it's going on today. All we do have a 147 boat's Chris. Now you were out of posking around with your technical issues in there. Yeah, I think that we're okay now. Oh, that's here. All right. You see, I took 40 minutes. They killed some good time. I took about 40 minutes. And I'm crawling around trying to find a purple hole and a purple pill. And I'm going to start taking pills. You know, I'm going to start doing some heavy duty drugs. I recommend that. I'm going to start doing some heavy duty drugs. I recommend that. I'm talking about like two and all stuff like that. You know, stuff that I've know other people that did those things. Yeah, I made them made them act a little bit bizarre. But why not? You know, start popping them by the handful. Although actually, I could go in the other room. I've got those cardism. I could take like a handful of those. Get my blood pressure down to about like 10 over zero. Well, in about an hour and I could be just laying in a coma on the floor here and you'd be thinking, Well, I'm not Neil. Sure, it's funny, you know. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. On the next 24 Jack Bauer takes a much needed rest that they're saving the world, all by himself and they're a steakin' week. But who will project this from the danger of cartoons? Why it's none other than the mayor of Boston himself. Tell him what we know. And it all started with Boston black, and I was on the trail, I only unquad to them. I think this is an actual area for the crime law. They gave here that terrorized my city. We are moon and nights from the inner core of the moon. You're not gonna terrorize my city. You're moody, hunting moon and whatever you are, I am igniting our dad. God, dude, like you walked the mind of my children. Yeah, I'd partially never understood such things. You'll be destroyed. Don't you think I know that I've... You're going down. Explosion will be an extraordinary magnitude. Wow, I was... And just as well for a very old... On the moon? Nurse, get their pants full down a mirror, spank with moody. Hey, dark guy over there, we're gonna be there. You're a fellow, I'm Audi, 5,000. Ciao! So Larry and Jensen Beach is you must see who killed the life of car. Okay? That's what Larry and Jensen Beach said. Sure, it'll be us here. It'll be on a cable, I can't go out and buy the DVD. Or you could, but instead get my DVDs, or I could steal it. Or something like that. Okay, let's get those full smoke in our man. I went through a lot of crawler around and up and down. And gymnastics and high-roboof, things and stuff. To get that thing working. Let's see if we can't get a real call on here now. We did a little bit of a test there with our, you know, 4-5 idiots, 4-5 mouth-reading. But I don't think we're like that. Like Bobby, you know, my space-body, Bobby. I called him made a funny sound. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Bobby, you're a jackass, okay? You're an idiot. All right, let's get to the days pulled before we wait to see that explosion in the phone. You'll see, you'll see, I got a pretty good pile of stuff here, but you know something I'm so exhausted after that exercise. It's like, can we get this on a year? I mean, we've only been doing it up here for five years. Mm-hmm. And what was I in here again? I was here at the way before you were. I was here like a 10 after eight this morning, like usual. And it could have been easily, yeah, I was going to say a good information. Huh? I asked y'all to me, you know, can this is something that can be done before 10 o'clock? Yeah, I was so wide and they sent me that information before 10 o'clock. Well, I wouldn't have been early as exciting. The audience wouldn't have been there for so much fun. You're right. That's true. Nice going fixed. It fixed this. He ought to be fixed. 862 votes on the full. One here color you want to track the two. I mean, that's eight seventy two now. They're coming in a big chunks. I can smell them. Maybe that's what you're smelling. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. One, two, twenty four. No preference. I'll take any two, oh seven. That's my answer. Who cares? I didn't vote for that. I voted for black. Like jet black here. To me jet black here is like really. I voted for whatever. Whatever. And whatever color. I don't care if they're bald if they have a mohawk. Yeah. Brown. Brown, 132. Red, 122. Oh, no. Not red here. I get, I get very upset. Black, 14. I see that's interesting. I hate this full 42. That's 4.8%. I prefer a bald woman. Yo, Brittany. It says 10. That cute. Yo, Brittany. An artificial color blue orange. Like cartoon color. Seven. Like bald, like blue shambi. Gray, five, white, five. And I prefer a bald man for. I've had a 82. Well, maybe this pulls us so bad as I thought. The, uh, hate factor is not like right? And we got even in 79 votes. I did just that. Any day, right? What do you mean by that? How can it? No, it's not connected again. Oh. Oh, great. Maybe we'll get an encore. But I can see the line splashing. Oh, they just came back. Here we go. Yeah, it's just a hiccup. It was happening all last week. You were getting disconnected. Not my thing. WDQAM. Hello. Me, oh, the morning. How are you? Good morning, sir. When is this? Well, yeah. That's in that Hillary bitch. Man, she was on the news this weekend. Holding FDR. Yeah. And she is trying her best to knock down Obama. And I hope that Obama kicks her rear as real. Okay, very, very first vacation. She's here a wonderful political observation. About one of our keen, a suit political observer. Resonter in radio land. Excellent. She is trying to do everything she can to knock down Obama. And, uh, but a meat pit of wood pit of Bob. Very good. Maybe that was Bobby. Bob, your bummer. Bob, your bummer. Bob, your mama. 560, 560, pound, 560. We're going through a lot of work to get these phones on. Oh, my God. He's got a lot of things on the phone. He's got a lot of things on the phone. He's got a lot of things on the phone. Yeah, man. It's like, like, like, like, like, we, like, we do the phone here, man. Like, we just got all the more empty stuff out of this, right? And got that thing clean and pristine. Thanks to this to the silly old queen. And look at the way that thing is working now. WDQAM. Hello. Why don't you hear it? Yeah. WDQAM. Hello. And then we're Bobby. No. Yes, sir. I was going, uh, you heard the story coming out of like, why the story coming out of central Florida, and that was the end of the call. Then we'd be QAM, hello. Okay. That takes you your calls this hour. 890 on the pool and blind is winning 229, gentlemen for for blinds. By the night and waste by time going through all that work, what do we need to phone for? That's what I was saying. Although it is on the big call, right? Yeah, well, we want to get a whole lot more of them. And line nine for get about it. Okay. Watch how long he'll be on. He'll be on the long after you're rid of it. Idiot. See, if it's me, I send Luke and Brotsie right to his house. We know where he is, right? That particular one, you know? Yeah. Prozac one. Right. You know where he is. I just send Luke and Brotsie out. Break both of his arms and his neck. And then that kind of precludes any more of these. And his boyfriend often sits on his lap, and they, uh, you know, they call him from right there. Wouldn't you surprise me? He calls him in Brad's about how the Rubin hot oil on each other. Hmm. 560, 50560, pound 560. Come on. Let's hear it. Square around on that table, man, or oblong. I think we just had some prefabricated segments on the show. Then we could really get down. Start with the other side. Get down and dirty. Mostly down. W2A and hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay. A couple things. I agree with you about, uh, even though we should do your congressmen, uh, he's got some great ideas. He's not a congressman, but go ahead. Yeah, I'm sorry. Uh, and then another thing, Leo. What was that? What was his name? Uh, O's Nowva. Who? O's Soamer. O's Soamer. O's Soamer, O's Soamer, O's Soamer, O'myamam. Okay. And what's he also? And the other thing is, honestly, and you'll agree with me, why are people so far bistening, and Ned is because something happened in their life or just live in his south flater, or just they have no money? Could you answer that? I'm serious. The girl who is a territory, I guess. Those are the territories. He lives in south Florida, then something did happen in your life. You wound up here. 560, 560, 560, 560, and the Verizon SIGGETA Wireless Line is almost 11 o'clock and after an excruciating exercise here, Krollen on the floor, opened up the door and, well, these other things, and we're still waiting for a real call so far. What's the name of Samu Yamama that guy and even though he's a junior congressman from you know, the View. The WDQA in-Hello. They say Q. QA in. 560, 560, 560, 560, 160. You're twice that was the end of that QA in-Hello. I think even if Democrats are the Republicans, they're going to want to make president so a lot. I think that's the best possibility. I guess we'll get the way. That was Bobby for sure. 560, 560, well, I want to say everybody's so political for today, all these more people are going to be in the group balls, whether they're so politically oriented. And you want to know why? Because what they're trying to say is, I have no line. We know that. 901, the one to pull, the votes are pouring in on the pool. It was a smash success this hour, the fact that I had to go through all of that technical lines. They'd love that. And you better admit it, and all these years we've never quite had that experience before. We've had some other interesting things, you know, involving Krollen around and trying to hook this up over. The one who's alive ready to just never know what's going to happen. It's going to be a piece of crap here. That's true. Because that's the QMF in way. It's radio-ish. Not real radio, but it's radio-ish. Nobody QA in, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Can I talk to you? Speaking. Hello. Yeah. How you doing? I can't wait to see the, when they really get into it, Obama and Hillary. Why are we talking about this? I don't know. What is this all about? I don't like to have the two year. And out of here, you have it at two. And get lost. I don't want to hear about Obama and Hillary and Hillary and Obama and Jan Dany and Jimmy. Jesus, God is this boring. What were in this company? This is their material now? Monkey Seam Monkey Doer, that other guy that would know Barack Obama from his ass. And all of a sudden, well, I think it's going to be really, forget about it. It's March 12, 1914 or whatever. It all is 2007. Seriously, you people need very serious help. That's state. I'm just, I have a feeling with the global warming and stuff which I just made up. And I think Florida's going to just wash your way, you know. I just want to give you a little advice. Get that inner, uh, cue. Get it ready. And we're in the swim. We're good. WQA and hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, listen, kind of related, uh, you know, Paul really did a lot. Ten anymore. Well, the important thing is kind of related. Paul Harvey's not on, uh, six ten more years. He's a harder. I've been living in 12, since I was a little kid. Well, that's a point as I want to hear. Yeah. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, let's just get electrocuted. Yeah. I think Paul Harvey just zapped your ass. I think like that. I'm listening to him since he was a little kid. And that guy, I don't know how holding that. He sounded too old to be listening to Paul. I know. I mean, too old and I don't know. I would listen to Paul Harvey when I was a little kid. It's like it would be between ten and 100, you're like two or two young depending on how you know, nine-tenth on the pole. What a hair color. Do you Eating drinking? Most attracted to her talking on your head by the way. And of course, don't forget if they don't match. And you'll ready to show. Oh, oh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh-huh, uh uh uh uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, uh uh huh, uh uh uhhuh, uh uh uh yo da... Uh運. The way. you are state and important. He's one me and my other time and somebody catches in my family. So I'm a little sister. Let's get a fun. We all graduated here. At least you're right. Oh John McCain. So that's difficult. Believe that I actually graduated, but I did. I'm going to say to my let's make it. Okay. Let's get right to the meet with the men. I graduated. You idiot. But this institution represents I think what is that's about our state and our pizza. And yeah, it is for that reason that I asked the good people at the University of Nebraska if I could come and say something trespass on their facilities. Some of the states and the one is the same state and the other. Make an announcement. Yeah, and what is that? John, I want to welcome Danne Bash, from CNN and others who came to Omaha looking for a good stake. And I hope you enjoyed yourself. Danne is always good. Oh my God, I think you must be doing that bitch. I'm going to want to see the woman this year. There she is. And then I believe as Mike Buckey noted, I would very much appreciate any questions. And we'll entertain all the questions. Yeah, let's hear it. And hopefully we'll give you a job. Correct. Complete answers. Just write that in English. What I'm doing for that. And that is mainly because I was two-dured many years ago by the pain. The finest, the other thing that I ever known was sitting in the front row this room today from a Congressman John Limerick Hollister. John, why thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Not just for. We're shaping and moving. This is the right order. All around the floor. I know within your sense of evaluation, I'm a high-high high. But if you get on the track. But what? Yeah. But when you go get on the track. I think it would be pretty publicly where that John went. But also thank you for the service. You're the given this country. Your thing was service on one or two. But above. And your service to the county. I'm not even going to finish that bit. I'll do that. I'm going to have a call. And you are perfect. As a very respected, highly regarded United States Congressman. Yeah. Don't think you put it, James, all over your lifetime. Hey, gentlemen, America stands. And in the story crossroads and it's just for he's running baby. You can hear it. Can you smell it? It is against this knowledge. It's not a source. I saw it all by my arms. That's actually it was started real good on my political field. It was part of the last place. It's the radio. You're 커�ing and war. You got no machine. You need to tell you folks is the threat. And Joe Wells, who is over the knee, was farting. But a second. But a serious longterm domestic problems and divided by raw. That's right. going to help him in the asking what are you going to do about it. Everyone in our way come on. We're going to help him out. Consensus. The America's response to the challenges and opportunities that can front us today will define our future, finding solutions to these challenges and capitalizing on these opportunities. Seriously, you talk about a cure. What is it? Good. Good. Good. Yeah. And I worked hard over the last 10 years on foreign policy and national security. He's one in the American Smell it. Climate change and energy, education and title. Yeah. Basically, so security reform. Yeah, you're great. Hold on here. Veterans, but not an OGSC reform. Oh. And immigration. Within he said that at the very beginning. It's a lie. I have a lot of people here. For these really issues. And I intend to offer new initiatives on each of them. Right. I want to give these. And other subjects, my full attention over the next few months. And I believe it is in the interest of my Nebraska constituents and this country. But I continue to work full time on these challenges. And America is facing its most divisive and difficult issue since Vietnam. And the war in Iraq. And this is an issue that I have been deeply involved in. And I want to keep my focus on helping find a responsible layout of this tragedy. And not the work my energy, my efforts and my judgment with competing political considerations. I'm here today to announce that my family and I will make a decision on my political future later this year. Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, that's enough of that. I wasted three minutes with that. He's going to make it a season on this political future later this year. Well, call us up and when we want to go back to sleep again into a coma, Chuck, so we can revisit this part too. Here's a fact in Jonathan Plantation is pretty worked up. He says again with a GD drop-offs for those of us listening on the internet. I only see two of mine here. It says two drop-offs. It says George Corso should be taken out and shot on the causeway. Like Santino. They shot them in the causeway. And can we get George and friends some dark Vader man so they can breathe over there. Does this position come with hazard pay? It should. Of course with a big box he's making. He says I never knew that circus was in town and QM is their headquarters and then Jonathan Plantation says. Unbelievable. Just like that. Say it again. On. Be a little bit. I'm going Jonathan. Well, what can I tell you, baby, in the torsional. Is anybody know is Jolly Gielbelt back from his extended vacation or did they have been a padded room somewhere? And of course, Paris is there so that explains a lot of what this is going on. Nine hundred and forty three votes on the hair color pool. Some of the society is a paper or a spastic one. I like that. Five six seven oh five sixty and my goal today is not even to read and in that one of these. That's my goal. Call me crazy. You're crazy. Well, Charlie Christ is a real woman's man. That's what that article says. Charlie. You're fair. Don't like he's fooling somebody. QA and hello. Oh, look at that. The same thing again. We have no dot to you there for what it's worth. Oh, no. I see tomorrow flashing. Now Chris is crawling around the floor. Oh, good idea. It's in the phone. Yeah, I know that. I found the tremors are not all the way here. It's what comes back. What do you want? What do you want? You're still going back. I can't see two lines. Not. Can I? No. So the eye dots can do. No. I got no dots. Oh, there they are. All right. Let's hear it. Chris is a line's flashing now, but we got dots. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Yes, I am. I'm just back on South Florida vacation. I haven't heard you in 10 years. I'm still wonderful, man. Yeah. I got them to say, God, I love you, buddy. Okay, pal. Okay. Okay. Okay. You too. And I'm thinking he's probably thinking of myself. I was a good call. I was the first real call of the whole day right there. What is then a bash and like to bash your brains in if we could find them? The substations that you'd be looking for to be an anti-war Republican good luck to you. I'm you think that there is a place in the GOP field for a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a lot. Well, he's he's thinking about it and he's all in over. He want to see if he can get a rise out of the crowd about your can. Of course with that rousing speech he's been given there. I'm sure that they're all like perfectly passed out on the flow. WQAM. Hello. Yes sir. Interesting. More of got some technical got the buckle going on there. Yeah. I want to maybe three people in South Florida that cares much about HD radio. Yeah. And you guys brought some of cats to you. I am on 96.5. We do. Yes. I don't know that. I'm one of the 83.

Hoses that ever gets to be in fine. Right. But any I just thought somebody might care. Hey listen man. Don't be knocking our technical abilities here at QAM and when it comes to technical craft man we are the craft masters. You can't knock what's not there. That's exactly correct. All right. That's going to end just another South Florida A-hole. It's out of material. All right. All right. Say how to Bobby by the way. Five six seven. Yeah. I called him made a funny sound. It was great. I made a funny sound. When I read that I just wanted to sit here put my head between my knees and just cry. You know I do a lot of that. But I just want to sit here and you know roll up into a big fat ball. I got all the other kind of fat to do. Even like you know done there in the low 180s. I just can't crack the 170s yet. You know I can't crack through. Although I'm reaching here and pinching that fat flat. You know it's not it's just a shadow of what it wants to. I'm not going to be making a difference. W to Q a and hello. And you know it's not it's just a shadow of what it wants to. I'm not going to be making a difference. W to Q a and hello. Yeah. Speaking sir. Yeah.

I would bet your life on it. That your governor is. Yeah. Okay. I mean we're not going to make any difference. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Except to make some a liar in a hypocrite. But other than that. I love you, pal. You were a lie here for a good two when you didn't come out of the closet. Yeah. Right. All those zombies years ago. Yeah. I was a lying hypocrite two when I didn't come out of the closet. When I was running for office back then. Remember that when I was anti-gay. And when I was all the sort of crap. Yeah. I don't know.

So watch out for the Gruper out there. Gruper? A Gruper. 17 out of 20. Wow. You know something when you said marginally interesting, I thought maybe you were right. But, no, no. 957 votes on a full day, which is a horrible full, but it's a hell of a lot more interesting than Gruper fingers. I'll say to that. What hair color are you most attracted to?

You know, I haven't used difficulties today. Huh? Yeah, you want to pop it up. Okay, did you just relax, okay? Because I noticed that there was no tag for that anyway, and wouldn't have been effort appropriate. But I'm sure that if I get into the right week here in my pile, they'll find the appropriate spot for pumping a park. What's today today? Here it is right here, right in my hand, and the spot too. 11. 13. Q.A.M. A little boy? Huh? It's been worth my internship at the year ratings and time. Oh.

You can smell it. Hmm, man. That's how he got mad. That's how he got mad. What the hell was that all about? I guess you want to see if you get like a sitting motivation or a band of bash. We get up there and give him a big kiss on the lips or what was that all about? I have no idea. He and his family are going to be, in other words, he's threatening to run. You know, Mr. Antewar, Mr. Not the all the way to the right, the Republican. I mean, generally politically, I think he's a pretty good guy. But in terms of that speech, man, even, even, Sory would knock him off his feet. And the one guy this morning, he is right though. We don't want to talk politics. I mean, because it's really boring right now. But Barack Obama, I can't, I'm salivating waiting for the days when Barack is debating Hillary. I think what you'll do is you'll just kind of like creep off the stage and just disappear. You know, after about the first five minutes, no, she'll sit there with that same expression. What I'm saying, ice princess cold, we're going to, like, He snores something bad. You know, and well, listen, if she's a, you know, If she's in her body, maybe she should be snores something bad. I can't tell you what it is. But I give you a real good eye, but yeah, something in that area. Something that in that literal territory, nine hundred ninety four votes on a poll. Why sound like all lifts it up and real happy now? Happy year? My am. Doesn't, doesn't take much with me, you know what I mean? In other words, when somebody reaches out, you'll be a little pet on a back like that. And then, and that's what I need. That's right. Kind of pushed me up for the whole day. Steven Elliott, those sounds a little peot on my spurking shamp. He says, Bill O'Wiley slanders me. I threatened I was going to be named these, but you know what I lied. He says, for all of February and part of January, Tour the country with the sex workers' art show. The show is made up of current and former sex workers. I used to be a stripper, so Steven Elliott. Huh? Three of us were writers, and we read about our experiences, dances, and prostitutes. It was in performance artists from Japan, another from Olympia, two-prolust dances, and a musician. Basically, this was about people getting no sex workers as human beings. People with talent who participate in the American economy, and who deserve healthcare and labor rights. It was one hell of a show. We did 33 shows in 31 cities and 35 days. Most of our performances were colleges like Reed, University, California, Have a Fert, or is that Haberford, Barred, and William and Mary, where we got caught in the controversy we never saw coming. The short version is Rain Cross was recently removed from the chapel, because some people felt it was offensive. I've nothing to say in this particular controversy, but it was a big one, especially in the conservative trades. We showed up at the school not much later, and so the story ran, William and Mary bands cross in white sex workers. There was even a cartoon in the Washington Times, of course, the two stories have nothing to do with each other. I wasn't going to get involved in this controversy until Bill O'Reilly and his characteristic way decided to deliberately lie about us on his program. He claims we were soliciting students in offering sexual services for pay on campus. This is an outright lie. There were 12 of us on this tour. Hey, Bill O'Reilly. Yeah. We traveled in two vans and slept four to a room at night. If someone was soliciting business, we would have known about it. I wouldn't know about it. The goal of the sex workers are to his noble is about education and empowerment. It's not about turning tricks in college campuses. No one is more intangible to your pure heart than to show his founder Annie Oakley. Bill O'Reilly could learn a lot from her about honesty about doing what's right, instead he liables and slanders clawing through the mud and search of any attention at all. It film has any integrity. No. And there's no evidence he does. He listened to Paul D to the trouble us. It's no wonder the Democrats refused to debate on fuss. This is not a news channel at all. No kidding, Stephen. Stephen Elliott says it's not a news channel at all. Well, fake news. That's what the offense stands for. Fake news channel. 1997 on the pull. I bet you if I click it, refresh it. And that was some more deal with it. And you're right. See if I would have found that splitter hanging down there. I guess we got, you know, I should have remembered that there's a splitter when we're talking about the movie. Well, but David did a make it. I would have just fed up that process a little bit. I who would want to know. I wouldn't have had to go in there and pull out a thousand votes. Even. Oh, baby. A thousand vote and vote right on the nose. Do you see what a phenomena we've this is going to be? No, when you come to the occasion, first week of April. No, and I'm a vacation week after the act. Correct. Well, that's something. Won't that be special? And that means we get jazz quarters back in there again for that guy. That's got the hospital. Yeah. In the guy the caller out there saying, oh, I sure missed. George court is when Zika, but we don't need that fed Chris. He said, portly. These are fat. Oh. He said portly, but he meant fat. 27 past 11 a QA and everybody. I killed your honey. G is full of the gas. When you think it can do you is full of great red men's shoes. Oh, more than two. And it's for the phenomena. Won't your friends get that to be? And it's for the sedative jelly. And she's high-line and then you go. That guy makes a vote. We, this is you. Come. Some of them, George. You need my shoes. You're going to get it. What's it in? To kill some kids for the NRA. God, who's one man, which looks like you. G is full of the cori. The things you can do. You be an underrated, in red groups. And it's all the NRA. That's both at the wedding. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. And it's for the sedative jelly. One more, you can do it. Let me ask you one thing. She likes it. Oh yeah. Let me 3426, so no one should love baby at Seamork and I can't wait. Angry people crazy people with guns. I'm pissed off. I don't like why I used to work. I don't like my next door neighbor. I don't like the guy across the street. I don't like the way he passes here. I don't like the way this guy is driving next to me. You're on a highway. But I'm paying. That's the way you do it. Just like St. Timos said before he got blown away in the cause way. Don't pay me. You're blown up. I'm going to say it about 14 votes on the full. That is stellar. For a stupid pull question like this about a hair color. But then again I think it's got sexual overtones and undertones. Everything's just. Yeah, like when we did the thing about paper or plastic, this got sexual overtones depending on what you're wrapping up into plastic. You know that's right. When the paper or plastic shape like. Huh. Kind of like the state of Florida no doubt. Thousands, 17 votes. Well I love when I start to vote. It's got to start coming in big chunks, you know. They ain't chunks. Like pineapple chunks. And that's what I think about me. I don't know about you. But of course I shouldn't be in the same way because it's a sure sugar. You know, never been a big pineapple fan. I like pineapple, but it makes your mouth gross. I can't have like a lot of it. You know, one of the times that I went to Hawaii was there's six times vote. Why love Hawaii? Man, like he is beautiful. And when you're a car like I always do when I go there and drove all the way up to the north beach, you know, north shore, whatever the hell I can see it. So many years ago, north beach, my ass north shore. And so the gigantic waves and all the surfers. But anyway, and I think drove right past the dull pineapple plan. Okay. Oh, I see him in the story. It's almost as far as I can see. I guess I said before, it's marginally interesting. I didn't promise it was going to be like, simple rating or spectacular. But it was just, yeah, it was just something to do. See, that's one thing about me. Well, like when people go to Vegas and they don't run a car, I don't understand those people. Hmm. What are you going to like that? Another one. Oh, I just ran it in red a car, but if you stay on the strip, you don't need one. But that's the point. If you're going to go to Vegas for a few days or even for a weekend or like a long weekend, don't you want to drive out in the mountains and see all the sights and go out there and see the rock squires and all those other people? Not those mountains. I mean, that took a tour of the whole thing. I was there, which took a little bus tour over to the Hoover Dam, but damn. Yeah. I was like, oh, is that like that damn square and Amsterdam? That's the damn, that Amsterdam. That's my question. And we know over there still plug in the zone.�BENDEM. Could be. Damn. I can't stand him. He's another one of those people. If he's in the movie, ah, not for me. Good plan. Yeah. I don't know what it is about him. He just sucks. Yeah, that could be it. That could be part of the problem. Like Richard Gearders and other one. And what's the one you were talking about last week that you can't stand if he's not a junior? Well, there's no, there's so many questions later. I see. I don't have any problem with that. You know what? He has been so eclipsed by other people that I hate. Yeah. The role is the one that I was talking about. You're thinking of. No. I'm in the shadow. Yes. Okay, whatever you say. You saw? I'm a green. Well, whatever you say. Five, six out of our poll question on the air, though today is what are we going to do to get those numbers back up again, especially on that morning show? What? What shape does the table have to be to get you listening to our morning show again? Because I mean, say the square table ain't cutting it, you know? What? Trap is a weed. Cause your happens with a weed. That would be good. WQMyN. Hello, it would your the oil. Did you? Eight, ten, and yeah. Ha ha ha ha. Five, six out of it. Five, six out of it. Brian Wilson and the beach boys and he asked me to like it. But anyway, five, six out of it. Oh, five, sixty and pound five, sixty under Verizon. Sing it a wireless line. WQMyN. Hello. Yes, sir. That's your natural habitat, isn't it? What is it? Your natural habitat isn't it on your hand beneath? Yeah, right, wrong. Five, six out of it. 5060 pound five sixty there's only one thing I want to say well there are many things I'd like to say but most importantly Okay and pound five sixty and he provides a ticket around the time See we're not gonna get a lot of calls about our morning show and his shape of the table anyone in the line because most of the people listening to us right now are listening to our morning show that's that's unfortunate What are we gonna do about that George isn't listening to it what and then when I'm in here in the morning now waiting for your Ask to show up there to about the twenty five I have it uh... on very very low so just as well you know like oh speaking about some of you what I did I don't think I've ever done this before my life and you're gonna really chew me out and you're gonna say you're gonna say you're getting your old time is disease act enough this is not good but the last night I quit the law some on the stove you know little supper and uh... this morning I went in the internet to look my bacon at the thirty one ever like how we do and luckily for me while I was lucky to have a be here right now if I would like made a bad move and when I as I reached up to put my uh... the stuff with a paper towel and then the bacon in the microwave I felt some heat and I looked down in the front right burner was on it was on low it was on all night everybody does that they do everyone's in a while sure dang what it wasn't a gas stove uh... it's here say my electric stove is on if you imagine the pot the possibilities if I would have gone over to kind of like braced myself to like put that they holy macro baby uh... and there's a person or once in a while and I do have this fear of heights I didn't use to have it really and it developed in many years ago at hazel park in detour that was i was on the upper level and for our summaries that i looked down you know i would straight down and at that point i got like busy it on from that point on i started developing fear of heights for example i have this little balcony here my apartment and here on the summer time it's nice of you it's got room for a couple of launchers out there you know and friends when they come up they go out there and they in fact what they really do is go out there and smoke a facadon the about because they figure i don't know if you can hear it's on a problem how do you like fire to one of those while i guess they're already claiming do you want to say yeah yeah but i'm a local out there because i'm really nine i'm nine stories up here my building in a local out there because if i look down i'm not saying i want to jump but i'm just i don't know if you you thought i'm not i'm not it's uh... it's one of those things and when i went to the top of the empire stapling last time when i was in New York you know you go to the take the elevator you go to the top and they've got that high railing over there to burn i don't think it's really possible to jump from the empire stapling because they did a railing so high but you look down and like i mean start getting seasick and the room is spinning it's kind of like your situation near and that studio yeah seasick that's what you're without the aroma thousand thirty one votes on the pool i say twelve hundred days while we're shooting for what you think Chris even on a poll like this above brown hair and black hair and purple hair and curly hair dumb as dirt this is the moment you try to close you're on the way up without any close you lived in your shirt to show you your chest you did not cry in secret and they might take you off the show so new was came out there are disgusting you open your mouth but it isn't a thing you're fair with it you say those phoneers on that knee that you run your knees that run in me baby and baby see me on the show cause you just knew things you show me some skin we're by the end you're not playing in you made it a mistake you get it right right you don't want to do that you get the time you just knew things you can't wait no night one things for sure in that merry shine you just knew things you just knew me ten forty six and a poor and they live in forty six and a clock oh my god take a few could that baby wow what could that mean anything no no so they just had uh... commissar america and a lot of headline news do never ever or judges uh... doing a trace yeah i guess i was at a peace not back call it cops all and no i think it must be all those toxic fumes in fact he's probably releasing somewhere now but nevertheless so close air commissar america's in a new zinc of red line news and uh... he's written a thing about how he was molested by a priest when he was fourteen years old this is what he writes they just had a monsoon and on the regular on the main thing he's back you're back do you know what you had a news no occasionally but not as a rule you know who's about this is one of the new zankers no fourteen they've used last three years it took nearly twenty years for me to get the strength of my views behind bars now a year after justice was done i'm ready to tell my story publicly and ways i never had before he says my views are was father jiff two a trusted man of god he was the equivalent of a religious liberty my private all boys catholic school and bottom or father jiff was every boys friend and mentor i consider the my mentor as well that's tormentor when my parents divorced i was sent to father jiff helped me cope with all the changes divorce in the mid eighties still seen so foreign plus i was just a kid and i didn't know much about divorce i just knew it's sucked all i had it that time in my life was my family and school did those were my constants but as my family fell apart so did my life at school after the abuse began high school became a prison of shame and lies i felt trapped my parents would be horrified and other favored marriage put their son at risk to be sexually abused and at the man i'm using me was the high school chaplain and beloved priest and then is a link on here says rock robber's mom say the priest will burn in hell all i want to see that i'd like to see that too would not just see boy yeah um i hope they have picked radio at six the school would never believe me i thought my fear that i'd be expelled if i revealed the abuse i was 14 with no voice except the one in my head saying you can never tell the truth about what is happening roughly a month after the abuse started i attempted to commit suicide i took a bottle of my mother's pills i lined them up one by one on my maple dresser i took them all and lay in my bed hoping to just fade away and die my sister passy came home and found me it was the day before her 18th birthday she saved my life that they just by merely coming to my room to say hi he saw the pill bottle and went to get ipacac which made me throw up what is that if we can't get it actually throw up it made him throw up i never heard that what is it like it's used to do the vomiting well why would you have that in the house to do the comedy okay or you could just work in qam and being a studio or or you can be dealing with these take the most rough my parents were terribly upset by my actions no father Jeff was told i tried to kill myself all agreed i just need more counseling father Jeff's exact words were you have so much to live for well yeah father Jeff liked them or when he was alive he's a little bit warmer i felt so cornered i had nowhere to go and no wonder run do i just became numb to the abuse this two shelf passes one of my favorite religious things the abuse did pass but left me so insecure about who i was when i was in college another boy michael goals came forward and reported his abuse of the hands of the same father Jeff i knew i could help michael if i two reveal father Jeff's abuse but i have a feeling a self preservation i remained quiet michael wasn't believed in his case was thrown out of court nearly twenty years after the abuse started i became strong enough to go back and can probably happen to me i was strong enough to tell my family the truth i was strong enough to report it to the arts dices and i was strong enough to call michael goals and tell him i'm sorry in that i believe in because it happened to me too together we were strong enough to see our views are finally commit uh i admit his crimes five of Jeff was charged with ten criminal council child sex abuse and relation my case he asked for a plea admitted his guilt and court he was sentenced to five years in jail but only served ten months it was released early to serve eight months of home detention this story is so layered for long time i couldn't talk about it without crying but he or go see an anchor anderson pooper and see an nc me producer Charlie Moore approached me by telling him following my story i was scared i was scared of being so honest and televising his journey what would people think what i ruined my career but i came to the conclusion that i will not be scared anymore i won't be scared to tell him the truth because it might be uncomfortable for people to hear if the story compels even one person to see come for being sexually abused then it's all worth it all it takes is telling one person from there strength rosy and you can tell a second person so on then you can finally have controlled of your life back he's got to be on inerson pooper tonight by the way i think what i watched that i never watched Anderson's pooper hey Anderson do fair when that's right one of his friends will call them right now and uh so Anderson is not uh he's got two of your friends in the park region of paratry and he likes a big pair you know whatever i'm sure he likes a big pair all right but i want you to think and thousand fifty-tv votes on the pool pair rhymes with hair as in bear bear and bear whatever we're at it bear rabbit five six seven oh five six and about uh

see what that is all right i would take a whole bunch of these calls we have like a real sweep of phone calls right now but there aren't any little spastic on the phone today after i after the early part of the show if you missed that you missed some real radio history boys and girls old meal crawling around on the floor stick in this over here and stick in that over there yeah trying to find a right this slot and a right bar cord no another with that dim yeah isn't it lucky thing though that all these extra keyboards all right i thought was creative i got to just unplugged the keyboard from

Okay All right, yeah, it's kosher to play but anyway, what's the significance see what I'm thinking I could be wrong other than your mkipper You own kipur excuse me for all your worth axel you a farbiz and other than that I'm trying to think of any holiday that hasn't just become others cues to like kid right along Yeah, you know it just about every holiday isn't excused Hardy Get drunk off your ass.

I guess that's a free curl everybody come on down anyway supposed to be their birthday But sometimes it's a day and important day in the same's life, but there's it every saint has a day that's attributed to them for example My birthday is Saint Nicholas's day December six. Wow. That's for Christmas anyway Saint Patrick ministered to the Catholics. He's the one that to the Irish. He's the one that converted a lot of them to Typical socialism and so so there you go and also he's supposed to have been the one that got all the snakes out of Ireland Oh, that's the most important thing. He rassal with him snakes. I'm gonna fear the worst experiences. Yeah, and What anyone anyone he wanted me came out on top so to speak Let me 55 and before we got 200 like these. You know something I like that is it only Monday There's no sense in sitting the barway up there high. I said, well, we want to get 45,000 votes day You know when it's not gonna happen So the 1200 we got looking Chris can I sit back. I didn't hear anybody eating anything today. That's not good Well, the community is not you know during that chaos when you were crawling around on the floor That's in the food came in and we were you mean during the equipment or is that before the show? The during the equipment part. Oh, I see that so we just ate during the break But thank you how he wants again for good. Nice. How he's for taking care of our people there on listen. Yes, since you Love the house take and we're gonna say yeah, we shot and tell everybody to love each other day Let's make it a big love and when you smile I don't love Chris or at the very end The very least give people a little pat on the shoulder, you know a little pat on the back of the head. That's all I need WQAM hello. Hey, you know I've got a two observations on that morning show. Yes sir. It just drive me absolutely nothing And one is that they last at every little thing effective at the canned humor machine going on. You know, I usually when I turn it on I'm hearing all this and I always think to myself, yeah I must have been something really good, you know, because you know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah He's definitely been talking except wasting time of your life. Oh, the second point I like to know is this really really actually about next The guest speakers have one of them being through Rosenhouse. Do you want to know where all his burgers What does he have to say he's like a week money? They pumps up some odd with dealership about a minute and a half That's a tree dick was I'm not a listen for the roughs. Oh, no, are you telling me the drew Rosenstein house grants those spots when he's on there? Yeah, there's those spots. Oh, no, oh Oh, you know the world is coming to run this out once know what that's it for me. I'm going to the balcony I'm going to jump right now. Happy talks about his own players for about five minutes or so and how great they are and yeah The other it does a huge spot we've got all kinds of cars. I don't want to ask more, but I mean I don't know We've got for Rari. Okay. Okay. Why don't I hear the spot again? Yeah, is that for true or what Chris? Yes, he does car spots for a luxury car dealership True Rosenhouse steam Schwartz word does a spot. Yeah, that guy I thought he was just a guest celebrity nerd. Yes, again And what about my guilty is on there on Thursday doing a terminal pancer talk. What about? He was sponsored and they do see I remember back in those days you talk about spots of the old when you have to spy like a leopard spots of the Practical and they have a I think if there's a clinical name for that. For that disease But you remember when he had guilty and Joe Rose and D4 one there the three of them together and and he going to a break and all three guys And then they would complain about the lights and the breaks right But all three guys would do a live spot and then they go into like a six minute recorded segment of spots So you wind up because each live spot was a minute it would be like two minutes. So now we're talking about let's see two four six about a twelve minute break every time Remember that must be good ratings and Well, it was no one seven. I'll say that. I mean then we're getting reasonable nothing spectacular But but the station overall back then was doing fine. We were kicking ass mad dog kept most of our audience at two the hump It was getting nice numbers near everything was a okay. Oh, we're fine. Right But not good enough for bread. We know no mess with success. I remember seeing one day at IOD and screaming I figured what the hell change it just made everything was going along so hunky door. You know okay dokey Okay for no key and maybe they had a screw around again and I'm sitting there screaming mess with success Air read person in this business says every so called program or the solely know how to do if things are going really well Fix it but it's not great if it's not broken fixed it did or with it mess with it And then of course, you know and then that began a series of like That that worked out really well, didn't that that was really good And then of course the Howard sperm show that the you know where we're bleeping out every fourth word like In fact to me the favorite I now didn't actually hear myself, but the favorite steering show of all was the morning He was doing something with a fart sounds or farting contest. I don't know like a half hour And there's ducks in the near poured duck. She said no with the headphones on having a nervous breakdown going like like that Yeah, eventually they decided that the delay wasn't able to keep up and they just went to music Yeah, and so they they start playing music Because he couldn't keep up with the bleeping out all the parts sound because Joyce was having a nervous breakdown because he she she is so hysterical She thought she could actually smell them all that's why she was over right you know, he was hysterical Like like a Connie was a guy it was currently there was a K whoever she's a sterile. Anyway. It was Connie. She's a state. I was Connie because you know She knew that Michael was responsible for Carl. He's making her a little bit prematurely.

That's in the fourth laughter start because they're not comfortable Because all we know is for If you think they're with you when they start with the Crossing the line, six talk and try to talk about who got the lead the 94 and how it was and how good it was and how bad it was and how often it was Like that There's no natural flow when they talk about anything other than sport like sports and can drive and I think that's it that I'll try to be there. They're needs are fish or foul. You know what they want to do is they want to do a sports show that's got a little bit of something else in it When you know a sports show is still a sports show and when other lead will you try to put on it if 90% of your guests are sports oriented or 100% of your guests and 90% of what you're talking about it's a sports show disguises and entertainment show, which it's not You know make up your mind what do you want I think that's the question Why do we what were different thanks numbers letting pets that part of the show two two All right On the occasion I want to get caught up with sports like enough in the manager leads because they have some personality to them but Other than that is the terminal Well, if it just it is part of a single room that's going on here and they're not doing any promotion and the thing is like sinking and Joe Bell is out of town And this one's out of touch and experiences busy playing you and basketball And basketball even and we're like you know, we got some issues.
