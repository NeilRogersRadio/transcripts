Okay let's take a look at that award winning pool right now see how we're doing but we're going to get on here 130 that sounds like a real swalli splendid idea to me a capital idea is they say in the capital. 937 most were we're getting close to a thousand that even eleven o'clock yet dammit. Here's the pool well I'd surely be man what we are putting on the payroll for the pool indeed. I got a pop we got a 50 pool idea from him and he sends good ones too which is I'm not saying that anybody else sends bad ones or the Georgia driver come up with a bad pool idea that would be a very very bad emission admission to make not good but we do what do you miss most about your youth sex with young people my own age 187 I can honestly tell you I never had sex with the young people my own age when I was a well yes maybe I did you know just talk about a little adolescent experimentation you know I mean I'm sure you do being irresponsible had no real consequences 155 my body 139 oh how I miss my body real news music 80's read my here 68 being in fact that's what you're gonna be saying when you're all up in heaven this audience because they listen religiously they'll be in heaven they're gonna say what are you miss oh my body oh no real music 83 my here 68 being single 66 American Americans were mostly like the broad 50 we were like popular man oh yeah you from a dilemma that oh yeah being ignorant as if light for example ignorance is bliss 40 I hate this pool 38 real radio 28 bless you remember those days long long time ago like that song goes segregation 27 being in school actually learning something 25 I never got around of that there's Rob Hanna again he was real pretty man he looks like a pretty guy the cold war at least we knew who the enemy was 13 my stand I wouldn't anybody missed the cold war what is it what is that man is that mean is supposed to what we got now oh you know they missed the top half of her we're looking we got now I guess that's what they mean my stand a 12 and real newspaper seven when people use to actually read you know that's crazy what comes to the mind I think what that is you can't take it that's what you want that was on spike which is a cable ten as you know and of course the word he says there was the was Smith but they even even on the cable channels not they bleaked out for the words because they don't know what's been and I was not kind of nothing with offended I want to like you find it at now you know even though it's on cable with you pay for the cable for those channels to come in your home you pay for me they come in over a you know wire the FCC's that absolutely no business threatening anybody the federal government that if you say smitter anything on the air we're gonna find your ass and it's gonna be a big big but even the cable channels are blip and crap on and brother trade on that's a project and not yet the later on and moving he did because oh in my room in my room are my children where my wife sleeps where my children play with their toys things like that remember that's he oh yeah the bro all of them but anyway hey remember Johnny Ola see that was the thing that was the one that the metal was he he that big it's had to know is he was just in for the wrong time and then as soon as he saw freighter with Johnny Ola yeah anyway Doug Thompson writes one of his really great carcums capital hill blue he says the verdicts came in Tuesday in the trial of former our vice president so chief of staff Lewis scooter liby killed the unforefied counts and a perfect world that would be enough to get Congress off its politically shy but and start in peace from proceedings against the corrupt administration president George W. Bush four guilty verdicts against liby is more than enough to warn impeachment the trial strip the way the cloak a secrecy for most to consider this white house a modern times if lying about a oral sex he can't read that from an intern provides a vision grounds for impeachment a previous president how can lying about taking the nation to war subverting the constitution out of structure justice not just by removing bushness kawal from office but whatever legal means necessary I guess I couldn't say VJ oh don't do that then we claim VJ Thomas music at the very least the liby trial of the of vice president vick chain workers traded a coordinated white house effort to destroy the lives of former vessator Joe Wilson and his wife covert c. eye-operative value claim in showcased extraordinary lengths in the situation with employee protected to manufacture lies used to justify illegal and more invasive of a rack the trial is supposed to win houses a veno prep criminal enterprise where political speedy replaced truth and american lives would be sacrificed to protect personal agendas. At the center of this criminal conspiracy such ch any in trial role Bush's brain the political guru with a president's ear built Clinton-boinked monoclements be He went to trial before the Senate for saying he didn't do the nasty, which he addicted far more but as many crimes pale on significance to the corrupt of the Bush administration Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment and certain conviction. Bush, however, means an office continuing to drive the nation toward disaster while the new Democratic leadership of Congress takes impeachment off the table and says we all just have to learn to get along. Enough. The limit trial documented and excruciating and exacting detail, the many criminal activities of a White House out of control, special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald says his job is done. In a single focus world it is. He was appointed nail somebody in the CIA leak case and he did so. It doesn't matter that living is the fall guy for the bigger fish. We needed a head on a platter and libys fits nicely. But the issue goes far beyond who leaked Valerie Plains' name to the media. It goes to the heart of a corrupt political administration at LINE, covered an obstructed to protect the use of falsified intelligence to justify a pre-planned world that is so far cost more than 3,100 American lives, along with thousands upon thousands of Iraqi civilians. When the Schmidt hit the fan of a release of Plains' name, Bush promised the American people that anyone connected with a superwoman be gone from the White House. Time for both to live around that promise. He should fire Carl Roe, he should take this step to the necessity to rule by President Dick Taney from office and then he should resign as president. At the moment, it is passed time to purge the White House of the Kansas and infecting body politics. In Bush had one shred of honor, one ounce of decency, or even one microna varnasty he would do so. But he doesn't. The relief was hoping that somebody else can step forward to take the necessary steps to remove his lying, criminal ass from an office he never deserved, and dishonest by his very presence. I know that chances for a sector are slim, too slim given the cowardice of Congress and assistant designed to protect crooks like George W. Bush. I can only take salvation into fact that on some day of the distant future, Bush's time will run out and he will meet his maker. I'll make day, they'll receive the eternal damnation he deserves, because not even God will be able to forgive the many sins of the 43rd president of the United States. But how do you really feel, Dougie Doug Thompson pissed off and fired up, baby. And you know what they say in the sports segment on the station, though, see if I don't find the answer.

Oh, being in 7, I wonder if that Billy Bob guy would have swastika over the 28 times. 27. Being in school actually growing something 25, my stamina 14. The Cold War, at least we knew who the enemy was 13 and real newspapers 7 out of 9. 49. Seattle Miss, so real loose papers that much anymore because first of all I got the Toronto Star and the Globe and Mail and the Sun which is a piece of right wing propaganda and the National Post which he's in more right wing and garbage. But before 4 daily newspapers and I'm shocking to you how many you got to. One for Broward, one for Palm Beach, one for Narangio, one for here and one for over there and also the Kraffin. And when you're okay like 700 daily newspapers when people, but now you don't need it because you can go online and read this stuff if you care about that stuff. Unless you're young, of course, what's like I said, all you want to do is maybe get stone, get laid and go on have a great time. Right? Right? And what's not to like about that? What's up? What's up?

There's a guy who found a good machine and vagus needs to go back this weekend to give the money back. Good. Well, I had a bad, I had a rough day yesterday. I started with the dollar machines and there was no OK for one and all the sudden it went to sour. And I had another one who was really sour. And I tried another one was really really sour. All man. It was like in sour patch kids. And then I went to the five dollar machine and sour wouldn't even begin to describe it. It was just one of those days. But it's only money. WQAM Hello. WQAM Hello.

When we come back from the break I've got a thousand and then Chris is going to be doing a Kizazuki up and down the hallway. You'll see. To him, hardaway. I hate basketball players. I don't like to be around basketball player. So biggest needs. So best talent. It's the big O-11 right away. They have senior 8 cast muscles. They're sweaty from going up and down and up and down. The hardwood all night long without getting tired. I don't want to be in the locker room with them or watch all of them in the steamy shower together playing. And a man just thinking about it. I'm thinking about it right now. And... Wow. Never mind. 117 at 5.60. WCM. Before the show today, George was telling me all kinds of stories about freaky carl service receptionist who's behavior. Just who's very existence is unacceptable. Just on the face of it. Yeah. But it's behavior evidently is much worse than ever anticipated or that's another good reason for me not to be there. Hey, it's all comic relief. I always say really. I think I have the stomach court. Now this fact that you just said me here, did I talk about this like two weeks ago about Giselle Wunchen is pregnant and allegedly by Tom Brady. And then we had that one that facts that came into that article. That was a fact. Yeah, but who was that? He was a clean cut guy. You know, yeah. Things like that. You don't have sex with your girlfriends. Just remember that. Think, guys, I'm playing the old slide of Solami routine. Okay. So let's get serious. Okay. There. There. What? I want to stupid comment. I thought he was a clean cut guy. So in other words, clean cut guys aren't supposed to be having sex. Is that what that's supposed to mean? Yeah. Jesus, God. There's only one kind of guys that I know who aren't having sex with her girlfriends and that's right. And Brazilian website before you yesterday, the Tom Brady's girlfriend, she's up Bunchen, maybe pregnant. And if so, the Patriots quarterback is the father. Here's something for your father. Currently, popular celebrity website. What does that say? GM orama.com. .br. Wulchin would be no more than two months pregnant, but may already have told select friends and family. The brief item was written by Joyce Pasco, which, who does the resident equivalent of New York Post Richard Johnson? Oh, I can't say Johnson. Brady's agent, Tom, he did not return a phone call on Bunchen's representative to not report. Two weeks ago, Brady's ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget One, and all this is a different one. Oh, I see. I'm confused. He was me. Yeah. I think you'll track all these young ladies that he's impregnating. He was me. Nice going. Tommy. He's busy. He's a busy beaver. Well. Two weeks ago, Brady's ex-girlfriend actress Bridget One, and revealed that she's pregnant and prays, Brady's the father. He wants to be like George Washington. He wants to be the father of our country. What's wrong with that? At a boy, Tommy. One, and hands representative, at no comment on the possibility of a Bunchen baby. Brady, 29, morning, and 30. What do you think that this agent is likely to have a little more common sense? They be doing like a little bit of something, a little protection there. I mean, there's all these pills and devices and things, you know? Wait, maybe what's that, a boot, baby? Brady, 29, and 1, and 36, dated for nearly three years before breaking up in mid-December. Soon, after the two times Super Bowl MVP began dating the Brazilian Supermodel, they pretty peer recently enjoyed five star stays in Paris, Milano, and Al-Hola, and Life at the Star Week, they've reported that Bunchen also took Brady to meet her parents and Porto Allegro Brazil. Porto Allegro, excuse me, I think. I can't read this. Bunchen, who's dated, aww! Bunchen, who's dated Leonardo DiCaprio, and Sirford Kelly Slater, who is also dating your favorite, at least favorite, the bitch Pamela Lee. Recently, told Vanity Fair that she's like to have children, but she's no hurry. Surprise! I'd be lying if I said I didn't want a family, but my parents have been married for 35 years and I have six children. She said, think as I'm just 26 years old, so I have plenty of time. She said. Although, apparently, look at this, I guess Sean is really upset about the Charlie B, because Sean just came out of the closet now, and here's a couple more pools. Thank you, Sean. You're still a career, I'll book, okay. I'll take a back seat to anybody. Although, I was 30, was in the back seat there, and he forgets that he didn't know what was going on. He didn't feel a thing. Says, Muscle Tavern, you're right for the lover Christ. Don't forget to begin an exercise, Regimen. Oh, and as Sean, Jesus, don't forget to begin an exercise, Regimen. Right. You're doing a lot of leg lifts, aren't you? Especially now, that spring is near you. I lift this, okay? I was doing a lot of fat. I was doing a lot of tapping at woodbind yesterday, and Gordon is toughen. You're like it more than you think when you are in training, when you are in training, it greatly reduces the chances of, I mean, Sean, you must be here, and you were seeing me, Sean, and I am fat, old, fat, judo, who I am. Let me sit inside, ladies here, look at the mirror. Oh, Jesus, I'm picturing you in sweat with 808's, John, and Roy, but when you are in training, really, we do this is a chance of depression. I'm not the least with depression. I'm a very, very happy person. You know, ankle weights might not be a bad idea. Yeah, I got your ankle weights. That's for giving the Carlos, okay? Keep his ass on the ground. Anxiety, effective jet lag. I don't have an oven flat in Europe so many times. You have a big half-flon, a hundred times, two or four, less 20 years, where I go in 20 years now. This is my 20th anniversary. Not only I'm at 31st year anniversary on the year, but by 20th anniversary of my Europe trips, to Amsterdam, in Colon, in Berlin, and Hamburg, in Frankfurt, in Stockholm, and Helsinki, and Paris, in a role-mine Milano, in Belonia, and where else about that? And foot-ins, nothing like Europe, maybe. Let me tell you right now, all you people out there because it's now the eighth of March, and you know what people are starting to get ready to plan right now? They're starting to plan their summer vacations. And fall over and I'll say, I've got time off from there. Work in your answers, all. Italy and all of Europe, all the way to New York, man. And I know I just Western Europe, this Prague and Budapest, lots of places to go. Lots of things, lots of people to do. I mean, see, the goes on and says, oh, and also, when you exercise, improves Mr. Wibbley's staying power. You know, see, that's one thing about, I don't want to get too graphing at all this. One thing about the joys of being gay is that you don't have to worry about staying power. You don't have to worry about the myth of simultaneous orgasms, and heterosexual sex, which, of course, I guess, in that case, if you've got a good actress for a partner, it's just fine. You know, our bad actress, you think, well, who cares? Might as well get it over with anyway. Just part of the adjoys of the game is of being gay. As far as straight men, technically, you really need to actually as partly correct into aspect. Oh, you're going to hate Sean too here. All right, a lot of it. He says, of course, in carceration, will sometimes cause otherwise, for a man to turn to other men, the same way you guys stuck on a deserted island, will eat all the coconuts inside. This doesn't make him a vegetarian. That's a good analogy though, I like that. Any social work will tell you boys who are sexually abused by men, often repeat the abuse on others of the same sex. This is an acting out word of trauma. That's a different thing. Different category. Right. Okay. A different experience is repeated. Can I read Sean's thing here? This is the most serious thing, man. He just cannot control himself. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. You could sit there in a coma, the entire show, you're in a car, and a tariff you can't have a rational conversation about it, and you shut the other person up. But I'm reading you guys back too. We can discuss it when we're done. I want to keep discussing this area. I don't care. I don't care if they're straight. I don't care if they're by. I don't care if they're gay. I don't care if they're 85.200 workers' cow. It is a no, what difference is it make what label you put on somebody? Okay. If they're hot and they're ready. You know what's like, lower your head. It's hot and that's what I have. That's happening. These are our streams of circumsized stance. And I don't think it was what George was talking about, so Sean, he may have been rebelling against the gay fantasy this street guy. So my strikeout with the chicks at the night club will be lustfully seeking, I can't read boy ass that very night. That's bad. That's what he wrote. Gay guy's fantasized about doing this street guy. The same with the street guy's fantasized about a manager twat. That's right. And then it's been a couple of pulls. Okay. Sean, just calm down. Because some people don't like certain labels. Doesn't change the meanings of words. There are lots of big guys. They're not even doing the other. I like labels. I'm not interested in them. I don't care about them. So see I got confused about jiselle Bunchin and Bridget Moynihan. So evidently Tom Brady's knocking up everybody in sight. And he just, I guess, but I like that's what he wants. That's wrong with that. And you can just imagine how lovely those children are going to be. You know, isn't that what we should strive for in the world? Is that only the beautiful people reproduce and all the ugly people. You know, lots of lots of those sterilization will be good for a lot of people. I haven't mentioned that in a very long time on the show. One of the great concepts that I've come up with over the years and nobody will listen to me. But you know, zero population growth is fine. But the best way to achieve that is forced sterilization. Okay. Especially in South Florida. Not everybody, just most. Like the colors. 1,000, 13 votes on the poll. We're doing pretty good. We got over 1,000. You market that down. Chris, you on top of this or what, huh? Oh yeah. And when you begin, when are you beginning to your training program? Wow. He's doing all the best. Don't forget to begin exercise, read you. You've been especially now that spring is near. Well, what does that mean? What does that mean? I will say this. I walk more every day. One day here. Unless it's like two days ago when I almost never left the house. I walk more and one day here than like in a year down there. Because I don't have no car here. I have a fine location and I walk all over the place. At least a couple miles every day. And that's all you're going to get from me. That this old dude, that's as much exercise you've been to get from me. I'm going to be doing sit ups and push ups and we'll ease and car wheels or whatever else you want. Yeah. Just they could have happened. Oh, there's that debate from both us. Oh man. That's how I stand. Yeah. How do we don't hear no more about him, you know? Maybe because he's dead.

Now this person who said this, this was come over the fact. My sheen is always talking about forced sterilization. This has to be a psychic listener. Can you believe it? Neil, I love that Tom Brady story. It says he should be getting about it. He should be getting as much as possible out the human gene pool. You always talk about forced sterilization. Maybe he's a compromise that people had insisted having babies to be forced to use DNA from people like Tom Brady just to thought. There you go.

People are just the hour this boring hour That's it You're the one who's keeping rehashing this novel and all of you just brought it up I didn't and you did let most of that crazy I'm standing right there I'm talking with a rambling man You see you see Chris everybody here Will not let me get this Go ahead Just because some people who want to admit to themselves That they are bisexual that doesn't mean that they're straight Just because they identify themselves as straight Because it would be embarrassing Like the director's skin we were discussing the other day Two through five is bisexual Okay three is right in the middle A lot if you want to you got to buy it If you have the ability to engage in sex willingly With members of both sex as you are bisexual Lots of straight guys go to prison and don't have gay sex They are the straight ones Rate not with standing So just because somebody is a message Okay, because everybody's communicating with me I've got all three of my correspondence on here today Lots of bisexual guys And straight guys represent themselves as straight Would never admit it to anyone possibly even themselves That they are bisexual or gay See my philosophy is don't ask don't tell I'm asking you that you have a special with dance To where somebody is talking about all the straight guys I'm sure that's where I'm laughing you forced me to say to explain why I got me Chris is coming because you are getting so fond of this with her He says trust me Neo I'm calm that woman is just getting on my he was bitching about that What's your name again?

So we're all born What you're trying to do We're all born We're all born Just like Michael said to Vincent And godfather is like you Why are you doing that, what you are? And you're born that way and it doesn't matter what you later I said And it doesn't matter if you're embarrassed to identify yourself as a bisexual person if you have the ability to willingly engage in sex with a You know, hey, it's really ironic that you go through all this because generally speaking Uh-huh, and we talk about anything has to with gay you have a line. It's a good. It's a great line. You've been seeing it for years What's it to you? What's it to you? What's it? Who cares? I don't care in fact That's why the main reason is I don't ask because I don't want anybody to you know If if they're ready to a rock and roll that's fine with me I don't we need to need any identification. I don't like photo ID unless I'm worried about their age It's stuff like that. You know words have actual definitions and I know all that's Words don't mean so that's right, but they don't mean anything to me. You see I don't care. Well I don't care. That's fine, but some of us use words correctly And I like to Oh And some of us could pay a lot of money, but that's beside the point Okay, good money So I make mistakes. It would be my first mistake. Why make mistakes? It was a lot of fake a lot of fake No a lot of guys Plenty some gay guys want to play along with that fantasy because they you know, they think it'll cut into their action I don't have a fantasy of a label. Okay. I don't have that kind of a fantasy My fantasy would be that my friend from Berlin from last summer during the World Cup Which if I could draw you a picture you would a lot of you people would soon and fall on the forehead Say that can't be possible not you knew yeah, it was just one of those miracle experiences Okay, that would be my fantasy. Okay, is that I hope there's a knock on the door right now I hope in the door and there he is, okay Wabbling in here saying on with a little bit of love you'd saying a toothbrush and whatever else I'm the order I'm staying that would be my fantasy. Okay And I would say well let me ask you are you had a recessual are you one to six hundred record to skip I just say hey the show be over one thirty I wouldn't even say the show be over one thirty. I come running right back in here Say all I got a bad headache George you are the so started years ago because you were talking about how great it is to get a straight guy to have sex with you And I love you are you are crazy person. Okay. I talked about how great it was to get a few or some other things with another Fag run the W I would never said then I was like and I and I laugh and I hear what's so fire Said you'd never had never had sex with a straight guy and you got really upset and you still are to this day Let me put you this way Coming with like Tom Brady for example since he's in the newsies infregnity every slut in the I mean every Broad in the world. Oh, yeah, I would like when I looked at a sense with Tom Brady who's very head of sexual Yeah, as you gonna have sex with me. No, I'm never gonna meet Tom Brady. No, so who cares how great he quit? He would do in a pinch. You know I pinch it. I know a lot of people that are cheating on their wives But they would never consider themselves an adulterer because that would be too embarrassing So they called themselves monogamous, but that doesn't make it so I Think about we were very sorry. We were the person the other day too You're sorry. I had a cheeseburger. I'm gonna make it I would put faith in every piece of his food. I just have three words for you George remember the bird Wow Aren't you are two the guy that know I'm not but aren't you guys something?

We're annoying. Remember that song hot hot That's how this whole argument started anyone There's no argument. I don't care don't you understand? I care less about this than almost anything in the world because it's so It's so ludicrous hearing you sitting around there pontificating they after day about gay people and the sex that we have and who we're doing and who we're not doing and what they are Well, I don't care.

Q a m hello. I did No, it was me I can you read the news as it getting Congress. Okay Ha哈哈 Hi, gw, I better get back to the telephone directory W200 MO I think to Reverend George Hey gigabytes Especially she- Maria recordings exactly make up W 2 im. Hello my Oh, that's not your job. I don't know. He's been in here sucking around the last two days. He's looking to get the job back there. You're making enemies already. So good. Chris doesn't hear. He's getting free food in there, which he needs like a hole in the head because he's trying desperately lose weight and stay alive. If you want to stay alive, man, I'm telling you right now is a friend. I don't love you, but as a friend. Well, I mean, you know, how long was Josh on the show two years before we developed that special bond that's special love between a boardoff and the type of very platonic non-sexual kind of like. Yes. I have the effect that's the story of my life, but that's okay. I don't mind. 11.01 and before we made 1100 now, I've also got an hour and 18 minutes to go. Not that we're counting, okay. So, excuse me. I'm fucking bow. I'm down. I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone. I just left free half again. You can't make me sick. Though I have a problem. I'm crazy, you think I drink too much. I party all night until I throw up hope. Now I go for them, my hair. Lost my scent of reality. I'm crazy, crazy, just let me have again. I don't need their help. My name's not my hand. I'm crazy, crazy, you think I have problem more than just being done. It's called Insanity, yeah. Let me have again. I need more tattoo because I love the pain. I'm crazy, crazy, you think I have problem more than just being done. It's called Insanity. It's a bit about man. Crazy is a loon. Whatever that means. Why is a loon? Crazy, loon is a bit about crazy sound. Maybe. So, you do it. Have a loony tune. And what he would pack you in the box money. I'd say it's like a 20 sound too. Alma Fah. And it's so nice to have the care with that loony tune. Now they still have enough still have all those do they. I mean they're out there, but they're not making any new ones. Actually with our full day, that's one of the things I would like to go back is to being a kid. I used to go to number eight school and watch this. You're okay. In elementary school and kindergarten and first of all, it's second grade. And right across from the school was Louis Susman's new stand. Now, is that something I remember his name and I remember one year I mentioned on here. Oh, I remember Louis Susman's brother. It's like they got to talk about Steve Warren's brother. Who used to be the elevator operator at the golf street. Remember the hump or not used to talk about that all the time? Stop it. Yeah. Louis Susman was a guy and he had a a new stand back in the day. And it would tell you know, like still easing the, um, Fag gets some stuff like that. And comic books and baseball cards. And so when you were kid back in those days, that's the way it's been a lot of your time. We were fine condoms back in those days like now. Now, let's see how this is going. Well, I mean, this is an ongoing trick. I guess once it's on segment, one thing about the people online here that you get in touch with. You know, see all all of them. I don't think there's any exception. They all become hand-bones. You know, I mean, they're one of the celebrities. That's all. It's fine. I have no problem with that. We can use some good material. I mean, it's not as exciting as reading the newspaper, the phone directory. But then what is paper and plastic and aluminum foil? No, you see, you didn't understand what I was talking about. Did you with a tin foil? I don't have any problem sometimes. I mean, I don't have a problem at all the time. In fact, if I can get to a whole roll of aluminum foil, why don't I keep calling that everybody calls it tin foil? But that's where aluminum foil. Without like shredding like so it comes out like in little slices. I feel like I've already had a major conflict. There's my mother, but there's a me. Let's see. It says, if you're ever need a... And in other words, he's... I said to him about the line about winning back our money. I said, what time is yours, your one? He said, every other time you're a crew, he's it. And then he says, going back to your line, this whole business, because he's even more adamant than you are. He hates Tammy. Like, when somebody starts typing in camp of letters with the main information points, you know, they're worked up into a frenzy. No, not just because she's crazy. He's really funny. But he just hates your like poison for whatever reason. I think, you know, he's sucking up to you. I think he wants you. He's by, you know. And I understand. He hasn't seen you yet. Why can you see George? Of course you might change him. Nobody wants to see me. You're probably shut off his whole thing. What? I usually don't have bad sex because I'm just that damn good. It's what he said, but they're after a... Well, that's true. Bad sex is a rare thing. You know, how about that happened? No, no, I would not agree with that. There is such a thing. There is such a thing. There is such a thing. There is such a thing. There is such a thing. There is such a thing. There is such a thing. There is such a thing. And of course, now see, I was so surprised. I understand some talking about with a partner. I guess so. I guess so. Yeah, because he says, I don't because I'm just that damn good. It doesn't make any of us how good you are. But if you're... and of course that also goes back to the thing I was talking about in the last hour about the difference between gay sex, which certainly leaves many more. Oh, what's the term I was going to use? I don't say openings, but that's a very bad choice. No, that was a bad choice towards options. There's a lot of mechanical options. I suppose to the desperation of the simultaneous orgasm, which, you know, back in the day, of course, before all this women's lived, you guys didn't give a crap about that. It isn't the simultaneous orgasm. It's just getting them to have one. Yeah, well that's what I'm saying. Yeah. As opposed to the guys where we know it's all very easily accomplished. And that is correct. There are... we have these. John, it goes right. I thought you didn't think I'd get back to this, without this sex topic I got going on. Here I feel like Dr. Root, or at least sold enough, for my folks to impeach Bush and Shaney. All right, now we're talking heavy duty. Are you cracking your knuckles again? Yes, I am. Why? That's our crack expert. What a hell, I missed this thing goes on. Oh, brother. Why? I'll get it in there. I'll read as much as I can, and I'll chop myself off. So to speak. Now for my Governor Jim Douglasard Republican, with reasonably close-sized President Bush asked if there was any additional business to be considered at the town meeting who was running in middlebury for a month, Ellen McKay popped up and proposed the impeachment abortion-wise president Dick Cheney, to which we say, Oh! The Governor was not amused. He's a Republican. As moderator of the annual meeting, trying to suggest that they proposal to impeach along with another proposal with Roy U.S. troops from Rekhanaphi, voted on. But McKay, a program coordinator at Middlebury College, pressed her case. And if soon became evident that the crowd at the annual meeting, shared her desire to hold a present to a council of Douglas back down. It became clear that no one was going home until added a sense of disgust to resolution and vote of them, explained David Rosenberg, Rosenberg, a political-san professor of Middlebury College, and being a good politician, he allowed to vote to happen. By an overwhelming voice vote, Middlebury called for impeachment, so, if Scotland is weak, a town begins across from our most of which were held Tuesday. As Bruce Williams would say, Tuesday, and why he says that, I have no idea. Probably because he's an A-hole. Late Tuesday night, Tuesday night, there were confirmed reports that 36 towns had backed impeachment resolutions and almost expected to rise. In one town, Putney, the vote for impeachment was unanimous. I want to say that was named after Channel 10's Michael Putney, who's a nice guy, but as boring as, oh, listening to paint dry, not even watching it, just listening. And additionally, Governor Douglas's middlebury, the town of Harlan, which is under Congressman Peter Welfth, backed impeachment, so to the Jericho, while I'm under the walls of Crumblandown, home of Gay, Simonton, what kind of a name is the gay? The speaker of the Vermont House report of G.A. Y.E. That's a female. I know that's why I spell it. You smell it, nice spell it. Organizes as grassroots traffic at town meetings to back impeachment resolutions, hope that the overwhelming support the initiatives received, will convince Welfth to introduce articles of impeachment against Bush and Cheney. That's something they democrat a Congressman's resisting, even though as predecessor Bernie Sanders signed on last due to a proposal by the government, the government, the government, the government, congressman, John Conner, to set up a house committee to look into impeachment. Well, you realize we just got an hour to go to the awful basketball here at all. I feel really cheated today, not. And then, of course, tomorrow is payday, not. And Chris is not too happy, so he's stubbed. Why are you up here? He has a mirror. Yeah, if I was as bad as you are, man, I'd have difficulty seeing mine. And, in fact, even now, I'm, from my act, I also want to legislate through the poor articles of impeachment before them to congress, the Simington, also a Democrat, as the Scourge Initiative, despite the fact that more than 20 representatives of course, prompted impeachment resolution, Spinalist Democrats, man, there's another one for you. Gay, Simington, no one of the color. Gay. You know, as you ought to be hard for Peter Welfth and gay, Simon, to say there's no cinnamon for impeachment, now that our towns have voted for it, since Dan B. Walt of Newfane, Vermont, town select man who started the impeachment initiative last year in his town, and not pants to launch a campaign to pressure Welfth and Simon, from respect and reflect the will of the people. It's going to be even harder for Governor Douglas, who just this month spent two nights at the Bush White House to face his president. After all, Douglas Nell is in town that's on record in the fort of Bush's impeachment and trial for high crimes and misdemeanors. And it goes on and on about all the different parts of the resolution, about a beat for the, John Nichols' new book, by the way, the genius of impeachment, the founder is cure for royalism, and that's something I better go out and get there right now. I also got to go out and get the, borat DVD. No, an acidity, an expat. Oh, you're going to send it to me. What a guy. See there he is. He gave me a whole solid answer. Are you going to like crazy? Saying remember the bird, remember the main? Is that what you said? Remember the main? That's right. Remember Marjorie main? Marjorie main. Were you going to be 100 years old to remember that old bag? Who? How about what's your name? The head of the T bag hanging from her hat? What was your name? Many pearl. Many pearl. Very good. You see that was a private robber. They've had him on their old day for quite a lot. And in fact, I would say right about now he looks really ready. Spread of Clark and a manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a genie appears. The genie says, I'll give you each just one wish. Me first says the administrative clerk, I want to be in the Bahamas driving a speed both without a car in the world. The genie snaps his fingers and poop. The woman disappears. Me next says the sales rep. I want to be in Hawaii relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse. And then let's supply opinion. Kalamaz and the love of my life. The genie once again snaps his fingers and poop. Gone. Okay, you're up next. The genie says to the manager. And the manager says, I want those two bag and the office after lunch. Paul. Paul. Good day. Good day. 1231 and 56. He's got a QAM. We're a little long signal song. Can we? I say let's make a vow. Okay. Let's have our vows. Sure. A play music. 258 friends by the way, our space page. We're going to, I think, what we'll do. We have a goal on there like a 2000 will be phenomenal. I'm going to show it on. Well, I mean, it's going to be a long way. So yeah, 2000 will be such a spectacular number. But nevertheless, maybe Johnny G. can go out and find some friends to put on there. Johnny, get any friends? Oh. When he valve blues baby, fifth to pitch in Maryland with cool. So I think it's a good pause. She could cool. Koo-choo. By the way, Chris wants to set you up with some object. He's married. Sweet. He's married. Maybe like, she's sick as to. Some object in Miami. He can do a fast-getting question. Straight, the dyke by just letting send a bike. Chris. Match. Make her match. Oh, did I say bye? Anyway, we're not going to discuss that on the show. Okay. It's just ponders. I mean, you've got your thing about your, you know, Adam and Milton and Tammy, of course, is diametrically opposed. He's like hysterical about us. And I just, I really don't care. I don't care. Okay. It's of no consequence to me. Okay. I'm not interested in labels, in words. I'm a man of very few words in those kinds of situations. I'm not interested in words. Okay. More interested in deeds. Remember Mr. Deeds goes to Washington. Mr. Deeds are going to send him up there for a Chris. If you don't watch your ass, he might take care of it. Never less. Okay. Let's get back to what we're doing. What we doing? We're killing time. Fifty minutes till basketball time. Is there anybody in this audience? Okay. Here's a great idea. Because these people have nothing to talk about today. There's nothing going on. There's a lot of dead people in Iraq and more dead soldiers and stuff like that. But they're so used to that. Fine. I've only been like, like, fade that away. Said network. They've shot themselves. They've, they've, they've shot themselves up. And they don't care anymore. Remember that scene? Yes. Yes. Well, that's America for you know. People are just beaten down to a bloody pulp. So I'm saying what we got to do is find out how many people are going to be listening to the hurricane basketball game at 130. I want to freaking 130. You women, Merlems, the ACC chairman from Tampa with the beast and Clarence and Joe's a Gaki. Terrors are Gaki. Fuck. Okay. Oh. And what device are you going to use to measure this? We're going to take a survey on the phone. What are you laughing about? Okay. I want to find out from an audience. They're going to be listening at 130 or if they're going to be turning that dial. Or maybe just going to take a nap or taking a cold shower. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound, 5, 60 in the horizon. Well, this is kind of interesting. So it's like over and above our regular poll. So to speak. We got the regular poll going on on the side. And how many votes we got on the regular poll? Chris, we got 1134. Well, we're going to make over 1200 today. Eat more of the short show. I guarantee it. I'll bet you Chris is life on it. Okay. So we got, oh, you know we're going to do that. We got almost an hour to go. We can't get 66 votes in an hour. What kind of a dump? Don't be 800 pound weekly. Okay. Now we should have as a, as a, as a, Frankie Pan tangibly would say, have some fiduci, which means have some faith. Without that means fiduci. Yeah. Sounds filthy. My father used to say that all time fiduci. He was a jackass. My father. A relation to darn fiduci. Yeah. John fiduci. W. Hello. Okay. But now he would, would you rather listen to us or the game?

They look for me. I'm just a sense of there. There you go bouncing Jessica as George is remembering those days when Jessica was sitting right across the table and he can't reach him. I'm trying to grab a little something from so. I mean the left that he is. Or she was actually very nice. So with nice I'm sure she was very nice. I wish Nick would be sitting across the table for me right now. You know it's interesting. Remember that Alan guy has mother called out one time and he started that. The my space thing for celebrities whatever it was I figured with the name. Right. Whatever it is. And Nick let's say is one of the people on there and he said I'm going to get Nick in touch with him. And at one time I got something from that Alan guy that was kind of like incoherent and make any sense and with something about Nick but it wasn't really Nick. There was somebody talking I don't know what it was. And when your big star like Nick you know you can't be bright and there's slupper. He would write to me. I mean if Johnny that was right in the Johnny G then certainly Nick is going to write to old. I was pretty sure I'm trying to come up with my music going to the ball game. Oh I know what my B. We have a vocal step on. We'll be good. Al Martino. One half. So small sea. It's a little amount of money. I got to update my money for that. Yeah there you go. A little amount of money would be good before it again. But everybody will come up. It will be probably about two or one maybe one thirty one. What was that? So, again passed the line. So, it's really on. Pass the line is this when they were walking around with the sheep and the balloon. Yeah. Body guards at the shotgun. I'm not rather heard that. But that's you know. Yeah. Or that. This one sounds so much more honest. Some of them were ominous. A seabull. She used to be the traffic lady of Diane Z. I'm this. What a memory. Oh yeah I like this. But it's very shit. It's like George. It's very short. So if I was you I keep your eye peeled for a email for my buddy Chris. Oh I love this. Now here are small. Maybe if you want the diff is small. So not quite much small. So just general plan will every day eat a few smalls. This is it. With a bunch of glasses. This is it. With a bunch of glasses. And the juice for my army of highman. Maybe that's where they got the smalls from all the cities. That was from highman Roth. What do you think? They beat or maybe from Oogas. Or I thought we was kicking back in that chair there. It's Lord. I'm enrolcing the light up there. Yeah but then when he took his shirt off and I once seen we saw him back in a couch. We don't want to see a 90 year old man with a hairy white hair just. Oh, I mean I don't care of what persuasion you may be. Although Pat Bluen said friendly persuasion. Did he? He did. He's saying friendly persuasion and thought workers in my fight. I bet you have that in there. Friendly persuasion. I don't know if anyone got Moody River. I like that moody river. I must confess that back in the day I love Pat Bluen. I hit him like poison physics. He's the right one. We religious phony. Ever could go a piece of crap. There you go Moody River. What I'd say? 1958, 50 meh. Somewhere around there. 60. Ok. I said. I was like, do you work? Sorry, I was getting up to you. You chop me short. So he's a good man. Ok, so I'll kill him. Beat Bluen. Pat Bluen. a book twist 12 and 20 and don't do this and don't touch that and don't take these things and man in the meantime he was doing everything that move pad boon. Would like to have done him back then, this matter of fact, but I can't say that on the year because it sounds very gay. 1,07,05,16,17,17,17. Kill your honey. They're breaking their rotios, the gody family. You wear a six-pensive attire, you toss a muil, like a sire. You ride with a spintire, the gody family, sand with a mole. Kill your ass, kill your gang, the nose, tell you the truth. So leave a little bit. Where? If you think you are tough, there's people that you'll make stuff. You won't find things on the rough in the gody family. From an attempt to one at five, 60, WDK, we're only 18 minutes away from that big, gigantic U.M. Maryland, the ACC training. I won't think it can be on the espionage or something Chris wanted to be on TV. Who knows? Come on, let's not have a set of specary answer. I thought you were really training with corny, they were kissing my ass. I mean, whenever you were doing it, I mean, I can try to find out, but I'm trying to find out. Listen to me. Listen to me. Like Howard Beale would say. Listen to me. Television isn't the real truth. Okay, heard us. I'm a herald.com. See, remember today that what's his name, Bale.leftown? I don't see. I just know I'll be watching it or see it because I'll be at U.M. What do you mean by that? Spring practice football to go down there. I'm ready to host Augustine Tumargo dies. I have no idea who that was. Do you think we better talk about that? Who? Augustine Tumargo, the gravelly voice fast talking Spanish language radio commentator. Known for his passionate insightful analysis of local politics, Cuba and Castro died last out of a heart attack he was 80. Jimmy thought it was for no was supposed to die. Tumargo might as well own show on a radio mom B. 710. 65. When the station premiered. 710. 710 used to be. You can talk to Ken Walden about WDGS. To show you how to demographics to the market have changed. Used to be the grave WGS 710. In fact, it's a 710 berkel avenue. Are you worried? No. Isn't that ironic? They're 710 on the dial. They're throwing that. What? Coincidence. And get out of it, coincidence my ass, my pimple yes. Anyway he was also a regular on Mesa Revolta a roundtable discussion. I watched the main topic was usually Castro and Castro still alive and now this poor guy Augustine Tumargo. He's dead. Now what am I looking for? Sports. Okay. I hate to do this on the air but I mean Chris leaves me no choice. You leave me no choice, man. Let's see. Let me go ahead. Sports. Sports. Oh, I'm glad I said that. I'm at turn. Let's see. You have an FSU to go for a tournament. The Bupupupah. I need to go for a tournament and I'll see what it says here. This is the hero to keep in mind so it might not be easy to figure out. Where's the thing where it says radio and TV and what's on and etc. And so on? Can't find it. Oh God. Let's see. Colleges. UM. Okay. UM. Basically you want baseball. We're going to care about UM baseball here right now. We're talking about the hoops, man. Hoops. We're going to hell is it? Watch. Listen. Think. Hurricanes. Basketball at a glance in your pants. No chance. Like romance. No, seriously. I just, all of a sudden about 10 minutes ago, my brain snap back into place. My life's baked. No, seriously. My life's based lunacy just all of a sudden. I just find it. I just realize, no, seriously, people have a life. People live their lives. People are in terrible live their lives. Everybody have a great time. That's why you know what I'm saying? I'm going to start right now. So I don't want to wait for 10 minutes. Why? To start having a great time. I'm going to line up that brain now. Right now because I'm just baking my way through these final minutes. I can't find it. This newspaper man on a scale of zero, what kind of garbage is this? What kind of swirl? Like I said, you better find out from somebody who's on TV. They're not going to tell you. They think we're going to tell you if it's on TV. Like any of us, we're going to of course it'll be on somewhere. If it's the ACC term, you think that isn't going to be on television somewhere. Mr. You must be dreaming. You must be in a dream world. Let's see if I can find it here. I'm going to look for the Sun Center because that's where I found out about what's his name, Saben leaving. Okay, that day. Remember that day? How a birthday. We were saying, everybody. All of our big hot shots for us people. And I get the scoop on it because it was on the Sun Center. Saben and I was just leaving. Okay. New evidence cited in the lay of release of autopsy in death of end in the course myth. We don't care. We don't ever hear about that slut again. Forget about her. University of Miami. Okay. I'm clicking on right now. I'm a Sun, a slum, Sentinel. ACC hoping Florida fans will take note it says. Whatever the hell that means. Now we're at a sea. New hurricane coaches got new rules that suffer ball. Where the hell is the radio and TV stuff? Where is it? Can't find it. Please tell us, please. Pretty please. Not inside the building. Can't find it. Can you find it? No. How about the information? I'm looking. I'm looking. I can't find this. University. Well, that said I made my effort. I tried. Sun, Sentinel, and there. We can't find it. Sorry. Maybe somebody on the phone will know what you think. WDQAM. Hello. Good afternoon. Yes, sir. Is that K-Mont TV? No. I didn't hear what you said. Okay. Go ahead. First of all, how was your trip to wood賣 yesterday? Horrible. Horrible. Just wrote, test. Bad, really bad. No good machines. No good machines for this kid, man. No. Okay. Earlier before I left my car to watch, you mentioned, oh my God, by longer, radio accident. Bruce. Oh, I'm really okay. Yeah. Oh, whatever. Bruce and I said no, right. Tuesday. It's Tuesday. He was horrible. He was horrible. I used to actually hopped in mid-Ada. Many months radio accident, listening to him before I discovered you had been a loyal listener ever since. Okay. Thank you, sir. Have a good day. And you too, have a good life. Here's a fact that says, let me get this for you. I gave those in her K-Mont TV. I said, Rosenstein, Prince Burgh, Schwartz, I know the other stage. That's a tough one. I'm going to listen to the sound of nails being scratched on a blackboard. Wow. How do you like that for a real shot? Nails on a blackboard. And Sid Rosencrans teamer. Or Hurricane's basketball. Maybe the worst of all. Hey, sound that you. Hey. Yeah, like the sounds of some horrible sporting event pre-empty, Michelle. Not that I'm complaining. I'm delighted. I can start working on my lunch right there. 130. 18. 12th quarter will be on FSM. Fox Sports. No, I'm so worried. Of course, I'll be on TV. It'll be on TV here even. I could watch it. Do you think I'm going to be watching that crap? No. You bet you sweet life. I'm not going to be watching that garbage man. Clarence, my ass with all of it. But the contracts is, you have cars. Of course, that's part of the other additional wonderful stuff. I do these sports teams is that they sign these contracts. What if the sports teams are playing outdoor with a bunch of 10-year-old kids? And the game actually means something to them. If we have to carry it on the air. Hey, right. They should spot us a point in the rating. They should spot us 15 points in numbers. If we get a 7-year, they give us a 222. Is what they should give us. Don't forget the trends are coming out tomorrow. What time? 11. 30. Yes. See, I like to sound all whipped up about this because I know a lot of people out there are very, they didn't hate it. I mean, half an hour is in the air. The world, but like when the Marlins, back to the vision games on 12.50, that's two hours in 10 minutes that they're losing of this hour and 10. I'll sound them much either. Although we'll take it. I'm not knocking it. We'll take it. I'll earn 10 minutes. Where's my? Well, I don't forget please because nobody's going to know this. You're all going to get screwed up Sunday morning. Saturday night when you go to bed, turn a clock ahead now or daylight, saving time comes back early now. They changed the law. Canada, US, got to win those where else. Newfoundland. Newfoundland. Huh? Newfoundland. You saw that twice you go to Newfoundland. You know, Newfoundland is an hour and a half ahead of where I am right now. I know that's why I said that. What's the very last hour? We're soon in place in North America. They're talking, I'm not going to be this. Like a half hour of power, newfany. Or some idiots would say Newfoundland. What kind of a moron would say Newfoundland? Newfoundland. Newfoundland. 20 past one. If you want, we're going to get with it here because we got that big, big, big, big game coming up with parents, the main parents, Darrell. Oh, because she Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers. I remember one. There were a lot of people that thought I lost my mind when I said global change if we're going to play. Even polar bears in the yard, it could tell Earth was a warmer place. Hey, watch me dance now. Boom, check a little of the boom. And I was out there. No speech prepared and they called my mind. They said, out more worms were inconvenient truths. But that feeling of one does not compare with a feeling of standing next to Leonardo. He's cute. This Oscar's my baby. Oh, how far do I have to my baby? Oh, how far does Oscar my baby? Oh, how far? This documentary. Okay, once 25, you're going to begin the email from our buddy Chris sometimes. I'm kind of pushing on it because obviously you're, and he says, you sound like the poster child for not getting married. And I said, you are. I'm so willing to wreck the show. Yeah, so I said, it doesn't matter. I'm doing a series of lectures. Good idea. Okay, let's take a look at that pool. And then we're going to be out of here pretty soon because we got a very, very important thing coming up here in a second. The team is most about your youth. Twelve hundred and twice six votes. Not too bad for a short show. And for really marginal pull question, sex with young people my own age 234. Being irresponsible had no real consequences to a six. My body, 181. All my young, supple body. I never had one. Real music one, four. My hair, 84. Being single 82. American Americans are, were mostly like to broad. 66 years ago, they liked this once upon a time in America. Being ignorant as an ignorant as a blitz oblivious 51, I hate this pull 49 3.9%. Well too bad. My stamina 41. Rio Radio 37. Being in school actually learning something 33. Segregation 32 racist best stop rose out there. The cold war because at least we knew who the enemy was 15. The Ruskies, Kamalista, Kamalista, Kamalista, and real newspaper 11. 12. I guess there are probably a lot of people in South Florida think they really have real newspapers to which I would say, oh yeah, make no mistake about that. So this has been, let's see we took we had 20 votes on it and in a real quick mini pool 16 said it was actually only 19. 16 19 said, are you kidding me? We're going to be listening that stuff. But it's very important. It's I don't know why. Don't you think it's important? I mean like the regular season, gave us this anybody go, they built that new arena there. Anybody go to a mall? Thousands of empty seats. They needed that arena like the, as my grandmother was saying, Dr. Saviour, lock and cup. You know what that means? The means you need this like our whole and the head. Dr. Saviour, lock and cup. I'm going to tell you man, the joys are here. It is a great, you know. Once her show starts. You know, she, well, I'll double dig her up. She was a panic. She was really funny. If you think my mother was funny, I had ran away with my other side and a solemn and I told her the name was a new village and they changed it to Solomon because they didn't want to be so conspicuously Jewish. Now, what I want to make is also made that story. They say, ha, what a lie. And I want to hear as your mother and your grandmother having an argument. No. No, what you want to hear was my mother and my aunt having an archmobile boy. That would really be special. My aunt, the reader who's still alive by the way, in the hell and Dale. And I know I never, ever again, I got that one, not figure a couple of times. I got email from my, my cousin's kid who's like 20, 9 or 30 whatever right now. But third man. The Christmas time. And I responded and he listened and he says he listens for the earphones on, gritting from the ear to ear every day and just really excited about this show and being a related to me, although distant. And I never heard from him again. Huh, maybe find out you were, you know, Jewish. He, he believed me. Trust me, you think anybody listens for this show for five minutes is no, okay. Oh, we still get those calls every night. And I'm out in here. People still ask me away. So, but it just has to be guilty of it. One, and I really, really get it. He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he there he he no he he he he he very far he he he he's zero if he done he The preview from 6th to 7th of the Panthers of the 12th hold off of your flyers. In other words, between now and till because then in CSP and radio after that, in other words, till tomorrow morning, bye everybody. To the entire staff manager of WQM, will wish you a pleasant, good evening, Moana Santa. I believe in America. Good night and may the good news be yours as Ralph Redneck would say if he were here today. Good night, and may the good news be yours as Ralph Redneck would say if he were here today. Good night, and may the good news be yours as Ralph Redneck would say if he were here today. Could we forget?! Oh incredibly great. This is Christ. Your music isn't fading away, isn't? It's 130. I know.
