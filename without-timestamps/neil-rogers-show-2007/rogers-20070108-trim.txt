Sure. How do you do that? Well you can help me with that Since you're the technical wizard Right Anyway, getting back to this I don't want to get all whipped up about this Because what's the point? Nothing is ever going to change with this effort There isn't for that long time ago If you want to see any commentator Any talking hit on TV who really tells the truth And tells it like it is and said a big gigantic pair Then he's the guy in MSNBC 8 to 9 TM on countdown nightly Keith Olderman MSNBC I know most of you under the age of 100 don't watch MSNBC And certainly hopefully don't watch CNN And I'd probably like to like both bloodscree That crap 700 main reason I listen to you is For laughs To the 90 think because in honor of the fact that everything is technically so screwed up Since they listen to the laugh I'm thinking I think he I can put that like an end of you And this group group group, I think there you go right Huh?

I'll drop out again and back up and nobody can listen online. Very good Joe, you're really doing it. You and I crack engineering staff here. The bees lay production baby. I'm not holding anything back anymore. These people are a joke. They're an industry joke. They're an insult to my intelligence. I have to work in the business for about 100 years. I've never seen so many people with such little professionalism. It's schlach, you know? Fish are often a morning and fake your way through the day and schlach your way through life. It's a schlach house. 59 drafts, 750 votes on the poll all the numbers all the time. WQAM, hello. Yes, I'm sorry I just showed off the radio. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I had so much excitement and pleasure after viewing the Patriots win yesterday. I was on that final play, the return to reception for touch now. I'm Brady. I had that defensive back in his lunch and I said, oh my, would you be all right to open there? Yes. Good thinking pal. You're right on target all the way around. Would I like to be in Tom Brady's arms? You bet. I wouldn't mind being in a Ryan Phillips arms and I'm moving. I saw last night. I never mentioned that on the air. I saw what you did last summer. I know. I saw who you did. I know who you did last. I know who you did last summer. And a Ryan Phillips case really would be a long list. He sure looked good in that movie. Man. He wouldn't talk like this. He looked like a real hot punk. He looked like a white-bought movie. He wasn't talking like that at all. Who else was in that? What's his name was in it? Pretty Prince Jr. He looked pretty good too. You know, somehow he's liked him. I thought he was like kind of a... I don't dislike him as much as I wanted to. I'm talking about how he looks. I'm talking about his acting. He's adequate. He's okay. I'm really sorry about the fact that we aren't streaming our show right now. And haven't been for many minutes? No. Well, why not? Well, just weren't told him. We'll all go back up again. 62 draft outs. But we're back up. Who did you tell Josh? No, he's out of the room. He's out there screaming and yelling and banging on the door and engineering. You morons. What are you doing to the new Rogers? You're like, you idiot. You lunatics. But you know, you had it right when you suspected it. It probably wasn't on anyone's end. It wasn't on anyone's particular end if you know what I mean. Like something wrong with the line again. I'm a streaming you're talking about? Yeah. Are you sure? No. I wouldn't put anything past that bunch of... I mean, the fact that we go through an entire day last week. In a major market radio station, we can't send a fax. We can't send a freaking fax. We can't send a fax. We can't send a freaking fax. Jesus Christ, they're going to have to get us a new building. You're close to kinko's or staples or something like that. What a kind of goofball, huh? That's a good idea. Maybe if they moved it downstairs or something. That kinko's. If they moved what downstairs? Like, what is downstairs? No, the credit unions gone. What was downstairs now? It was empty for a long time. Just now they remodeled it and they got some world financials, something... I bet they got a fax machine. Probably because it works too. The deadest office downstairs too, probably. And I bet because the deadest has no office too. WQAM hello. Neil. Yes sir. I love your show man. I'm all for science and research and stuff, but the cool thing. I can't figure why. Why do they want to clone animals? I mean, don't we have a shortage of chickens and cows or something? No. I don't know what's going on. I really love your show. And could you play that thing? Could you be the girl from Nipas' Nima? The girl with Npas' Nima? You got a pali. Thank you Neil. Okay if you got him a smoking baby, and he has a faggot too. Done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, done, that's... Let's see, let's see. The world, the girl with Npas' Nima, who's coming up? Coming up by any moment. I might play a filter or a clock because I'm so nauseated and disgusting with all the stuff that's going on there. Hey Smokey Joe, let me tell you something man, you have really changed my altitude a lot. And a stir with that really crappy lunge too. That's steak. I wouldn't feed that steak to my dog if they were still alive. That would've eaten it though. That's the problem with it. Oh, he would've still not died. My mother killed tiny. You know that. Yeah. Every time we come back from vacation, that dog would have pink retiders, and he'd have that look on his face. By the way, if you guys all stop trying to facts that article about Jared Lido, it's not coming through and it's just tying up the machine. She's got an article about Jared Lido. I want to see it right now. No, no, that's not. Jared Lido naked right on his face. I want to see Ryan Frelip. Now, see that movie was 1997. So that's my right about that. So that's it. I'll tell you where to go. So Ryan Frelip was like 22 when that movie was made. I'm going to tell you, he never looked better in the history of his life. At least I never seen. He looked pristine and clean. And he was speaking like, yeah, I'm supposed to be like a punk. I'm not talking like this or anything funny like that. He, he looked good. I'm coming over saw that before. So Ryan was teens, screen was probably why. Yeah, it was okay. I mean, it was way overdone. And you know, the Zigden Zag. But it was kept you kept you, you know. And then of course he he dies toward the end. But then again, so there's almost anybody else on that movie for you. Who doesn't die is pretty pretty junior. Yeah, and the one chick, what does that who was in it? Jennifer love you. Jennifer loves Sarah Michelle. Yeah, they're. They're. And the two of them were young and pristine with big, uh, shape, uh, Yeah, a couple of boobs. So there's something for everybody in that movie. I saw who you did. I know who you did last summer. Can you imagine that God, I'll might talk about Ryan Frelip. He could do anybody he wanted to basically. He's one of those people in a, There are a few people like that, not too many. Who could do just about anybody they wanted. You know, like Brady Quinn Tom Brady, the Brady bunch. Alice, WQA and hello. QA and hello. Hey, if sorry, I'm your computer. Or you're a taxes. I, I got, I have the same thing in my computer. Went to our Jones dot com. Uh-huh. Yeah. Maybe that's where that smell is coming from. WQA and hello. I'm drinking. WQA and hello. Keep going. QA and. QA. Hello. WQA and hello. Okay. WQA and line nine. Hello. On other things, I have to up again. It's going to stream things. WQA and hello. Oh, new to the juicy. Yeah, I did see. Yeah. Okay. That takes you all the calls for today. 800 and 6 votes on the pool. And I noticed by the way that the crazy colors are way down the list. They're not doing well at all. Can't imagine why. And by the way, thank you so much, Joyce Fitzgerald for your tremendous cooperation to help make this show of what it could be. Okay. To help make it a shadow of what it should be and could be. Because this is the company that refuses to cooperate. We always have this adversarial relationship because they just, it's not that they can't, but they won't. They won't do it. They won't lift up pinky finger, man. And by the way, we're still up and we still like that 62 dropouts. And he liked that. All right. So maybe we've since Jack will have back there in threatened, a George Corsa with death. He threatened to bring out what's his name over from the West Coast. Bob Vermouth. If you guys can't get it straight, now we'll bring a real engineer over. Bob Vermouth. Now he sure did a great job. You should have seen him when he left an Amsterdam. The Dutch engineer guy thought he was going to kill himself. He just left. He just left a Mr. and as you recall, it didn't work worth a crap. Remember the one day I put Rimmer on trying to call me? Oh, yeah. I remember the day you tried. Yeah, Rimmer underwater. Which is not a bad idea. The main reason I listen to Neil is, for a laugh, 33. He's a freaking genius, 305. That's why he works for a bunch of Barbison aguyem with an IQ, the size of your little digit. Those bedtime stories only 39. To hear him suffer 34. Those crazy colors only 29. Want to hear that crap. Because on board 27, a break from all sports, 14. I hate this pool 13 and I hate Neil a dirty dozen. This is Neil Rogers. This is your boy. This is your boy. Good news. Let his head on. We have finally located weapons of mass destruction. It's Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney tried to help out. Next time, Charlie Guy with a helmet. He's so great to women. They shall jump on counter-scheme. But his fears is pregnant again. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have made a formal request to the world's journalist to leave them alone while they're in Africa. If pas help them have a good question. How would you know? Rolling Stones guitarist, Pete Richards, is recovered from a really bad weekend. You saw out of a tree and clashed in the F.C. all the same day. You know what? What about the sheetwave across the country? It's Al Gore, welcome, I'm going to tell you so. While we're playboy, time is at an occult Smith. Maybe pregnant. The bar Jones has been fired from the view effective immediately. Well, legal trouble for pasch, I'm like a Jackson. No, Gibson speaks about the night that changed everything. And as well in President Shulachana's calling, President Bush, the devil. What do you think of me? Then, law that had been a crush on Yikes, Whitney Houston, and it's the moment that pair of Milton died hard fans have been waiting for. Her debut album gets towards today. Florida Congress in Mark Foley, writing a book. The book will be about 400 pages. And how long the book is, but the book will be about 400 pages. The man who the rule, you, is the Crocodile Hunter, was attacked by a stingray. Whether the Bush was so angry, not for you, he's called our celebrities, not to adopt any children from that class. Family Anderson and Kidrock each filed divorce positions from one another. Pretty spares Kevin Federoined divorce could get even scarier. It's a new book called, if I didn't. OJ Simpson details how the killings would have gone down in G. Yeah, anything to do with them. My name is Baudat. In my country, they would go crazy. For these two, not so much. Little African boy Madonna is adopting a ride with a home today. Kid would little intimidating because when he got there, she was hanging on a cross. I'm very, very sorry to the African American community for the upset. I knew the last seven lemon shells that was in the get name. And as you as a turqueter, keeps her job Donald Trump this morning. Said he'd be fully intended to fire her today, but decided not to. Nicole Richie arrested for driving under the influence. Police say she was going the wrong way. Who are those discussed? I mean both insight and you take a look at it. She's a slob. She talks like a truck driver. While music fans around the world are dealing with a sudden loss. Music icon James Brown. The world is a great time. I can't hold the right side. I can't make the turn of time. The second world is a great time. We'll take a couple of kinds. You. A two of the kind. This sounds good to me. In fact, that work I buy one. I'll just smear it all over myself. It's 11.03 and 5.60. We're not to drop it out. Go more on the street. It's up. And it's a lot. Lots impressive. I think that's because Josh went out there and kicked him serious ass. He isn't carrying more now. Now that he's making a big bucks. That's right. He's not holding anything back. He said he has never in his life imagined even dreamed in his worst nightmare. Working with a bigger bunch of do nothing. Slime balls in a QAM. That's what we told me before the show. Tigger. You know, Tigger up in Orlando? From when he the poop? The bouncy side kicked the wild Disney world. When he the poo is in front of the log in. That ticker man. He's always been a problem. All the employees at Disney. Gay. A Disney employee applying the fame cartoon characters under investigation. After a new handshire family accused him of punching their 14 year old son during a home video session at Disney MGM Studios. You go, Tigger. I think that's a great idea. Some of these wise ass punk kids man just haul off and smack him. Is what I say. That a good idea. Right. You know, there's nothing worse than wise acre kids. You know what I'm talking about there? Do I know what you're talking about? Yeah, you do. Why don't you your kids are well behaved? Yeah, but it's the other people's children that really cause a problem. Because you know your kids see it and then they wonder, you know, why they're not a lot of behavior that way and then you have to hit them twice as hard. Oh, what keep doing it? I will. The orange County Sheriff's Office is out there. They said it took me forward from Jerry Monaco's senior. I wonder if he's kind to Joe Mar Sr. or Harold Fisher Sr. or Jim Merrimon's senior. A report from Jerry Monaco or a Dini Irvine senior. From Jerry Monaco's senior, sitting at Tigger's trucker's senior, he's on the head about 12.30 Friday afternoon. You vote, Tigger. Run your side, baby. He felt that Tigger was essentially punched his son and he filed a police reports and he had an attorney Carlos Padilla or is that Padilla? Remember that Jose Padilla who then be a yellow? Run a sheriff. Folksman. Right now the allegations that a battery occurred. Of course we see a little of that family video tape and we see what appears to be a battery. We need to talk all sides to see exactly what happened. Maybe Sally Fitzlawston, maybe it dropped out. It's a good point. Padilla or Padilla identified the man of the Tigger costume as Michael J. Fettelum. 31 of Kassimi. Oh, what a place because Simmy. Fettelum could not be reached for comment set or evening. Padilla said deputies have been to eat food on the new investigation as I'm going. Yeah, I had where the hell's that other comment? See, you thought that once I said I put that blog up there there would be 80's in the comments. That's what Josh told me. Well, we did it today. Did you just start doing it? Yeah. It's a comment.

The monocos couldn't be reached for comments Saturday at the Greenville Hampshire home, but the father and son told TV reporters, take you through a punch without provocation. At first, I thought he was just getting around and playing around them when he actually grabbed my arm jury, Jr. said. His father said their Disney vacation was marred, it did. You don't come here for this. I mean, Disney's supposed to be a safe place. It's supposed to be a place that you come in and drove with your family. At first, I was upset with my son. He said, I thought he did something to figure, hey, probably need him in the nuts or something like that. But then I reviewed the tape and it's pretty clear for just no reason you've clocked him in the face. How do you like that? He clocked him in the face. That damn figure, yeah.

Government contractors, CACI, cocky, international link. And there's a lot of bankruptcy court approval to proceed with this defamation lawsuit against liberal talkway. Do you know where Kaira America and one of its host Randy Rhodes. How do you like that? Oh, not the goddess. Oh, you vey. What? What? I'm a Randy. What? Are you listening to me? No. A federal bankruptcy court in New York rule Thursday. The case could proceed despite the fact that they are America's Fouper, chapter 11, bankruptcy production. Under federal law, legal proceedings against the company are frozen when the company declares bankruptcy. CACI, international asked the bankruptcy court in November to allow its case to go forward and argue that it claims against skeramer, her covered by an insurance policy. Any damages would be paid out of that policy and not from the company's assets. The company sued our American, its parent company, P.C. L.L.C. as well as Rhodes in the fall of 2005 for defamation. The suits then from comments she made August 25th and 62005 on a video show. According to the complaint she accused CACI employees of raping and murdering Iraqis of Indians at Abu Ghara prison claims that the CACI said were false and defamatory. They're seeking a million dollars in compensatory damages and 10 million imputed damages and air America's spokeswoman to climb to come in on the lawsuit. They got problems where it's skeramerica. U.S. district court dismissed the case, but cacky appealed that ruling. The bankruptcy court decision laws that they appealed proceed. Aero America declared bankruptcy October 13, but a company spokeswoman said last month it was supposed to reach a deal with a buyer. Our Clinton Virginia based cacky, cacky, is an information technology consulting firm against most of its revenue from government contracts.

Coming up tonight, we're inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story. They topped the charts with a upbeat little number about a very particular sexual fantasy. They didn't even give a crap that it was scientifically impossible. They were the winner girls. This song is an abomination against God. Reverend Peter Bence is a fire and grunge-dome preacher who believes the weather girls in 1880s. Isn't a fascination against God? I just said that. Sorry. For God has sent many planes rain from the sky. Blood, fire, even frogs. But for the sky to deposit men into the waiting hungry sweaty lowens of moistened harlocks is nothing but... An abomination against God. Testify a brother. Now I tell you if and I mean if the all powerful did decide to rain men upon this earth, it would not be a simple festival of lust. No, it would actually be very dangerous. It would go something like this. All right. The horror. And the weirdest thing brothers and sisters is that somehow this blasphemous old dephramis purity very quickly became an anthem for the homosexual. May I quote Corinthian 613 for the Prophet did say, the gaze like this thing go figure. The winner girls. If loving them as wrong, I don't want to be right. It's a big juice of sobbing with look at your business. Tonight on his side of the body. It's raining men and they all look like Ryan Khalifa and I know who you did last summer. Whoo.

Jump off the window. I'm going to eat my lunch right here on the ear since the jaw and your hand. It was usual. Well since we're all enjoying our fair while lunch for the first court of today. Maybe. Now is it for sure that tomorrow you're going to be out of there. What about Chris? How's Chris doing over there? He's doing good. He left. He'll be here tomorrow. Good job by Chris. Yeah, I guess. Wow. That did he get back? No Chris. Did we get him some food for his trouble? No, he didn't want any. I asked. Oh, he's not going to be doing a very good job. Anybody that is involved with this show and doesn't want to eat a lot of free food? What he looks like he's a lot of free food. Is he fat? Yes. Oh, no. Anyway, I'm going to be in a couple of weeks here in a minute. They're in the flavor wave right now. All right. And I got my French's mouth stirred here. My mouth is flavored wave. Every Saturday.

Nothing. Yeah, no, no, no, real. Because my mind is. You hear me eating every morning before the show. It's not standing. Now look. I was just going to ask you what conch kniter. What you can't get it there. It's Canadian. Oh, no wonder. Because every microwave bacon I get. Oh, it was stepped on there sucks. The only good one I found is Schneiders. And it's, uh, yeah, well, you'll come up here and get some. Or you just send some down. No. 924 votes in a full. I'm going to have a couple of weenies right here on the ear during the show. Wow, with my French is a yellow moustard. Yeah, the flavor wave is great. I use it almost every single day. Now what company did you get that from? I remember that one guy who was in the heaven and nervous breakdown at one day, like they're writing a book. Everybody's writing a book. That'll be a good book. Yeah. The good book says five six seven. Oh, five sixty. I may go out and get new one. When you hear that beep, beep, you know, how on the flavor wave is done. Cooking. And the good thing about the flavor wave is even when the cooking time is done. Yeah, it goes like, when the cook time is done, it's still the elements still stays on and it comes on every known and so it keeps the food warm on. Right. It is a fine machine. W 2 a m. Hello. I'm. W 2 a m. Hello. Q a m. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I was wondering. No, we're 12 is that the same one. Wow, could have fooled me. Well, Chris, you know, Chris actually fades in faster than you do. Remember when you are in vacation that week? Then, Tahoe. Oh, yeah. Think it like about a half a half a word out. It's like, they just disappear. Well, we'll have to make him the new board up of the show then. I won't wait. I'm going to go get my weenies. Do you like it? I don't know if he goes. So when we last left this conversation, you didn't know what office you were going to be operating out of. I think I'm going to put you in the bullpen. They've already got like bunk desks in there. I'm thinking maybe they're going to give me like a mini desk. And they don't be up against the wall. I see. You know, you could always use the other side of Alice in desk. Because I mean, she didn't think it could get any worse. That's what we're looking at. Guess what? Yeah, two people per desk in the bullpen. Oh, yeah, you're going to be sitting in somebody's lap and there. Double duty. You're going to be sitting in Alice's lap. Yeah, my monster here. Can you hear it? I can hear it. I'm thinking around. Now do you hear or do you dip? I swear it all over the wiener man. There we go. And then I take my knife and I like even it out. You know what I mean? Absolutely. So it's like nice and there we go. There we go. Clumping in. You know, I want to have a mustard deposit. You know, the good thing about the flavor while. And when you host something, you know, like this. Yeah. It's like it was cooked in your grill. Yeah. And the other good thing is that, you know, since it's clear and all lit up and you can see how far along your food is coming. It's nice and because some people that are very paranoid about raw chicken like like some of us, who got served raw chicken a lot as a kid. Thanks, mom. Can can satisfy themselves that it's nice and burnt before they get into it. Well, I'll be damned. So this is our farewell lunch with Judge court as we think. Sure. Thanks. I mean, he may or may not have a place to sit when he moves over to qm.com. He might just have to move on to the other side of the little card table that we have over here on the side. So we have a place to squeeze in. And if Chris isn't one of those five minutes of one taller free food, you can come in and have to free food every day instead of him. I probably still will be. Yeah, we got to support. We got to train really well. I want to store. I guess mad dog is a cafe of why, huh? Yeah. Hmm. See, now this feels more like at home, you know? Okay, I can do it for you to hear me eat on the ear. Right? Yeah, I haven't been doing that. 189 by the way, in the scare this morning. Not too bad. That's good. Oh, it's not great, but I mean, I just can't break through that level. I don't know what it is. Hmm. Maybe it is a few times far away. Yeah. Yeah. That wasn't me. What was that? Hmm. So what? I was a judge. Where can fuel salt's going to call any second now? Okay. Seems got her. Can't get rid of me. It's a crazy person. Yes, he is. So you tell the truth, people are going to think you're crazy, Neil. Look at you. Look at me. Not too happy with what I see. The reason main reason I wasn't the 1131 votes. We got to 1000, look the easy man. You are such a negative, too, a little, you know. Why does goes, just guys, Joe Bell called you on Friday and live to you. No, actually, he repeated everything that he said to you behind my back. Yeah, they did things that are coming here. Uh-huh. And the tapes are better. There are going to be any tapes because there isn't going to be any extension. There isn't going to be any Neil working for days a week and forget about it. He can rot. Hmm. The main reason I wasn't the Neil for last 384. Or should get in the future today. I'll tell you that. He's a freaking genius, 340 underlined the freaking part. Those bedtime stories, 45. Tyrion's suffer 41. Worse you're here in plenty of that today. The crazy collar is 35. I'm bored 35. I hate this pull 15. It's a great for most sports 15. I hate Neil 14. My poison. Ah, that's a bad bad bad. And he tells the truth. He speaks the truth. Seven. Solomon, they see it thing. Only seven. But then let's go to go zooming up the list. I think it will. Let me ask you to this. Okay. Do you think that if one of these two individuals, if they like put me down as a friend again, open up their profile so I could like confabulate with them? You think I would do that? Yes. Sorry I should have taken more time to think about that. Think about during the break. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. I see you thinking. Yes. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Goodbye. Sit down. Okay. So what you're done? That ought to show you why. It's like he's born out. I'm not a leather man. Even if it wasn't you. Who would have taken something? But open up you just with the facts. We like to be retarded. Just like our mighty leader who's a drunkard mental case. If you'd have never been there in the first place. And the soldiers who are offered for a more than welcome to attack us of King. We need more than sins. Poor fortune is already a little friend. And don't be this close to you now that you're in.

And Bob Turner on WHEC. Let's go back to Rochester. What do you say? Not. I have to laugh at all these people who reminisce. You know, I mean, you know, it's this fun reminiscing a little bit. The way they take the past and twist it in the miniature as if, you know, like Rochester was some great city like with somewhat of a bit of a, I mean, if it was what it was and what it is now you don't want to know from. Well, I'll tell you one thing man. The fog. Maybe it's just my window. Maybe if I would like go out on the balcony and shmere off my window. Okay. And it would look so foggy and depressing. I think because it looks to me like there's a little bit of blue sky and little sunshine. They don't have a lot of snow more than no more. That's free time warm. The off north now. They don't have the window washers that you're building. Yeah, they do, but they have this habit of falling off. 40 degrees right now. That's not so bad for the January. It's going to be 41 42 something like that. And they're saying maybe a little snow for me to say, no, no snow. No more snow. All your kids out there waiting to see snow forget about it too late. Not going to snow. No, no, no. WQAM. Hello, except in Denver. QAM. Oh man. WQAM. Hello. And finally line 9 QAM. Okay. There they are. There they are. Pass it around back and forth side by each.

Based based on the fact that they just, they, they, they, they don't think they can't have to send it very best. They won't say anything. They won't do anything. These people. These are just, uh, inseparable bass thought of grosses. What they are ridiculous. 5, 6, 7. Here's my last call. See if we're going to get any real colors today. We're trying to out and you do understand why. There's a lot of people. You know, with the holidays and everything. This is the beginning of the, see, you thought it was last Tuesday. So did I, but it wasn't surprise. Yeah. No, seriously. This is the beginning of going back to real reality. And the kids are even back in school yet. Right. They, yes, Broward. They, yes. And of course, in. No way. Well, Broward, but they're going to learn their anyway. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Especially now that they got no more. Pumpernix. What are you going to learn in Broward for crying out loud? Uh, if you old people steal the silverware and he has Sweden low and the roles and the deal pickles. You know, those old bags that's, that stuff that deal pickles in their purse with all they hear and then throw jam in. Oh, man. I'm going to be a real appetizing when you get home. Trying to gum on the pickles from Pumpernix. Didn't even use it like a little zip lock bag in there. Wouldn't surprise me. Here's a message from Phil. He says Joe Bella is an A whole. If he thinks tapes are better than George. Have they done enough damage to the program in the past few years with all the time, slot changes. Firing Joe Rose. Putting Galdi on here. Seems like the program managers are work at trying to screw things up. Still. Absolutely. You got it. Yeah. It takes my, I still don't ever be any more of the stupid best of tapes. This is Joe Bell's nimble mine at work again. Wow, you know, the audience wants to hear Neil when they turn out to fret like an December time when I'm not there three days a week and when we still are number one by a mile and beat the whole out of the other segments on the station by a mile. Got them pulled. Now this is a guy who just doesn't like you on here. That's all. Go to the railroad. Well, I'm sure Greg probably, you know, giving me talking to it. So, oh, George, you don't want him on there. You don't kill the ratings and you can't sell the show when George is on. Bye. I like that. I can't say it's a mood point. There are no negotiations going on. They were not going to be any. And, you know, for once in my life, I'm going to butcher up. See, the problem with me is that I will admit it. I'm weak. Just like this thing with all this online craft, man. I'm weak. In the case of the online stuff, as you know, and I make no apologies for it, I'm a sucker for a toothpaste. That's all I mean, that's me, you know. You're a daily one. Of course not. If it was just me, I'd say, wow, live. What's wrong with me? Well, everybody is. There are most people are anyway. Some people are a little bit wiser than that. They've had some bad. They've been burned to many times. That's right. Scard. They've put their hand on the stove too many times. They don't want to get burned again. And in the case of this place, I keep saying, well, I got two years to go. And then keep extending and misunderstanding. I'm not going to work until I croak. I don't give a crap. Who's in my will? I'm going to have me a good time, whatever, a couple of weeks or years or 20 years. I got, who the hell is what it is, minutes? Well, we'd like to have you to work until you're croak. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure that that the croaking day comes soon rather than later. You're working real hard on it, smoking. You're what I tell you that right now. And then lunch still suck. Super good though, but the rest of the terrible week. And the company. Ooh. WKWAM. Hello.

What does this have to do with Nick Saban? That's the obvious question that's on the mind of South Florida and everywhere. What's he's got to do with Nick Saban? He turned on us. He abandoned us. Screw you. WKWAM. Hello. Hey, nearly. It's not going to be that gambling. Joystick. Call me. I saw this. WKWAM. Hello. KWAM. Hello. Now, those show me standing.

Before I go insane, I hold my pillow with you in my head and spring up in my bed. Spring me out the words I've read. I've been caught up here. I know. I've been well-loved. This morning, I woke up with this feeling. I didn't know how to deal with. And so I just decided to myself. I'd hired it to myself. And never talk about it. And did not go in shouting when you walked into the night. I think I love you. For my soul, I'm afraid of the prison. I'm not sure. I'm a fair and so pure soul. I've got to be here. I think I love you. If it's not what's left in fail, you like it or it's what it means to say. You're not never filled this way. I don't know where I'm up again. I don't know where it's all done.

If it's not what's left in fail, you like it or it's what it means to say. I never filled this way. It means me. You really don't have to worry. I don't know where I'm up again. And it's just taking away how will. But I think there's still a better way around. I think I love you. I think I love you. Well, I sure love him. I'll tell you that. Very proudly. But that's a long time ago. That's another era and another age. Anyway, hey, David, you're fair. Come on. It's chapter one. At 5.60. I'm a little format change here today.
