Listen up, that's today! You may have been a big shot! But today, you're my big! And I looked up the road! Okay, I looked down the road! See any cars comin'! No! You're a big sportsman, right? Oh, you know, right? Good! Yeah! Have a think of the car! Okay! Hurry! Faster! Faster! Come on! Faster! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Ten nineteen and five sixty-wf. So this is shocking! Did you read this at the bottom of my road? Yes, that's not really... Every word of that, yes. Somebody facts us in the Daily Pulse. Say it ain't so Joe, is the headline? On the year Wednesday morning, meaning last Wednesday, NBC Six Sports Anchor and Dolphins Color Comitator Joe Rose commented on Car and what he said wasn't pretty, right Bob Norman? When a color mentioned something about the difference between light-skinned and dark-risk skin black women on Rose's morning drive radio show on 790 the ticket, Rose entoned, that's interesting for us, or isn't it? Rose entoned that he preferred lighter-skinned black women whom he termed red bones than darker-skinned black women or chocolates. And then he added that it's his understanding that most black men feel the same way. Now this is breaking his our right-this Bob Norman says the cruel geophones attorney Jack Thompson who gave national fame fighting up sending the in Howard Scurren his contact to the end of the OECP about the comments and Howard Times reported Elgin Jones is digging in the matter. He went and said, don't know how red bones are more difficult than dark-neighbones said about the in the woods. You know, those words could be said that they're stupid and hurtful and double like this. This is unacceptable. Absolutely. I have to give you confidence on the way in high-saving a little about. And then he would do something about on the radio. So, the government says that we're not going to meet with Thompson. Every question Martin, you're this against this where I do. This is something I can't paint. We're more so far based on the memory of those who heard the note taken. The surface of the red bones is requested to grab a completely radio station. It's one of the kind of organization managers. It's been a certain time to try and make sure that the water in this radio on the sure right spot for me to be Howard new times magazine. I've never heard that term before my life. Well, red bones are so off-cylinder. I've never heard that term before. I've never heard that term before. I don't want to like that. I don't want to like that. Have you tried to keep our notes clean or unless they're too soon? Right, though. Let's just dance on the grave from the sidelines. Better better than I never heard that term. I've never heard that term before. Of course, personal friends have decided to start with me and with us over here. And maybe a little bit more time over there. Good. Are you going to get started now? I don't want to like that. Never less. Let's see. What we are waiting for. We're waiting for you.

Here is a fact that says, from somebody who's going to be really crying, somebody in Monroe County, no one, somebody in the keys, says, Neah heard the roasting last week. He was just saying he preferred red bones over darker women. I prefer blondes with big boobs, so what? Also, he said he finds most black athletes, not black men, preferred red bones over darker chicks. Oh, that makes it all better. All he was doing, all he was saying, you, you mean a piece in the tents? All he was doing was saying his own preference, Fragon Riders got nothing better to do than make something of nothing. See, this is why I disagree with whoever wrote this, who doesn't understand. It wasn't Bob Norman, who created the big Timis about it. It was the local self-appointed, the hot shot and curl cables, who's all over. He's the local self-appointed, censor, and software to radio. Whether it's this show, the Howard Stern show, the Joe Roach show, the Hank Goldberg show, you pick it you name it. He's going to listen to him, what's not the nice? Obviously, I've got way too much time on his hands. So he wanted to play Bob Norman's or what he hit. It was the local self-appointed, the hot shot and curl cables, who's all... Howard Stern show, the Joe Roach show, the Hank Goldberg show, you pick it you name it. He's going to decide what you're going to listen to, what's not the nice? Obviously, I've got way too much time on his hands. So he wanted to play Bob Norman, or what he hit, but I've placed a blame, or I know exactly where it lies, and it's not the new, it's the same. I mean, I've 20 years of this I've hit, 20 years. And we just keep going on. Jonathan and plantation, 237 Drapas, and he must've thought I was kidding about that. I'm not that's on our feed, we're trying to, anybody's trying to listen online out there. We apologize, but how would you want to start a week out without a Monday morning like this, a QAM, right? You see, I'm convinced now, be on the shadow of a doubt, that they just don't care. You know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that Jalea Joe Bell is standing there to win the wave in the white hankier, whatever. Maybe it was left over from our quiver. He's waving a white flag at the window. We just surrender, we give up. I'm not talking about to the guys across the street. I'm just talking about in general, we give up. We give up, we give, like, you know, little kids playing, you know. And post the late the same time on the screen there. Oh, well, I'm just hoping you miss it the first time. It gets here the second time. I go online right now, man. And I keep the radio up loud, too, that way here are three times for the first of none. What? It's three times as good when you hear me three times. It's three times as good. It's three times as good. I can do it too. If, in fact, what I'm going to do is going to repeat everything three times. It'll kill two hours in the 16 minutes, not that I'm counting until I pregame show. It says, Neil, I put the ad in the trades for you. Feel free to have the engineering person ever move from the building. So, Jonathan and plantation. Wow. We don't have, see, we have engineers taken out of the building if we have an agent. But we don't. We got, we got some people passing themselves off. So, who told you that? That's the, the pre delay and the post delay. And we actually heard on, uh, courtesit is laptop. So, staff and everybody else was checking around. It should be fine now. Oh, it should be fine. Oh, yes. Oh, we're fine. We're fine. Alright. Spile on his hand. It sounds like, you're not going to believe this. I mean, George knows because he just thinks this to me. I cannot believe it. I got the thing on my, I got a email. I think it was yesterday. From my bright and high school alumni thing, which I didn't go to bright and high school by went to bright and elementary. So, somehow I got long time ago. We got on their website, you know. Because a lot of the kids that went to elementary school went to bright and high before I moved away to beautiful Canon dig when the earth. But anyway, so Barbara Sloan had said, I said, I'd suddenly, you know, I'm wondering, can't be the same Barbara Sloan that we knew from Channel 6 for it. I hope not. I don't, I don't think so. I don't know. You know, I mean, I looked in the Herald and the Sun Sun. I'm hoping not. But anyway. Dahl fan Denny is dead. Oh, no, that's bad. Don't be doing that. It says, Dahl fan Denny may not have been as level as the first dolphins mascot. Flip or, oh, flip or I wonder if Luke Kampot was the first dolphins mascot. Oh, if they didn't told me that, I'd have been a big fan. But he made plenty of waves in the stands and on the sidelines as the earth dolphin fans into a frenzy for nearly 34 years. And inspired even even had his own drop in on the show, Dahl fan Denny, which I'm sure I can find eventually. Dahl fan Denny is dead. Dahl fan Denny, Dennis Sim died Friday from kidney disease and cancer he was 72. Flip ball was his life in his work too, said his wife of eight years, ingried Sim from their home in Sarasota. He loved the dolphins for the very end. In 66, the dolphins in our girl season, Sim attended games wearing rhinestone cover to tire and resort the fans to cheer. He was working for Bell South Sim said of her husband. He had had to make the decision to work or do something he loved in football. A decade later, team owner Jorabi began paying dolphin Denny and on the will feed to be the team's unofficial mascot. You know, like a few said a game. But third man. Sim retired in 2000 was honored by the dolphins for 34 years of service. He was given a double V Dodge Ram pickup truck. As retirement president. I didn't know Dahl fan Denny had double V's. Former dolphins president Tim Robby said Sim was part of the show. One, your crack and knuckles again. It's bad. Yes. I've just dropped the judges that dolphin Denny is. Bit the dust. One of the reasons he became a sideline. Naskot. So the speaker was he was getting in people's way in the stands dressing up and with those big banners. Robby said that the chuckle. His heart was in it. The obviously was a true die hard fan. Ingrid Sim said him a moral service is planned for the way he did. So anyway, Denny Sim, dolphin Denny is dead. 237 drop out. So it stopped there at 237. Let me refresh it again. Okay. Just to make sure that anybody who's trying to desperately listen online isn't going through all kinds of psychotica still 237. That's a good sign. Not a bad sign. Or as noodles would say. Good time for the great take. If he could. Neil, this is noodles. Reminding you that it's always a good time. For the great take. By the way, if you go to the country kitchen on Sterling Road in Hollywood, you won't see great video waiting tables anymore. Noodles is taken as place waiting the tables. Greg is washing the dishes back in the kitchen. A little bit of a come down, but never less. At least that way he doesn't, you know, then have to put on that kind of embarrassing when you've been a big radio star. And he never wasn't a big radio star. Just that all the people that used to write about radio. Remember those days when we had people in newspapers would write about radio? No. Well, yeah, it's long time ago. Maybe four year time. But they were a chance with Greg Beedell for whatever reason. Did he ever have any numbers? And he following all the audience? No, but he did for whatever reason. They loved Greg Beedell. And then I started picking on because I found out that he was extremely sensitive. And he was paranoid and thought that everybody hated him. And then we found out that they did. Oh, not, that can't be true, Greg. Now, what's the latest that we heard on Greg Beedell? Is he back on the year somewhere again? One of those like 41 stations or what? I don't know. See, I wish everybody in the business, you know, look. Almost everybody. In the business. 800. 30 votes on the poll over the last 10 years. What is QM's best morning show? 830 on the poll. We'll make a thousand easy. Because we got two hours of minutes to go. Who's counting? They all sucked. I'm pretty good. They all sucked. Howard Stern 144, even with all the cheesy poofs in it. The second first team. Delpho. Joe Rosenville, 113. Forwell. 110. Scott forwell. Ah, ah, ah, ah. The original first team on a one which we think is Dave Le Manson to be syphilis for nobody seems to know work here. Hank 68. I hate this poll. 50. That's 6% more on guilty. 28. Not a good number. At all. Don't do it. 28. And then Kenny and both finally edge the head by one. They got 14 votes and Vivo Gellie the broad the other guy. 13. In that desperate battle for last place. Get baby. Hey, ready to hear. That he dreams for Uncle Mikey's Double Talk school. That's right. A school of double talk with all Uncle Mike. You ever have those embarrassing social situations where you just don't know what to say. You know, words fill you. Well, Uncle Mike he can help by teaching you to say half as much in twice a time. With half the brain power. Who we do see our embarrassment by 50%. You're lonely being embarrassed half as much. Because instead of thinking about food something to say. You only got to think of one something. Maybe only half as something or something like that. You know, you need a girl and you say, you look lovely. Then instead of thinking about another clever line, you just say, fine, fine. How lovely you look. It's simple, it's painless. Best of all we have easy payment package plans. We get package plans at the School of Double Talk. Where is this place you ask? Well, I'm glad you asked. By the last one place. I lost my place, but I got to keep talking. Because we don't do retakes. We don't do no retakes at WIO and D. I remember, uh, old Mr. Eagle there used to blow his nose. I just made like a couple of his spots there. That kind of old ladies. Ah, here it is. Here it is. Part N01, North Bay, cause way of beautiful North Bay village. That's the old, mighty double-talk school. That's the school of Double Talk. 10, 3, 5, 6, 6, WQM. Good guy, man. He's, uh, he's, He's, he's, so the fish is not, but he was a good guy. I can't say that every time we talk about it. And because he was, he was, uh, badly misunderstood just like Alan Burke, you know. See a lot of people think because they listen to somebody on the radio that they, they know, or you know, more somebody on TV. They know something about them, which they don't, you know. The ringer is a good guy. I want to find out what their red ball means. WQM, hello. Good George, be in it. Okay, I charge, be in the same old time. See, one thing I'm, I think it over the weekend, cause I had way too much time in my hands this weekend. Way too much. And this thing with the phone calls. This is another jolly Joe Bell business where he's, you know, he kept telling me in the beginning. I just, you know, I just want to leave you alone. You know, you're great. I'm up above the bond. Just why do you up and let you go. And I mess with your show. But of course, every chance he gets, it's like, oh, you know, the way you treat the wood, the colors. That's, you know, the most important part of the show that, that we those calls, you know, the call suck, okay, Joe. What you know about this show, or about talk radio, I put in a symbol and have room for your fan asked 15 times left over in there, okay? What you know about radio and programming a talk radio, anyway, you can, you can put all those dropouts in there. And believe me, and our engineering department, that's about all we got is dropouts. Am I right? Look how great we were doing without the name called. So I was kicking ass man. I had all my bedtime stories here. We were sitting in confabulated bomb. I'm talking about his firing. Yeah, oh, yeah. That's right. I want to read the newspaper. I'll be getting a paper. WQA and hello. Hey, Neil, I just want to tell you the best way you'll die out there. Okay, great. And line nine, we know what it is every time, anyways. See, there's nothing on there anyhow. I mean, red bone, that's something I would think that these people might know something about all, but probably like me and you, and they never heard of it in their lives. Okay. I guess maybe we'd have to call Joe Rosenboss. Yeah, red bone, my ass. 850, 850, and vote for me. We're going to have close to nine hundred by the top of the tower. And we got two hours and three minutes to go until like Marlon's pregame show. That should be a real ratings builder man. Oh, yeah. We, that should put us right over the top, but maybe like about a one share. WQA and hello. Yes, sir. How you out about red bones? Yeah. Getting here is a good high set of band red bone on American band 10. And they were native Americans and did clock out and they said it means half free. Yeah. Yeah. I see. Some of us kind of like a Barack Obama have white and half of a black, right? I guess. You guess. Oh, he looks, I mean, you know, like that brother was under with the culper that was a culper. Yes. He wasn't really black and all right. That was on her 40. I was going to say he made a monkey out of her, but then again, so we don't say that. Make something. It would be out of work. You said, I heard you say it. I heard you say it. I know you went something racist by the, you know, this is, this is the deal, you know, when the, when the entire radio industry in the least in South Florida is controlled by one person who's got way too much time on his hands. And we just, I'll say they were on on pins and needles waiting to hear something you get agitated about. This is what you people have got. That's why, you know, we had the stern debacle on this station. That's why we had the feral debacle on this station. And that's why we basically can't say crap anymore. Because these people are like, you know, they're scared of their own shadow. Oh, gee, you knew I was playing fart noises again. Oh, what are we going to do now? Oh, yeah, the sky's falling. I still think the, the, the go back to the oldies, man. It's this way to do it. Safe. Sure. You can't even go into flying saucy the other day. That was, that was great radio man. It was by some red boat. You all hear that on that. We could play little red bone crawl, the red bone, the women lovers out there for Joe Rose. There we go. I worry, what exactly do we start from? That's not it. That's really interesting. When you see, like on some of those informers, you know, for time life hits of the 50s or 60s, whatever. And you see groups or recording artists that you never saw before. Sometimes you thought that they were black and it turns out they were white or vicey-versy. And then sometimes turns out they were red bone. Yeah. I could have sworn Mundo Jerry would fly. Oh, we'd push over, push over. But nevertheless, WQA and hello. QA and. I mean, oh, yeah. Okay, sir. I'm on Friday on the pole was never the lift. Oh, get out of here, Friday on a pole. Get lost. Nevertheless, my ass. Yeah, let's go back and we do Friday's full. I got one for Friday's full again. Yes, well, like I said about this today is a test case for me on these. You, you people are on probation today. This is definitely a test case with these calls. You know, I need these calls like I need hemorrhoids. I don't need, you know, I've been doing this long enough. 150 years. I can come in here blindfolded with my hand side behind my back and my legs tied together with the toes and then do four hours. When you've been doing it long enough, man, you know how to do it. And the idea that these idiots, these love reading moron and even him, I thought he, I'm sure he thought he had something to say. Don't you? Yeah, I always think somebody's going to have something to say about them. I'm talking about him when he made that call. Yeah, sure. I thought he had something to say that either I might be interested in or anybody in the human race or subhuman race. My favorite is didn't hearing nobody wants to hear what you just said. Sir, nobody, but nevertheless, don't ever call this show again. In fact, you may have been the last caller until this next one. QA and hello. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Do you think they got to scutters show about this? Yeah. Ah, ha. WQA and hello. Good afternoon. Good evening. Okay. Plan or see what you did. A chicken show was weak. I missed it. Ha ha ha. WQA and hello. WQA and hello. Mr. I just please. Yes, speaking sir. This is a meal. Who is it then? Who is it? No, I'm sorry. Let me say something you ran off the bat. Okay. When you call this number, there is nobody else going to answer it. Okay. So the idea that you're going to insult me by giving me a song. This isn't meal. Who the hell do you think it is? George Washington, George Washington, Carver. Oh, I'm here. What do you got for us? Say something for Chris. First of all, I was really surprised that someone knew noodles besides me. I'm ready for food. Okay. Good. Well, I'm happy for you. WQA and hello. This is meal. This is great. It is great. I'm going to do this all the time. I got my whole pile here. Oh, it's a long week. It's a Monday to Tuesday. I'm going to do this every day. This happened last week. We have a strong Monday as they say. It was really strong. And as Tuesday, you can buy a cake. That's another thing you've to see on it. Yeah. First team all the time. Oh, boy, that was really strong. The George by you. You know, really strong. Some jackass would call up and make some stupid ass comment about a dumb ass ball game. Oh, that was really strong. Wasn't deep. That was really strong. Here we go. And now we got him fired up today. Big time. This is your probationary period. Okay. You got like an hour and forty 58 minutes. But who's counting? WQ weigh in. Hello. Hey, I was wondering if you think that the bill was in guys as a chance in the election. But guess. WQ weigh in. Hello. And the only thing that says that's champion in the palm room. WQ weigh in. Hello. He's hearing. How about some strong. Now got. WQ weigh in. Yeah. I like red bone too. Now that you do. Ha ha ha. Keeping off any reservation, baby. Yeah. Yeah. Just speaking of people. That guy sounds like a real. Yeah. Yeah. Don't be picking on a red man. Now, okay. Hope you've had peace pipe out and come after you with it. You got to pipe. You got to have them booze in arrows. Or maybe you'll just say you're someone in can't do sticks. Some of them. Think he said that. Probably with the worms in him. WQ weigh in. Hello. Hey, Neil. I think the one number three. No. Okay.

Man, I want to go through at least 40. 50,000 these calls between now and the 12.50. Why not? Why not? What? Huh? Why not? We might have just 10 colors, but we'll have 40. 50,000 calls. That's okay. Keep them off the street. It's a pubic service for us. I know extra charge, man. Still only 237 dropouts on our streaming. So far, so I guess we must. We must have the biggest by now. We must have it like this. Over the last 10 years, what is Q A M's best morning show? They all suck to 197. Wow. That's almost a quarter of all of those. Howard Sprurma 154. The second first team, VFO, Joe Rosen, Galdi 120. For row 118. The original first team on 07, which we still, you know, whatever you say it is. Hank 71, I hate this pool 54, mirror 6.1 percent. Moan Galdi, boy, you talk about a drop off only 31. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. And then it's say really desperate life and death battle for last place. Kenny and Bow morning show 14. That's the hysterical Kenny and Bow morning show. Which I must miss the lot of those punch lines but man there's a lot of laughter on that show. Kenny and Bow 14 and holding up the rear, Defogulty, the broad and the other guy only 13. The Neil Roger show. If this is your going, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Any questions? And now here is Kenny Vee, founder of Kenny Veeing Pork Sausage, with a few words about new Kenny Veeing Vabel Sanctions. Hello, I'm Timidine. You know, if someone had told me 25 years ago that I'd be making bagels, I'd have said, huh? That's due food, isn't it? But times have changed and I guess I've got to change with them. But I don't have to like it. You people want your bagels, I'll give you your bagels. With a big old greasy slab of Timidine pork sausage, Johnny. New Timidine non-coachier bagels sandwiches. If you're Jewish, you can buy them. You just can't eat them. New Timidine bagels sandwiches. There's a little bit of big, every bite. It's 11 o'clock at 5, 60WQA. Here's a fact that says, how come I got a new schedule again, by the way, is there something revised that we didn't know about? There was a new schedule in the box. I don't ask questions. I would just forward them along. Looks like the same old crap I had before. Otherwise the rumor I'm starting now is the Marlon Games 11-15. Woo! Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Anyway, oh, University Dodge again. You think, you know, it's just amazing to me. I sure hope there's some cars down the road there. Or up the road where Ben Hele did. Because they've sure spent a lot of time in fact in that scrap. It says somewhere along the line I believe, Steve Shapiro was part of the worst team. You know, Shappy? Hey, Shappy! Shappy, my ass. Steve Shapiro. Slappy? Slappy, Shappy. 898, we're going to go over 900 during this assignment on, oh, brother on our pool. And then we got 1000 in the bag and a sack and that big old sack, baby. Do you hear what he said? He said sack. I don't know what he meant by that. Yeah. As in sack of crap. Red ball. I mean, everything is a big deal. Okay. What did he mean by that? And everybody's got to be all on it, you know? Because one guy's got too much time on his hands. That's what it's all about. I think that's what I'm going to do the rest of my life. I'm going to declare myself the self-appointed sensor. And if I don't like something or I find some reason to get all Ben out of shape with it, I'm going to make a big stink about it. How do you like that? Yeah, stink. I'm an ethicist that just decided. Our free speech case is divided present in bush from key supporters of his base. As many religious rights groups have joined the ACA, you know, there's a defending the rights of high school students at Article, and yesterday's New York Times says, in fact they just haven't here on CNN only moments ago. The case which will be argued in front of the Supreme Court today is open at unexpected fishery. You know, fisher is like something you have in your act, though. Yeah. An opening. The issue of the international administration and its usual allies on conservative Christian supporters, Linda Greenhouse says, you're going to be interested in this story. You know, the one this is all about. The one hits for Jesus. Oh, yeah. On the surface, Joseph Frederick's dispute with his principal Deborah Morris at the Juno Douglas High School in Alaska five years ago, appeared to have a little of anything to do with religion Greenhouse rights. As the Olympic tour to his carried through the streets of Juno, on its way to the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, and his TV cameras focused on the scene, Frederick and some friends unforall the 14 foot long banner with the inscription, Bong hits for Jesus. Oh, right. Smoke a May Fat One for the Lord, man. Pass it around. The principal tour down the sign after Frederick initially refused her to man to remove the banner and suspended him for 10 days. The Bush administration ended the case on the side of the principal end of Juno's school board, Greenhouse knows of course on the side of the fanges and intolerance and all the other crap and stupidity. Buck Greenhouse continues while it's hardly surprising to find the ACLU and the National Coalition against censorship on Frederick's side. It is the array of briefs and organizations that litigate and speak on behalf of General A Conservative Christian groups that slipped in Morris versus Frederick out of the realm of the ordinary. The groups include the American Center for Long Justice founded by the Reverend Pat Robertson, the Christian Legal Society and the Alliance Defense Fund, the Walthy for Institute which is participated in many religion cases before the court, and Liberty Legal Institute, a nonprofit law firm dedicated to the preservation of First Amendment rights and religious freedom. The Institute based in Plano text to told the justices in its brief that it was greatly concerned that the religious freedom of students and public schools were redamaged if the court rules for the school board. Religious freedom of students and public schools, what is Bong hits for Jesus? I see this woman a fat one for the Lord, right. Is that religion? That was all about same craft, that's the common to call a crap hola. Douglas Raycock at the University of Michigan Law School and the Thirty Unconstitutional which is... And authority on John Paul's Commission. And authority on John Paul's Commission. And authority. But where did you say? I'll think we're religion. We've worked on the Liberty Legal Institute's brief said that religious slaves are in students often find the atmosphere in public school to be unwell-coming and feel themselves a dissident and excluded minority. Good, problem and drip. He said either the status of being a citizen, you know, this isn't some either side. Will you calm down, take a pill for Christ's sake? I read that story again. We'll have a fat one for Jesus. I'm not reading that story. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no, nothing to do, no, no, no, we, thank you, thank you, no, no, no, no.

It's one of those songs that I never really thought about. It wasn't a good song, wasn't a bad song. But I just assumed it was sung by people of darker, you know, darker, complexed, uh, like that surprise. Yeah. What about, uh, there's another song. It goes, I can dream about you. You ever hear that song? No. What's up with my white guy? But anyway, there's a... Oh, they're damn... Don't believe a white guy's don't dream, man. There are lots of other examples of that, but, um, I can't think of any... Well, obviously, that's true. 911, about 911 on the pool, on boy, it's come at the appropriate time. And speaking of 911, we need help. It's an emergency. The church of Scientology has brought celebrity guests, other entertainment to mark the opening today of two new outreach centers in the Tampa Bay area. After John B. Volta, two fairies, is making a appearance at the opening of the church at St. Petersburg Life Improvement Center, Life Improvement with L. Ron Hubbub, baby. I'm looking at... Are they a kid like to the moon and nights? You think they're like, we are moon and nights from the inner core of the moon. I'll ride. The plant city center held at St. Petersburg opening ceremony yesterday. Actress Erica Christianson who started the movie's flag plan and traffic was the guest speaker. We've never had openings back to back like this before. Church spokesman, a woman, Pat Arney said it's exciting. It's exciting, baby. And I guess if you're living in plant city, it would be pretty exciting. The service feature libraries classrooms interactive displays, the locker information, introductory courses on Scientology and probably have the biggest closet in the entire universe. Joggetta closet, I wonder if they have wire hangers in there. Don't do it. WDQAM Hello. QAM Hello. WDQAM Hello. I love turtles, it might be better. WDQAM Hello. I love you, you love me. Five or seven, oh five, what? That was Martin, the dinosaur. Yeah. Like I said, I hope they all get another system to make. Because this is like, like, you know, the big when you flush the toilet, like, you know what it's like. I might even say that. I don't know. Kill turt. Like the world flush. Don't have to kill time. I'm trying to be descriptive. I'm trying to be a little loud. Go through that. Good job. When you flush that toilet light and when you got a really powerful suction there, you know. And just like then all of a sudden, or like, off into the, uh, emails of outer space somewhere. That's what we're doing. The classes are playing with it. It's what we're doing. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this little box, you know, and the, um, and all the equipment that has to do with the fun, I'm going to like, FedEx it to Joe Bell. So he can talk to these people every day. And keep them off this tree, give them some to do. Since he's such a big fan of the phone calls, Joe Bell. 924 votes on a poll. Go for get an hour, 40 minutes, but who's counting until Marlon baseball time. And don't want me for getting up to play, uh, red bell is. Yeah. Boy, lately I've had a rash of those things right. Go in and I think it's almost 30 in the hour time. And I go in and do a number one in there. And I'm just, uh, because I'm positive beyond any shadow of an out that the bit is kosher and a, okay, enjoy, subrooted, seven. And all of a sudden, you're, oh no. And I'm counting on you guys, of course, and little to why I know that you're not young. We're doing the same thing. Yeah, right, counting on me. I'm breaking up with me in a birthday card. Well, I don't make break enough cards. I feel all. Be a child, don't be thick. You just having a band, eh. I've had a bad day. Some sweat on this pew, eh. Because you have a bad day. You take the water down. You take the sand, some snow, some snow, some snow, some snow. And you take the sand, some snow, some snow, some snow. And you take the sand, some snow, some snow, some snow. And you take the sand, some snow, some snow. And you take the sand, some snow, some snow. And you take the sand, some snow. Guess there's been fire. You fire. You need to pack our guns and go. Now that's when I call, I'm bad, hey, hey, hey. All right, look, I've got a hangover. We know some documents. He lost his generals. He's in a fire. He's just in a nasty state. Like we lost our motor. I think I'm going to be six. You're fired. I've got one gold man. Yeah. You have a birthday. You can't wait. You can't wait. You can't wait. You can't wait. You can't wait. You can't wait. You can't wait. You can't wait. All right. You can't wait. You can't wait. I'm too low-floor. I saw this truck guy throw up. And then I'm fidgeting ate it. You broke hot. He cheated on me. I got your son. She dumped me and broke my hot. You broke your penis. I paid by I was just not to wait by tune. I'm in the middle of the day. I've been six years old. How about wedding your week sounds good to me? I keep thinking every time I play that, but I think the same damn thing about Tom Phenuchi man just wanted to wait his beak. Remember that just wanted to, yeah. That's right. And then he messed with that light bulb. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. See if these people had anything. I mean, I granted it to Monday, but nevertheless, if they had anything, they would be smoking because this is their last chance. Remember that day when I said this is the last call I've ever taken on the show. That was the smartest thing I ever did in my life. And then the stupidest thing I ever did was go back and start taking them. Again, it's done. It's done. It's finished. It's over. Pheneto, maybe. That is as stale as last year's Wonder Bread. Okay? It's as dull as a 48-year-old Gillette Moonblade. On the condiment show. Right. That's that's Jolly Joe Bell who's going to keep his those out of it. And if he wants to do everybody a favor, fix the parts that are broken. Maybe this part ain't broken yet all of you are working on it pretty good at looks like. And at last trend, a death now, a death now for all of us. It's just, you know, in Bruce Beesley, you know what he says? That's what he says. WQA and hello. You feel like you bought from the factory. WQA and hello. How do you QA and hello? Not even doing. See you week. You week. Now, if we had a real call and this, what has been? I was in a quarter. I mean, I'm taking calls on a quarter. I mean, you got to call the explained red bone to us. Oh yeah, that got to be real. It's largely worse than any. Then he said, well, I can't think of, there's so many good examples about what any of more, you know, like that. There's a lot of great stuff to say when you call video talk show. I just don't have any of it to say. And then it would be like saying that, you know. Wouldn't it be something if we actually heard something like that today? If somebody called and actually had something to say, I'm not holding my breath. And you never know. I doubt it. WQA and hello. Come test. The questions are the best. I love WQA and hello. QA and hello. Can you believe it's too good? So are you doing on your part? WQA and hello. Is there a man or someone going to my dumpbox? WQA and hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. Quick question. You remember how little beach full of art, right? What was that the question? No, that's not the question. They reduced the speed limit to 20 miles on the hour now. Yeah. Bad news out there. Okay, thanks for the good news. I like the other calls better to be honest with you. Oh, good. Golly Miss Molly. If you know something, I'm kissing everything I can get my lips on here. I'm kissing the mirror. I'm kissing the count. I'm kissing the carpeting here. It's a good thing I don't want to enjoy it. But I'm not there. What a place. What a outdoor insane asylum, a septic tank. A sewer. 943 votes on the poll though. I think we'll be right on the verge of a thousand by noon. God, are you kidding me? We only got an hour and a half to go. Well, thank the Lord for that. Oh, God. WQA, hello. Neil's good. Okay, great. I'm glad I don't have to get mad about making any more. Cause the news doesn't exactly what I should. It should not be upset about. I'm really happy about that. Just that's all I got, Neil. Okay, yeah, not much. QAM hello. Oh, the man, the truth. Oh, honey. WQA, hello. And you know what to do on? Are you on, sir? Listen, I want to do with people calling up and saying, I'm not a material, so they say something stupid. Because they never had anybody to be any to begin with. I see. Well, we're weird. What is? In conclusion, I'm not a material, I know. WQA, hello. Never saw that coming. More Neil, I will. Okay, sir. Good. Good. Good. Not regarding the fall, but once in that she might have missed out last week on the expressions was, uh, it left. Yeah, right. Let me QAM hello. QAM hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing today? Sensational man. Never matter. That's good. That's good. I can't, you know, I can't believe all these ones calling in. And no, and. There's a little thing like today is, uh, fourth anniversary of our lovely war here, and we're still not sure what the score is. Yeah, and what would you like these people to say about it? A good question. Yeah. WQA and hello. Hey, good morning, Neil. How are you? Yes, sir. Okay. I have a little thing to introduce, um, not introduce to entertain your audience. I'm, I'm not the other day at a bank, and a guy turns through his friend and says, So, who are you going to vote for in the election? And I swear the guy turned to him and said, I'm going to vote for whatever president grants the claimancy for the murder of any idiot who helps me two years away who I'm voting for. I love them. WQA and hello. Somebody can't do QAM. Do QAM. Anything on how you doing? Uh, okay. But even when you go see 300, yes. Yes, George Cena. How was it? Good. He said it was good. I want to wish you and George happy pathos happy Easter. Have a good one. Okay. Okay. If you go as to an happy Simka store, matter of fact, I have in my pile over here. I've got all the, uh, those other Jewish holidays. I'm going to start taking off. I think today is one of them. See you. Two-be-shfat. Hit-pourum. Paisach. Yom Hashoa. Uh, live the armor. That's one of my favorite. That's in honor of the Lord Boomer. Yeah, that's out of the boomer. Remember Paul Boomer? 1506 votes are in the poll. Let's play the farting contest. That should get Joe Bell out of a hiding from under his desk. Hey, Joe, you quiz-ling, you idiot. You're fair. You're doing a heck of a job, Joe. Now, I'm going to tell you, any guy that can come in and just over a year. Take this formally prominent pre-eminent AM radio station and turn it into like one and two shares, man. You've got, you've got to hand it to him. Phenomenal job. It's good thing they don't care about that. And you'll be very pleased to know that Kenny and Boer just edging out the default guilty to broaden the other guy in the last place. Just barely. By the skin of their teeth, skin of their ass. QA and hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay. A couple of things. The court, it was a, I get the London Times and it was Norical about a guy in Canada that had a discounted with almost $70 million from either a corporation or a government. You didn't know about that? So what about it? I don't know. You usually bring up stuff in the United States. You didn't make any issue about that. What does that mean? When in other words, there's no corruption candidates. That might message here? No, there's crooks everywhere. So what does the point? Point is I made an interview, Mark. Also, I want out of two, I mean, one out of two hundred homes United States are defaulting on. Oh, God, are you boring? Oh. Maybe the facts are good. It's a George. This is just for you. No need to send to the old man. Oh, God, you were blessed. Huh? I said, well, guess what? I thought you could, uh, He'll soon come with us. Sure. Well, whatever. It's still some interesting. Okay. I mean, it says a red bone. No, it's here isn't like this last guy. Oh, and there are actually a $70 million from a Somersome of St. Ian. And so who cares? Why is anybody who's listening to me right now to the center of my voice? Give a flying crap about what that guy just said? Even he doesn't care about it. How come you're not talking about the Crooks in Canada? And everybody's on the up and up about there. Ha ha ha ha. Much of Crooks in Canada. You stay there, pal. I'll stay here. And that's a deal. A red bone is a term for less skinned black person. Usually darker than a person you would call, high yellow, which is often an insult. And then we've been heard of any of these things. High yellow, my ass. Uh, that the term is that like old yellower. The term is not used as much because there are so many Latin and vibrational people that color that those terms are more frequently used. Like somebody might say, she's Hispanic looking or vibrational, rather than she's red. Much more common refer them as red than red bone. I never heard of anybody being referred to as red. I mean, me, this or red bone. Or anything. Examples beyond say, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Williams, Coastal yellow, it says, or some all identical beals, would be high yellow or be said to be able to pass as in pass for white. That this is all just, uh, you're, you, whoever wrote this was right. I mean, you talk about making a big sentence. It says, the hardest sense that Rose stepped on and I try to call that basis, the factor is that there is an old racial subdivide in the black American community. It's considered a huge issue in the African American, even Caribbean American community. This is just the kind of thing someone can pan into and explore, explode more importantly in sub-billion in the black community. Jo's real problem is the cavaler approachy term to the topic. It says, I can only assume he had no idea to the way to his words, but to say most brothers don't like chocolate. He'd be better off saying black sir better athletes and worse academic academic missions than, this is a whatever else. And this goes, uh, now the whole thing is just stupid is what it is. Okay, if you ask me just stupid, it's a big waste of time. It's like arguing about which drop a lot of our other faucet is going to chase the best. Okay, I mean, it's just stupid is what it is. Idiotic, moronic, you're fair right. But thanks for killing about two, three minutes. I was good. 971, I'm a fool. Now we're talking my language. Now we're talking something I can relate to. You know what I mean? 971 sounds like fun getting close to a thousand votes on the pool. On a Monday with a stupid ass Marlon exhibition game with the Astros from Jupiter. Coming up in 1250 to Saturday, no. No forget Hank, I'll be on after the game, man. It he can't seven to nine. Any interest? No. Really amazing. I mean, wouldn't you think that would what's going on there? There would be people. I would assume that there would be people after that last trend came. I thought it would be running up and down in the hallways screaming and shrieking like crazy people, you know? At least asking, do you like it? Like that? You know, something. No. But they aren't. Maybe they're just oblivious to think. Which reminds me of my favorite saying, and it's, I shouldn't have been on that list and it wasn't because it's a great saying, where there's no sense, there's no feeling. In other words, feel this. And I'm opening up the hot of terracillan in the country. You got to check out Brittany Shears' salon. Just think girl, no more extensions, color and or conditioning. No more teas in or burgine. I can't know more how to. We have several off the wall style for you to choose from. There's the cojack, the Jean-Luc Card, the death row in night. And my favorite, the Shenado Conor. They can't sing come dance to you. Can nothing compares to our low, low, low, Brittany Shears' prices? You have to be nuts, not to come on the end. Your new hair, for lack of it, is sure to be a hit. Even though I don't really know what one of those is anymore. But I do know, a style for Brittany Shears' perfect for the insane live of a crazy single mom. So come on down. Yeah, it's cut the crap while you're a busy cut and Brittany. Oh, Jesus. 1131 at 5.60WPM. We're now in 19 minutes away from Marlins' game time. What are we going to play to go up to the game? I'm mad. Very, very much. Is he right? Is he right? Or is he just... Oh, yeah. What would you rather be? Red bone or hand bone? On the hand bone all the way. Yeah. No more causes, we can no more mush. That's my motto today. Enough of the mush and stuff of the stupid ass calls. Oh, gosh. And that's private, the piece of information. Okay, stop for you. All right. Just because I say stuff, that doesn't necessarily mean it's for your ears. Okay, no, I understand. Eyes only. No, no. How loud. Somebody cue me and hello. See what I'm going to do is I'm going to disconnect. Like I kept seeing last week. Tell you what I'm going to do. And I would roll up his sleeves. I can't think of who that was. Maybe he was Jimmy Durania. Jimmy Durania used to say that. That's who it was. Tell you what I'm going to do. Jimmy Durania. What could he say? No. He was looking at. Yeah, he used to play the piano and sing. I thought he was going to do anything. And he came in. But he was a comic, but he was a piano guy, man. Victor Borger played the piano. So at least he used to threaten to. But he never played the piano. He was a great pianist, too, by the way. Can I say that? Joyce? No. He's a good player. He's a good player. He's a good player. He's a good player. He's a good player. I'm good player. Yeah. You can do it. Do it. Yeah, I don't think you're going to play the piano. I'm just going to play the piano. Yeah. I'm pretty good today for me. I like the way I sounded on there. I don't know about you, but I'm usually one of those people that doesn't like this sound of my own voice. He had been doing it. Everybody hates this sound. Everybody hates this sound of their own voice. I could be wrong about that. But I mean, what's all the line-o about radio anyway. I mean, what the line is about radio anyway? Right. And what is the pace pretty good for me? And I'm just going to continue. I'm going to continue hopping up those big chests and have it a wonderful time with it, you know? Mm-hmm. Ah, ah. WCWM, hello. I'm going to hit your business operations. Oh, she's my favorite week. So that's a third time in a week. WCWM, hello. And a great big one to use is the brush to babysitter's teeth with. WCWM, hello. Hi, good morning. Yes. I've been out of town for about two years. Now, got back finally able to listen to you again. Just a quick question. Are you still going to Vegas? Like, do you still want to? No, I never go to Vegas anymore. Why do I want to go to Vegas when I got my woodbind right here or Niagara Falls? But do I want to slip all the way out there in the middle of the desert for a zidian miles away? No, you still ramping right out of that. Great. Well, this is great. If you want to go all the way out there, it's just far. No matter where I'm listening to California somewhere, far. It's a slip. I was just curious. Anyway, we're good to hear you again. Okay. Thanks, pal. See, came back after two years. He wants to know why I still go on to Vegas. What he's trying to say is, I have no right. What do you care if I'm going to Vegas? What is that due for you? Okay. Who did Moe for your life? I mean, what is that guy to do with anything? Am I still going to Vegas? You know? I mean, it's one thing if I can come on your past along some useful information or some useful gas or something like that. What is this tell you though? Let me just, let me see if you right now. Very clearly. All of a sudden, there's something like I like, I had a religious experience. You know, I mean, by the time I'm reborn, baby, reborn. That's it. The whole concept that was going on here is insanity. These people are got nothing to say. They didn't have anything to say last week. Six weeks before she was 45 weeks before it tissue above. And what makes anybody think they're going to have anything to say? That's a phone call on a talk show. And this guy's one of the more lucid people we've had. And he actually thought that he had something to say. And he was away for two years. Now we can listen again. And I still go into Vegas. That's why I say to my still a pervert. Yes. So what about him? I still want to hold a flag. Yes. So, and how does that affect your life, sir? How can that possibly be useful to anybody? If I'm going to lose my ass. I'm off here in an hour and 15 minutes of that. I'm counting. I can call my can by right now during this next break. I'm going to be a good guy. I can't wait until I'm off. I can call my can by right now during this next break. I can have him pick me up at 10 to 1 or 5 to 1. And go out there and lose. Oh, I don't know. Have her much I wanted to. Would buy today depending on how much sure I'll strong my stomach is to put up with it? Do you know what I'm saying? What do you say? I'm saying I've had a real experience here today. Do you know what that means? Is it fly opening or I open? No, not a fly opener. That's hopefully that'll be later. I hope for that every day. But, you know, when you get to be when you get to be in my station in life and I'm not talking about this station. When you get to my station life, it's a little bit of a optimistic altitude. WDQAM Hello. I don't know what else goes to say. So, I got a good idea. How's it? See ya. Come on. See ya. You can do it. WQAM. Hello. QAM. Get my phone. Got to go. Yeah, I like that. I don't know what I'm supposed to say. I think he was the epitome as a moral would say. The epitome of what it's all about. I'm ecstatic. I'm the lyric. I don't know where the hell this all came from today. You know, I just out of the blue. I don't know where it's. But the good news is we had 995 votes. And the cool. It's only 1137. And Chris was worried about getting a thousand before ball game time, which is a minute and 13 minutes an hour into the third whatever it is away. You go and see knowledge. Yes. No, I know actually. I've got that this is a great day of clarity for me. My eyes have seen the coming of the glory of God. That's right. Whatever the hell that means. My eyes have seen the coming of us. Something more of the, you know, of the red bone man. That's stupid and surgical about the, you know, the self appointed sensor now is on Joe Rolls because Joe said this and this one said red bone. Who cares already? Okay. Get a life. It's partly monotonous syndrome of soft thord and neurotic repetition of same old, same old, same old people doing the same old tired crap. Making a same old noise. Like a bunch of overgrown children. Like that. That's the sound of soft thorda. Young people doing that. Which you expect that from like infants and old people. No, no, no, no. That's not for the for you. Oh, but there was this guy in Canada who in bezel 70 million dollar and like that guy's trying to give me a song to that. He's trying to give me a sell job and how Canada is so bad. Oh, it's terrible. I don't know how to put up with it, you know. WQAM. Hello. New God. Speaking. You've always had a pact and part of the front of listening to you with these, these colors look like watching the special baseball players. They're all that. They just feel. They just crush them and it goes right to the guy. It's not, it's a made. Not on how you do it. Keep it up. Ha ha ha ha. Oh, yeah. This is a real challenge. Crushing these calls, man. This is, you have to be a real talent to do this. Woo. Well, the way you handle those calls, Neil. That's what's really entertaining part of the, yes, I've been Joe, you wouldn't know they show. If George and Chris came in your studio next to you in your office next to me saying, and Bicholan, each cheek, okay, you still don't know what's going on. Big fan of the show, he loves what we're doing. He loves those big numbers that we used to have once upon a time through the fall book anyway. I think fall is the operative word on this stage, man. And it's like, you know, it's like everybody's jumping off the Titanic. The only problem is nobody's been a life raft. That's a problem. A thousand six votes on the fall. One O six, baby, we done it. I think we ought to have a repeat member last week when we did the 1500 votes on the show in one day. And spite of Chris's and Megatory attitude about the whole thing. I think we ought to like, uh, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But not get too carried away because after all. Thousands six votes in exactly no 1500. The biggest team, so the best. The best. The best. The best. The best. For those people who say, five doesn't matter. Well, it does.

No, or you think maybe change the people who are sitting at it Huh? Huh? Ten times One 023 over the last ten years What what's QAM? What does it say? What is QM's best morning show? I can't even read any more I'm so in coherent That's because I got a big challenge going on this week Man, I didn't realize I've got two challenges here The one with a phone and the one with a mush I didn't realize what tremendous challenges I was going to do with both B. Well you'll see I will prevail maybe like my buddy's identity Caliando, okay the main man prevails I will prevail you'll see You believe me? What? Ha ha ha ha ha Oh man On a Monday no less Challenges like that I'll see I'll do it my best I can Bally Thousands of 26 folks on the pool over the last ten years What is QM's best morning show they all sucked 232 what a grotesque in there There's the man Barack Obama does he have what it takes you to He's got his man Oh the he's on with Larry tonight Larry King with Barack Obama We know redbone by the way He is the inspirational leader that this country has been waiting for for 44 years since November 22nd 1963 when LBJ had Kennedy assassinated But anyway since 1968 when the Martin Luther King and the Bobby Kennedy got assassinated So that's one good thing about American the political scene man Every generation or two along come some really good dedicated person I want to do some good things and we kill him or somebody kills him And then they say oh it was a lone craze Disass in the right I like when the Lee Harvey Oswald said don't call me pass the F that was kind of cute Thousands and 26 votes on the pool they all sucked 232 those morning shows Howard Stern 182 are they serious? And the fact that they liked it in spite of all of those Whoops, bleeps and bleep I mean you talk about a company that ought to be behind bars for an idea You know and they didn't ask anybody if she liked that Anyway Stern 2182 for Rall 143 The second first team Defoe Joe Rosen guilty 137 the original first team 1116 Huh, Hank 82.

Yeah, this business with hockey You know, I like what what are you talking about we got the pantheres here right? And by the way, I'm not you know got to start paying money for next season tickets already and at least they're not going around trying to get playoff money from people this season And you want to know why because even though they've been winning some games here lately like a eight five over the islanders the other night They're not gonna make the playoffs again for the eight thousand few in a row And so for once I'll give the organization a little bit of credit for that after ripping them and ask for that grotesque trade Where they gave away a Roberto the long go for long gone Todd, we're Tuesday and for the human suit the interview for the rest of your hours all In fact, that's the only reason they've even even within the shouting distance of a playoff spot is because Alex all got injured and all Eddie is holding his backup The hockey top there for a gully animal I 233 votes on the pool a very pressure pack week little that I know when I got my ass out of the sack this morning I was gonna be in just so much pressure this week.

If you tune in late George and I both this morning, we just were a little behind the old eight boy, they say it is another stupid expression to late and yeah, and neither one of us had a look at the schedule closely enough. One thing I've learned today, never like gloss over the schedule, like grad here, grad it and like pour over and stick your nose right into it and the schedule too. And low and behold, Marlins in the Astros at 1250. And we both won. Oh, do you understand? We have to leave our friends early. Oh, no. And everybody's going to be tuning out early and we're going to serve with the fallout from that one. Then I'm going to just come out and then people are going to say, Oh, gee, you know, the mighty Neurology. Well, that's okay. The check still clear. 1087 on the pool. We know what no sweat. I'm 1100. See, I shouldn't say that because then they're like, what they'll do is then they'll start coming in by the ones. And see, there's another one. 1088. I don't like that. I like when they come in in big chunks with it. chunks so big you're on the smell them. Oh, that girl. Like you guys say, No, no, no, no, no. And then what he says, No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. Yes. Yes. Over the last 10 years, what is QM's best morning show? 1088, the 1080 votes. They all sucked. 243. That is a screaming indictment, screamers indictment. 243, 22.3% said they all sucked. How it's stirring to 060 with all the holes in that show. He was like downcrawling on them. They were shot in five times. Oh, we got that. Yes, you do. Yeah, but what is it under?

So 116 for Howard's firm for Rally's got 154 Scott for Rally. Yeah, let's bring those two back and see if we can't lose whatever little remnants we have. The second first team, Defogero wasn't guilty, 145. The original first team won 18, which Chris and sister was Dave Lamont and the farting man and Jimmy Sivillus. That's probably why they had to take Dave Lamont off the earth as he farts a lot. I know that because I did you end baseball with him that one season. You know, he was the color guy and the I don't think he was like the rib bone guy, the color guy. And he kept farting real bad. And an interfer with the back of our life, stating the best of role, my zollum sausages, you know, they're cooking on a grill outside there. You know what I'm saying, Chris, you ever been to New M baseball again? No, I haven't. Oh, well, like what am I asking you for? The original first team won 18 and where was on it? Hank 85. I hate this full 69 and 6.3 percent. That's not too bad. That's the nice comeback off your Friday performance when you folks are in the real sour mood. What do you like, better? Sour door, sour mood.

What's just the one I played at the beginning of the QM? What? What is that one called? Oh, morning sickness crew. Morning sickness. I do think that one might, yeah, and I'm out of the poor. I did look like Neil Bennett, no matter how dull you'd fool again. Anything for that, Carolyn? Welcome back to the morning sickness crew. We've done we talk about sports at a rapid pace. Do you fall down before snifter here? Sure. Hey, you think that's good when I was into track last night, a horse I bet on was so slow that Jockey kept it diaries.
