The manager of your world champion. St. Louis Cardinals and all other stuff. Does anybody we care about baseball anymore? My God. That is so pass. Oh. It's a good station. So pass. Let's just get in a lot of spots and make a lot of money. Deal. God. Several days ago I commented briefly on some recent statements that have been made by some members of Congress about Iraq. And it's important to make this point at the outset. The president of the United States purposely misled the American people on pre-war intelligence. American soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq go out every day of the some of the most dangerous and unpredictable conditions. These brave Americans were sitting in the battle for a deliberate falset. Pre-war information was distorted to corrupt the oil for food program. There is no denying that the president lied to the American people. This is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety. It's also something I enjoy. It's one of the reasons I've stayed in the business. And I believe the feeling is probably the same for most of us in public life. The president and his administration paid our country and paid the liberties for which we stand. Of the movie they go out on the shadows. Have no regard for the laws of warfare and feel unconstrained by any standard of morality. The president of the United States is dishonest and irreprehensible. None of us should want it in the other way. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's been 17 to 5. 16. I give the schedule no I did not. Marlon's in the Cardinals of 1250. Well that's a bad break for the audience that we have to get out of here early. Oh man. Don't ask me about LeBun because I won't tell you. Oh did you lose my ass? Bad. Bad. You're a bad street right? You're a man on a really nasty street. You know the money I've lost the last two three weeks of Woodbun. I mean want to think about it. But anyway. Marlon's in the Cardinals. Let's not talk about it. Then I'll call back there was playing the quarters and Vegas. See, well he doesn't understand and his foe, foe, my friend they call yesterday to try to get me all whipped up. You know what is a fake indignation. Nobody cares about some schmuck out there this plan. I mean you know if you're a Schlepper. Of course play the nickels. But the quarters have a good time. That's all. But nobody cares. It's not interesting. If I'm I would buy and I'd be care because I'm legendary. See there are no colors that are legendary. There's some that are trying to be but they'll never make it. So if I have a good date wood vine or I find a bunch of bad machines like History they want to hear that. I'm not going to go into great detail you know. It's like my late friend the great fat rich with his race track story. Oh I had the one over the four five seven and the seven broke in the four way into the great y'all. Nobody cares rich. I mean he's a great guy you know. Western piece. Big piece. But nobody cares about those things. Okay let's get back to Josh and me on the elevator there now. Well I think it's an interesting story. I mean it was kind of different. I mean I give you credit for that. I mean more see a lot of people as you know when I'd building. Especially the people of power 96 traditionally. Right from the very beginning. We've been in there almost 10 years now. Right. Niners plus very unfriendly. Yeah I'd say that. Yeah that's right. That's right. The people of power like they they're on FM and they're big they you know they have a living and breathing audience and they're talking to people under the age of 100 and we're just on AM. We're just a bunch of old crookers on AM even the long probably making more than the whole damn power 96 payroll. But what if it's a zap make you know. Now that's right. I believe that. I think that's probably true as far as the on the air talent. Well they do. One guy could give you a run for your man DJ Lazz but you think he's making the big bucks. I don't know if he's making as much as you I'd say. Okay Lazz is doing just fine. No give me a guess. What do you think he's making? If I were a guest listen let's play right out there on the table. Okay you and me today okay Josh my good buddy. Okay. First of all friend who loves me like crazy. I would guess I guess he's pulling down around a mil. Get out of here. DJ Lazz you can me. Why do you say like in those and he is he's doing. He's doing. He's doing. Yes he's liking. I don't know if he's going to be a good one. If you're a judge you should be making seven figures. So you can go to a with vinyl lose your ass. No but the point I was trying to make about the elevator is that there are a lot of very on friendly people including I remember one time this is a story that really is still to this day for us my ass talk about the epitome of soft food almost wrong with it. I mean we had been building all that long and I get on the elevator to go home at the end of my show. And you know it's a short what is it 15 20 seconds going on with that. Yeah, I'm going on this when the elevator is working. And there's two young guys on there. I mean both agree so I wasn't all interested. What? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not a paid attention okay. But they were all agree. But then then they were speaking English when I got on the elevator. Okay, they obviously got none to go down just before I did. They were speaking English just like you and I are right now. And all of a sudden the soon thing out on the elevator the door closed. It was like. It was like. I got a lot of fun. I thought. And not only didn't they even acknowledge the fact that I was on there or highly of how you got a heavy deal to wrap up yours and you faddle. Or faddle or whatever, but it was just rude cell. Screwed. Well, that one must be in date. I thought they were going to talk about you without you knowing what they were saying. Only one talk. I you think it upon him. I think it upon him. I got the 10-15 words down you know. Who are those trace like Scotty Mac? Who are those trace? We can kill the whole show on this because we've got a short show today. But I think it's uh.. It's interesting the fact that you would at least had the balls to introduce yourself. I'm a big fan man. I say I'm a big fan and I'm a bond man. I tell you I had like Tom myself off at the time I got to tell him the first floor Made it in the back like that Huh made it impact like that. No, I don't mean that kind of a no, no don't start getting like that Okay, don't start trying this into some kind of a sexual thing. I did a bunch do it Not a related or believe believe believe me at my advanced age You'd have to be somebody hell of a lot more interesting than you would have it impact like that believe me when I tell you No, I'm just saying it was just a nice kissy kissy job. That's all there you go. Yeah, that was nice And I thought to myself do you want a nice kid, you know, and then of course you want a fork and I'm gonna show and I realize well WQQ, they found hello WQA and hello See we're picking right up where we left off yesterday. We were Reverend Jones and his entourage of misfits and lunatics and idiots I'm not gonna waste too much time with that today again full me once she made us QAM WQAM hello Hey, I'm the host person for the toopless brigade. You think it's that one of the fish one of the problems with Miami-Dac County Yeah, go away Tony Larusia manager of the World Champion Sandley was Cardinals found himself sitting in the jail cell instead of a bug out this morning after a D-Y-West overnight in Jupiter Oh, no, I knew he was out of this world under cover city officers discovered Larusia sleeping the wheel of his blue for SUV around midnight last night near the intersection of military trail and Frederick Small Boulevard the Palm Beach post B-San The engine was running the transmission was in drive and his foot was on the break initially He didn't respond to several laps on the driver side window finally he was roused. Hey, Tony. Hey, you smoke he drunk Finally he was roused Larusia 62 almost his old design for Christ's sake. So in other words very old Was determined to have a blood alcohol content of 0.093% Jupiter police and a statement toward a single driving limit is 0.08 And he was 0.09 He was booked in the Palm Beach County jail for hours later the charges a mr. Meiner Members of the Cardinals were informed of the arrest as they arrived at the stadium Thursday for work face fresh shock and support for their manager He was one of the most acclaimed managers in baseball even before he managed the Cardinals to victory in the 2006 World Series I haven't heard anything said great in the loop or former member of the Marlins not pitching for the Cardinals I just know the kind of person he is not much respect I have for him. I'll respect him a ton. I'll stand by him Oh, if we only had stand by me by Benny King right now, which I know you do, but you know you can't get in the judges goods there, can you? No, not really. I mean I can't let him get into the judges goods 24 past 10 a QN here's the pull result from yesterday Short show today with the Marlins in the Cardinals at 12.50 a month or Tony a lead back in the bench show for today's game You think? Sure with a bottle by his side bottle a honey can 845 ohs out of this pool already a thousand even with a short show today a thousand as a given anyone Know why because this is the legendary You're right your show not just your ordinary pedestrian show Legend freaking dairy Here's the pool if I could be somebody else for one day. I would be we had 1357 most they didn't like this pool They didn't like it and you know something when you come right down to what they didn't like you because they don't get it These people ever call saying you have to are back in his prime. You know what kind of a deal is that? That's like saying a blanket when he was present. You know what what if I could be somebody else for one day I would be whoever to help we're talking about now not not 40 years ago Well, he who have there still wins 231 because with this crowd out there all they want to do is get laid You know and I say You blame me. Yeah, no, I agree with that all This business about you know if you're gonna go to school and learn something that'll be helpful to you in your career and make you a lot of money And all that that's great because then if you make some money, then you can get laid that much more But other than that there's there's not anything really all at relevant That's a terrible thing to say on the air. There's young and personal people off there. Yeah, good I hope they take the message from me. Okay, enjoy it and do it. That's my suggestion. Okay Do it a lot and do it even more you have your 331. That's what that's all about not because he's a great looking guy or because he made a lot of money But because he I may know what to deal with I got a baby 304. Yeah, sure tiger was 145 Not because he's a golfer and what that golf stuff would derail this week. Oh, oh my god Talk about pain, but because he's married to a hot blonde chick isn't that right?

What did I say earlier in a week? Question I said this is the week like a two point in my life When by the way speaking of that for my Close personal friend out there who may have read some of the ramblings I wrote this morning I know how to spell the P word. Okay. I just come probably get a little bit of motion For fear that I might actually think about one but at any rate You know the people where I'm talking about no, what do you say it ends in why but I put I don't know why did that I and G 884 votes on a poll which medical exam or procedure causes you the most anxiety he asked Procological exam finger up the back those but and this poll is only as it was sinned by the elistner whoever was What if that was Charlie B? Yeah, it was Charlie B. Thanks Charlie by the way you're the best he sends an 80s in polls every day Procological exam 302 Luke can now 132 who I never had one of those That's why I'm in such a good mood this week it's the first week in three weeks I haven't had to go to the dentist and get the Drill and popkey to round with all you a week straight no two two Mondays in a row But this is the first week I didn't have to go so I'm gonna even though I lost my ass I'm much rather be lose my ass at wood bind and go back to the dentist again I would a great hate this pull 99 111 percent now that that number is unacceptable because this poll is fine as G I wine is not damping wrong with it Devil exam 61 toothpick strangen 56 see how this is mostly dental crap But your whistles we got out there whistling Giving a blood sample Giving a blood sample 44 see that's one thing I hate about whether you're instant messaging somebody you can correct the spelling Right, yes In fact what you can do what I usually do is I like just retept the word in the next line and so they know if I misspelled it That I'm enough that's stupid, you know But in my space if you sense that the MSG in it You spell the like a native you can't correct it and it's not really worth the effort to send another MSG Oh gee, I misspelled that the word you know What do you do? They keep you like a proof of it like this is what you wrote kind of the oh I am not around have the time do you think I got the time in my electice You're an important legendary guy like me and we write what do you write articles? I mean if that's right none of your business what I'm right. Okay. I'm right a lot of perverted sex stuff is what I'm right And that's when I'm getting back good stuff I'm using stuff and in my case it is amusing dental cleaning 43 giving a stool say Sanctal 32 You know I could tell the story of my endoscopy and colonoscopy a few years ago I think we'd all like that when you really yeah almost as good as the story about my grassroots Michigan State but I told that one on here many many times you've heard that story haven't yes I have okay and I you got to admit that's pretty good story. It's very good At any rate it was what else was I got to do that was the only way I could protect myself was getting drunk I mean immediately live not sooner and poor Arlene the girl I took on that date, you know God heard drunk as on it the only the only thing I can remember about the actual being out there in the woods is her Remembering looking over every now and then she'd be finding a different spot like a dog you know on how dogs Nistima different spot to squat and pee in the woods because we were drinking so much Mysterbrow but at any rate Giving a stool sample 32. I'll say that story about they well, that's not really a story. It's just it. You know, it's the thing Because I was having I had the irritable ball and I had one to get my innards checked out so I had they I got checked out on both ends, you know They put a cue down your throat and a cue the other end Look in there and they look around and check everything out the shoes being naughty and nice and stuff Give me salt headed story. Still sample 32 routine medical check up 25 a God logical exam 23 treadmill test 22 I exam 13 getting a shot 11 getting a shot baby Especially if it's the tainted given the shot Giving a urine sample nine. Oh, why would anybody be upset about that? Well, maybe you'll let it drugs. No, no, but seriously. Oh, I see well look what was the question again? Which medical exam will proceed to cost the most anxiety? I see giving your exam because they're afraid You're gonna find out you're doing all them drugs Drugs baby Breast exam eight and an EKG seven out of 904 but we're gonna be on the way to a thousand by the top of the R You wonder why that's because Josh is here today. That's right. I think George is out in Josh's and we think Chris So I'll take it out Now let me ask you this yes since you and I are so chummy these days You know the funny part of it is that well of course I never was down there when you were working anyway Because when I would come down George would be running the board you'd be like somewhere else You know you'd come in and give me a kiss no, be about it right, but who do you think is making more money George or you and your new position? Now I either want to see what position it is. I don't think I'm very yet I I significantly increased and I'm doing okay Although I don't know what George makes I don't even have a much not enough not enough He's an unsung hero 70 and I sure hope he's not listening home of a sick and think that I'm you know Rippin while he's under the weather, you know Because you're with the audience with things. Oh, yeah, Neil wants to like Michael Jackson with a champion We must somebody younger and newer in there to take George's job.

But not just in the station right you know his appearances and and stuff that he does on the side I'm sure he says he's making about a hundred grand and he's making a grand for him I'd say he's making a lot more than that boy He must be I never heard of him to be honest with other than the fact that no he's in a building He's been around folks at the I-D who I am oh, of course What do you mean by that he works at power? They don't talk to us they treat us like like radio guy DJ like when he is Was the legendary in the Rogers then yes, he does he's probably over there though, isn't it? How old how old are the guys this DJ Lazz? Do you know that's probably about late 30s? 40 maybe I don't know WKWA and not there that's a damn shit. That was gonna be a good call Oh, and that man he piece yeah, he did that adventurer Well, that doesn't tell me anything adventuramo Anventure those kids could be from Miami day to FIU or UM or from hunger all of the above Yeah, I'm from all of those great institutions of our learning be they could be from dimension BCC even Rourke community college Don't be putting down kids it went to BCC okay, just because they've majored in win surfing and stuff like that There's nothing wrong with win surfing ever tried No, well if you're in Florida, you'd say you know one of those things that you do win in Florida You said it's prepared to get there allowed so how was that how was what when surfing went surfing? WQAM hello To want you to make more money. WQAM hello Hey, Neil. Yes, I don't listen to you since the WILC days My foster me on to you and I don't know why foster me on yeah DJ Lazz is pretty only five guys with Polio or something he's got polio Some exonters break or something. Oh, no. Oh my god. He's going to be with the limp He's the gym for the limp DJ Lazz now. He just got just made that up or is that the emissars? That's the truth. No, he is his his moniker is the pimple with the limp He really does have a little yes. I don't know if that that's the actual reason behind it Now is that because he's got polio myelitis now I don't know I don't know so often. Vendor the polio vaccine see the line or something That and you know something the fact that I know that you're in a song Inventive polio vaccine isn't going to give me a later anything like that See that if you know something and it's not going to be advantageous to your sex life It's really rather useless, you know or unless it's going to make you a lot more money like here at QAM We're one and 80 billions spots in a morning show and we can't figure out why they can't crack a one share, you know By the way DJ Lazz is 35 low tool for you All look at this somebody just passed this in we think him profusely and the traffic checkpoint tomorrow Do we want to I just like mentioned it now? Yeah, let me don't let me forget tomorrow because I know George is going to be out sick again tomorrow I think you know how I work two days in the summertime Yeah See because when you run the other side of the glass you were as useless as breast on a on a bull frog You know, but on this side you do a good job They need you got Chris he does a good job in here. Yep In fact when I got that message this morning that George was going to be out sick today I Like I was you can't get myself not that I want George to be sick or I want him to feel bad You know, but I just thought it gives us like a different different perspective for example Some somebody just raised a very interesting question about male prostitutes And you have a lot of thinking what's interesting in that although that it is because it goes back to that BS and Thank God George isn't there today. So I have to fight all day on this thing if if a young guy goes out like years ago I've got photo these stories. I mean what do I care at this point of my life? You know guys used to pick up hookers on the bullvard and the in Queens like me used to pick up young guys Who were hustlers on the bullvard many many a time is nothing wrong with that? We did that poll one day almost I wasn't about 50% Chris 50% of the paid for sex at least once in a lifetime Yeah, right there. So what's the big timis with that? So the fact that those guys are out there selling their body for sex does that make them gay? by by By the hour the minute Gay You're both full of crap make makes them you know, it's it's a living must though the must the living little 11 as Time and Rothwood say well, I'm not gonna open up that pain door as box again, you know, it's just what's the point BS so that the disease will conduct a traffic checkpoint on Friday March 23rd That sounds like tomorrow boys and girls from 730 to 1030 p.m. to Marnight in the 26th-hester block of north-west 49th Avon Lauderdale lakes if Tony Laurosa's less than the yellow water it likes tomorrow night. He'll be gone any wise and Jupiter vehicles have been expected for the effect of safety equipment motors to be asked to show their drivers license Registration proof of insurance and give out a good healthy breath like that They'll be asked to show it tomorrow night 730 to 1030 2600 block a north-west 49th-hav in Lauderdale lakes, which isn't really very nice That's way close. Yeah Well, they keep doing that to us nine hundred and 32 votes on the poll WQAM hello Neil yes Then Marland games got rained out you got to stay on until two o'clock.

This is a banner day trust me 1941 votes on the pool and here's the deal Which medical exam or procedure cause you the most anxiety Proctological exam we don't want to get too deeply in that back them 317 Group canal 142. I hate this pool 100 eight 11.4% is actually going up What is there not to like about this pool? I think it's most amusing if you ask me Not as amusing as the guy with a weather report but nonetheless Devil exam 63 two fixed tracks in 59 most of this is like truth stuff, you know We'd like to say who you most are afraid of Sandy claws the boogie man or the tooth fairy Oh, giving a blood sample 49 dental cleaning 47 giving a stool sample 32. I didn't tend to the story yet about my I don't want to go into it. Oh, yeah Yeah, you do now. I do not it's too. It's too gross about that whole procedure You got to go well, nobody wants to hear not go on into it too deeply. You'll just have to be already teased it right around the edges here I've teased this routine medical checkup 27 a kind logical exam 24. Have not one of those yet Fred Maltese 23 I've zam 13 what looks the problem with that? I guess because your eyes Will they dilate them? You know they dilate your pupils kind of like what the priest do to the altar boys They dilate the pupils getting a shot 12 giving a urine sample 10 Breast exam eight and EPG solument they see at this is the Neil Roger show There All that Shakty earth crack Make me sick Oh, everybody says that please drink.

Here's another end can be in truth. Oh, should be fitted for a larger suit. Oh, listening to him is a show that's much bigger than before. I do not like him. Oh, okay, level 0, 3 at 5, 60, W, I'm a look at if they float or wait. I'm not that I want to be influenced by some quiz link that calls up with that squeaky fake voice. He was excellent though. And I'm looking at the map and I see rain and south Florida, of course. In fact, I see some thunder star stowers over Dave County, but Jupiter is as clear as a bell. That's crystal clear in Jupiter. Perfect. So, exactly. Practice makes prefect baby. Have no fear the marlins are here. Whether without Tony Larusio or any spot on the booth with my master browse. Okay, well, I'm ready for the story. For a lot of story. Go ahead. About my colonoscopy. I'm going to ask you to do it. Do it a living in baby. That's great. And they stick a tube down your throat and a tube tube tube up your back. But they get a not you offer us to give it that really what they give you a shot. Oh, make you the needle man. And they don't put you completely under like if you're going to be operated like when I gobladder I had taken out. It's not that kind of a. I don't know what you would call it. It's like an intermediate kind of anesthetic where you're like you don't remember anything. And they give you a shot. Well, how also they're going to put you out with like laughing gas. But you ask you to put in a utility man. You have to give you a shot. They put that put you out. Like we're pulling the brain and you just never remember a thing. Perfect. Now they give you a needle shot of some stuff and they you know nothing. Which is probably not all they could especially when you know where they're going to be examining. Probably better to be a little bit aware and then you wake up and then the doctor is standing there. Which is this guy was a very good guy. That was his area of expertise. And he tells you that he looked up there and down there and inside everything is just oh, where are you? Why? He's it looked just like the old Hershey highway or something like that. Say something cute. Said everything was fine. But the night before you know you have to do a little prep like show prep for like doing a show every day. You have to do a little bit of prep like you're going to go in there and get the old canals man. That's right. The ear rekenal and the barge canal and the well on canal for audio Ontario people. Let's go to the well on canal. I don't know what we're going to do there. But let's go to well on canal. And so you have to provide. Well, they do these other tests to a I forget what they call it that they they test for a certain kind of bacteria in your intestinal frank. What? Well, the reason I got concerned about that is that my grandfather. I mean, they all didn't say them care about all this my grandfather on my mother side. Abraham Solomon that before I was born he died of stomach cancer. And so I'm assuming because what do I know about all those different genetic things you know. So I'm assuming that if I were to cope from something like that that could be it. You know, so so the irritable ball you get all you get these pains in the side you think all your genes. I'm going to croak you know. And so let's probably go and have a check down. So then I before you have to do the prep you have to like do a real good internal cleansing you know. What do they call that like a a blueberry explosive animal or something. Yeah. And then also to check for this bacteria which I can't think of what they call it. You have to provide stool samples just little swabs, swabs, swabs. And you have to. I'm not going to go into it. Okay, we can't do that. That's like too heavy duty, you know. It's just a two-growth test. So after smear and smear and then you have to put in these little bottles and close it all up and then you have to shake it up too. Shake it up baby. Yeah. Look what's inside there. Oh god. Look what's in there bottle. So that's what you have to do. There's my might someday you know all you people out there all you punk's man you think it's only us old farce. Well guess what someday if you're lucky you're going to want to be in old far. And then you're going to have to want to do an colonoscopy and the endoscopy and all these two. But every kind of place where you wouldn't even want to imagine you know. And you're like in co-haring. You have no idea what kind of probing is going on there. You have no clue who's doing it and what they're doing. And probably just as well. Speaking of a few, but he missed me creator of the Orwellian news. Yeah. And again, until we got him to put in his democratic operative, the word for a digital consulting firm would tie his to rival Senator Barack Obama. That's not good. Philip DeVelisay strategy with Blue State digital, actinals it in a view of the AP that he was the creator of the video, which portrayed Clinton as a big brother figure and heard support for Obama's presidential campaign. DeVelis 333 said he resigned from the firm yesterday after he learned that he was about to be unmasked by the hovingdonpost.com, a liberal losing opinion internet site. Blue State decided Obama's website and one of the firm's founding members Joe Rossberg's took a leave from the company to work as Obama's director of new media. The connection to the campaign is likely to be a setback, it says for Obama, who has cultivated images of politician who wants to rise above Buronekal politics. Buronekal. It's true. He asked me, he developed a set last night, he said he produced the ad outside of work, and then neither Blue State nor the Obama campaign was aware of his role in the ad rush, Mach, what an idiot. Sounds like sabotage you to me. But a raises to my brows so I thought at best, our resign, not put them in that position, he said, Thomas Gensomer, director of Blue State Digital said the virus was fired, did it. Mr. Develis created this video on his own time, Gensomer said the statement it was done without the knowledge of management, and was in no way tied to his work in the firm or our formal engagement on technology for suits with the Obama campaign. It is all standing to the Obama campaign, said the campaign had no knowledge and had nothing to do with the creation of the ad. Blue State Digital separated ties with this individual, we've been assured he had no work on our campaigns account, the Clinton campaign had no major comment. And the interview later in a blog written for the Havana Post, developed express pride and inspiration about acknowledging that his employers are just a point in angry, it means is it is so, it changes the trajectory of my career he said. And posting his blog he wrote, I support Senator Obama, I hope he wins the primary. I recognize that this ad is not a style of politics. Also, I believe Senator Clinton is a great public servant, and if she should win the nomination, I would support her to wish her all the best. Wow. The 74 second fifth, which I'm sure you've both seen it, right? No. I've seen most of it. A copy of an 84 affelad for Macintosh computers recorded nearly 1.5 million views of an enormous surge in the past two, a few days. Two days, the video is filing, which reads, Barack Obama.com, which has no business being on there. It also means hidden for weeks protected by the anonymity afforded by you, and the absence of federal regulations governing most international speech. The ad portrait Clinton on a huge TV screen addressing robotic humans in a stark futuristic hall, a female athlete tosses a hammer at the screen to strengthen his image with an explosive flash. Then this text, on January 14th, the Democratic primary will begin, and you'll see why 2008 is going to be like 1984. Developed a set of useful digital and updated Apple ad that portrayed the female athlete working on iPod. He said he used standard Apple equivalent to modify the video, and it clinton's image in the clip. Obama appearing on Larry King Live Monday night said he's campaigned new nothing about the origins of the anti-clinton ad. Frankly, given what this looks like, we don't have the technical capacity to create something like this. He said it's pretty extraordinary. Developed a set of these Obama supporters was inspired to do the ad after he read reports that Clinton backwards were strong armoured Democrats for money and support. He added, I didn't really like the style of some extended Clinton videos, and the way they were presenting her on the internet. I just thought it was a little bit disingenuous. Just like her, disinfrickened, genuous at fish. The ice princess, Hillary, but nevertheless. Now this is kind of interesting with how we do this to pull it, somebody's sending pretty boring with her right down to it. So that's it. That's all right. I'll ask you, if the new Roger show was yanked off the air between 10 and 2, I would blank. And it's got a listen to Rush, listen to Sadler Radio, listen to 790, the ticket, listen to FM, listen to the very best in the LCDs, watch TV or throw myself off a tall building. Well, I think that's what most people would do is that last choice, throw themselves off well, maybe not at all building. Because I got told to be for it, that's not a good way to do it. Because they may be halfway down to change your mind. Too late, too late, sorry, Mr. Can't do it. Not a good way to go. Pull it through the brain as a way to do it, then. What do you think? To what I hear, yeah? No. Anyway, let's take a look at what we got here. 978 after the break, we're going to have like 1,000 votes. Probably because Josh Corses there today, and I kind of thought it's got the hot spring. He wants you badly, man. He wants you more, there are no words to describe how much he wants you. He wants to fowl you and cuddle you and put you in a corner and tie you up in a chair and just keep you there. Yeah. Just as a friend, this is a companion. Just to hang out. I'm not going to read this again. I just have to read these in disgusting. I don't know if anyone votes. Especially that thing about the, what's the one I keep getting to working? Giving a stool sample and I keep thinking back to that whole deal with that chair. Well, you know, if there were a God, you think we'd be going through things like that if there was really a God. Any of all you religious notes out there, all you guess is stop and ask yourself that question, okay? If there was a God, will we have these horrible things that we have to be involved in? No, unclean. unclean. Oh God. No, what do I mean? I mean, there's Alberto B. O'Fabman's office. We're in the situation with Bill and I say, Salvo P is in a blue closet. Good place for him. In power and defy our United States of Germany. Get out of here. You will lie in little piece of turban. You. Reak those of time I break this way. I would take all the 20% out there's worship ministry. Those of those who've been bold and everything I see about you. You got the labyrinth. You know me when you said me, But you know me that meant it all far. You. I support the truth. Better than. Let me. That China, give them my debt all my ass. You. Please help out upon our bitter info. For the least power, You. Better. You. I don't care. I don't care. But it is you. I never serve my home free. But I sacrifice my waltz in my favor. Now through four three four ships, That's all right. I pay. The wall them can't come. And if the nuttica is, Shower over the sea. I've got no yellow mat in all my ears. I. Who is. I. All in. So. With their. People. I. I. I. Without their. They. I. Got a. They. Get her. Done. For. Last. Get her done. Maybe it's. 18. It's. I don't even know. What is a provost. I do. I remember Claude Proball used to play with the Montreal Canadians. Let's do some hockey talk. You're fairie. What is the provost? Do it a university. Have any idea? I don't. Well, why don't you go. I'm going to Google it right now. PR OVOST. Probost. Oh, really? Is that nice, Bill? What you got the article there? You fasted to me, didn't you? No idea. No, no, that's right. This is a. For a Christmas. Before you came in this morning. It says the sudden and unexpected. The. The. Well, excuse me, that sounds pretty hoony. Twitty to me, huh? They said that I expected a portrait popular. AvA Maria University provost. AvA Maria. Let's play it by Johnny Mathes. Come on. We can do it. Let's get one for the guest. Maybe it's almost each time. And pay. So. See, all new people out there that don't understand what a much a garbage dollar religious stuff is. Have you ever noticed it's not just a coincidence. Okay, because it's all about business. Of course, it's a Jews in the go. They have to have the major holidays. There has to be some like cross dress crossover. Like so each time you got Passover, Paisach, and then a Christmas time you got Chanuka, Hanuka, and it's an interesting how Hanukkah and Christmas both involved the giving of gifts, spending of lots and lots and lots and lots of money, huh? Anyway. These so many expected a departure popular AvA Maria University provost. John Fesio yesterday. Let's do some faculty stunned and upset. Oh, this is from Naples news.com. That's where they've got AvA Maria's in Naples. Well, they have a great stake in Chica here. Not the sonic sonic. Excuse me. No, you a sonic guy? Oh, I'm a huge lot. When I was in Tampa last time I hit it. You hit it. I hit it. Did you get it? Oh yeah. I bet you did. Yeah. So how was it? I love it. I'm about to get a sonic. No, it's great, man. It's open 24 hours. You just pull up people, bring it up. How did so good about it? I think I'm great burgers there. Like how I fall in on a park. I don't know nothing about the burgers. I just know that I got a little breakfast burrito that was fantastic. And they got awesome like little icy, like lemonade icees. That sounds so nice. So yeah, Jesus. Josh, come on. Oh, sorry. I'm giving all these compliments to everything. I'm trying to boost your career here like icees. Like that sounds like so. Jesus. Anyway. Getting back to obviously. And what about I heard the desserts are fantastic there too. I've never been anywhere near a sonic. I wouldn't know when to one bit me on the left. We don't have that here. But we got hot. We have to harvest. And in Tampa they got hearty. See, that's the thing I don't understand. Why does Tampa have so much so many people. So many better restaurants than they'd been rowered. Why am I, is that the old people like to go to restaurants a lot more? No, it's not nothing with old people. Old people go through fast food. That's when you go through the fast food joints over the US old people. You see a young retard who eventually will be old. Trogled, but I have some day, but there young retard. That's one thing, man. The inbreeding on a west coast of Florida is just unbelievable. It must have been less to like spot down from Tennessee. And our can saw. And Mississippi now Alabama. Through all that young who places. It must have kind of sloped down through that inbreeding like wind up on a west coast of Florida. God. So many orange-haired strange people. But they got sonic. And they got steak and shake. Way before steak and shake ever came to South Florida. For years and years and years. And the good thing about the ones in Tampa this steak and shake like that one famous one on Dale Maybrie. Is that the burgers don't all fall apart in like little chunks like they do with certain ones. I got to want to say this steak and shake on sunrise. But the burgers are really good. And the shakes. Oh man. I get the shakes just thinking about it. So you would give sonic what? On the scale of 10. I mean, you know, granted it's fast food, but you know, I would give it a, for fast food. I'd give it a good eight or nine. Hmm. Josh court is an eight or maybe even a five for sonic. I like. You like? I like sonic. Nice. The sun unexpected the departure of popular ava marigina university provost on Fesio. Yes, they left students and faculty still and upset Fesio once they student of the current Pope. Oh my god, was asked to resign as position immediately yesterday. Fesio said that email shortly after 2 p.m. went. They'd remember is of the ava marigina community. Nothing is departure to brief email read to the ava marigina university community. I mean the ava marigina. I've been asked to resign. My position is provostly the campus immediately. Get out of here. You lunatic. I will miss ava marigina. Ava marigina. And the many of you who will I hold dear. Aha. I hold dear. I wonder if there's a comma in that. In a statement university official said Fesio was asked to stand. I wonder if he's came to Tessio. It was asked to step down as a result of irreconcilable differences over administrative policies and practices. Practice makes perfect. You know. The statement is not elaborate. University officials would like Fesio to serve the university and advise me to capacity in the future. Court of the statement. We are grateful for the last the last paragraph of this makes the rest of it worthwhile. So just bear with me. It's coming in a few hours. A grateful for the enormous contributions father Fesio has made the development of ava marigina. University especially to the liturgical and intellectual development of the institution. The statement read. The liturgical and intellectual development of the institution. Laptured. Laptured. Yeah. Laptured as in back home. The third time I feel you cut the crap. University president Nick Helian school father Tom on a hand. Met with students and faculty in private. As they regarding Fesio's dismissal. According to Barbara Lennon University's folks woman. Neither Hilly nor Monahen could be reached later for comment. Fesio also could not be reached. People don't get asked. We send a get fired. said Reverend Michael Bears. Dina they pre-theologic pro. Threatheologate. I don't know how to say that. To a pre-theologate program. Now get out of here. And ava marigina. I was very surprised. I'm totally shocked. Bears said they don't get re-sied. They fired. And here comes the interesting part. The me with the matter. Fesio's dismissal came one day after recent statements. He made were published in article in the California Catholic Daily title. Hey, hey, baby gay. What do you do? What do you say? This is in the California Catholic Daily. This isn't in some like screaming, fat, paper or something. In the California Catholic Daily, the article was titled, hey, hey, baby gay. What do you do? What do you say? What do you say, sweetie? His statement's also published. Marks tooth on the personal website. I wanted the country's pre-menant evangelist leaders. The relevant A. Albert Mowler Jr. and the article Mowler suggested that there was a possibility that a biological basis for homosexuality may be proven is associated with presbyported. Mowler's argument was endorsed by Fesio. That's it. That's it. Now he's coming to the A.D. and the federal and the Fagote days. That's what he's doing. That's why he's out. Hey, hey, baby gay. What do you do? What do you say? I think it's who do you do and what do you say? And what do they say? What do they say? What do they say? Five. Five. Five. Five. Five. Three. No. P cleaned up. You go to that trial and ask for that. You go to the fucking ner crawling but do you do this. Hey, I do the police department. Why Marston you have up curse and you will cry? Why the fuck have I happened and whats next Now you cannot notice about getting back to us to everyone. But keep calling out later. You have up to you. You go from that holy particular matter. And again he has a personal 1000 to vote already. Oh man, what a week on a short and show because of the freaking Marlon game. I wish they got a thousand to vote already. WQA and hello. You know, I must be missing something. You are apparently support the troops means keep them in harm's way. Yeah, okay, right. Yeah, like we don't know that already.

There you go. I don't think you can get it. Okay, I see they're calling. Crystal. I mean, after crystal is anything all that special, but it's, you know, it's one of those little reseovered joints which show you've got to have those to be like a real place, you know? You just got to have that. Right. We had top-hand hamburgers and we had greens in Detroit. We had those places. If you had a bad night at the track and he's all parking, you were all depressed.

I thought you were going to say something else. But nevertheless, we have to admit to everybody little bit whipped up about Lucy. I love Lucy. Some like that. That's what the Kathy Wiltsor always said. 10-20 on a 4-2020 vote. This business of prostitution is illegal and smoking pies illegal and having a good time is illegal. Anything that you might pretty soon they're going to make like a banana split will legal too. Or look at these split. Whatever it is they're going to make it illegal. You'll see.

They want to do it themselves. And especially if it's like underage and especially if it's like all for boys. They want to have a real good hanky spanky ton. But anybody else who wants to have a good ton. Oh, you're going to burn and hell. You have to come and confess to father, tool, and sit in there with his gigantic economy size. You're a Vaseline. Okay. Give me a break. Okay. Any of people that go to confession, you need help. You need mental help.

the town even if he is a pimple the gimp and a limp you've tried last of them is not over the counter prescription drug she says commercial fiber supplements maybe even colonoscopy or surgeries how do you like that back them always to know about why you're still suffering why because the root cause of the problem was never eliminated is that like a little plan words they're never eliminated this this thing goes on for i could be distilled of the middle of the fourth inning at least self-get so what is the root cause of most digestive ailments look at the picture below oh whoa how would you feel as long pieces of old toxin feel fecal matter where stuck to the inside of your colon for months or even years oh my goodness that is nasty you think that picture at that broad on the air with the stomach hanging down is nasty you uh you don't want to see this would you feel constipated bloated and with thargic with your bowels be irritated by this day breed day and then they have causing

irritable ball syndrome constipation gas that we're taking a life in cold or cold cancer or simply not things we like to discuss not a polite company like us and yet as the old expression goes death begins in the colon you know that guy's death begins in the colon yeah but I heard yeah that's what they see in outer space death begins on your heinous don't believe it ask any corner oxyzof and reveal colon's that are plugged up to 80 percent with waste material oh that's what the vegetarian time says what do they know you can stop suffering in silence from these painful often embarrassing health conditions by learning how body pollution and toxic colon can be the cause of all this and indoctrinated once to say that after reading another seven zillion oh looking at these gross pictures of all they're not really pictures they're all drawing is all these parasites that are crawling around inside your body and then the disgusting thought yes if there are parasites inside I think I got a tapeworm every time I get hungry for ice cream I think I have a tapeworm that's just dying for like bastard robbing or something like that which I did go to the day went to gnc i told a story but you weren't there I went to gnc to get my co-futant with some other vitamins and then I go to basket bastard robins you know and get a three-stoo brachy road hot fight sunday well I mean if you're going to take it some for your health and then you're eating ice cream on your no vibe but it's like me that's not good no it's like you're telling me to go to sonic next time I'm in Florida and get a whole bunch of stuff in a banana split to top it all off to get some grease they have been in a split yes they do like Allen's pharmacy on red and the bird that's the place I was trying to thank you moishi by the way Allen's pharmacy that would ice cream your at these days the rocky road but anyway Allen's when we were at I would do they came in because I used to be able to go about the great banana sports because they have the old fashioned fountain in there now it's pharmacy went to last ago and anywhere and it said red and bird and they brought in tubs of ice cream they made George and made it as banana splits right there in the studio they brought all the fixens you know and the accoutrements and stuff yeah what's wrong with rocky road you know anybody does like rocky road especially if it's made right and that's a little marshmallows and you know the little all-in-one love it in my right my favorite what's not to like baby rocky road no once I'm just16. I had to quit from paper Basket race So I said crap together on red right now crash you AS Because it was Сегодня quad break up all the these little thing right now running quick Rock you say, she's on that great life gravy with huh? Please look what fault they are doing, I sound like well-meat You kinda got that I want to do, that's really good to eat I want to give you the one-day, but there's no chance at all So don't let me hear sports quiz, if I want to see you grab them all Okay At least until we're 28 I'm great now, rock solid I want to win, you wait, you don't let it play by gravy We're there, you're out, you're got that shit You wait, you don't let it play by gravy At how great he's on, he's to busy anyway, I'm pregnant here, we have chicken in the world He wants to be the father of the universe, I guess But even a clean cut guy like Tom Brady is doing you know what? Ten seventy three on a pole So the bad news is, my buddy Steven says that Picknex Diner in Allen's ain't there no mole It's separated move down the street, now do you have any idea what that means? I don't understand what that means, it's separated What? I never heard of it to begin What does that mean that Picknex Diner, I don't even know what that means? What does that mean? You know what that means? No Because, see what's the pot of time? I know a lot of you young punks aren't familiar Because you know old and the people and go to that pretty soon like me But the fact that the matter is, once the pot of time Most of your pharmacies like that hotel pharmacy, remember that Chris I was talking about that day When I found out money on the street, I found my me beach, I found like two five hour bills And I went in and had me a nice cheeseburger and a banana splitter something What? Thought I was a twenty-two Well, whatever the hell, it wasn't one bill, it was like, I don't know, maybe a couple of five and three singles I think it was more like a thirteen lucky thirteen That was one of the most bizarre experiences I mean, not that I was like a pop or anything, but I just didn't have any cash And a bank, the ATM at the flagship bank, there on old and road wasn't working And I couldn't give me no cash And of course, you think that I had credit cards back in those days Oh, yeah, the KAT days, making two hundred and twenty five bucks a week That fell out of money What? Two twenty five week after you would be Well, I had a budget of my money, man I said, I have a lot of money for picking up all my hustlers on this game, Boulevard You know, so it's a matter of priorities Now, let's see, here's what Moishi says, the dining room inside moved across the street It's not in Allen's anymore, that's okay Okay, I'll take whatever you guys have to take your word for it But like I'm starting to say, is that just about any pharmacy Even Woolworths, remember Woolworths? No, get out of here, like five and dime stores Knives, there is five and dime, and Woolworths, come on You're starting to make me feel like some kind of an old fart here today Hmm, I'll be able to update on that picnic's place Okay, what does that mean? That was the name of a diner inside Allen's rug, rug's or whatever And they, I guess, said, you know, what? We're too good at just the inside of this place So they moved out across the street, own place I see, that's care of the beast Well, thanks beast, all my correspondence out there, all the food experts are feed me all this stuff But the phone I was trying to make is that when George and I talked about it See this is back in the day when A, we were like on a real radio station It wasn't just talking about ball games and draw stripes and B, we had audience Oh, oh, I long for those days That I would be, and so we'd go on the year and we'd talk about Just about any kind of business establishment with food and before you know it there they would be And so we're even about, because back in the day that diner was still inside the Allen's drugs It was one of the last in town, maybe the last in town had that old fashioned diner, you know Where you go in and the old soda jerk would be standing behind the counter, if it's the soda jerk, but anyway Well, look at that Thursday, the latest CNN guy Clinton's 37.
