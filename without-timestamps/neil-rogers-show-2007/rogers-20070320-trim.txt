How he… Ohhh! Doesn't really know Dork Duallens Sorry to hear that waksawling Unless i'm a fucking ma Paul baine The time and time they'll get to And Nows I thought when you've been into it, Kevin with a K-Mod, Oh, it's quit and time became odd And going to the point you've got to K-Mod, get fired out of the way! No more pills on two shots, but I'm there with it! No more fates and slippers, too! 99 a pair! No more of those cheap chefs you've played these days! You've got to not come and back to K-Mod, every with a K-Mod, Oh, now it's quit and time became odd And going to the point you've got to K-Mod, get fired out of the way! There's the word SWAT come to mind, huh? But I used to shot, but when I was there, you know, back in the day when I was there six, seven years ago, I've traveled to K-Mod, just to piss off the people Walmart, you know? Yeah, I do that with time. Not to pay pay to any attention, but I shouldn't have had a big sign. Hey, I'm your rod, there's no shop in it. K-Mod just because I can't stand you back to do their Walmart. And they were going to say, yeah, who cares? Who cares if that old faggot? That's what they were going to say. By the way, got a fact yesterday afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, this is quite a day today for me. This is a revolutionary day. This is two in a row. Now, what was yesterday was such a big deal about? I don't know, it was hard to run. So Monday or so, we're early, early, release day. Well, that's right. We had the unexpected Marlins Astros game. How'd that come out Chris? Who won a game? Anybody here? No. They lost four two. Oh, the Marlins lost. Oh, the Marlins. We don't care. And today is a revolutionary. Every day just keeps bringing bigger and better and more wonderful news. The sun is shining. It's going to be, let's see what the temperature isn't. Case-castronable. Once it's all right, it's on a sleeve and put it on the show tomorrow. Let's see. Oh, it's minus 10. It looks really nice sitting here. Look at outside. What's that? It's going to be only a zero, but sunny. It's beautiful. Come on. It's going to be five, which is 41 and Thursday. It's going to be 18 Celsius. All right. 65 degrees. But that's going to be a good day for me to do the show. Running around naked in my boss's shorts outside on the street. Wouldn't it be good? Yeah, it would be take that cordless mic with you. Now, I could do it. So yesterday, I knew it. I'd get, let's see, what's the time of this? I don't know what it is. I don't know. I don't know. It's funny because it says, 1144A, and which is not the correct time. No, I guess the fact machine has the wrong time on it. Must be on. Or what does it mean? One minute after the end of the show. No, two or one, yes, to have to know. And I get a fast from George Rodriguez. And it says, it's from the script of the godfather. And it says, salvage our testio brings in look of Rossi's bulletproof vest. Delivered with a fish inside. Sunny, Santino, says, what the hell is this? And then look of grassy, slip, shard of fishes. It says, city and message, it means look of Rossi's slip to the fishes. Says, peak cleanser. Right. And George right now, I looked it up. You're right. I'm wrong. Well, that's pretty powerful to course at it. Is that the world works? That's a wrong right. All the time, just ask me not to. I mean, what's in a while, I get it right. Not too often. Look of grassy, slip, shard of fishes. Let's just play that all day. Right. Yeah, right. And look of grassy, slip, shard of fishes. Can't you tell by the... Well, Rossi, slip, shard of fishes. She says, got anybody that's seen him movie six, seven times like we all have. And you don't know that's Clemenza. In fact, I want you to listen, let's see. Cannoli, let's try my own. I got it 400 drop ins on here. Now let's all get some tests from that. You know, get some tests, you know. So you can hear how they sound. We all have an E test, you know. We gotta have that. Forget about what's the elicent. Leave it, got it. Take the connolly. Sounds good. They're pretty pretty. Sounds different. You gotta have the, the get me off the... He even certainly won't be able to call out. Look of Brassie. Yeah. Well, let me worry about, look at it. You know, the interesting part about this thing is that all these years we would call him look up Brassie and his name is B-A-S-I Brassie. Yeah, it's Brassie, which I never knew that. Lucky in Brassie, right? In fact, even in the V-C-S here, it's got look up Brassie under Stone coil. Under that drop. I put it that. That commensal line because commensal says Brassie. Is that it? You guys? I do have to find it again. Yeah. I just got off at that damn section here. Now you're gonna make me go back there again. Yes. Or commensal. Look up Brassie. She's free. Brassie. Brassie. Brassie. Brassie. Brassie. Brassie. There, let's start Paul Italiani on the issue, huh? There we go. Yeah, ma'am mia. That's just face in me, Paul. Bambam mia. Anyway, let's get this thing going to do now. Everybody to call in yesterday's invited to call back again today and then some. We had a short what? That was great. That's my kind of show. See if you can say something different today too. That'd be really good. Now I like the guy that young guy to call in. I don't want to say kid. I don't know how old he was. It meant to me anybody under 80 as a kid. But he said, I don't know what I'm supposed to say. That was good. Maybe he'll call back and see that again today. What do you think? Maybe he'll have some of this. I'm kind of refining. I'm refining with show. I'm just not refining. I'm just retuning it. I'm rejigering it. Can I say that? No. No. I'm re-tooling it. I don't think I can say that either. Retuning. I'm fine. WDQAM. Hello. Dolphin Denny. Calling from the other side. Dolphin Denny is dead. Yeah, we had that story yesterday and a lot of people had parties overnight. That's bad. WDQAM. Hello. Leo. Yeah. A question for you. You remember Mary's restaurant out there in, uh, Sure, 155 and um, 441. I used to live right by their Twinites Racken Club. I've heard you talk about my team. I've heard there. Yes. Do you remember the retorted, uh, boss quality used to work there? No, but I remember one of the waiters was a, uh, a, uh, training. I, uh, I, uh, I, uh, I. I, uh, I, uh, I. I, uh, I, uh, I. I, uh, I. I, uh, I. I, uh, I. I, uh, I. I called my aunt one day, uh, years ago. There was one. And they'll front of my youth work there years, four years, eight, Bobby 40 years old still bumping tables. And he said one of the waiters is there was sucked up mean, middle, maybe she challenged him to a fight. What? Yeah, I must have been this one. I must have been to your guy. Anyway, I thought you to remember that. I heard, I think I've heard you talk about future. I love Mary's. It was good that we had the great pizza. Mary's, but of course it's long gone now. Maybe the cell and fried chicken there now or something like that. It wasn't like kind of an ethnic comment. There wasn't no just changing neighborhoods. It's like, uh, Washington Avenue on the beach. Used to be the famous restaurant. All old Jews used to be there going, oh, oh, hey, like that. And now it's all old Cubans over there. Or Washington. Kind of. It's domino. Well, the Cuban restaurant. That's what the famous became. Yes, I'm Washington Avenue. I don't know. It's your territory. It is not. No, and not us. I was there with just what you are sure. I was going to back in my parade today. I haven't been in this good of a mood since, uh, I've been in this good bin last about 100 years ago. I'm trying to think that I ever win a woodbond. I sure can't remember that. It's getting boring. It's getting really monotonous. What I need. That's it. What I need right now. You know, my friend that I met in Berlin last December. I have no idea what his name is. But it hunts. Hunts. Yeah. It's a hunts on the car. Whatever the name was. That's what I need to show up here. You're not going to do it on a weekend. Like, said, or do you want to say, oh, forget about going to a woodbond. I'll just combine and entertain you all weekend. No, that's what I need. It would be just fine. WQAM hello. Oh, yeah. He is really completely, really. On that's him. Oh, yeah. That is him. WQAM hello. Oh, I went up the Georgia Regan. Yeah, about what? Oh, it's not the question. Am I in here? Yeah. Oh, no. Oh, we have to go. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry about it. No, go ahead. Excuse me, sir. Why don't you get a female? For one. Uh, just a few minutes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, go ahead. Just from asking a question about something. Well, well, one. I've got to know. Poor hay at Neil Rogers. No, come on. Yeah, I'm all right. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, come on. That's true to know. If I wanted to hear what the question was. Don't worry. I'll tell you what the question is when he sends me the. Oh, my god. That is so bad. You know, the little teas. Yeah, we have a new format on the show now. But I do. Here's the full. I want to take at least 4,000 calls a day. I was inspired to do this by some of my kind of a couple. I'm a couple of my consultants out there. 14, 12 votes on the 40th day over the last 10 years, what is QM's best morning show. And the answer was on all buzz me now. Don't tap. Oh, oh. And they all sucked to 25. They all sucked. That's bad. Howard Stern 2006 before. Well, I do remember those days when Duff was sitting in there with those headphones. Look at like a real lady. Wow. Look at like a real lady that she is. that she is. But anyway, that's ancient history. Howard Stern, a little bit we carry it up at. Oh, Howard's playing far together, you better. Yeah. For RAL, 200 for RAL. The second first team, Defoe Joe Rose and Gellie, even though everybody hates Defoe like Poison 194, the original first team, which what did you tell me was it was the Dave Lamont and Jimmy Cifless? Correct. I've been 47 for them. And I don't know from that. Hank 109. As in PT 109, it's Hank 109. I hate this full 82, a mere 5.8%. That's not bad. More on Gellie, that's really 50. That's pretty weak. Kenny and Boa, the morning show, which is what we got now, avoided last place on this, which is thankful for that 25, was pretty weak though. 1.7%. Percent. What is seem to be really stuck on that number, you know, 1.7% 25 votes for the Kenny and Boa morning show. When they change the shape of that table, man, it's going to change the shape of radio for years to come. And Defoe Gellie, the broad and the other guy, only 16, bringing up the rear as they say in the radio, but it's bringing up the rear. You're going to see man, we're turning the corner. I'm so full of them and you know, vinegar and whatever goes with vinegar today, you can't even believe it. Can you? I don't know, start to the pee. Yeah, pee. Don't be a pee on. It's one thing if somebody wants to pee on you, but don't be a pee on. What do they call those flowers? Pienes. Pienes. No, Pienes. Seriously. I don't believe me. I know Pienes. I know Pienes. They're like aren't they yellow and whatever? Don't know. You better start learning your flowers, Mr. because you know how squash you want to come to flowers. I don't. And Chris, the good news is we got 800, 800 votes on today's pool already. We haven't even started yet. We got no dropouts on the stream. Thanks, God. So we're here today's pool and we start out with Georgia meeting for once. This is the first time I think in 17 years. I was right and George was wrong. Ghostly Charlie, if you keep plugging away, plugging away sooner or later, just by luck of the draw. Look, Nebraska sleeps with the fishers. Hello, nice college boy. They want to get mixed up in the family business. And now you want to go down a police captain like us. He's lapsed in a face a little bit. What do you think? This is the only way you shoot him a mile away. You gotta get a post like this. The thing you put in friends all over your nice side, Relic suit. Come in. You're taking a very far. Now where did this come from? Did somebody actually come in and do this? I think I would be on here. Remember that Rick and Sudwood have musical guests in and we're now in again. This is the childhood. Yes, Valerie, Don Kuchen, Wet Cup, would cut it out. Valerie, Von Kuchen, would cut the harpist over. Oh, this is the chalice. The harp lady was Valerie. I forget this guy's name because he's fat nugly, but Valerie was pretty sorry, remember her name. Oh, don't want to end on a sour note. I think he had a big. Oh. You're fair, Valerie. Lovin. Okay, 10 18. Don't start getting gone father and tentative again to the audience. We'll turn on you like a cornered rat. You'll say, no, they want. 9 every one votes on the pool already. Why, but your Chris is really the sour relief. And don't don't you dare, start talking about this. Oh, does this a different kid? This missing from a front party. We got more missing kids going on. Inside Owen Hall, it's not known if the body is that of the 19 year old. Oh, no. It's just going on at this hour. So we should learn more. See that that kind of retarder looking kid that went in the hills and disappeared North Carolina. I don't really care much about him. But all body fun and utility clubs at a Purdue university. That's bad. Because this could look pretty good. But anyway, see the good looking people you guys can stay alive and those of us did people. I mean, no, no. 901 on the pool of somebody from out of town visits South Florida make sure they don't miss blank. And look what's women here. Looky, looky, looky here comes cookie as Rinery would say if he were alive or he's not. The new rangers show 262. What did I tell you about? Legendary Neil God. What I tell you? If somebody from out of town visits make sure they don't miss this show 262, I would advise them not to come. That was my vote. That's a very close second to 61. Forget about it. That would be my best suggestion. Anybody out there whose chamber of commerce hates me, but I don't, you know, feelings mutual. If you're thinking about visiting South Florida, but got about it. Right. That's the best advice. South Beach 180. I hate this pool. 52. Only 5.7% will take it. Not bad. Sogress mills mall 32. No, say I'm laying place. I eat. Oh, no. No chance. If you can't afford to go all the way to Brazil, just go to the sawgrass. 32 for the sawgrass. That's pretty said, come on. You know, little have an at 23. Oh, you don't want to miss that. Oh, the early bird dinner 18 tied with cemetery village 18. In fact, you can start it cemetery village and take some of the old cochers up and treat them to an early bird. The jungle queen dinner cruise 18. The my guy 16, which is still there. Put none of those it's still a tourist trap. There used to be that great Italian restaurant right to the next door to it or almost next door called and then it became like a strip club. Gigi's. Remember I'm going to time out talking about that place. Gigi. Yes. Oh, that's about 100 years ago. Man, it was good. That was back in the 60s. Gigi's. But now the my guy is still there. 18 16. Monkey jungle 11 and the Metro Zoo will need 10. Boy, Ryan McGill ain't going to be happy with us on that. And Chris hates Ryan McGill like poised anyway for some reason. Yeah. What is it because you think he's a jackass? He's funny. Fony, funny, voloni, which rhymes with bony, Moroni, uh oh. He's funny in what way. But your cameras on or there's, you know, puts on a good act. Exactly. And then when the camera's on, he was slapping animals around a little bit. I don't know about that. Well, good. So there we go. 9 and 13. Go. So we got a thousand. Look, not even that foot. And it's back to the top of the first hour today. Doug Thompson, do I hear we this from capital and he'll do well. Because once we get these calls man, it's going to be a heavy hit. Right. 22. And what's going on? Hello. New God. Yes, sir. Mary's restaurant. Now, Creole, cuisine. What does that tell you? Changing hoods man. Hey, I'm a third generation listener. And what's very disappointed yesterday when the marlins came on, I had to push me. And I pushed the button and went over to Sid Rosencreen's stance, you know, towards you. David is boyfriend. And he was talking about the odds of who was going to win dancing with the stars. All right. Hi, Patrick. Thanks for the good news. That is beyond pathetic. Thank you very much. And of course, Sid Rosencreen's you keep it up dancing with a star. That's worth that. Anyway, Doug Thompson says I'm trying and failing to understand by me the press gave an indebted former member of Congress a corrupt politician resigned in disgrace. A forum upon which the response hate and division Sunday as President Bush's illegal and immoral Iraq war enters its fifth year. His Tim Rasser is so desperate for controversy that he has to book Tom Delay easily one of the most criminal political hacks in Washington on the top right at Sunday news talk. Show him, let him call war protesters unpatriotic and claim that anybody wants to end the Iraq war is eating and abetting the enemy. Delay is political vrooming. One step away from a jail cell for influence peddling and taking crimes and yet there he was on eat the press being treated with difference by laughed dog russert. Instead of pretending to do any standard of journalism or decency, russert like Delay expand and why he thinks those who protest the war are not patriots. Said Delay, well, it's my opinion that when you go to war, we ought to all come together. So to speak, we can debate going toward that's legitimate debate. But once you have our soldiers and our our young people dying on the battlefield, we should come together and we shouldn't have what we had yesterday on the mall in Washington, D.C. When those are not in my mind, my opinion patriots that are talking about impeaching the commander in chief. When asked if he thought congressional attempts to set it with drull, they forgetting the hell out of Iraq fell into the same category as the leader applied. I think it's eating and abetting the enemy. When you tell the enemy what your strategy is, that's eating and abetting the enemy because they can use their strategy to come back and harm your soldiers. Russet who some feel as a strong interview will likely walk all over him. When he tried to question Delay on his praise and failed former secretary of defense rumsfeld, Delay shot back, the premise of your question is always put forward without the rest of the story and maybe we ought to have Paul Harvey here to talk about the rest of the story. Good day? Russet said nothing and didn't push to get answered to his question and steady went to another guest. It's bad enough that corrupt slime like Tom Delay remained in Congress as long as he did. It's worse that after his many crimes finally cut up with him and he was forced to resign by his own Republican colleagues, he's then given a podium on a national news show to continue his hate-filled die-attribes. His claim that we ought to all come together as political hypocrisy of the worst kind of Congress, Delay thrived and dividing and conquering, he refused to cooperate, worked to destroy any attempted coalition building. Tom Delay is a crook. He was so corrupt that even in the past Republican leadership of Congress itself the most corrupt and modern times they could no longer tell where it is present. Tim Russet is not a journalist. He's a political hack, an unpracticing lawyer who worked for New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and New York Governor Mario Cuomo. Crooks belonging in jail not on television, political hacks belonging in the dustbin of history. Tim Russet owes his viewers in a apology for giving a crook national form, then he owes journalism a decency to resign and let somebody with real credentials take over eat the press. Nice going, Doug. How do you real feel? I'm a real feel. We feel this. I like that. He's good. He's a fucking love of these days that we're going to say, oh, I don't know. I'm going to open it up Thompson. You know, they tried to drag his answer way that one time. Remember? They ever find the cave he's hiding in. Yeah. Well, he's probably hanging out with a caveman. God only knows what they're doing in there. Oh, dancing. You're all in common East is. That would be a good poll question. How much? How much would they have to pay? We would have sex with the caveman with a pissed off caveman. Oh, good. How many how many million? About 30 million for me. Even then I don't think I could handle it. Well, 925 and a full Chris is dancing because I was excited about this. He's real whipped up about the days when we don't have to worry about pushing for that thousand archa. Yes. Oh, yeah. That's love. Just pretend you are. Okay. Two o'clock. It's the mad dog. 4 to 5. It's the power hour with mad dog only, which I don't know. I don't know why just doesn't say 2 to 5 gym and it's because when Hank isn't around, which is today, there is the amends just stupid. It's what it is. Thirsty thing again. That's you. Stupid. Compassed. Any cave 5 to 6 30 when people are actually awake driving home. Any cave. Panther preview of 6 30. Panthers that they fill the obvious flyers that should be a walk over 7 o'clock today must win situation. Any chance of those playoff? No. Any interest in town? No. We love the pan to remember those days. What was your name? Joel in. Joel in. Joel in Daniel. Wow. We don't have that in here though, doing. I think it's on a mini disk. It is on a mini disk somewhere. But we do have this. This is Brett Heddykin and you're listening to South Florida's hockey authority Neil Rogers. Thanks, Brett. Remember him? The makers of queer eye for the street guy. It's queer eye for the omnisch guy. This is what it's frightening. Where you got this? My wife made it for me. Our job is to make you more sophisticated.

Which is that picture? You don't look all I could any more. So I don't feel that bad. So Wade Steffi K. 19 years old Purdue University student. He thought that he was getting into the coke closet. To get his coat out. Coat. Oh, he coat. Coat, coat, coat as in a coat of the same. So he had a coat closet. And anyway, so he went into a open room was a transformer in there. Was like some other closet and he got electrocuted. He got fried. He got fried, man. That's bad. That sucks. Well, the most college kids get fried sooner or later. He used much as they can. Generally. Okay, now let's get these phones fried up here. Maybe because I want to have just like we had yesterday. Only we had a short show yesterday. So we had to cut off a lot of good entertainment. I want to see if the audience can do it. Okay, if they can come through now, then maybe they're once in a lifetime thing. You know, you never know for sure. 567560, pound 560 and they've arrived in singular, wireless line. Let's see how long we can keep it going.

Because he doesn't own one anymore, I guess. Stick to the TV crap. Stick to all those prefabricated articles about the fall TV shows. Okay. Because they keep winding and dining him out there in LA a couple of times a year. To preview the new shows and write a bunch of puff pieces about. This show is going to be great. This show is going to suck. That's really. It's very entertaining time. Not once upon a time we had people write about radio and TV. Right about what was happening on the local scene. You know, and here I said 1200 miles away and I got a better. I got a better grasp of what's going on and he's got. Because he's too busy worried about, you know, about algorithm global warming.

See what I said about I don't think they can do it again today. And it was only a short show yesterday. Of course, I think they're probably figuring out a top at last guy with the David Schrogerman's mother. Whatever it was talking about. They don't have to. No pressure. They don't have to top it. That's right. No pressure man. Whatever you got. I really don't know what to say. That's good enough. Okay. For this show now. From this day forward. Okay. Mark it down on your arm like the guy in Momento. Tuesday, March 20th. Federal, luckily he'll come down here and says, You don't have that many materials. Just pick up that phone. Okay. If we can motivate you to call that to start. And then one of these days, maybe you will have a material. Unlikely, but just keep working at it. Practice makes perfect. Five five six seven. Five six seven. Five six. What's this delay? Kids, is that manual see there be a cover to one there? I mean, this is always a short one. Hello. That was a short one. WQA and hello.

Oh Jesus God and there's this sign of a highway that says, I 95. I wonder what that means. God are you people dumb. Jesus Christ. How many calls have we had about that stupid doorboard there? I will say this, at least they got billboards and there are some people noticing them. Yeah. That's right. That's right. I think that if we stop buying staples in paper clothes, maybe we can afford enough or like a Not a billboard or like a poster, you know. Like the gal can walk up and down Lincoln Road, Malwood. They have one of those, what do they call those thing, a sandwich board. A sandwich board on his ass. That's it. Or just to say the thing. He can go ass boarding. WQA and hello. Yeah. These people with the billboards are sharpest act. They would sell. What is it? Yeah. What with dolphin Danny gone. Is that kind of like, um, embossed when they blew up that bass ball and all the luck came back to a red fox. Yeah. Kind of like that, right. Maybe that's an oldman. Maybe the dolphins are going to have a big season now. The dolphin Danny bit the dust. That's a terrible thing to say about a guy that was there for a very long time. Even though most fans hated him like poison, but nevertheless, WQA and hello. My favorite ice cream is Rocky Road. So, I like them. WQA and hello. After all these years Chris, finally, I'm still with these guys. And after all these years, we still can't say deep agonnier. How do you like that? Yeah, I don't. I don't either.

Just said that is a diabetic. You have diabetes, right? That is correct. Because he is obviously a pretty obese and he draws like 58 pounds in five months. This is a medication. It's sort of like an in little injectable. It's called bayda. Have you heard of it? No. Yeah, it's for type two. And basically you inject this twice a day. I don't know what it's doing in, but it's actually reduced to sugars. That means about like 50 pounds. Well, how did you know what it has to do with losing the weight taken? All right. A daily, it does something to your brain that says that you tell your brain that you're full. You don't eat that much? Really? Yeah, yeah. So it's, you know, it's like about b y e t t e. Okay. I'll go steal some of the day. All right. Thanks, proud. By you. I see him not injecting anything. I take oral medication. Can I say oral on your own? Oh, sorry. There's a fine. There's a fine. Yeah. It's a fine. All we're fine. I sound fine to me. Anyway, just take pills. I don't take, I don't inject. Once you start injecting, I think that's like for sure, one day you're going to die. I mean, I don't want to say any time soon. Look at this. Look at looking. Look at here comes cookie. 995, baby. What an explosive day this is. Man. 995. We got carried away.

What does that mean? What does that mean? What does this point of why? You want to go to bed with him? Is that it? Get out of here. You little madacone. But got wrong. Many act. What does this point mean? Because Steve Stone is one of them madacone. In fact, when he was doing the cub games with Harry all the time, I thought it was. Harry, he used to just make... Yeah, he would make funny comments on the year. Because he knew that Steve Stone was as close to being out as you posit. He had one leg out of the other one foretoes out. You know what I mean? And Harry will make some comment about how Steve was going to have to start making babies, and having children and Steve says, I don't think it works that way, Harry. I don't think it works that way, Harry. I don't think it works that way. I don't think it works that way. I don't think it works that way. I guess you got to find a white first.

And bring that to my pleasure. No, okay. Another program or right there. Okay. If I asked somebody for programming advice, that's one thing. Okay. And then that's great. I asked certain consultants out there who are like real fans of the show, who understand the ins and the outs and the ups and the down the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the crap. But when somebody starts calling, unsolicited and giving me a song to dance, or like when somebody else out there starts saying, hey, play all the other day. Hey, Chris, cut the crap. Okay. If it was up to him, I would just play all the other endless looper. We did a whole four hours. Sounds like a plan though. WQAM. Hello. What do you mean? Funny. You know what? WQAM. Hello. WQAM. Hello. QAM. Hello. QAM. Hello. Yes. I have a question about your poll. When you say the monkey jungle are you referring to liberty city? 560, 560. As soon as he calls, he would know Doug.

You didn't see that? No. To a Nazi bitch and stuff like this. And all these people are like blowing up into the world as coming to win it. And at the end, it says a Barack Obama campaign, which of course it's not. But that's the kind of crap that winds up on the internet. You wait and see Mr. You ain't seen nothing yet. You're going to see a political lynching that they're going to try and him like you have never dreamed in your wildest imagination. You'll see anyone in the line? Why? Because it's the American I've been waiting. This kid that you said is that he's alive. He's able to walk. He's got about a mile and a half from can't. Life goes on. CNN has spent hours and hours.

Make sure they don't miss the legendary Nearodges show. They'll come. 111, boy. Man. I'm hanging out of the chair with both hands. I would advise them not to come to 97. South Beach, 225. I hate this pool 61 only 5.4% they likes it. In fact, when we start to pull a bit, we should ask. You like it. Uh, saw grass mills, mall 36 and little of Anna. Look how many little of Anna's got.

I paid by I would just not go wet by two. 1129 in the pool. 1145 in the clock. How do you like that? Tick-tock. It's 1145 in the clock. It's almost noon. We'll be on here by two. Not that I'm counting you understand. Right. To the ballgame. To the marlins. Yeah. The marlins. Marlins at the cartels. It's 12.5 on Thursday. Mm-hmm. My mind. Here's a nice pool suggestion from our friends at university. Dodge. You don't do any work down there at all. I like this pool suggestion. If I could be somebody else for one day. We never did this before. I did it. I did it. I was similar one word if you could trade lives with someone. But like permanently. This is a good one. If I could be somebody for just one day. Right. I would be. I'd be build gates because then I read them out like, I'll bunch and check to myself on the next day. Go back to BME. Yeah. Or if it next day, I'd go back to being like, uh, Great and quay. I'd go back to being Brady Quinn. Mm-hmm. I'll tell you one thing. If I was Brady Quinn for a day, I'd be real busy. I'll tell you that. Mm-hmm. My mind. Look out now. I'd be real busy. And look at this George W. Bush. Look at the names they have on you. You want to be George W. Bush for one day? God. These. Bill Clinton's sworey. Wayne Heisinger. You know? Wow. That changed your complexion. I guess Tiger Woods. That would also probably change most of your complexion. When I sounded like a racial comment to me, let's get your rose on it. Few have no. Neal Rogers. Oh yeah. They all got. Howard sperm. Anybody who, but who I am. That certainly in South Florida, that would definitely go for big one. We did this pool. I gotta be me. Ha ha ha ha ha. I gotta be me. All right. That's great. I can hear Sammy Davis singing that. Who sings I gotta be me. I don't know. You got it? I'll see. Now you got the songs out of the past, only by our taste. Uh, all of the about. I see. And I hate this pool. That's not a bad one. Now you think I have to give the phone numbers again on the dog food thing. This is, you know, very seriously. We have a lot of dual lovers out there. And the fact that word dog lovers. If there's menu foods, is got two phone numbers that pet owners who are coughing from age before you go poisoning your dog. You can't, ah, go ahead and give it a shot. You don't put your dog. 866. And by the way, something to me. Who is it? You will write the first time. Sammy. Sammy. This is what I'm saying. Sammy, Sammy. Sammy Davis soon. When you arrived, you're going to be the, Sammy Davis do I. I'm no place in this world. We had high perlating. That's the only one. Who? I got it. Be me. A precarious day. Yeah. That's a thing. Pet owners can call for information before you go pausing poisoning your dog. 866. 463. 6738. Or 866. 865. 278. Now, a lot of people say they can't get true because every step of getting Ziggins calls from people out of an appendix. About the Yucanuba and Iems and a lot of these other dog foods. And of course, it's a Canadian plot. Probably from that fascist, Stephen Harper who wants to be bush light. You know, now that Nazi bastard, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Oh. 866. 463. 6738. Or 866. 868. 95. 278. I'll give it again later. I would do that. Okay. To do that. I hate to forget. Now, this story about Jewish Porter Chris, is this old news or is this something I should mention by Ellis Marves, you think it was by Ellis Marves? We know about it. Leave us like two days ago. So I shouldn't bother with it. In this case. Well, I've met him in yesterday. I thought he had his piano yesterday afternoon recently signed off. And line back. Roy Porter didn't need long to live up to his reputations. One of the NFL's most controversial players. It says he was set it for misprominor battery Sunday night. After allegedly punching another NFL player in the face. And a Vegas casino. Hey, he used to go to Vegas alive. Oh, no. Porter had a brief altercation with Cincinnati Bengals left tackle. Levi Jones. Levi is coming. Reset Eli is coming. He's a big dog night. Eli. How about Levi, Harner? He's been dead. How many years? Well, the gaming table that Poms, Cacino Vegas police department spokesman Martin Wright said. Wright said Jones who chose to press charges received unsegmentical treatment for a small cut. Jones also claimed several of his gold chains were stolen during the melee. A source said the six five feet of in some found Jones is telling those close to him that he was jumped at the table. My six other people were with Porter. The source of Jones is thinly was in the back of the hand by one of Porter's ass associates. Just before being punched in the push by the six three 250 pound line backer. Roy's on the boys, you know. Roy's on the boys. You're fair. And take showers naked together. And snap each other on the ass with towel. Stuff like that. Like I want you overgrown children. Number 136 votes on the poll. You have any doubt we'll get to 13 every day. I don't confidence is confidence is running pretty high. Now this high is you are but confidence is high. No wish. Now what is this story from La Paz Bolivia? La Paz. I don't know how they talking Bolivia. Is it all good? Look at Brassie. I think that's pretty outrageous to where for all these years we've become look at Brassie. And we're wrong. Good story on. I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding. Isn't very scary guy. The farmers and women says always co-concolon not a Bolivia's co-corrosive. They're way. The farmers want to work co-ca, dropped by the US after in company arguing that the potent shrub belongs to the cultural heritage of this Andian nation Bolivia. Or the co-co-leaf in closing the Andian life. I got to Indian music. Or the co-co-leaf in fuses everyday life in a sacred domain. That's Indian music. It sure is. I see. I'm not talking about innocent Indian music. A commission of co-conduers can be represented as advising and assembly rewriting Bolivia's constitution passed a resolution. Last week, calling on the Atlanta-based company to take co-co-co out of its name, asking the UN to decriminalize the leaf. Go leaf, go. The resolution demands international companies that include in their commercial name, the name of co-co-referring from using the name of their sacred leaf in their products. Yes, and how much is co-a? Would you care for a co-a? Or I don't like that co-co-co- anyway, so they can't really say it. I hope whatever they want, how about they call it co-co-a? Yeah, how about the uncool? See, Pepsi-co-a works fine with me and they're not upset about that. That's all I'm not drinking here. I don't know. I'm drinking die-co-co-co-co-caffeine. I explain to him how I'm so hopped up today, like a Mexican jumping bee. The commission which went for three days in the super-at 255 miles southeast of La Paz is part of an effort led by President Eva Morales to rehabilitate the image of the plant used in the Andean and the East for millennia, but they're known as the basin we knew co-cane. We better send our fan Ask Governor's daughter to check it out. I'll go with it. Coca-Cola stated last week its trademark is the most valuable and recognized brand in the world baby and is protected under Bolivian law. Don't be mess with our Coca-baby. The statement repeated the company's past analysis that Coca-Cola's ever used cocaine is an ingredient, but with sound on our natural Coca-Cola he was used to flavor the soda. They need to understand our situation said David Herrera, a state government supervisor for the Coca-rich Shapata region. They exported to Coca-Cola and we can't even freely sell it in Bolivia. Who would have wants a little Bolivia anyway? The Bolivian government regulates the sale of cocaine from and used by the drug trade and its natural state to greenleaf is only a mild stimulant. Let me see, I got it in here. What's that? Malt stimulant. In my glass. In Bolivia. I only win. I only win. I only win. I only wish. In Bolivia's white color offices, Coca-Cola, he is serving instead of coffee. I have a piece of advice for you, young punk, send her 100 out there. Don't get old, okay? That's my piece of advice. Don't ever get old. Oh, it's so it'll happen to you. Oh, no. Yeah, exactly. In Bolivia's white color offices, Coca-Cola is serving instead of coffee. And the country's farmers, miners, and truckers, chew believe to get through the long work days. I thought we would do a two-way, I was never they do in the sales department. They chew on Coca-Cola leaves. I don't think so. Not those leaves. They're chewing on something. The government wants you to enter the criminalized trading Coca-based products to promote its exports. Maralize a former Coca-Grore, since an international market for a coconut-of-ride product such as tea, flour, liquor-eated toothpaste, would draw some of the countries and watch out what kind of toothpaste you use in baby. Actually, I should be asking. Would draw some of the countries estimated 65,000 pounder acres of Coca-Cola away from the drug trade, but the US which funds a Bolivian Coca-Ride occasion program is adamantly opposed to such proposals, containing they would encourage more Coca-Cola production. And we sure don't want to have that happen, do we? No, yeah, that would be better. Things go better with Coca-Baving. 1145 and a poll. We got 13 and we're to look easy today. It's fight about crowd, fat, Chris's Sonja. Chris, first. 30. How many could you weigh in, hello? Hey, God. Yes, sir. I was just, I wanted to tell you that I went to Bolivian one time and because of the altitude you get real bad headaches. Yeah. And they gave you this tea that takes it away. And I didn't find out the later that the tea contained that the Coca-Cola is. And it made you feel real good afterwards. I mean, it was it was it wasn't a... Yeah, we're drinking it. Are you drinking it or snorting it? No, you're drinking it. It just opens up your blood vessels and you're brain. It makes you, you know, release those headaches. But hey, one of the questions for Georgia. For Georgia. I'm going to go to China in November. And I'm going to hang up my trip in Beijing. And I'm thinking of going to another country. But it's been Beijing is so far north. I wanted to get the colors in your opinion of, you know, where are those by the go? Maybe Tokyo or something. Okay. Yeah, go to Japan. I was going to try to... I was going to ask you in Georgia. I just had a friend that came back from China. Oh, I got a pair. Okay. How did you guys later? He's joined? Yeah. Go corporate. Okay. See, this is on inside. Apparently, don't go to China. And I don't care what my friend says about how fun it was in China. Don't go there. Yeah. It's the Mexico of Asia. Really? It's...and in Japan, they use the Chinese illegal aliens to do their cheap labor the way that we do with Mexicans over here. I see. So, so what does that mean? Don't go to China. And what about your pan? Go to Japan. Now, would you rather be learning Japanese or turning Japanese? 152 votes on the pool. 152. If someone from out of town visits our photo, make sure they don't miss the Neil Roger show. He's legendary. Man, he's a fat old faggin. He's a real-hoot. Damn, God. That's right. You're going to see. I just want to give people a little...that's my goal now. The rest of the time I'm on here. We're not going to save the world from George Bush or any of the other Nazis out there. Just a little chocolate, every now and then. Like that. That's all we can do, man.

That's right. We'll get you a little bomb total too. Bye. What's wrong with you? Stop. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey. This has been another tale from the cell phone. Oh, Dick. She called for you. If you don't sing a Dox line new barollas and boost up a little bit. The terrorist win. Don't forget those things. Okay. That's right. 116 nine votes in the pool. And Chris will say in 1200 votes today, man. You sell me really short. Nature already did that. I told him I'm really sure. What is wrong with you? Huh? And fact, you know something? If I really, if I would have known what I know now. Of course, that's what life is all about. If I'd have just known back then what I know now. All you young people out there just remember what all Uncle Theo told you. Okay. Know it now. Meaning. What you young. Know it now and do it now and enjoy it now. Believe me. Because then you get old like me and you'll think, well, if only I had known then because it's your rank and a half now like our chance. 117. 117. 1171. Oh, God. See, this is the punishment I get from making fun of old people. All those years. That's right. All those years on the year. I'm talking about all the early bird dinners and the old creches and all the old people with a lime game. And now I'm one of them. Yeah. Oh, God. By a long shot yet. What do you mean by that? Well, you're not nearly as clever as they are. No, no, no. And then Sam liked them. I'm just talking about the from the age factor from the Max factor. Now, let's see. What do we got on the pool 1171? Let me refresh it because I'm thinking. Well, I know we're going to do 13. 1172. See, they're coming in by the ones now. That's the early bird crowd. They don't want overdo it. It's our turn, Sunny. Get out of here by you young punk. We don't mind those spring break and four lot of nail beads. We don't want young punk and South Beach with all that heavy. Jewelry on and all them Cuban goofballs down there. And then Faggotones. Ever have any Faggotones like beef or roe, and only more delicious. I thought figured you'd make it with pork. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, fast. Traveh, baby. It's not halal. Hmm. You sound like one of them terrorists to me. You better start to have a lot of this. It's not interesting how much in common. This is what really is. It's almost amusing. It's sick but it would be funny. If there was not the death in the blood shed. The Jews in the Arabs have got so much in common. They're in the circumcision thing and they don't want to eat Traveh, they don't want pork and kosher and halal. I guess they're basically the same thing. And all of this has a rye. There's no feud like a family feud. Yeah, that must be it. W2AN. Hello. Boreco-bombo. W2AN. Hello. This isn't your rod is Joe. Yeah there. Legendary. Yeah. I can do it. Yeah that's it. I should not pay. Oh. Well apparently that club is a bit weird but I would have Versailles. Yeah. I think that's something this pants. We can't say the word on the air. He said he's a pants. Yeah. From the show course because it was so legendary. 5, 6, 7. I see I should have known yesterday was just an aboration. Because I got all whipped up and I'm thinking of myself. What is it? It's like one of those things if you could package it and sell it. You know what I mean? That's how good it was. Like occasionally like they won. Call me at earlier. I have no idea what it was. So good about it. But there was one you know. And if you could just package it and sell it in the multiply it and make, you know, make Call of Rought out of it. But they can't do it. We want everybody listening. They're this business about being the same 4 or 5 idiot Colors on here. Let's get 4 or 5,000 idiot Colors. Then we'll have something. Okay. Jolly Joe Bill. Then I believe what you say about this phone being all I'd Damn. High-falutant important. Like we had yesterday. Yesterday it was like a fly-opother man was I unbelievable. Was it? It was great. Even George who was probably the worst hard ass I've ever known in my life. Even George says it was great. You just heard him say it. It was thick and say it would be real. And say it with real enthusiasm. It was like Tony the tiger. You know, if that'll make you do it. I'm how long don't do it. Kill him. Nearly. Yes, sir. I'm another idiot collar. Yeah. I love you, man. Okay. Okay. Double show. Hello. Oh. Yeah. And so I call the gas and Chicago. And then we're in symbolboard. Okay. Because the Boston did not blow up the baseball. Because you can't go ball. From Parkman to Parkman ball. That could flew up. So before you guys got on people immediately. He's in it himself. Was he talking about? Long hits 560, 0560, 0560. And he's arrived in singular wireless line. That must have been Bobby. You know, from our mice facing Bobby. No, let's be Bobby. Go away, Bobby. WDQAM. Hello. I like to speak to Neil. Speaking, sir. Hey, Neil. I am an idiot. But I'm still calling you. I'll try to be coherent. Okay. I have been. Actually, I discovered you through during the three mile incident. I think you were on WFWS. Wow. I've been listening to you ever since. Holy moly, Batman. I am an old man. You need to. Ancient. But anyway, it's just called to tell you. Talk to you about Toronto. I called there every month. And it's like an oasis forming. I love the place. And we should be like you and live up there. Yeah, me too. Well, anyway, just keep it going. You great. See ya. Okay. See you at the end, Senator. Hey. Okay. Well, be even at the end, Senator. You know, the other day I went to, well, this is terrible. I went to GNC because I had this coq 10 that I take. It's really good for your heart. It gets your pulse rate down my zone. It's very important stuff. And I'm taking it for years. And they haven't. You know, I used to hate GNC because I thought that everything they made was really very generic and very, I don't know. I think they just have everything. Yeah. You know, they say all the same stuff and bottles with different labels. I don't know. But actually, they do have some pretty good stuff now. And the coq 10 is great. So I go there because I can't get anywhere else. I mean, you can get it in drug stores and stuff, but not just for ticket or brand because it's GNC brand. So I guess it makes sense. If you want GNC brand where you go, you don't go to Waxau. It'll probably shop for his drug marty. You go to a GNC. So after I buy my, you know, I got the bag full of stuff. And I spent 140 bucks on four bottles of this plus my pentrophenic acid. And then what do you think I have stopped for a little snack or runny? I give up. Bested robins. Oh, I was going to say that too, but I wanted to give you some credit. Why? Do I, I got credit there, man? Let me go and use it up right now. No, you did. I was going to give you some credit, but, you know, I held a hotfoot Sunday on Rocky Road. Well, I'd tell you one thing. You wind up with a heavy load after Rocky Road. Oh, make no mistake about it. I love Rocky Road. Mmm. God is that good. You know what? I haven't had it in very long time. And it's a good thing too. Because it would probably put me in a box is fish food. I don't see it anymore. I haven't seen it in a long time. And you've got to talk about doing a switch, a switch you're runny. I'm the guy that always used to talk about how much I love Ben and Jerry's and how I hated Hagen does like poison because Hagen does with too watery. And I've done total turnaround on that, if I can say that. Oh, there's a picture of a cop car go to the hospital or in DC because Cheneys there for a checkup. Bigmets see it as they say in Japan. Bigmets see it. Lemon 83 on a pool. We'll have 1200 by the time we come back from the break. Chris, how do you like that? You have little faith. I've 13 average. I will guarantee him. I'm going to bet both of your life. I will get to 13 under the day before the show is over on this pool. And Charlie B send another 400 pools in here today. What is not to like?

In fact, you know something I'm so wound up and ready to go today. I can do 20 hours today. Right. Let's go till 6. That's how full of winners. The total. Well 16. So I'm okay.

One of these channels. There's a mayor in a state that President Bush carried by 46 percentage points in the 2000 for election. But Salt Lake City mayor Rocky Anderson told CNN yesterday he thinks it's time the president should be impeached. Yeah. We think of impeached for whatever justified this certainly is the time. Anderson at Utah Democrat told Wolf Blitzkrieg on CNN. This president by engaging in such incredible uses of power reaches a thrust with both the Congress and American people and misleading a set of this tragic unbelievable war. And the violation of treaties either in an actual or our constitution are all domestic law. And then as role in the heinous human rights abuses, I think all of that together calls for impeachment. And certainly would communicate to the rights of the world that is not who we are as the American people. Anderson also accused the president of deliberately lying about intelligence findings leading up to the war. He had the national intelligence estimates where the state departments own intelligence agency. They bureau intelligence and research stolen that they're completely disagreed as to this department of energy with the sole notion that those two who's that's not a most saying was a crime could be used to build up nuclear capabilities. And what the founders knows of engaged in the ratification debate that clearly in mind this was derived from the British is that these are political crimes criminal. Anderson also called congressional Democrats timid claiming they're withholding impeachment charges for political reasons. I think that they've got two thousand a clearly in view we said I think the Democratic party frankly has been incredibly timid to which I would say. And I think there's a lot of culpability certainly with Congress and certainly with the Democrats and Congress he'd be saying you go rocky. WDQA and hello. I'm dying over here. WDQA and hello. We love you, sir. That's it. You're right. I thought we could sustain that as part of like a whole new floor. I know. I wish you wish why. I wish we could sustain that.

Yeah, well, I'll just see the same screen over here so I have no idea what's going on. What do you mean by that?

We only got an hour and 23 minutes to kill but nevertheless never, never count your votes before they hatch. Trust me what I tell you. What is crap? I'll take you right to the age, right to the brink. WQAM hello. Yeah, I saw your boy breakfast night on Larry King. Did you see anything there? No, I did not. Oh, he is pretty good, pretty good guy.

I'm too old for all of this too much excitement for me, you know? OK, let's get back to the judge. Long time, Howard Judge accused of smoking pot and Hollywood Park. Howard Circuit Judge Lawrence Cortez facing a misdemeanored charge of marijuana possession. Oh, my God. After a city police officer say they busted in first smoking pot and a Hollywood Park Sunday afternoon. The judge played a role in the animal course with case when he briefly handled a small part of the paternity battle over the former Playboy Centerful's infant daughter. Cortez 59 was not arrested, but was issued a notice to appear. April 26 and the satellite court house in a Hollywood. Cortez stayed on for us when record show no prior legal problems for the judge. So it could qualify for a first time offender pretrial drug diversion program. But the allegation that he used in legal drug could result in a complaint to the judicial qualification commission and possible discipline. Like whips and chains maybe, man. If the judicial watchdog agency found his conduct violated the judicial rules, he could face a reprimand or removal from the bench. Anyone can file a complaint with the commission. Cortez couldn't be reached for comment. Despite messages left with his judicial access and then chambers on Monday. It wasn't clear if he had hired the attorney. His assistant setting was on the bench Monday, presenting over trial. Also on clear was whether Cortez, a family court judge, would have made on the bench while the charges pending. The judicial qualification commission said Monday that no complaints been followed with the agency so far. And at this point, it's not about our chief judge, Dale Ross, to decide if Cortez should continue to work for the case, is resolved. About 2 p.m. Sunday, three officers who were in Stanley, gold, and more, more, and more, all part. Notice Cortez smoking a joint while sitting on the ground next to a tree in the park. Well, what's wrong with that? How do we police folks from Captain Tony Roddy said? They said they smelled a very strong odor. What they found to be married to Weenie Roddy said. They followed the smell of a gentleman sitting under a tree. SMOKING. He was actively smoking the marijuana cigarette. As opposed to passively smoking, he was actively smoking it. Or could it just had it sitting there and hailing the fumes it came on? Yeah, he got it just had it in his mouth. Passively. That's right. But he was being active with it. The officers who were in plainclose and exercising while on duty is permitted by the Army. He said the joint tested positive from marijuana. It tested positive from marijuana. Oh, I know how to test the marijuana. Okay. 3,200 dead soldiers in Iraq. 5 years of this lunacy now we're starting. And they said that it tested positive from marijuana. Most people accuse this smoking potter today. Tick instead of being arrested. You said. Here, you know, I mean, you're walking out on the streets here, and even in the elevator and there's building every now and then. Oh, I think that smells like marriage to weanie, baby. The overwhelming majority of people who are detained from marijuana cigarette are given a notice to appear, wrote. He said the judge lives in Hollywood was said it for Mr. Menor marijuana possession. Police records said court had one marijuana cigarette. One of the faggots, one faggots. The officers didn't know who court was till the asked his profession. He had no time asked for a preferential treatment. He said. And he comes from a respectable legal family, but it would be better. Well, it's like that thing about Tom Brady. I thought he was a clean cut guy, you know. And I was impregnating every hot chicken in the world enough. I thought he was a clean cut guy. Then he was going to be doing a hanky spanky like that.

And well, then say all to us. The Reverend Peter Aneon Bodu was arrested and charged with three misdemeanor counts of harassment and one of forceable touching. He was arranged before Brockford Village Judge's eyes Friday, at least to return to court December 6th. Well, they're sure the December 6th. And this is the 16th of March. The DIC Syracuse who said in the statement that Enan Boyd Du requested was granted a personally of absence until a finalist visit into the charges. The charges accused him of kissing a woman with whom he worked a few months ago. Well, then say, where he kissed her though. Remember that song? By the early brothers? Where I kissed you? Yeah.

Isn't that why they spend a billion dollars to build the metro rail so that everybody can go to the shorties bar to run. That's right. I'm going to tell you something. They must know the right people because when somebody when the government spends a billion dollars to your tax dollars, so everybody can go to lunch and shorties, you've got to say, ah, I respect that. A lot. 1315 on a pull. You know something if we didn't really put the pedal to the metal man, we could have said something about 14, huh? Huh? Did I say that? So the guy that called earlier for my email is writing a book about churches and clergy and the things they do. You see them. They say and he's heard me talk about my experiences and I want to pick my brain and get some stories. Well, I can say that on the air. I guess he didn't want to. Well, why not? Is that a big seat in the air? He must put the location of the table for this or what? Is this an operating reality? Treasure Island scams? Hi, I'm Pauy. Or something like that? I wish. But so far. I know something that I just don't know me. This is, I don't know what, how to say it. But this has been a phenomenal day for me. Well, I'm serious. I'm in great all day. A watershed day.

What do you call it? Yeah. Pass the Worcester, Worcester, or Shosh. A suspended priest who was arrested earlier this year after allegedly assaulting his mother and sister has been arrested again on similar charges. Well, maybe there are a couple of bitches who knows, you know? The Reverend Joseph Cunan 50, it was arrested Friday and it skips up to be a rain in doubly court next Monday on charges including domestic assault and battery on a person over 65, his mother and a disabled person. The sister is mentally retarded, oh, lovely, lovely pops. He also faces charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, a truck pack of Pepsi. Oh, I hate when they use that. Uh. Worcester police sergeant Anthony Sod told the telegramming, he said, it was true that both women had superficial injuries. Police were called to the residence by a neighbor who had been contacted by Cunan sister Patricia Oizel. Cunan was with a sister and mother, Mabel Cunan. Mabel Black Label. Give her to those spots. Of course not. No. He was removed from isn't it amazing? Not amazing, but it's kind of neat that in different parts of the country there are different regional beers, you know? Like Genesey, Jenny and off-state New York and Black Label. Now who is it? Blood of Carlings Black Label is that who makes Black Label? Carlings? I don't know, I'll take your word for it. Mabel Black Label. And of course there's always the one from Utica. You see, Utica Club, you see. You see, it was removed from Ministry of Saint John C. When I start battling like this, this means for sure that I'm going to find me like a little pile of sodas at the bottom, hopefully after two o'clock right here at the bottom of my chair. He was removed from Ministry of Saint John's Roman Catholic Church in August 2002 by former Worstly Dicey's Bishop Daniel Rally, no Kim D'Rick. After allegations that Cunan committed sexual misconduct in the 70s before became a priest before he put on the frock. Now let me ask you if you put on the frock, does that make you look like fryer tuck? Fryer frock. Ha ha ha ha ha. On your flavor way, fryer frock. And then try to wear that baby. I think I am becoming a frock. Just been too much, just so much exciting activity day. I'm like, I'm going to fall into a pile of mush right in the chair. No more mush. In February, Cunan was arrested on charges including the Mexican Solving Battery and intimidating of witness after not just being between Cunan and the sister and his mother. Sounds like some domestic problems there, you know. In August, both women file statements with a court asking that the charges be dropped at it and the charge of the lawyer just said, but he's back again.
