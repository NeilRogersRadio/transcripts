By the, you well stood this was his birthday b Absa come down Live 5 or 6 of income the for r a But be I need you to shift your game. Now the order of hey Barney and both eminence is great. I've delivered this pronouncement upon the blessed day. Ah sure a little bit half-ravin' foul and nestled in the sea. Oh, but she gone straight to help her home as a shoe-out. Love you. Oh come, l'm see I wish as long as men are men. It's a constant of a car. We've never been short of the bad, be steams and grunk and hurling, terms the love in all the way. But you can't be a you shift your game. Go to pants, be a you shift your game. Go on, jeep and try a you game. You shift your game. Get it, get it, get it. Game of ec is they see me trying to say. No, too, how about you pardon? What are you trying to say with them? I don't know. What are they trying to say? You can't be any same paddies they've created for you. Some screaming, flaming fact. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Just as Timmy hardaway, he'll tell you, Timmy, good old Timmy. I hate gay people. He wore a jox graph old Timmy, you know. This is the jox graph station, baby. I was trying to print out a thing that very jackass wrote this morning about how QA was been very intensive discussions to try to get the Dalton Broadcast back. And of course the ticket is still trying to hang on their squeeze. Well, it's what they do. And Mr. Rotts is very mad. It says he wants to be back on the broadcast if we get the games. Oh, right. Nothing. There's nothing really. I don't think Jim is certainly right to write it over the column for the Sun Sentinel anymore. If you Google Jim is certainly on the Sun Cell website, this is what? Who? Yeah. And then you tell him, well, I want to find out what he wrote and he'll say. What? He'll pop in anybody. Want to know what that old told wrote. But in any way. It's a Friday. Nothing wrong with that. March 16. We survived the eyes of March yesterday. Nothing really special happened. Nobody got nice, I guess. Nobody. Nobody. I don't stand standing in the back. Probably somebody did somewhere. But a lot of that stuff going on. It's going to go on on. You hear the drilling? Yeah, I do hear that. I was just going to ask you what's all that racket. By, I don't know what they're going to ask. I thought it was college. Oops. We got tennis going on. Maybe we got a real racket at QAM, which of course that's what I got. A real racket. Anyway, here's the pull from yesterday. Why? I'll tell you. Charlie B. Oh, first I got to tell Chris. There had me 30th birthday, Chris. Somebody on the, uh, my space wanted me to wish. It's not the Chris you know or I know, but it's. And also they want me to say, hey Chris, you're fair. Like that. See how I applied. We have probably over the 68 friends in my space. I have a little advice by the way about my space a little bit. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Well, it all depends on what you're doing on there. If you're just doing around that's fine. If you're looking to like meet somebody to make a friend or an acquaintance or like get later, something like that. If the other person on there is evasive and doesn't want to give you very much information or even the town that they live in or much less like a last name or a phone number, or something like that. I would just take it with a green assault and probably like delete them immediately. And if they don't want to, that's just my suggestion. You know what I'm saying? What do you say? Because they're just a too many eight. It's an anonymous thing. It's anonymous. Makes people are forthcoming. They want to give you like a real name and this and that. That's anyway Charlie B. He was very apologetic. Yeah. This is a good poll somebody said. And this is great. But what do you apologize in Charlie? So some of your polls suck. That's okay. A lot of our polls suck too. We're getting paid to do this stuff. So this goes the one yesterday was week. I mean, we did want to end up with the whole bunch of votes. How many? Like let's see. 1400. All right. Today's polls are terrible too. According to the audience, I think today's polls fine. And yet I hate this poll. As when the hands down your pants is not even close away out in front of all the rest. I hate this poll. Because South Florida is just full of hate. And you know what? I understand. If you're trapped in a outdoor accepted thing and outdoor is cesspool like South Florida. Actually, you're probably going to be a little more hostile than the run of the middle Schmuck run and run on loose. This is a good poll somebody said. And this one might be good for a froth for a what what day is it for over the weekend Saturday. Well, well, what's the only thing that this other one is going to stay up all the way over the weekend? See, I've got to hit myself on these now. I realize the one that's on there right now is the Friday poll that stays up through the weekend. I might change this on. I don't know. Sooner. Sooner after than later. When Neil show ends early because of Marlon's baseball eye, listen to every second of the baseball broadcast. Smash my radio with a hammer, sit in a dark room and pout. Take a nap because it means they've zusted after Neil show anyway. Take my vest and Neil CDs. Switch to the sports hole stage across the street. Work on my fantasy league roster. Pray that the Marlon's bias low painful death. Listen to Rushless, and imagine if it was in the power. Turn off my radio until it's time for Neil's next show or read the Bible. There you go. Pray for us to come back when Ed Marlon game comes on, man. Oh, you know what I haven't gotten any assistant son because I'm trying to get some Chicago tourist information here for a friend of mine. And who's making this first trip? I haven't been there in about 400 years. I love Chicago. It's a great city. But the pizza, I asked this the other day and the pizza thing. I'm not getting any, I mean, you can go online and I've done that. And you can read all those reviews. You know, here from like a living and breathing person. Maybe a facts would be good. Okay. It will get some calls. I, you know, I don't know. Because the list that I've got, Lumel not ease, which has been there for like five generations, I guess. Jordanos, which is, Jordanos is great, but I'm told that the lines are like around a block all the time. I get an entrant. Geno's east. Pizza, we know, oh, which everybody rates real high, but I'm told that pizza will be a do way, which is the same moment and rock cross speed is much better. And Chicago pizza and oven grater. Remember we had to call about that the other day. I guess it's like pizza in a bowl. Pizza in a bowl. Hmm. So that's the list I've got so far. Maybe we'll get some advice on it from some people who maybe from Chicago or whatever. You know, well, you, all the most of the Midwest people around the West Coast are Florida. We've obviously got a few out there, but nevertheless. Oh, today is the right day. Today is Friday. Right. I want to double check before I read this. Today is Friday. BSO deputies will conduct the U.S. and patrols tonight. A 30 p.m. until 5.30 in our morning in areas of dear field beach, Pompano Beach. It opened part. Rock solid. No, I was going to go out there. In Pair drivers will be identified in D.Y. laws will be actively enforced. That's tonight from 8.30. It'll 5.30 in our morning. If you're going to be driving around plaster, drunk off your ass or just have a big fat with an anastrate. Not a good idea to be doing that in dear field beach, Pompano Beach or open park tonight. It'll 5.30 in more. 5.30 morning, come out and just have a wild blast. Here's the pull results from yesterday. Come to the Q&A and hello. Hello. Good morning. I'm pressure. I'm down here for eight years. Rosadesis is a real good. Incrup. Rosadesis. Rosadesis is good at the franchise with the income. And then you'll win your reach a call. I'll come to see if I can set their field now. Home run in beach is very good too. What is it? Home run in beach. Home run in. Yeah. Okay. I'll run right in. Thanks a lot. There you go. That's why I punched that up. Who was like, uh huh? You knew that. All of a sudden. We weren't at a comiskey park. We were at really feel. But nevertheless, since once on the south side. But nevertheless, home run in and Rosadesis. Sounds real small. It sounds good. Too bad I can't eat no pizza. You know. I can't. I can't. Probably the pizza thief would come in and steal it. I'm going to leave. Here's the pull from yesterday. I don't know. It's apologizing for her. Of course, he's got plenty to afford. Yeah, listen. Whatever. But it works as fever. It's like a half a dozen polls almost every day. Don't be apologizing for nothing Charlie. That's right. What I mean? We don't look a poll horse in the mouth. That's for sure. And, interestingly, I don't know. And we got a bunch of blanks to fill in. I know the answers to all of these. 970, 69.2% great Americans who know their crap. We think they do. I hate this poll. 153 10.9%. And, interestingly, I don't know the words to the stars. The stars fangled ban are 102. How is they? Can you see? He still don't have Jose Felicia. No, no, no. Well, why not? Not out there. What do you mean not that one? What do you mean? You can find that one. You have like my friends and have your dad and like my fire. Felicia, have your dad and your dad? Yeah. Well, I hope they let him go after cool the mom a little. But you got like my fire? I got like my fire. I'm not talking about by the door. Was anybody in play the door? So, there we go. There we go. So good. Jose Felicia. You're happy. And this is still alive. I think we're hands together folks in prayer. He's got a beautiful wife. Does he really? Have you seen her? No, he hasn't even. I know that's exactly what we're going to do. You are so bad. It's such a tasteless little spig man. I think I don't think there's any doubt you're going to burn in hell. They're going to roast you and tow the wood so whatever. And have you for lunch? You know that it would be untrue. It would be untrue. You know that I would be so pretty. So pretty. So pretty. I know that was the door. It was a wire. It was a wire. It was a wire. Okay, that's enough. Emberishing that I don't think it's necessarily 74. Those people ought to be deported immediately. Probably some of your folks, you know. They've been animal crowd. Are you kidding me? Hey, let's play banana boat. Listen, I am American dark. I know. I don't want to hear it. Just to pick it. I was just in joke. It was ever used stopping. So defensive Jesus Christ. With all your bigoted swill. Well, and interestingly, I don't know where Iraq is at. I'm at 37. And I'll see if most of these people would be honest. They couldn't find Iraqi. You could stuck an oozy way inside. That's right. Iraq, my ass. That's what they would say. And probably that might be there too. The way things are going over there. Their ass is probably a better shape than Iraq. I'm versing it on with the answers to any of these 16. Four nations capitalist named for 13. I'm sure it's H.B. Keltonborn. Who was present before W.9? That's the pleasantly just nine. How many states there are in you? You can't see it. Six. What size fought in the Civil War for? What are your American Accuracy Independence for? How many stars are on the flag? Three. Fourteen embevolts on yesterday's Incipit idiotic QAM poll. That's one Friday you bested. That's absolutely. That's absolutely. I really miss my time. I better start that over again. Okay. I got this liner to read. During the QM Street team, the name for movie 2 with the Verizon Wireless Store. A hundred-suffice can blow of art in downtown Miami. Stuff like it when prizes can get all the grants from the heat dancers. They'll sign a party in a autograph too. They'll write right on. Just extend the hand of the hand of princess. They'll flag the hand of friendship and they'll sign. They'll say, where do I decide anything on it? And they'll write it over here. We've got a camera so you can watch them on your TV. She's not a girl but you're not a woman so can't get them through and breathe. Oh. You'll think she's not that smart. You're not a bad spot. You're not even stay up all down. She will always be her dress. She'll even need the dress. I'm so grateful around. She just came on to stand. I'm just staying up on small handy hair. Maybe the kids show on TV. They're alive. They're alive. They're never getting hurt. You keep going mind. You keep on spreading. They're coming. They're coming. They're coming. They're coming. They're coming. What a nauseating thought that is. Since 17 and 5, 60 WDQM has fact they're either rather now becoming a nauseating thought. Maybe she's trying to catch up with him. Yes. Once upon a time she was considered so desirable and so luxurious and delicious and now fair. They're lying. Anyway, and you know this thing that I'm asking it seems like a fairly simple question. I'm sure we've got a lot of Chicago people out there and people have spent a lot of time in the city. But I'm not just looking to have a list of names of places you can do better than the yellow pages. Just open up to the pizza and the yellow pages. I'm trying to find out which other really, maybe three or four really absolute best by test. Because I think, I said yes, it's the last time I was there was a that club's thing that we did, you know. You say there for about 10 minutes and they say you're asked back. Right. Well, they were pretty much actually having a good time. They were not good at that. No. 716 most times of the days pool. I guess we got a thousand made. I was a little worried about it because they despise this pool today. They hated poison. I don't know why I'm saying there's anything wrong with it. Maybe it just doesn't have enough stomach spursions on it. I think it's fine. Just fine. The dumbest expression that people say is, and I hate this pool is winning 164. Twenty-three percent of the audience hates this pool today. Well, I've talked about it. One thing we go to for to get the early bird. We get the surly bird on this show. WDQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. Star-Syron, Chicago. Magic Dick on the lick and stick. Okay. Moving along. Sound another 16 votes. The VMS expression. I hate this pool. Twenty-three percent. One sixty-four. Two shakes of the lamb's tail. One-on-one. A pig in a poke. 79. I voted for two shakes of the lamb's tail. So did you again. I hate that. I say it all the time. That's why I hated like this. A pig in a poke. 79. Yeah. Poked this. How about pork salad? Any. I hate that. Reminds me of that. Pofokes. You know? It's that whole illiterate kind of southern deep south. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure if it's a mentality. I'll come back now. Like that. I hate that. Never stole a freight train, sixty-four. Look at these splits, sixty-one. In a Cooenzege, fifty-eight. Now does that have kind of like racist over-tolder or something or what? I don't know. A feather in your cat, twenty-five. Well, no, I mean, what does that mean in a Cooenzege? How will the rat Cooenze live through? I don't know about this one. I don't know about this one. I think they don't have a dumb expression forty. Right. Why is that even on there? That is a door nail forty. Dumb as dirt, twenty, as the crow flies sixteen. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. The crow he flew right out the door, the crow. Five, six, seven. Oh, eight, five, six. Oh, God. Uh, right in my whistle, fourteen. Or everybody wants to wet their whistle. A whistle. A whistle. And a hopsciffin' a jump has got twelve. About a seven and twenty-three. Chris, I think you can rest easy. I think we will make the thousand, although not, you know, that can be another one of those record breaking days like Monday. QAM Hello. Two AAM. Yes, sir. Wonderful proof. Oh, God. W. Q. W. M. Hello. Q. A. M. A. Yeah. How are you doing? I'm doing. I got one for your poll. How about Dick Bush and Cheney for President. Oh, four. That's pretty dumb expression. Wow. Do you ever just want to like put your head in your hands and cry? Yeah. I was just blowing my nose around her. No, good. That's probably much, much more entertaining. So, honestly, how is that? I mean, did they let you out on Friday's only? Or what is it? They've sneaked and teleported into one of the doors. Yeah. They had a phone call. They had phones and the who's going on. Yeah. W. Q. A. M. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. For the poll. Good to go. Good to go, yeah. How about hot day? Oh, yeah. I hate go. Okay. Good.

How about back in the day? Okay. A lot of them both on there. I put them both on there because I think they're both like kind of contemporaneous if you ask me whatever the hell that means. Back in the day. We're good to go. Yeah. Back in the day, everybody was good to go. Not no mole. W. Q. A. M. Hello. Good. Good morning, you know. Yes, sir. What is the answer? What is the answer? One for your poll. If you want to put on or really care about it. Or how about the expression that you were in my shoes? If you were in my shoes, yeah. Yeah. Like, do you and my shoes would be pretty damn busy in here. I'll tell you that. Because it's hell. Hey, have a good one. It's rainy tail here in Florida. It's not raining. It's murky and, you know, it's going to snow later this afternoon again. I guess this is going to be the last advice. Because I know this is predicting for next week. One day 63 and another day 65 to which I say, All right. What's wrong with that? Because most of the temperature warm up in the machines of woodbind warm up to anybody buying that. Anybody believe it? No, including me. No chance. W. Q. A. M. Hello. Just that. For the last. For the last. Yes? No. W. Q. A. M. Hello. How about why do you continue to hate? What is this? Reverend Jones. Oh, isn't it? Fine. Now listen. Give me a little bit of credit. W. Q. A. M. Hello. Hey, no. I don't want for you, Paul. Yeah. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? Yeah. I do. I say that all the time. You know what I mean? We all say that it's time it stopped. Yeah. Let's stop saying that right now. Stop saying you know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Huh? You know what I mean? Huh? Yeah. That's all the stupid expression, huh? He said 1309 votes on the pool. Leopard con speed trapped nest Florida drivers. There's some goodness stuff. Some people send in this morning already. Which is good. I don't want to read a bunch of boring news stories about how the world is coming to wind and chicken little is running around going bananas. W. Q. A. M. Hello. Yes? I got one for you. Yeah. Let's make it snappy. Get out of here. Make it snappy snappy. That's pretty dumb. Who the hell? Anybody say that? Put it on the sample. Put it on the mall on there. Let's put five. Then at least it'll bring the percentage of I hit this pull down under 20%. Me right now it's 22.7% which is really bad. That makes you feel really bad on this unclean. You know, like I want to go take another shower with my body wash. In the fact that there are still people using soap in the shower that is so aggravating to me. It just makes me want to just squat and do any normal number run in the carpet here. That would be too happy. But I just want to do stuff like that. What is wrong with people? You know? When there's so much, it's not like it's expensive to buy body wash. You know, you can buy a bottle of body wash for a couple of bucks. But it's not like real expensive. You know plus, you know. I mean, why am I defending? Why do I have to give these people instructions on life? How to get out of bed in the morning? Yeah, yeah, inhale. You know, exhale. Yeah. Go to the bathroom. Hopefully.

And believe me, he is. If what you got is good, he's willing. Believe me. As I've all been to do days, get stupid expressions for the poll. Yeah. I mean, after I care, that's fine with me. We can do it all the way up to two o'clock. Is this poll is going to be on our all weekend long? Over now, it's 22.6% hate the poll. A festival of hate. That's life in South Florida. And over 31 years plus plus 15 days now. At every day, I can smell it, man. You can smell the hate in the air. And I just ask myself, what are you? Is it all about why? Why? Why is there so much? Why are these people so filled with nausea and disgust and just hate with and content for anything and everybody else? Anything that's breathing, anything that's even the blades of grass. They like a lot of other way to step on. Not just step on the grasses they're walking, but like crunch it in with a shoe. You know, like you're putting out a cigarette? Yeah. And how people do that? Squash it and squash it and like dig it into the grass. Just, ah, get it, get it! That's what they want. Of course, who don't want to get it? WCW and hello. Deal. Yes, sir. At the end of the day. That's the end of the day. Oh, I hate that one. At the end of the day. Oh, I tune in. Oh, what? Yeah. Just thought of one. That I go ahead and stand on. You know what it means in your heart of the hearts. Oh, they really might bother walkers. Let's get just like these people. Let's start hating. I hate that. Like, what does that even mean? At the end of the day. Yeah. There's some radio person who, like, oh, you know who it is? Bill Tanner used to say, really? He would shoot all the shit with the bang. And I'd still get what? And he'd just say at the end of the day. I don't know. I guess that's when he was trying to explain to me, at least the checks clear in his place. Even though this is back in the beginning. You know, I thought of like back in the days full of crap. Back in the day. And they were not good to go, you know? Seven, fifty on the pole. Well, Greg, we was never good to go. That's what I, that's what's screw-and-full me. 750 votes on the pole is an amazing. The tremendous turnover we've had. Since we had a regime change, you got no more screw-and, no more water not see, no more moe, how are you going to stay still around? She's going to work for power now. Who is screw-and? She made it come back in. I'm just saying all of all of Greg's buddies. She's overpower because he's over there now. That's right. She's over in the side of building to be close to Greg. So all of these people of Venice kind of like most of the audience too. She's not cry, but you wear still. My hands are shaking and he's a weak. I have to walk to work on my own to see. If she purchased a call, don't drop because my car. I can't feel up on her room. On, yay, yay. Oh, please don't ask me once. Oh, my mind just prasses our open calls to 29.

Get out of the restaurant and eat dancers just extend the Atlanta hand apprenticeship and they'll sign for it. So Brandon says, who's under the weather day, feel better, taking a couple of BC powders. Man is that what you do in the South when you don't feel anywhere else. He takes like an Alky Seltzer, right?

Let's cut a rug. I think he's mad at you now. You know, something. There's an old expression. I think that sums it up really well. Where there's no sense there's no feeling. You know what I mean?

And then toward the end of the game is they were counting down the last seconds of the game. The crowd was screaming and carrying on like, like it was the home team was going to win five. The three. I don't know what else going on in that joint. But nevertheless, like I said, the whole cut. Panthers hockey. That's an oxymoron. No playoffs again this year. I'm awfully sorry. And tomorrow on to the Metz in Jupiter, it's just 50 and night. Any key from Vegas after the baseball game. That's always a big ratings builder. Those modeling games, especially the ones right there in the middle of the day time. I'm looking for an honor about 11 o'clock sounds good to me. Can you imagine the pressure pack power a half hour we can do from 10.38 to 11. We got 22 minutes to go. That would be good. WQA M. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yep. Yes sir. Yes sir. Good morning. Good morning. Forget about it. Everybody in the brother. You know, another one that they say now is because of the soprano. Because they ripped off all the grandfather's stuff. Forget about it is one and. I'm being a part of it. I'm being a part of it. We're just about a being. Yeah, I'm not one. Oh, that's a good. Forget about it. Forget about it. Right. And about a being is done in expression. It's just a word. Right. And it's about the name of a strip club. Yeah. I don't really care. I'm not really interested in the soprano. I know everybody says, Oh, you've got to watch it. You're such a good father thing. But you know something. It's not a bad father. It's not supposed to be. Well, that good. I don't need to watch it because it's not. It's not much of overactive the Italian over-air emotional His cervical, you know, Italian drama queens is what it is. And I wish I could play some of those drop-ins that we used to play. But we can't play that normal. Yeah. Well, I did watch South Park last night. It must have been the wrong episode. Well, they played two of them back to back a repeat in the new one. I saw them on about the planetarium. Yeah. Yeah. I was funny. Planetarium. That was the old zone. And then she went to the next one. Dude, was that supposed to be really funny? Because it wasn't the one that was turning out. Oh, I like the fact that Cartman got the, I think he, well, he didn't actually win the thing. But he got the end of the finals doing the, to do rules or whatever that the cheesy puffs, whatever. Right. It's the one where I got this on. I got that one. Yeah. Oh, they're all the lines of the net. Seven hundred and 79 votes on the pool. Here's what we got so far. The dumbest expression people say, I hate this pool. It's still got 22% of coming down. 172. Two shades of lamb sale 119. Picking a poke 83. I poke this. Never stole a freight train 71. Look at these split 63. Which of course, a lot of you guys are thinking, Oh, we know what that means. Ha ha ha. Yeah, right. Never do it. No comment. In a clown's age 63. A feather in your cat, 46 never heard a dumbest version 42 idiots. That is a Dorneo 41. Them is dirt 21. As the crow flies 16. Wet my whistle 15. How about wet my beak like down for no cheat? Uh, what my whistle, uh, hops give them a jump 13. The heart of and your heart are hearts for. You know what I mean for. Huh? You know what I mean? Huh? Huh? What do you mean? I don't know. First time cover log time list. 3 that just drives me up the wall. I want to do like plastic, Spastic Man or Spider Man, a climb up to the wall. A back in the day three. Good to go with three. At the end of the day two. By hooker by crook. Make it snappy. And if you were in my shoes, those have got the big go so far. The 704 almost 800 votes are ready. We're on a rule. Let's see. Just about air weak ass connected with sports. Love to use expression. He or she isn't controlled their own destiny. That's not good. It says well, one could control destiny. Wouldn't be destiny. Would it? Wow. Yeah. It says maybe the dumbest sports expression. It's a subcategory or separate pool. Oh yeah. He takes it through the hole. Well, that opens up some avenues. I don't know. You best. Last night, my uncle Tony joined my wife and kids at the All of three restaurant. Now my uncle Tony, he's an Italian cuisine connoisseur. If it ain't perfect, he's not happy. Now I couldn't believe it when he said the chicken promise on was the best he'd ever tasted. Plus he kept raving about the free breadsticks and all the salad you could eat. My uncle Tony recommends you come down to the All of three because when you're here, you're family. And by that, I mean, you know, in the family. My last night, this couple was done eating. Right? And they were walking out. My uncle says, where you going? And they say, well, head and not to see a movie. And Tony says, huh, huh, huh. Not to the you head down to the four ace club and put a head on a Football Maroni. And these people freaked out. Right? They started laughing because it didn't realize my uncle was serious. And that once you eat at the All of three, you're in the family, right? So Tony stands up and he says, well, so funny. Do I am new to you? Am I some kind of clown or something? Then he takes a steak knife. Right? And he starts sticking this guy. And he's sticking him right? Well, anyway, the meal was great. The All of three restaurant when you're here, your family forever. Right. 1047, at least for a half hour, at least till, uh, I bring the meal at the table. And I got to get said then, pork out of the bottle. I still keep thinking about Salatto and that is actually a great look like. You know, you ever going to get that thing open? See, you're out of here. We can talk, you know, that's wrong with you. Somebody faces this in. I don't think you to one of these qualify. I found it in the last place I looked. I mean, that is stupid. It's a stupid thing to say because obviously, Yeah, if you found it, then wherever you found it, that was the last place. Even if it was the first place you looked, it still was the last place you looked. I found it the second to the last place I looked. Oh, well, that's good. At least it was in the very last. I hate when that happens. And then, and says, love, he's a sharp as a cue ball. See, this is, this is expressions for goyum. Because the way it's really said sharp as a matable, as the way it's said, or the way that most the Gentiles would say sharp as a marble, not sharp as a, hello. You? Huh? Great. You're cutting out. What do you mean by that? Well, you were talking and then you weren't now you're arguing. Yeah, well, how many times then happens? So just learn all my life. So, well, just relax. So can you get so damn it? I don't want to even know about it. It's like, what were you telling me yesterday about the book or about chicken egg? The station has some potatoes and why not have any potatoes since anywhere, whenever it will. Why is that? Two grand in our rears. Is he says, they're what? Like $2000 behind. Well, a guy like him can't afford to be two grand in a reen, you rears. I know. My god, when you people are going to get with it. And what the hell is this audience? You know, I have one call or one facts about the Chicago pizza, which is okay, I guess. You know, you know, the best way to do it when you go somewhere, you try yourself and you find out. Because everybody in their brother can give you all kinds of suggestions and tell you this, but a beat, but a book. Although, it would be nice to see how many of you point. You're like, if you're going to Rome, I'll tell you about my favorite try to read. And my favorite pizza read in Rome. On a pinch of a amodeo. The a pinch of amodeo. Well, what a great try to read man. I just love that place. In fact, if I wait like 130 pounds, if I was underweight not diabetic, I would just get on a plane right now and go there and just munch. I'm on jaman jaman jaman jadifood in Rome, baby. I'm not. I have, I will admit this. I did have a couple of bad meals there. You know, when somebody tells you, oh, it's such a great place for food. You can't get a bad meal there. Well, if you go in a wrong joint, you know, you can get a bad meal anywhere. In one I'm saying, what do you need to read? What was that again? You know, I'm saying. There was another poll too. Oh, and I hear you go, here's some soft Florida tourist suggestions. If somebody from a lot of town visits off for or make sure they don't miss. See what I would do is make sure they didn't do it. Right. If I wanted to be a nice guy, say, oh, don't go there. You don't want to go to South Florida. Make sure they don't miss South Beach. The Metro Zoo, the monkey jungle, a little fa van, a little rage show. Now we're talking. What else is there? The jungle queen dinner crew speaking of queens. Sovereign smells more. My guy spelled my Kia. Remember to talk about their car. I have no idea. Kia. My guy. I would advise them not to come right here this fall. That's very, very, very nice. I like his it. Oh. A lot of facts is this morning, man. Oh, here you go. And you know, something. This is the winner when I say it all the time. And hate saying it because it's a, they're got a very excellent point. Can I be honest with you? Or to be honest with you. I say that all the time. I don't know why because I am honest with them. I'm honest with you. I'm not a one of those. I mean, I'll lie when I need to. Like anybody else, but not that much. You know? What do you mean? No, I end them to like friends of mine. I don't lie. I'm trying to think of I even like tell white lies. I just don't lie. It is no fun. Right. But when somebody says, can I be honest with him? The fact is, there's no lie to me. I prefer that. Right. So if you were married, you'd lie a lot. But I'm not married. Isn't that a wonderful thing? Maybe that's why I'm still alive. Maybe why I made it to 64. Maybe make it to 94, okay? Because I'm not in a that persuasion. Or is a Pat boom would say friendly persuasion. It's a good thing. You got 810 votes on a full. They were creeped along toward the 900 mark. We'll get 2,000 by 2, not too much more than that though. Because let me see how much they hate. Yeah, it's 21.7. 1 to 22 percent hate the pull. That's a leading. And the interesting part of it is, it's quite the fact that they hate the pull so much. We're getting easy in calls with people coming up with other expressions. It's a great pull. There's an advancing wrong with it. Is there anything wrong with it? No. Here's a fact. I'm not going to bother to send. Yes. It says, how could we forget the stupidest expression frequently used by this stupidest a-holes? And then it doesn't say what that is. I see. Well, maybe they overlooked. Maybe they got so emotionally over raw. I don't know. 560560, palm 560, the Verizon singular wireless line. WQAM, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes. I have a couple of my don't like. Up your alley?

That's why when we take those stupid ass polls about one, you know, your favorite character from the Godfather. I just say all of you, well, you know. It's hard to pick one out and say, yeah, they weren't very good. I'm talking about the first two movies. Obviously in the third, we can start getting carried away. It's pretend it didn't ever happen. Pretend it at one. I still say there was some really good stuff in it. Too bad they ruined the good story with all of that acting, but the bad dialogue and the bad whatever. And remember all the talk that was going to be Godfather four, well, who the hell was still going to be alive? There was nobody left. Michael died. Remember he dropped the orange. They all had his, Marlboro say it was had the orange peel and his mouth. He was trying to scare the a grand kid there. He's trying to scare Anthony. Remember he was going to then, of course, the bug spray. Like orange is killed if you're a dog. I guess so. I guess. And that's because the orange is the citrus fruit come from Florida. They're killers. Well, you're beating us in Florida. See, there are a lot of old people in Florida. But those people came to Florida. They were like, ah, 30, about five years ago. Now they all look like 80 and 90 and a hundred minutes because they've had a rough life in Florida. The sun just wrought their skin and drives it all out and they get all wrinkled and crinkled. They start winning and lime green pants. WDQAM. Hello. Hey, you. Yes. You know, kind of bugs me is that the journalists start using these phrases like in the mix. And what I hate that in the mix. Yeah. When this one turned up bad, but the sports on the really bugs me and you know, two run jack, the yard won't hold it. And we're one that would apply to you, turn a low on you to say he overperformed his contract or outperform his contract. So you want to more money. That's another favorite expression. Yeah, the sports thing is Sammy goes yard goes yard. And to me, they just drives me insane. So we keep out performing your contract. No, they owe you more money. Okay. Thanks, proud. Yeah.

I'd rather you would actually call a hooker girlfriend being there. You would go to them to do things that you wouldn't do to go from anyway. Just a quick thing about your show. I love you show. But can you read one of those facts? Why did you just have a shredder instead of ripping the paper? I mean, I'm getting tired of the ripping of the paper.

Okay, thanks, pal. Thanks. I thought it was a good idea. I think Giorgano is based on what I think I got on the guy in Utah. And what I heard from a friend of mine, who's a Chicago, I wouldn't say expert, but no, but it was pretty well. He said Giorgano is great and that's probably why it's so busy. There's lined up like 80. You know, the one thing about the Chicago pizza and I'm trying to think of what station I worked in, where we headed, they'll send it air express. You know, they put it in those, what do they call those things? I give up. Oh, you? Huh? They call them Fred. They pack them on dry ice as well. I'm trying to, okay. And we, I think was Sarah Sodor like back in the 73 when I worked at WSPB and we got a Chicago pizza delivered in the air express like that. And then there was some other stuff that we had was it's the Chicago dogs. I don't know. There was some other food that we had ship and it's a damn good. And if you go on the websites of all these places like Ginoziste and Lumaal Naudi's and Giorgano's, most of those joints will ship them anywhere in the country. And so the fact that you're stuck like an ash to be low or higher somewhere in your thinking, oh, gee, I wish I had some of that really good Chicago style pizza or whatever. There are a lot of places like that that'll send you, you know. Just don't stick your hands in the dry ice. That's my best suggestion to you. Not a really good idea. Now put it on your tongue. That's better. That's always the best. WQAM Hello. WQAM Hello. Any other few cliches? Oh, sure. 20 or 30 will be good. Go hug. Yeah, tell us, or so. He's a real stand up guy. You know, stand up guys and post your lead down guy, right? And the same my first time at the rodeo. Never heard that one. I don't go to the rodeo much, yeah. I guess not. Smooth is a gravy sandwich. Huh? A gravy sandwich. Like that. Oh, for me. Yeah, I love that. And I picked a bad day to get up snoring crack. Okay. I'm out of material, man. Thank you. Right. I think it was just the right spot, you know. Sometimes it pushes a little bit too far. He knew exactly when to bail out. When at that time. It was something like he was replacing the airplane a bit. That we played a little bit ago. Yeah. Boyd bridges. Boyd bridges is dead. How about some of the other people in there? Peter Graves is still alive and doing those nice guy co-spots. Oh, that's one of my very least. There was another 10 tree in the plant. Some 10 tree. Looked lost and answered it or I was one lucky woman. Of course. Unless you saw airplane. I didn't know I'd be with that even mean. Right. Am I right? It is a tie and there's no question. Oh, sure. He's been freezing the same fact. Character that he was in airplane. I've never seen a grown man naked to the right. It's a matter of fact. 957 was a full work. Why is he in 10th grade growing in the middle of the road? What the wrong way is the wrong way? They haven't we all. Yeah. You have. Well, I'll be damned. 957 was saying, there was a guy who would buy the other day. I swear to you. And this is disgusting too. He looked like a famous porn star. And I say that term very loosely. Who it was after losing an enormous amount of weight. Does that mean good or bad? Bad. Okay. Roger. He could have been his twin brother. Only a much smaller swimmer. And I did not ask whether he was double-jointed or whatever. Oh, my god. And talk about getting spilties. Talk about a guy who's definitely in the wrong career. And he's not out anyway. And still made a lot of money. And as long as I live on, I remember for good that day. He was so insulted because I said he was fat and hairy and disgusting. Which I mean, look in the mirror, Ron. You're fat and hairy and disgusting. Okay. So big deal. You're double-jointed. Congratulations, you know. Wow. He was very insulted. I guess he considers himself a real stud. I consider me, dud. WQAM. Hello. Oh, hey Neil, how you doing? Okay, sorry. This is already on there. That he could gravy think brought this to mind. Riding the gravy train. What is that? You didn't figure that? Yeah, dud. Yeah, we've talked about yesterday. They've got some gravy. Delicious. I mean, you put on a sandwich. It's weird. No, no, another one we forgot because that guy's boring. In the back of the salad days. What? Right. They were talking about that yesterday. We forgot to put it on there, though. The salad days. Why? I still haven't written that. When you say the steak and potato, they're not a message. But the salad days sound lean and mean to me. You know, not to, I don't know, name something good like back in the pot roast days. Right. Back in the chef of the on days, we're certain like that. Back in the sirloin steak days, when we had a lot of money and things are really great. And we were on the gravy train or whatever. Now we're eating gravy train. And if we stick with this bunch of losers, we got here at QM much longer. We're going to all be eating gravy train. I'm talking about jelly. How's he doing, by the way? Is he coming by to say higher or whatever? Not lately. Jolly, Jersey Joe, no? No, no, you told me how much he hates me, I guess he doesn't come by either. Oh, well. He probably hates me too now because of the fact that I tell the truth and I talk about the fact that the numbers are in the toilet. Now what a phenomenal job he's done. And I think in, of course, that morning show, I would, I would be surprised if he and Clarence are both the architects of that and toast as well. The aptly named one. WDQAM, hello. George, finally came out, all right. WDQAM, hello. Yeah, I got up there for you. Yes, sir. Not for nothing. And you know what I'm saying? No, what I'm saying now, in that already on our way, is that how long time we go? Not for nothing. No, not for nothing. These, because there's only about 40,000 of them, I could read the whole poll once and we'd be done. That's an idea. It's a thought. Now what was the first one he said? Not for nothing. Not for nothing. I hear it a lot, I don't really understand what it means. It's like GFE. Growth. Well, now what did the criticism of the friend experience? Growth and experience. Growth and experience. We've been on a grade, let's go on a shade and make sure you get made. It feels like he gets ready. Well, there's Castro. It's no surgery that he had. Who would have suddenly lost his Castro? He's in perfect shape and there's a picture of his, he's got like a president. If we were to call a judge. And they were right in blue jacket as a matter of fact. So we made a con, we said, I'll ride a man to con. What made a con? I remember that scene in Talon, Mr. Ripley. Really stupid scene. Were they, if they jazzed, clubbed somewhere, nearly? Yeah, but that's the run that. So feel the rend of the. I'm at a con. I'm at a con, I beg you pardon. Naples affairs, something like that. What about it? That's where they originally say that song. Well, what's that guy to do with Talon, Mr. Ripley? I'm sure that they met Damon and Ripley and all. Some people say it. I still very unnerved by the scene where Jude lost it. And the bats have naked and Tom Ripley wants to get in. You know, Matt Damon wants to get in there. Matt Damon. Matt Damon. Matt Damon. Ha ha ha. Team America world police. I'm going to tell you if you need press. Get that this weekend and watch it over and over and over and over again. May you love it. From it is past new and QM. Friday you bested. Oh, right. I'm dying all the way out. Huh? Stop bombing back there. Absolutely. Do it every day. I want to watch it on TV. I racked. I racked. Oh. We've not moved. It should take a day. Let us just put a net to which I racked. I racked. I want to wake up and see their city is don't exist. Hope in thin air and tell that's sort of a scene. Oh, we're really pissed. You're on the ice game. That little piece of shit. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey, get me away. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I'll get the mouth of make a hit. From all of your eyes. It's a dumb ass. You go up and down. We all know it's time to bump. I racked. I racked. I racked. I racked. I racked. I racked. I racked. I want to wake up and see their city is on the floor to fit. I'm going to be back. And say that win number one. I follow the heat. We can't be beaten. I can't we have one. But for me, I racked. Why not start to change? Let's make your heart a bit. That old barbed. When all the boys are there, I'll do a show with that shit share and safe goodbye. I racked. I racked. I racked. Who is the next? Bang, bang, it did. Ouch. I'm sorry, don't I? Anybody ever were attacked by us, quarter-longed back of the head and say, Hey, there's no stories on there. There's no bedtime stories. We're just sitting on the whole bunch yesterday. He gave me a song of the answer. I didn't send him any. He's either in a house and placed it in here. He's one. He's either in a meeting or not here. Wasn't that great? Well, that's okay. Listen, that's the QM extra service. He's the busy part of the year, but it's not going to get into that check. I'm not sure what I'm talking about. It's true. I mean, why not help what I send the check. I send like, you know, 15, 20 important stories. And there's nothing on there. And our vast audience out there is like going back again. And again, where is the stuff we're supposed to read today? So it's intellectual stories for all those egg heads out here. Scott and Penelis Park says he said, by the way, Penelis Park is the only place that could make Tamrak look good. Excellent points, Scott. Few more. It's a win-win situation from the get-go. He or she is a partial stranger. Yeah, that's interesting. A partial stranger. He or she's no day at the beach. And it says the tool for you numbers are working if you're calling from the 727 area code. Well, that's what my code is. Scott, it'll teach you to live in the 727. You're going to be 727 area code. Don't do it again. But here's my very favorite. It's from Dave, who says, and this to your domestic expressions, pull. This is my favorite. We're not going to put this one on there, but this, it's nothing's even close. You want to hear it? Ready? Robert Greeper, the grim reaper, and the Lord of the Board. Nice going day.

Lord of the. Okay, I got either way. Listen, I have the opposite of this. I think the greatest expression is coming to modern usage. Yeah, I'm sure the George will agree with me. Friends with benefits. Friends with benefits. That's a good expression when you could get it. Because the renders marriage obsolete. Amen. Amen to that sir. You're hoping we can.

And that check that was just, oh man, it was like right in my hand and all of a sudden. Oh. But that kind of coming for it. Oh, I'm never think of stories. Don't worry. I'm shredding those. WQA in, hello. Yes sir, good afternoon. Yes sir, good afternoon, be a sir. We don't need any new articles on the road. Because we know you'll read them all on the air. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. That was it.

Some of that pretty well to me. 560 and 560 and 560 and 560 and 560 and the horizon. Remember what I said before about people who think that they're very funny. Like Bill Marvier example.

They hated it. Too much hate down there. Stop hating. We each out and tap somebody on the shoulder and say, I love you. Or just just lie about you. Let me go on the hall to do that. Yeah, go on the hall and grab somebody. Go get Tommy and kiss him on the cheeks. I love you Tommy. He'll smack you on. He says, would you just relax? Rich says, fuck, Ruckers is still around the Dave County. See if he's been more time in Dave County. You'd find out what's really going on. Talkin' out of me? Yeah. Well Chris lives there. He ought to know. He doesn't know. You think you got all we should know where the food is though. It says it's in to round the international mall. Sonic is also in Dave County still. See if he's going Dave County. Find a good stuff. Finally, there's also a godfather's pizza and sat a head station on bird road. Next to Tammy and me park. So I'd be like that. And of course the godfather's, which I know we asked the one on baby road extension. In the head station, I think that was the first head station that had the godfather's Remember that came by a couple times. Did that brought us pizza? Uh huh. And it was to any old pizza doesn't really travel all that well as you know. I mean, traditional style does. But I'm talking about that kind of sick girl, the sick kind. Like steak. Steak doesn't travel well. If you're going beyond the year. Although over the years, I guess we've had people brought us in steak. And then it was always Smith and Malenski came here. I'm so sorry. Go there speaking of expressions. Don't even go there. I like to eat that one. That's one of my least favorites. Don't even go there. Oh, brother. So godfather's is still around. But not like the original one. No, that was saved. It was safe. This person that went on sunset with my buddy, hobbyier. Hey hobbyier, Connolly here and sit in my lamp. Well, I sure wonder if he went to the pokey with the rest of the family. But she was a popular guy in there if he did. Here's one from Ed in Fort Lauderdale. He says, as Nercupai, as Nercupai. Hello, that was good. Not getting ahead of myself. It's Nercupai. I'm right. As nervous as a fokey pond in a balloon factory. That is cute. And that cute. Yes it is. Nervous as a fokey pond in a balloon factory. You know what I'm looking for, I can't. I'm probably this is a lot of not going to find it. I'm going to put that on there. I'm sure. Because that's it's cute, but who to hell ever heard of that? Anybody ever hear that? Nobody ever say no. No. I think we're approaching a thousand on the pole. Get ready. Get ready for a real exciting moment here. 997. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Say I don't want to let that thing go all the way through. A little just a little just a little. No, no, no, that was good. Try it again. Okay, that was good. About a half a bomb. Which George is half a bomb is better than none. That's what you were supposed to write.

Okay, you're done. How are you spelling? Who to thunk it? Ha ha ha. I'm trying to spell it. Oh, man. Not to that Chris. It goes to sure the fat people are the funny people. You know, just look at him. You're like, seriously. He's a funny guy. Don't realize you're funny. But you'll see. He's funny. Look. He's halfway there. Oh, no. That was a gratuitously. It was honest. Of course. But it was gratuitously nasty. And that's where you always do that. Well, he hasn't fought me on here. You know, feeling bad about that. He doesn't have a hot girlfriend to come in here and give me a handful of ass. I don't know. He doesn't have a hot girlfriend. Trust me. Or you've seen his girlfriend. I haven't seen no. Of course not. If he had I'd seen her by now. You know what that would be like. It would be like somebody showing you a baby picture. And you say, you know, proud father or mother just had. They just had a baby. And you say, gee, that's the ugliest baby I've ever seen in my life. You just not going to do that. No, you're not. So the fact that you're saying he doesn't have a hot girlfriend. How do you know? Because he doesn't have any. Somebody said the other day he said he was like, so he's working on one. I don't know what he's working on it. I think I don't know what he's working on it. I think I don't know what he's working on it. I think I don't know what he's working on. Nobody closes the deal. Nobody QA. I'm hello. Closes the deal. Yes, sir. Oh, the God. Great. How about that? Who's as a excuse? No, that's a excuse. Any close. Okay, this is a ghost. Yeah. I mean, he sounds like he goes getting a tickled by that. Like what the feather, like what the goose feather or goose down. What is goose down? You know how they make a goose down feathers? Is that all this? Well, why can they just call a goose feathers? Goose down physically. I'm sorry. Is the feathers from the. I'm not getting in the pole. No, I'm not. No, yeah. Don't count your chickens before they had. That's another stupid expression. You know, this, this pulled it even though there's a lot of stupid crap on here. It makes, it makes you realize how condition we are that so much of our lives, at least verbally, it's spent exchanging stupid asset expressions that we hear and we get hooked with them. You know, I just keep saying I'm all over and over again. Am I correct? I think. I'm so, but Robert Greeper, the, the Lord of the Board, the schmuck of the, a, a puck. He's, he's, he's, he's, that one is a, thanks a lot Dave. And the guy's name is Dave Ryder, not really the Dave Ryder radio Dave Ryder. I wonder if he's still alive. I don't know. Dave Ryder that hired me at WI and Z away from WI just news that that's quite a story. WI just news. Because I had in my contract at WNWS that if I stayed, I forget to be in the contract. I got a twenty twenty five thousand dollar bonus. And I stayed till the end of the video. And then after I, you know, I'll see you'll do the deal. And the meantime, I and Z hired me away and I tried to, I had to go to court and Cheryl's ex husband, the judge, Lenny, what was his name? Leonard, I can't think of what his name was. But anyway, we had to have a trial as to whether my noncompetal would hold up in court or I could go to WI and Z. And of course, we won. And we rockblats since the one of his funky attorneys in there to, you know, argue my case, the judge, Lenny, or you came up with his name? No. Whatever you drive and he buzzed has to pay. Let me mark 10. I can't think of what his name was. Some Jewish guy. Well, I don't know. You know, Cheryl was married to him. You know, he was Jewish and he had a lot of money. That wasn't rippkin. Leonard Rippkin. And that's, well, what do you say like that? Yeah, Leonard Rippkin. No, he has two easy. Because that's the, that's the, that's the. That was the last thing. All the time we knew her. That's before her latest Jewish wealthy. Thousand three votes now. Now you can turn this thing. Now all over the place. One more. I share it. Thousand three votes. I mean, nothing that's a big deal. It's pretty weak. As a matter of fact. And the good part, I'm sure. A hundred and nineteen points. Six percent. Hate to pull. Let's not too bad for this crowd to this very, Ancy hostile crowd. All right. Now maybe you can tell me about Sonic. Because I already got like 75 emails from one of my correspondence on here about Sonic was, you know, panic to find out. It's like the godfather thing, right? See, there are a lot of these well kept secrets. And there's places around. It just like the thing with crystal there on power line and sunrise of the guy called yesterday. Remember? Remember every six months we bring that up. And how many people really know that? How many people are really horny for his little burgers from crystal? No. If there's one around, you might have to drive 40 miles to get there. And the same thing with Sonic. I don't even, it was Sonic like a W kind of like a drive in, drive through. That's right. That's exactly right. I mean, you could get out. They had the little tables on the outside, but it was a car hop kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't think it was that far. Oh man. Yeah, all these is Chicago places by the way. No, there'll be a pizza for like 75 bucks. And listen, no problem, man. And better be a really good pristine shape when it gets through too. Now, what is this thing here? It says hopefully this helps someone share this when I first started out. What is this about? I'm sorry. I fact that page before I realize that there were nine other pages coming behind it. Oh, no. Oh, no. This is the glossary of all the term, yeah. Yeah. And escorted reviews and message board postings like GFA. All of it. We don't even get to be on C. So look, look, I can't read most of these on the other. No, you can't. But the good thing is, it's a condom. Isn't that sweet? Yeah. I got some good clarification about the girlfriend experience. Did you? Yeah. And can you like narrow it down and on the earth? Absolutely. As opposed to the normal mechanical kind of interaction that you might have with your brother. Around the world, I better not read with that. Don't. You know, where they just come and do their business and leave. The girlfriend experience involved somebody that will actually pretend to be your girlfriend. She'll talk to you kiss you. You know, so it's a more fulfilling encounter, I guess. Yeah. So there it is. But I have another angle. It's called WEE, the wife experience. That's where they don't have sex with you. But they do take your money and then have sex with one of your friends. Ha ha ha ha ha. All right. Excellent. ATM. Why can't we that on here? Well. Okay. So I didn't realize we just an act on him. I thought it was a place where you stuck your card and you got something valuable. But nevertheless. Okay. Moving right along. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Yeah. And I'm trying to think of what the hell the food was that we had a shift in. Was it some kind of bagels, maybe this was in Sarasota 1973. So it's 32, 34 years ago. See what I was talking about the other day. And all you punk stuff there, anybody under like 35. You know, to me, your punk is a bad word. But you're punk, you know, all you young whippersnappers. There's another one. Young whippersnappers. Now stupid thing that old fart say. I still want to know what old whippers. That's all to me for I'm never going to be an old fart. I mean, kind of few of we know. But I'm not old fart. I don't want to get like that. Not that I'm some young. I mean, I was as far as a cardboard box when I was 20. So what do you know this is a make? At least having consistent. Mm-hmm. But I just don't want to be like out of touch with, you know, the mainstream humanity. What I just want to know what a whipper is. Snappen what happens on your snap. If you whipper, snapper. All right. That's for your look person and for him. I have no idea what I was going to talk about. Oh, what is it? I'm so excited women and other countries as well, Al Goodman gets to the heart of the matter coming up next. Aren't or in the scene this is the same old American uptightness. And by anything else do with the body or sex rating like, Oh, G is unclean. And then evercrow me in fish catalog, yeah, whether off set because Allah is hot looking the young people, or in the evercrow me in fish catalog. And most of us look at the mirror of this flag and this fat, like, ah, it's easy. You know? That's what they're upset about. And probably because they're getting aroused as all hell by looking at it. And who the hell who's alive wouldn't be getting aroused by the evercrow me in fish catalog. And there's something there for everybody. And they're all legal, baby. They're all legal. If you like some grabs it and do something good with it, that's my suggestion. Get jiggy with it. Oh, so what's the, that's another stupid expression. Get jiggy with it. Huh? With it. Not with it. With it. Isn't that how it goes? Get jiggy with it? With it. That will Smithman. He just makes me want our cock on. Turn your right now. In fact, keep with the cock I'm leaving. All I get on is you. You're going to get jiggy with it. Yeah, you're getting jiggy with it. You're going to get jiggy without it pretty soon if you don't cut the cramp. Prop 48 a Q a m. Don't forget you want to Q m street 13. I keep reading this promo, but it's kind of like, I don't know. It is what it is. No one to two, that's not a two with the Verizon Wireless store. 100 South American Boulevard downtown. I mean, stop by to win prices. Get all the grass from the heat dancers. So what were you just telling me about the Sonic again? What's the big deal? It's a burger joint. It's a car, but it just happened to be really good. Like, you could get a bacon cheese burger and it was on them. Like, they had bread options. And I know that doesn't mean a whole lot to you, but you could have like a toasted sour dough slices. Two thick slices of toasted sour dough bread. Instead of the traditional bun, for example, the bacon was nice and thick and was good on there. And another one was like good, good, good, good, good hardy food and they, of course, yeah, hardy isn't Tampa. Well, they have a few. But I also shroom burgers, man. I say, I love them shroom burgers. I like hardy a lot too. Bacon shroom burgers and hardies. So you go up north to the south and they have the Sonic's or everywhere. And they're great. Well, there's one there in North Miami, I guess. North Miami? This is what I'm getting here from my buddy online is giving me. He went on. He got so excited by that previous. If the pre-work, whoever's going to tell me is, I need to give me like a what for, okay? Let me know exactly where this one put on here so something might find it. I'm just making sure they don't go there whenever anybody else wants to go. So it's not too overcrowded. And we do have a W here, but it's in the mall. Like in the Eaton Center, one of the food courts in a small crappy food court. There's an A in W. And still, there's still some of the same stuff. You know, the pop of burger and mama burger and the team burger and the baby burger and whatever. The dead burger. It's okay. And it's not like what you call great fast food cuisine, but it's okay. It's edible. WM Food Line. Hello. Good day, Mr. Rogers. Good day. Not on that. You have this one already, but it drives me nuts. No skin off my back. Yeah, no skin off my back. We're no skin off my ass. Right. It was really something. No one too. Okay. It's pali so skin off my ass. I would prefer putting an ass on there as opposed to back because I'm, you know, perverted and old, you know, whatever. Fag. Well, I mean, wouldn't you rather put ass on the pull as opposed to back? No skin and I never heard anybody say no skin off my back. You do. Yeah, but most of the time we say off my ass. You know, the person's waiting on the menu. There's plenty there. Anybody want some? I mean, I could use a little, you know, little chop chopper. Yes. WQA and hello. Hey, now. Yes, sir. I call you from Syracuse from time to time. I got a good one for your pull. Yes, sir. Get her done. Get her done. I thought we did that one already. Get her done. Saw my no votes. It sounded with no votes. Well, you better go vote for it, pali. Get her done. Okay. Get her done now. Oh. Get her done. I'm probably the farmer say that. You know, when got to go milk the cows, you know, get her done. You know, either being. Yeah. And I'm going to go around the house and find my wife. Get her being. What is disgusting thought that is for those people. I mean, for some people, it might be a very erotic thought. But for those people, let's say, grow test and horrendous thought. I mean, like to think that those people are reproducing. That's the problem. Maybe forced sterilization is what we need. They can do all the hecky spanky. They want. I don't want to be proud. Anybody have their happiness. But geez, Louie's no more, I'm making no more babies with them. People with that crowd that red, necky, in red crowd. Okay. Let's see what this says. It says, oh, yeah. Boca boxes and small potatoes. I mean, that's not the same. That's a, I mean, you know, small potatoes. It wasn't what I just made a name Mr. Roth. I don't know why. He just need just luck. We just got through with the thing where we're Frankie Pintangeli. Can you give your loyal being to a Jew before you? I'm glad. That's right. Small potatoes is both about well, I try. I haven't rocked to be very proud. But I would say. The board goes back. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. You know, for a poll that they claimed they hated like poison to be even the show. See, leave it to me. Leave it to this old flag that teach them that they liked it. You know what I'm saying? Because they're running to begin the show. I said to them. He like it. And his own, oh, no. Ha ha ha ha. Beech of that time. Yeah, it is. I got the quickest finger in the North. Baby, let me take it right. But I heard. Yeah, believe me. Go, no. Well, we'll see. W to Q a m. Hello. Hello. Mr. Mill. Yes, sir. How are you? Who is it? This is a man busy as a three-legged bird dog in the cuve of 12. Yeah. And. Oh, that was it. Okay. I'm out waiting because I was positive there. I would have had to be more because he sounded so. He sounded so authoritative and so pleased to be on the radio to share his ex-heal. He's a good boy. I'm so pleased to be on the radio to share his ex-heal. He's a good boy. So pleased to be on the radio to share his ex-heal. Would you like to share something? Ah. W to Q a m. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I got a couple for you. Okay. Five will get you 10. No, no. And that would be fine. I won't. Five dollars to get you 10 set. It would be fine. Yeah. Maybe that's what they meant by that. Five will get you 10 set. Yeah. Okay. Got a pal. See. Yeah. Sure, take a look. How long have you must have on that feather again? First the feather was in his cap and then it was to be in the back dome. Got in his place somewhere because he was just tickled with that for that. It was okay. It was, you know, well, not maybe the greatest call in the history of the human race. Seriously. Well, when is the last time we did anything like this that's had this kind of response. I mean, it's probably only 75 million super express. But when is the last time? And now, are you going to find out where that damn sonic was? I'll, I'm sure I'll get the information. Yeah. I'm not going to, huh? I mean, I'm not going to drive a lot. I'm going to tell you right now I'm going down to my amigo finds sonic. Not. But those would see that's another thing. Like adventure car hop and saw this mess. I told you, are any warning from our, are any woo, woo, woo, get and not are any warning? Are the Ginsburg from WMX and Boston, he owned that. Adventure car hop. Anyway, great place on the way to rocking and park to lose our money back when I was in Boston in the early 60s. Always with stop at Adventure car hop. And it was, those were great the old car hops. Am I right? Yeah. No, I like the A and W's to go to all the time. And in some of those places, the girls would come out on roller skates. That's right. Am I right? Yes. And of course, then when they would trip and fall and trade would go flying and all your food on the ground, it wasn't quite so cute when the food would go flying. And those, some of those hetero guys got to look up her dress while she was flopping. That's right. Whatever. That's right. Over that change. Sarah, over there. She just took a slip and fall and all the food and flying, but look at that. You know, back though. Yeah. That's what it looks like to me. But never left. So we are really kicking a big fat window. We'll find out where that sonic is. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if George takes the whole family out this week in the Sonic. Ha ha ha ha ha. I'll pay if one was close by you. And you know, though, I'm going to find out for you. Is North Miami's not like a million miles from Hollywood where you are for Christ's legs, would you go down down? No, but still. Last time I looked at Christ, whatever his name is, Josh Cortes, hadn't put no stories up. Where are you Josh? Yeah. So you know that check. I was thinking about for Josh that occasionally I said, I'm going to just in a good mood. You know, send a wish. I shop, Josh. You've got an easy payable that you snap all bananas for their show segments. Like that one to two hour. This court finds you. Jumpy, I don't tell you. You're fairing for this. Burning jail. Where is the part in the need of the most? I can't believe this. I can actually go to jail. I'm in jail. Because Scooter may have been his totally toast. Ah crap. Not working for you. They're right. They said he's guilty all the way. He lied him out. Who's wrong? I'm afraid. And we just need to see him go. Not happy, aren't you? So the sunlight just together too warm. The whole story was like a safe life. How the Burton's dry high while we're getting poor. We'll never be able to afford my signature. But shen, shen, shen, you must have been high. To think we left them, ruin our lives. And we just need to see them go. Let me hide a bad day. Scooter's from my mouth. Keep the fences on, but they'll pick it out. This way you are cold. Cheating sends a mic. There won't go a down, because they all did that spy. You'll never say we've been fleering lies. Don't feel on them, tell them you can change you to a time. You'll be a self-made. Oh, right. You'll shoot with the face. Uh-huh. 101 and 560 WCM. It's our award-winning gigantic one to two. Let me just take a look and see. Now, maybe I'm picking on Josh Cortis needlessly. But I think he probably did. Was he, you know, he posted the stories and he forgot to hit the button. Whatever. No, there's nothing on there. There's nothing on there. And work, work, can he be working? Not being? Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Then it texted. And say, hey, you jackass. You just blew a nice fat check down the drain. Because you need to do a new job. I mean, wouldn't it make sense for him to like to double check after we does? I just just see if they're on here. Like, oh, yeah, unless there's all them 20 stories in the same year or sometime, 8 or 9 or 10, or only 7 or 8 on the weekends, you know, because I don't want to overwork his fat ass. But nevertheless, we do the best we can. How should this year recommend you to him in John Conner's today? Yes, I'm sorry. Well, whatever. Send a letter to US Attorney General Alberto Vio Fadganzallas demanding answers to allegations that he may have advised the president to shut down an investigation of the White House's domestic wiretapping surveillance program because of his involvement with the program. It would be an extraordinary abuse of authority if he would advise the president on this matter. I've heard learning that your own conduct was to be investigated. Conner's wrote. Rothstray reported earlier yesterday in a statement released by Senator Russ Fangold that his president or concerns about the reports concerning the attorney general's possible rule in blocking an investigation which he may have been a target. I'll write. Put him all in jail through a way to key. Conner's also issued a statement about ABC News reports of emails looking Carl Roe to the US Attorney firing scandal. These latest reports have toured our proof positive that lower level officials in the district department are being hung out to dry so the statement this goes all the way to the top of the district department and the senior White House stand. Conner's question of the truthfulness of testimony given to the US Congress by the Justice Department and but it would be put in the office of the public and they would be able to see the public and it would be a very clear statement. I'm sorry, I should have read the letter. I'd turn up on the area. My 60. Con 50. We were fine. We're so pleased. When you're not going to anyone. Chris found out he looked. The one is in Naples. Now that is not true. Really? Because I'm on their website and I put in for the closest one within 150 miles of my email. I'm going to email here to my office. I'm going to email you. I'm going to email you. I'm going to email you. I'm going to email you. I'll be from somebody who said there's a son of Canadian to get the guy. They must be drinking something because go to the Sonic website. Close this one in the west coast. The closest one is on the west coast. Correct. Are you sure? Well, we'll get to the bottom of that before this hour is out. I'm going to tell you right now. Right. We'll get to the bottom of the sonic dilemma. We'll find out what intersection it's supposed to be at. It's a strange arrangement. WK, that's the QAN hello. It's the same kind of checkers. So I don't think there's any sonic down here. No way. No way. Checkers down here. You have this trouble checker down there. You got it. Okay. I have a say how the down deliways. I'll checkers. Well, this is a real dilemma that we got in the middle of now all of a sudden. Like one minute one guy saying one thing and then the next minute I'm getting the message yet. There was one. I found he did a, he did a, he did a, he did a, some kind of a search. And Chris of course, who's to anything has to do with food he searched in for it with both hands. WQA and sonic line. Hello. Yes sir. What's going on? How you doing? Love in the show today. Of course. Pretty confident on you. Well, you got pali. Nothing. Okay. Pretty confident on our to. Ah, yeah. In your case, I'm sure you're like it because what else you're going on? I have no love. Nothing. Yeah, this is turned into a real mystery. Now real dilemma, the sonic thing. You know, one minute I'm hearing. One minute. And the next minute I'm hearing. Another thing. And then probably a couple minutes. I don't know. So I, if everybody in Dave Kelly or even all of us outflow to hit out for sonic tonight. Just start looking for different stuff in every street quarter and say, don't they is sonic? Don't they is WQA and hello? Yes sir. Good morning. If you watch on this pan, the Valerie plane says the money. Old people should be brought to the far end squad. Yeah. Okay. Well, we know that. It's old news. WQA and hello. Yes sir. I can't believe it's been an hour man. Nobody's given you the real definition of the GSE. Yes. It's a code word man. Yeah. The code word. The girl will do a monocleointee without a condom. They said. What was that nice? Okay. Well, I was that on the sheet you had there that gave you all that information. Here I know. I never got that far. Thank you Steve. We got it here. North Miami 149. 75 West six you highway. What a guy. So now we need an agent to go over there. And order up a bacon cheeseburger. North Miami 149. 75 West six you highway. Well, I think I think we got to like, say them a bill or something. Because you know the power of the show back when we used to have an audience back when people used to hit. Let's let me so on. I remember those days. Wasn't that long ago, man? Till Joe Bell came to town. What does that Peggy Eddon feel to get with no teeth? The child. Oh, the child lived in the same mobile home park as the suspect. Oh, mobile home park. See trailer trash. See what I'm saying. I don't want to knock everybody lives in a trailer park. But Josh says the story's been up there. What city was that also? What what are you talking about? One 49 75 West. Dixie Highway North Miami. Okay. What are you questioning now? I got that information from my main man on there. My number one course from the viewers. And the early calendar. You're questioning. Have you heard? No, he's not an eagle. He was illegal. Aliah. Oh, you never know. What am I looking for? Oh, I'm looking for the stories are not there. Well, if they are, then he must have posted them with yesterdays or something like that. See, the stories may be there. But the stats are just not showing up on it. I don't know. And you know what? I'm sorry that I even mentioned. Sorry, Josh. And you're still not getting no check. What did he say? What did he say? What did he get? What did he get? He said he got no check and then he came back. And here he is now. And he says I checked in the rupt there. Yeah. But what about on the stats? Did you show us no stories? It shows no stats. He said that about his. How big are you? He says it does on his. It's your stats on your page for today? Yes. It's about 660. That's the 1077. This doesn't show any story where anybody doesn't even show anybody. Get out of here. I saw a gaslight man and you've got to be kidding me. Boring moving.. It was great. Yeah, there's no sonic on that address either. Well, what does that mean? Oh, this is turning into a mess. How do you know there's no sonic on that address? Yeah, have a store locator button. You put any address or even just like a town and how many miles away from that address And it tells you where the closest ones are Maybe maybe it's subsonic Maybe a super sonic Yeah, that would be a shame if people started wasting their time going there and like it come to find out it wasn't there. Maybe it's a decoy, you know That's right somebody's waiting there to mug something else there maybe there's one of those hot to go's left over from the Pepsi people Wasn't it Pepsi was it coke? I think was Pepsi wouldn't Don't recall they stared at the hot to go because they were pissed off because the other chains were only doing Coca-Cola coke instead of Pepsi and so is as the way of rebuilding we're gonna show you guys a thing or two We're gonna put all you fast food guys out of business so they open up those hot to go They were so hot and they did go they were guys and go away Pepsi has lots of businesses like Taco Bell and KFC for example Miguel said he's gonna go check for us Check for you one. It's gonna go drive over to the address He's gonna drive over to that address to see if the sonic is really there. Well, that would be quite a good Better do they're damn few stations in America that would do that for you Or they have the promotions guy go and drive over to see if they're really a such a place And we're big time here Huh, we're big time we can maybe that was out there information at my buddy found on the internet There that could be it. I mean just because it's on the internet. It might have been there 75 years ago It might have been there when George Washington was a baby for all we know But we'll I'm a girl's gonna go right over there and check that to me sounds like that Not far from where the well now it says up to three a few blocks because I used to live there in in twin likes racking club I'm 441 and 100 and I want to say 51 right by the way your golden blades interchange back when they were like 10 or 20 white people live in that neighborhood and part of time I mean, I'm just I'm just saying it like it is you know Not for the same thing wrong with that but that part of town is kind of changing them graphics in the intervening years Ericsies yes the stories were posted with the wrong date for some reason. You won't see the stats until tomorrow I don't really care what the stats are all that much is just that if I don't see anything on there to me I start getting panicking like that you know me Yeah, just like that because I think oh, eras what's his name? Giants didn't put them up there at all.

I don't recall ever having one there. I thought that's one of the things they were really famous for it. I'm not sure. What do you say Chris? Chris never went to Sonic. Did you? Yeah, a couple of times. You didn't. You don't sound too excited about it. Well, the shakes is a bit of steak in shake. I don't think I ever had a shake there.
