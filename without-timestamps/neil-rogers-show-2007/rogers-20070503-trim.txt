You don't always believe in the view. Boy, America's sure going to miss her, propaganda pushing big, muff, blabbering nonsense like this. You wanted a wide-weigh going to Iran. For the money, that's why we would do it. I do believe that it's the five physics for the world traits that are tower seven to fall the way it's sell without it's slow and big involved. Do you think the government perfectly misread the American peoples of the league that Iraq has something to do with 9-11? Yes, it's a proud. In America, we are fed propaganda. And if you want to know what's happening in the world, go outside of the US media. It's pretty obvious to anyone that listens that Rosie hates America. The radical Christianity is just as threatening as radical Islam. But she loves the people who are trying to kill us. And Iran is a danger. Iraq and Afghanistan never threatened to kill us. Don't ever disparage anyone who's trying to kill us to Rosie. I use a terrorist. You think that robes them of their humanity. That mean terrorists makes them not human anymore. Yep, Rosie loves the terrorists. But apparently she has absolutely no compassion or sensitivity for Asians. So you know, you can imagine a treetail. Like, she knows we got to jump all the time. She's not a Danny D. B. No, she's not. She's not. We're on the buggy. She's strong. Rosie's finally leaving the view and pretty much every rational American is thrilled about it, especially Donald Trump. Earlier, Donald's discussed it. I mean both inside and out, we take a look at it. She's a slob. She drops like a truck driver. Rosie is a loser. Well, 10 or two. She's kind of like a larger version of a female bill Mar in my book. I, you know, I hate to say that. He doesn't have the same snazzy's got. He doesn't have the big, you're disgusting fat, growtisc. Body that she doesn't growt me out as quickly as she does. No. They have to agree with most of what both of them say and that and that's proof of what I always tell you. Who cares? Who cares? They're still both annoying and disgusting. I'll let nobody can be as disgusting as she is. What up? Oh. You saw that hanging upside down thing that she did there? No. They were showing it on the news, though. Oh, I love to see that. I love to see that. Oh, you don't want to see that. I want to see that. Oh, from a rope. Yeah. Well, what was the point of it? She has, she's depressed. She has depression. So to feel better, she hangs upside down. I have a solution for depression. Yeah. Inversion therapy, I think she was calling it. All right. So she hung upside down to these bungee cords. And if he thought she looked gross right side up. I'm sure she's hung. Oh. Anyway, let's get to it. OK, like I said, we got a lot of important fish to fry. Maybe all the most need of marr. We got the ratings coming to 10 o'clock. That's going to be, I don't know what word to use for it. How about it? Part of that. I don't know. I could be. It could be brutal. We imagine this show at least we got one month. Our February was not spectacular. But relative do what was surrounding us. It was free day. It was OK. It was OK. Not that, they're phenomenal. But just OK. And so maybe that'll, if we have a decent march, you never know what these things, right? Right. One thing I think we do know is don't start the planning on spending any famous money because there isn't going to be any. Even Chris, that big bonus usually gets. Uh-huh. Oh, and the good news for Chris is now already told on this one for one. If I was you, I'd start marking on a calendar. I made it through the entire day yesterday. It was wood bind Wednesday and no sugar, no crap, no refined carbs. I went upstairs to the race track level. I got two slices of pizza. And you think you're always eating pizza, no. I got four. I got a fork. I ate the cheese in a papy room. You off the top and I threw the crust away. Didn't eat very good. Very good. The crust. Very good. And you're doing sugar free. That's what if you dive out. What is it? Sugar free may. Is that what you're doing? Yeah. Sugar free may. Good. I'll do it with it. And I may just get through it. I'm one for one, one day. I mean, one day at a time. Oh, no. That's the good time with those themes we got today. One day at a time. It was a horrible show and probably a horrible thing too. Yeah. Bad show bad thing. Now sometimes his bad shows with good things like Barnaby Jones always gets his man. That's right. Great. We have our figure out his bill Ross did that used to do the voiceovers on channel 7 must be. And what about Dick Fennel? Don't know. From channel 4. Well, what used to be channel 4 wasn't it? See how good confused because we're used to be channel 4 is not channel 6. Well, it used to be channel 6 is now, I don't know, channel 4. Remember when channel 6 had John Hamburg and Kenbro Marshall and all the people who remember those days? I did it back in the day. Now we got Tony Sigerweta. Whatever happened to sloppy Jennifer Velopi. She kind of flew the coupe. Yeah, I didn't notice. I guess what they decided they were going to pick her ass up in a limo every day and take her to the channel 6 studio. Talk about a ego. Talk about a big fat puffed up ego, but nevertheless. So we got Dave Johnson calling him and they're Kentucky Derby, a preview that we've been doing over a year since regret won the Derby in 1915. I think that was Dave's first call. And we'll see. I stay when you got a horse named her way for Holly Wood. How can you not like that horse? They'd be a way for Holly Wood. Huh? I should like that. Sure. Since I live in a way. No, I got a shot. He's got a shot, baby. That's going to be my pick. I think I'm picking it right now. I got my finger deep inside my nostril. Almost scratching my brain a little bit just a tan. Where to raw story. Always after 9, 11 attacks, gotled, rummese felled. Allegedly said my interest is to hit Saddam. Now is now a richer clerk also said the same thing. Yes. Yes. According NBC's chief Pentagon correspondent former defense secretary, Donald rummese felled said that his interest is to hit Saddam Hussein just hours after the attacks on 9, 11. Even the wall indications for the nail cut is the guilty party of Rhode Island newspaper be seen. At the annual Business Expo with Rhode Island Convention Center Tuesday NBC's Jim McLean of the Shafsky advanced day theme, garnering attention since former CIA director George Tenomade's public revelations last week, writes Tom Mooney for the Providence Journal. Some things are right on mark when he says the Bush administration appeared predisposed to attack Iraq, McLean of Shafsky says of Tenomade's book at the center of the storm. The NBC correspondent's information comes from author record notes given to him from an identified person who was in the White House situation room in the hours after the attacks. Another note described, McLean Sharfsky said, then secretary defense rummese fell, following to avenge the terrorist attacks by voicing frustration that attacks against the US Embassy in Beirut in 1983 and the attack on the coal in 2000 had gone on avenged Mooney, right? Reading from his notes, McLean Sharfsky quoted rummese called to saying five hours after the terrorist attacks, my interest is to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time we go after Al Qaeda. We ought not only look at a son of Bin Laden rummese, but allegedly said before holding your conference call of President Bush during the conversation once felt says not to focus solely on Al Qaeda, consider all the range of options and the presence response was. Yes. Siddna Kleschewski, so there's no question that Tenomade got the time wrong with meeting Pearl in the White House, but there's no question in his mind with some of the conversations he had with officials in the Pentagon. That the Bush administration at their site said, I'm attacking Saddam Hussein and Iraq long before there was even an effort to gather any evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved in the attack. All the evidence says quite the opposite, quite contrary, Mary, and Harry, and it's pretty scary, but nevertheless, okay, let's take over that poll results. George was out to the case today, so he said to me, this morning we're going to do that poll on the omnis? Yeah. There's a bit behind the times. In fact, we chopped that one off and mixed three minutes to the, because I didn't like that poll. You thought I was, well, I was okay. Well, I didn't like the omnis. What was the one that he before that had 1600 votes? I don't know, I forget what that was, but I didn't like it at all. And it got a lot of votes. 905 was the final telly. We were trying to cut it off at 900. And so we put today's poll on there early. Our goal today is a thousand votes. We've got 111, I think we can do 15 again, Chris. I think we can't also. Let's give it a shot. Let's go for 1500 during the show. If we do that today, I'm taking off the rest of the year. All right. Anyway, the poll from yesterday, if you had to, if I had to live among the omnis, I don't know how to get ever get through a day without electricity. 346, it varies everything else. And now I'm present with many of the other things on here. Early, some of many way, you couldn't do it without electricity. For example, number two is a computer. 113, I'll let you have batteries, right? Right. Anyway, electricity 346, computer one, 13, cold beer 91. Only drugs for the same thing. Can't have warm beer either. Well, yeah, they can't have warm beer, even like P. Warm beer. They can't have that. I am serious to crank vote. I am honest. So what the FMI doing in the computer answering this poll. Oh, right. No, no chance. 82, like you would believe that. We don't have any omnis people listening to this show. Even if they could, a TV 71, porn 67. A refrigerator 31, a car 26, casual clothes 21, Cussing 17, radio 12, only 12, Solomon, they do say. Cell phone 10, sneakers 6 and iPods 6. I don't know. I mean, you know, I got a nice iPod there, but that really wound my day if I couldn't do it on my iPod. A CD pair of 3 and DVD pair, two fast food, finally got a vote and a microwave all the way through. None. None. Stamped it by a crowd being pushed by police. Three members of the media ended up in the hospital. Many people were left with large wealth. Oh, that's LA. And other than they like to be people up in LA, it doesn't take to live there anyway. On 9,500, so unless you speak for a resound, which is it's got all those symbols and drawings and one of those oriental languages, you have no business being in LA anyway, right? Right. So why do you like folks get out of there? Okay, let's take a look at, oh, and before we do the fool for today, why got a lot of fish to fry today, man. We got a lot on our plates. Speaking of that, do you have any food in there today or what? Yeah, how is it? My bacon already? I had my bacon. No crap today again. And Chris, you know, doubting time, says, oh, you have big duty made one day, one day, oh, one day at a time. There you go again. That's the way you love people. As you know, fat people, everybody else to be fat. They want to defail. Chris is sitting there hoping that I get like my left leg chopped off, you know, gang green. Not that one to be good. Former radio talk show host, Don I miss has heard one of the country's top trial orders to sue CBS radio following his dismissal last month for making a racial and sexual honor comments about members of the Rutgers University Women's Basketball team, which is where Georgia's supposed to drop in. Murphy, that man it is. There it is. Attorney Martin Garber's told CNN yesterday that he's agreed to represent Amis and a wrongful breach of contract suit against his former employer. Garber's would not disclose when he was retained by Amis, but said he plans to file an action against CBS in their future, calls made to Amis by CNN were not returned. He's probably kind of surly these days when you think he's snatched an ad gum extra hard. CBS spokesman to climb a comment. I'm a said $40 million left on a multiyear contract to begin in 2006 and food reclaws that CBS wanted him to be irreverent and controversial according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Tubman who was shown part of the contract. CBS radio acknowledges that are the, I'm a service just to be rendered here under a unique extraordinary irreverent intellectual topical kind of official and personal character and the programs of the same general type of nature containing these components are desired by company and consistent with company rules and policies. You're reverent, controversial, and you're adiatic. Tubman said the legal issues in the Amis case are simple that Amis breaches contract by saying what he did about the Rutgers basketball team by calling them. Napier to go. CBS dismissed Amis April, Trophy days after we called the Rutgers players. Napier to the hose on his radio shows. Amis in the moment. Well, stands out in the contract as he is supposed to be controversial under Reverend. That's what his statement about the Rutgers basketball team was Tubman said. How is CBS going to argue that what he said was so controversial and so offensive that it wasn't what they asked for in the contract? We wanted you to be a little controversial, a little bit offensive and a little bit irreverent, but not the Napier to the hose done, not the Napier to the hose. How about a happy hit to hose? So I occasionally have one of those. Happy hit to hose. It all depends on where it's been. I guess. 1013 at 560WQ and looks like it's scheduled. We have mad dog from 2 to 5.

Stored student faces expulsion after making a thread over a bad grade. I see. Yeah, I got to see. See my ass. Don't have that good eyesight for that. Well, this kid got pissed off. A Stuart high school student who was failing math threatened his teacher with a virginity textile massacre authorities. B. Say. The 18 year old student made the thread April 25 after the teacher told him he was failing the class according to a Martin County Sheriff's office report. If that happens, I'm going to shoot. It's going to be another virginity text incident. The student's expulsion is pending a psychological evaluation and a meeting with Martin County School District officials. He's listed his a suspect, but hasn't been arrested. Currently stored news for that reason. The AP isn't naming the student. Well, he's 18. He's old enough out of what his name in there and a picture too. See if he's cute. Anytime any student makes any kind of threat threatening violence, we take that very seriously.

And the article I had the other day was that I had several pieces. And the bottom line was that they're going to be 70s and 80s. You know, we have enough stations playing 70s and 80s already. Now, who was it who said was it McGeele? Who said it or you, Chris, about well, big plays 70s and 80s rock as opposed to magic with play 70s and 80s pop. That would have been McGeele as in pop goes the weasel or something like that. Oh, I haven't heard that in a long time. Let's give that on there right away. Pop goes the weasel. No, not you. You know, you have pop goes the weasel. I don't think that. But I could find it. I mean, it's a colleague goes that we out of one hour. That's a need. That's for little children. That's right. Two Democratic members of Congress during represented Dennis Cassinux in co-spotswing articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney. One accused Cheney of an arrogant abuse of power that needs to stop represented wooden lacy clay of Missouri during Cassinux in Spotswing and Resolution Initiative in impeachment proceedings. At the urging of my constituents at Missouri's first congressional district and from Americans across the country, I co-sponsored Congressman Cousinux is resolution regarding the impeachment of the Vice President because I believe that Mr. Cheney deliberately manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the Congress of the US and the work in people representative said, Mr. Stamon sent to raw story. Does get much raw than that? Here are the raw of the crowd. He added that to Sidon's resulted in a tragic unnecessary war that has already cost lives over 33 hundred brave Americans and cost the taxpayers over $400 billion. The arrogant abuse of power and the complete disregard for the truth needs to stop. Representative Jan Jackowski of Illinois also spotted the Cassinux Resolution spokesman for the Congress member said she had to decide to release his statement on why she supported the measure. While Cassinux is articles of impeachment that finally picked up co-sponsues, they still face another major procedural hurdle. A spokesperson for the House Judiciary Committee told Atlantic Progressive News that the impeachment movement has yet to be put on the committee's plate. Put it on the plate, okay? Get a knife and a fork and stick it. It's not at this time on a committee's immediate agenda. Melanie Russell is the first person to represent at John Congress of Michigan. Be saying it.

I did. Thank you, George. You're welcome. Yeah, so we can't know there's one on here that we can't play on the airway. That's right. So I know that. I know that. I checked it. I checked it. You're on the way. Just to make sure we don't have to keep dumping the stuff. Yeah, that would be funny. Right. And then last and least. And then the one I for that is. Yeah. I stuck that baby down there between my legs. Between my knees and my vibrating. Yeah, that's my vibrating. Right. Holy, whew. Vibrating mode. In fact, where is that thing vibrating mode? We still have that? Sure. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. MHD vibrating. MHD. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. He just makes this crap up as you go along.

That building would collapse. Still 1298. But we're on a verge of 13. I read that. That's the point. We got the 1500. Looked easy. And I know as time goes on here today. We'll see just exactly where we are. I want to go with you. What do you say? In other words, we will see what kind of a goal. Said life is all about sitting goals and making them. You know what I'm saying? Like if you see somebody looks really good in your mind. You said a goal and say, I want that. If I'm in in the course, it's about going out and getting it. You know, we should not grab in it. But squeezing it. Fondling it. Go. Like that. Mm-hmm. Like that. Doug Thompson, capital to whole blue. He's done a piece today. Everybody ought to get a piece today. He says probably a lot of hangovers that depending on this morning. Just like the one George had yesterday morning. Mm-hmm. But a lot of high-wrecking brass went out and got blasted after listening to the president and bushes speech about his veto on the rack funding bill. Or they reach for the anti-depressants after watching Bush claim that all he wants to do is listen to the military and express what it comes to his favorite rack war. All I really want to do is not to share so I didn't share do that. I actually liked that song. And I'm not to big on her. Oh, what do you? All I really want to do is that something in share. Sing a little more. All I really want to do is make love to you and to go to the zoo and put on a movie with evidence. Oh, man. I like that. Now is it share or something in share? Code. The motive. Both of them together. I've come online to one's dead and the anti-depressants. Listen to that for some more. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Yeah, this is a song. No, no, no. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay, beginning. Start judging. Do you listen to my good? Uh, no, that's let me take that. Whoop. What was wrong with that? Anyway, he Said is no kidding. That's what the man said. Bush claims that he wants all the ones who is listening to military experts when it comes to his Federal Rack war. Probably to go to their Thompson says I asked the Congress to vote and this is what he's quoting. Bush, probably to ask the Congress to pass an emergency worst-fitting bill that will provide our brave young man and women in uniform with the funds and flexibility they need. Instead, members of the House of the Senate passed a bill that substitutes the opinions of politicians for the judgment of our military commanders, so a few minutes ago I vetoed the bill he said. Yep, Bush now claims that he ranked the buckle as the military's war, he had nothing to do with it. Unlikeing the right of the commanders to determine the war policy of this nation, damn the politicians full speed ahead. Apparently, Bush no longer considers himself a ready-vis political appointee to be politicians of a just suffering for one of his many memory lapses. He forgets that politicians got us into this mess in the first place. Vice President Cheney's a politician, so a former defense secretary of Rumsfeld, both our career politicians have ignored the advice military commanders and set American men and women to die and ill-conceived war based on lies. The military experts urged caution by the politicians of the White House ignore the advice and launched the war that is not cost America more than 3500 lives, $500 billion and four years of wasted effort. Now, Bush says we must stop listing the politicians, let the commanders run the war? Back in 2003, the commanders urged Bush to stick to the battle plan in Afghanistan, capture Osalab and London and forget about Iraq. If he had listened to the military commanders back then, we probably wouldn't be mired in the Iraq civil war that we started that we can't win and that his destiny would go down in history as America's most monumental foreign policy blunder ever. Back then, Bush had the politicians in his hip pocket live the country in a rowzing course of over there while sending others to death in his war. Now that voters turned out his rubber stamp Congress and elected new leadership that America wants out of Iraq Bush decides its time to stop listing the politicians, at least any politicians who disagrees with him. And in doing so, we setting up Iraq military commander General David Patreis to be his fall guy when we leave Iraq into feet sometime in the future. If a loyal soldier Patreis takes orders from his commander and chief, that's the problem. The commander and chief is also the president of the United States. Last time we checked the president is also a politician. For us, George W. Bush told the truth, he said politicians are the problem case closed. Right, sir, buddy, Doug Thompson. And if it loses, he's still alive, okay? Their hunting is asked down and one of these days I hope they'll not find him, but nevertheless, they probably will. And then you won't see him no more. Doug Thompson. They've tried to shut his eyes down, you're aware of that. That's not just making that out. No, I remember the story you're reading and he was out of view out of sight there for one. Yeah, he was hiding and fearing for his life because the gun stop was coming to find his ass. 13. I was six on the pool. By the way, Chris is pretty damn excited about this. Even though it doesn't sound like he was making a lot of noise because he's too fat to get that animated. I'm always like, I've been there done that. Been so fat they can barely breathe. You know, it's not a kind of trouble for you. We've barely breathed. That was funny. Thunderfall. WTV. 560. This is man behind the black curtain car roll.

He could pass for 97 easy. Am I right? Yeah. Easy. Those tips they showed on CNN today, I... He looks like an ancient old lady. I mean, a real old lady, a great-great grandma in a chair. Like a little lady in a chair. When he's swimming, he wants the job back for one. For one? Neppiated old. Oh, is that what it is? God, Almighty, how much money is that old fart made in all these years? They were paying him 7 million a year to be a day man in a chair. I'd take that. Christ, even I'm not making that. Close. No, not even close. 13 every 17 eric by the way is good little exasperated with some of these colors. There he says, what's your or some of the facts of his well? What's your favorite theme song from a 70's TV sitcom? And he's got the sitcom and dark, black, big letters underline sitcom. Not, you know, I mean, oh, there he is again. Look at that. I'm a spy man. He put the eye in the word dead. You're a fart at the rancher. Good. What a colleague, Miss Molli. Look at that. Oh, he took anybody's near CNN. Don't you know, you boy, you brain. You know, even if you are nine, you'll feel pretty good about yourself because Jesus, 13, 17 is what we got on the thing. And I think it was Brandon Pondott, so like green acres and merrily hulbulies. They were really 60's. But I think both of them slapped into the early 70's. So it's okay. Neppiated hose. Well, I'm just looking at the story. Neppiated old. Yeah, mash 162. It's a really good battle between mash and all the family, 155. So maybe if we want to see just this, don't I should try to goose up all in a family a little bit? What's that? Oh, that's a bit. All I'm going to wrong this. Okay, when that happens? Yeah, a little way to lame. I got that other one. The other version that goes on, it's got like about 18 courses. I don't want to, I don't want to punch you around and dig that up. I'm not going to get tired. Gosh, why does we have it? Oh, it's really good. Now to me, I even correct me if I'm wrong. Well, one of the most underrated deaths. I mean, Marlon Brando was certainly one and also Carol O'Connor. When they died, the earth should still, for at least a few days. Aren't you sick? Okay, sure. I mean, I make sure most people even know that Carol O'Connor's dead. Probably not. And what do you think about a guy named Carol anyway? And you knew where you were. And I was with those of them, one man. One thing talked about a band career move. Well, I'm sure he wasn't hurt from money by the time he croaked. But that in the heat of the night, the TV series, the movie was good with Rod Stager. Remember the movie in the TV series? Rod Stager was, he's also dead. It said he was dead. He was dead. He said he was dead too. No. Well, why do you say it like that? You said, well, I can like a wife. No. Well, I mean, don't get all emotional about this. We could use the band, I joined the group, I rocked in. Didn't we know what was the stage? We could have been on the boat as white. She'd our whole glass now in great old way. Now, seriously, and that's in second place. It's very close. And number one, they're holding this. What was that? They did. Well, I dialed it too fast. So that's why even a right cut. It's, oh, I'm on a wrong disk again. I don't want to hear funds in a live. Please, please, cracker, please. Don't do that to me. No more years. What is it I'm looking for? I give a little mash. I'm looking for mash. Mash was hit a DD sharp. I got to find that again. This is my eye pot. This is so bland. Like you said, the press has to go down. Mash potatoes, gravy, a little Richard, and all that stuff. A little Richard, you're fair. He found God, though. Man, he found religion. He's one of the ex-kids now. He's used to make love. He's written a big yellow. Sometimes he met on the street when they straighted up. When it down, most people know. He's a great man. And let me just point this out to you. If you look at that poor result right now, Chris, because I know you're very much in these numbers and stuff, or at least I pretend you are to give you kind of like an identity. One, three, two, four. I have one, three, two, six. I have one, three, two, six. You're such an ass. Well, like most said, although he said the whole word. One, three, two, four. And now you say 1326. Well, I'm going to click that view current thing on Ernst's 1326. So what are we thinking? We're going to have 1,400 by the top by noon. Oh, yeah. I think we're going for 16 today, man. 1,600. And in the modern era of this show, the idea. And I'm going to start at a month ago or whatever. We'll be doing it on some of these folks with people loaded 400 times. Who cares? 1,600 with that. Even eventually even George will be impressed by that. Watch Bugs and Bots and Biking. Hello, this is Albert Kider from Tony Banner Records, providing you American infidel to buy latest catch-seekings collection. You know my home, it is right. Let's take your head off your body. Got a machete with the real sharp blade. How I wish I had an American hostage. Make those in there. Oh, he's only shooting discraths. I was on the airplane. And suddenly with D-tain. There's a man who's out in the bird. And where's Alhamdah. I'm all in there. I'm in followed by an M-16. But do they one with? But what do you think about me, a purchase does not go to fund terrorism? Really? It's not time to get off the plane. Just relax and take it easy. The others down. That's your fault. It wouldn't have been a fire, would you? Find our skin and a rag. If you won't, a detainee. Another variation of the classic, woo! I ask myself every day, which Americans should take, tell me who it would know how it's saying. I'm gonna share it for a moment. I'm coming through the neck of a woman. All right. She lives there, veil and exporters. So, by Luke Hatch, she was collecting her table in 1995. All you can play with these are Mexican or weapons of mass destruction. That's a bad news for all you asked an offense that their wally-sur-Rai is dead. He was 84. He was one of the original seven Mercury astronauts. Oh. Let's hear Big Harah for wally-sur-Rai. But he's dead. Well, he's already resting piece. Rest in peace, and the sentence answers up there to that big space shuttle in the sky or whatever. 1334 on a pole. And while you think I'm stretching a little bit, well, of course, I'm 1250. Let's shoot for 1250, if we can get to 13, then, then. And I say 1550. The 1250 was yesterday, wasn't it? You okay with it? I don't know. Too many numbers, okay. Too many numbers. Too many spins of the machine boy. How did I ever come out of there with my pantalunies on yesterday? That was just what a comeback. When you make a big comeback, when you lose in your ass, I mean, when you are really having a really bad day again. And all of a sudden, by a bing, by a boom, by a bob, whatever. And you come out even a little bit ahead. I didn't bet you're a lot of money that I wasn't going to win yesterday. Robert's year writes 10th treachery. You know, Bob Robert's year writes for the nation. It wasn't good enough at the LA Times because he was a little bit too liberal. Tests treachery, he says the three short sentences at the beginning of chapter 17, a former CIA director George Tenet's memoir, at the center of the storm, tell it all. The United States did not go to war in Iraq solely because of WMD. I doubt it was even the principal cause yet. It was the public face that was put on it. Consider the deep cynicism of that statement, saying it does on the greatest threat to humanity's survival. And a pac-a-liptic nuclear configuration to explore the fierce of a nation raw from the 9th-level attacks. And a pac-a-liptic nuclear configuration, boy. The mushroom cloud over Manhattan that now Secretary of State Condoleezzo, why is in Vice President's dictatorship warning against, was nothing more than a cheap rhetorical trick. They're just to find a agenda of imperial intervention in the Middle East that the long-preceded 9th-level attacks. The goal was to ban Boosil Americans at his supporting the restructuring of the politics and Middle East to accord with the fantasies of a small band of neoconservative roles who would insinuated themselves into the highest levels of US government. Then they were roles was known to the chief of the CIA, and man we were awarded by President Boosil with the Medal of Freedom. Precisely because he provided respectable cover for the Chicanery that drove the Iraq to buckle, pity that it took a $4 million book contract for tenant to come clean. While tenant remains silently of serve the neocon, Kooted Top, close, his most devastating revelation, the annex of that neocon cabal in the Pentagon, and its Hitzkwad dubbed Team Fight for Douglas Fife, a protege of former deputy secretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz, and through him former secretary of defense, Dhamma Rosville and Chany. Team fights may entest with to create and maintain the fiction of a connection between Saddam Hussein and Muslim have been ladden when else all of it in support of better assertion. The intelligence unit fight headed set about discrediting the conclusions of every other intelligence operation while cherry-picking evidence to support the invasion of Iraq as a logical response to 911. Tenant's high crime and is just dead was that he knew of this treachery from the start he had never exposed into Congress or to the public. Take tenant's description of the briefing provided by Fife's office to offer the higher reaches of government entitled Iraq and Al Qaeda, making the case. As tenant notes, Fife's briefer, Tina Shelton, started out by saying that there should be no more debate on the Iraq out kind of relationship. It's an open and truck case you said, no further analysis is required. This statement instantly got my attention. I knew we had trouble in our hands. Say, tenant. Shelton ran through a series of fraudulent claims of fooding one that lead to hijack or Muhammad Ata had met with Iraqi agent in Prague, which the CIA had previously investigated, but found to be fraudulent, never happened. Tenant then adds, I listened for a few more minutes trying to be polite before saying, that's very interesting. This was one of my rare moments of trying to be subtle, but I was really thinking was this is complete crap and I want this to end right now. How do you like that? That's what he was thinking. We didn't say it's complete crap. That's right. But he didn't say it and the complete crap of team Fife carried the day with a bush administration from bush on down, not because they had the factor logic on their side, but because the intellectual bullying served the political agenda of the Carl Roe of Juggernaut. The bullying was effective only because Congress and the media were traumatized by 911, and because those who knew better, most prominently failed to speak out. In the end, tend to be trade, the bedrock freedom represented democracy, the right of the people to be informed and failed when it mattered most, is sworn duty to honestly inform the government about issues of vital importance to its security. Tenant knowing the administration was willfully leading our nation into a horrific war and a rack that would be tracked from the real fight against terrorism, had an obligation to resign and go public with his knowledge when the war could have been prevented. Tenant knew that the Bush administration had sold the public a package of lies, but he waited to reveal that truth until he could turn a hefty book profit. Will Tenant share the book royals with the grieving families of the dead and wounded from this war that he can see he could never honestly justify, or would the US taxpayers who are stuck with a trillion dollar bill for the never ending occupation and reconstruction of a rack? After one of his top show appearances will be arrested for complicity in war crimes? We can only hope. That's what Bobby Scheer says in the nation. Your buddy Robert Scheer tells it like it is, and that's so why he got candid TLA times. He tells him most truth. There he is. There is a Wally Sharai 84. Well he looked pretty old too. Why is 84? What do what I'm going to look like when I'm 84? I know you got a lot of lines for that probably mostly in a box and all is there? I don't know his to me. I think you're going to live to be 100. Yeah, right. Just out of the screen. That's why I'm a miserable old-proverted bastard in the crowd of it. For 1345 on the pool, what's your favorite theme song from a TV sitcom? And Nash is still eating, oh god, almighty. What are we going to do about that? It's such a, what is good about that? Can you tell me? I mean they like it so much. I don't know. But that's not the question. I'm talking about suicide for Christ's sake. It is? Yeah. That's the instrumental version of a song called suicide is painless. Which was in the movie match. That's where they got it from. Well, maybe we have a lot of suicidal people out there as possible. They're in South Florida after all, most of them. Nash 164 all in the family, 156, I just can't put all in a family over the top. Maybe because Carol O'Connor still did. Or maybe they just are nervous about a guy named Carol. Welcome back, hotter, 123, which really sucks. The reason that this pool is getting very disturbing to me. Aren't you disturbed? Yeah. WKRP, WCRAP in Cincinnati 1111, Sanford in San 110, 110. The Jefferson's 1007, good times 79. See in South Florida they'd rather be voting for a show name bad times. Not good times. Who wants good times in Florida? I think it's illegal in it. I think you're former your fat ass governor. That was the last thing he made it illegal to have good times in Florida. Fat ass, Jim. Except his family though they can party in the snort coke and screw their girlfriends in a parking lot and stuff like that. But anybody else, no good times. That was the last edict speaking of all in the family. Last edict of your fat ass governor. Barney, 161, happy days 59, taxi 51. The Murray-Tarla Moore show a 36 with that drunk, what's his name?

yesterday and trying to find the solution will come back in june in junio the news come admittedly disappointed governor by surprise and troublesome property owners in real estate agents hoping for a clear tax relief plan from a legislature that made property taxes dominate to four session but how to speak early lovely marco rubio who once said it would be a failure if legislative finish the session friday without a meaningful tax cut refused to back off a plan that calls for a steep savings by eliminating all-humour property taxes and favor raising sales tax we could have probably passed something yesterday would cut your taxes eighteen bucks a year rubio said labeling such a plan that's howl has these special a phony reform eighteen bucks my ass the west-manly legislator in his counterpart said it present again prude we don't want to do it said they were close to an agreement but didn't want to be rushed they agreed to meet you in profit upon twenty two promising to approve a constitutional amendment for voters this fall that would help guarantee savings for all taxpayers but the major ideological riff will still be there in june in junio rubio wants to fundamentally change the tax structure prude and christ want to maintain the basic structure but rollback the amount of local governments contacts prude initiative the uh... initiative the corporate special session and he found rubio and the governor my beloved clock is to the more insane there was too little time left to create a responsible and well understood plan in other words but about a bit but a bit

I promise. I promise. Whenever the laws of any state are broken, a duly authorized organization swings into action. I'm right. It may be called the state police, state troopers, Malisha, the Rangers, or the Highway Patrol. Now, these are the stories of the man who's training skill and courage. I've enforced and preserved our state law. Wow. How are you? Here's the facts from Rick and West Palm Beach. Any chance you have the wikiting things on, not sure. Don't. We can't. I can never put that on here now. They could give you a little wiki, but they sure couldn't give you a little. And anyway. I'm not a wiki. I told you, this is a true story. You'd have to send in the box top from some serial or something like that and you're an animated rest. And it would send you back this plastic sheet of plastic that was covered that you put on the screen. This is a long before a color TV. And the top was blue like the sky. And the middle was pink, supposedly like flesh color. And the bottom was green like the grass. You did tell us that before. Yeah. And you'd put it over the screen. And then you had these crayons. You would like do stuff on it and crack like that. Anyway, it was a real show wiki. Then can you would Jackbury. He's dead. Didn't John Sebastian from Love and Swimful do the thing from welcome back. Carter. And is he dead? Yes. No. Oh, I don't think so. That's right. That's right. He's still dead. Okay. Relax. This is how our daily got a new curly wik. Now they call me an happy headed mole. Good. Thanks Rick. That's like that. Nappy headed mole. Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't. Right. Where's that key change again when I need it? Okay. Let me take a look and see if we got any shot. Let's do it. Okay. I don't want to be embarrassed and humiliated. Here. I don't want to go out like a clown. Like Howard Beal said. 1522. We need 78 votes in 37 minutes. And it's going to be a tall order. You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. Like if you ordered a bunch of flat jacks. 600 of them tall order. 1524 still. 76 votes. 37 minutes. That's more than two a minute. Just barely more though. Just barely mole. What do you think? I mean if you if we'd start getting them chunks like we did there for a second. See it still stuck on 1524. Then they're going to do it. Now they just not going to come through for us today. Damn it. 2010 these people. A lot of money. They've come through every other time in history. I do believe. I don't think we're going to. There is one day a long time ago we fell short. Right at the end of the show. We just came up a little bit show. Yeah. Of course I've been doing that a long time. So, don't be shook by your CCC motion let's go back up. If not, you'll give it a翻 wake up. So, don't be shook by your AC on the Trend again. Okay. So, the Distab erro. Outsfield tomorrow. So, Afterwards, you will. We will normally start with this. Our Chicos cars are taken from the Top 10,au$197. He's busy. This is the doctor'smind. Are you going to tell this, tady I'll tell you a bit about the street. There will be a chance to make sure this Tampa vehicles are going to get in chess polar bridges under theenklan. And then on usually strongly, we're the editorial, the surveyatory of Romano, the surveyatory of Romano. She's very easy to say it, and I just make it confused, but it's got like a thing in there. The surveyatory of Romano said a present presenter of a televised media rock concert, which is sponsored by Alis Labrionians has launched Violet Tax on ProBedinic in front of an excitable crowd. Oh, they're getting excited, as those Catholics tend to do. They get excited, and then they reproduce like crazy, which the Pope is very happy about. This, too, is terrible, and he likes to watch. This, too, is terrorism. It's terrorism belongs to tax on the church, it's it. It's terrorism, this stoke blind, an irrational rage against someone who always speaks in the name of love, love for life and love for man. Oh, I bet he's got love for man. Me, too. Certain men. At the concert held a beer for you from the Saint John in Latter-in-Basilica, Rome's Cathedral where Pope Benedict sits his bishop. One of the presenters, Andrea Rivera spoke out against the pot of stand on number of issues. The Pope says he doesn't believe in evolution. I agree, in fact, the church has never evolved. He said, excellent line, Andrea. He also quit a sign, and what's happening for a guy is Andrea. He also could have signed the church for refusing the Eurekaflik funeral to pure George Eau wellbeing. A man who can't paint for youth in Asia's elite paralyzed with muscular vissteffy, he died in December after Dr. Greedu unplug his respirator. He unplug, he pulled a plug. I can't stand the fact that the Vatican refused to funeral for wellbeing, but that wasn't the case for Chile and dictator Augusto Pinnichet, or Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. We said, between music and laughter, you open air concert. Good, you go, Andrea. So he's kind of Andrea but Chile. There's another guy named Andrea. Yeah, I think Andrea would tell me. Well, maybe Andrea didn't see the way they struggled. Now it was very, very, very bad taste. It was tasteless. Like this, you always tasteless. Like for no ice cream. No more ice cream, man. You know something I didn't know problem. I have no problem right now. With that, anyway. 1530 votes, we need 70 votes, and 34 minutes. You can do it if you put your anose to it. Call her for follows. Still sucks. Ow! Good bye. Scooter, living, living, living, living, living, living, living. You out and secret egg and send a feel, then God will kill. Like the King of the Oradrises and his food. Can't pick your boyfriend in the truth. Looks like it's time for Smithy. I'd like to ask working under him. Run your vantage point. Does Jamie have a mole on his hand? That's good. Here we go again. I never will be a flanander. Always find a finger. And we'll never know how many agents died because of your gift. Ow! With love, no back and throw. Who will join? You, who. When you see yourself at Jamie, you could ask him why. His name. Rimes with ad. He's a new. 132 at 56, he WPM had gone up from 2 to 5. No Humper today. He's in a Louisville for the Derby Day. John's all joined us at 11 on the phone tomorrow. And we'll do our usual losing Derby picks. And then tomorrow morning, you attend. We got the ratings, baby. The winner book. Oh, that bonus money. You can smell it. It smells like good by me yesterday. Why didn't you just get out and move? Run away, Neil. Run away. 1543. This is going to be tighter than a which is your low man. This is going to be really tense. You think they can do it? We need 57 votes in 29 and 20 minutes. We got it. Get out of here. We got it. My ass. Well, where do you come up with such nonsense? 1543. I just clicked that view current baby on here again. And it's not moving a tick. No chunk. No lump. Look at I'm is again around CNN. Seriously. He looks like somebody from the petrified forest. He, like I, like, I've ever hung him with their man. It's here for a long time. Little that I realized how he's like a writer of how salt. How spot on I was. I keep clicking this thing. I don't see no chunk. The chunk on my lip. I think it came out of my left nostril. 1543. I think maybe we maxed out. They're letting us down. It's never, ever happens. Usually you can go look at that. Are you, are you, are you anything more now? No. I don't have anything less either. Oh, I was sad. What do you got Chris? 1544. 1544. There's one. Now, if that rate, we might make 1550. Now, we will now you will agree with me. We will go beyond 1550, right? Yeah, definitely. Although with this rate, I think 1550, maybe what they have in mind. We need 56 votes in 27 minutes. It's still like two a minute. Just a minute. Just a minute. 1545. There you go. There's somebody alive out there. 1545. 55 and 27. That's two a minute. Do the math. Maybe 54. 55. I mean, this is a prestige kind of a thing. It's an ego thing. That's that we have any ego on. It sure is. I sure is. Although it would be nice to see them come true like with flying colors. When we really extend the hand of the gland of friendship and say, come on. Get off your ass and hop on here. 1600. On the 1546. See what I'm saying? They're trickling in. Just a little bit of a trickle. WQAM. Hello. Yes. William Conrad did the narration for the bowling go show. And well as as well as a heavy or cop and or cop in the killers with Bert Lancaster. He was not doing on the radio and gun smoke. Right. That was that was oilier. I'm talking about the car going going rocky. Rocky and the walk the rocky and bowling goes so. Who's that to creature? That's for. What was that? Like in bowling. But it starts with that. 51 we need in 27 minutes. Oh, oh. In fact, I simply cut that. We've cut the racial down over the Hamiltonian. The racial down. 1560. WMR Marshall Michigan. I worked there. So long gone here. I worked in some stations. You're no longer on here. But that's the end radio. Maybe it's because I had less of the curse. Maybe it was the curse of old Neil or the curse of young Neil. 1560. Oh, no, it's 1550. 1550. 1550. I mean, we're not going to make it. Although we have 25 we need 50 votes in 25 minutes. It's exactly. Do the math or not even you can do it. What? You heard me. 1550. 1550. I don't know. I'll say it now. Maybe WCK. Well, I didn't sense an ante. Back in the day when you're AM radio at night time, especially at all these booming 50,000 odd signals coming in from all across the country. And you're radio is like your friend. Not today, you know, like your enemy. Back then it was like your friend. 32 AM hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Good. I'm on my way to American Express. Thank you. Okay. Let's go when you get there. It's right next to the Spanish steps. QAM hello. Hello. Hello. WQAM hello. You say everything's been blamed. Good. WQAM hello. I am. Yes. Have a shame. If you're glad, can I can agree with your request? First time you're calling, you're calling to ask for something. This is big too. I got a friend of mine told me about a bit that you play a call. It calls you up and you tell him something about these gay or something like that. Oh, yeah. And that call. Yes. It's first call. Today is first call. I do believe it's matter. Now maybe second. There was the one about the gay two gay guys talking about women. 15. 56. 24 minutes. 44 votes. You see how their ratio is coming. They're going to bring us right to the end there. And 15. 57. 43 votes in 24 minutes. You're almost saying that this was important when you. Almost the way I get all melodramatic about this and put on the big push. Yeah, like I really care something like that. I do care today. Not ordinarily. I don't. But today I just. I'm. I'm. Do you sure touch it? It's. With Robert Stack, why sure Miss Robert Stack don't you? And that trench coat. Mm hmm. She put on the bed. The fugitive. He got a fugitive. Who was in the fugitive? Richard Diamond. Okay. Richard Diamond. No. I forget his name. I mean they're not even a guy named that. That's not Richard Johnson. Richard Johnson. Richard Johnson. I think that was his name. Come on. Look it up. Yeah. Google it. I think you're. Who's Richard Diamond? I've never heard of him in my life. I think you know Dick Diamond. Let's see. The tight rope, Mr. Lucky Bourbon Street beat Peacellis, Blues, Asphalt, Jungle. Mr. Broadway. I never heard of most of his show. Yeah. And they could chance. And maybe. Richard Johnson. And what do I say was? Diamond. I think that was his name on the show. And some show he was in. The French chef. The French chef. Now with watching him who died. See the child. How the child that he. Oh, hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry. David Janceen. Where are we, Cooper. And what do you call that. Well, the narrator. 7 Jaden Lagerick. Christ. You're getting fatal. You're on cannon, comrade. David Jansen. Where are we? Three. And why? You're on cannon, cant-for. Are we. Turn around. Your. This. Well. That? Do you know. You. The. Or? On same this. Causes. play the whole thing. Like I said, we're not going to get to your George Fennelman, and that's really a shame. And they used to, I don't know whether he used to smoke on actual course for our show. We had the cigar he was puffed on, smoking on TV was very common back in the day. Not only they have cigarette commercials, but there are a lot of people who used to change smoke on ear. I'm trying to think of who some of them used to be, but I mean, this is smoke like crazy on ear. And that's kind of shock you now. No. Because I really think. Well they're not smoking what you are. 1562, let's see. What do you think Chris? 1565, this little chunk right there, 35 votes short, and we need to have 21 minutes. We got it. I think this audience is going to come through for us. And when they do man, it's going to be a spectacular moment. It's going to be like a radio orgasm. And man, it's going to be just phenomenal. You'll see. Holy makin' on. This is Joe Bow on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs. And you're listening to the hockey authority, Neil God. Well, it gets a would be nicer. Too test-peak clean for one day, but I don't want a good day without a tranquil feel. I take a daily dose twice. I'll share it in sweet sweet sweet. Don't want to be discovered me. So as you win my head like a pillow, I want to see when we'll all know when I've had it. You man, they said I especially win my face in the floor. Oh, why might we sometimes long from Trump's deep ocean? Can I get a man who's maybe in my physical body? Oh, I got to stay date. You're fairie. I got to stay date. You're fairie. Oh, I got to stay date. You're fairie. I got to stay date. To date. Okay, shake it and bake it. Maybe 1-45. Fifty minutes to go and we need 27 votes by what I'm seeing on here at a 1573-1575. Wow, there's I'm a second. Seriously, if you don't look at 145, this stuff that they're showing on CNN, he should have just been fired for being an old cout. I mean, I don't see anything while we're napping head of the hose. No problem with that, but just him, although he was making him a lot of money, that's the thing that I just don't get it, because it's just our whole business. They'll put you on if you're like a, you know, if you are dead, if they think it could sell a show, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if they got the orages show on after I croaked. No problem. You're dying on Monday? I'm begging for him. Didn't you die in Monday from? Let's not go back in there. Okay, we got to keep it straight now. But they'll they'll put it back. Yeah. Fifteen, 78, 22 votes in 14 minutes. So that's not even two a minute. I think we're going to come right down to the line. I think we're going to do it. Oh, man. A lot of people out there, especially if you haven't been listening a long time. You're thinking, what is this man getting all whipped up about votes on some stupid internet pool? Why is he all what? Because I can. Some are shining and say beautiful day man. So good to be in here. I'm leaving now. Let's see what they is. It Thursday. We got Thursday. We got tomorrow Friday, which tomorrow tomorrow is going to be an easy show. Well, it's going to be a, maybe not because the ratings come out. Right. The bad tomorrow 10 a.m. Oh, whoa. As Eric would say, is Eric still saying that? Whoa. I don't talk to my Eric. I was talking to yesterday. He went. Chris was talking to me yesterday. What did he say? What were you talking about? He was showing you how to set up trillion for the, uh, in show chat room thing. Are you hurting? Oh, he was giving some computer ass systems. Yeah, that. 1579, 21 votes in 13 minutes. You can do it. You can really do it. In fact, we really need them to do it a little faster than that. Because I can interrupt, you know, over the last or whatever we do, I'll just, you know, I'll keep you. The last break coming at 53 or whatever. 1583. Now, everybody poo pooed me. Chris said, oh, you're crazy. Fick on you. Is that what you said? You were just making fun of me at George Vows. That you were making fun of me. You were mocking the old queen a little bit. Yeah. It wasn't a George. It was mocking the old bird. Maki, he said, you're a maki. And I said, hey, don't know this antisemitic craft. You go ahead, your bastard. That's one thing about Chris. He's just, you know, he's oblivious to that stuff. Whatever that means, 1584, 16 boats and 13 minutes. That's really more than one minute, 1585. Maybe now they're coming through. They're playing that game. They like to play with my emotions. You haven't any idea what I'm talking about? Neither do I. 14 more. We got 1586. Well, I'm telling you, this will be one of the, I'm going to have them write this on my tombstone. I'll restart it to pull one about five weeks ago or something. That's not that big of a deal. Oh, he's an Andy. Can we actually play this? Yeah, we got to say that on the earlier one. We thought about it. No. Pay me a saying this. When I throw a can say, he and I'm sorry. I haven't passed on our show, baby. And by the way, your postperson is ready to break from that. I'm just sick. I guess today came out of a sick way. The mail doesn't pack anything. He's very welcome. I'm not just a specialist in that, but I made sure that I did it because they didn't really tell you why. I felt like hell, but I had to come down to this area of town anyway. So I did that. Well, I know pretend that you came in just for a moment. Just for no other reason. I got out of that. I just so I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. Oh, here's my favorite. Oh, this is good. When you get to be an old fart like me, you want to watch a lot. It's a well. You and my mom. Here we go. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Wonderful. Wonderful. Oh, you don't have something to stand free of your. If if chicken egg were if anybody may be brand and somebody can find me that recording. Wonderful. Wonderful by stand free of your own capital records. It was a take off on Lawrence. Well, it was it was pretty. It was me. I was. It was. It was. Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful. Lawrence, a mile. He's still there. The lemon. So, 15. 90. Baby, we are going to do it. Oh. Wow. And you get really old. You listen to Lawrence a while. Can you watch. So, you're still playing that kind of TV. There's a lot of love for the budget going. Yes. You know, it's not boring. It's for the essence because you're never going to get to it. Although it's just I took it again. It's still 15. 90. Don't leave us short. Right at the end. Oh, no. 15. 91. Marit. Fine. Oh, and I had that guy's room. But, but that's a deep voice. What was his name? Lawrence. Well, remember when I'm talking about the real deep voice. Larry something. Yeah. Larry. And I hated that show. There's James Browns. Live at the moment. They dug his ass up against James Brown. 14. 19. 62. Far one. Legendary of Hollow Feeer. That's way June 1st and 2nd. I should mention it. No, it's not 1st and 2nd. It's 14th and 15th. The funk brothers and Mary Wilson. The falls of you casino Niagara Falls. I just mentioned that because I know that everybody knows is obsessed. Like we are with that movie with that soundtrack. And with the other brothers. And they ought to be. And of course, who knows if they'll go and see him. 1594, we need just six votes in two minutes. And the reason I say two minutes, I want to get this nail down before we go into the last break. I mean, James Brown, the compare him to the Motown artist, it's just to me. It's just ridiculous. I mean, I don't know. I just didn't care for his crack. He was just a screamer in more ways than one. 1594, come on. We need those six votes. Let's get with it. Hop on it. I think we're pushing the envelope here today in terms of the audience. I mean, not that we don't have the crowd that we used to have, George. But 1595, there's another one. What do you got? Because you might think it. Huh? But I could click it just like you, but you know, but it still comes up to seems stupid as right. Well, pretend six, 96, 1596, we need full motors. How sharp them. See, they're talking about James Brown and right way they put out sharp enough. Now, can't they put out sharp enough? I'm talking about some white gives and don't I miss? Because how sharpens one of the worst black races ever. You ought to hear his radio show. They'll think it. In fact, I think his favorite song is Hunky Tone. Oh, you better watch yourself. How sharpens monitoring you. Yeah. Monitor this now. You far-bissing. So tenderly professional ethnic man. Everything is a racial issue. I feel sorry for I'm, you know, when you get to be old and gay, gray. I don't. Doesn't he have a lot of money? Yeah, I don't feel sorry for him at all. Anybody that's milked that he used to be good man. 100 years ago. He's all he is. You would have loved him, man. Really saw Reverend Billy Saw Hargis. He was a Reverend. He was anti-religion. Anti-religion. Religious fakers. You know, we need four more hosts and they're not doing it now. And what do you got? This came 1997. Fifty ninety seven. We need three more votes. And then we can go.
