Oh yes today was a glorious day. Was it? Yes. Was that? How did a good day? How good. Not me. What happened to you yesterday? How did a good day Saturday and get most of it back yesterday? Oh. Yeah, I didn't even know. I'm sure in the coma position. Yeah. Not good, my sheen's mine. So what you go is you want to take a rest from that crap for a while. I'm pretty burned out on it. It's boring. I don't know, but I mean you're getting ready to go away anyway. A couple of weeks not soon enough. Your board clearance stuff in our studio this morning. We don't want them in there. Go away, Clarence. Deal with the sports issues. Okay. Deal with your little playground buddies. He's barred. He is barred from our studio. Anyway, they're having a nervous breakdown about Ricky Williams here, man. They're all whipped up in a friend's youth. I think that this was Jesus on skates. Man. That is making a lot of sense. That's a lot of articles. I'm trying to start this morning. I'm just a couple of paragraphs to give an idea of how emotionally I'm talking about. He touched his palms. He was shoot tops like it was no tour. He touched his head. He was knee in the effortless hurtlers pose. And for the peace to resist. Williams real off a series of running high kicks. There were straight leg of the end stunning. A little more aggressive and impressive than the similar work of his teammate. He looked like Bruce Lee among the Rockets. When the club's brain trust introduced him on Sunday, they built it as a running bagged. They're sure of Messianic. Calling him a role model for the young populace and a servant of civilisation. He's special enough that he might be the only professional athlete on our small planet who is sworn off the cell phone. Williams who also revealed that he'll find time and his kids will teach yoga during his tour of tenure. Said yesterday he hadn't heard from many of his teammates on the dolphins because they have to wave contact. I mean, we don't have a cell phone. I guess it's against his. Well, there's something for you to do. You can sign up for yoga. Oh, there you go. It's supposed to be a yoga. You know what yoga said. And they over till it's over. It's like me and clearance. Our relationship is over. By the way, the water not sees leaving today. Got a breathless email from your general manager yesterday. Well, I'm sitting at wood vine. Oh, tomorrow's fill is his last day. You could do a whole show. After I called him and just rarld for 50 minutes on a Friday afternoon about all kinds of things and he'd but a beat. But it would. So his responses descend me and email that the water not sees leaving. Well, they went ahead and did it yesterday. What's that? They went ahead and did that remote yesterday. Oh, I know that. Oh, he didn't know anything about that by the way. Yeah, they went ahead and did it because we told him to do it. So the George and Josh could get off a couple hours early. I mean, what a week here. We don't have a regular line up anyway. And then, of course, I see all week long. Oh, my god. The human cold sore between two and four. Wow. That is scary. Human coats. Yeah. The human chankered. Oh, it's great. The chankered rhymes with anchor. I saw about the last minute to Charlie Gibson on ABC News last night. Boy. They are dreaming. Another old-futty dirty with the tiny mouth and wrinkled up for a lift's strange guy. He was pretty good. He was a fixture on Good Morning America. Well, who now watches that? Who watches those morning shows anyway, much as silly as housewives? Same people that watch Oprah. Watch that crap. God. See, they keep saying, well, you know, America, the people who watch the news, even the young people, which they're none of them watch said news anyway. But assuming that they did, they watch their news from an older person. They don't realize that we're older. Crunk had one on here. He was young guy. People like Ralph Ridenay, people watched him for 30 years on here. He didn't start out as a. Dabbling old fart, you know, just like us when we went on here. We didn't start out as 80 year old old fart, so with a walker in a classroom he bag, right? Right. And people grow up with him. He stick with him because people like consistency, which this day's not about you. They trust you. That's right. They like crunk tight. Huddly and frequently they stare out there. We young guys and people watch them for 20 years and then be. The news people build a trust for. Right. And then they're talking about Bob Sheeper while CBS's numbers are one of the they talking about. And if you ever watch him, my god. He's guy. I think he's got Andy Rune's eyebrows growing out of his hair out of his ears. Man. We'll talk about an old toad. People don't want to watch grandpa fumbling his way through the news and to say an hokey, hokey, dokey things on here. Nobody wants to see that. But nevertheless, I'm going to stick with Brian Wiggum, even though I can't stand looking at him. He's a guy. He's got like two sets of bottom teeth and his head is like, he looks like he was in that movie. What the hell was that movie about the Spacier planning? Oh, so many of them. Yeah. Something of a third kind or whatever. Yeah. No. Boston counters. No. That was that movie with Richard Dreyfus. That was about Spacier planning. Yeah. I know. Can't stand him either. Go back in the art and keep digging Richard. Dig a deep hole and jump into it. It was to make up a list of people I don't want to hear about any more ricky would be right there. Really? Who cares? Well, here will be back though. He'll be back. I don't care. Only here for one year. You know, it could. As if there was any doubt that can even football because of joke. The fact that they don't recognize, they don't respect the rules of the NFL players that are barred or suspended. They don't recognize that so they can play in the CFL. It's a joke. It makes a mockery of it. And the worst line ball in the world and as long as they can hopefully draw few extra asses in the seats. That's what they'll do. And by the way, speaking of asses in the seats, they announced 7,683 yesterday for the Giants at PPP Park. Norma Kent called me from the ballpark and you said to a more people in the right field stands than where we had home playing. There were like 3,000 people there. There was a lot that there was there. And the fact is that he had some nerve to hit that home run on Sunday. So it took whatever significant sort of amount of bit about him being in town away. So who cared? I thought it was great. Good. Nice going Barry. You jack-a. Now I like them just for that. Boy, you. I'm telling you that David Samson's got a good point, man. You're responsible for the fact that Fadeur of this franchise. Yeah, right. Not the fact that they got a bunch of little leaders out there. That's nothing to do with David. It's your fault. Yeah. Hank, I can just see the headline now. Hank Chase's Marlins out of Miami. That'll be the headline of Barry's column. Yeah, I could have the payroll down about the same man. Well, pass over where they're going. The day they need for you to even New York. Did I baseball team in Geneva? Yeah. They got a baseball team in the TV. I don't know if there's still there. The TV of pirates actually broadcast a couple of the TV of pirates ball games. And WBT and Batavia in 1963. Can you believe that? I like that. And Gene Baker was the manager, I believe. I remember Gene Baker. Yeah, that's the second basement I've got. Yeah, I like that. What a memory. I think he was second based. Boy, that was a long time ago. Yeah. What I was before Gene's was an infant. Was Dick wrote the short stop then. Now, Dick wrote, let's see, Maserowski was the second based on one great with short stop. And Don Hope was a third and Dick Stewart was continuing with Rocky Nelson at first. You know what show they show on trying to think of what's channel it is. Just one moment plays out today. It's the classic classic ESPN. Well, yeah, you've, you know, your ESPN guy. He's a classic channel and they show the old home run Derby shows. You ever watched those? I used to remember you when I'm talking about. Yeah. That was the corny show. Yeah. There was no crowd around doing it. It was bogus analysis it enough there. And it's Dick Stewart against Richie Allen. You know, whoever the hell it was. And they did it. I think they did it at some ballpark and Florida. Did they? Yeah. Well, let's find out where that one is. Maybe the Marlins can play there. Yeah. Dick Stewart. Well, I haven't thought about him. He was on it this weekend. That's why it came to mind. He kept it in round balls. Dr. Strange Glove. I don't think he's with us anymore. Is he dead? I know Don Hope had a little problem there. Yeah. And Tom's who close to us had. Oops. I was like Don Hope. And how about Richie Hebner? Did he die? I hope not. I don't know. Do you know that he, um, he was an undertaker. Not a undertaker, but he worked in a cemetery. As a kid, Richie Hebner. I'm a Richie Hebner? Sure. Somewhere in here. Oh, well, wouldn't if he's something if I had that Bob Prince thing in here? Do we have that in there, George? Which one? The Bob Prince thing. It would be under Bob Prince. No. Space would be under Baseball. Oh, geez. Wouldn't that be a shame if I don't have that? I know it's in here somewhere, but I'm not going to find it. What is Shane? No. No. No. We don't have it. Or I don't have it on the baseball. Huh? I don't know to look under. Oh boy. That's the Shane. Found Barney Taser down. I'm going to play that. Will we play the alpha year-laves? What's that one? Oh, my Madonna. Madonna. Farting up the storm. I'm going to play that. Better watch it. You're going to eat yourself. Joyce. The baseball fever. I can't find it. I'll find it. Maybe it's under Harry Kiri. I doubt it. Damn it. Anyway, Bob Prince and Richie Hebner home run against. And you know who the right fielder was for the giant set day? Very barn. Bobbie barns. Now, there was a player. Bobbie barns. He was in right field. I believe so. And you know, they showed the picture of a very barn. The sub-Bobbie barns played center. But whatever it held, where he was. Maybe it was in right center field of home run. But anyway, they showed the picture of very when he was with the pirates. Yeah. And he was around 150 pounds. And he was like a scrawny kid. He was like skinny. I just can't imagine how it would. Maybe he just ate a lot of pasta or something. Yeah, he was expecting, said, Rickie Williams was easy eating pasta. And I forgot, I two that article away. That just was reading you. Pasta in some kind of beans. He doesn't get the testered up there either. But the NFL will still test them. Yeah. 10 times a month. They'll be out of a system by the time he gets back down there. No, no, 10 times a month. He still has to go for tests. Oh, aye, does he really? Yeah. 10 times a month. It's one, every three days. Whatever. If my math is correct, Boy, how's he going to avoid that? What can weed up here, boy? Boy. you can smell it on the street quarters here. Well I think I smell some right now. Oh no. That's bad. That's bad. The little of contact ties. Yeah. Well he's going to be busy teaching you over, you know. Running high and jumping fast. Just like any blades or Brian blades, whichever one was, Brian blades. He don't have time to go to court. He's got a run fast and jump high. He's got football to worry about. So how about your heat man? Stop! Couldn't care less. No, we've talked about it enough today. Good. I'm sure I'm sure it's been. F***! Tilt. Talk about a one-note Charlie. Good God. All on the bandwagon man, it's what they wait for is what? What bandwagon can we jump on this week? They're hungry for a championship here. Oh yeah. And I'm going to tell you, for running phonies. In fact they had not the last game, but the game before that in Carolina. They had chunks of empty seats. That's your for running phonies in Rawling North Carolina. Those people wouldn't know a hockey puck from their ass. And then all of a sudden we loved a hurricane. All of the other crap. What a funny bunch of Bologna. And when they show the crowd there in North Carolina man, those people you talk about Mugwams, they look like distant presence of the band your boys, the beesleys. Wow. Strange. You ever seen them people in their house? Joe Bells from where? He worked in Rawling. Yeah. Wow, figures. I thought that was Christian's of working Rawling. So they worked together there. So otherwise he brought his buddy down there with him. That's what it's all about. I see. That's what people in everywhere in every business. That's what they tend to do. They comfort zone. They bring their own little personal mafia along with them. Hey, it's like Facebook managers. Yeah, they bring their own cultural law. All sports. Taki the same thing. So all their buddies with them. No one to get canned and they all pretty much get canned at the same time. Right. But there's a reason for it. I mean, no water vine. I think the reason in business is the same as it is in sports. Yeah. They want somebody to watch their back. Is that what it is? Yeah. Or is it just insecurity, the fact that they realize that they're inept in the company. Oh, you know, Craig Robinson, who I know a little bit, told me one time that when he got the magier's job in Cleveland, they would not allow him to hire his own coach or his own coach. Well, they throw their free to bring a bunch of black folks in there. Well, he wanted one guy. Just so he just wanted to hire one coach. Yeah. You know, a long time associative is. And the general manager wouldn't let him do it. I'm so glad you mentioned him because what was he crying about the ability? You see his preference after he hit you out. He pulled his catcher out. I know what happened. I showed the clips the catcher was throwing the ball into right center field. I mean, like 10 feet over the second baseman or short stuff said. And he pulled him out and he and the postgame press conference was crying. They won the game. They came back, Washington won the game eight to five. And he was in tears. The tears were running out of his cheeks because he pulled a guy out. Right. He didn't get that. He was upset because he thought he showed the guy up. Well, I got news for him. That's baseball is a whiskey game. A hockey. They pulled a gulio out like Carolina did. He was in the crying. That's no crying in baseball. But your wusses. He's kind of like, like that. Oh, God. I can't take that. He'll be on a two today, by the way. And then again tomorrow. And then again Thursday. And I believe that we're going to page. And then again Friday. We got to take whoever's available. That's what I was told on Friday. We got to put on whoever's available. So I guess nobody else is available. I'm thinking I might put in a two to four one day just to keep him off the year. Just stick around. Just to cut down the squeak pack. Oh, I just leave for a minute and then come back. Gotta be an improvement over. I can't talk about sports because I know nothing about that stuff. Now, we'll see. It's not this Saturday. It's a week from Saturday as the bell, right? Yes. Nobody cares. Could be tough pulling or rating on that one. Yeah. Well, good luck to you. You know what? It's not a bad race. Now, what do you even like Tuesday? Yeah. I think I'm going to work Thursday from New York. Really? Yeah. Wednesdays that you're on. Don't overdo it. Don't overdo it. Well, Friday I have shows to do. When in doubt lay out. I'll be working. No, you'll be working someplace else. Yeah. Where you getting paid and treated like a munch. Yep. That's good. What should I have to deal like that? Find a little extra moonlight. Maybe I'll go to work for CFRB. I was told a guy at our own set station here just loves me. I'm obsessed with me. So I heard 50,000 watts man CFRB. Home of the Brian McFarlane show. I think it's on 10, 10. Yeah. It's on the same frequency that wins in New York. Used to be. Yeah. See an upstate New York as a kid growing up. I used to like, see HUN was 10, 50 Toronto. And also WMGM which then became WHM. I think that's the station you're buddy. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, I didn't know that. Remember WMGM? And he's working there. Well, whatever it is. Pretty soon they'll be saying remember that station. Oh, no, that's bad. Well, remember WM? I just said that. WMGM because it's not the Peter Trip to curly had a kid in the third row. Was a top 40 station. Yeah. WMGM and WABC and WMCA. I don't have any WMGM jingles though. I gotta get maybe blind Michael give me some jingles from WMGM. And he went to jail Peter trip for payola. How come nobody ever offers us any payola? Have you offered any graph? Never. Me neither. Not a dime. What could we do for them? I don't know. I mean, the reason people... Well, back when we had an audience we might have been able to do something for. Maybe we have moved a little merchandise a little S off the shelf. Not anymore though. That's back in the day. And now that I got my iPod I realized that music radio forget about. That's all done. Bye-bye. Done. Anybody who listens to the radio for music is got to be a retard. Got to be an old foe in older than us. If that's possible. Because it is just done. I mean, now with MP3s and iPods and iPods and iPods and everything. Walkman's. I mean, why the hell, you know, you get all the music that you like. The iPod that I bought I can put 7500 songs on there. Now we got 600 on there so far. That's what I want to need radio for, right? Yeah. I'm going to write that down. I'm going to...one of these days. This before I croak I'm going to get back in the radio business. Well, doesn't have a great day. Did you sure I mean listening to the for the staff? No. Okay. I'll be taking a nap. So I know when you get up early in the morning. Sometimes you nap a little bit. Well, it's totally between two and four. Actually, I want to be in my work to do today. Yeah. Yeah. What? And the racing for him? No, I've got some interviews to tape. And now I had a very good day yesterday. I don't need to play the rest of the week. Good. Excellent. There you go. I'm glad to hear it. Wish I could say the same. At one of those days. Well, good for you. Yeah. See you tomorrow. Yep. The music stressed on the previous programs are those of the host, guests, and college. And you're not referred to those of the BC-Gripe test group. It's staffed, advertisers, things. Hey, Clarence, now to my studio. I'm Jack and she's a Queensland beauty. You're fair. Go to the BS name. Good night, Dan. Good. That was my dad. You're a professor of beautiful. Meal of American A-Holes. Real American A-Holes. We salute you. Mr. Guy, who still thinks Bush is doing a good job. Mr. Guy, Mr. Thanks, Bush. You come to work with us smile on your face. As you pay $3.78 a thousand cents a gallon. And adjust the plastic Jesus on your dashboard. Ha ha! I'm doing it now! Bush is approval ratings are at an all-time low. But you don't care. You're a red stator. And broke back Malcolm never played a fever near you. Don't want trouble either. There's no such thing as global warming. Those sinners in New Orleans cut but they deserve. And yes, the earth was created in seven days. You'll feel me that it's ever over the shelf. The war in Iraq is a noble fight. And by Gale, one day we'll find those nasty weapons of mass destruction. So we salute you. Mr. Guy, who still thinks Bush is doing a good job. You're a gas-custling SUV. You're two-point-two children and your ignorance. You are a re-American A-hole. Amen. 10.17 at 5.60WQ. I'm happy of day after Memorial Day. Tuesday may 30. Not 30 minutes.

Smogular, man. It's schmoggy. It is so hot and humid. You could barely. Of course you used to that every day. So I had to literally. Got my telling people that in Florida. 10.18 already. Almost ready for the second break. Hey, if you're a cigar smoke, we're going to kick back with a good premium brand. And then, he is cigars. By Tony Burhani is for you. He's hard to find cigars.

She's another potato who's not using a brain button. He's behind me, stay in alive. Same. If we don't get big, stay in alive. Same alive. Same alive. I wish that if there was day, not thinking I would die. From being able to think you're the devil. I should never eat this down on the floor. I think back on the track is right. My power. I don't know if I can help you do that. From the fact that Paul, you're that these bunch of doctors. Now my hot stuff. You're hooked upside down. So am I interested in Paul? I'm trying to think is there's something at the end of this that we got a little leaf on? No, you sure not. I should have known much to expect George said it. Did they get my eye on me? Which the pineapple said it's a gift for this town. I would like to meet you. Paul, well, if I can't meet that girl, I'll follow you. Why can't you let me so different? Why can't you lose you get it right? My power was blocked inside my heart. Can't make my turn to go. Just get that, just get that. I won't see you no more. In fact, this seems to be going around in that family. A lot of ill-fated families. You know the Kennedys. Right. And who else? What are their music groups? Oh, the parts of family. The Kennedys are dead. Why? I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about people who are like dead. Oh, Beach Boys. Oh, boy. The story. Don't see Dennis no more. Won't see Carl no more. Right. I came here and music. That was Carl. That was Carl. Brian Wilson still live, but it's hard to tell. Actually, Mike Love was the lead singer on most of those songs. You were that. I'm sure. That's good. Anyway, US yesterday on our abbreviated show before the big old came along. I'm solid. And let you guys out a couple hours. We're less and less than we agreed to it. And your general manager by the way had no idea that that was going on yesterday. That's how out of touch he is. He's worried about important things like Clarence's wardrobe. Things like that. What is the measure of man you asked yesterday? 630 votes on an abbreviated show. Right. How are the girls going? What? Put it on at nine in the morning. Yeah. For what it's worth. No, it's a holiday. It's an abbreviated show. And on a holiday. I'm not knocking the number of votes. When we give the result, we always give the number. Okay. Put it in perspective. Now we have 589 today. And of course all that we started this one last night. So I got it. Not that early though. I think about 10. 590. 590. I thought it was 560. Well, we're all over the place. Some days we splatter. Some days we're like 540. 540. We're all around. That's what we added. It was there over modulating pump out about 100,000 months like. What's the measure of man? How honorable he is. He's 44. Well, that's crap. Yeah. And that was an out of thought. I put that on like at the end. I'm going to show you right away. And that's because they're most of the audiences dishonorable. They lied. Right. I hate this poll 84. How much money he makes 31. That's a good choice. How long it is 31? Choice. Well, that way. Speaking of that impacted first. It goes to show you when you hold your hearts into long. You want to die. That's right. Like Morris Gibb. So I think we have a suit choice just based on that. He's jeopardizing our health by making us hold our first pressure to dangerous. Right. He got his, uh, how hot his wife or girlfriend is 26. Well, what does that mean? That's how you measure man by how hot his wife or girlfriend is. What does that say for him? I see a lot of guys with real hot wives or girlfriends are both. And they look like, uh, some stuff I stepped on. Some of the time. They must have money. How many women he slept with 19? How much pain he can endure 13? Oh, they showed a thing about what the, uh, Opus day last night on CNN. Oh, yeah. So, fly gelatio. So, I said, I think they have to wear around their waist with those sharp pointed. Oh, got so looped. Oh, man. They got more and more. Like, like, just people. Oh, bro. Right. Uh, how much she can drink 12? Well, he's a crash court. As he's a real man. He can pack it away like he wouldn't worry. Right. He can doubt him. How tall he is nine? How many fights he's one only one? So I meant. I think I was going to fight with one lot of fights, but he ain't much of a man. That's especially with a voice like that. I think that's true. Don't be taken on my. Oh, and I hear Rocky Marciano. He wouldn't even hire voice in that. She's the top like this. Don't miss with me. How kick your ass? Kind of like when he marces. 27 past 10 already at 5. 16 WQA in. We got guilty at 2 mad dog at 4 Marlins on Dickinson's 3D. Those red heart Marlins, one of their home game we yesterday. That is shocking. Marlins and the giants in 705. V-Share and be there tonight and then any K. Follows the baseball game. Like I said, the bumper had great bonds. He's the 75th of today's pool. He sure had some nerve hitting the 75th team on the day before the giants came to town. That's why there was only about 2000 people in our last night. Josh was there. Did you see his hero? Did you go down and get his autographs? My hero would probably chat with Barry. No. No. I don't think anybody's ever had a friendly chat with Barry. You're probably not.

Oh yeah, I've seen where we were concerned about that. And then it says, you were being another A who likely to do a couple months ago, my pants are down. Herbert Cross-Bring sounds like you have a lot of problem with that, Herbert. All the time, I could have wasted our time with it. Just a single crap. I mean, who now wants to hear the same stuff 24-7, you know, over and over. It would be one thing if it was really funny and entertaining the first time, you know, and at Surrey's next MCM stock, how they doing really good? No, no, in the tank, in the toilet, just like Herbert. 625 votes on the pool today. What's your take on Barry Bonds? Well, at Surrey's time, isn't it? I bet you know what Josh voted. I bet you did. Greatest. Did you vote for that? I did, yeah. Yeah, idiot. But you take on Barry Bonds without Roy, it's just another job that's all he is 1802. That's leading the way. He couldn't lick the baby's job, 160, and that was my vote. Babe Ruth, my ass. His stats are bogus one-o-way. See a lot of these are true. He's good, not great, 54. And like the hump or an eye pointed out when he was with the paratroopers, he was a string bean. He went 150 pounds. And all of a sudden, he'd like blew up like somebody put that old bicycle pump deep inside his back door, blew him up like a balloon. Couldn't have been those Roy's could it? Uh, I hate baseball 52. He's the greatest 46 quizlings like Josh. Punks who haven't been around long enough to see great ball players. Guys, it didn't see Mickey Maddler really maze or really great ball players play. I hate him or Roger Merris. I hate him 35. I hate this pull 33, 628 vote. I didn't like that. We got 620. I think we might make that 1,000 again today. What do you think? You know, it's right after Holly weekend. Wouldn't that be a real feather in our craft? That'd be something. So anyway, I made that call on Friday to Joe Bell for about 45-15. I will not be making that mistake again. I could remember my dogs. I remember your dogs, both of them. I could have talked to them and had a more productive. In fact, I wish to tell they were still around so I would come right down there and talk to them for 45-50 minutes and then put them back in the urn or something. And more productive time. I'm just like farting into a cyclone. Just ridiculous. Iraq violence pain 50 lives. Let's get that stuff out of the way real fast. Although it's not a lot of it. At least 50 people died yesterday. I think it was 51. In a series of bombings and ambushes in Iraq, among the dead were two members of a CBS news crew, were killed with a bomber to the US military convoy and central Baghdad. One US soldier and a Iraqi transletter also died metatack. CBS correspondent Kimberly Dozier was seriously injured, but I see they're saying this morning she'll be okay. My question is, what are these people doing there? Oh, they're brave and heroic. Is that what it is? What are they doing there? Making money for the networks that they work for. I would have been in addition. Well, we don't see you very much live stuff from there, considering they got the satellites there and they got all these correspondence there in Yadiani. We see very little of the murder and bloodshed. We see a couple of quick cases. We see one there and then they get to see what you're saying. There you go. That's very well put. We see only what you're supposed to see in probably more than they want. Anyway, we got, oh, and look at this. Bush-pided fake news stories on American TV. You can't believe that, can you? No, I don't. Federal authorities are actively investigating dozens of American television stations. For broadcasting items produced by the Bush administration and by major corporations and passing them off as normal news. Some of the fake news segments talked of success in the war in Iraq and promoted the company's products. Investigators from the FCC are seeking it. That's what you ought to be doing at the FCC instead of worried about who's saying crap on the air and who's saying a meery about the Spanish language stations. You ought to be worrying more about what this kind of stuff. Sign information about stations across the country after you report produced by a campaign group, detailed. The extraordinary state of the usage of such items. Brainwashing, man, Hitler would be very proud. And I keep thinking back to that horrible thing last year that annual fart-fest that joke-fest that they have, everything's a big joke. You know, the one at Stephen Colberra got all the headlines about this year. The annual press dinner. The White House correspondent. Right. That's right. Where they all sit around. Oh, that's right. That just like they do, a rum-solves for a news conference. This is the same thing. Like everything's a big joke. And Bush did that thing about, oh no. No weapons over here. No weapons over there. And all these parents and wives and kids and families of all on friends of all these soldiers where either dead or came back like a body parts-mising. I wonder how funny they thought it was. I keep thinking about it and it just impures the living crap out of me. In fact, speaking of crap, I could have spent that 45-50 minutes on Friday. I'm the throne and had a much more productive and helpful experience than talk of your leader, man, your fearless leader. You are listening to the wrong people in that building, Mr. Bell. You got no clue. You have been there for six months and you haven't got a clue. What's going on in that joint? And you think I give a crap above within the water not these last days today. How do they how does she impact my life or Georgia's life or Josh Curtis's life? How much impact does she have on you guys lives? No? Josh, not too much. Do you even see her other than when she's working out in the hallway with her ear to the door? Well, we're getting changes on the log. Yeah. Tell us, that's what my log. Who cares? I think we ought to action-a-rass off on eBay. To report by the nonprofit group center for me, the democracy found that over a 10-month period, at least 77 television stations were making use of the fake news broadcast known as VNR's video news releases. No one, not one of them told viewers who had produced the items. Not a single one of our stations. We know we only had partial. See these are the stations that sell out. That's what the media has done. They've sold out. We know we only had partial access to these VNR's yet we found 77 stations using them, said Diana Farceta. One of the groups we search is I would say it's pretty extraordinary. The picture we found was much worse than expected going to the investigation, and just how widely these good played how frequently these prepackered segments are put on the air. Well, if news you get propaganda, just like in Nazi Germany, man, just like in the Soviet Union, they'd be really proud. Let's see, what does this say? Subjected to facts. WQAM and the jumbo tron of the heat game last night. This is from KP and Coral Gables. It says, seen on the center court, jumbo tron display and the ribbon tron, the long and narrow cover display of the circles in the air. We know it is. We know it is. We know it is. We know it is.

Sand and play is one camera. The best tailor is the champion. All by John. Hey, by the way, got one word for him. You know what it is? The aiming. Yeah. Saw him over the weekend. You can't afford it. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. What a screamer. 10.27.5. 60.17.Q.A.M. You're fair. And speaking of 66, I might as well move this up to the top of my piles. Because I don't think we're going to get any calls today. It's today after the holiday. You know, people are busy putting their, get so Bring up, put their lives back together again. See, that's one thing about the moral day like the 4th Did you lie in like the labor day and is there any other ones? The business shoes for outdoor barbecues and getting them just absolutely Clastered, right? Right. Right. I mean, you know, the significance of them is pretty much it's been lost. So those especially, do I leave any of anyone else? Same patty, which is more just getting wasted than barbecuing But that's right. In other words, you tell me that the average need of excusing a drunk. Don't, but if they do have an excuse, then they go, Oh, extra, then they really go nuts. Says the man of the green. I was shirt in the other room there. Would the clamor over, oh, he's wearing a green shirt on with a shambler. I thought it, lady. Don't let dust you that and don't wear it on Thursday. Would the clamor over religious, Terlady Da Vinci code barely fading a major Hollywood studio is mining the same vein with a satanic 666 marketing campaign for its new horror film. I underlined the word new. Here's another movie. Just like the house of wax, which that we make. I haven't watched it. It's making a run some of my cable now. Yeah, don't bother. It has no stars. So this is like one star, half a star. It has no stars. I don't think it has a moon either for that man. Well, I'm embarrassed to say that I saw it and it's not a good movie, but it's worth seeing just to see how Paris hilt and dyes. Oh, I'd pay to see that. And it's a good one in real life. But seriously, the original house of wax, that's in 3D. I don't know. You probably can't get that on DVD because you have to have those 3D glasses to watch it. Why did they do away with that? Was it just to have Spencer, the glasses? It comes back periodically. It's a novelty thing. And yeah, it's a big logistics thing. And the house, I guess, for the theaters. That was fun though. I agree. I remember that one movie I think was called the maze, where they had these giant frog who's jumping out of the square. Really? I actually, man, I was scary. Oh, yeah. That's like a Frankenstein movie in 3D. And then they sent them all back to Montreal. Anyway, the almond. Now the original almond, let's see. That was the one with Gregory Peck. What was the other one after the almond or the almond, too? We write, they had like 3, I think, in total. Did they? Well, the original almond was Gregory Peck. And what was, who was else was in it? Oh, if you look at it. Look at it. I want to say, I don't know. I know who it is. It's on the tip of my tongue. What were they? She's. When you see, you're going to be embarrassed. I don't know. When we make a Vesovite 6 horror classic, is the kind of film that routinely makes it big at the box office, appealing to the covet demographic of young and predominantly male thrill-segress like Josh Cortis. Did you see the original almond? No. You never saw the almond? I don't think so. Jesus. Now, did you get your rear window? Yes, I did. What about the movie? Leave a link. Leave a link. Leave a link. Leave a link. No, and I told you. What was that? Did you see rear window yet? No. I haven't seen any of it. I've seen a lot of TVDs. I've seen a lot of TVDs. I've seen a lot of TVDs.

If anyone has insight, let them calculate the number of the beast for its man's. It's man's number is number is 66. The old man is a story of the father who realizes it's about that infant son, Danyan, who has a 66-6-6 birthmark on his skull, as we incarnate in of Satan. Oh my God. A mailster of death surrounds the way a mailstrom. Ooh, that's a lot. Oh, yeah. The prophecy is peer-designs un-mastakable. If you're not getting as upon us, I wonder if maybe they'd do to check on George Bush's forehead. I want to say this to Kitton the movie was a lot smarter than George Bush. The US-A-Saintanic Promotional Campaign comes at a sensitive time after this month's release of the Da Vinci Code for both an outcry from religious groups protesting the films kind of. I'm so sick and tired of religious group protesting this protest. I've felt protest your ass. Protest your bell. Protest the water notes you get out of our face. Try. Normally a market is going to be very wary about using the devil said Robert Thompson Professor of TV and Syracuse University. But 66 is really merged in the pocket of culture as a funny thing you bring up when you're talking about a kid miss behaving in a playground. You say, I'll bet this one's got 666 on his scalp. But Ted Bayer, president of movie guide, a conservative Christian publication one to marketing could backfire. Anytime you're over-infosized that he monocon the Satanic, you're feeding the lesser-insing instinct of people who are susceptible. He said, the marketing could be the biggest drawback of the movie he also said. I like that. That's a horror case to tell you the horror case to tell you the horror case to tell you the horror case to tell you the horror case to tell you the horror case to tell you the yeah. I agree. So there you go. The almonds coming out of here is how would miss that if I were you. You go on and get the original one with the Lee Remick and Gregory Peck. So let's imagine Max Bod side of whether he, no father. He was him. I don't know. I'm looking. He wasn't in there. What was the old mother he played in there? I'm sorry. I'm feeling the emphasis. Sorry. Different double movie. You're thinking of the excesses like that's a bulletin that Max Bod side of his father Marin. Come on, Mr. You must add some bad, bad drugs over the holiday weekend. So I can tell you. I never let the big old rock saw that I knew before. I kept your ass off the streets. It wasn't Max Bod side of when the excesses. No. And Linda Blair was neither by the way. Now let's see. The guy that played fathered carous. He's dead. Yes. And there's no way we're going to ever think of what his name was. He better google it. He's dead. All the acting in that movie was great. Then that was just, and you're telling me to comedy. You're telling me, ah, ha ha. It is. I understand what you're talking about him. But it was still well made. It was still well done. They're going to go out. Well, especially if this fan of one where she was going down the stairs, backward where the headspin and all around, I was good. And then the one where she was doing the crucifix deal. So let's use this. Joyce, you. That was good. 702 votes. On the pole. But you take on Barry Barnes who had the unmitigated goal. Tid is 753 home run at home in San Francisco. And at goof all that found a ball. And you see that, I'm sure you all did. Yes, I did. The goofy guy. Oh, I got the ball. It's going to be worth a lot of my minions. Yeah. Not pathetic. By the way, Jason Miller and all that. Jason Miller, he's dead. Yeah. Never. We're going to remember that. No. We're going to remember that. Well, the last. Yeah, that'll be easy. Or Del Miller, the great harness driver, dead. See a lot of dead mowers. You know that? I sure have George Miller as a one of my very George Miller from the Dolphins cold health food store in the Gables. He used to be a guest in my show. That can be when I used to put those boring. He's a good guy, George. I wonder what happened. He got out of the. He got out of a retail because the demographic in the Gables started changing desperately. No, speaking, glazed IE. And he went to the police worker something. 1057 at five, 60 QM. We got the guilty show. We're two of the staff to know what they just do there. Oh, look at that. You got me so excited again about the opening up. Punced it down there on your audition line again. We're sorry. Go to a hate when they're happy. I want to kneel. Roger. Roger. Roger. Again. You've been dead. It's five, 16, 18, 18. This is the kneel Roger itself. This is your plan. What? Any questions? Last time we got the guys laid. Now we've got one for the girls. That's right. We're going to get you pregnant. Pregnant. But in the end of it. You're a bit the official mother of a morning show. When our morning guy knocks you, uh. Lance is saying, just be honest. Every no third color. When you hear this sound. We're put on a long record. And send the morning guy. Opening your place and make that two back beat. Good. Should the morning guy be unable to perform due to chronic evidence for any fertility. The overnight guy who desperately wants to travel for a form in his place. In that event, this station makes no guarantee. Spot eye color. Care color IQ. Humps your additional wins. Have the morning guys love child. A mustation career. They've got new generation of this. Keep the list. It's 11.02 or five, 60 year. At $408 3000 in small bills in my freezer. 718 votes. What's your take on very bonds? Without roars. He's just another jack. Just another dumb jack with a really bad altitude. 25. He couldn't lick the baby's jack. 135 even if he wanted to. He might. His stance are bogus 124. See all those top three are like, uh. He's good not great. 64. I'll give you that one. I hate baseball 58. Well, shame on you. Sort of mine. He's the greatest 51. Josh court is breathlessly. He was there to see very yesterday. Now were you rooting for the giants? No. Well, why not? That's your boy. I'm not a giant fan of a Marlins fan. You're a very bonds fan. Yes, I am. Well, how can you root against the giants if you're a very bonds fan? You just can't make up your mind. You're all over the place. I hate him 42 and I hate this pool. Only 38. They like this pool. And you want to know why? Because it's got a lot of hate in it. Like that. That's why we ought to bring back the exercises. Let's have that's how we can make some serious money. Let's write out about 100 theaters all of a South Florida and re-show the Texas system at the time. Right? And just show it to her. You can have that P-sup pool. Yeah. Are you eating now or something? Sounds to me. I wasn't just that. Was that? That P-sup? That P-sup? Huh? Oh, I was. Say it which from Howe's. Yes. Talk about it in here. Josh Eden. Oh, I finished my real quick. That's our best. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Weft. Wait till you hear this story. This is so typical of Florida. Did anybody ever hear a Waldo Florida? Waldo? Yeah. No. It must be up north because this is from NBC 12 and ABC 12. I don't understand that. Yeah, well, everything is going to go with the here. Jacksonville. But I'm just saying. Jacksonville. Waldo Florida detected states and active local terrorism and adult bookstore is cleaning up after a chemical attack by a homemade device that investigators are calling a weaponized destruction. That's where they are, W. Should we look at over here at the adult book? We're all here. We're a little bit right. Can. Here's a picture of the sign. The cafe risk K adult super center. Oh, that's the place that wither the million billboards when you go to the highway. Just like one every mile for that. Is she highway? Yeah. For cafe risk K. Wow. In Waldo, people who help prayer, vigils, and protest aimed at an adult bookstore along US 301 trying to keep the cafe risk K from opening its doors on time. Well, that must be whether all the billboards because they're trying to open trying. Mm. Those efforts have all failed. So investigators say it looks like someone has turned to what they're calling in. Clear active terrorism to keep the stores owners from opening up shop. Ah. Florida man. What about Toyota for like 30 years now about Florida? It's the deep south. You know, you can try to pretend well, we're not different. We're not like Mississippi now. Well, bam, I'm losing it. Oh yeah. Red next man. Red next cracker's Bible thumpers. The device discovered Sunday morning was made of two gallon-sized Fort drink jugs connected by a hoses. It's another hose job. Someone said it on top of the store is window air conditioning unit. The tentative say that person has strong one hose from a water spigot on the outside of the building. And push another hose into the building through a gap along the air conditioning. They stuck in the old tube. That water hose would turn it mixed it up in the gallon jug and then entered into the building and said, let's go County Sheriff Sergeant Keith Falk. I guess that's where must be in Lachville County. Where's that? A calendar. Is that up by Duval County must be on your own? A road of peace. Investigators say one of the jugs had a harmful substance inside that floating the store along with a water a harmful substance. And I guarantee it probably won't be the last harmful substance in Antwoley. We haven't identified was actually in the bottle and the system that delivered it in the building. We do know that it was costic it was corrosive and had a high pH level, folks said. Investigators said the state Department of Environment and Protection will test the contraption in slimes today. The finger out exactly what was inside. Well, it's bigger than that. It's picking you up. Not just in corrosive. There's Dana Bansch. Oh God. Let's get very bronze to see if he can swing the bed at her head. Yeah. Bansch. And smash it like a pumpkin and Halloween time. Oh, brother. The old shark. And then she looked like she's got a shrunken head seriously. The bottom half of it is shrunken more than the top half. Wow. Strange. Yeah. It's homemade but highly effective. The device had the hazmat teams in full year Sunday morning. While yesterday, cleanup teams had stripped the room bare. Everything that was inside is now outside. The contaminated trash build two dumpsters. High above the dumpsters, a security camera is strapped to the pool. Investigators say it was rolling Saturday when the device was planted. We do have some very good leads. We have some people that weren't just in left. Probably some good people of God. Some good Christians know that. Nobody was hurt by the chemical investigators say cleaning up code cost more than 15 grand. And that's the hazmat bill of around 15 grand. And you see it's been a cost of the event.

What a fun way in the Templar. He used to run the Macy's. And how do you get his advice?

And let me tell you all you kids around a school now. If any religious like the watch tower people come knocking on you door. Right. Like your home from school trying to probably use some religious crap. Just go on to the drawer where Danny keeps his gun and pull their crap away. Okay, now don't do it to the Mormon's.

Because now we got that new lawn float. You're a dog topper. And if somebody represents a threat to you, you just pull out a piece and pull out a crap away. And that's a way to do it. And not only would you get off easy, you get off Scott free, but also you get like a Purple Medal in the Gold Jelly Bean. That's right. Well, I'm here. Oh, speaking of bosos, there's your buddy.

Okay, trust me. And if they did that, then they would public in the, Congressional Republicans would lynch his ass. Okay. Get out of here. See, this is, uh, what do we deal with here, man? America. What are we dealing with there? We're talking about illuminating angels and demons. You notice that I never got one call or one facts from anybody who said, Oh, gee, thanks for turning out of that.

We're gonna get a ring for a try. That's exactly the one thing, your Halloween's going to be on South Carolina to be the Christian state. How about like Massachusetts for all the atheist mechanisms? Why Massachusetts? Because I'm just thinking of a place where there's already a lot of liberal people, although we got that heavy, can't really clue the little and Boston, we're just saying, we're saying, I'll im can't expect to England. I think it'll a little bigger, I've got to look at the Queen, we'll see. Like where? Like Washington State or Oregon since we were just having that. She's a range all the time there, all the other Massachusetts into, you make it lush and dust free. It makes it for lush, yeah, believe that. You and at Northwest man, I don't want to love the Northwest. I've always constant, never been there. To the people who are there. I'm trying to think of a place where we don't already have like so many Bible thumbpress, right? Like the North Korean course, so it has to be outside of the US. How about Hawaii? Like, okay. Oh yeah. No more religion in Hawaii, that's what I say. Religion could be like surfing, surfing in the food and getting laid. I think that's really what's all about already, right? It's been a long laid. Downloads of MedPour and we're headed record high. Record numbers of people are downloading pornography from the internet. A survey we've revealed yesterday is that that's some big surprise. Oh, don't tell me anything. She is pissed off and fired up man. She wants to attack the internet. This cause her daughters are a couple of pre-verts. But in campaign history, that has computer porn because worldwide spread it will give more men on real estate expectations of their love lives and threatened couples relationships. I don't understand what one has to do with the other, but nevertheless. It's part of the whole making a case against porn that the church is always. Oh, there's a lot more of that in their mantra that they can. There are also concerns that the growing number of people hooked on adult sites will fuel the man for illegal material such as child abuse. That's another myth that they like to promote. More than 9 million men, almost 40% of the adult male population, logged on to sex website slash. Dear more than 4 times as many as they estimated 2 million in 2000. What most of those men were trying to say is, I have no life. The number of women downloading internet porn stored 30% of the man. From 1.4 million. You go girls. And including, and that's not even counting, Murray Osmond's daughters. That's what catching up to do. 40% of couples having problems with their relationships, they internet porn is at least partly to blame. Ah, perfect. And what George says that? Yeah, yeah. And what I see George said is, wife is all to blame. Relationship experts said women have to compete with perfect models online, which could lead to exploiting the women people unable to hold down normal relationships. Yeah, not to be able to look like her. How can they all look like him? I can't really look like it. Christine Lacey, a senior counselor with relationship advice service relate. Said on the internet, there are no bounds. You can look at the most perfect bodies doing the most unusual sex practices and having sex whenever you want to watch. And of course everybody is thinking, oh, right. Why do you need to go online for that? You don't. I'm saying it is in the T cable channels and the JIR or VVD. Some of you magazine the trip. I think you're going to go into a video. I got so I'm going to go into a video. Like that. So I'm going to go into a video. Yeah, and you're going into a video. I said they're in the wall though. And the size parlour. Now I go in with it. What normal woman can compete with that? If people are watching this sort of thing all the time with that contact with other people, it can normalize it. Clinical psychologists and author Oliver, something said, I can't read that last name. It's got the blocked up. If a man looks at a lot of porn, which women are essentially slaves, it interferes with their ability to stay in a real relationship. Or her. A lot of things got some good whiffs and chains like Josh has got. Right. The cable. What do you laugh at about you told me that you tie her up by do that. Is something and put her in chains and tie her up on a wall? That's right. And put that red rubber ball. A voice was kind of enough to send by and her mouth. Careful, though, because you never know where Joyce had it. The finding, be sure, wants you to off. The finding is a made of what is thought to be the first definitive study of internet pornography for the independent and Britain on Sunday by endless Neilson net ratings. The research file that men and women who visited such sites spent 40 minutes and average each month, each month, looking at images. Well, 40 minutes each month. That's like about, what, a lot of minutes a day? That's nothing. What? I said, that's nothing. One and four minutes, 25 to 49, around two and a half minutes, viewed online hard core images in the past month alone. One and four. I think it's more like five and four. That's one point three minute today. And the explosion internet pornography, you know, it's 11 minutes. Oh, whatever, whatever you say. And the explosion internet porn is also resulted more than half of all. Know you're right. You're right. 1.3 is correct. Resulted more than half of all children viewing it. It all images while looking for something else. Liberal Democrat health spokesman Sandra Gidley. This is in Britain said she was alarmed by the material available. And especially how easy it is for children to be exposed. Oh, yeah, here we go with the children. I think much more dangerous for the births is to be exposed to that royal family. And they're all a bunch of pre-births. Including that, including that Prince Charlie there, who was buggering one of his of butlers there and all of a sudden they covered that syrup realized. They paid some people off and shut them up real fast on that. Just like that whole Diana business man. After we're finished with that illuminating angels and demons and seeing about the Romans and the corruption in the catla church. Let's do the next expose. Let's make a movie out of the world by Kitty Kelly. Right. And see we'll just work on our orders. Barbara, we're breaking down again in the pre-noses if we need to see that again. What? Why do we need to see this again? What? Who did it? Cole? Because it's sick to make a sick to our stomach. Okay? Including this guy there on CNI can't deal with him. What's his name, Tony Saturnus? Like Mokor guy? Dr. Liberty. What? Jack S.C. It's even even read the news he just editorializes. Oh, fuck. Everything's like a big comedian. Think she's doing sit down comedy. They got the most anxious people on that network. Including that fat face to hero yours, Lou Dobbs. Man, I hope you'll look for the legal alien. With nothing. The rag is fantas across the Mexican border. Make tacos out of him. 800 and 2 votes on the pool. Oh, it's his birthday. And very friendly. And very cooperative. He does pretty much anything. He's doing fine, Barbara. Just calm down. He's doing okay. 800 and 2 votes. What's your take on Barry Bonds? Hey, Barry. Take a big fat one. That's our take on you. Barry. And the lighted up. Oh, that's where he wins. I didn't confuse. See, Barry, ain't into that smoke. And that wicked weed like you guys. He's more than that, the shwerin. He's a smoke that creamed. He let shrivers it. Needles. I'd say, here without roiids, there is just another job to it in 27. He couldn't look bad. The baby's job 153. A lot of jobs in here. His stance are bogus 139. There's no doubt about that. Totally bogus. Drug induced piece of turd. We hate you, Barry. I hope you listen right now. I'm sure you're not. Maybe you listen to Stan Major. See, still alive, either way. How's my two grand? How to be about 10 million by now, Stan. Cough it up. Wouldn't that be the only reason you can cope with it? I hate baseball 70. He's good. Not great. That very 68. Very, of course, rhymes with. You're fairy. He's the greatest 56. As in Q 56. I hate him 45. And I hate this pull only 44 out of 802. That's. They like to pull the Dan very, but it's timely. It's right on target. He's in town. Don't forget we got that big Marlon game tonight. Any interest. There'll be a few people there. And by the way, didn't Norma can't say. They'll couple of weeks ago. He wasn't going to any more Marlon games because they're non-capist. Weeness or something like that. Did he say that? They can't compete. He's not going any more than he say that? I think so. I heard you say that right here on this very important radio show. And again, full of craft, man. Calls me from the ball game last night. Yeah. All I did was copy and was in Cipin idiotic email that I received from Joe Bell about the Waternotsie, which I thought I would share with my first while agent attorney and Faggot. And he has to call me from the ballpark. So I can hear all the sound. And I can hear a hot dog. Stop. I could hear the vendor. There was no crowd. He said, that's why I can hear everybody because he's nobody here. Joshua's there. Were we worried about we unit press box? No, I wasn't. You were not? No, I wasn't. I mean, they didn't even let you win or anything. We're after the terrible things you said about Dave Van Boring and Roxy Foxy. After you've talked about Dave Van Boring's bad hairpiece. This is Neil Roger. This is 516A. Oh, the crap you can unwrap all the slime all the time. A corrupt, flat, bite away some. I've been given it some score. How many tickets? I know that me and you, to the dooms. Much better go with six to ten. And not in five. A gentile in the cranky dooms. I think we might be happy to get there. I think you really got out of your mind. You got to have your weary bed. And strap on to sight. No chance I'd always show it to you. I'd rather die. We'd be cry. We'd be cry. And I'd always show it to you. I'd rather die, we'd be cry-feet and get there. Sorry. How have you know that I'm a keep buggy to open highly tall. I've been with you, I have nobody party by a few. You're not pie cutting. Me and all this crap would blow. No way that we had a fine that you'd survive. And I who'd want know He that he'll reachher Tyle wishing thy advice O, dear Lord Lord, ka, g'on! You! Get me hurt to be king! It's hard to say that to me For me, is much better since the 10th not five. It's only right that I'd you get worse leave the tight. I think we might. We have been taking this one for a long time. We took this one for a long time. What's going on? Oh, what's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? We're going on previews and there's only one for who. We're going on thegg answer. We're going on the third for. No, no, Charlie. Shift. I bet it was a matter of a little bit too tight, didn't it? What do you mean? Listen. No one knows. Yeah, it's not. All right. Okay, Mark had down something to do. Instead of going out and buying that book, thank you, Liz, for factoring this in. She says, I have read the book ruled by rule by secrecy by Jim Mars. Among most of the book is very interesting and probably accurate. And, loses some credibility to last couple of chapters. The author starts to write about the hidden history and origin of mankind, melding in his theories about reptilian flesh eating aliens, and how they created human beings as a slave race. I can send yours the book if you like. You want the book? Yeah. Now, yeah, go ahead and send it to George and we are keeping it out. I'm not going to read it. Thanks for saving me to money, Liz. I could give it to some poor homeless people on the streets. Spare some change, Mr. Have a nice day, eh? I can't give it to some of them instead. We're just taking it out to woodbine and losing it about 10 seconds to come home again. Wow. Yeah, he's interesting, but again, people I think everything in the world is conspiracy. And then stuff about reptilian flesh eating, as he morphed in the scientist I would say. When you say, I would. If there's any such thing as worse than them. Oh, and by the way, you got to correct something. The guy that called in last was the last week of the week before about that story about the dress code in Iran. Right? Gary Loup in counter punch rights. Now that countered an actual post is a crappy newspaper tonight right when piece of garbage. That's right. Now that Canada's national post has apologized for the disinformation article about Iran and published on its front page last Friday. Once you'd inquire as to how this happened in the first place. The post had been part of it on May 15, the Iranian parliament in past law, establishing separate dress codes for religious minorities, Christians, Jews, and Zirral Astrians will have to adopt distinct color schemes to make them identifiable in public. The new codes were to enable Muslim daily easily recognized non-Muslims so that they can avoid shaking hands within by mistake. Thus becoming unclean. This was absurd. The one Jewish member of the 190 member Iranian Majji, Majzli, is Morris Motama. Among others, we've noted that noting the Iran's the never put up with such law. He added our enemy seek for pay attention among the religious minorities, what such news, and to exploit the situation of their benefit. The legislature must surely count Iranian-American journalist Amir Tahir, or the non-Sense among these enemies. But what led to here to produce a sensationalistic peace, drawing immediate dam in common from Canadian Prime Minister Steve Harpur, US State Department spokesman Sean McCormick, and Rabbi Marvyn hired him to sign an amazing call center in Los Angeles. The hearing is after all a man of apparently impeccable, just for noistive credentials, watch it. He's been the Middle East editor for London Sunday Times, written for the telegraph, their speakle, and the health, and all these others. Or your health. He regularly comments El Mundo on CNN. Quite a range of editors consider him competent, so I think it's unlikely as peace was added from your journalistic sloppiness. To hear it was also between 72 and 79 executive editor and chief of K.H. and Iran's main daily newspaper out of the Shaz regime. Remember the Shahawat is a vakta used to torture people by yankin after fingernails? He contributes to the Nio-Khan National Review, and is speaking engagements are handled by the Warmond Ring Nio-Khan, vendedor associates PR firm. He and these colleagues have repeatedly urged the U.S. attack of a reduced regime change in Iran. The Nio-Khan's, of course, have shown themselves more than willing to empty to employ the seat and building the case for military action. It's part of their Strowcian Modus Apparandai. However, much of their intelligence about Iraq disseminates who Douglas Fights, Office's special plans, a mediocre sickle-fans like Judith Miller has been discredited. They're plotting on with their strategy of vilifying yet another regime to build poppinists for its overthrow. And it goes on. It's on our website, by the way. The Jewish representative in the Iranian parliament who's been outspoken before it's surely on target, when he suggests that some seek to exploit the situation in their benefit. They do so by exploiting ignorance, prejudice, fear and gall ability. They sure now, so much disinformation one has the sinking sense that, however, one tries to expose it, their plans in the short term will prevail. But those paying attention have to try and keep raising the slogan, stop the attack on Iran. Expresses our chance. 824 votes really have to think about that thousandly doing. No. I even got a worry about it. Well, good. That's great. We got so many other things to worry about. Although, have no fear because it's the water not these last day today. And that should take care of our programming problems. All of our sales issues. See how many of this guy came from North Carolina with a banjo on his knee and brought Chris Jones along with him, which is why our copy is stated in my series, Wonder Bread, which is why we had two of those feedback sheets in man and we will do him and feed him back since I'll give this him feedback. Oh, there's a feedback. Oh, there you go. You want to feed back. You got it. That's your only feedback we're going to get. These guys talking. I don't think they've ever really even been in a real radio station. You think? I don't know. My doubt choice has it. You have something. Let me tell you again. If you send Joyce 400 radios, she wouldn't even know where to start sticking them. Okay. Back to much less worried to turn them on. I'll draw her map. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, here she's got a big crack problem. That's what I heard. This is our end up. WQAM Hello. WQAM Hello. There you go. Okay. You know, I'm not saying noise. Oh, yeah. We know who to say. WQAM Hello. You also have an serial. Some of the lucky and his instrument vibrating in there. Yes. There's a show on each vehicle packed out of ER. It's really good. They show how our kids are being blown to pieces. Being butcher. The word you're looking for is butcher. Yeah. But it's really good, man. They're really good. I think if you got a strong come. Okay. Thanks. Right after you watch faces of death parts once you're 100. You watch that. Yeah. Americans, all they all these innocent people being butcher. And of course, Afghanistan, they're pissed off at us because while those Humbies have a little bit of a mistake. They're a little accident. They're alive into a crowd killing innocent people. And the, uh, the Afghans are overturning. They're like going nuts because they've had enough already. And the meantime, guess who's in sure they really went in the country. And that's a huge from Unicale. I'm a Hamid Karzai. But the warlords are back ahead of it again. Going eye-poppy. That's a number one export. That's a big deal of things. Keeps the country going again. And Afghanistan. Well, you did the job. We got a good thought. And at first, the Taliban who we heard were like long gone. Or we took care of them. We got even at the outright. Now they're back in the mix, as they say, in the mix. Don't you love that expression? Oh, yeah. Like you're making a cake or something. What are the Irish? How to do it with it? They're mixing it and then they're drinking it. DRAF! Number Tom mix? Of course not. The cowboy. How boy, Tom mix? Now, can I don't can you remember Tom mix? It can be, tell me. You remember, uh, from the old movie told me. Red hard. What's that was a guy thing? I'm not red hard. I was ready, Arnold. Eddie Arnold was a Jean-Otrey. He's dead. Where Rogers, he's dead. Day 11, he's dead. How about you even trigger his dead? I'm sure he is. And what about Tom, though? He's probably at the seminal. Oh, no. Playing in phony, there's airs out slot machines. Those bad machines, mine. Probably playing bingo, but he's right. You know something. How many people have tried to explain that to me? How does things work? About 30? And I still don't get it. It's probably just as well. Oh, I wouldn't go there. There's no chance to be going there. But now that I'm here, it's going to be after Labor Day when Gulf Stream gets going. And then you realize like, uh, but it'd be better if you could. Most of them get school. And then you realize like, uh, but it'd be better if it would. And poppin' us as early next year for the slots. Early next year, 2007. Who'd help? Can I wait that long when you're waiting for a good machine, mine? That's bad. This is the worst story in history. If you take the number of Americans who came home and body bags in Vietnam. And then add a 25,000, you've got almost 60,000 dead bodies. Two wars. Two, and of course, this isn't a war. It's an occupation. What's going on right now? They can be free to arrest it. War, war. We're not a war with Iraq. They didn't attack us. They were not, uh, we're not fighting the Iraqi army. We invaded the country. We're occupying it and people are pissed off. And we're butchering all kinds innocent people. We'll get to that. You see this story about Henry Kissinger? No. Former, you didn't see this? Tonight at the... Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, quite a big nod to China in 1972, that Washington could accept the communist takeover of South Vietnam if that evolved after withdrawal of U.S. troops, even as the war to drive back the communist drag down with mounting deaths. No, I didn't think that started. The U.S. President Richard Nixon's envoy told Chinese for a joint live. If we can live with a communist government in China, we ought to be able to accept one in Indo-China. Kissinger's blunt remarks surfaced in a collection of papers from his years of diplomacy written, we use that term loosely, released Friday by George Washington University's National Security Archive. A collection was gathered from documents available to U.S. government's National Archive, and obtained to the research group to classification requests. Kissinger's comments, a parallel in credence to the decent interval theory posed by some historians who said the U.S. was prepared to see communist takeover Saigon, as long as then have it long enough after U.S. troop departure to save face, to save face. After 57,000 kids came home and body bags, and a war that nobody still has any idea what was really fought. And now we've got 2500 dead Americans over there, plus thousands and thousands and thousands of people would like missing limbs and eyes and all of these things. Not to mention the tens and tens of thousands, probably over 100,000 dead Iraqis, which we still can understand, whereas the candy word, the flower. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5168. Mr. Dick Jenny. I like to relax, I have a very magnanimous size, my balls. I listen to the new Rogers 12 to 1 hour of the movie. And it is content down the street and the cause we have to enroll. 3-8 AM going back to work. Glad to go cast a bolt-tap. Hey, Jenny. Are you ready for this? That's a decision nobody booze. Wasn't it 37 years ago you went for a minute in your shoes. Another candy the avoids the bus stop. Which side can you bus stop? Doing it in the town, many hit the town. Kennedy avoids the bus stop. Cox, I'm gonna try to get home with another candy the avoids the bus stop. I am at Trova. I saw that your effort can be on bio the other day. About a week in the field of Kennedy. Ethel Kennedy. Not Ethel M. Who makes the chocolates in Vegas? Not Ethel Merman. Ethel Kennedy. Bobby Kennedy's widow. And remember Ethel Kennedy? What kind of plan are you living on, man? So who the? Ethel Kennedy? No. Get out of here. You're so full of crap. I'm not even Josh knows who Ethel Kennedy is. Who? Anyway, it's strikes me after having seen this long, arduous thing. I mean, it's generally speaking, a Kennedy is a bunch of drums and drug addicts. Not all of them, of course, but most. Would you agree with that? Okay. Maybe it's because, you know, Danny was a bootlegar and of course, Grandpa, although they say, oh, that isn't true. Okay. And I don't want to let, but I also announced he sympathize here. Mm-hmm. Not that I don't love Ted Kennedy or JFK. He was, he was no George W. But then again, who is? You know, although you can't say that in the soft floor because then you get that. That crowd that is there for, oh, man, pigs. Come on, come on, Kennedy. Yeah. I think that's your pig right over here. It's roasting. In fact, the pig is on the spit from yesterday's big barbecue and it's still got that big red rubber ball in them. The one that Joyce used to use. The road crash that triggered deadly anti-American writing in Kabul occurred because a military truck lost its breaks coming down a hill. And tied into a lot of cars, US military said that they, this is today's excuse, couldn't afford a break job. Channing, deaf to America, riders on Monday's stone, the US kind of went into the accident. Then headed to the center of Kabul, ransacking offices of international aid groups and searching for foreigners, Smoke billed from burning buildings. Deaf to America, we hate you. They were screaming. Did you see those clips? No. If you had been watching, no, what's his name? There are ABC. I can't even think of what his name is anymore. The guy from good, uh, moning America. Oh, Charlie Gibbon, Charlie Gibbon, give him a Gibson. He is so boring. I'm telling you, he's like, one step, he's like, David Hartman on two cups of coffee. He finally caffeinated. That's a good analogy. Yeah. He's just a couple of steps less coma inducing the David Hartman. ABC is always found the blandest, the most boring. Just like that George Steph on top of us on this week. You know, just because David Brinkley's dead, you know, when they took David off the air, that was before I had that fire in the house. Remember that was kind of sad. When David's eyeballs kept popping out of his socket during the show and falling on his cheek. That's what he decided he was just old enough to get him off the air already. Not to mention, of course, the fact that he was showing for that. What's that company that makes the, uh, that agricultural stuff? What else that crap all of you? No. No. Next you're going to be saying that the guy with a hair who's also dead. Irbler, herbal life. No. Any well thing with it. The dead's whole from the unrest rose to 11, most of them from gunshot wounds according to three city hospitals more than 100 people wounded. This is in Kabul where everything is under control. Not where that pimped that's stooge, how many cars I supposedly enlarged with that smoth of that he was and that thing he was and it said to me, it looks like a who's had shaco. Maybe he really knew the agreed on a con. What is this thing that you just asked me? I'll match humaker. This is from network. But I read a Joshua. Get off said. There's a comparing network to us some recent news stories. It's not a cute little. Oh, match humaker. We could make a series of it. It's suicide of the week. Oh, how violent are ourselves execution of the week? How are real terrorists of the week? I love that scene where they just pie-eyed there in a bar. Shumaker, I love it. Suicide. Assassinations, mad bombers, mafia, hitman, automobile smash-ups. The death hour. A great Sunday night, Sherwood, a whole family. From a press release and I'll sing A&E's private episode of two reality shows about the most feared topic of all the end of a human life. A&E is in development with two distinct programs that deal with the overreaching of death and dying. Last request in six months. A&E spokesman Daniel Silverman, these shows are still just pilots, but both of them are celebrations of life, needs of them are supportive of their very serious programs. Yeah, the death of the week. Yeah, match humaker, hit it right. One of the great movies of all time, anybody who tells me that they didn't like it if I was sleeping in a movie, is just a turd. Okay? With all the respect. At least a Tommy. No, just a turd. How could anybody not know that that's one of the most espacialy. Time is valid and out of the state of the world. Which is what we were, you know, especially in South Florida where we threw up watching channel seven so many times. Where we seemed to circus that they've taken what is supposed to be news. In fact, one of the stories I got here were to tell us it. You know, my pile, I got a big pile every day. Now, I got real piles. Iraq veterans wonder about a public of sex by American idol. Oh, A&E men, A&E sister. Halle Lua. American idol, my ass. 850 votes. I guess I better just keep banging on that because if we don't get to the phasm, we're going to be really pissed off. It'll be my fault. I was playing Josh for not leaning on it. Hmm. Duff told me the same thing. 850 votes on the very bonds pools. Kind of a limited thing, you know. Although only 48 say I hit this pool. That's pretty low number. It's on the bottom. So like that, try on the bottom yogurt. Hmm. It's been a while. Time you know what? Try out on the bottom. Tired of the same old flavors of yogurt. Cherry, strawberry banana, peach, blueberry. Hmm. Well, look how taste buds prepare yourself. Palette for Cruzons, Trattle in the bottom yogurt. Count on the bottom. Count on the bottom. Count on the bottom. Count on the bottom. Count on the bottom. Count on the bottom. Count on the bottom. Cruzons, new Trattle in the bottom yogurt. Combining to delicious attributes of yogurt with hearty chunks of rainbow trot. No frills. No gills. Just great taste. Cruzons, Trattle in the bottom yogurt. Regular and DI. See, I know. I just don't understand it. The whole, in fact, what's that goofball from Britain at the food channel? You would know because you don't watch the food right now. But anyway, he's been in Sicily glass couple of weeks and he's making food for the Sicilian Sicilian Sicilian. Hmm. Too much fish. Too much pear, man. I don't understand the whole fish thing. I mean, just, you know, and then of course, I guess it's the same with the sushi people. Yeah. Who do I want to eat something when it's looking back at you? Me? You do? You like sushi? Yeah. Get out of here. Oh, oh, no. So the jar. So the jar. Oh, that's right. Hey, you're in sushi. No, a jar is took out for sushi. Drash took you off for sushi. That's right. And was great there in on this? No, we couldn't find his number. No. Wait, did you hear this? The column. Peter Curth, who has his own website, Peter Curth.com. Is that the food guy? No. George and Tony Sidney Tree, K-I-L-I-N-G. Did you like the headline? It's cute. You can imagine the depth of my emotion. I'm sure when I read about the Joint Press Conference, given to watch and lastly, by a fearless fewer George's W.B.B.B.B.B.B.B. and his chief ally in both conspirator and the war in terror, British Prime Minister, and Quicken, Quizzling, Tony Blair. Fearless fewer and Quicken, Quizzling. Oh, you got to love this. Blair was in Washington for what he called talks with the President. Imagine how much fun those must be. And after we're facing reporters who appeared this made in tongue-tie for the New York Times. But why wouldn't he? Thanks largely to the ongoing slaughter and Iraq, Bush's Sanging Approval ratings, or Blair's Sanging Approval Rains among British voters, are even more awful than Bush's are here, which is to say in Britspeak, they're very awful indeed in our own language. They're lousy. They stink. Bush's favorable ratings are now in the 30% range. Not 30% range. And where is clocking at a mere 26%. If I may lapse from all of the TV, Renactor and Language of Advertisement's end to teenage boys, these numbers really suck. U.S. political commentators repeatedly voiced wonder with a world leader with worse ratings than George Vorset, the Guardian of London. The Guardian further observed that, for once Bush had to come to the Prime Minister's verbal rescue, in the face of the skepticism of the British press corps. It is much as Blair LaVaria weary and under pressure, and is if he would have preferred to be someplace else. The British have long been mystified by the tenacity with which Blair clings to a special relationship, where they dung her headed mass killer like Bush, but unlike their American counterpart last week, the British media generally refrain from falling, and carrying on about these subdued, repent and almost remorseful atmosphere, and watched in the latest Bush and Blair dog and pony show. By the way, that whole thing was orchestrated and written ahead of time, that whole remorseful, that whole big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big. I read that story. Yeah. On our website. Yes I did. The news conference in the formal setting of the Eastern was notable for the contriped tone of both leaders of the Timesville fan with du Soleimity, and in that unusual admission of a personal mistake, Mr. Bush stated he regretted challenging, and said to the American bring it on in 2003, and said the same about his statement that he wanted or some of it, law and debt or lie. To the amazement of the American press, W. confessed that this was the kind of tough talk, you know, that sent to wrong message to people. I learned some more lessons about expressing myself, maybe a little more sophisticated manner said to your president. I would like that. Right. So sophisticated as Bush becoming expressing himself, when asked what he'd missed about Tony Blair when the British people finally given the boot he answered, I'll miss those red ties. That's what I'll miss. As the Guardian noted, this was on par with Bush's first recorded comment about Blair when the Middic campaign was in a summit in February 2001, and Bush was pressed to explain what he thought they might have in common. Well, he said we both use Colgate toothpaste. Ha ha, a lot of card our present is CBS News marvellous Bush's unusual burst of candor, when he mentioned the torture prisoners at Baghdad's. I've never got a prison as the America's military biggest military mistake in Iraq. Maybe he'd have said that some of the bull talk he once heard is gone, but neither Bush nor Blair gave the slightest sign the intended change. The immutual assured course of destruction in Iraq and across the Middle East. On the contrary, after lawting terrorism and resolve and vision encouraged, Bush made a point in saying that sophisticated way he has, the amazing things about dealing with prime minister Blair is he never once as he said to me on the phone. We better change our tactics because of the political opinions, you know? Yeah, George, we know. We know that you were a liar in a fraud, but on a legitimate leg to stand on the Iraqi Fiasco. And the only reason you tried it out Blair on Thursdays because he's still poppin' in the West and you aren't. In other words, because the fool's are pretended to stay in our down, down, down. Americans are always impressed by a British accent. They'd be technically some kind of gravity in that's missing say in the phony twang of a kinetic Yankee from Crawford Texas. And you need Tony Blair's endorsement right now, or to continue the killing. Look, Blair gets out of it. I can't say, certainly not increased popularity in his own country, or your press conference had to be televised in the middle of the night on cable, no less, to minimize the political fallout. But I noticed George again that after you sang Blair's praise is then offered to buy him dinner, aha again, he didn't return to compliment. Maybe now this would bother me so much of work from a moral day weekend, and I hadn't seen the faces of nine dead, or modern staring out on a front page on Sunday's O'Cle daily. Nine for modern years, you're literally in the last year in the service of your ego and your folly. No question that the Iraq War has, you know, created a sense of consternation here in America, you remarked. I mean, when you turn on your TV screen and see innocent people die day in and day out, it affects the mentality of our country. I can understand by the American people are troubled by the war in Iraq. I understand that, but you know George, you don't, and you never will. It's kind of like the end of my conversation with the Clarabel on Friday. For we said, oh, you understand, I said, you don't, you never will. And you know what I was when I said that? Absolutely correct. Amen. Absolutely. Eight seventy-five and a poll were entering or calling our way toward that thousand votes by two o'clock. We're going to do it.

And have it along for all of this. No brainer. It's kind of like Eric Clapton's kid flying out the window.

Only the Marlins and then I actually have a worse record than the pirates. They don't draw flies. Even if they had gigantic manure piles all over the field, they couldn't draw flies to it. Am I right, Josh? You all right. They got a new stadium. How they doing? L stinko. Marie Coco. I wonder if she's kind of James Coco. Hi, Jimmy. You're fair. She's a communist for the Washington Post. She says, there are accidents. Wonder about a public obsessed by American Idol. For Jeremy Bruce Sarder was the drama of sexual assault allegations against NBA star Kobe Bryant. And the buzz over the TV series, Query for the straight guy. For Rich Murphy, it was the media's fixation with Britney Spears and Michael Jackson. And the enduring annoyance of the American public's obsession with American Idol. When Paul Reichoff returned from battle and Iraqi discovered a citizenry uninterested in debating the correctness of the comic. Or even how it's course affected those who put their lives online. And study found that people were obsessed with Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction. Now it's Brand Helena and of course with a broken legs, his Reichoff who upstart Iraq and Afghanistan veterans of America, which calls itself the largest veterans group for those who served in America's latest work. This is the most important story of your life. This is where it's at. This horse with a broken leg is driving like crazy, right, Cops and if you were through the injured Kentucky Jeremy winner, Barbro. You come back from war zone and this is what you see. Over and over and over again. See what I'm saying? Uh huh. This is where it's at. The media and an all-too-welling American public and I don't forget to check in a Ruba man. Oh yeah, my favorite kid. Don't forget about that bitch. It's better than pay. Yeah. She's like to look up for us. She sleeps with her fishes. I did another suspicion that, Dish to. If there's a point of disagreement among America's newest veterans, it seems to be that Americans at large are detached and disconnected from the very idea that the nation is at war. True support for the Iraq conflict has embed as the horse gone from being seen as a triumph of shock and awe to a terrifying descent and a civil mayhem. Mayhem murder and bloodshed. True there are those who fiercely debate whether the West troops should be pulled out immediately should be drawn down on by the way they just sit and 15 hundred more troops. They're not drawing down anything. They just sent 15 hundred more because it's chaos. Fresh meat. Should be drawn down according to a timetable or whether the military commitment should be open-ended. But these conversations seem to echo only in certain corners of society. The more than a million servicemen and women have been deployed to a rack and Afghanistan since these military operations began in 2001, the all volunteer military means that fewer Americans actually know someone who is served. It is profoundly unlike World War II when a generation of youth saw action or played a role in the war effort. Who could not be less likely at none when the draft filled the seemingly endless need for fair soldiers and filled the streets of home of protesters and filled the body bags with 57,000 dead Americans. And when we kiss and you said, well if we could have got that article, it just makes me sick. How come he's not on death row that Nazi vastun? Most people in America don't know anyone who's fought in Iraq said right cop. It's like a TV show they watched in the switch back to desperate housewives. Research now a Howard University law student told me, suppose that this odd detachment is better than what his father endured when he arrived at the Seattle Airport first from service in Vietnam. This guy runs up to him a spit in his face in yells baby killer his own home coming in late 2003 before we become clear that the red conflict was turning into a dronocular war was marked instead by a proctory of expressions of thank you for your service and few questions about the word self. To me I had a hard time adjusting because people didn't want to talk to me about the war they wanted to talk about Kobe Bryant, who starts it. The public disengaged memories these veterans not so much because they agree on what should be done in Iraq now they don't but because the nation seems not to notice them. The veterans administration is grossly underfunded according to most independent estimates. It is hard pressed to meet even the needs of aging and W.W. to and Vietnam veterans. Today's all volunteer military often drives recruits among those with few opportunities for education and economic advancement and many veterans are discharged without the skills needed for civilian employment. The local health problems have been documented among returning troops at an alarming rate estimates of number of returning Iraq and Afghan vets who are already in the homeless range from 2 to 400. According to Cheryl Bevere's door for the national coalition for homeless veterans but she cautioned the numbers likely to grow over time as it did for Vietnam veterans whose long-term adjustment problems were immediately apparent. Vietnam vets took eight to twelve years before they really became what we call hardcore homeless she says. The moral day came with most Americans more eager for picnics and departments to her sales than for patriotic parades and an irreversible cultural drift. Murphy returned from Iraq in August 2004 and he probably spent one spend today with baseball and burgers. I'm not a big flag waiver he said. In truth there already are enough cars with fine decals and yellow ribbon magnets boasting support for troops. It's past time to abandon the easy civil symbol for the hard work of civic engagement she says. I'm going where you go over all the year starting into a winster money. You're fighting into a big wild cyclone in ways tsunami mommy silently I hope. Now loud and clear loud enough so that Joyce over there and now four miles get here at a navel.

I was going to go out and get that book. But I'm not now. That was. I mean, so this is the problem. It's like maddle and all here, you know. Before she got chopped up in little pieces. I had her on my show. I don't know. I was sitting in time. But turn man. And the problem was her that she was just as ridiculous as the religion is that she was ripping an ass. I mean, everything she had was true. But she was just such a outrageous person, you know. Not to mention fact. She made me look like a midget. Like my grandma used to say I'm a midget.

The people who were whipped up during Vietnam, they were all the sellouts, were in suits. That's right. Responsible fraud is now being sold out. That's absolutely correct, sir. They've all become establishment's shields of what they have. They're in different, they're worried about who's going to be on good morning on America and who's going to be doing the news on ABC and just like that thing said, who's going to win on American Idol and how much pleasure they're going to see on this world. I've never watched that show even once, even though what's his name that played Miguel on passion is on there. I've never watched that show not a second of me either. I've never known when it's on.

Whatever they tell you about it. But it would. But although our management don't know enough about the business to take it. Make up any stories. When I'm in the middle of that conversation in our art, I just can't even describe it to you how first rating of this and our new general man who's been there in half a year and he says, oh, we got a plan. We got a plan. But let me ask you this. I know you don't want to get involved in programming. What would you do? This is the same thing he asked me back in January. Her February when it was. What would I do? So what would you do? Blow it up, play up. Let you guys get out of it. You'd be advanced warning. Let all the people I like out of there and then just blow it up. Yeah. Just forget about it. I am what I would do. I pay everybody off. Ooh. Everybody under contract. I pay them off full amount. And then next to 10 percentages for aggravations sake. Just for destroying our livelihoods and our careers and our reputations and our credibility. And then I would then I would like to put on Hungarian Mizerkas. Right? Only a jerk had all like a good Mizerka. That's right. More than a half century after hostilities ended in Korea, a document from the worst chaotic early days has come to light. A letter from the US ambassador to the Seoul informing the state department that American soldiers would shoot refugees approaching their lives. The letter dated the day of the Army's mass coming aside for refugees at no gun re in 1950 is the strongest indication yet that the Central Policy existed for all US forces in Korea and the first evidence that the policy was known to uper ranks the US government. You know, I give him a hell of a hurry. Right. If refugees do appear from north of US lines, they'll receive warning shots and if they then persist in advancing, they will be shot. Rot ambassador John Jay Moochione is message to Assistant Secretary of State Dean Rusk. The letter reported on the season made at high level meeting in South Korea July 25, 1950, the night before the 70 US cavalry regiment shot the refugees had no gun re. Estimates very on the number of dead in the region. American soldiers estimated they have arranged from under 100 to 100 dead. Korean survivors say about 400 mostly women and children were killed at the village of 100 miles southeast of Seoul, the South Korean capital. Hundreds more refugees were killed in later similar episodes. The no gun re-kelling was recommended in a period of surprise when he stood by the AP and 1999 which prompted the 16 month Pentagon inquiry. The Pentagon concluded that the no-go re-shooting is which sliced at three days were an unfortunate tragedy not deliberate killing. It suggested that panicky soldiers acting without orders opened fire because they feared that an approaching line of families baggage and farm animals concealed enemy troops. But Moochias led her into case the action of the seven cavalry. For consistent with policy adopted because of concern that North Koreans would infiltrate via refugee columns and in subsequent months US commanders repeatedly ordered refugees shot documents prove. How is that sound probably don't look for something like during the burial bullet like when all of the girls are criminals and mental patients he said in here with all the other family members you know how would happen. Bobby Graham would have said when in doubt. How would that gun over huh. Sure you would have gotten lots of volunteers. That's bad. Probably including you. Right.

I'm a man, we're the wind. I want to find 60 WCQ, I'm happy Tuesday, May 30th, baby. This is a sickening story, Son of a wife, say tomorrow. Lodi scenes, hauna marine. Okay. I just read the chance of it. From the LA Times, two-terred. I'm a good person. It's a two-terred. Lance Corporal Role, Ryan Breonna, said he's terminated by two memories of November 19, 2005, and Haditha Herac. The first is the body of his best friend, and fellow marine, vulnerable, part just after dawn by roadside bomb. The second is the lifeless form of a smaller, rocky girl. One of two dozen unarmed civilians allegedly killed by mirrors of a camp-edaled and unit, Kelo company, third but tied in first marine regimen, first marine division. Bionis, a wide-resoft spoke in 21-year-old interviewed some day this family of home and essential valley city of Hanford, California. Said he wasn't among the small group of marines that military investigators have included. Kill the civilians, including children, women, and elderly men. Rob are bereonnaie, he's a ghost by the name Ryan, sitting at the photos of the victims. and help carry their bodies out of their homes. his part of the cleanup course. In late afternoon on the day of the killings. They ranged from little babies to adult males and females. I'll never be able to get that out of my head. I can still smell blood. this left something in my head and heart. He said he erased his digital photos. he took a scene. after first providers. haditha marine command center, he said baby investigators later. At least two military investigations run away in the incident and have the three-year-old Iraq War. Of the twelve Marines being investigated, three or four are far too done to killing. The others have been investigated for paying the stoppick killings, or for not reporting the incident truthfully. The British is the first of his units to speak publicly about the events. His account provides background on the Amosphere and activities that they knew for the first time in the Traumatic Memories that left in his wake. Susie Bionic said she's anger which he described as the Marine-stated adequately decompress him in other Marines when they come on from combat. She said she was writing a booktell, other families of Edward, which she and her son are going through. I used to be one of those Marines who said that Post-traumatic stresses are much of bullshit, Ryan Bionic's OS prescriptions for anti-depressants and sleeping pills, but all this stuff keeps going through my head, it's eating me up, I need immediate help. It's a long story, a little bit on our website tomorrow. What do you see in the Hanamarin? But we don't want to see that because that's bad for business man, although they are shown right now, the antibodies being slacked out in the inventory. The inventory is like a bit of a crime bullet holes, lots and lots to be examined. And now they're talking me like massacre again. We're going to seem to be doing these things over and over again. And these so-called wars for an over-reason. We can't imagine why so much of the world hates us now like poison. Just remember, we're the good guys, and if they don't agree, we'll kill them. Well that's right, I forgot. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Probably out of the sneak of few calls in this article, I'm just saying we have a few spotty ones here in there.

He almost killed one time and then he had an accident. He wanted to get out of the car. Yes. It was his time man. He was crazy. I'd say he was a really good dude man. He was a good ball player. He was. He's not dead. No. He was in coaching for a while. He was coaching in the minors and stuff. But he played for Pittsburgh for a long time. Oh yeah. The third base. I was really good pirate teams. Yep. That's true. Okay. Thanks. All right. See how to write. See how to write. See how to about Prince. He's dead too. I just don't have it here. And he just can't look and look. You looked and looked under one. I know I think it's on that TCS man. Or maybe I'll put it off the end. I'll put it on the end. No. It's not under Bob and Thunder Prince. Maybe it's under. It's not under. It's under baseball. Yeah. Baseball. Fever. Baseball. Violence. What's that? We'll be drinking. Every hand in. We'll be drinking. I knocked one down. We'll be drinking. We'll be drinking. We'll be drinking. We'll be drinking. We'll be drinking. We'll be drinking. Then we got to write. We'll tell. Now it's full of sounds. So I take the hands. And I'll set it off. Go to the amount of our dark lake. Third of. I'll take it with myself. I've been a gold prince. I'll show you that on a cart down there on a floor. You've got to have a cart. Bob Prince. It's his on it. One of the interesting thing is that I know he's in. Go to that. Three and a bottom of the 17th. One ball and one strike. Who's in the wind up in the one one pitch? One on. Go to the Jeefe right there. You'll get it. Kiss it. Good bye. That's nice. Oh, say to the he. That's crazy. Out of sight. He's cremated. Are the more the one cut on this part? I don't think so. Because this just says about Prince on this cart. When I was it. Well, let's see what it. Well, he was. I mean, he was. Are you. Are you. I mean, he was. I mean, he was no Dave in pouring. See this is what I'm trying to tell you. Josh, you all listen to me. Scott, three three at the bottom of the 17th. Same same. Yeah. But, I mean, just about every team had like legendary broadcasters. There was Jack Quimlin and Harry Kerry with a cup. And all these great fantastic and melal and red barber and Jim Woods with the Yankees. And Jim was worked with Kirk Audi and Boston. And then Harry and St. Louis. Great great sports canisters. And the Bob Prince and all these other people are now. Well, what do we got now? I don't even know who these people are. And then you tell me about Joe Buckley and a great baseball announcer. He's good. You said, yeah, he's good. Great. He's very good. I wouldn't put him in the great category. Now, he's no Harry Kerry. No, who is though? He's no Bob Prince. He's no Mal Allen. Right? Okay. He's no Ishkeh Vibble. He's no Dave Van Boering. Now you've got to admit that Joe Buckley is a very good man. Well, it's different. You know, it's radio and TV. Totally different. Oh, well, actually we spotted that time. I'm pretty proud of you. He actually made a response. People attempt it. 1,000, 1 vote. I'm going to tell you, man, just like driving over the edge of a cliff. Just like Kathy Bates in misery. I forget the beginning of the movie. He did drive all he ran off the road or something. Right? And she went and found him. She rescued him. Right? He was alive. There was him and he was, she was his biggest fan. That's right. The biggest ratists. He had a little bit of a kneecap problem. I'm going to be James Con. I was like, what's it in the kneecap? So it was his ankles. And in the book? No, no, it was not his ankles. Didn't she like to his knees? It was the, she tied a board between his feet. And not this feet sideways and inward towards the cut. Ooh, that was a broke his ankles. But in the book, I understand she cut his feet off. Oh, yeah. Well, if that's the case, then how do you do all the other things that we saw him do in the movie? I guess he didn't crawl around. It really, and a lot of pain I would think. See now that that's just ridiculous. How would he survive a few chapters feet off? Well, you know, he just could tie them on so that you don't bleed. And then he would chop them off. It sounds heavy like a book. Sounds to me like the voice of experience either that or somebody who's been studying up on his stuff. I'd be very careful, Crystal. I got plans. So I got plans. So I got plans. So I got plans. So I think what you're trying to say is when she cuts you off this when you're cutting her off. Well, I'm not going to cut her feet off how she's going to. Just for the way. Nice feet off. Hey, if you think you have termites in your home car friends, you're written pest control but they for a feature might inspection.

You can only, uh, get the one piece of vitriol that you asked for, and you can only take up pencil in with you and all. You know, there will be a day. We won't live long enough to see it when all that's going to come down. Right. How about all the porn they have there to bed? Yeah, you know what? Maybe they'll let the Swiss guard watch it to get them aroused. You know, they do. Here's a facts from, uh, Amy, a white female listener, under 35 from New York who can't wait for 2.30 Monday to Friday to download some show on her iPod. Thanks, Amy. She says, you are the greatest. Yes, I am. I get all my news from your show on my website. And she says, uh, P.S. Vans blows. That's correct. And say how to Josh and George. Hi, Josh and George. George and Josh. How tall Josh when he gets back? Oh, where do you go? I'm out of dues. I think so. I can't wait to get you back. You guys keep eating while the show is on. It's AC Doosie Tracy. I keep wiping the sweat off his brow and his lip. I'm glad that's all he's wiping. I'm the viewer, right? You guessed right. Aduce. And I heard, man, you know. I don't like you. You don't want to rush that. I don't want to come for a moment. No no. You know, I've got you up to me. Well, you go back and finish the job. You know, there's nothing worse than like, uh, cutting off and mid. Well, you late now. I have a more than you call that for you. You could take that. Two. And two late now. He's probably got a load in his pants. I mean, I don't get down with him. Like some of the people are woodbots. I guarantee it. In fact, there was. I was really late. He gave his. He said to me, I think that one guy's got a load in his pants. I mean, oh, he was like, swooning. And I want to send him just as he said. I just read to my nasal pants. Oh, my god. Holy moly. How do you smell like that? Thousand nine votes. Now, here's a little more on that thing. It's from our website. Vosius Candor was scripted response to planted question. Not that they're trying to like pull the wool over your eyes. The wooly bully. That's what they try to put on his dog and pony show it. Rain washed the public and lie. That's their specialty. Maybe we got to put great reading to cabin a man. He was pretty good at lying. Yeah. President Bush is highly publicized that mission of regrets and moment of Candor during that joint press conference. They were smoking at all. Right. That's why it's a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Tony Blair this past week was actually a scripted response to a planted question with a British journalist. Capital Hill blew his learned that the question was among a listed proposed questions given a British report is my Blair and at both the British Prime Minister and President Bush knew the question was coming and had prepared responses. Newsweek correspondent Richard Wolff says it was obvious to the press course assembled for the press conference that Bush knew the question was coming and had a response ready. Of course it was very rehearsed everything from the mannerisms you saw. The upwards glance up at the ceiling for inspiration will say, and for me, the big of a way was that at the end of the answer. I don't know if you could see it on camera, but the President obliged to big-grinned of those who were sitting in the front rows. It didn't seem that it was quite as contript as his performance. According to multiple sources, Blair planted the question with a British report is leaving England and informed the White House. Both Blair and Bush had scripted responses to the question and it was predetermined that the question would be recognized so we could ask the question. It was a set up from start to finish as a member of the press crew that covers Blair on a regular basis. We knew the question was coming and we knew Blair had a response ready. Asked her, Bush needed no if he had been briefed with the suspect he had. Two sources within the White House confirmed Bush knew the question was coming and was ready with his scripted response. Blair said to tell with his comment and the closing moments, you guys come on, I want you to the British delegation ask a few serious questions. The set up came in the second question, Mr. President, you spoke about Mr. Mr. steps in mistakes in Iraq, could I ask both of you which Mr. steps in mistakes of your own, your most regret? Regret, regret. Bush was ready. Sounds like kind of familiar refrain here saying, bring it on kind of tough talk, you know, that he sent around signal to people. I learned some lessons about expressing myself, maybe a little more sophisticated manner, you know, wanted to rely on that kind of talk. I think in certain parts of the world, there was misinterpreted and so I learned from that. And I think the biggest mistake that's happened so far, at least, to mark countries' involvement in Iraq is, Abu Ghara, we've been paying for that for a long period of time. And it's unlike Iraq, however, under Sodom, the people who committed those acts were brought to justice. They've been given a fair trial and tried and convicted. We'll say Bush has to go to regret route because his other tried phrases just don't work anymore. I don't think those cliches actually work so much anymore, he says. All the cliches, all the tried bull crap, all the time. Kind of like talking about management. Try cliches, try bull crap. So, but today's the water not season last day. Let's see if I get a response to any of my outburst this morning. I'm not, you know, something I'm all done talking to those people. Let them talk to Norma. Let them talk to you. Oh, here's two massages. I need to one of them from anybody there. Spam. No, it's just a news stuff, you know? Move on.org and some other thing. Tom Payne. Stuff like that. Stuff that's going on in the world as opposed to the nothingness that's going on there. But they got some plans, baby. We got some plans. Like whenever you used to say, we got package plans. Evil plans. Why sure, Miss Sim, I sure miss all the good radio people, man. They're all dead. They're most of them. Yeah. I'm just telling you right now, most of the real radio people. Of course, we miss such too, but you'll, you know, let's see. When you're going to have mine this summer all the time on Fridays as much as possible. He's busy, you know. As much as Ramson Crush busy doing what? Oh, who knows? Get out of here. What if my wife worked and I had my days free, I'd be busy too. Yeah, well, I think he's busy doing that. How do you know? Why don't? Stay as young somehow. Yeah. Hey, was telling you, hey, and I was risked sure we do what I found him out. It was only two years younger than you. And what you're trying to say is he sure we're starting to have 15 years younger than me. It worked for the great hair. Isn't that what you're trying to say? Yeah, he looks like he's saying it. He does. He does. He does. He's saying, I look like an old 12, but I'm saying it. I don't look no 63. How are you? Over 62. You look normal. 50 ish, right? I could pass for like 56. Yes, you could. Yeah. Well, how do you know? You haven't seen me in a long time. I got a chance to get in. I like my skin. And now I like redo it every second day. I don't let me even grow like a little bit every two days. I like to skin him for you. Right? Do you like to do? Do you like to rub it? I need to let my own hair go perfect. I'm going to want, I'm going to, I'm going to record. I'm going to pee VR that. You know, do you know that Josh Cortis don't have PVR? I don't either. You're on the R. On your thing, it's DVR. What what there's this makes. I don't know what DVR personal what? We're not Canadian. I have a DVD that can record a DVD player. Well, there you go. But Josh doesn't have that. You don't have it. I don't have it. I don't have it. I don't have it. I don't have a DVR anymore. Because they went out with Nicarious. I don't have a DVD. I've got a DVR for Christ's. I've got a hand me down. You're doing good. Did they make cleaning tapes with those things anymore? Why, you've got dirty heads? That's got to be. It's old. Just like QA and May. Me and everyone there take a look. Talk about dirty. Are you interested in the bathroom on the memorial day, man? It was memorable. They must have been a party over here this weekend that we weren't invited to. Or maybe. That will be a little problem. When we first time 28 passed what a QA of your cigar smoke or a love to kick back with a good premium stogi, then may he as cigars by Tony Barhani is for you. He started to find cigars are made with first grade tobacco process naves of the 10 years. But here is a real boutique cigar maker specializing in small bags hard to find tobacco. But he had gold, a flagship line gets a 91 rating by cigar fishing out of cigar and cedar and 9.1 by smoked magazine. This rich flavored well balanced full body Nicaraguan cigar has got earthy hints of dark roast coffee, chocolate, spicy and pepper flavor. Let's send one to Ray Nagan until he brought a cigarette. Also try to be here to say the hottest release of ground lies ten months. They say it gets a high rating of 91 by cigar fishing out of cigar and cedar.

I've seen bombs and blood. I've seen death and democracy. I've seen a lot but what have I heard? That's easy. My old witty. Will my friends and Thomas come? Drives the root glow up someone. You don't need to shoot any gun. Get a fair and flat fire, soft and full flat phone. Have the man that they're in this dream. If that's too much, but if it's too fancy, we go to departing what we did and have those chose it. And listen to those lion milk shoes. Oh my phone, oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. When heard that bomb, Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Oh my. Hey. In a country court of heart by sectarian divisions, the one thing since she got here is a complete and utter devotion to Lionel Witchy. They are a united region for Lionel. What are you going to do about it? You're fair. 135, 25, go to another thousand and 32 votes on a pole man. Everything is just going swimming well until two and then that comes along all week long. Oh God. Thank God for that big Orlando remote. Yes, they kind of Toyota. You know what? Yeah. That's what I said. Thank the Lord for that. In fact, you know, we can thank. Yeah. That one. I think I made the right choice. What do we both agree? Oh, we both agree. Oh, we have a productive two hours. At least more productive than sitting there on the moral day trying to do a show on a holiday winter night and nobody. I mean, only the most lifeless of the desparados would be around on the moral day. Right. When you agree, everybody was out at the beach. Tobacco deadly in any form of disguise is the slowdown of the world health organizations. Number one to the let me try to again, world note tobacco day tomorrow. Tomorrow. The famous false tobacco is not deadly. It's more than the smoke. A policy that confuses innocuous tobacco with harmful smoke is responsible for millions of avoidable deaths each year worldwide. This is in the Washington Post. Sigurret Smoke is a deadly delivery device for a benign but have it forming product. Nicotine nicotine isn't especially dangerous about like caffeine. Good policy toward tobacco used would reduce the grave harm of smoke by replacing cigarettes with non smoke forms of nicotine for the addicts. They might use nicotine safely forever. For whatever, if harmless delivery system were widely available instead. is never widely available. Instead, nicotine abstinence is the policy makers only approach the tobacco, like other abstinence campaigns, alcohol, prohibition, sexual abstinence before marriage, just saying noted drugs, this one is both more realistic and ineffective, like all the other ones. The human cost of the nicotine abstinence policy is doleful. More than 430,000 U.S. does each year, one out of every five can be attributed to, smoking. This is ten times our death rate from car crashes. 30 times. It's a third of May. I've read from AIDS. And on President-in-Tol, that's a testament to the inadequacy of 40 years of quit smoking policy. The surgeon generally reported smoking to be a health hazard back in 1964, but the net effective smoking cessation message is since then, is that between 4 and 5 percent of smokers put each year. Of the approximately 14 million Americans who try to quit smoking nearly only 2 million succeed. That's paid to the E-45 to 60 million Americans smokers, more than a fifth of a market adult, much of them smoke regularly, like George, he just knows most cigarettes. Great. The government and the so-called smoking each year. In fact, all of the Americans alive today who are most motorically, happen them are still smoking now. Obviously, nicotine uses a popular intonation summit. Equally, obviously, tobacco policy is a failure. Survey showed that a majority of current smokers were like good alternatives to smoke in ways of getting nicotine, but we won't tell nicotine users that there are safe ways to continue to dole the legal drug that they crave. Apparently, our policy makers read the CD's people get sick and die. That's right. Alternative nicotine delivery could be easy. The thing we're pressed into here, if we could work long term, come into patch or already available, but not to everyone. That's the easiest. That's the easiest. Also, they are still a progoli for short term use and can deliver only small doses inadequate for heavy users. Smokeless tobacco would work. It comes in several forms of one is two in tobacco made payments by cowboys and bald players, but other forms are handier, less messy and far less dangerous than smoking. I thought people get lip cancer and malatonalk as variances from, huh? They add all kinds of evil poisons and those things. So I see. It helped the officials label Smokeless tobacco as not a self-alternative smoking despite much evidence that it is quite safe. Oh, that is not a scuttle, I crap in it. Indeed, current policy is so what is nicotine, if since the officials rely, to destroy widespread use of smokeless tobacco is to deliver the drug. Just to put a pinch between your chicken gum. Yeah, for pure people to try to spin your chicken gum. As Carl Phillips and F.D. Mealagers said the University of Alberta has shown evidence points to a low risk of health as it is stemming from smokeless tobacco use. That includes virtually no evidence of risk of oral cancer. Phillips calculations show that total mortality from smokeless is about 100 of that from smoking. 100. And then there's what many smokers nowadays really do. Next periods of accidents encourage by smoke free workplaces and restaurants with periods of light smoking. Mixing light or occasional smoking without the nicotine delivery price might even be safer, but it can't be studied as a possible alternative because current funding goes on to research and how to quit smoking, not defining a safe level of smoking. How shameful that the U.S. is willing to allow almost half a minute Americans to die each year and that the W.H.O. is prepared to allow up to five million annual deaths worldwide all because of a delivery device cigarette smoke whose hazard that will not enlarge the avoidable. I never heard of anybody who died from a second-hand char. No, unless they're spitting in your face. No, that's true. We're not usually progressive public health established among us. We are generally not given to telling people stop doing what you're doing. We prefer health promotion in a form of seat belts, motorcycle helmets, condoms, syringes change, ingredient labels and warning labels rather than forcing people to quit their habits. But with tobacco weed get us in our tolerance and shore all our support to nicotine absence. We can't ignore tobacco in its one-dilly disguise cigarette smoke. Neither should we ignore a deadly nicotine absence crusade disguised as tobacco control. It's like smoke man, second-hand smoke. And guess what happens in Ontario on Thursday? I don't know, it's a big smoke out smoke. No, it's a little off. No more than smokeers. It falls to you in Niagara. All indoor businesses man, no moss, no more smoking. I like that. I like it. Only come on. I've never been one of those militant anti-smokers because they used to smoke a long long ago when I was in college, right? But it just by the same token when you haven't smoked it a long time and when you're around people like you blowing in your face, it's very annoying. By the same purpose, you can't find the smoke. I'm just telling you. I'm not talking about that kind of smoke. No, no, it can be done right. It can be done right. It's a very dangerous thing. And they always are dangling that bag of from their feet. It's almost like they're looking out of the corner of the eye to angle to make sure it's all washing right up in your post. And you always have the bad luck of being right in the spot where the smoke is building so it goes right in your eye. Right. That's right in your eyes.

This story epitomizes what it does. And also about those cruisers. What I tell you when you're out there in the middle of the water and nowhere to go. Yeah. A man returning from the British Virgin Islands on a cruise ship with his family through himself into the Atlantic Ocean after arguing with his wife and couldn't be found this by the Coast Guard Search. Carnival cruise line said this day, man. That is carnival legend vessel was on route from Tartola, just after 1 a.m. Saturday. When the past you've seen jumping overboard. That's a woman old, you're the one. Yeah. That's right. Guy and all is right. The coast. That's why they got all these windows and very few wood or was man. A woman lived to be like 90 in the guys at 60 they croaked from the stress, from the Agua from the Agua from the Nojiing. The convention. The nagging. The coast guard said AC 130 airplane crew to stand up for the man. But after 12 hours without fighting, they sent the cruise ship on and swed in the airport dock last night or Sunday night. The past years said they were told the man a father of a young child had argued with his wife and his cabin before jumping over the balcony. They said a call or a Bravo Bravo used to alert crew members to a serious incident was heard over the ship's announcements. Maybe they were just complimenting him on his dive. That's right. A point. Right. Even though 9.6, even though he decided to do that, it was still upsetting for his family everybody outside board. No. You people know cruise ships man. A sucker is born every minute. I keep telling you. God. Speaking of a sucker board every minute. Get in this wasting a lot of money. I don't want to say I told you so. But you know what? Did you tell us so? Yes. No for a township. Me, you can. The FBI is ending its two-way search of a suburban Detroit horse farm after finding no trace of Jimmy Hoffa's remains. Open Coutie. Well, maybe you think you just got her all the one there. He could open up Count Al Capone's vault again and find that empty line bottle. Open Coutie prosecutor David Garcia, Dorsica, whatever his name is, told the AMP. He was informed by Bloomfield's township police that the search was ending without A remains found at the Hidden Dreams Farm in Milford township. I could have told him that for a very small fee. Just a few months. I don't know. He just cost for $6,000. And I want to bet. Oh, I didn't know more to it. I think he was more to it. $1,000. And one cattle. Yeah, I know it. The FBI spokeswoman, Don Clay, didn't immediately return to call from the AAPC to come. I'll still embarrassing. Hoffa disappeared in July 1975. He treated her a restaurant about 20 miles from Hidden Dreams Farm. Land once owned by Hoffa, associate, Rallad McMaster. His attorney, McMaster's attorney, city wasn't surprised. The search was ramping up with the mystery still on Solve. We never expected there was anything there. He said, anything that the FBI felt like pressure to respond to the tip. Less than see what wasn't trying to solve the case. First of all, a lot of things do solve the case. Yeah. I mean, this isn't exactly like Elvis, where there are people running around, or Jimmy Hoffa still alive. I saw him having a couple of coffee at Starbucks. Nobody says Jimmy Hoffa still lives. He sleeps with officials, okay? Just like Luca Brassie. That's right. He sleeps with him. In the lawn, killed him, right? Like we don't know. He sleeps with officials. He was on his way to meet with two mobsters for crying out loud. Didn't you see the movie with the... That's right. It's then in videos in the movie. That's great. Right? Yeah. Oh, Joe Peshie. And Jack Nicholson. Jack Nicholson is in the Hoffa movie? Wasn't he Hoffa? That's correct. Now that you mentioned it. Well, I don't know. I kind of sourd on him after the shining. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That was the only highlight of the whole movie. That was the only good part. That's right. That's right. The big chase into that maze of... Which is pretty amazing. What's that? Well, the through the house and everything with the axe. Oh, yeah. And then there's also the chase scene at the end. We're in the snow where he's chasing the snow. That was a great big build up to nothing. Boy, he flew that whole way. He was going to save them and, you know, he's dead. He died pretty quick in there. That's right. He's got man. Can we even save that? He moved? Not anymore. Oh. Just got what you guys saw. What channel he was watching when he was, you know, on his little vacation there. Yeah, that's right. Watching a Glenn Rinker and a Bistrofen. It's an old thing. You're not going to do a thing in the theater. Because originally saw that movie in the theater in the down there.
