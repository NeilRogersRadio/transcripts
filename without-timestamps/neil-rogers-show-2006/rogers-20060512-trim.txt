So I had a good day yesterday. I'll take today off. Yeah me too. Do you win again? No, I'm taking the day off. Oh. See I went back there again yesterday. Just to give the money back real quick. I like to at least let me get warm in my pocket. Well I had the good fortune of hitting the pick the late pick four, which means you're eight no more after that. You picked it, huh? Yep. Well that's good. I'm off to Niagara so see if I can give them some of that money back from three four weeks ago. You know what's been raining very hard. It's more. Well a rain all day here yesterday, man. It rained like a no at a get the ark out all day and now it's sunny and it's so okay. Not too bad. But you need the rain there to wash away all that schmutz and the smoke in the air and all the fires. That's correct. And your buddy Barry says is the Marlons prepared to decline San Antonio. Stit him off or buy a Monday's deadline. What I just say, Stit him over. Highly a mayor Julio Robain has said yesterday, Spaceless ballpark, dear to get done locally. My sense is that it will get done. He says he's done. And we had a big 87 17 to watch Don Trail get pasted again last night. Watch him get just smashed. I saw a little bit of that just in time to watch him pour and it runs across the plate. The brave. Eight and what is it? Nine and 23 is that the record? Whatever. Yeah. Pretty uh, just normal. Although they're in Pittsburgh to play a team, it's right there with them as far as they're patting for the Tarlit. They're both right down there. They're a lot of losses. Many games are sitting in Pittsburgh right down there along with the Marlons. So it's the Tarlit bull this weekend. And the good news is next Thursday, we got a 105 Marl again, which means 1230 exit for this kid next Thursday. He has a new stadium. A lot of good at it. Yeah, they didn't do any good. No. Oh, that goes on everywhere. You know, if we just have a new or we now new stadium. Still a stick to join out there way down there, myard and no man's land and the nobody shows up. But other than that, why be so negative, you know? It's especially when the highly amere. You're always big in the highly amere's. Yeah. Well, this guy says that they're going to get the stadium, but all they need is they don't know yet if for a month or cadina's going to donate the land. And they don't know what the real cost of the stadium is going to be. But other than that, they don't know how they're going to make up over 200 million dollars. But otherwise, what other than that? It looks like a done deal. No problem. Kind of like Clarabel, Thomas about all the new or great things going to happen on this radio station. It's a done deal. Otherwise, you next week's schedule looks like the same old. It's fact there's the infidium warning. It still says TBD. Yeah, they're working on some things. Well, what's all this at me? They're working on something. What does that mean? Trying to bring some fresh blood in here to do the shows that I'm not around. Yeah. So we're working on some of that. You're not talking about those gifts from the Suncental again, are you? No, they're not coming back. No. It's OTO's. Why? One time only. Yeah. I see. Well, otherwise, it might be like Wally Pipp and Lou Gehrig, you know? So, while we Pipp was a district in WCFL Chicago, was that Barney Pipp? I don't know who that was. He was a real Pipp. Remember, while we lonely your gloves? Yeah. Lou Gehrig and in like never going back. And then, never got a back. 80 billion games later. And of course, whoever heard of Wally Pipp again. So that's probably a good idea one time only. I want people to get a foothold in there. So they're working on some things. So I can only begin to imagine what this is. It would get Joel fineburg his own show. He obviously wants a show. Let him go on your life or his teeth. He doesn't matter. To himself he does. Yeah, he wants to matter. He does. Oh, no. Well, that's what I keep saying. You can't talk to yourself into competing. You do you got it or you don't have it. And they don't got it. And they keep trying to talk this big game and use the media, you know, all their buddies in the, uh, print media. Oh, my God. The ticket this and the ticket they, uh, losing their ass is what they're doing. In fact, I love that line of his about, well, who else could've lost all those millions of dollars in just 18 months on a station that was actually broker, brokering out and making money before. Pretty hard to do, Joel, but you done it. Congratulations, man. Keep up. Keep up the great work. 87 17, a couple of thousand extra to see the on trail get sheld again. Hey, that's a, I know. I'm 30% increase in attendance. Lots of Michelle Don Trail. Well, he couldn't give us out. Where he's pitchin' like, but he can't get anybody out. He has given up seven runs or more in his last three starts. Well, he's consistent. Like the rest of his teammates, they're consistent. They consistently suck and they consistently lose and a record is in a bush and nobody's showing up. And keep in mind, this is only early May. These are the kind of attendance figures generally for a horrendous season like, you know, getting the August to dog days and some time away. So the summer. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You think this is bad now. Well, until July and August, first of all, there's nobody in town in the summers. You know, everybody gets to hell out. Well, you know what happens in July and August though? What is that? The red socks come in and the team's like that. Oh, yeah, that'll do it. The red socks will draw people. Yeah. That's a great, that could break. In fact, I was watching last night. I noticed there was, one of the pitches are with an accidentally scanned little bit of the crowd. And I used to turn crowd loosely. I saw a lot of people with brave suggestions on. Yeah. So 8717 minus a couple thousand brave stands, which means they really maybe had five thousand people in the seats, which are three thousand miles in front. I mean, when Norma can't say, he ain't going no more. That's the ultimate stuff right there because man, there's a died in the baseball groupie. And he just, he can't handle it anymore. So they're not competitive, which I think is a good way to put it. They suck. I want to see Yankees red socks last night. Now who won that game was? Three, two. I saw a little bit of socks on. They came back and won. Did they all ride? Let's hear it. All right. Oh, George S is going to be really peo now. He's going to be ripping a rod and this one and that one. He's, I don't like, I don't like wealthy people with bad temperasem, you know, temperamental sport, like sport with a rich kids. Hate that. Wow, the third basement made two errors. I was driving by, you know, like they don't have a name, you know, the third basement. I think the first basement last night was the one. Well, good. I knew I did to see that. I mean, okay. Anything bad that happens to George Steinburner places me. By the way, speaking of people having bad things, all are best to the beast. Yes. Tell us that, go on. All about George, George, George, what's the George court is saying? He's working with these bad issues and Josh, they're all told me that the beast is out of the hospital already. He saw them, yeah, but multiple injuries, but he's nothing like threatening for a child. He's going to have a pretty good and intimate time. He's going to have a tough hunting mode. And the interesting part of is you never guessed what I got in the mail just yesterday. In fact, maybe you had open a mailbox right around the time he had his crash. It was his wedding invitation. And that's something. I guess wedding invitation and I find out that I was more than a bad car crash. And he's like, it was a five vehicle crash. Wow. Made the news. He was probably the buffer. He probably, if he went to Banner, it would have been a lot worse. Probably bounced off his fat ass. He's got some groin. Their tears are something that's what I'm hearing. That's not good for the honeymoon. He has more than that. He has several injuries, but he has rib injuries, which is very meaningful. How do you find ribs in a guy that fat? You know what, I don't think this is a good day to be ripping the beast. I'm not ripping him at all. I'm trying to lighten them up a little bit. Well, that's not ripen him. Maybe he has a rough one. I have a rough one. There you go. See why now you're turning right around. Didn't take you longer jump on. Oh, oh, man. God, who the hell are we to be talking about fat anyway? Yeah, exactly. Very, very. You know something I feel terrible for the beast. I really do. Because he's a good kid. He really is. He had the stuff. He means well. He had the suffer abuse from someone consumable jerk. Not going to jail. He was so dirty. Oh, you know. Yep. Those are rough. I don't care. Yeah. And he endured that. He's a survivor. He's a survivor. Of course, the fact that he survived this. The fact that he why I am too. He's likeable. He's just, it can be a little bit annoying, but he's likeable. As opposed to some people are annoying and not likeable. Yes. Right. Oh, there you go. Oh, do it. Very annoying and very unlikable. But we don't have him to kick around no more irreplaceable. Yeah. There won't be another one like him ever. There won't be him. But he's just going to keep rotating that time period. You really believe that. You know, I keep looking at the schedule. I said, let me just schedule for a while. We're going to figure this is the week that was. Remember that show. This was the week that was. And I keep thinking, OK, finally. And I'm looking at him. Here's Bow and Gildy and this. And all the way. I looked at Thursday. I thought to myself, oh, God. There was a God. 30, a 12, 30. Marlins on deck. Marlins at the. A brave. Oh, that's all. Look to good. Oh, the frequency. That's right. Sorry. Well, that's your camera's up quick again. How two weeks? Yep. Well, I went by like a quick fart in the windstorm. No, seriously. That's a fast. Well, it's only tomorrow's only the first week. Well, we're looking ahead. So they're predicting what a field of like 8 or 9 and the edges. That's right. Now he's the boy. Your run is out. Is brother Dirk on a run? Yes. Hillwind. I give him a shot there. Yeah. This is his kind of race. Oh, I should have saved this story. Yesterday, one of the. I forget who the hell was one. The horse people were sent it to definitely should cut the Derby down like much more or feel that it's just. And that's what I told Dave. I was saying this is no horse races. It's a cavalry charge. What did Dave say? Wow. He said, you know, a lot of people on a run in the Derby. And it's, you know, he's right about that. But so big deal. You know what I say. Cut it down like 14 tops. Max. They think it would be an idea. I think it would be a much more. Much more honest. Really exactly. I mean, who wants to see. I mean, so many. What you look at the horses that had problems. Because of the big field who were better horses than that. Right. So what you see, we don't know yet if they were better horses than Barbara, but we may not have been. They would be better horses than where they finished because of all the road trouble. Horse like Bob and John was taken out of race on the first turn. Right. Brother. Brother. Brother. There was one like an extra. Epo Mila. I think he was like, you know, brother Derby. Why the whole rate? By the way, brother Derby does need to be near the front. And he also, you know, when we see the 19 wide, you know, that's not going to help you. Well, that's what I told you. So, that's what I see. And of course, I know nothing about it. And I'm the first one to admit that. I don't follow the, those, uh, phony. I don't follow that. I will watch it on TV because it didn't cost me any money. I'll watch it on a race. You know that we had the highest ratings on ESPN that we've had for horse racing show in 16 years. Six minutes to the race five of it. Hollywood Park yesterday. I'm watching the replays from yesterday. Uh, the seven horse. Take the seven. You know, I once had it. In fact, I think it was on a show. I was on one of those twilight's own shows. Something like that where the guy got the newspaper from the next day. And he had the race results. Have you always had that degree? That's the degree. It was a Hollywood. Was it really? Yep. I wanted to be a head of this fifth race. The seventh. I'll be damned. Well, I'm going to watch it and make sure he wins again. Do I get paid again? You might have some road trouble. Yeah. Yeah. You get paid again. You know, easy would be for me to open up an account on line. I've got to do his make a phone collar. Go on line. I could open up an account. I could make you, well, you could do it too. You're not that crazy. And you know, I don't think they allow it in Florida. They don't. They allow it here. Not to touch the bottom of the line. They're they encourage it here. Yeah. They want you to do it because they'll show the Canadian pool for all the different races. They show the pool on track and then they show the Canadian pool. I don't want any part of it. To me, it sounds like a cesspool. See, I think horse racing is a lot more enjoyable if you just pick one just for fun. You don't have to. As opposed to some of the peanut gallery that said, I really wish some day, someday, when you've got to come to Woodbine, it just just walks with me to people that stand around and their motto is, I have no right. And they just don't bet. They just watch the peanut gallery I call him. They just stand around and give people advice, oh, cash and out, cash and this stand there. There's one guy called Mr. pension. He's their every single day. He lost his whole life pension out. So his wife has to work because he's too old to get a job. He tells everybody who listen to story a million times. And all he does is stand around and take the free drinks. Never tips the waitress. And just stands there. I give people advice. Every single day he's their Mr. pension. Mr. pension. And there was a guy yesterday who was talking about Medicare or whatever. And he was talking about what a great job Bush is doing. And they could, oh, and the guy sitting next to me, he was a pretty bright guy. That guy doesn't realize it, but he doesn't have any money anymore. Yeah, right. You know, when he finds that all of a sudden Bush won't be doing such a great job. You'll be pleased to know, by the way, this will put a little smile on your face. Bush is down under 30 now. He's 20 out of 9%. He wants jab to be president. Yeah, I saw that. He thinks he'd make you read president. Anybody named Bush. How about how about the guy from where he held him. He read you Bush from southern York, Bush. Yeah, southern US, yeah. There you go. I give a woman, Vernon Bush to Jackie. Yeah. Isn't Vernon Bush your job here to see you? I think so. How about Nick D.P.? What was his name, Nick D.P. at her of the Jackie from Suffolk Downs? He was a guy, I believe. Remember that? Yes. Why could throw some names at your man? I could throw some names. And then we'll start throwing some harness racing names from old rocking hand park. I couldn't, I know that. He's these are the things that my mind is cluttered with. But you're G.D. Olivera. No, boy. How about ET beard? Yep. Where does he ride? He's still riding. He was like, when he rides in Texas now. Oh, he's at the alone car. That's where he rides. That is correct. Well, you are really sick. Just like me. Okay. Well, listen, have a great day. Keep it to pocket. Now because you got a big weekend coming. I am. I'm not doing anything today. We're both tomorrow. It's more of a big race day. No, yeah. Sad. There's a big day at Niagara Falls for me. So I'm going to be taking back all that money. I won't see if I can give it back or not. I'm going back to that same machine, man. Well, I hope it works for you. I know where the good machine is. I'm going to punch my guts out. Go get it. Have a great day. You too. He'll upbeast. The music's pressed on the previous programs. Are those of the hosts, guests, and colors? And you're not reflect those of the busy dry. That's right. That's the touch of the dry. That's the truth.

First, here's the good news from Iraq. Four more US Marines died in Iraq when they tank rolled off of Bridget into what can now. It was an accident. Not a result of an immediate accident. Not a result of an immediate accident. Not a result of an immediate family. He's a family. He will feel much better. That's correct. And there'll be a little bit less dead. And took place yesterday in New York, Karma, an ally in Bar province, West of Baghdad, was Bad Karma. The Marines were assigned a regimental to combat team. 5 this brings the US military death toll to 2434. Any interest in nobody care. They don't have to kick off American idol. That's all we care about. They care about how many did Americans in Iraq or how many lies or how many phone calls are being tapped. And in fact, probably don't call us show anymore because your phone will be tapped. Oh, here's the edgy junior. QAM. Oh, and I'm lying now. No one. Which one was that? Is that the fake Gilbert? Yeah. That's the fake. As opposed to the real one. Which means he's paying for it. Where's that? It's full free number. Oh, I'm not sure. Here's the full from yesterday.

Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Good morning. Yes, sir. Good morning. I think did you hear about the story about the guy who broke 12 nails and had tried to commit suicide? No. Yeah, there really was a gap in about three weeks ago. Oh, okay. Well, they were messed with you. No, I just thought there was a rumor that you did that after listening to any of my kids on two to four hours. It could be. Yeah, that's possible. In fact, he could've listened almost any day to do. I heard it was after after an overdose of guilty. Scientology 21 is Lomb 13. I heard it was after he heard the Dan Lepasterd for about two minutes. Sick. We got 10,000 people in the audience who are desired to be sick. Keep listening. You will be. Mormon 9. Hinduism 6. Amish 5. Amish and Amish. That's really Hamish. The Amish. I used to think it was Hamish. I don't know why it was said. I was said whatever. Amish. With long beers. In fact, what's the difference between the Orthodox Jews and the Amish? The Amish ain't got no sitis. 7 day Adventist 5 and Joe was witnessed as a solumente dose. Most of our audience don't want to go around knocking on doors. Peddling the watch tower. Oh, the final days are here. Oh, any minute and now the final days. There will be a response on the be your final days. I'm going to be real soon if you could tell off my portion. Get out of here.

Here's the baseball right up to the break. I don't have time. We got backed up for that long crossover again. We also had a long trip to the hang to jump all over the beast again. Amish and Amish and Amish said that days not that they'd be ripping him. And as soon as I made some kind of a comment right away, you're talking about how the fat helped to insulate him from you know. That's right. Now it's probably a good point though. When you think. Absolutely. I mean, not good for you. Unless you need some insulation little panning. That's coming. He knows all about fat. Okay. Man, I'm walking pencil. Jesus. Hey, how much you weigh about 175? Get out of here. Yeah, you're yourself. I weighed myself on your scale during your show. I'm 75. That's right. He's a tall man. Get out of here. You weigh the weight. He weighs 175. Sure. Maybe the 75 part of it. We may care in carpet or look like a. Blimp. You know, he wears those baggy clothes. So it makes it what's ever done. I think it must all be in his back. I'm asked for something 170. If I'm inside. There's lead balls. I weigh like 189. Okay. And I'm a tub. I'm a big fat old Jew. Are you kidding? You were 170. I'm like, what? 5253. 59. Okay. 5255.

The melting fives are placed to take mom. You're not taking your mom to the melting pot. You took Josh Cortis there. But mom. No. Right. She probably wouldn't appreciate it anyway. She's probably her taste is in her toks. But if you have any kind of taste at all, the melting pot is a memorable four-course dining experience. You dip in all kinds of fantastic things, man. All those delicious melting pot dipping sauces. You start to dine around with melting pots for now. Cheese fondue served with three different braids. Your granny Smith apples and crisp veggies. Just dip them in duck them in there. Watch that cheese dribble down your chin like that pepper only juice. Next, you choice the salads all with the melting pots homemade dressings. And then the on-phrase include lobster filet, man. You're on shrimp, cage and season chicken pork. Portable or shroom is duck and lots more cooked in oil or broth and then to top all of this off. And like I said, take your time. Okay. Because it's a major dining experience. Take your time when and out space it out.

This audience, America, they have no interest in these things. You know, and the only reason Steven Culver, that thing, got to have big deals because of where he is from. That's the reason. It's just like the Daily Show. It's good as it is. It is. You know, people watch it because it's sat there and humor. That's why. Well, there you go.

Blanned. 635, 0 on here for the most beautiful place in North America. Kauai, Hawaii. I got to go see that. 145 before I die. I got to see Kauai. Fank Hoover, 79. They're all smoking a big one there.

Yeah, let's still live. Tom Beach, bunch of plastic A holes. I'll say it again with a lot of money. Adorond X51, the Grand Canyon, 49. Niagara Falls, 47. Once you've seen it though, you know, there's the wife's museum there. And there's a bunch of other tourist traps. It's something like the Grand Canyon. I'm glad that those are right side by each because it's kind of thing you should see once. As opposed to like other really fantastic places in the world, if we did a worldwide like the Colosseum, you'll call a saline room. You can see that a thousand times, I never get tired of looking at it and walk in by it and sniff it and thinking about two beds and kill a lot more Christians there in the air. I'm from the Alliance. That's where the Romans really blew it. That's what I hear. Niagara Falls, 47. Glacier National Park Montana, 41. George says it's a great. I only been to Shelby, Montana. Yeah, that's not great. That's correct. Like a giant cattle pasture where they were. Lake Tahoe, 30 years old, they all had orange hair. And they all looked like the books do.

I came through out of the tax where that last. Oh, Grand Teton National Park Wyoming, none. Grand Teton, I don't think we can say that. And Newbury Port Mass, none. And we, thanks Eric, Eric Spelder, right, but don't say Mass. So that's where you know where it is. How about Cape Cod? Cape Cod. Let's get that on her right away. I'll tell you something ugly. There's a rosy in any state. She's ugly. She said, in a human state or a subhuman state. But what a cow. Oh my god. What a big fat obnoxious, pushy bull like. She makes me sick. Here's something that's going to cheer everybody up though in this crowd. When we did the polio label, what they wanted her most in the show, we should have put bush bashing. Do you think it would be a lot of votes? What, Georgia, learn about the factions. Oh. I don't know. I don't really like that. Bush flashing would've got a Zillion votes or at least. But, turn the man. What's that, many? President Bush's job of providing his fondness, lowest mark of his presidency. According to the new Harrison Ractive, poll today, every day there's a new poll every day, keeps going down. Keep still, even can't he? Well, it's never went down this often. Of a thousand three US adults surveyed the telephone for 29% Think Mr. Bush is doing an excellent or pretty good job. Men's a men's. Down from 35% if on significantly lower than the 43 in January, appropriating for Congress, all of a, also sank in, outstanding 18% for your Republican dominated Congress. Roughly a quarter of US adults say things in the country are going to write to Russian while 69% of Jewish say things have pretty seriously gotten off on a wrong track. And he's definitely worth it getting off on a wrong track, Jewish. He's been a trans in January when 33% of the nation's said was heading in a right direction. It recommends a key concern for the general public as 28% of Americans said it considered a right to be one of the two top most important issues. Let's see another one. I am a nation debate. 16% of Americans considered it a top issue down from 19 last months, but still sharply higher than 4% in March. The Harris poll comes two days after a downbeat assessment of Bush and a New York Times CBS news poll. And of course, keep in mind, this poll was taken before the US say today's bill to be in yesterday about all this, uh, even dropping it's going on. The NSA, the NSA, the NSA, the NSA, the NSA before they has spilled that. So if anything, it's going to keep going lower and lower. And then when it starts having a minus in front of it, then you know the public isn't quite as stupid. They just slow. Maybe then I've done it just a little slow. All the way to anything dumb is a compliment. Happy Friday says this fact from a very, very chronic. Oh, yes, Russell again chronic. Well, this is a chronic in Cocoa. Saying Hawaii is in North America is accurate as saying there's no national guard. No, I hate to break the news to it, but because Hawaii is part of the US, it's technically we can call it part of North America.

Patterson throughout his professional career called him a kind of a stranger. Redsmith and New York Times sports com is called him a man of peace who loved the fight. He won heavyweight title twice, knocking on Archie Moran, Ingabar Jo Hansen. He lost a twice defending it successfully seven times in fail three times to regain it.

Why in the world don't they have courtesy of the mad dog show? Outside of the day, Curtis is not on to a PM anymore. WQM programming sucks. That's so really correct. I think they don't like Curtis. He's not part of the of fraternity is what it is. He's not Jewish. He's not one of our Clintons boyfriends. And as a result, he only gets the only throw on a token bone every now and then. And he keeps throwing it back. For the polio, somebody have a great tonjie. We can't say Sam. Thanks a lot, Sammy. See we get some new idiots. I mean, maybe see some of the old ones of different names. Who cares? I like the way he spelled Joseph Gaki. Thanks, Sam. Your sanity. Got it. National Park. Got it.

Dude, what up with you on my way? Thirty pounds. I don't know. I just find it. I find it shocking. I don't know. When you know people and they're skinny and usually assume they're like 140 pounds. So can we then become to find out? I just don't understand that. See, Tommy isn't really skinny, but you've seen him in the context of this building where everyone is fat. Yeah. Is that what it is? I'm not going to tell Robert. Right. I see. So, Robert's his brother's a fat, but he's not. Actually, yeah, oh, my relative's our fat. Yeah, well, so they're Americans, haven't I? Apparently so.

See there, there are certain things in South Florida that people think, you know, like pizza and sub sandwiches. They just, I don't know what it is, but they don't make them like they do in New York and Boston. You know what I'm saying? What he said? Hobbies grinders, whatever you want to call man or anything like Boston. Oh, God, just to die for. The fallout was swift and fierce boys and girls outraged customers. A lot of no just one information was taken and how it was used after USA today reported yesterday that telephone companies supply the records of tens of millions of Americans to the NSA, lawmakers called for investigative hearings and said the controversy could complicate the White House efforts to win Senate confirmation of her Air Force General Michael Hayden and CIA director. Her group of Tussles, President Bush seeking to deflate mounting criticism defend it as domestic intelligence programs saying intelligence agencies fiercely protect the personal information of Americans. Right. But that provided little solace to those who think they promised he's been seriously violated. Jason Blank 25 of Sunrise said, people should be scared of it. We don't know what they know, what they're using those numbers for. You go, Jason. Not everybody was upset, however, for me it really doesn't matter because it doesn't look everything the heights had long, trun on whole 21 a biology major at FAU and Boca sounds like some kind of a hold to me. I like that. Long train on whole. I don't have anything to hide. Oh that's good. That's a good excuse. So let's just give up all our rights because we got nothing to hide. What a jackass, long. What a long jackass. Quarney USA today where we only know that. Verizon did that yesterday. Bush denied mining or trolling. I like I said the other day he looks like a definitely an old troll. I take it from this old troll. I know when I see it. I can smell it all. Trouff a million miles away. Old troll. And he's always got 20 introduced. He's always got that kind of more whimsical than ever. I confused the zero in the headlights to look on his face. Yeah, it's the medic. Is this going to help? Just going to have no, not helping you down to 29% Bozo. You double, you butcher, you lunatic, you maniac. And all that crap. Well, well, here's the president after all. Good, good for him. I got the OG story. Did you see that? No. You're going to puke your guts out when you hear this. You are absolutely a view eating anything yet? No, it's on its way though. Oh, I'll out in Cuba. What is that? Makara Alculta. La Luna. What is that? Error, you're talking about it. Daily, Joe. The occult's face. Oh, they're together. Daily, those said they're out in Cuba. I think it was some kind of a gay thing. Not that there's any of those people in Cuba you understand. No, they all came up. They all moved to South Florida. This is a new Roger.

In a scene from his new candid camera program, Juist. OG Simpson pulls a prank involving the infamous white bronco, draw criticism from the family of the man who was accused of killing. The accused my ass. As part of the paper, we show Simpson pretends to sell the bronco to use carlots and both to a perspective by the e-mailed vehicle famous. According to a segment aired Thursday on inside edition. It was good for me and helped me get away Simpson said refer to these slow speed televised police days that preceded his 94 arrest. I'm charges of murdering his ex-loctical and her husband, her friend, the way her whatever, Ryan Goldman. Goldman's father Fred told inside edition. He found Simpson's comment, morally reprehensible. Well, Simpson is morally reprehensible. So why should he be talking like some kind of a mentor, right? Right. Like some kind of a civilized human being. In fact, when I asked him, remember the human being's name of that song? When I asked him who killed those people said nobody about me. That was by the human being's one of it. Right. See how these are all fit to get to you following this or not? I don't think so. Yeah. Criminal trial.

Not a single solitary dime. And that's because probably Greg and his scurram were busy getting his next trip all set up to our studio all the way from Kimble. That is one of the days that we'll live in broadcasting infamy, man. When they wished his ass and they paid a flyman from the west coast to flyman for the Neil Rogers fundraising government after assuring me that promising me that they were gamut and done the do with him. Remember that? I'm sure you know what we just did today. Even saved that memo. Yeah. And then they tried to make Tracy Curacita who was there for about five minutes until he was under their lies and BS. They tried to make him the fall guy. Oh, you're going to have to take the fall for this. And he said, no thanks. I'm out of here. I still am Tracy. Any money that he makes a hopeful go to satisfy the multimillion dollar judgment against him in a civil case. Exactly. And they treated me as Gloria all red. The lady and all red. The hour long program is airing on paper view this month. Oh, I'm sure that everybody in their brother is going to. I know some people paid a watch it. Paper, Greg, screw in. Some, and of course the water not see. She's still there. They find to get her ass out of there. No, she still love red around. But she's still there. They're there to the wall.

Juiced executive producer Rick March, older A&P. Other practical service includes Simpson disguises an Elvis impersonator, a vagabond selling oranges for money, an elderly man leading a bingo game. Simpson wasn't paid for the program, Mar said, basically OJ decided to do this because he wants to do it. He wanted to have fun with it, Mar said, didn't get paid for the program. Do you believe that? They probably pay him out of the table. Because otherwise you don't get part of the way to the Goldman's and the Brown's and the Greens. Pretty green. You just to pitch for the pirates. OJ, just you just can't get rid of him, man. This can't get rid of him, although there's one way comes to mind. We'll care for next time. I hopped into Bronco.

The suit plans that Civilist got free time because of Stern used the CBS airways to vote his move to the satellite network. The suit plans during stood again financially at the Series of Scrabber based group and the payments team were accelerated because of his honor mentions while at CBS. Let me say it again. They couldn't take him off the year any time they wanted they didn't do it. They wanted the money. The parties are expected to let the judges know by Wednesday whether or not they've settled a case. But they're all going to be on the satellite. They're making a deal. The owner no deal. And speaking of radio, the next fight, the ongoing battle over in D.C. defines could happen next week on the floor of the U.S. Senate day. The bill sponsored by the unshusty right wing lunatic senator Bramma Brassam Brownbacker Kansas. His back on the table will be likely voted on next week by a Senate committee. This bill would multiply court in D.C. defined amounts by tenfold with the maximum jumping from 30,500 to 325 grand. And a few things choices we press have now just wait. We just wait until they do put this thing through. We won't even be able to say that. Not even the word much less snif one. Other indecency bills have been floating around the house instead of for the parents for years since the 2004 Super Bowl in Janet Jackson's nipple gate incident. In fact, just last week there were reports of a new push behind the house version of the bill led by Senator Bill Fist. However, that moved the hotline below the situation with block. No indecency legislation has been stymied by Senate Congress Committee Chairman the U.S. Ted Steans of Alaska, who stayed in the past and prefer families and individuals pleased what they see in here, rather than using higher broadcast fines. What a concept. However, sources tell the L.A. times that the bill will go before the Senate Congress Committee for a vote next through the May 18. Oh, we get a chance to vote on it because that's a big we get off early. I'll take the pink eye out to L.A. Conservator organizations have a lot of the extensively for higher indecency fines and seems certain they're working payoff. Once it's on the floor and a lot of be voted, I'm sure we're going to win. Tom Akuski of the U.S. Family Research Council told the L.A. Times. The family research council. Much of our business in the right wing going to think that they're going to decide what you can hear, what you can read and everything is so dirty. In what could signal a frightening new factor of life? Oh, my God. The age of global warming Canadian U.S. Forecastes are warning that another major hurricane season is brewing in the Atlantic Ocean. Oh, that's the last thing we need to hear isn't it? Yeah. And I bet you there's a whole lot of people that still are putting their ants back together from Wilma, including me. There's a lot of blue tarps up there. Yeah. So, we're going to have the apathy of screen yet. The pool patio, the screen in the end. The 2006 hurricane season officially opens June 1, which is not that far away. In fact, the summer schedule judge is not that far away. I hope you got a lot of good poll ideas for this summer. No, I'm not. I'm thinking of a lot of good poll ideas. No, but they've nothing to do with the show. But let's see, the season opens officially June 1 already scientists are telling people living in North America that numerous storms are predicted with as many as five, made your hurricanes packing winds in 180 miles an hour or greater. Are you like that? A risk. Kind of comfortable to what we were looking at last year. This time said Bob Brober Show, a meteorologist with the Canadian hurricane set of Endarmouth Nova Scotia. Last year we were looking at probably 15 storms. And this year the forecast is from about 17. No one would want to limit it. It's just going to be as bad as last year. But the indications are that it's going to be another active season almost twice as active as normal. Could be that global warming could have. Now, couldn't be.

How come nobody said like some exotic place in the South Pacific. We're our pool because that's not North America. Right. Like Hawaii in the South. There would be like saying Hawaii. Hawaii is not in the South Pacific. Okay. What have we said? You tell me Hawaii is in the South Pacific. Hawaii is right smack in the middle of the Pacific. Right. That's out of us. Well. Take a look at him and take a look at him. Take a look at him. Okay. Here it is. A Thai entrepreneur has launched an internet radio station to put dogs in a better mood. Thailand starts dog radio station when I started headline club. We should get up at those in this market. Like across the street. Anapen Bunchen director of a dog room in school city launched dog radio Thailand this week because he has seen music improved the mood of dogs he grooms. That's something. During class the turns on music for the dogs because the music puts the dogs in a good mood. And they're more willing to let the groomers handle them. He said. The programming on dogwadyotaland.com. Mainly comprises Thai pop music for Bunchen Pants to expand offerings of which the district. He will talk to the dogs in Thai and the keen iron listener will be encouraged to respond. I wonder if they bark in Thai. At 9 a.m. we may have a dog reading show which will repeat. Sawasdee which means hello over and over and Sawasdee. Sawasdee if we say Sawasdee and some houses. The dog may lift both paws and response. And some houses the dog may lift only one paw. It depends on the dog was trained and upon said. That's in the sick. He said if we play a slow song we may have the DJ howl because dogs howl too when they hear a sad song. That's something. I think we hear the music they play on magic a lot of people howl. Sorry Ricky but you know it's true. I thought it happened to the movie. We don't get 900 by the top of the hour. I'm leaving. We got 813 right now. Agency rejects Tripod. Dr. Pilexto main name.

Oh I don't know what to do it. Face with opposition from conservative groups in some pornography websites. Let me just take a look. I know I printed that out. Maybe I'm losing my mind. Think that's possible. Oh no. Maybe I already smith candid. That's very possible too. Face without opposition from conservative groups in some pornography websites. The internet's key oversight agency voted Wednesday to reject the proposal to create a red light district on the internet. But a season from the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers reverses its preliminary approval last June to create a dot XXX domain name for voluntary use by the entertainment industry. Now you know in Amsterdam on the polls they have a what they call those things those posts they have on the street. Yeah. Light posts. No not land posts not that high just those what they call those and things they like a rail or is a. I don't what they call but anyway XX is like the symbols kind of thing do it sex by the way. Amsterdam surprisingly enough. You know the red divasoline what does it say for I don't know. I can that's international corporate sign in yeah at postball making the final decision. August after the last government step in just days before scheduled meeting to underscore objections that had received an intervention that had led some I can. Critics to question the organizations independence. The board was certainly very conscious of the controversy but the heart of the decision that it was not driven by political consideration. Icon chief executive Paul Tumis and interview that follow more than our discussion and a closed teleconference meeting. The decision largely came down to whether creation of XX might put Icon and difficult position of having to force all of those laws governing pornography. It's only once that might require porn sites to use the domain. Speak for later laws you know often conflict with one another. Well you know there is no more free speech in America anyway so just just make it. It doesn't even don't even ask. He said concerns raised by various governments around the world did prompt the company proposing the domain. I see and we're just re-ink of Jupiter Florida to make changes in its bid but the changes did not address all the questions concerning enforcement. Icon's rejection of dot triple X and nine to five oh ends for now a six year old I heard by I see and to establish a domain for the porn industry. I can first table it's been 2000 out of fear it will be getting into content control. When the board initially go to vice you to move forward with the dot triple X to contract the tail said you have to be written. They argued that a main would help the $12 online porn industry to clean up a check. Those using the domain would have to abide by it to be written rules designed to bar such trick reassuming and malicious scripts. Anti-point advocates are ever counted out to science and be free to keep their current dot com address and making porn more easily accessible by creating yet another channel to house it and the audio audio. Democratic senators max voccus of Montana and Mark Pirb Arkansas have introduced legislation to create a mandatory dot triple X. Leave it to those democrats man the point industry trade group free speech coalition please a domain name for kids probably says to be more appropriate. Yeah kitty point. And for kid friendly science. There you go more repression see all these people I'm going to say it again just like on our website. It's just it just tears your guts out and no surprise but just tears your case he's out anyway. Yeah and you have some nerve to knock that guy on for a long day. And for a long day like fact isn't worn us we probably all be in jail right now. We're going to stop putting those naked pictures on our website. And for that he released it to the new law the winner effect like last June or whatever. And a minute we stop putting the be the curtain on there with the naked pictures the daily response on our website dropped in half. 50% man 50% just almost vanished because all they want to see they don't care about these great stories that we put on there. They're not interested in all this crap. And about what really happened in 911 or about what the Stephen Colbert said about how Bush is a Dodo bird. They don't care they want to see naked pictures. That's right that is correct. That's all I care about. I'm thinking if we just had if we had a website with only naked pictures we get 10 times the response we get in our video without any. Correct. In fact if I could speak naked pictures instead of speaking English we get we have a 40 we have a 90 sure booby ass. But don't look at me. I'm done that's you done. That's the only thing we can say. Can you kidding me? Weiner. We got that. She got another weiner. 827 vote on him. Keep in mind that baby I don't want to fall short of a thousand and a Friday that would be bad.

McQun said yes In America there was a rational assessment saying listen If we give these people freedom right as they are You're going to have to go back and see how they were You can't assume that they were like us JR asked how were they? They were coming out of the generals he said They had been enslaving each other for centuries in Africa And in terms of being used to rule of law, they knew none of that No doubt about Winston McQun has controversial opinions But through his views making him the classroom he teaches Latin At Brooklyn Casey he told JR, JR Barry who wrote this That most of his students are white JR asked, is this something that enters your classroom Something that you tell your students? I'm a Latin teacher, so I'm not teaching politics of history Said McQun, I'm just teaching Latin We got off subject one day and he mentioned that slavery happened And he mentioned the vice president about Andrew Jackson's time And that's how we got off on slavery that I've created Candace Carroll said The vice president she was referring to is John C. Calhoun Someone Winston McQun admires John C. Calhoun agreed to South Curling me in terms of political understanding and wisdom McQun said, and he argued that the institution slavery was a positive good And he called it a great good and it was good Now what God was saying, it led a big good I think it was not about poor love Oh, they don't let Ryan Jeremy and South Curlana Before talking with us, McQun no Jews McQun posted his views on internet website called American Renaissance Most of the comments on the site were aimed at blacks McQun's comments are no exception For instance, last August McQun said There's no positive we made for blacks slavery in America Why should today's whites of politics for the wisdom of their ancestors JR commented in McQun there will be some people who say that those are racist remarks They can call them what they will said McQun But if they call it racist, I just say it's true and you've got to deal with that I have a responsibility to speak to truth I believe it is This is a guy in South Carolina by the way, if anybody believes that the civil war Sob the anti-man you're dreaming you're in a lot of lads right Let's get on that damn canoe and head on the Aintree The anti-Cohua lost his river The B&TI, the banjo, boy grouping JR asked if he had that black students in your class You looked down and then no said McQun I tried to the best I can with every student I've got JR asked but you just said they were inferior to try to actualize whatever potential is their McQun said This isn't the first time Winston McQun's been in the news In 1999 he was a history teacher saying Josie private high school in Greenville, South Carolina He on her Confederate flag in his classroom When parents complained he was told by school officials to take it down He didn't even as fired did it Our board of trustees ran screaming in the night saying take it down Take it down and refuse because you need to present different views in the classroom McQun said That was seven years ago Today a damn university graduate has been a straightive leave after news 19 informed Lexington District to about his comments he won't be back next year But he wasn't coming back anyway because of a certification issue Though the district declined on on camera interview they didn't issue the fall while they should Some statement While McQun's days from the woods lexington to our numbered McQun says his time in the classroom is far from over Is that a problem he says I hope not and might not supposed to make a living because of my views or should I just be wiped out or what and people like me What do you think I think you're a redneck if I said I think you part of America's redneck problem America's got a big fat redneck problem Anyplace South of like Pennsylvania And even some parts of the North like in Taylor, Michigan and Detroit Which is on the other one of our rednecks with a big big economy size you're a vastly non top of the TV set Boy you got to see Taylor Michigan and you want to see rednecks Yeah, these are the people I won't let in the trailer park I've been through me She can have you I'm talking about Taylor Michigan after west of Washington although there's some pretty hot weed places in Michigan I don't have to get around Jackson Michigan there's some pretty hot weed places there 909 Jackson Hardest Raceway right up from Jackson State prison and a lot of those drivers by the way ought to be in prison 916 votes.

And coming soon for her, it's the lady confusion, specifically designed for bronze. 132 of QM so speaking of a few confusion, now I haven't seen some razor. I'm just, you know, I tried that one and the whole vibrating thing all of the crap. I believe the vibrators do a Josh Cortis. But I would say that I got a little bit of Gillette Fusion shaving cream. If you try that, it's blue. Alright. Oh, it's good stuff for the carts. It's really good. It's just sheer that stuff. It's just blue stuff to smear. It's stuff for you that is green right now. But anyway, now what's this new piece of copy for next week? Oh my god, can you imagine that from Fred Boy? That's bad news, you wonder why? In the case he's still alive. Yeah, very bad news. Is still weird. Do you see it? Do you see it? Oh, god. Boy says jail would make a great president. There's the chuckle for the weekend. Okay, just keep yuckin' it up over that. Oh yeah, that's what I want to say about it. Could there be a third president push I want to do this yesterday, but I never got around with it. But we will today. The current president said Wednesday that younger brother jail would make a great president that asked him about making a run. The first president pushed daddy like the idea too. Audio like that. All the bush all the time. Jamb Boy's favorite public in Governor of Florida has won as said his president subruder doesn't right now. Approval from most of his constituents. That's because he's got all those devious plans and he's a lion's second cramp. And Florida likes that. What's George W is a approval ratings are well 29 right now in Nationalite. Some 55% of Florida voters are made last month. I couldn't be at the University of San Jeff doing a heck of a job. Brownie Han, heck of a job. 55% is that say there's no hope for Florida? Absolutely. The governor has repeatedly said he won't be a candidate for president in 2008. But that doesn't stop his family from encouraging him to go for it someday. I'd like to see Jeff run at some point in time. But I have no idea if his intention or not the president said and we would afford to be porters when he was in time the other day. He said his brother would make a great president that he had pushed him fairly hard about what he intends to do. I truly don't think he knows where to say it. Jeff 53 will end his second term as Governor in January. Thanks God. His brother George ends it all. And his second presidential term in January 2009. Can we make it that long? No. I don't think so. The governor got to build up from his brother on the same day. The governor has a bad news out of Tallahassee when Alan Bensit, the ink and a challenge Catherine Harris that they chained out of a gentleman's chance in hell against Bill Nelson. She got two chances much, much, much less than none. And the zipo ever used a zipo lighter? Sure. Oh, it's several. What are you letting it with? I didn't have anyone vote on the poll. I know you don't want to answer the question. You're letting it with. No. What are you letting with it? Oh, you know. Stop. Stop. Stop. Marijuana. Not with a zipo lighter. It's even Tommy don't go for that. It does. It does. It does leave a bad taste. That's only for going on. Yeah, you get all that the get taste of gas. It's like going like, like sucking the gas out of your tank and you should don't want to do that now. That's good for bugs. So I'm psyching and gas out. You know, you got like, well, I never in 74 votes on the poll. Let's take a few get it. Okay. What is the most beautiful place in North American countries? I don't know. It's a little awkwardly. Whatever we had to do that because of the new pickers out there. It didn't want Hawaii to be included. Well, you know what? Too bad. I like Hawaii. Just too crowded on a wahoo. And crowded too many people. Yeah, they never hear a filthy word of status. Klai, Hawaii. Well, you are man. You just. Three said after all these years. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you. I'm talking about that thing. You got that Spanish thing. Have a Spanish thing. That's what I heard. That's what Duff told me. Klai, Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii, 184. Big Sur, 93. Vancouver, 90. Well, look at that. Vancouver's beauty has never been there. Sudan, Faray. Grand Canyon 86. Tahoe 67. Palm Beach, Florida 66. What's the big semis in Palm Beach? What did I miss? Maybe you didn't go to the right places. Oh, I seen it. As a matter of fact, when I worked at WJ and almost Palman 1975, some friends in mind, they're their friends. Worked for some of this very rich family. I had this big mansion in Palm Beach. And of course, mostly, very wealthy people in Palm Beach, they go away for many. A lot of them really live like in those places for like a few weeks out of the year. You know what I'm saying? What he said? So it's empty the rest of the year. He used that mansion many, many, many of the time. It had some real drug and celebrations in their big saltwater pool and right across the street in the ocean. And just, Palm Beach was fine. But it's beautiful. And around that 63, glacier national park bond, 10, 53. Now you're talking. Niagara Falls 53. Alaska 36. Like he keeps it for why, 31. Should be way higher than that. Even just diamond head alone. You know what else is really neat to see his north shore. You're going to carve when you go to Hawaii and you drive up to north shore. I'm writing this down. And you see all the surfers up there in North Shore. All them fag, all them surfers. Savannah, Georgia 31. What is the fag element of that surfing thing? Can you tell me what that's all about? I guess it's just a bunch of naked guys with surfboards. Almost naked. Yeah, that's it. Okay. Smoking. Yeah, I think he'll tell you. When you go out to dinner this weekend, ask him the deaf mice for she'll tell you. San Diego 20. Oh, my, I skipped over smoking mountains 27 grand. I was going to do that. That was a 40 in the morning. That was a 40 in the morning. That was a 40 in the morning. That was a 40 in the morning. You're a 70 11. Why do we have to put California after San Diego? Don't people know where that is? Cape caught 11. Victoria B. C. 10. See that we needed. Augusta National Six. Testgate mountains Washington. Five. Couple of sandwiches for Redwood National Park 3. Catalina Island 2. And a newberry poor Massachusetts one. That's what I got to call it in. Because nobody ever heard of that. I still know where it is. I probably went to Google that I probably should read about it. Should I? They get nice too. Maybe it's really nice there. I still say Cape caught pretty nice. And Boston A2Bab and they're having decent weather. I'm not sure which day's it is. You're that is not too much anymore. Really bad weather in Boston. WDQAM. Hello. QAM. Hola. Hello. Hello. Yes.

They don't have a number. They got a number all right. It's got a zero in front of it. I think I'll think it up. I'll read the narrative. You may go. Don't be talking to filthy Hispanic. Right. So anyway, car mail. Oh, they get that on the right away. That is. Have you ever driven through there? No. The West Coast Highway. The old Hershey Highway up the West Coast. Man, that is just incredible. What you saw playing this before me? That's right. That's all you need to see. It's going to be smooth. And then I'm sure you saw the way he was coming up the records too. Right. backwards and draw. Every movie that's kind of easy to do with radio. Right. I don't know what. I mean, how difficult would it be to have like a consultant that actually was once in a radio station saying, hey, when this doc he's cue up records back when we played records, they don't just stick to needle on the disk, you know. Right. But the pot. It's so stupid, man. I think that's where it was kind of what's your name. I didn't say we see really cause the same voice. 980. 880 votes on the poll.

A desk out and share records reports, tens of millions of cookies there aseres phone calls are in the SS, shortly after the Youtube 1 tour index case. request to the communications CEO Joseph Natsyu, I wonder if he's came to Ralph Natsyu. Natsyu. Broke ranks with fellow former bell companies. He broke ranks. When he learned that no such authority had been granted, that there was a disconnect inclination on the part of the authorities to use any legal process, including the special core which had been established and as much matter as much as possible. Mr. Natsyu concluded that these requests violated the privacy requirements of the telecommunications act as a turning-run estate man. In other words, ill-eagle. Natsyu agreed with questions to turnies that surrendering its customers' quality tail records to the NSA was wrong, a. Quest bought to the request and pressure from the NSA with that to your report. It would be deeply troubled by the implications of the reports. Current CEO Richard Note or Noteabart, Halston talks to the NSA land in 2004 after the two couldn't agree on the details. It says no way was it. Good for Quest, huh? They didn't give a big kiss. That's what I'm saying. Not for Richard Quest, though, because he makes me nauseous. He's got donkey teeth and probably donkey breath. He's a Brit. You received a question you soon. Yeah, I'm not sure if it's a question. Not a long time, though. Thank goodness. It's kind of like every now and then. It's like the BanjoBord Group Incorporate. We've got to be a way to try to find people with the most annoying voices and put them on here. And the same thing too, with the CNN. The most uncle's, like, two are Phillips, not a voice, but just just her. Just as a being. Oh, God. 996 vote. Any second now, we're going to tip over to that thousand and then we can all take a deep sigh of relief. We did it again and again and again and again, just amazing how we keep doing this. First of all, when most of the audience has gone, you know, coming this is, you think we got left now, the new regime came in. Not third in there. Yeah, yeah, this you're out of the dare doing. We got a lot of spots. We have no audience. See, I think the goal is from the new regime is we have like one spot for each listener. That's the sort of words. Well, let's see, 16 an hour times four. So that's 64 spots on the show and four hours. So I mean, one for each listener, 64 listeners. I think we got that. I have two to four. I don't think they can match that. Even Tommy was overwhelmed by that when he found out that we had a 0.5. I'm a three o'clock hour right there in the middle of the daytime when people are awake. I'm in station. Can you believe that? He leave? No, he's right here. Just not so. I'm sure you can talk about the season such a state of shock. But do you, or you could care less? Yeah, could. Could you care less? Yeah. Yeah. He says more, more or less. Anyway, just I mean, a 0.9 and two o'clock, that's bad enough because at least they're still suffering. Some of you people are listening now. I'm a show. But a tree o'clock, it's like man, like like at evacuation. I mean, you can almost smell it. Like a terror alert. Like a bomb scare. Oh, don't turn that dial on there, man. You're going to die between three and four. A 0.5. That is. That's scandalous is what it is. And the fact that these people are still, you know, even the hump or made a comment about that this morning, they're still didlin' and didlin' and dolin' and they haven't got a clue. Although George said in his secret meeting with the pie pie for the other day, those are the clon that they have some plans. And what you said? Right. They don't know what they are, and they're not telling them whatever, but they got some plans. Probably for dinner. The United States again has refused the international committee of the Red Cross, access to terrorism, suspects, health and secret detention centers, the humanitarian agency be seen today. The overnight statement was issued after toss of Washington between ICRC President Jacob Kellon Burger, and senior officials including Secretary of State Condo Leezer Rice, the fence secretary Hermann Gary Rumsfeld, and National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. Mr. Kellon Burger deployed the fact that the U.S. authorities had moved closer to granting the ICRC access to persons held an undisclosed locations, the Geneva-based agency said, and know that it's not an even New York in WGVA. Kellon Burger says no matter how legitimate the grounds for detention, there exists no right to conceal a person's verabouse, or deny that he or she is being detained. The former swish swish diplomat said the ICRC would continue to seek access to such people's rhetoric. We've just received a negative response again. Again, they be seen. The agency recognized the legitimate grounds for voting for terrorism suspects supposed to threat to the U.S., but it is absolutely vital for such people to be held in a clear, legal framework, but not with a bush grab, and they just make them disappear. They just show away nobody receives them no more. Is that the way it works? It's a lower tier, a hard work. Yeah, and more. War on all your freedoms, man, and war against all civilized people.

Everything in their power to make sure it fails, which is why I'm personally I'm going to come down to a lot, not to the studio, but just to go there and lose my ass and make my contribution to slots.
