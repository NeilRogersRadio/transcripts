It's Friday, you best still. Coming soon to a cinema near you. It's the greatest romantic comedy in the history of film. You grant is a fumbling twit. Well, if I may, I hope I'm not being too forward. The London Times is a fumbling twit is so life-like that no more film should ever be made. As they would only palen comparison to this brilliant piece of twit headed type casting. If I may be so bold as to ask you and understand that I'm trying to track it by standing here in the middle of the street. But I'm very much like to ask you. It is the only one you grant movie this year. Then you certainly won't need to see this one because he's playing the exact same twit he plays in all his movies. I'm glad that you did it with me. Well, there's something I've been meaning to say. It's a nice to be quite fetching. You think Elizabeth Hurley left him because of that? Hold the vine, Browndale? No, she left him because she's a fumbling twit. Now playing in selected cities. I do rather hope you'll come to see me in a fumbling twit. That is to say if you don't mind my being somewhat cheeky. Oh, for love, oh God, what you shot! Oh, well, all right then, I suppose. Yeah, I'll tell you what he is and one word annoying is what he is. Does he have any talent? No, it does. He looked good. He's annoying. Look at that. We got 500 votes on the poll today. Man, our goal is 501. We don't want to set our goals too high on the day. If you're Thanksgiving on Black Friday, when everybody's out shopping. We're just playing all these today. We're playing the rack. Although we have some issues to take here. First, we got Larry Cochars going to get fired in the less than an hour. What are you laughing about? You don't know that? How much you want to bet? You think because they finally want a game and they may get an invite to the toilet ball and he's going to keep his job six and six. See, this is what I don't understand about college football. They went, they lost six freaking games. And they're eligible for a ball game? What does that all about? They suck. But nevertheless, how about those dolphins, baby? Just what I knew it. I predicted it and just as predictable as the day is long man. Oh, yeah. They're going to run the table and they're not going to play against any team that really looks insurmountable. Let me ask you this. What team would be insurmountable? Unbeatable. What team would that be? Because they're saying it's not the goals. Then who'd that would it be? Well, maybe the coach was still undefeated. What team and league right now could they not beat? Under any circumstances, unbeatable by anybody. There isn't any. Am I right? That's correct. But they got to be Jacksonville in the Patriots, which there's no chance of that. None. And the Colts, which there's no chance of that. And then at Buffalo, which Buffalo is very good, but they got to play at Buffalo. But hey, we got four in a row, baby. We're talking so favorable. That's right. Good. Be a good fan. You know, we're for your team and live in a dream world. But nevertheless. So on Wednesday, we had the ratings come out to trends. And wow, wow, that morning show. They just kind of took a crap shoot with that. And like, let's put some runner and hope that it flies, you know. Put some fly stick to what end of it. And it is. It's a nice set number there in a morning in October. And Barry Jackass has got a glowing article about Kimbo Bo Kamper and about our morning show. And we'll get to that. I'm not going to read stuff other than that. Well, maybe a couple of other things. I just can't stop. Like, Mo would say, I can't stop. Is that what he would say? That's what he says. No. How come you're such a schmuckmo? Well, I just can't stop. How come you're such an A whole? Well, the answer is. I can't stop. Yeah. Anyway, so speaking of people who get fired, university, my me present Donna Shilily. That, like, high level U.M. officials and board of trustee members are holding a meeting right now as we speak. That, discuss, let me co-chorus future, which likely it says according to the Harold is already decided. It's widely expected that the Cocoro be fired this morning, although he wasn't at the meeting. The final decision being made by Mr. Shilily. At the 11 A.M. news conference, which usually served for Cocoro to give us day after the game. Comments, it's expected instead of the service announcement of his dismissal, it's believed that Jabba U.M. athletic director Paul D. will also come out of discussion. What do you like that? And I, I part of me for me to agree with anything that Eddie Pope has ever written, because he's an old code. But I would agree with what he wrote in the Herald today about. You have to get a shrink to want to have that job anyway? Or, I mean, that was a program where if you lose one game, they get all been out of shape and you're on the, and it lose six games. Forget about it. Go away old man. Larry Cocoro has done. He's, so we got the beast over there at U.M. of course, which basically it camps out there all the time anyway. That's where he sleeps. Another overgrown child. And so he's going to call Miguel Lidl, a little bit of clock and pass along the news, whatever the, whatever the, whatever the, Now, although we could care the press conference, but I guess we're not. Why not? If you want to. Well, we have a building do that. We got the ability to do everything. Well, I do that. I don't know what we do it. I don't want to put that crap on the area. You crazy. The U.M said Wednesday the 379 Iraqi civilians were killed in October, the highest monthly tolls since the Iraqi attack by the U.S. 30709. Wow. They're dying like flies. Anybody care? No. No. And of course, it's black Friday. This is something I never been able to understand as long as I've lived. It's been going on forever. And it gets worse every year. What, what does this all about? Everything has a hell of a discount. Does that what it's all about? Yeah. Everything is 50 to 75 percent off. Thousands of sufframatings kicked off in Andy or right of the holiday shopping season, black Friday this morning from a very long time. Friday this morning from a best buy and plantation, boy, try to get out of that parking lot and make a left turn. To a Walmart. To a, well, there should be a, like there, but it's, you know, going to take about five people getting killed. They're trying to make that left turn before they finally put a traffic light in there. You idiots. I'm Tony. I live right there for cloud. Oh, I'll during these three days you when I'm there. From a best buy and plantation of a Walmart and West Kendall German consumers got in line. Some as early as the night before Thanksgiving to ensure they get exactly what they came for. The night before Thanksgiving. And Kindle more than a thousand shoppers lined up outside Target and Walmart before dawn this morning. Many anxious load up on electronics. At a Walmart and West Kendall lines snaked around the store across the length of the huge parking lot all the way to McDonald's. I'm Kindle Drive. The store opened a few minutes before five this morning. And the store manager came outside and I shoppers to be courteous. Yeah. Right. This isn't South Florida and no less big courteous. With a couple of complete shoppers and streamed in the store in an orderly fashion making a beeline for place stations and intendos. Kendall resident I've been a strata 32. He came for a 52 inch flat screen TV. From $894 to $474 good to make that line set a strata beaming a few minutes after five am as he waited for a friend to help load the massive TV into his truck. He said it was worth the nine hour wait to be the first one to get a this. Oh. Oh. Woo. Well you folks have a good time. Okay. Better you than me. That's all I can tell you. I'm Black Friday. It's a day after Thanksgiving and it's they're just popping up the dough all over the place. How's that pull result coming from whatever we run last on Wednesday? 777 votes is all we got. And of course that's because you know what it was because of. And it was Thanksgiving. When you use the inward was the pull question never 199 you believe that. No. I don't believe there's anybody who never uses that word. But it's politically correct to say all I would never say that and it's the most offensive word. Okay. 199. If Dark folk say it themselves then it's okay but if a white he said it's really bad. And you're a racist in a big and a piece of crap and should die and hell. Only in the right company for the occasional joke but I'm not a racist on 39. When I see O.G. on TV 101. Hmm. Sometime in traffic 86. Sometimes in the shower when singing to myself woke up runs classic kiss a f***ing morning 65. Sometimes I'm watching the news 50. I hate this pull 48.7% and when referring to my close personal friends on Black 19. See it's okay for them to say it. Okay for you Black folk to say the inward but if a white person says it that's bad. Like I can say a f***ing if like a straight person says it that's a real schmere you know. That's a knock. And today's pull. Why can't we start diving into these bits because the bits and the hits are just going to keep on coming. See I used to work on Thanksgiving day being the schmuck that I am I'm an idiot. I have no idea why. But yesterday we had to go from pre game into post game in the real pre and post game and pre up. And after a very shaky start they beat the crap out of a little girl's team and I couldn't win a fixed game. And Joey Harrington baby goes back to the scene of the slime and gets booed and they all carry it on. And Nick Sabons says that's on a symptom old. Right right they hate him he sucks. What's your take on the callers is our pull today you see you didn't think I would do this did you. I thought you would. You did. Yeah. I better reach over and turn that monitor off. We're sure not taking any calls today. What's your take on the callers which I think maybe coming back on Monday and of course I'm going to leave this pull up all weekend. Because you know it's still Thanksgiving it's still a holiday weekend. Correct. So if we want to get a really scientific sampling we got to leave it on there long enough to get 8 million votes. What's your take on the callers a few calls would be okay 124 feet don't get carried away. Bring the calls back 162 with an explanation point bring a back you jackass. The show is fine without the calls only 73 13.7 percent. The callers suck 69 that's what I voted for it's 13 percent and I hate this pull only 4 that's 0.7 percent. That's like a number they had across the street in this last trend 0.7. By the way heck of a job Joel you're doing it baby. Joel fineburg and a crew over there to stew gods all those guys across the street you're doing a heck of a job. And of course I'm sure we don't really care. Wait tough I got to get that very jackass calm going. Well we know 161 people died in Iraq yesterday. I'm not going to do all that stuff. Former dolphin vocam per making mark on TV and radio. Is what the headline is and I'll get to that straight momentarily very jackass narrow thanks a lot Barry hey Barry. You're fairie obviously he's been talking to Kimba and Joe Bell and this one on that one yati adi. Finally the son to give us a little bit of press at a boy Barry. And basically the article the thrust of it is that Kim now has like developed a personality Kim who used to be as dull as a 10 year old razor blade. A real duller. What he laughing about you know it's true. Now all of a sudden he's like a. Dollars the only about a two year old razor blade. Good guy though, but done 10 13 at 5 60 WQM. It's fucked to our Friday you bested. And I have to send you. Yes, do you have a match? I think you like my shoe lace. When there's a bomb in my shoe and the melody in my heart. I get that you can take a dip in it. When I blow the flame apart to Joe Bell. Will that might be? Please be no such to Allah. Your life is worth taking for my religious reason why. With a bomb on my feet. I'll do it a once-front on your seat. And I'll do my lead. I'm an outsider. When there's a bomb in my shoe. I'll let Allah fill out. What a wonderful way to do. I hit that way. No, you see me. No, I'm a fool. I'm a fool. I'm a fool. So say no, Allah. No, no, no. I won't lie to you. Ten 18 at 5 60 WQM. Look at that. The mad dogs working today. That's what it says in my schedule. The answer you're on today or not. Sure. We don't know. We don't know because parents doesn't give us the real schedule anymore. It's kind of a, or like, stepchildren. Mad dog at Hooray's in Pompano. It says in my schedule. And the power hour with Hank in the mad dog. Either way. Why? Anyway. What? It's pine. It's either going mad dog or Curtis. But it's pine. It says Hooray's in Pompano. On my schedule. Yeah. What are you reading there for? I'm going to empower our four to five. Hank solo 5 to 7. I believe I'm just reading the schedule that I've got. Okay. That's all I can do because they don't send me the real revised one. Like when Mad dog was not early in the week. Panther people with 7, the Panthers are really stink of the joinout. They're against the Washington Senators. Who? All right. That's what it says in my schedule. There's the Washington Crapitals. But the Washington Senators at 7.30. Oh. Followed by the 80 Kaplan Show. I'm telling you, man, Curtis needs a, he needs a lobotomy. Somebody needs to squeeze his bag. His sack. There's something wrong with a child. So it's right here. The Florida Panthers against the Washington Senators. Oh, brother. That's funny. Woo. Oh, speaking of, uh, bombing my shoe. Just one more little piece of bad news from the Raktim will move on. Okay. I'm going to read that very jackass. Come, then we're going to dive into our whole library here in play stuff. Even that we're not supposed to play. Oh, right. Not. Oh. In other words, you think I should play all the stuff. And then I'll leave it up to you to dump all of it. Like, uh, my name is. Like that. But anyway, two bombs killed 22 people in northern Iraq today. As the government tried to tamp down on violence and hit off a civil war. Oh, yeah. Day after SUNY Urban Surgeons killed 250 people. And then attack on Baghdad, Sutter City slum. Then intensified. She had anger at the US. There it goes on. But it would be pretty good. But about every single day, there's a down like flies. We've created total mass chaos there. See, some people are barbaric and full of hate. And as we thought they needed good dictator, let keep everybody in line. Like we're a good old Sodom. 547 votes on a poll. What's the reasonable goal today? 750. The remiss show? 800. No chance. You're your dream and on the day I found Black Friday, 800 my ass. Don't forget, 11 o'clock, we're going to be getting that call from the beast. At least McGill will be. When I could, I'm not going to put him on the air. No. Because he'll probably have tears running down his fat face. Oh, gee, Larry, Coca, God fire all the kids. Grow up already. When you people are going to grow up. God, from the Mike Rosenfeld J. Rokeet School of being a professional, a professional, perpetual UM child. Anyway, very jackass in a hero says former dolphin boat camper making mark on TV and radio. Everywhere you turn, there's a former dolphin on the air, right? Very. You're fairy. Jim Mandates and Joe Rose rank among the Marcus most popular person now. These Jimmy Siffle says they prestigious dolphins radio play by play gig and boy does he do it early or what? But no wife dolphins profile is risen more this year than WQA and WFWFWFWR personality. Using the word very loosely, Kim Boe camper. 8 years ago, with perfectly content spending his post football, I've selling municipal bonds. As he completes his third month alongside dolphin public address and answer Kenny Walker on WQM's Revant Morning Show, which thank God, got a number and alliance trend in October. Their kick and ass. Boe camper is proved to have friends already knew about him. He has an underrated sense of humor, a drywood apparently, rarely apparent in some Missouri TV and radio work when he was his dullest, a 40 year old razor blade. This is an opportunity to show people our really, other than what they may have perceived me to be, he said. In some ways WQM's Morning Show is still a work in progress, as it tries to find the right balance between sports and non-sports topics and Miguel says when they're not talking about sports, it's a real hysterical funny show. I don't ever hear those segments, though. They're not talking about the fact that they're not talking about sports. But Boe camper has been an asset providing reason commentary and displaying much more of a personality than they did earlier in the square when he was just dull at 75 year old, he's let blue blade. Kim has succeeded in my expectations WGM, a general manager, Siliensjo Belsett. He's better in the combo situation that he's in now than he was by himself. We'll re-opleys with the start there off to, especially that point nine in September. They were real pleased about that. And he's talking about. Do you think? Well, 10 measurement on that. Okay, for 52 is extremely self-analytical. I wish I could tell you how many hours I spend during that day thinking what I'm going to say, what I did say, what I didn't say that I should have said. On TV and radio, I don't see anything casually says Kimba. On WQM, there are these, it's great. I drive away thinking we did a good show. We said the other day is I drive away saying, what am I doing? What was I thinking about that show? It's stuck. People must hate us. And then actually you do a show and you feel good about it. But what does that happen? Volkamper also runs a production company that produces FASN's Micah Siky Sports Rapp was a Dolphins line-backer-indefensive lineman from 7785 and broke it abroad casting in 89 when managed recommended in for a part-time gig on WIOD. I remember those days. He joined Channel 4's at Alphan commentator in 1998 and that was asked to you later to become re-ported back up anchor. Interest rates were at down to about 3% I said maybe it's time to give TV a try. He said leaving the bomb in us. They gave me one of Jim Barry's scripts and said, go read this and I bet you've Bushred it pretty good. Volkamper said that WQM morning show wants to give people something a little lighter than what they've been accustomed to. Rosa's competing show on 79-year-to-ticket, which has a business partnership with a Harold, isn't exclusively sports-oriented either, right, Spirory? But because of Walker's background as an FM morning host combined with WQM's new approach to the show, the program tells it at what attempt news more often than Rosa's does. But here's the kicker, maybe this next sentence man does enough to make me drop a big load right in his chair if I didn't have to clean it up. Oh boy, Barry, you are such a little silly person with your little brown second baloney sandwich. He says at the same time though, WQM wisely has spiced this sports conversation by adding regular segments without spoken Lamar Thomas into real buckly 70-A-M-M Mondays. Through Rosa now, 6-3-A-3-A-M Wednesdays and Kirk Curb Street, 90-M Thursdays. Wysely has spiced up, right, that's tough that balance, you know, between all sports and like 1% entertainment. Rosa, meanwhile, has then renawed 80-M on Monday and Ronnie Brown at 8-2 days. That's downtown Ronnie Brown with a bad hand, who's always good for a third of a year and a cloud of dust. At least a third of a yard. Between 7-10-A-M, Rosa led nearly in the latest ratings book in the key mandumographic 2554, 26-2-3, but QM's new morning thing was in place for only one of the three months that were measured next rating book, I mean we're telling, and last trend, by the way, which breweries oblivious about already they kicked their ass. Iced going boys, Kenny and Boe, who's dull as a 75-year-old, shick razor. Then Barry goes on with more QM information, but we're sure QM intensive today, very nice going, maybe we need all the publicity we can get, even if it's bad. We don't care. WQM's lawsuit against former dolphins running back, Troy Stratford, alleging he moved to 790 without fulfilling a six month non-compete clause, has been settled out of court, according to Stratford's attorney, came Casau. Terms were confidential, but Casau said Stratford will be permitted to continue selling ads and appearing on air for the ticket, WQM declined comment. What are we going to say? What's left to say? Troy, yeah. What we're going to say about him. Good guy like Troy, I mean the fact that he went over there and was trying to stab us in the heart, that's okay, we understand that's business. Everybody's got to make a living. They say in China, Moss the Leaven, everybody's got to make a living. Am I right? That's correct. So we didn't begrudge him anymore, then we begrudge fat boy. In fact, we're glad to be rid of fat boy. Troy, we like having him around. He was kind of like a, well both of them actually are like human punching bags, just one little bit bigger than the other, about five times. 556 votes on the pool, wow, what's your take on the callers? A few of the okay, 238, bring the callers back 169 for Christ's sakes. The show is five without the calls, only 75, 13.4 percent, not good. The callers suck 70 and I hate this pool only four out of almost 600 votes only four, 0.7 percent. I'm never they can really associate with them, really two across the street, 0.7. In fact, in that two to four slot for a while, they were starting to get pretty damn close. The biggest thing, nice building. The challenge for this is real life. One people was probably not ready to write next issue, A.M. Why, they're you best. A ride. Look at through the bars at the county jail. O.J. was there, he began to whale. She got in the ditch, was there because he drank too much. The time was looking for some food, touch of those dots. Look at all the jailhouse dots. Everybody was rather there, socks. Getting ready for the jailhouse dots. This, to fit, packed was a look at so well. Saying that as much was a living hell. Cops in the corner with his burrito. He said to talk about his way to go to the cops. Look at all the jailhouse dots. Everybody was grabbing their socks. File on at the jailhouse dots. And you with the jailhouse dots. Watch them fuck up, rock. Oh, rock. Look at them stiff and they're junk. Everyone checkin' their lawn. Everybody has had hardnought. And two to go jailhouse dots. I want to be a Latino. If they're a 21, I want to be a Latino. And say hey, my no and we're there on my head now. I want to wear a slick 50 in my hair. And dark circles, this is the cover of my face. I want to drive in a big car with left foot skin. In gear, rear with loud ass. I want to go name one, need a. I want to go name one, need a with both black hair. Take blue, I and big old chains. I love the no. I love the no. I love the no. I want to knew a Latino. I want to know a Latino. Next up, he wore a blue bed and a dark two. He's eyes, he had baggy, homie pants that said, wait down, he had a white muffle shirt that was way too tight. I love the no. I love the no. I love the no. I love the no. And when I grow up, I want to be just like him's killer with a 30 dollar T4 T. I wouldn't need to buy a fancy bathroom or a computer. A micro-photent A-c-d-d-d-d-d. Even a Schlepper, like so good Brian, has better equipment, but even so. Oh, when I grow up, I want to be just like a chicken styleer than I would have just been like, oh, there comes my soul, but I wouldn't have to stay my dear. I think that sounds just fine. The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression. Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait. Just the way it's going to be. We like to be Saddam Hussein, and it's here with our minds. Since I get watched, it's had a slow, like a male-a-way to ride. We try to steal away Kuwait, and be the oil sheep, our lush blue night, up to its place, and the way it is. We want to be a fight to Kuwait, and be the oil sheep, our lush blue night, we're gonna fight for the war. We're gonna fight for the war. We're gonna fight for the war. We're gonna fight for the war. We're gonna fight for the war. We're gonna fight for the war. We'll be cursed, not me. So, Shini, If I part in heaven, up, we'll die, Shini. If I part in heaven, we'll do what she says. Send me straight to hell, or can anybody smell. Up in heaven. Yeah. Does guess act the same? Does it linger in heaven? Would you be ashamed? To throw my finger ever? That's a good idea. I know these things. When the fat lady says, "'Cause I'll be the warm woman. You'll fare it here to heaven. "'Cause I know I'll be warm and warm. Just to heaven." Do you ever think when you're your Chinese? It ain't pocket chicken bottle fat signies. Yet a food tastes great, so you don't complain. But that's not chicken in your chicken town, means it seems to me I ordered sweet and sour pork. But God filled some of my fork. It's for him here on my fork. There's a cat in the kettle at the beaching room. The place that I eat every day at noon. They can feed your cat and you'll never know. Once they're out there, I'll thin no voice. They fire real crisp in the hole. Chaolin asked him, I ordered more as he was dialing up his body at the home. That's the same night today. I lost my appetite. There's two cats in my belly and they warm the fight. I was sucking on a roll in and the tongues of two. When I swear, I heard it mute. And that is when I knew. There's a cat in the kettle at the beaching room. Think I got a stuffed eaten there with no. They say that it's beef or fish or pork. But it's heard and there on my fork. There's a hairball on my fork. Hello, this is Albert Kider from Tauly Band Records. I'm fighting you American Infidel. Can I lay this cat's Stevens collection? You know my home, it is right. Take your hair off your body. Got a machete with the real sharp blade. I wish I had an American hostage. Make those in their heads. I was only shooting this plastic. I was on the airplane. And suddenly the DJs, their matches I can burn. And wear a towel on my head. I know that I'm in followed by an X16. But to the one with... The money from your purchase does not go to fund terrorism. Really? It's not time to get off the plane. Just relax and take it easy. You're just dumb. That's your fault. It wouldn't have been a fire with you. Find dark skin and a rag. If you won't, a detainee. Another variation on the classic. What a surprise! Ask myself every day. Which Americans should pay? Tell me who a new home is saying. I'm telling you that nobody can't do the makeup on me. How bright. She lives a very unexposed house. So buy new catch, see with collections today for 1995. Or you can pay with visa, message card, or weapons of mass destruction. I'll tell you what's really impressive. We have 789 friends at our MySpace page. How do you like that? Like that, huh? For an old guy like you? For an old guy like me? That's pretty impressive. For a fat old, out-of-touch guy like me? That's pretty amazing. Because it's only young living in breathing pumps pretty much that have my space page. Yep, but nevertheless. I'll over keep Tiki Shazan here. He's 168. 576 votes on the poll. And most importantly, 19. That's a big number. 19 minutes away from that big 11 o'clock. Press conference at which Larry Cocates is going to get canned. And probably Paul D's too. You know, when you think? No. No? Well, why not? Because this swim team is doing pretty good. The biggest name, so best. Tell me about that. That's a bad name. Let me find it. For a radio 560.

As opposed to eat the burrito which is loaded with carbs and probably going to give me an oil clog. What's your take on a call or a 799 vote? You wait till Monday man, something may or may not happen. Would I regard an old depends on what I feel. A few would be okay 32 not too many. A few if you call. It's like maybe four or five a year and hour. Bring the calls back to 13 30% of this audience. So I'm not turning. And Britain was bastards back. The show is fine without the calls only 88, 12.5% the call is suck 82 and I hate this pull out of over 700 votes still. So I meant to quad draw. How do you like that only for 0.5% a number of people can relate to? The biggest point time. The best challenge for the business is $1. Sports Radio 560. You A M.

I was really emotional segment for me, I'll tell you. Okay. CNN is all over this Harold thing, like Stink on Greg. Access with a pat. So the deal here is, is that basically if you're an employee, you deal with it, you know, what the hell's going on? There's nothing new. If you've been sleeping or like black Friday, you know, whatever you've been doing. A former employee of the Illinois Bowl Harold, the Harold Spanish language they lose papers inside one Harold Plaza building in downtown Miami with a machine gun, I sure hope it's not a good machine. The former employee identified as Jose Verella former cartoonist, it said to be on the sixth floor where the newspapers produced as of noon the entire floor was evacuated. Verella was reported to be inside on Verto Castelo Castelo's office, Castelo is executive editor of the Spanish newspaper, Harold, Verella was reportedly fired last February. Maybe he's got a fire. Let's hope not. He's got a machine gun, man. Police have surrounded the building and CNN's all over this, like I said, I think on Clarence. That's February. How about your pardon? That's February. He got canned. It says was we've portedly fired last February. While he's a slow burn. Yes, seriously. Or maybe he's just there to make a statement, you know, who the hell knows what's going on?

I think we can do it. We got a real shot. Oh, that's a bad shot. What's your take on a callers? A few would be OK to 150. Bring the calls back with the next automation point 231. You maniac, you look at that. I tell you it's so much easier for me, you know. Not as easy as today, but it's pretty easy. The show is fine without the calls, only 95, a mere 12.2%. The callers suck 92, that's another 12% and I hate this pool. What do you think that is? What you're probably looking at it? No. Still the same four. Out of 774 votes, still the same four is 0.5%. Is that impressive or what? I mean, we all see it in. Who are out in your previous, we said we've got to move it up. They're all set up. All the cameras are outside.
