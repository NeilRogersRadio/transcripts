That bitch you played yesterday. We won. This is not Peter King. This is Steven King. You don't scare me. Oh god. That was funny. There's going to be a moral service for Chuck Zink. When Monday, let's see. Next Monday, Monday to 16th. The guards Memorial Park on your motto and military trail in Bokeh. I don't have the time though. Thanks to Joyce Kaufman for passing that long, but I don't know what time it is. That's Monday. Okay, because I've talked to Arthur Hurts from Romaco last week about maybe having one day. Oh my god. Well, that's the, he was the, I know, but the boy. An answer got in the memories, huh? And, you know, I know she and Chuck were all friends. I said, we should do something in Dave County. And so I think they're working on the, on the Wilson Museum as a possibility, where they will at our Kyvel stuff. Mm-hmm. So there might be something here too. I'll be damned. No. So anyway. Yes, things are looking up, baby, for the new year. As a Cub Span, we've been released from the Greg Reed-Ragee man from the fear and loading in Miami. We got a new regime and everything is really looking good. Before you get to that, yes. I'm hopeful, as I'm sure you are that Andre Dawson gets good news from Hall of Fame today. Oh yeah. To Saf the noon is when they will release the votes. And you were a Cub fan for a long time when Andre Dawson. I am on the Wilson of the Chicago Cubs. And this is the Neil Rogers one to two hour gocubs. Oh, you're all right. I like that. I like that a lot. Yeah. Yeah, the Hawke was one of my favorites. He was great. He should get in. Absolutely. You couldn't mean more for the years in Montreal, but also with the Cubs. He had a lot of big years. He was great. Yep. Great arm. Good run. Good guy. So that like company has didn't like him too well. What was that thing he had with his neighbor about his satellite. Does remember that big flaky hand? I don't remember that. Flack. Flack jacket. Yeah, there was some little. There's always something in the as neighbor starting a bunch of cramp. Not where I live. Good luck Hawk. No, well, you're probably staying anonymous. You stand with the radar except for the little dog that people down the hall have. Yeah, me. And you start see if thing and you're happy. Yep, and the happen well there's a way to solve that. Yeah, although there's this new dog food that was on. Do you see that story? That's really sad. I had more of a dry, you know, the duck flutty drop kick. You're bad. I could just see that little dog. You know, as he sales through the uprights. Yeah, go ahead and buy him some. What's this diamond pet food? You see that pets are dying like crazy from this. But anyway, it's sad being the dog level that I'm not. I'm not going to take no joy and see in dogs. I work at that not the owners would have died. We've been all right. Yeah. Maybe that's what you should do. Probably not the little dogs fall. Just go after the owner. You can't go off of the camera fuse. So speaking of that, evidently the Marlins can't make anybody know for the camera fuse. Because no matter where they go, they get the same response. Oh, well, we're sure glad to meet you. But no way. Yeah. I can't even give any public money. First of all, San Antonio, now was Portland, Oregon. By the way, Portland, the mayor has been saying that right along. Right. Because I don't want to see Portland taking out any mortgage in our children's future. I haven't seen any plan that allows for baseball to work here. And the meantime, I mean, talk about a threat to leave. The Marlins say they'll play a dolphin stadium at least two, but no more than five more. Well, Lisa, up to five now. Yeah. No more than five more. You know, you must have stayed in 20 years where I had it here. Yeah. That is, and Sanchez is we're exploring all possibilities. I never thought it would come to this. Boy, pretty sad. I would say. Hmm. Especially with a guy left for a ball club, pretty sad too. Well, that's the other thing. It's, uh, what have they got to sell? Not much. I say everybody jump on that Panthers van Ragan, baby. Better couple of girls teams come up later this week. We've got the blues in the Columbus Street jackets. I'm assuming those games are on the road. It's kind of... Remorial, isn't it? That's correct. Remorable being town? Well, I don't know. It's just as the passage, I'm assuming it's a road game because it's, uh, it doesn't really say here. I don't, I don't know whether it's... They're home. They're home against them. They are home? Yep. The Remorable being town to rip out the knees spot, Pananas. That's my challenge to remember. Say, say right to his face, what you told me behind is back all those years. Remember, boychop a little bit. But they've done frog. Well, by the way, speaking to the dumb people, I know you don't care about this, but two weeks from yesterday is the big Canadian National Election. Yeah. I read it on the... The same mistake here that Americans have made all of a sudden they get disenchanted with the liberals. And the conservatives in this morning's poor are way, way ahead they're going to have a majority government looks like. Stephen Harper who in the past was always considered to be a clone of Bush with his own Canadian Bush and Nio cons. And they're going to make the same mistake. So if you love Bush, you're going to really love Stephen Harper. What a bad mistake they're going to make here. But, tell me. Look to Rude the day. You won't move, though. No, I'm not going to affect me. I'm going to make an impact in my life. I was reading where Las Vegas is going through overbuilding. Finally. Yeah, you know what I mean? Well, they're building all these condos out there and kind of hotels. And some of them are starting to be canceled because... Well, there's a glutton. You get to a saturation pool and I don't know what that point was, but I guess they finally reached it. Yep. I mean, how much money is there out there? A bunch of your duffs. Well, this is residential stuff. I've actually really not too happy about the situation in South Florida with a slice passing. I mean, because anything that, you know, whether it was Atlantic City or now this... Would it just sit out? Would it just sit out? Would it sit in a way, trip in a way? All those out there missing any meals out there. You think that that would stop anybody from going out there. The fact that there is going to be slot machines at the tracks. Sure. I don't think so. Well, a good personal example. I mean, if I were there, if I was in South Florida most of the time, and I hadn't discovered woodline here, and it didn't spend most of my time here, I wouldn't go to Vegas. I could go plant my guts there. See, the thing with Vegas is, after you've seen all the new glitzy casinos, and, you know, that's it. Once you've seen them all, what else is there to see? Because inside, when you strip away all the trappings and the paintings, like in Velagio and the fountains and the water pushing and all that stuff, when you take that all away, it's a bunch of tables and a slot machines. You know, it's all could be anywhere. It's still a destination. It's different because of shows and... Yeah. Yeah, the entertainment out there, and it's a long-shelap man, a long-shelap for a lot of people and expensive. The amount of money you still want to go away. Yeah. Well, the certain amount of times, but I, well, we'll see. We'll find out. I think there are people that go there maybe two, three times a year, that you know what? Go there once. They said the same thing about Atlantic City. Oh, it's going to have a lot of space. Yeah, but Atlantic City is a dump as a toilet. And God. Howlendale? Pomp and O? Pomp and O is not a toilet. Howlendale? Oh boy, you sure got a bug up your ass about Colstney, man. I wasn't even thinking about that. I think real careful. I would be surprised if our old... Your good buddy there shows up in a... It's a hell of an hell of a nail now, set a highly... ...a... ...a roll-mar teen as your buddy. Well, you won't see me there. I'll be a call, though. Yeah. It's great over there. I agree with that. I have no problem with Colbert. Had many of enjoyable afternoon there, plunging my guts out. But... Anyway. Alright, back into my console as Josevolo's junior days. Yeah, when they opened up Mississippi, the same... ...it doesn't matter where they opened up. All you never found out who Gary Cohen was, by the way. How come I keep letting you off the hook? Gary Cohen? The Jackie and then Jackie Agent, Gary Cohen. Oh, don't you remember I asked you if... Yeah, you did. Was related to Gary Cohen, you said, how about my... ...com. Yeah, who is that? I'm going to force to ask, Eddie, Kim, I'm Gary Cohen. I can't believe that. Being the racing maven that you are, he wasn't a bad Jackie. He was... and then he became a John Sage. And I think he got injured, and became an agent. You're supposed to be the expert on that crap. Next to be asking me who Gary being is. I know Gary being. He's still... he's still at the top of the stretch by the way. He's somebody I put an extra... How about Derek Ascivito? I remember him? He went to bed. He was alright. He was okay. He was the guy that died that they had the memorial. What the hell was that Jackie? Donald... Donald Rumsfeld? Donald... Oh, I know you're talking about. Fromfield? No. Yes. Fromfield? Fromfield? This guy just said... Yeah. I thought you said Rumsfeld. Well, I said that first just to be a wise man. Fromsfeld, that was wishful thinking. Yeah, Donald Rumsfield. Well, that was a long time ago. I know. Well, that's what happens when he gets to be injured. But he want to Kentucky Derby. Next we're going to be talking about loads of dustman and cherry pop and pop savage. See, there's something to be said for gay to be an old code. And not too much to be said for it. But one of the things is, look at all the people that we outlived, you know? Yeah. And I'm not saying it was that we're bad people. Like pop savage was always nice to me. He was a good guy. It was. He's been dead a long time now. Just so son Joey last weekend. Yeah, good guy. Joey works a call. I thought he also worked a gulstream. He's not a gulstream right now. No, but I... You used to see him a gulstream to work there. Yeah. But now he's a caller and he's not a gulstream for this meat. So, yeah. That couldn't be fixed. Don't forget that I'm hearing callin those races. Yes, it is. Oh, my God. Tell you what the horses are thinking. No wonder I was sick to my stomach yesterday. Well, he just... Yep. Not that he's dead bad, you know? He's not great. But he's not that bad. But he's just... Personally, he's just offensive to me. And he just bothers me. He's an idiot. Oh, he's certainly better at what he does than Mike Pataglia. Mike Pataglia is a nice guy. You keep telling me that. There are a lot of nice guys out here, but you're not going to have him call a races. I think all you've had about Vic. He is just awful. Yeah, but Pataglia is not the best. He is... he's one of the very worst. One of the... all-time worst. But, you know, you turn on Santa Neaton, listen to Trevor Caller. I enjoy him a lot, yeah. I like that. Now, he sure doesn't make any mistakes. I'll tell you that. But we're getting a little bit too close to the horse racing thing. So we've been here like a chop this off. Okay. Two days probably had a big racing day. I wouldn't think. Uh, no. Most of the tracks are dark today. Well, tell you, I'll tell you who's open. Just one moment please, all you anti-gambling people. Oh, look at that. We got racing from South Africa in a half an hour. Oh. To Philadelphia, Tampa Bay, to Paradise, Coorthed Downs, Hardness, Dobra Downs, Northfield Park, Georgia, to much harness racing for you today. Yeah, I'm not involved today. Yeah, you got Philadelphia, which is really crappy racing in Tampa Bay. Well, I'm surprised they still got a track. Still running over there in Tampa, aren't you? Yeah, doing very well. Are they really based on what? On the slots? They don't have slots. They don't have slots. They know that. They have a tendency to have full fields. Well, why are they doing very well? Is that because of the ice-browshing job over there? It's well-managed. I'll be damned. Yep. People go there from all calories. They have a pretty wide base of people from different, you know, Sarasota, say, Breatington, Yvonneus? Well, block that place. Yeah. No, they are doing well. Temple terrorists, loose, loose. Yeah, I remember Lombay. Do you ever drive through Pompey? Very quickly. Or is no, I'm not thinking to Pompey. I'm thinking to two egg. Two egg is a stoplight. Nine nursing that one. Never seen the stoplight, it sits the town. Two egg. What are you going to start traveling through bar stuff? Well, I've been to there. And Brandon. Yep. For Josh's from Brandon. These are from there. You're not from the right. No. From Brandon? Brandon, we're all the fast food joints. Yeah. It's like East to Tampa when you're going on 60-year-old. Brandon is. Brandon. They got fast food joints and been invented yet. Well, let's leave them on a carry this on too much because somebody will go to the area, test the again and all of a sudden, then other shape. We haven't even mentioned it today. Yeah, you did. Right on the box, you mentioned after the promo, you had some cost to cut. Oh, I just said I enjoyed the game. I mean, spirit and hateful comment. What are you guys going wrong? You know, what's that all about? I'm going to explore that tomorrow. I'll be listening. Yeah. Okay. Have a great day. Get that South Africa racing for now. Yeah. What about some of the do? This is Gorten, Lydia. And they don't come any worse than Neil Roger. Welcome. Sweet, so low we hear. We're going in your mouth. A second we'll stop doing something we have. The Chateau didn't get in the by itself. We should have that's your audition. The rich are here. And we're going to meet.

I said, I saw an amazing movie last night. Really very good with Richard gear. And I watched it. So you have to think a lot of times when most of us make a mistake. If somebody we can't stand is in a movie, we just refuse to watch it. And sometimes we miss a really good movie. Or sometimes we have a lawyer. I'm talking about Pramil Fear with Richard gear. And it's Norton. And Francis McDormand, who I'm just crazy about. She's fabulous. She's one of my very favorite rides. Anyway, it's already 1014. We don't have time to delete that.

Gee, it's all the gas-flate things in canoons. You're insolventing, and it's all more than two. And it's all the energy and all the sorrows you've done to them. This is for the set-fit for them. And it's the in-breath by the men. And that's the fact that they both leave this youth. Guns, suns and men's your team, you need my shoes. You use your guns at it to fill some kids for the NRA. Guns were made for smart-slide youth. Gee, it's all the current things you can do. You use other edge and haven't been breath-cooms. And it's all the energy that's held sideways as you say. And it's easy to get moral, all the best that you adore. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. So this is the only thing you can do. And it's all the time. And it's all the time. So anyway, Primal Fear 1996, Richard Gear, Laura Lini, Edward Norton, who's just incredible in this movie, Francis McDormand, and our good friend, my close personal buddy, Stephen Vauer, and we're talking about the idea. Who is cast? That's one of the unfortunate things. In fact, one of the reviews I read about the movie after I watched it. So it's too bad that they wasted the talents of some of the character actors like Stephen Vauer. And real stereotypical, you know, weak back. Weak back against the type. But anyway, he, you know, come out alive. And it's as I could, I could ruin the movie for you. Oh, no, but I already did. So that's all right. No, I didn't. No, Miguel did. He saw it, said it was great. And then I ruined the ending for it. What an idiot. You know, he sent me an email last night out of nowhere about 820, just out of the blue, okay? Saying, uh, when my brains have turned to, I've just found that my brains have turned to Schmitt or something like that. I just, just, I don't know where. What does that mean? Or he felt bad about leaving you in the lurch there with that promotion yesterday. Because he knows better. Yeah, I mean, it was better than, give me a song and answer about how I can listen to Howard Stern, which even if I were to wanted to, that wouldn't have worked anyway. But it's lost it, man. Apparently. I just lost it. I think it's time he needs to go bond with Aliana and Fidel for a while. Maybe a couple of meals would be good. Find a way to the charity cases of QMR. We need panicking now because come to find out that we don't have room at the infer charity cases anymore. Anyway, this is a really good movie. And, uh, like I said, Richard, you were nearly. I see him and I said automatically goes to another channel. But I just happened to, took it on. At the time it came out of 10 30 last night. Yeah. And it had three stars on the, uh, on the crawl on the bottom. Three stars. And he said, well, maybe it's going to be pretty good. And after the first 10 minutes, you don't realize it's Richard gear anymore. That's how good he was. Wow. He was very good. Really? Well, he can't act. He just bugged it. You know, he's, but he didn't, he doesn't bug you after a while because he, just, I don't know. It may be because you become so engrossed in the story. Plus, the fact is about a Chicago art special who's a pervert and, uh, gets murdered. And that's in the beginning. Although we don't find out he's a pervert later on, but kind of assume that right off the bat. Anyway, the, uh, Marla, I guess we ought to do the pull result, right? A little bit back up today. We had a long cross over with the Humphord to entertain the people. There's a lot of people over there who just, uh, slap and no wings. There is the elite of confirmation hearing going on this patley. He just should check some such things. I'm going to be put a loop, put it up. We could carry that, you know, and just kind of sit back and, What's the audience vanished? 163 votes. What's your number one answer to this? Most people are stupid. 490. Right. So that's what I was. Uh, I guess I should have clear off of it. Just most people in general. I don't want to see in South Florida. I've always picked it on South Florida, which is easy to do. These are the people we know. Just people in general. Generals. Yeah. 10490. These in 308. Now that was nice that that moved up there. And it was second place, especially in South Florida. Most people are decent 308. Yeah, give them a break. Cut them some slack. Give them a little slack and then cut them some slack. Uh, A holes 252. That was my vote. Hippocrates 2.26. One dimensional 108. Reasonable 71. Rude 53. Rude. In fact, maybe that could be our new Rude 56. That could be our new logo for the new year. Rude 56. What do you want? A lifeless 31. Biggest 19. Jurfs 17. Perverts 15. And ugly only 12. Oh, goodness. What? I don't know about that. There are a lot of good people out there believe you may. I see what in the mirror every morning. Continuing to explore possible relocation three Marlin executives visited Portland, Oregon, yesterday and found the same sign of the answer in counter everywhere in South Florida any place they go. A lack of appetite to cover more than just a portion of stating financing cost through public funding. Hey. Although Marlin's prison David Sensen said funding plans weren't discussed, Portland may or Tom Potter said he survived previous comment that public finance baseball would not be coming to Portland on his watch and that was not a point of discussion today he said. Then sound too fruitful to me. Does it look? David Sensen sounds a little fruity but this didn't sound too fruitful. Asked if Facebook had worked in Portland Potter said it late after in the news conference, I don't know. I haven't seen a plan yet that does it. I don't want the city of Portland taking out any mortgage in our children's future. What a breath of fresh air. What a refreshing attitude. Sensen also said conversations continue about building a retractable roof stadium on Wayne High's single owned land next to Dolphin Stadium. But the funding gap between $75 and $500 million remains. How come on you guys out there? Confident. What a small. What are what are the patents that is $75 and $100 million right? Right. I got that ready. In fact, there's like maybe five million people in South Florida, Dave Roud and Palm Beach. So 100 million. That's like 20 bucks a piece. Really? Yeah, 20 bucks a piece. Even you'd cough up 20 bucks. I'd cough up 20 bucks. I'd cough up. I'd cough up. I'm sure Joshua, but you wouldn't, but Joshua put in 40 because it keeps out of the job goal. He could put in my share. Right. The idea of placing a dome on Dolphin Stadium's also been raised recently, but Sensen said that the marlins are not considering that. That's good because they ain't going to work. The marlins say they'll play a Dolphin Stadium at least two, but not more than five more seasons were leaving in five years if you don't get with it. Sensen were storing all possibilities I never thought it would come to this. Well, a suckers board every minute, David, that's where it goes. Okay. All these rich guys running around looking for a hand out. Why don't you want to do this for us? Nah. Too bad. Let's see. We got the, where are you talking about the bombings in Iraq yesterday? But the bad news is that 20 Americans have been killed since Thursday, particularly dead leads for a period for Americans. The numbers are just mushrooming up there with latest military deaths at least 20. We crossed that magical 2200 number. Did that do it? No. Is the public up at arms and filed the Democrats finally saying when and out let us get out? No. I don't think there is any number. Is there? No. There is. Why? The, at least 227 US service members have died since the war started in 2003. 2002, 2007. And it just goes on and on and nobody seems to really give a crap. That's the sad part. I said those people, you know, innermately involved, loved ones, the friends, the families, they did, but they beat the group of the net. Nobody cares. Because the governments do a fabulous job of keeping it, you know, arms length. We don't see those flag-grade coffins. We don't hear too much about it. And now we got the a little hearing so we clung. And they said, and then it goes on and on. And so anything else, you know, for it there was the coldmiders. Now it's the little hearing. This will, this will too up at other week. So we don't even hear anymore about all the indictments, you know? That's really sad. You know, those Republican indictments. All right. And let me say it again. If you didn't take a look at our website right under the poll, you'll see that I did watch, say, yes, they have to show that was a real hoot. Wolf looks great. He has no other scream or feels banana man. Very good. How are Dean tells him that there is on the single Democrat related to the Jack A. Bramaz scandal or took any money from him? And, but I don't want to say to it. Wolf is so deflated over the fact that he couldn't. He couldn't squeeze at least one name out of our, it is very depressed. You've got to watch that. Just watch the clip. It's a couple of minutes. Well, invest it to your time. Keep your office street. You'll get it here. You will. And your eye and maybe in your fly. 27 past 10 at 5. 60, 72, M.A. let's take a look at this line up. We got the mole mice to read two mad dog, three son-law hours for the seven. No panther game again until Thursday. What kind of a schedule is this? Guilty is seven o'clock tonight. Makes a rare occurrence with his own show. Eddie K.10. How do you like that? The guilty mice is on. Do you like it? I like it.

Philipsy Moore Hoffman, one of the critic's choice award is best actor. I need to see that. Just seen that on the crawl. You got to go see Capote and sound so. Yeah, nevertheless. If you're not going to go see Bearback Mountain why would you go see Capote? Well, because here he was actually somebody. And at least with his boom when the actress for I walked the line. Did you know? Yes, he did. At least with his boom. I had to go see that too. Well, I'll wait for it to come on cable. What about that movie? I was just talking about Primal Fear with Richard Gear. I think I can say it on the watch and not on the other one. No, he didn't familiar. No, he actually he really had any for another movie. He came in to say. Oh. No, I don't think so. I think he probably told you what happened. Because this is a movie if you spill the beans on the ending. I mean, if there's no point in watching it. 560560. 560. Tom 560. We didn't pick up right where we left off yesterday. We had fantastic. What? That's never. I would say I was one of my favorite days of all time yesterday. We had so many. Maybe even the Yorvan guy will call back or maybe he died. Maybe died in the sleep overnight. 560560. 560. 560. Verizon. Sigat Arroyal. Again, Monday next Monday to 16. The moral service for a skipper Chuck Zink at the Gardens of a Moral Park on your Model and Military Trail in Voka.

I'm waiting for that 18-minute blade of build up so that we start to respond. Just bring it right off the hook. What? What? What? There they go? Yeah, there it goes. There it goes. You know what that's going to be? I mean, is there any doubt about that one? What? What is with this week? I thought not to wrap to the holidays and I thought maybe it was like the back to like life again, but it just is not. You think that was like there right right today was like Christmas day? Come in to QAM, hello. QAM. QAM. QAM. QAM. QAM. QAM. Okay, that was our call for today. Wow, just put a sign on the door. Oh, out of business. Gone fishing. This is really special yesterday and if you thought yesterday was good, just wait till the day. Well, we're not building any pool, the only one you want us to say. I don't know something would be good. Anything you want. Starting with all that heavy duty political stuff and see how long I leave you on. Well, I was also depressing yesterday. That to me was worse than the rest of it. When I all start about fat ass, bush stuff that we already knew about and talked about last week, you know? Just, you know, you see, it would be one thing if talking about it would change something, but the fact that it matter is, it will not like these areas. We're all exactly like that's going to change something. And there's just like yesterday with all those opening statements in the wrong time, to get rid of Pony. Well, well, well, well, what's the purpose of that? Only it is wasted day and that's all. Just one more day that the media is next to talk about what's really going on in the world. Somebody QAM, hello. Neil. You're talking about it. Is that a movie with rich, here's a lawyer? Yes. And there's something about that. Edward Norton being crazy or something or multiple personnel? Right. Exactly. That's the one. That's the great movie. It was. Yeah. You're right about the ending. Many people come to your house and beat the cramp body. Yeah. Good movie though. That's great day. All right. You were. See, there's somebody in soft primal fear. See, one thing about, I call me crazy, okay? You're crazy. Oh, I know. But, uh, somebody times we talk about these different movies and like almost, almost nobody has ever seen any of them. That is correct. Well, what's that all about? I guess these people look at them. How much is that in? Or, or their lousy excuses for shut-ins because they don't have cable. I see. Now, what's your excuse? How come you didn't see a problem? I think I did see a signal. I did see a signal. Well, if you've seen it, it's all the same. I think I see now. This is a little slow, much of the idea you forget. It's a little bit too profound, a little bit to the ending. And since you're such a stickler on good endings, man. Right. This one would have like topped right the, Oh, my, my. Maybe I avoided it because of the Richard Richard years. And it's highly common. A crisis, McDurhamman was in it. She canceled it out. Who more than that exactly? She's great. How many of you are in? Hello. Hey, good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? That was, that was the first movie I ever saw had Northern End and I liked him ever since. I think he said, George told you to watch the movie American History X. Yeah. And if you watched it, you'd never know what the same guy. I know you would be named. You would not know what the, I didn't know he's in. Exactly. And, and, you know, I wanted to thank you for one of your sponsors, lawyers, office, hop and running and again, Eddie. They did that little, they did a little work for me. During the last year in the professional, say, little money and I really appreciate it. Excellent. I don't know why you're in this film. I don't know what the matter with your sales department's in there. They need to boot them all out and bring some people in. If this is a chance, I'll show that they're not with the crap. Amen. Thanks a lot, pal. I'd like to. Well, I think we got some changes coming. We got a great new general manager, which everybody's just raving about your bell. And there's some, like I said, somebody to cheer to Kate. I mean, some of the people who have been hanging around. I mean, I guess that I think it was right the first time charity cases. See, you know, it's one thing to, it's like pain, you know, you get used to it. And then when the pain finally goes away, then you think, oh my gosh, what a relief this is. I didn't, we've never realized how annoying that was all that time. And that was the great weed era, you know, the era of paranoia and fear and loathing and, see, it's one thing to say, well, I'm a hands off guy. Well, that's one thing. It's another thing to say, I'm just oblivious. And I'm in my own world, I got my own agenda and whatever, you know, we've got a pleasant time, believe you me. And even, of course, he is remaining as our consultant. Oh, what a joke that is. Somebody QAM, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Chugs and tight. Yeah. Oh, Jesus Christ. Yeah, he's Christ. Him too. Somebody QAM, hello. Neil, how are you? Yes. All right. And how many years did it take for the Soviet, out of Afghanistan? About 30 minutes. So that's how many of you see we're going to be in Iraq? Hey, like, don't, don't, don't spoil any of your energy worrying about that. Okay. I mean, this is a bunch of innocent people dying over there. Don't get all whipped up about that. Just nobody else seems to care. The politicians don't care. And the animals don't care. Nobody cares. Including a lot of these parents who think that's really wonderful to send their kids over to the human sacrifice for your father, for your father. Because that's all they are. Dying for no good reason at all, when a clagmire, they're desperately trying to figure out some way to get out of there. And Donnie, Hermann Gering, Rumsfeld, told us just a couple of weeks ago, we're going to withdraw 7500 troops this year, maybe 7500 out of 138,000. That's not exactly what you call a whole month, hardly. Right. And of course, that was before all this new violence and mayhem and bloodshed started up again. Which every day now, you've got double digit dead people. Can you imagine? I mean, you know, we had the 3,000 and 9, 11, but that was basically it. But can you imagine if every single day in America, we had double digit people dying from terrorist attacks or from bombings, that they had that bomb scare, which I'll get to eventually. It's in San Francisco yesterday. It's Starbucks. Did you see that story? No. No, really. Well, you better hear with it, Mr. You better start checking out your Starbucks. But that was just a hoax. And they, but to be put up in everybody's all up in arms, it was a major story. If we had like double digit people dying every day, there would be people would be like riding in the streets like, how come you're not stopping this? What's going on over here? And then of course, I guess the bush response to that would be, well, better to keep it over there than over here, you know? Better than the rush. Of course, us, I think would include those 227 dead Americans, but nevertheless, they'll start again with that anti-American propaganda. You can eat in bastard you. What a son of China, it's beautiful, baby. We got like Indian fall communists, we got to know what's going on. It could be that global warming could it? It could be like in the 30s and then like in the 40s and next three days, a big apartment, there's a such thing, remember that's a liberal plan. And buffalo in the 50s, the next couple of days, how do you like that? Well, if you ever wanted to go to Buffalo, I don't do it. 1041 is 560 QAM, and you're shopping for shoes.

Can you sit and rain your jeans? Watchin' that giant monkey. The music way for the tea to be tea. Remember, raise your knees. Thank you, John Paul, I'm sleeping. Why did that you really get in? You're the special effects of these. But take out a whistle to the floor. Thank you. I'm in an extra mission to be. Three walking in the morning tall. 47 judges ago see it in the judges' eyes. Second edamist. Sure. I would rather watch Primal Shared though before I'd watch that. Okay. McGill is really really ending for us. A little different. No, he was talking about a different movie. He had it wrong. I see. He's seen it again since I forgot. I was out thinking maybe I should begin. You're copying that. It's what we're seeing. That's what was granted to me. I did the AC subs people have your movie during their drush. Yeah, I'm going to be getting mad. No one is tonight. Tonight. And I'll watch it tonight. Maybe. But I'm going to say. I'm going to be a little flying crap about the DVD. You just want to food. And Larry said he stopped his brain of food today. Yes, that's the thing. Why isn't it just amazing? Everybody seems to be in so much better of a mood now. And everything that the sun is even shining here is a result. You can take them from under this dark cloud at QAN. We didn't even realize I guess you could like I said he used to. We're like pain. And now the dark cloud has been listed. And we can see some daylight at the end of the channel. And then made a skate from a<|ko|>Hagasi also a scene some daylight. And then made a skate from the Nate County stockade this morning. If a silly next to the Turner geoford night detention center, that renal the Rapala was skate from a December. The Department of Correction said he escaped in May to his 25 year old black man about 5 foot 9 and 160 pounds. He was lasting in the area of southeast eighth court and parked drive and mommy's springs. Correction officers said he made somehow got out of the holding area behind the main jail building this morning. It's unknown how the man escaped from the air, which is surrounded by a barbed wire. How do you like that? Maybe he had gloves on. Officials haven't said what the man is charged with. The stockade is an older facility next to TGK. We're accused of a rapala skip on December 20. We'll go out there with ketchup. We just can't hold on to my guess. Upon his return from an extended vacation yesterday, the W.O.R. New York host made it official. Bob Grant plans to retire on Friday after 58 years behind the mic. How do you like that? Bob Grant. Bob Grant all races to the Stacker crab. Heathful hate-mongering right wing piece of turd Bob Grant. Following the announcement on his afternoon show Grant took calls from listeners, local celebrities and politicians offering good wishes to the radio veteran, to the radio Nazi, and reminisced on his incredible broadcast career, which also includes a student after noon's at W.A.B.C. in New York. In the almost 60 years he's been on the air, Bob is gained the allegiance and affection of millions of listeners. W.O.R. Vice President General Mangler Bob Bruno said, Bob is not only a great broadcaster, but he's a great American and a great friend and a great racist. The legendary Bob Grant will always enjoy the utmost respect and sincere gratitude of W.O.R. and Buckley Broadcasting for a job well done. He likes it well done. I like it kind of medium well myself. So, by Bob Grant and don't let the door hit you nasty and away out. I put him in the same category as Greg Reel leaving. I'll at least do about Grant doesn't affect us. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I guess maybe we'll change the pool to 11 o'clock to the one that Eric Scott tomorrow's right? Okay. I actually have a really really good one for Thursday. Not that the one isn't good for tomorrow, but I really know I mean by really good. I know you mean. In fact, I'm just changing it over right now. Really? Well, not to the really good one. Here's the last check of this one. 1667 votes. What's your number one answer to? Most people are stupid 5008. These in 320 it. That's awfully nice. A-holes 259. Pippercrets 233. One dimensional one 14. Reasonable 72. Route 56. Route 56. How do you like the way that turned out? It's amazing. That's our station. If you have a big billboard campaign. Route 56. We'll give you some jingles, some pantingos. Bye bye. Our lifeless 31. Biggest 19. 17. Jurks 17. Pervert 16. Ugly only 12. Ah. Okay, let me just change it right now. I'm sure we can put a lot of things on this one. What do you miss most about your childhood? Do we ever do that before? No, we have it. Wow, where do we start? Okay, here's what I got so far. Well, some of these wouldn't be up your alley. Like baseball cards I've put that. You know one of the great things about find baseball cards? I can up here and go. Yeah. That dry stick. It was a dry, that great dry flat piece of gum that was out of baseball cards. And it was really powdery and really stickin' and really sweet. And if you like down about like ten packs of baseball cards, which I think he used to be like five since or a dime of pack. So for a dollar, good by ten packs. You had it too. It was just obligatory. If I'll obligate, he shouldn't want to throw it out. That'd be wasteful. So you had it to every stick of gum. You know, and just, right. Fortunately, you could feel the fillings getting yand thread out of your mouth. You're not. They only lots of play rep like five seconds. Baseball cards. Hollywood's your conceded. Halloween. That's your Hollywood. Hollywood. Halloween. Plainsports. Free speech. Oh, I remember that. Comic books. Bubble gum, which not necessarily baseball card bubble gum, which is bubble gum in general. Now, when you get to be an adult, you're supposed to be too smart to be too in bubble gum, right? Right. Spankings. Some of the sign things, some people enjoyed it. Who are just going to school instead of work? See, I remember when I was in school, and I think most people like this, when you're in school, you look forward to that day when you're in Roland, where in school, you don't have to get up in a morning, and go to school every day. And then you realize you're getting the real world, then you've got to go to work every day. And you think, boy, I sure wish I was back in school, you know? Tell me some people. And my old neighborhood. You missed the old hood? Sometimes. Actually, I missed my teen hood more than my childhood hood. I'm potent for baseball cards. Well, I sure enjoyed that. And then you'd flip them in over your friends. Right. I remember when I lost Dutch Leonard, oh, my god. I don't think I'll ever recover from that day. Big fat old picture for our believes it comes. I'm not sure I have 100 years ago. I lost my Dutch Leonard card. 560, 560. Don't you think there's like a zillion other things you missed from your childhood? Yeah, sure. We can't idea that. You have out having no worries. Yeah, or being free. Not having to pay bills. Yeah, I'm just saying that. Yeah, I'm just saying that. Yeah, well, that's basically what you guys are saying. Just interfacing. It's so much better, which is freedom. That's right. Especially, Andy. Huh? Just like freedom in general. Really? Most things that are problem now are other people's problems. Well, do we want to put both of those things, honey? Not having to pay bills. Okay. I like having no worries. Because, you know, you can't be part of the other one. I mean, let's not limit this. Okay. We can put about a thousand choices in there now. Just because the food hasn't showed up yet, don't start getting a little early on. Well, I'll get a little light headed, you know. Yeah. That's what Gregor we said. By the way, time of fear is the movie and the girl thought that we were talking about. Oh, I got the inspoiling ending. This will be for, because you can spoil the ending. It's forget about it. But he says that it is also good and involves the church. This is two hours and 15 minutes long. So it's a fairly long movie. And it didn't end to like a quarter to one in the morning. So if I'm light headed, that's because I went a bit of a little late for this old movie. And it's worth seeing. And it's pretty good. And it's Norton is really great. How many QAM? Hello. Yeah, I got some for Neil Paul. Yes, sir. I want to tell him that Saturday morning got to. Actually, I'm going to vote for you. Thanks, Pally. Hi, Pally. You know, they have a, with the family of theater and Rochester man. I think he was talking about the TV cartoons, but those work too. No, he was nice. Saturday morning cartoons. No. Sorry. Pops, but some of the other of them from the, he's not old enough. He's right. Saturday morning cartoons. I've said he morning cartoons on. Almost done like one channel just literally. And they're not even. See Saturdays. Religously, when I was a kid, we'd go to a friend and I would go to the Kamiow Theatre in Rochester. And like I think was a dime to get in. I remember maybe more, maybe a quarter. And back in those days, when you went to the movies, there were two features. And I started out with a cartoon and the news reel. And then there was the first feature. And then there was like in between. It was like a, a cartoon, a serial. I don't remember the order. And then there was a second movie. You get two movies, the news reel, a serial and a kind of least one. Maybe two cartoons for like a quarter. News reel. Yeah, for real. For real. For real. Israel. Israel. Was real. Surreal. You know what I'm talking about? Were they had a UC? Those patty news and uh, the people who present? Right. That's right. That's right. Present and Truman today dropped in a bomb agrande on those damn jacks. Just like that. Well, it was for the days, man. That was fantastic. The big old Kamiow Theatre. I remember where the hell it is. Or was. Sure. It's not there no more. WQAM. Hello. Well, Neil. Yes, sir. I'd a comment regarding Keith O'Roman. Yes. Do I think he's qualified to report his Boston 100 Detroit 96? Yeah. And why is he too? Is he too liberal for his edit? Found it. How about that read a cause? He's a hotdog. I'm getting. She's uh, so bad that uh, you know, sometimes there's uh, some people hate him. Some people love him. Who could like her? That's a good question. Who would do a turn that thing on and take it seriously? You'd have to think it was a prank. A practical joke. I mean, a voice alone. I've run to the TV. Oh, I can't get a plane about her voice. He doesn't have one. Maybe she got sniped as a child, you think? Oh, man. Ho ho ho. Oh, no, I'll kid yourself. I think she's got this one. Cook about what you think. And even. Neil Rogers. This is 5. 16. … This is Neil Rogers. Oh, the boy. Oh, the boy. This is your brain. Who's your third hero? Any question? Yes, I think you like my shoelaces. When there's a bomb in my shoe, and the melody in my heart, I get that I'm going to take a deep in it, when I grow up late, I'm watching the show's a thrill that's my taste. It's easy to sit too high now. Your light is worth the taking, or my meninges are a reason why, and with a bomb our horizons. I'll do it a wet spot on the sea. I'm not too blind at timing out, I love. I'm not too blind at timing out, I love you. di disguise 11 O 2 of 56 you've already кру i'm appealing Tuesday to ya' Now lets see thisest Wagyu eine semi poth zumity forouse time of fear as opposed to before primal fear seek out into the top is interesting to me because it was good It was y nice what i thought I'd look other it me night See, time affairs a tough psychological thriller thrusting an FBI agent, and a grieving father into the dark world of a demented killer. Empliage and Cheryl Hammer arrives in a small California town of Ketchan, Luc of Killer, seeing no help for coming from the sheriff she turns to the only other person who can help her, Jack Barron. Marron. A grieving father who's daughter Lisa was the victim of a similar 19 years earlier. The killers clues are a perversion of typical punishment for sins, stoning, burning decapitation. The back an agent hammered her into father Patrick, Catholic priest for help, as the clock ticks down a young female friend of Jack's kidnap to maybe come to a scagerty. The harrowing rescue of the young woman opens the door to dark history written below the surface revealing the true identity of the killer ranch in the mystery of who killed Jack's daughter. And also George says American history acts as great with a Norton. Right, the AdNorton can act he doesn't always do that in movies, but in this movie like Best Job Ever. Now he's retracted in a primal fear, I'll take it that on. Cool. See, here's one in Phelms near Vazemir, Phelms near Florida. I never knew there was a place called Vazemir, Florida. It's just I agree with the color for the new poll. I missed the good Saturday morning cartoons. The cheesy badly drawn cartoons now really suck. And I'm an existing, I think like one channel shows you gui, and some of the cheesy crap. Well, Josh was right, having no worries. Although I noticed you didn't put no bills to pay, which I think is the separate. It's part of that one, but it's up for the number. Well, I got several for you to put on there. No bills to pay. Okay, he's in position. Oh, don't tell Duff. My allowance. What, you're laughing, but there's nothing nowadays. Yeah, okay. Some people got it allowance. That's why it's funny. Oh, I see. Well, some kids got one. I never forgot what or not. I don't know. I got something. Dilling my classmates. All right. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Well, here you go. All right. I'll guarantee most of these people had a lot more actual when they were in school than they're getting now. They're so they're married. What do you miss most about your childhood? Having no worries, 21. Playing sports, 12. My old neighborhood, eight. Oh, boy. There are no white people in my old neighborhood, do you believe then? And I was years ago, so I'm sure. I don't think there's even any black people learning more. I'm not sure who does that leave left. They're still our own white neighborhood, because it was the redlands. Freedom five. Oh, remember those days when we all felt so free. Can't like we feel like you were a young. Like we've had a gigantic anchor taken off our ass. Oh, God. Can't you all feel it? I feel it's something. Oh, I'm serious. Sometimes I can hear music. What is that? My sweet Lord. Close. Well, what that is, huh? You know, I'm a little catch up here in a second. Oh, happy day. Oh, everyone, Hawkins singers. Right. Oh, happy day. Well, then our real pleasure, Greg. Are you believing me? Anyway, having no worries 25, 24, 12, 9, 10, freedom six going to schools that are work five, free speech five, which is now only a fantasy, a distant memory. Halloween, for, for, can treat them for baseball cards for a bubble gum too. Comic books too. Saturday morning cartoons won. Spanking is one. I told you. Oh, what are I telling you? There's people out there probably joined little spanking and maybe you're still doing a little bad to each other, dealing my classmates, my allowance, no bills to pay. They just went on there for 77 votes. This is one of the best polls. Thanks again, Sean. I don't want to take credit for Sean. Came up for this our poll man. He is the poll. He is the poll expert man. They come and take a vote. Even I'm not going to have lunch with him. Also, here's another one. Somebody's facts in P. Bro, P. Bro is getting a little chronic on a fast machine. That's okay. P. Bro is okay in our book. He says, believing in Sandy Claus. How about putting that on there? Okay. Maybe in Santa Claus and what about believing in God? If you wish. Huh? I don't see what's good about either one of those two. If you wish upon a star, well, I was fond of believing in Sandy Claus for those who did. Weak wink at night. You know, I mean, how stupid could you be? Did you? Spurr. No, of course not. We didn't have a chimney. How about if he come down to chimney when we didn't have one? I like to keep our butt that crap. Keep our run around up there on the roof. You know, looking for the holder jumped down. He couldn't find it. You want both of those on me? What's that? Sandy Claus and go out there? Or are they the same? I think there's a red similarity. There are some of them that I want to go out there. What do I mean, I realize it's a little less to work for you, Mr. High. I just didn't have that thing. That's pretty good. That's a miserable childhood. That's what you, that's your favorite part. When you were believing in Sandy Claus. I did have a miserable childhood, but I've never believed in Sandy Claus. I wasn't. I didn't want that Santa miserable childhood. I thought I'd be thinking about you. I'm just functional. Yes. Well, I can only speak from my own perspective, man. I mean, I'm sure you never believed in Sandy Claus, but then again, you were raising the Catholic church where they knew how to alter boys. That's kind of strange because the Ed Norton plays a 19 year old alter boy in this movie, which is a little bit old, but the father took him off the street. Oh, you just got to the movie. You just got to see it. I can't wait. Am I going after my conversation with our general man? Good. They am like a one line and just the generosity of my heart. Right, Senator. Where do I get an Amazon.com? Yes. Am I just do that? All right. Now, I think you'll enjoy it. And it's one of those movies you'd like to have a pristine DVD copy of it is supposed to some, you know, cheesy cable version. It's good. Cheesy cable. WCU. They know. Yes. The morning, how about the running under the old Johnny pump and it's summertime. The cool yourself off. The old Johnny pump. The old Johnny pump. Yeah. The old pump. The old Johnny pump. Never heard it called that before. I never heard that. Yeah. Yeah. The old Johnny pump. Anybody have the ever seen Johnny pump? Oh, God. No comment. What is that? Pop, pop, pop. Why? Yeah. I wonder what, what would he grew up? Maybe he's the guy from two wag. I was talking to him about him. Oh, man. But we do know what he's talking about though. We do. How old? Yeah. When you'd run around under the pump to get to cool yourself off on a hot summer day. Of course. In the, like, the fire hydrant. No, not a fire hydrant. It was like, I know what he means. It was like a, like a hand pump, like a well, like on the farm. Yeah. Like that. Like that. Kind of like that. With what? The old Johnny pump. You, you've seen it. I've seen it. You've seen it. I'll be kind of just had a real good one. You keep rambling on with this crap and it made me old. What about, um, uh, I don't know. What about the school playground? Okay. No, you don't mis to playground. I do. Well, there you go. How about recesses. Yeah, ma'am. Okay. There's another one, recessed. It's school playground. Yeah, recessed. The playground. No. No. I'm going to go to playground during recess. Of course you did. What do you mean? Of course. Well, did. Yeah. 100 years since I went to school with Eluano about this. There we go. I'm confused. What are we supposed to study Hall? We need work. Research. So, Lincoln, I'm getting confused between recess and study Hall. Did you ever have a study Hall class? Yes. But that would be nice. Right. In high school yet, study Hall. You'd sit around. You'd just stare at all the interesting people you liked. Didn't do any work here. It's good to be doing your homework. But you were sitting around, I ain't everybody else. I would've done that. Why? I sure I'd a lot of people in my high school. I'll tell you that. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, you've a very carefully though. That's right. Very discreetly. I don't want to tell that story about Jim Park naked in the locker room. Do I? Not again. Well, kill the good time. Oh no. Tell me, do you QAM hello? QAM. Hey, Neil, how are you? Pretty good. When you said the Saturday morning cartoons, I used to love it. I'm sure you remember.

Because in the old days of volunteer fire companies, they'd fight over the hybrid to see we'd get to put out the fire. They'd fight over it. The rookie or the Johnny would be left at the hybrid, he'd have to hook up the hose. Cube. Well, the hose wagon proceeded to the fire. Many of the fighting suit between Johnny's and those had run, stuck to term Johnny pump. I see. And here I thought they were talking about when they were kind of like sprinkling. Like those things you have at the beach, you know? Okay. You know what I'm talking about? Like the, uh, the public showers, the fire. Yeah, it's still like that. But only more crude or versions of them, but anyway, the old Johnny pump. See, we learned something already and who said this is an highly educational show. I see, it feels so enlighten.

About which one about these other? The DC sniper guys. Okay, that's the most famous one. That punk and his stepdad, or his sugar daddy, whatever that was all over the air. Anyway, chicken egg when you see him tell him thank you so much for this book. I never thought I would even pick up the book, but on a plane trip, so I read it. I'm still not through with it.

Anyway, the forward is written by June 4. She was Natasha. I love her. I had the hot for her. Anyway, go ahead. Let's see William Conrad, who is one of my favorites, that's because he was fat cannon. I would like to have a fat detective. But he was great. He was a gay and gun smoke on a radio. He was mad Dylan. Okay. Not the mat Dylan you're thinking about. Okay. Wasn't that his name mat Dylan? I think so. Dawson Butler, Hans Conrad, I love Hans Conrad too. Bill Scott and Paul Freeze with the book is about in June 4. Is the only one still alive. I didn't like that. She got the one shot and she's still alive. Lisa, I think she is. All of the things to me, maybe she's not still alive because this book is a few years old, a couple years.

Not to mention the two visions where I haven't been a fair one of them is the minister's father, Bradley Reigns from guiding light. Who's Bradley Reigns? I wonder what character he plays. I guess I'll have to look that up now. For some reason, the Christians who all have said about this series, some local NBC affiliates we've used, Aaron, I guess the truth really hurts. If he misaligned Friday, I recommend you give it a look this Friday. It's interesting. Thank you, Ray. The book of Daniel. The perverted book of Daniel. What was a lot of beginning and be gotten into beginning going on? Everybody's getting some. I write about that. There's Ted Kennedy. You have church involved.

Yeah, I'm thank God he disappeared. And of course Philip is out there somewhere. We're supposed to forget about that. He's still alive, but I guess the story line didn't go over to big. If he was, if it's the same after it's still flying to the left. Yeah. Yeah. And then he went to him a long time ago. Really? Well, I went on the Saturday night, and like years and years and years and years ago, met, you know, like Justin and he went to Michael. He looks so bad now.

Controversial lobby is said close contact with the bush team. The president signed on to the executive branch health construed the title 10 and division A. In president Bush's first 10 month, I want to give you a little flavor of the Elito hearings. In the first 10 months, the U.P. fundraiser Jackay Bermoff and his loving team log nearly 200 contacts with the new administration as they press for friendly hires at federal agencies and sought to keep the Northern Maryana Islands exempt from the minimum wage and other laws record show. The meetings between the A.B. Moss lobbying team and the administration range from attorney general John Ascroft to policy advisors and Dick Cheney's office according to his lobbying firm Bill and records. A.B. Moss, while we know he's under investigation in addition to the A.B. Moss lobbying colleagues on the Maryana's one political department's inside federal agencies. Our standing with the new administration promises to be solid as several friends of the CNMI Islands will soon be taking high ranking positions of the administration, including within the interior department, A.B. Moss wrote in January 2001 letter that which he persuaded the island government to follow him as a client who was new lobbying from Greenberg Trial rig. The reception A.B. Moss team received from the Bush administration was in stark contrast to the chilly relations of the Clinton years. A.B. Moss then at the press in gates for him scored few meetings with Clinton's and lobbyist and the islands vehemently opposed White House attempts to extend U.S. labor laws to the territories clothing factories. I wonder what can't he leave thinks about that. The records were made from a loss firm obtained by the Associated Press from the Maryana's under an open record request. Chronicle A.B. Moss's careful cultivation of relations with Bush's political team as far back as 1997. In that year, A.B.

I hope you'll keep my office informed on the progress of the country's current July 1897. Let her praising the island's school plan in copying in an A.B. Moss deputy. As for the number of A.B. Moss lobbying team contact with Bush officials documented the building records, White House spokesman Aaron Healy said, we don't know how he defines contacts. Andrew Blom, a spokesman for A.B. Moss to climb comment. The Greenberg Trial rig former A.B. Moss worked between Lee 2000-2004 is investigating A.B. Moss working cooperating with German investigations. How do you like that?

And what I told yesterday. Yeah. Bye bye. It was a little bit. There's a little bit. And that sound no more. In the 50 years that Grant Goodman is known and corresponded with a colleague in the Philippines. He's never had any reason to suspect that their friendship was anything but spectacularly ordinary. But now he believes that the relationship was somehow sparked the interest of the Department of Homeland Security and the agency to place him under surveillance. Last month, Goodman and a one year old 81 year old retired university of Kansas history professor received the letter from the screen in the Philippines. It had been opened and received with a strip of dark green tape varying the words by border protection and carrying the official homeland security seal. I had no idea Homeland Security would open personal letters. Goodman told MSNBC in a phone interview. That's why I learned it in media. I thought it should be known publicly that this is the Lungani said. Goodman originally showed letter to his own local newspaper that Kansas based Lawrence's journal world. I was shocked and there was a certain degree of disbelief in the beginning. Goodman said, well you noticed the letter had been tampered with adding that he felt as privacy being invaded. I think I must be under some kind of surveillance CBC. Goodman is no stranger to male snooping as an officer during WWII. He was responsible for reading all outgoing male of a men in his command and censoring any passengers that might provide clues as to his unit's position. Do you know what your unit's position is? But we didn't do it as cumceley as they've done. I can tell you that goodman noted with no small amount of irony in his voice, isn't that funny that this doesn't appear to be any kind of suraptitious ever to hear he said? The letter comes from a retired Filipino history professor, Goodman declined to identify her. And although the Philippines's only was governments where our screen is a potential spawning ground for Muslim-related terrorism, Goodman said his friend is a devout Catholic and not given the supporting such causes. They don't even go to the hodge. No? Can you tell me what that is? He's not Israeli? What Indiana, can I say? I will say that. They're also up into the hodge. All Muslims that got to go to do that once in their lifetime. Otherwise they're not going to get to 85,000 versions. I do know this once you've gone to the hodge. Yes, they get to call you Haji. Is the hodge like the Taj Mahal? A spokesman for the customs and border protection division said he couldn't speak directly to Goodman's case, but it knows that the agents he can't will undoes open mail coming to the US citizens that originates from a foreign country, whenever it's deemed necessary, phone calls, letters, all of these. And all mail originating outside the US custom territory. That's to be delivered inside the US custom territory. So I've got customs and examination said, I want to hear from Canada to a, that includes personal correspondence. The other is if somebody was to send me some cough drops, they probably wouldn't get here. Probably not. The Paul mail means all mail said John Mohan, a CBP spokesman for sizing the point. All mail means all mail. The process isn't something we're trying to hide. He said, in order to wording on the agency's website, we've had this authority since before the Department of Homeland Security was created. He said, hi, ever. Mohan declined to allow a criteria used to determine what a piece of a personal correspondence should be open, but said obviously it's a security related criteria. Mohan also declined to say how often we're in one volume CBP might be opening mail. All I can really say is that customs and border protection does undertake opening mail. When it's deemed to be necessary, another is whenever they feel like it. All I'm going to add, there's one for that George Rodriguez, well we know he's a subversive, speaks, so we're going to like to open up your mail. That's right. Now, in fact, open up some of our bills and why you're at a pay-a-few. That'd be nice. No, it'd be a good idea. How's the little he's coming? Did you see this Sherry has the responsibility?

I thought, like, a coffee canner is head. That's, that's rocketman. Looks like a percolator. Anyway, we had those cereals and, of course, they would leave you hanging, and you had to come back the next Saturday and they, they only lasted 15 minutes.

You know, I remember this is going to sound really strange. The one of the things I remember from my childhood, I think of my cousin and I, or maybe a friend of mine and I, we used to go around, we'd like a little pale. Okay. No, I'm, I'm serious. And for so long. For pale, uh, pasty face. Okay. For some reason in our neighborhood, there were places where people had, like, I mean, I've ever heard of people bearing money in the ground, but we had a couple of spots where we knew there was, like, all those chains, like, quarters and half dollars and so her dollars and we would like go around and find money in the ground. Don't ask me how, and I'm not making that up, but it's true. Okay. What was that all about? Well, what people doing sticking a bunch of money in the ground? Maybe there were pedophiles, hope, and children would come to try to dig it up. Is that what I don't know? I've never heard of Santa Claus. I'm just telling you, just like the time I found it was 15 or 20 bucks on the ground, uh, by right by the curb and, uh, my and me being. That's what that story. I don't think it was 15. I think it was like 11 or 12 bucks, but it's just how bought me a nice last day. Maybe it was eight bucks. There might have been it. What are the odds of that, though?

In academic panel, investigating the worth of South Korean researcher Fang Wu's suck said Tuesday, he's suck. Oh, no, they said he fabricated data to support his claim that he called human embryos and extracted stem cells from them, campingly spectacular follow-man. What's lot of it is a pioneer? What an idiot, huh? Well, what kind of a jackass does that? The latest revelation by soul and national university panel was another disappointment to scientists and patients who like planes claim of a cloning breakthrough had offered hope to million suffering from paralysis and debilitating diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and AIDS. The same panel concluded last month at flying, falsely claimed in 2005 to develop the 11 stem cell lines tailored to specific patients. Wind did not have any proof to show that cloned embryo understand cells were ever created to panel send to report. The spewed in the central claims in the wings, 2004, people in the paper in the journal science. In the paper, why say the occult to human embryo understracted stem cells from it? But the university can't stop whether an embryo was cloned saying there's a high possibility it could have merely been a mutated egg which could appear to have similar qualities of an embryo. The 2004 paper was written on fabricated data to show that the stem cells matched the DNA of the provider, although he did not. The panel says, however, here's the good news. The panel upheld by his claim last year to equate to the world's first cloned dog and afghan, how name snuffy? Really ugly, too. Afghan hans are ugly to be human. You like afghan hans? That particular? No. The journal nature which fellas finds cloned dog article said that a preliminary results from its independence also showed snuffy was indeed a cloned. That achievement wasn't regarded as important as a cloning of human embryos though because various animals are ready to be cloned. Hello, Dali, and all of that crap. The university condemned the fabrication said they should be punished. This conduct cannot be just seen as an act of fools, the whole scientific community and the public in the report said, just based on the facts of the fabrications that have been disclosed, the penalty has to be severe as in what have been like that. Hang as ass. What do you say? All right, twice. After the break, I want to do a square about the toxic pet food. That is, that is just so pathetic, you know? Did you see it on the news at all?

They ought to be there right there when they're researcher that's hung in it. That's suck guy because they suck. Don't you agree?

Well, you know, because I don't know all some of these guys are, but I kind of miss having sex with other condoms. You know, nowadays, if you're single, you can't do those things. That's her danger, unless you're going to get... No, not to mention, you know, when I was even younger, well, as they would say today, getting molested by my baby's babysitter. You know what I'm...

My God, is that thing real? Yeah. Cuban American Community Activist and politicians land based in US government decision to repay 3815 Cubans picked up from the base of an abandoned bridge in the Florida Keys and urged officials to review the country's Webfoot Drive Food Policy. I wonder if that foot that Vanna was showing under the 80 year old foot on the Wheel of the Screal of Fortune. I wonder if that was a wet foot or a dry foot, wet foot. That kind of looked like it. Yeah, the webfoot Drive Food Policy. If you have a webfoot, you're going back. And attorney for the family's at the migrant city, plan to file a lawsuit today asking a federal judge to allow the group to be turned while a local activist to have a continue a three day hunger strike protesting the treatment of the Cubans. They were Cubans. Cubans and therefore they must come in. We need last more Cubans. The migrants including a two year old and a 13 year old were sent back to Cuba Monday after US officials concluded that the section of the partially clats bridge where they landed didn't count as dry land out of the government policy because it was all unconnected any of the keys. That really is kind of stupid. Yeah. So the whole policy is stupid to begin with. I mean, you know, make up your mind. Not that I want to come down and, you know, on the same side of some of those green teeth lunatics, but through a legal review of the migrants were determined to be feet wet and process feet wet and process the court and so it's standard procedure. It goes through some petty office in Dana Ward, Senate statement. They were feet wet. Having a mic. Oh, my god. There's a Republican administration. You want it so much. US Senator Melmartini is Republican afloat of called the government's decision. Example of the complete nutter of faith. Nothing was pan-re, you understand, course. The complete nutter of the wet foot drive-foot policy, which generally allows Cubans to reach dry land to stay and those who don't be sent home without an immigration hearing. How about a few days like get within like three miles? You know, something like that? Okay. Well, I mean, the wet foot drive-foot is just so stupid. Yeah. It's incredibly stupid. My, what's an old bridging on a new bridge is a judgment. They didn't reach American soil. He asked the semantics used to be Chernysmen and women who've were so much to reach freedom and it will not be turned to one uncertain future. Our embarrassment, Martinez V. Sam. Meanwhile, and of course, you know what would be long before she'd have her, for since in there that bitch. US representative, Alejandro Zanidana Layton called the decision of absurd. If any crown would have been committed on that bridge, the perpetrators who have been arrested and charged with violating US law, she said, the statement. Ross late in spokesman Alice Cruz said the Congresswoman would continue to follow the case, but he didn't immediately know what further action she would take. She's too busy at the gay bars. The group left Montan's province in Cuba laid on the night of January 2nd of a small homemade vote. The migrants were rescued when they were born by the coast guard from the base of the bridge, to South of Merathon Key. Mercedes Hernandez Guerrero, so he initially was elected to receive a call from a niece, Elizabeth Hernandez, telling her that she had her last thing we need anybody else in the name, and then Z, or sorry George, they're probably not. Telling her that she had her husband and their two-year-old son John Michael had reached the bridge. John Michael, I wonder if he's kind of Alan Michael on guiding light. I said stay there, the currents are strong, I thought I was given them good advice Hernandez we call, but her joy to Denise's arrival turned to concern as the days passed, she had nothing from the group. At least it doesn't Cuban Americans protest at the government's decision Monday outside Freedom Tower and downtown Miami. Here we go again. Ramones, howl Sanchez, head of the democracy movement, a real Schmittsisturber, a Cuban American Ivory Group will begin a hunger strike on Saturday to protest the federal government's treatment of the group. So yesterday he wouldn't stop until President Bush agreed to meet with a commissioner leaders in the Cuban Exhaust community about the arbitrary manner in which the wetfoot, the wetfoot drive-foot policies being implemented. I would like to let me ask you, if a bundled hit hit on the bridge and they would have touched the wet spot with that being American soil. Yes, okay. The wetfoot. All right. If they've accepted on it. Sanchez said he's also considered about the Coast Guard's figure to allow those pick-up at sea to contact their families rather being held on the agencies' boats. Votem, people on both sides of the ocean think their family members have died, he said. Sanchez, another said they were especially shocked by the speed of the repatriation. William Sanchez and attorney for all those of the Cuban migrants who planned the final motion asking for the group's return said he was on his way to file an emergency injunction to halt their return when he learned they were already back in Cuba. To light, you know that the Coast Guard's own website states that if immigrants touch US soil, bridges, pierce or rocks, their feet are considered dry. Sounds like something the bridge tender would say. Soil, bridges, pierce or rocks. Yeah. Well, you better know your law, Mr. Right, because they haven't only sure don't because their feet are considered dry, I-I-I-I. But Coast Guard, Lieutenant Commander Chris O'Neill said the structure of the migrants landed on didn't fall into any of those categories. The bridges kind of misnomer said O'Neill's folks went for the department south of each region. He said officials in Washington termed the Cuban city considered feet wet because they weren't able to walk to land from where they landed. See if they just swam a little faster, you know what? Damn it. Or if we're strong. Like that, definitely go. You know, someone come on, you're faster man. Get those feet dry. You wet, wet, wet, wet seat. What, wet, wet, wet? And then what is that? How come the Mexicans give color wet facts and the Cubans are wet feet? I get that all the time. Do you really? Yeah, they don't know. I took a plane but what different does it make? 26 past one, a QAM, it's the more Howard David and the Dodo. Big game show. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62. I think it's hard to think. Here.

We're seeking revenge because you voted against their clients a charge denied by commission members Now the case has back to the commission for a final decision The panel can accept the judges recommendation order the senator pay as much as 17 grand for the 17 election law violations are main after an appeals court throughout the other charges again him if he's unhappy with the commission's next decision The as they laportia could take the case back to what appeals court Noting that the commission staff saw an $800,000 fine against him five years ago the senator called the judges decision a major victory I feel vindicated said the as they laportia But why did you didn't know whether he'll appeal again? The shows that the forward elections commission try to make a mountain out of a mole hill. He said Diaz de la fortia is lawyers that argued that the senator should pay nothing for the remaining 17 violations saying the most of them were technical Diaz de la fortia also argued he couldn't afford to pay the fines but Clark citing documents and testimony provided during hearing advice You're disagreeed Diaz de la fortia's personal living expenses exceed his income clock road No reason the legislation for the opportunity to maintain this lifestyle Diaz de la fortia's net worth will allow him to pay any fine appropriate for the 17 violations of law Where's the money coming from Alice huh inquiry minds one and all where's all that cash coming from?

I give up because it's almost a porom and they had a tray of humontation and They held it about two feet away from the bedside and all of a sudden he was reaching out and touching it Movement of his left hand is significant because the left hand is controlled by the right side of his brain Which was damaged by the stroke he suffered January four There was no immediate danger to the Prime Minister's life said his anesthesiologist Dr. Yoram Weiss metaphorically speaking were right on the edge of the cliff.
