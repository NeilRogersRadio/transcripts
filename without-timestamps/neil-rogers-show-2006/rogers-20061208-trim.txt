She was the ambassador of the UN, of course not. Right. Who plays in the attention? Unless it's John Bolton, who's really revolve. Don't play too much attention to you and ambassadors. But nevertheless. Former dolphin, under a Franklin dies at 47. I remember a Franklin. But even Josh remembers a Franklin not. Never heard of him. No. Well, you better get with you dolphin trivia, Mr. because this is a franchise that was in the past. Just like the Toronto Make Believe. So lost in Gamelized, the Jesus guided his stuff. Today's suck. They're pathetic. And the Appanthus be Buffalo last night. Can anybody believe that? No. To the Rolfer of the Pantheoros. Any interest in the Afflorate Panther Organization? No. Former dolphin, fullback, I'm a Franklin, I guess today and like our Wednesday. Excuse me. And Lincoln, of course, a natural cause is he was 47. I was going to tell him some little bit strange to you, but nevertheless, Franklin's body was found by police that his Lincoln apartment. He had heart problems and other health issues and recent years in front of the surfer from congestive heart failure. See, there's this myth that exists about Jackson about guys. It like work out a lot in our great physical shape. It's said to him, so on. And I come to find out a lot of more like, you know, you know what I'm saying? We say. I'm saying that just because you're like, a big job doesn't mean you're going to live 100. That's right. Franklin played football at Nebraska from 7780. Wreshing for 1738 yards and 10 touchdowns. He was drafted in the second round by the dolphins, the dolphins, and played four years in the NFL. Started starting in a super bowl and appearing on a cover of Sports Illustrated. But his career was short by knee injury. He was done playing by the time he turned 26. Wow. He was divorced, living in Logan Lincoln, where he'd lived for most of the past 20 years. And some AJ played football this season at Emporia State. And his daughter, Miss Shella. Is that how you said? I don't know. Is that an assistant volleyball coach in Northern Illinois? How do I know what you know how you said? Franklin, recently was approved by the NFL for disability. He was prepared to move to Alabama to be closer to his family, but ain't going to happen because he's dead. Under Franklin at 47. David Woodley's dead to a knee. David Woodley. David Woodley. He's dead. I think. Oh, 790. Not on your radio dial, but on our pool. I didn't read the results yesterday, but I'm getting way ahead of my song. Here's the final result that Tagulation of yesterday's pool. Have you ever met anybody? I'm your unit. I'm 1593 votes. No, 602. No. It's just amazing to me. The pool we have today. About the show yesterday. 42.7% didn't hear the pool, which makes you wonder, who are the people that vote on these stupid ass polls? You know what I'm saying? If you know, listen to the show, they're why you're voting on the pool. Although it could be. See, this is that time of the year as you well know. And there are a lot of people out there who's days are, you know, the busy shopping and running around. I get all kinds of crap going on. So they don't have time to be listening to the show, but they do have time later on on the day or whenever to hop online and throw their one cent. Right. Have you ever met anybody on the net? No, 602. Don't chat with anybody online for 91. Yes, it turned out well. 266. Do you connect change my vote? No, I didn't meet Jacob on the internet. Right. Yes, good-and-bad results. 105. Yes, does it last? I didn't meet those other people. My classmates on the internet either, I've met up with them after many, many, many years. It was a good time. Had a good dinner. Yes, it is last year, 79. I hate this pool 34. That's only 2.1% not bad. I hate the internet 16. One percent of the votes from yesterday. I hate the internet. They're on it. They're dealing with it. And they're looking around. You know, but they hate it. Right. No. It's like somebody would say, I hate sex. I'm doing it, but I hate it. I hate it. I hate ice cream. But I'm eating it right now. Like that. Although yesterday after that, very, very gut-wrenching show, I must confess that I got my appetite back. That's the bad news. Okay. Good news was that I got my brain on screen. I've got, you know, everything's back in order again. Got back in the good graces of my close personal friend again, which is great, but nevertheless, I still I eat. Not like tons, but I did eat some ice cream. Oh, don't say that. Because then George gets all over your ass when you say that. Oh, whatever. Yeah, whatever. I had a pint of hog and I was dual-sadial, Lashbag. And it was really pretty weak. I don't even like that flavor, but they haven't even been in and not. Anyway, here's a, before we get into these poll, which is about yesterday's show, which I thought was definitely one of the best ever. Although Josh hasn't said much about yesterday's show. All of he enjoyed it because he enjoyed my pain and say whatever you say about it. Yeah. I go to my hand. And I never, well, I mean, there's no point in having that, you know, vote about who, there's really was no battle going on. It was just like, you know, who was winning the contest to get the sympathy of the audience, but there's no need to be doing that. I'm glad we didn't do it. But we too. Because now everything is like patched up and honky, do we? Let's keep it that way. Everything is just fine. Oh, no. You know the sky, Joe. I'm really glad he sent this. He must be a really good guy. He's a good guy. And there was some nice sort of work to do. And there was some nice sort of work to do. And there was some nice space page. Some really nice and gentle, gentle messages. And on the other hand, I appreciate Joe. Since this, I said, email the George and then George facts it to me. It says, small world. Jacob was my next door neighbor. I voted gutsy. Neil's always had an aura about him as a kind of tough guy. And this was him an horrible situation and totally human. I like Jacob. We've earned many joints together. And I do see him from time to time still. Shouldn't we have that on air? Should I? Oh, damn. We are that's bad. We've earned many joints together. What a surprise. I'm going to tell him he was an idiot and should be in the old man's will right now. I think there's brought Neil a little closer to his audience. He probably embarrassed about those situation. No. But to those of us who were always admiring him, this was a side of him that's never been witnessed in one of the reasons not to our level. I think I like the old man a little more now. Enough said, piece Joe. Thank you, Joe. That was very, very nice. And that's sweet. Yes, it is. Very nice. Good. From Joe, who has smoked a big fat one with some guy named Jacob. Not necessarily my friend Jacob who wouldn't be doing it like that, like that, like whatever. Neil's Thursday show was. We have 800 and three votes that are pulled today and for the weekend. And of course, over the weekend, they're going to be single Thursday. Who remembers that? You know, this is the problem when you put it up the night before. But then again, you get like 2,000 votes by Monday. He's saying, wow, we must have a lot of people listening. Josh is going to be on vacation next week. Do we have any idea who's going to be sitting in there or didn't you just go that with us? Yes, we do. Monday and Tuesday will be Miguel. Yeah. And then Wednesday through Friday will be Chris Wailing. What? Chris is saying. Chris is why he's Wailing. He's Wailing. He's Wailing. He's going to hang out with you for Wailing Wall right now and then later on. He's going to hang out with you. I don't play now. When you work for the beastly, you do a lot of Wailing and balling and just crying like a child. 818 votes. Neil's Thursday show was. Didn't hear it. He's leaning far in a way. 349. 42.6%. I don't get that. Yeah. That's what I was. I was always trying to hurt it. It was all spun. See, that was real. This all is crap about reality TV. There's no such thing. It's all contrived and the rehearsed and BS. This is reality radio yesterday. Don't expect a repeat anytime soon. Didn't hear it. It's 249. It was gutsy. 115. That's what your buddy Joe said. 115. gutsy. What did the best ever 94? That's what I voted. I thought it was a magnificent show. And it's just the way a pen myself on the back and the ass and saying boy, you had some real balls yesterday. It's going to be in such a smuck. What did the best ever 94? It was okay. 81. Not great. Not really. But okay. You know. Kind of a lukewarm. A real backhanded slap on the ass. Fascinating 78. Pondrister E5. Craft. But third man. So many people say yesterday show was craft. So if you take Pondrister E5 that's like 8% out of 8%. Too bad. Spectacular 19. And I hate this whole only 17.2% out of 18. I like that. A rabbit. So that's the offshoot from yesterday. I'm like a, uh, him. Back to being a whatever I am. What are you? Well, I'll let this guess. Yeah, right. An emotional little queen, whatever you want to call him. And I know that there are a lot of people out there saying, oh, boy, what a, what a stupid old, a desk for, you know, whatever I think whatever you want. Okay, just was just laid it out there for you. And you can do whatever you want. You can stick it wherever it makes you feel good. Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean called for another election during the race to replace Katherine. Saying the clear group of public and winner should not be sworn into election questions are sorted out. That's what Howard Dean says. Always like that, Howard. You know, Ronald Swelhoating farewell meeting with Pentagon workers. There he is. He's saying goodbye. Bye bye. Here I'm gearing. You idiot. You cannot see someone if you don't have an election that's valid. The incident they taped in the viewskates over there Sunday on a Tampa area news channel. The same Pete times before the comments and suggestions yesterday. Democrat Christine Jennings is contesting your loss to Republican Vernon Buchanan as soon for a new election on Thursday. Jennings said she'll ask the US House to take the extreme measure of conducting its own investigation in the election. That seems to be part of the course in Florida. Lots of elections, lots of investigations. State officials certified Buchanan is the winner by just 269 votes. Jennings claims that touch screen voting machines in service of the county malfunctioned in district 13 race and possibly cost to the free coneletion more than 18,000. More than 18,000 service of county voters from mark other races didn't have a vote register in the House rights, which of course nobody believes that's possible. Nobody believes it's kosher. Even though there was like a little circle, you next to it. Well, somebody just facts this in from Fort Walton Beach. Paula Barstow, singing sand is stopped singing after how the event was pulled out of his power cord and ran over his head. Baby Jesus was with her the cut out of the shell of our Presbyterian church's wooden activity display. I hear all the time that Jesus has been taking on everything and now he's been in the church's manager. Church elder Linda Sheely told the Northwest Florida Daily News. Jesus and the singing sand were perfect for him as a holiday crime spray. Oh no. Barstow said Santa was in his usual spotter in driveway Tuesday next year. Both ones they found him a mode down. Oh, let's go mode down Jesus or Santa. Or both. They had to come all the way in and just run over him back for him back in for Santa Barstow. Who cried if she described the damage. Santa was an evil guy. She said he also waived and shouted, Mary, Christmas. Sheely discovered the missing baby Jesus on Tuesday. Her husband George Huff is settled in the activity scene. People should be taught not to steal anything but don't take the baby Jesus for crying out loud. Don't take the baby Jesus for Christ's sake. I mean, just like that. 836 votes on the pool and 42.3% of the audience didn't hear yesterday's show. Can you explain that to me during the break? Think about that and make up an explanation.

He's a distant second in my book As many as 84 people in seven states have been confirmed is having the strain He turned right back to me involved in an outbreak that maybe linked to Taco Bell restaurants officials today and that's really sad because I love my Taco Bell I love Taco Bell Hmm I have nothing to eat. They're very often and I've got one very close by me, but I just I don't know I'll decide on a mind you don't know me. What do you mean? I don't know. South Carolina and Utah are the latest states report outbreaks of the illness state and federal agencies are still trying to pin down the source But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the vast majority of the before the cases have eaten a Taco Bell restaurants prior to their illness Dr. Greg Grayton and the CDC told CNN that his agency and state health departments haven't seen any other sources of the illness and are zero onion on Taco Bell Suppliers of green onions now excuse me for my ignorance and there are a lot of things that I don't know but the good part of it is George knows them all or at least he makes them up. That's right I thought that those are like scatians. That was the difference between green onions and scatians. I do believe they're the same But no seriously. I don't know. I don't know. I can say that a Google ad, okay Google scatians I'm trying to say something that why did they call green onions because some people call them one thing. Yeah, I should be wrong. There is no song called scatians or even heard it's gang Well, maybe they will be now. We have some leads that say it might be green onions. That's based upon some permanent retesting It's been done and you know what else? We're using a lot of us guys is in like Chinese restaurant sure And especially in Superman and want in want and soup and hot and sour into winter everything It is the same as green onion. Well, see I've put it for once in my life. I got a ride and that's based upon some preliminary testing It's been done in a number of labs right now, but the testimony has not confirmed So we're keeping the options open. It's in the investigations that we're doing of becoming a wide range of foods all of them served at Taco Bell specifically Braiden said Jean per Packford is dead. I'm your friend. I'm still alive. I'm still kicking after that emotional traumatic Outpouring yesterday was a wonderful thing a great catharsis the only problem was I got my appetite back and I feel great Neal Thursday show was didn't hear it's 269 42.4 percent out of 869 votes Wow, what were these people doing?

I was took good care of me at family bank and took care of all all kinds of good stuff My banking needs it is right well, you know you know how it is there all these see that's that's another reason why it was so I don't want to say gutsy because it sounds so self-indulgent, but it was I'm my part to tell a whole story not only because I made a fool out of myself for like you know going overboard see one thing about me and you know this I'm just not one of those people that's easy You know in other words. I'm not like you you're a social butterfly everybody in the station George is first if I have a screw down You know, he's like all over them like stink on joy. Yeah You're you're like sociable. I'm not a sociable person I don't make any apologies for that you are whatever you are. I don't I don't Polozetta that that that that's not because I'm a bad person I'm just not interested in being everybody's best buddy or coming in schmoosing with everybody, you know So as you well know right But if I do Find some kind of a Connection with somebody else. I just go overboard Because they just aren't that many people in my lifetime. I've been that crazy about and this isn't to do with sex Because like I said the other day with my you know, I'm doing just fine. Okay I don't need to know your name. I don't need to know your shoe size. I don't need to know anything else just If you look good to me and you're ready to do something.

Well, I was thinking we could call it gay But right it's gonna be a day But anyway, and so He kept the owner of the station. I thought it was true before you call it cats and time is not dead He kept around the phone all day so she wouldn't hear the show up. Oh, nice going said Because it was afraid of what her reaction might be but it turned out okay. I guess it wasn't such a bad mistake after all The only thing with that is though when you go on the year and you tell something like that yesterday right away the homophobes out there Which is the majority of people? Even even people who like to show like me whatever They're still like oh gee what are you? I control a bag. Yeah, whatever Whatever you want to think that's fine with me. It doesn't make a video difference to me 900 two votes on the pool and 42.4% still didn't hear the show yesterday Well, I'm gonna send you out of much of the field man, but you Mr. Really interesting show fascinating a gut wrenching Amazing for our special last three hours WQAM hello QAM Wow, you can tell the holiday season, huh?

Oi The Americans will learn what it is to live with terrorist after the plane hit the twins in September Haas is contact city heard more than they say after 11 months of desperately attending to alert the authorities being systematically ignored all along the line The contact watched in horror is the tax unfolded exactly as he'd overheard House reveal on the air they even asked by a we did a contact the source who has asked to remain anonymous for fear of his own life as he had In depth information about prior knowledge it attacks and nobody will listen to him Hostated I've purchased individual zifist story was BS, you know, that's a kind of how I had to approach it is this guy might be a nutcase Less follow through and see if history starts to have any merit and it did He said our reach to program our photos though this guy has some information based on his documentation and it smells more like a cover up to me The source also told Hans that one of the many overheard express concerns We're guiding whether the upcoming presidential election of ever 2000 between bush chaining and Gorleberman could impact the plans Another man he believed to be of the most senior the three replied don't worry We have people on high places no matter who gets elected they will take care of everything The source also reported to Hans that he overheard one of the three men say the Arabs are so stupid They don't even imagine that we are using them Could this be a reference to landlub and hijackers question mark? It certainly fits other evidence that they or their doubled sized names taste depending on which line you take We're immediately no new us and tells it until we're being used as Patcies likely Harvey Oswell, you know, I'm a patty member then ever patty client on the patty Houses received copies of letters that is contact for received from the FBI after emailing calling them Then they had important information to share a first letter advised the source to contact the new work FBI division Which he did several times got no response upon writing the FBI a second time a further response inform the source The FBI would not be able to do anything on his behalf On the same day the second letter was received three months prior to nine love and two agents from the Newark Division visited the source Without a guarantee of protection he was unwilling to tell everything he knew However, he did tell the agents there would be an attack in the earth city their planes would be used Haas suggests that it is telling that the source was asking for protection Fear and that he had in sound information on some form is really intelligence operation and the FBI was advising him to contact his local cop The source told Haas the Newark agent seemed to rather annoyed that the high-reshylons of the FBI were outright We're objecting to receive information on the protection We previously highlighted how many of the divisional branches of the FBI were hinted or prevented from investigating red flags or warnings before The night-loving attacks we've also specifically highlighted the Israeli four warnings par knowledge and possible involvement in 911 We've gone over these issues so many times in the past that we know get accused by newer readers and critics of ignoring them and some are protecting his very intelligence And truth we were talking about this stuff hours after the attacks took place and four years in the aftermath this says on prison planet The source of the sources stories suggests is he himself believes that the real perpetrators of 911 may have been a conglomeration of intelligence agencies involving the Mossad He believes there may be even a direct connection to the story with the Israeli spiring and the fire is really tourists to rest in 911 2001 after they were seen in position on nearby rooftop before to plan to and celebrating afterward Even Senator Bobby Graham on the intelligence committee after 911 stated there's evidence that's Existy attacks were funded in part at least by a sovereign government this information has been classified We also know that the end of the Pakistani intelligence the ISI $100,000 to the lead high-jacker right before the event The umptious ISI which of course is in bed with the CIA Pass one on to comment what made it so fascinating was that I decide okay When the start trying to confirm this guy's story Once I confirm the FBI agents existed I mean some of this story if you think about somebody making up a story identifying FBI agents Is you know it's not like when you go to your local police for website and they have pictures of all the police You know, I didn't have a then the of agents is something you have to go to great lengths to fabric ABC and it goes on Move more it's got all the documents here It'll be on our website tomorrow some prison planet today Info wars.net Of course, I know we're all paranoid and we're all suspicious and cynical and yati adiada who would whoever believe the government or any government would be I never do anything like that 918 votes on the poll will have that thousand look at each split and 42.3% of the voters under didn't hear the show Maybe they did maybe the people online don't even listen to the show they just vote on the poll That's positive they read the laws on the poll and then they've heard the show in their life Make sure to ask them.

They hit me with five shots And I'm still alive that was such a great scene. You know for his with Tom Hagan And he gets the So let's message say I was gonna say gets the gets the call but of course back in the day there was no cell phone Yeah It's very hard to even imagine back in the day when there was no TV back when there was no cell phones back when they're Saying that would be like a poor way No microwave ovens that would be an excellent pull someday. In fact, we go do that next week. We're not words About what what modern convenience or whatever can you least imagine? Right because you know what you know far like me you don't remember living before there was any TV Correct. That's when people use the list of new radio What's that Here's the fact that says just wondering if you heard about Thomas Friedman back tracking on the support for the rack war on I'm a saw He was wrong about supporting it and cheerlead Thomas Friedman's an idiot. Okay, a real far bison He then said we should sit a date and leave. He also banks bush. It was pathetic. It relates to never Says love you and he'll say how to judge and Josh P. As please by the bit where we turn to rack over to the Iraqi Boy when he remembers the name of it By the way as far as far as the last part of this is which I'm not gonna read on the air. No, I've already wrote Look at us. No, he does not. I say, so all you all you a versus Christian more. So I think I'm not as suspicious about people as some you know Did you read the last part of that last sentence on it? No, that's not the case 1056 and 560 WQM This is the Neil Roger Oh Why's the night before Christmas the whole house was narrow not a creature with spirit Because I had my gun under the pillow when I found a roof and heard something No, keep it down when what do my wonder and I should appear but the dawn of all else any Frick and rain be Because you shout it leave me call my name Your tone your friend your Joey your video a boy even he'll go big widow Which respect back right here and a red silk suit don't Christopher was he any brock the loot Has I drew out my gun and you'd buy the bed he flew through the way No, you're getting his call you freaking moron. Then point in a finger right up my nose He twisted his pinky range and up the chimney. He wrote Then I hate him no one I wish to expect it married freaking Christmas alone and your better show from your spirit It's 1102 at 560 WQM. She just wanted to get sober and blah blah blah like that 174 votes on the pool were getting really close to a thousand man and son Friday the week before about two weeks What is it eighth her 17 days before Christmas day? Nick Patio and he says read the Bible If nothing else regentuses and then ask yourself a rational person Could actually believe that these are literal historical stories about our human ancestors and roots creation I'm talking about Adam E. Kain Aval Moses, Noah and the rest A recent poll taken by Rasmussen reports indicates that most Americans 63% believe that the Bible is literally true in the word of God The survey found it just 24% think otherwise Aside from all the scientific proof that the bunch the Bible's literal account of the world's history there's a more pressing question my mind The Bible immerses the reader in stories where God is always popping up in person He's single handedly catches Adam E. Kali for a bit in a fruit He tells Abraham the sacrifices son to prove his love. He speaks to Moses in the form of a burning bush He gives Noah the blueprint for an arc and the new testimony sends his son to die for our sins and he speaks directly to Christ a couple of times too If we're to believe the Bible God was much more direct than the old days he was personally involved My question where has he been during the last two thousand years? Even jolt will say he still speaks to us every time we pray and read the Bible Some environmentalists say he speaks to nature and all its wonders others find him in their loved ones and within their own souls Atheists say he didn't exist then he doesn't exist now to which I would say Today if someone says God is literally speaking to them they end up on Is I per se or one of several other anti-cycotic drugs in some cases they get their own TV show make a fortune collecting from the gobble If the Bible is the literal truth and we must ask what happened did God die? Did he abandon us or is he actually speaking to us through Pat Robertson? Wouldn't that be the ultimate kick in the head? I don't have the answer I believe to my core that anyone who thinks he or she has the answer a fundamentalist of any stripe is Dealuted. Dealuted as in But what not like that? I Refusibly that God once so middle some in people's lives according to Bible accounts has changed his to do list so drastically No more walks in the garden no more slew like pursuits of brother killing criminals like cane no parting of the seas No direct instruction of where and why to move like Jacob and Moses receive and how long has it been since anyone's been turned into a pillar of salt for this obedience Except Joyce Has God changed his ways? Resist more compelling of it instead the Bible stories about God's interrational mankind are not literal truth Bible stories don't just depict the God we know from my experience God leads it to our own judgment and will as to whether we believe or not He never literally appears in my garden or bush burning or otherwise If I choose to sense his presence around here within me, that's my own experience in my personal perception And as nothing do with the Bible, it's between God and me in other words Still God I can't say you wanted I can't deny your experience of the nice or affirms God's existence But quite sadly history continues to tell us that as long as people believe that their religion or holy book is the literal truth We'll never make progress to a peaceful world The holy books of each and every world religion we're never meant to be read as literal prose. They are poetic Strip away the tales and myths you'll discover that they're all they all are for the same guidance for living love one another Take in politically Christianity has a place for everyone to do and let me say it again Take in politically Christianity has a place for everyone as to all the other religions Example the gospel of Luke tells us that Jesus was not God's only son and Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age Being as was supposed the son of Joseph which was the son of hell. I had said with center which was the son of Adam which was the son of God But the new testament gives much more detail about Jesus being the only son of God can see through the holy spirit by the virgin Mary Now only Christians run board for this part of the story and fundamental start convinced that if you don't accept Jesus You simply go to hell when you die wouldn't be healthy to teach our children the Christ came to earth to teach us how to live everyone who believes in God can accept at least poetically That Jesus is the son of God just as Adam is the son of God and if Adam is the son of God Then we all are and then there are some we're just a son of eight well fit And everyone who's a living Christ like who is living a Christ like life could get to see them or probably even if they don't actually believe in Christ This notion that you can drown your kids in the family bathtub go to prison accept Jesus and then be back on your married way to an attorney and heaven is ridiculously out of whack People that believe this stuff also believe that a Jew who feeds the poor cares for the sick and loves his neighbor is going to help because he has an accepted Jesus Yusky This is what Bible literalists are teaching their children Bible pros over Bible poetry It's a mechanical mental exercise and religious training that embraces the letter of the law The expense of the spirit of love and compassion at the root of Jesus teachings Because no matter what anyone believes every same person agrees that there's something mystical about love Then in a perfect world we would We would do one of what this is we will often to do one of us and then respect for our fellow man would be the ideal Jesus preached this Buddha talk this yes even though I haven't shared these principles This is the poetry of the message Spirited details of the stories that present a spiteful jealous God who separates and devise and if anything You read your holy book leads you to judge condemn or harm your fellow man in any way rip it out and burn it Take your Zip presson you can be sure that it's not God that's been speaking to you and that cute. That's good. Yeah, that is take is I've pressed a pop a couple out pop a few more Pills rush. What was he taking oxies? He's taking oxies Trump Trump He's a champ on it. Trump on this rush on second thought Well, I don't see there and can get anymore on CNN, you know that not for a long keep passing next year Maybe she's pregnant If she if she has rushes baby, remember Rob Rosemary's baby. Come on. I've been a one. It's alive It's alive. Can you see rushes? Oh, he's out. Whoo I bet you it's got a mustache in a hero.

Pumpkin is from humpkin is from humpkin is from humpkin look at the candy. Rectom. 16 to 5, 60 W to Q.A.M. And of course I'm re-reading this email from your buddy Joe. You're close personal buddy Joe. I don't have I ever met Joe. I don't think so. I'm just curious because you seem to know him so well. And most of our lives. I told you he showed up for a couple of appearances before. Shook my hand. And off he goes. I'm re-developed that thing about smoking the joints with Jacob on. I certainly hope that Jacob doesn't think that when we're going to be meeting for lunch, I'm going to be like number big fat when you know. That I'm into this marriage or we need something big fat. Marriage or we need. Well, maybe part of that. The whole man's security departments newly revealed computerized research assessments of international travelers may violate a specific van that Congress imposed as part of the agency's budget of what it passed here. And we were talking about that ATS crack. The automated targeting system where they're going to like find out how much of a risk you are. Of course in your case. Oh, goes without sand. Some members of Congress in privacy advocates yesterday questioned the equality of automated targeting system or ATS risk assessments that have been assigned to millions of Americans for foreigners who entered the left of the US over the past four years, a or is that USA? It certainly goes contrary to what we have in law represented Martin Sabo, and I'm going to sort of send an interview. I want to be a skin to water Sabo for a sake, I sure hope not. I'm going to leave water Sabo all my money in my will when I die. You have a question. The ATS is the kind of computerized risk assessment we've been trying to prohibit. Homeland security chief Michael Chirtoff, the Uxious Beardive Goop ball, told the AAP. I don't think the prohibition can be read as a plan to this program. The U.S. News Agency doesn't borrow the use of funds for the purpose of analyzing the risk for people entering this country. The Department spoke to him, Russ Nake, not Nake. I wonder if he was kidding. Russ Nake said Congress was in four many times since 2003 that ATS was being used to access to access to access people. Can I ask you a question? The AAP report last week that ATS have been accessing millions of people since 2002. At that time, a law prompted by the attacks of 9-11 required air and cruise lines to give the home and security home and security department advanced data on all passengers and crew and weighing and leaving the country. Jason Fee, a. her an assistant commissioner of customs and border production told AAP, the law passed her data's analyzed by ATS data on rail and some land fair was also been assets he said. A lot of assets in going on. ATS is operated with little public notice from understanding until the description was published last month on the federal register, a fine print company in the federal rules. The Homeland Security departments and notices people could not see their assessments or directly challenge them. The law is a state-owned policy that has been the largest company in the country. The law is a state-owned policy that has been designed to keep the assessments for 40 long-freaky years and share data with state-loaf and foreign governments for hiring, contracting, licensing other decisions and some instances data could be shared with courts and private contractors. Say well the top democrat on the House of Prophears and Semperman in Homeland Security. Road into the agencies spending bills they ban on computerized passenger risk assessments for the past three budget years. whose names are not on government watch list TVC. Say well said they keep going off on these wild scenarios on a regular basis. They should concentrate on making their watch list comprehensive and correctable. Senator Patrick Lee, he of a amount agreed. There's a growing concern in Congress that says program invites abuse and that the administration is following a head with it and a parent violation of the law said that Lee, he member of the counterpart subcommittee in the Senate and coming chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Uncle Sam is watching you. You're risk they got a microscope on your ass and they're watching here move over movie may. I like that they're sniffing every fart you couget. This doesn't make them sure that's reading the right ingredients. Or whatever that is you have some kind of subversive craft in your system. There's nothing worse than a subversive craft out to that. Oh, 185 votes on a poll 41.7 percent. Didn't hear the show yesterday. And you know what? You know what? Then I look at that? They're lost. Yeah. You know what I mean? They're lost. A spectacular show of real gut honesty and truth and outpouring of emotion and you know whatever. It's there in the archives that they want to hear it. Neal Thursday show was I didn't hear it 453.41.7 percent a frightening number out of 1,085. 1,085 that means we're going to have 111 by 111 111 by 111 or 112 by noon or whatever it is. Who cares? You don't care. I finally admitted that too. I don't care. One of the best ever yesterday 115. Could anybody dispute that? Nope, not me. It was okay 112. Fascinating 99. Ponderous 54. It was craft 39. How do you like that after all that outpouring of emotion 39 people say was. Really hurts me that a quick not. Spectacular 29. It was gay 22. And I hate this full 22. But was gay only because I am you know. No, it was a good idea. If it had been a woman or an ugly guy, it wouldn't have gone down that way. Well, that's right. And of course I admitted that it wasn't that case and there was not any. I know where it looks at the second time anyway. Look at all the ugly guys that have come to those talking games. And that's the day weren't nice people. I think they weren't friendly or people that I appreciate them coming by and listening to the show. I don't respect everybody who listens to be a great looking guy. I know. Follow what I'm saying. Not anybody who listens can look like Brady Quinn including Jacob by the way, but nevertheless. It's just that if somebody comes by who I, you know, look at this. Here's a bunch of people sitting. What are they doing? It looks like they were sitting in slot machines, but they're not. See that goes to share where my mind is. Oh, they're voting. Wow. What are you trying? What are you trust more? Stop machines are voting machines. Oh, geez. Slots are easy one. Yeah, at least they're regulated. At least once they're voting. Package. Well, what they isn't Friday? It's Friday. What kind of a package would that be? Well, I'm a financial answer. Government will change is not coming legislation from the new Congress may bring an end to paperless electronic voting. The New York Times enforce in its editions today. By the 2000s, presidential election voters around the country are likely to see sweeping changes and how they can't still balance another's balance are counted right in or being a and Christopher Drew, including an end of the use of most electronic voting machines without a paper trail. Wouldn't that be great? Coating federal voting officials and legislators are being a and Drew report that New Government guidelines and bills in Congress will probably combine to make paperless voting machines obsolete. Good. For the first end of the article says vote counting software will also be inspected by government authorities and the code could be made public. Additionally, states and counties that vote voting machines will have to modify them to hook them up to printers while others are planning to scrap the machines and buy new ones. The article quotes the director of elections website is saying in the last two years, we'll see the kinds of sweeping changes that people expected to see in the 2000s election. The difference now is that we move from politics down to policies. Exhibit some of the regular election. It says motivated and part by voting problems during the midterm elections last month, the changes that the result of a growing skepticism among local and state election officials federal legislators and the scientific community about reliability, reliability, of the paperless touchscreen machines used by about 30% of the American voters. Many of these machines were brought in a rushed overhaul of voting systems under the speed of election of 2000 and issued those hanging chads, baby. Chad is hanging it. But concerns have been growing that in a close election to paperless machines gave election workers no legitimate method of conduct or recouder to check for malfunctions or fraud that it did it fraud. Several counties around the country already considering scrapping their voting systems after problems this year and last week, federal technology experts included for the first time that paperless touchscreen machines could not be secured from possible tampering. The changes will not come without a struggle. Stating local election officials are still reeling from last major or how the country's voting system initiated by the help America vote act in 2002 and some say that $150 million in federal aid proposed by hope would not be near enough to pay for the changes. In other words, it's still on a fixed all the elections and growing a tough. But at least no more people is, we gotta have that paper trail, baby. That's like having a paper trail. The $590 votes on the pool will have $1100 by the top of the RR. No, you're not. 41, 41, 0.6 though to inherit. I mean, obviously I put that on there because it's kind of interesting statistics. Isn't it kind of like a fly opener? But the fact that a matter is, I'm much more interested in the people who did hear the show and hear their tape as opposed to people who didn't hear it. You know what I'm saying? What do you think about that fight last night? Well, I didn't see it. Well, the one you're going to tell me, and then they still haven't opinion. Then again, that's life in South Florida. That's people in general. Appearance are like butts. Everybody's got one. They used to be able to say something else. A-holes. Well, that's it. But that's it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, and look at this. They did not have the respond. When I told them that I would put the best cover in my will and it's because they don't fully manned the right. Of course, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. And pound five and additionally, what kind of a stranger would take money from somebody they don't even know at all? Much less somebody they, you know, hardly know. Well, it depends on what kind of a string was attached to it. No strings attached. And I forgot to see any of these people hopefully not. Although there might be some people out there in the audience, I wouldn't mind seeing, but then that's another story. And then there might be string attached and they might run like a son of a bitch. W-2-2-2-1, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. Oh, okay, good. There's one of them. I'm putting him in my will right now. Alright, I'm leaving it all. I'm hanging it all out there for a month and a line. This thing is working again by the way, the way to show you. And that's because I put it in my mouse pad. Good. What was that a better idea? Yes. Because it was like kind of slopped over there. My little box with the 12-Lines on it. I think like the one you got there that probably doesn't do in it. Oh, that's like it works. Does it work? Just the computer doesn't. I see. Well, now you're getting picky. Oh, I'm working at studio. It's the Beesley, I can't wait. And by the way, if anybody yesterday heard me the show on top of that I'm a crazy person, I am. I work for the Beesley's. Although I'm pitting and by the way, the trick showed up on the 7th yesterday. Thank you to the to Deb and accounting and a Joe Bell for working on that and getting to tang. Even I thank Clarence this morning, which I think I see Clarence here to show you. He thought it was funny. Thought it was great. But he thought it was funny. Do you think it was funny? No, not funny. No, I mean, it was a lot of other things you could like many other words you could you. But certainly wasn't funny. Well, I guess he enjoyed my pain. You know, we heard about how painer. And maybe if I have a lot more pain, Clarence, I have a lot more days off and George can do the show like four or five days away. I'll be emotionally crippled. Maybe even plunging a wood blind. Actually, what's there? I don't think there wasn't. I didn't go anywhere. I went over to the convenience store got my newspapers and my soda and that was it. I just laid out like an emotional cripple. I could hold a washerwoman man like a silly old lady. Span a silly old lady. He's been like a lady. I did during part of his reign.

I'm listening to the show when we asked to pull about the colors, you know Who knows how many of those people aren't even listeners offering some stupid ass opinion follow what I'm saying Uh-huh just think about that for a while for about half a minute W 2 a.m. Hello QM yes Speaking yes Good Whether why What about it?

Nobody who have that was by request from our listener in derail who said the show was heartwarming Although we don't have any votes for our woman yet, and that's that's a little bit too a survey for our crowd They don't want to pee on me that much you know what the The Reverend speaking of that the Reverend Ted Haggard this week formerly begins his long journey tour recovery from a drug in peace And force them to step down as one of the most influential evangelical leaders in the nation. They're all full of crap Haggard 50 has turned himself over to a team of counselors who are assessing his spiritual emotional and mental conditions The Reverend H.B. London What if he's kind of Ryan London Who's helping me guide Haggard to the process? London and two other passes will those that a rigorous restoration plan Recraming Haggard to spend hours each week in counseling Bible study prayer and soul bearing talks by phone or in person with his mentors Maybe that's why I had on the show yesterday soul bearing talk you think it was buried. I was bare The teams first asked me to push Haggard to announce any additions and come to an honest understanding of his sexuality Ted is not in touch with me. All these said the Reverend Mark Howard or friend the mentors can confront Haggard or revu-come Forcefully and he also asked him to submit to a polygraph test Ted says he's not a homosexual said the Reverend Mike were a good friend the restoration team at one experts That to evaluate that and that's gonna require a whole panel of people to figure that one out the finger it out Haggard's high-profile ministry collapsed last month after a male prostitute when I'm talking radio to a legend that the pastor regularly paid him for sex over the last three years Mike Jones who advertising gave publications as a masseur and his ugly is my ass Also said he had seen Haggard take methane fedamine. Oh Haggard denied the accusations at first but when Joan produced two voice ea Evoic male messages from Haggard the passage of city and hide the prostitute from massage and it purchased meth only the throw it away And letter to his congregation Haggard admitted that he had succumbed to desires that were what I say succumbed to desires that were contrary to everything I believe in teach. I'm a deceiver and a liar Haggard wrote absolutely there's a part of my life that is so we pulse of in dark That I've been worrying against it all my adult life Haggard resigned as president the National Association of Evangelicals a powerful post that brought him in frequent contact with a White House He was also dismissed as senior pastor of new life the church He founded his basement group of congregation of 14,000 Since his public confession Haggard has concluded himself with his wife Gail and they're five children Those close to him say he's humble to shamed and grieving yet prayerful that the scandal might strengthen his family in his faith It seems to be a time of hope since Carolyn Haggard is niece New lives trustees are working on a servant's package to sustain Haggard who earned about 440 grand a year and his wife Horned about 50 grand a year for work with women's ministries a associate pastor Rob Bendell said the Haggard is also received a generous outpouring of gifts from congregation members and fooding donations Well, he can if you read a call those messurers, you know Could have cost a lot of money Those post to the restoration will not say whether Haggard will undergo therapy to try to eliminate same sex attraction He's gonna want to go therapy to try to eliminate same sex attractions. Maybe a lobotomy But the conservative question leader the umptuous James Dobson a close friend to say the healing process Which could last years will probably end to eliminate any homosexuality When it doubt life it out my for cleaning Well, white evangelicals as a group tend to view homosexuality is a lifestyle choice not an inborn trait because they don't the ranch for my elbow With 50% of six percent holding that sexual orientation can be changed according to a poll taken to someone by the pew for a Mon religion public life back in pairs in the same poll showed 31% of Catholics in 22% of white man on Protestant belief that changes possible They should lose so long In addition which who wants to change ever besides Reverend Ted In many evangelical congregations many women with same sex attractions are expected to use prayer and Bible study Delphemy's just a temptation to sin Haggard comes from a charismatic finish and it puts a special emphasis on the devil's corrupting influence He has described supernatural versions of demons waiting to affect newborns with sinful desires Demons the devil may be do it with a pitchfork and a tail The theology of constant spiritual warfare is what some of his followers to blame Haggard's fall not any personal weakness But on Satan's cunning that's Satan man. He is cunning watch out for his wicked ways As congregation member Jan Long 60 put it the enemy wants to destroy us the beast You know the beast I want to destroy such constructions where the Reverend totally can't pull away liberal evangelical leader who helped God President Clinton spiritual restoration after the monocopusiness the idea that this is a matter of some evil spirit Taking a little misleading to Haggard for a disaster he said he may have a tendency to pretend that he's been delivered from his homosexual feelings and all as well Can policity hope the restoration team would have press upon Haggard? There is no easy fix these are problems so struggle with for life for a lifetime That's so we're just problem a lifetime Haggard has been more liberal than many evangelicals on gay rights issues for example he backs domestic pardon partner benefits He has preached unequivocally the homosexualities in moral and those who persist in same sexualizations will not be welcome Envives kingdom. I guess what some of us would rather be with the devil have it a good time His restoration team largely shares this theology includes two veteran pastures of evangelical mega churches The Reverend Jack W. Hayford 72 of An eyes and Reverend Tommy Barnett 69 of Phoenix both pastures like Haggard Draw on the charismatic tradition including speaking in tongues. I V Wow The third member of the team love and success Mancels and vice president of Dawson's conservative ministry of folk. Ocas focus focus focus on the family Which for what's therapy to help gays must be in change their sexual orientation? Maybe some of us might want to have I got an idea. I just had an inspiration from this how about some therapy to help say it change some head of a sexual From their sexual orientation Not that I have anybody in mind. How's that sound? Yeah, you're gonna start a program. Yeah, I'm threatened my own program. It's a hands-on deal As director passed a lot reach for the Colorado Springs Base Ministry London's council hundreds of clergy with a minute moral failings up to have to make it to the rehab They grow weary of the regiment and drop out. He said those who stick with the process of them feel almost Unbearably isolated many of run for years on the adrenaline that comes from power and recognition and suddenly it's gone one and said the phones not ringing people don't need you Like us the phones that while phone is ringing I'll get to you when I feel like it the restoration team Notting to return hungry to ministry addressing the new life combination last month his mentor the Reverend Larry stocks to later a much more modest goal For past your tent of recovering up to serve God with joy with dignity and hope in his heart the congregation We spotted what a standing-ovation all right lives here forever and ten Faggot I mean Whatever the second yeah 1149 boats on the pool we got all backup over 42 again didn't listen to the show yesterday 42.1% don't you feel really bad and depred help I Don't either but they should they should they should they should for you really down the dumps and by the way heartwarming slides no votes.

I don't know Governor Bill Richardson Democratic domestic always told the universe Fox news that he's running from president in 2008 That's what they said that was a story they put on but then come to fight out according to Rosjory That Fox news incorrectly reported that he was running and he's not I've dealt with the issues that are very important today National Security immigration energy Richardson said I didn't know that he felt his Latino heritage will help us campaign Running as an American was proud to be Hispanic and Yadiyadiyani, but of course come to find out that it was incorrect Because Richardson's office since the lie that he feared his candidacy That's a fox news here to anybody else. So they just make it up as they go along a fox news unfair unbalanced and full of crap 233 votes we already just did that But I'm just the thing about the 42.1 percent that is just I'm actually that even the audience out there just shell shocked Because we've been doing these polls for how long about 200 years now Yeah, I think that What did I start doing to show is here was it March? Yeah See I came up here you want you recall that whole episode about the re-rextending my deal and hold it on Greg waited I was coming up here for the weekend and Greg waited until 1230 which is when I was leading you were doing 1232 and he waited It's like 1220 to come in there to give me the sign the thing like a schmuck like he is And then I come up here and I had a find a place so they could put a studio in here I was gonna buy a place and I was very lucky just a miracle that I found this so I actually rented the place in November Five years ago and then I started doing a show in March So in March it'll be my 31st anniversary would be five years doing most of the show is from Toronto Hello now all of the shows if anybody thinks I'm doing any shows down here Never I told Joe that he said okay You can do the show for more of you want do it from your latest Five six seven I could do it for my home in plantation Have a guess for lunch every day five six seven oh five sixty and Pond five sixty for rotten and singular wireless line WQ a M hello Q a M On look what just happened here. Oh no I don't know why that's happening here. We know but that but that the thing comes on there It's Not an associate producers not connected yet. I think it's on your end as usual WQ a M hello Oh Not there well too bad WQ a M hello Hello Neil yes, sir Hey I've got through but anyway I just want to let you know like yesterday a lot of us out there You know some of us got to work but a lot of us missed the show so I'm sitting on 10th of Neil's over here wondering what that happened I missed a hour. I mean I was listening to a 11 about 11 to 12 I took lunch When I was at lunchman I was wondering where the real heavy duty stuff came up Yeah, I know it but I can't take it anymore. You're not even re-checking you recap a little bit of what happened or Okay, I'll tell you I hang up and go to the radio. I'll recap it in 10,000 words or less Thanks, man Okay, well there's so many people that didn't listen for whatever reason from the 11 to two part of the show And what happened is that I you know came on here with the embarrassing honesty and talked about it in some of my head because we have the my space page and it was a listener Who had they used to come to the hockey games and the appearances and so on name Jacob who had the moved off to Lakeland for I don't know how long he was there and came back and was listening to the show again a big fan somebody I like a lot a lot Not a sexual friend. I don't know what you understand that not a sexual situation, but just a friend somebody I like Anyway, he got in touch with me on a my space thing and we started emailing back and forth and then he like And not him but I was the one that said a while and you know what we got to be a good friends online Which you can do that, you know not a total stranger somebody I knew a little bit And I offered to put him as one of four people in my will when I croak which there is a very substantial amount of cash in there And he disappeared I scared him off is what it tore out in boiled down to lunch for like three or four days Didn't respond to my emails my voice meals forget about it didn't pick up the phone and that was the end of that And we just tore my guts out because this is somebody I really like a lot and they know Even those your things have a full-ish old queen, but then I am maybe and And so anyway, I buried the whole story on here admitting even the thing about the will which again most people wouldn't have the But that's why the you know the number one choice on the pull is gutsy That's why when your buddy Joseph gutsy it was gutsy which is rare for me, you know right in addition Which is nobody's freaking it. It's not there for you. You do that kind of thing all the time. I do The put listen nothing more person your pants is nothing like offering to put somebody in your will That you barely even know Because you are obsessed in the like the person a lot. I don't know I might through a whole long explanation about you know how I feel about people and yada yada and it was a it was a very interesting show If you ask me it was great Far be it for me to paint myself on the back, but I'm proud that I did it and the George C. George is the one that the push me to do it And I said I was gonna write it I Maybe I know why they make myself look like some kind of a fool, you know some kind of an emotional cripple But then again who I must say has never had a period of time when we weren't in emotional cripple, right? Right, right George he's an emotional cripple all the time, but then again He's got issues, you know Well, I feel for you and just because Josh said I had to do it I wouldn't leave you like a couple of more emotional cripple. I would have blown my brains out a long time ago Now I would have gone to the balcony Tuesday and jump right off of my upper in it But it's too cold out there, man That's not cold the die It's too cold the jump This is real rock first for Shreddie of 560 You a And One two three four more bombs drop Five six seven eight more bombs drop I ain't 10 livin' to a more bomb drop we're gonna drop the bomb Around this black we're gonna drop them bombs and they go dead Loose that red right off their heads we're gonna bomb around the bottom I'm too nice we're gonna bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Out there like we're gonna bomb Right I'm not too nice, we're going to bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Out there like we're going to bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb Round the clock tonight You're fair, this is stuck to the board What a f***ing party, I'm on 116, been at 5.60, W.M.

No, the Meta, Josh? No, I haven't got a chance to listen to him I heard there's no punches pool in our net show The governor's office is reviewing, and I'm not going to be forget about this I just want to say one thing about wheels, I was just thinking about this Because I'm never really big on that whole deal But I was just thinking, you can put anybody you want in your wheel You know, if they have their permission for it, or you don't have to tell them about it Correct, correct, you're secret And then when you croak, somebody gets in touch with them And says, oh, by the way, I got news for you So I'm just like you $40 million, whatever you know, right? Surprise! Nobody leaves me a dime I'm not asking for that, because I got plenty of cash, man I'm sure we're not, I'm sure we're not cash, sure But nobody leaves me like, you would think after all these years I've heard of math, or anyone years that some old bag would have looked me like Oh, that $10 million for old meal, he gave me so much joy And not like that, would you think? You never happen Never freaking out, and not a dime So if there's any old parts out there, listen to me for a very long time And appreciate it, the free entertainment and thought I was a real hoot in the hall I'll leave me a few million, you know, or few, whatever I'll take it, and I'll share it with George and Josh And Jason, I'll just put it, I'll just, in Jacob's case, I'll just put it on I'll put money under his doorstep, you know, he'll never know where it came The Governor's Office is reviewing City Commissioner Carlton Moore's driving habits And his behavior during a recent traffic stop based spokesman said yesterday Moore was ticketed Sunday for knowingly driving on a suspended A life suspended a sentence, baby, suspended a license The activities report shows that more immediately identified himself as a city commissioner And but if they city commissioner ID card instead of a driver's license, how do you like that? Governor, FNS Governor Jim Bush's office is looking at the matter based on the initial Media reports said deputy spokesman Anthony Deloitte's, I wonder if he's related to Dom, you know, Dom Deloitte's You're fairly Bush's office is not looking at all I do love fat so man You know, I was thinking about, I was thinking about the fact that I got those emails Which now I guess is like five and two days from my close friend Jacob after he'd vanished for three days And I was thinking about that scene in fat so Would Dom Deloitte's where he, you know, he's having a fling with the, what was your name? Oh, I forgot, my whatever name was And she vanishes for a couple of days because her mother got the, definitely ill and boss into something And I had to go in the hospital and she disappeared And Sylvia, let's just say that her name was Sylvia And there's that one scene, the phone rings and Dom picks up the phone and of course it's Sylvia And he has the conversation and he's like, oh, oh, whatever And he goes to junior and he says, that was Sylvia, she wants me Remember that? Right, that is such a great movie And bad crawfish and genius man, I love and bad crawfish She was just, I would like to have had lunch with her one day, but now she's dead Would you like to have lunch with Anne Mankron? Absolutely And her husband, Mel Brooks, probably a panic Bush's office is not looking at the validity of the traffic stuff itself Deloitte said, Lydia, what? Lydia Oh Lydia, how are you doing to find that? Because you googled it, I looked her up I was like, oh man, he had more issues than I do, that's obvious, you know He had some very serious, he liked when he brought the Chinese food back Comer, at least was supposed to remember that He didn't bring several bags full of bones and whatever Bush's office is not looking at the validity of the traffic stuff itself Deloitte said, but rather it more is possible violation of law and driving for months on a suspended license Also whether he tried to get preferential treatment when he was pulled over Anytime there's information presented indicate someone may be working the law And driving on a suspended license is indeed that And we take that matter very seriously Deloitte said, well I don't know how to get you really aggravated Okay, I don't know how to get you really agitated Okay, so I was Troy, remember Troy was always asking, do I want to microwave it? Yes Because basically one of them just sits in the garage 99% of the time And you know what I'm there, I drive it around where I'm going like to I go film my prescriptions and go to the track in the bank and that's about it And of course the other one is in the possession of somebody you're not all I find of But nevertheless, this is good that many and they neither one of them has got all hardly any miles on Uh-huh I just mentioned that in passing and of course you have you know you're starting in an inkling of where I was going with that And I would never offer that you know anybody That's fine Also I have a big family to shut around a core of that to two cedar Yeah, that's right What kind of a high shot would want a beautiful core of ed to driver on a 2000 pay if he won't want it I hope to know that's why I said it's just to aggravate you Come on, I'm not making any more offers to any more people, okay? I don't buy people I don't try to like buy their kindness their friendship their whatever I'm not interested. I'd like to do nice things for people that I like that. See that's a different story Yeah, I'll see that you see the difference there. Absolutely. I mean, absolutely good 42.3% now didn't hear the show.

There was like a factory across the street. Albea is a very small town but like really in dustfield with a lot of pollution. And it was like this factory across the street in my little apartment there. And this smoke. The smoke used to just blanket the outside of the window. And you could feel it was seeping through the inside of the windows and the apartment You were like gagging on it. You know? So there's another little piece of information for you. When I was in Albea and Michigan, I was gagging on it. And it wasn't pleasant. 263 votes on a pool. Five say yesterday show is heartwarming and that warm is the cockles of my heart. Or really does.

I would think that's as we probably have a really good time together. Shouldn't on the stoop. Or maybe sit down a big boulder out there somewhere. Similar to probably find a big boulder out there somewhere in Broward. When you think, well, make it smolder. And as I get older the more I look for a big boulder. It's hard to be a Jew, a Christmas.

You don't have to deal with the peace and hope. Should have to be on your best behavior. Or give the charity. You don't have to go to grandma's house with your alcoholic family.

And in in Berlin, they have all these really neat like wide sidewalks. You know, and they're all these places where you can sit and watch the. And that's why I do a go in there and get a couple of scoops of whatever. Hagenas and sit there. I wonder if it's here. So I wonder if I'm brought up the tables and just watch all the people go by. I'm going to say people watching in Berlin is enough to make your jaw drop for your toenails. Whatever cranks your chain, baby. Berlin. I just beyond description. And of all that, you know, I've been in Stockholm and Helsinki and the places where, you know, Amsterdam a million times of Rome.

I've been there probably about 452. Well, do I have an option? What do you mean by that? Hey, maybe that's it, Josh. Maybe what I croak what I'm going to do is I'm going to have airplane tickets for you guys. So you got. Hey, how do you see? Now, do you have a passport? I don't. I could get one. I wanted to get one last year and then I realized it's like 150 bones. I was like, I want to take care of that for you. Well, I should be in a beggar. I'll call you next time when I'm in the problem. I'm just going to draw with that. And I'm talking about your plane ticket, but I sure would have covered the passport. It was such a, if you're such a schlepper, they came afford to listen. You guys, including my other good personal friend who don't have passports. I, I, I, I, I know what you're thinking about. I'm thinking about. I'm thinking about it. I'm going to have about it only 10 or 15% of all Americans have got a passport. I see, maybe you're not going anywhere right now, you know, but maybe all of a sudden the opportunity comes up. And then if you got your passport, you don't have to go through a big amount of time. You don't have to wait weeks to get in the mail or apply for an mail overnight. What if you got it? You're right. If you decide to have a passport party. I was close, but I didn't have like, I don't have an original first certificate. So that was the biggest problem. Yeah. I wasn't about to call the state of California and go through that process. Why not? Because it's the most valuable data in the US and it would have took at least a month, two months. So, so how do you like that? So when George offers to take you as to Amsterdam in a few months, which you promise I would only tell them to take it. Yeah. The part that doesn't talk. The answer. Oh, that's what you think. Oh, man. Surprise. I guess you forgot that South Park, oh, we're a little bit. 1276 votes. The show of Thursday was in my career, just heartwarming, six, still way in last place. Heartwarming. Yay. 53. You see the way I'm moving up to you? That's okay. That's okay. Whatever you say, rhymes with gay. Guess what? Bigger bulletin here. House ethics panel is trying to make an announcement at two o'clock. Only 22 minutes from now, according to Roth story. It's widely believed that the fully investigation will be released at the time. How do you like that? The Mark Foli, a Fag investigation. No. To the staff now. Miss Foli. Well, there you go. I told you she was a screamer and you didn't want to believe me. I told you Charlie Chris with another flame. Yeah. You don't want to believe that either. He's your governor now. I'm sorry. Gay governor with white hair. And a lovely complexion. But nevertheless. What do you like? Okay. That's what you want. That's right. You have another governor. Foning. Hi, I say let's make Joe governor. Your buddy Joe. Okay. He seems like a good guy. Yes, he knows you. You know, Jacob. He knows me. He's a big fan. The hard word. You know. Cindy. She and rights. Breakfast with Dennis Cassinant. I don't think I got time to read to give this. See, I don't like now. Oh, my god. It goes on and on and I don't have time work. Paul Cragman, they told you so. I have time for that. See, that's what happens when you get bogged down all the other interesting stuff which it was. Interesting. I'm using. At least, you know, little change of pace, man. Little change of pace. Change it up, baby. Throw them a change of. Throw them a freaking curve. They're just that they're reading a bunch of podcasts of the nobody cares about. They much rather hear about all your emotional breakdowns and about George's, uh, mirroredal, uh, the fugal leaves and all the other stuff. I'm not sure. I'm Josh. So, Brokey can't afford 160 bucks to apply for a freaking passport, even a homeless schlepper can do that. See, I don't understand if you were in, it was, was it the money or was it the fact that you had to go through the song and then see if the births are there. A combination of both. You know, the words either one was a good excuse to be lazy and I couldn't through and given them. Hey, man. I'm telling you, man. I'm going to get through the day. I'm going on vacation Monday. So, I'm happy about that. I didn't, uh, you see that? So, talk about an in-grade. Didn't I just make a movie right, man? This is twice, uh, this is going to get gotten turned down. I'm flattered. I know. Hey, I'll take you up on it. Okay. I'll, uh, I'll go get a passport as soon as I get my original birth certificate. Okay. Okay. Well, you let me know when that is nothing. I'll be at one of the, uh, passport application. I like that. Because I'm a generous, wonderful guy. Okay. I'm not coming down there to take you to lunch. But now needs to take you to lunch. Not that I don't like you, but it's just, you know. Remember I don't want me to go to lunch, George? Yeah, that's right. If anybody wants to know that I don't want to take the lunch, probably need to be a three-vote son of a pool. We got 13 every week, man. If there's nothing that makes it hit me happy. I know when I got it, look. Hi. This is Jim. Love you. Show me. Love you. Love you. Danny, the drunk and actor is a little short ball guy. Who stayed up fast. He's bedtime. Cause he led George Clooney by. He had some little munchellos. Codants of a healthy boss. He went to be on the view. Where he thought it was cool too, cause. They knew Danny was really smart. When David was saying, Rosie, you are such a delight. Won't give me my date tonight. Now we're all laughing at him. Like British like all panties. Danny's a fangest actor. But another crush of lab ratty. 144 16. 202. 204. We got that 1300. Big baby. No. 5. 6. 7. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 6. 5. 5. 6. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. East. 9. 5. 8. 5. I thought it was very touching. But it turns out that you know, somewhat about overs affecting your mates. If you been to cross so badass me, watch my video. Listen to me please until I'm free to post this episode. I'm a takeover , so you can watch KKKKk. Okay, but you ain't getting any. I'm sorry. Why don't I give away as much as I can now? Like I'm not doing that? Like I don't support the whole universe? What is she talking about? Well, she thinks she's talking to you anyway. Guess what, honey. George ain't got any money to give away and I'll give it to whoever I want to. I'll leave you like debt when I die. That was cute. At any rate. Yeah, I'm just going to give it all away right now. I'm going to win by and right now. I'm going to do it. Listen, listen. I'm going to stay there until I have nothing left. Not that I can access my entire report for you. But I'll find a way. And I'll somebody's going to wreck that if you keep talking like that. You are George. Relentless and hostile. It's an amazing to me. Amazing to me. See, if the audience should know this, one of my closed personal friends who lives down there, George hates like poison because it's the one who said that he thinks George talks behind my back. He said that long time ago. He said, I'm going to do something. And you have never forgotten that. That's just what I don't think somebody's been overprotective and not me. Yeah, overprotective. Making stuff up. I believe it. I agree with it. Doesn't matter. Why would he say something like that? I've never seen him come back. He's just who knows. Because he doesn't bastard that's why. He doesn't like you, maybe. He's just because he's a lot of, well, whatever. The feeling is mutual now. I'm sorry. I stuck up for him all the time. I'm sorry. I actually did that. But it's just my strange sense of humor. You know me. So I'm going to just, in fact, I'll say to what, everybody line up. I'm going to be at it in a couple of hours and I'll just start giving money away. How's that? I'm going to take a tin. I'll talk about Rockefeller with the old man. John D. Rockefeller used to do that. He used to hand out dimes on speedclaw. Sure. Bring a tin cup or a hat or a tambourine. There you go. I'll be right over there by the sub center. Right across the street on the corner of 441. I was very rude. I'll be right there when fun. I'll chuck sub center with my little tin cup. I know you guys would be out there. But if I just like those homeless voice people, Sean Koonie and that crowd. Yeah. I'll break a bucket. Just everybody line up on the corner outside of the station with an orange t-shirt on and with a tin cup and a big tin gallon head and I'll throw a whole bunch of change in there. Okay? You can spend the rest of the week in feeding the change. W2QAM. Hello. W2QAM. Hello. Hello. Nila, you doing? Okay, sir. Yeah, listen. I haven't, if you can maybe do me a favor. I'm feeling a little bit depressed kind of under the bed. Would you press the button? What? What do you need press the button? Well, I have a bad cold in my, I'm sorry. Three years of my wife. I was just telling my wife the other day that she gets sick all the time. And now look what happens to me. She's got punishing you, man. That's the popcorn and kettle pink. Exactly. But if you can do me a favor now. That's what I mean. I'm not a bus and Delray. I haven't heard that. Sit down. I'm a bus. I'm a man. I'm a bunch and Delray. Thanks for bad roi's, man. I'm sorry. Okay. We'll do better. I'm set up on the radio fan. I'll write a good note. I'm not just why. I'm the poison saying. My wife just decarded a phone. She drives my view and gets you sweet pink phone. I wouldn't write what's on your way. I said I'd do the ladies again. So I'm just sitting on a pension Delray. Waiting for your family price to take me away. Oh, just sit on a pension Delray with my friend Hain. Oh, my wife is tied to a cow and jay. First of all, I say, don't wait to stay the same. All that good of doing with heaven tells me to do. The time in her legs she must be in pain. Just give me the best in my bones. When we win, why my wife won't leave me alone. We've got to over and I never win. I just wind up slacking through the wall again. I'm so sick of a pension Delray. Waiting for your family price to take me away. Oh, just sit on a pension Delray with my friend Hain. There it is. It's about time that you wait for your family's price. And I'm just going to stop the pension Delray. Once it's the, there you go. It's all requested holidays between none of the year. That's a good idea. It kills some great time and here are the same 10 bits. All young, the young, the bridge tender. Over and over. What are you saying? All right. And then the endless loop, of course, my favorite. Yeah, like that. It's a beautiful thing. Anyway, just to show you, this whole thing about the will and everything. Because you're so skeptical and so cynical about people. Especially people I like. I am. And the first email message you got from my good friend Jacob today. It's said, I'm not going to read the whole thing. It says, you know, sorry to have started this. But it seems to have made a great show for you. One of the best. Yeah. I think it was great to show him. Of course, because I was talking about him. It says, I did catch him, Schmidt from some of my friends, but nothing they, they loved it. They all believed that I'm stupid. But I know I'm doing the right thing. See, I didn't like that. Otherwise he doesn't want my end. And not looking for my generosity. Not looking to take advantage of my foolishness in my old emotional gainess. And whatever it is, he's a good guy. He's a good guy. And if your buddy, Joe, see, he's, he's, he's a good guy. And if he's Joe, totally there. Why? Because he said he's a good guy. And he used to sit in a smoke a big family together and went out. So he fought for his wife. That's why. That's why. Like, because he's got that big family for you right now. You can make up some excuse. Sure. Yeah. But with you, there's always got to be some reason. Right. It's the season for some kind of silly reason. From 99. Oh, my God. This last couple of days has made up for another wise extremely debilitating week. The billitating. No, what that means? No, me. Tell me. I'm just killing a time while I'm refreshing it again. Oh, I see. It flips over to 1300. There's a lot of suspense in it and it doesn't do in it. They do that to me all the time. It's almost like they're working in concert. In concert at the macarina, the new Rogers audience, playing with his emotions. And that's because they don't want to emotional cripple anyway. A wreck. But it's still 12. What do you got on your thing there? How many you got? Loading 12.29. Oh, man. I keep. This thing has been zooming up there and now I want that 1300 votes so badly. I can almost taste it. Something anyway. And still I'm refreshing and refreshing and refreshing and it's not doing anything. Not still 12.99 no matter what we do. I think maybe Eric has played with me now. He probably shut it down. He probably jambed that baby right off. Oh, there it is. 13. Oh, that was. That was an amazing exercise there, you know? That was very hard to do with something. I don't have a relapse. Maybe I need some vintage juries. I'm going to be very honest with you. You know what a big vintage juries fan I am. But they've come up with some new flavors. The last couple of years that really suck, you know? I haven't noticed. Crap. What about you? You don't eat any? I tried that too. I mean, you know, you're, you know how I am with ice cream and the like that. And so I'll see you. I'll be in my supermarket without having any intention to buying that. But then I'll see something like a new flavor on their all-boy-f. And you read the label that sounds really great because they are very descriptive in where they describe all the crap that's in it. And you're bringing it home and new kid. And it's like, yeah, this isn't very good. What's the biggest tennis with this, you know? What's the big deal with this crap? Disappointing. I really believe fish food was the end of the line for them. That was the end. And I don't see that anywhere. And you know what? That's really good too because just like the dual CD LH through a bag. So, it's certainly snowflared... ...whatever. ... nickname于ド经 chant. It's definitelysqueal. All right, I got off the thing on Hogan Does. Talking about Berlin, again I have a lot of very fine memories of Berlin. Believe me. I want to in particular but many, many many many. It's just a great place. Fantastic city and they have Hogan Doe's. Isn't that reason to get your pants for it? Yeah. Oh yeah. If it's on okay. And we'll all pick out on Hogan Doe's. Dip that girdings. And once again. In your lips, and onto the rear wheel if the wheel won't tick off. More to your home, you need your arm.وく。 It's dangerous!
