I sure never heard of it. You never heard of the Ederson Park Arena. I forgot to mention it. No. You weren't in Rochester, we were at Lester Harrison. Oh, Lester Harrison. Oh, I thought you were talking about Detroit. No, I'm talking about Rochester. Yeah, I saw games at, you know, Lester Harrison was the world's coach and Red R-Bock was the Solis coach. Yeah. Just scream and hollering carry on. Bobby Wanzer, Bob Davies, Arnie Ryzen, now we're talking. Great. Well, the Dick Stockton wanted me to pass that along to you that he was there in those days.

You that, uh, very still. I don't care how much he kisses my S. He sucks. He wanted me to bring these things in your hair. Pull him on. What are called it? You know, something that one and the Dave and Borg's call of the Marlins winning the series. They'll have to be two of the most pathetic critical calls. World series or playoff ending calls in the previous course. Anyway, what? That's it. Yeah, some other stuff, too. We'll talk about that. Yeah. Like one never mind. Please. Come on. Let's go. Don't hold back. I'm not going to say, you want to go to the computer. Because I don't want to see. I'm not like Larry King. In other words, this guy's somebody kisses my S. I'm not going to kiss you kissy back. Especially when they look like they've stopped. And you know what I'm saying? Well, he just happens to enjoy you. That's good. So this is great mouse for release. Brace got a sense of humor. One may be dickas too. Yeah. He does. He does. Oh, good. They doesn't mind the fact that I rip my name. He knows you rip him. I'm just kidding. Not. He's not. He never stole a free turn. You know, there are some people you rip who get it. Yeah. What does that mean? I'm hoping he doesn't get it. They, you know, they were like there are some people who you. You know, rip me like a text. I see he, you chatted him off. He says, and they hear a new chatted him off. I, and he's really yesterday. Yeah. I hope they make, make, make truck. I got it. I got it. This is, I have a copy of this email. Where, where, where do you listen to me? Yeah. I have a copy of an email in my hand right now. That's going to answer a lot of questions. Yeah. Even though our station of, you know, much of losses. But that's, that's their problem. I've washed my hands of you. And I did my best. This is an email from Alan Brown. You know who that is? Yeah, I do. The Vice President of Communications for his part, Sports Talk 7. What are the great qualities in the world? Well, I, as a matter of fact, if you like to email him, tell him what a phony he is and about how we're on his phony up. Full there, you can email him a brown at 790 the ticket dot com. All one word, a brown at 790 the ticket dot com. Here is his email. Wait, tiggy, hear all the people that's written to you from a man to Lipman Howard Davis, not Howard David. John Stugas, we are Scott Betscher. Is it? Becker Betscher. Backstee Grantsik. Genopolito Brian Fierreberg, Michael Smith, Jim Favola, John Travolta, Theresa Griffin, Terry Griffin, Victor Aguerea, Chrisine Aguelera, Alison Turner, Jason Salotkin, Zach Krantz, Jonathan Zazlo, Brandon Guzio, Richard E. Gagey Mark Hockman, Hawkman, Isch, Shane Chinick, Richard O'Badwaya. I hope the Beast understands it when you get a spin on that that the computer or you or you know, you know this, don't you? Yeah. When you get to spin the computer or we decide to what you're going to get, it's just a dog and pony show you. You do know that. No, it's all luck. No, no, that's absolutely untrue. It's all luck. My finger decides it all. Okay, whatever you say. You got to lucky fingers because I know where you're stored. Backstum. Richard E. Kurt Murphy, Kevin Rogers, Lindsey Dean, Lindsey Nelson, Dizzy Dean, Shane James Jackson. It's everybody who worked in that lore. Listen to me, Natalie Blind, Adrian based, Jeremy Peltz, Lindsey Dean again, Phil Shane, Mark Eisenberg, by Mayor Busley Shane and every, and like 8,000 names on here and here's what it says. Greg Cody is doing a web pool on radio, Worse in South Florida. He's looking for your favorite least favorite host. Please vote and let's crush the QAM. Here's the link. And there's the link. Blogs.Herald.com, above. And it's signed Alan T Brown, Vice President of Communication Sports Thought 790, the ticket with his phone number and his a Brown at the 790, the ticket.com. It's the top of this instance. I came upon this email photo of my new news sign to friend. So maybe somebody on the inside over there walked across the street or who knows, you know, or tipped off somebody inside and they made a copy of it. So obviously they were like Daisy Chaining, Susan and so, Susan is about 100 names on here, at least 30 or 40 anyway. And if each of them said about to like, you know, you see what I'm saying is Daisy Chaining. He's a liar and a fake. So it's obvious that Alan Brown, they felt that this was extremely important. So maybe it's a good thing that our people didn't get involved, because they're being messed up a couple hundred votes. Let them take some comfort and ask, you know, because they said the whole thing is so, the whole thing's a fraud. Yeah, but just guys are fraud. People wouldn't have watched that, man. We got such a bunch of, I don't know. I just, I like I said, I give up. I just throw in the towel. I do my thing tend to tune at you. I talk to you in the morning, which is fine. That's it. Two o'clock. It's like, remember the song by Roger Williams and Jane Morgan, a hundred years ago on Capricot's called Two Different Worlds. Remember that song? Yeah. Yeah. That's it. We got two different worlds on this station. There's me and you guys. Well, I was Alan Brown's a guy who sent out a press release to the writers. Nice job, Brownie. When the president of the Marlins was on, they were after noon show. You know, he asked if it was true that I had a, that they had a higher rating, and I did, and they said, yes. And then he said that nobody ever listens to me. You're sort of like that. Really? Yeah. And so Alan Brown sent out the release. Well, nobody printed it because everybody knew it was BS. You know, Alan Brown is just a scum. How can you lie about the ratings? And that's back in the day when you were a guy who's a liar in a phone. You lie in a phone, Alan. And he said, Chief, shout artists in your website. And you're a email address is a Brown. It's seven ninety the ticket. I kind of want one clip. I wouldn't miss it. Yeah. And he's an email there with, you know, complaints about we know that. I know that. I know people in my head are a consultant. Yeah. Oh, it's been a while. Can I tell you a funny story? Remember Walter's Sabo? Yeah. A real A-hole. He was a passion consultant, Friday, for a while. In fact, he hired Karen K, who is his a lady friend. And the first night on the air, she was bragging about the fact that she was a bang in the a consultant. But anyway. And that's a true story. Yeah. So any how, Walter Sabo, who's a backstabber and a real A-hole, he coesies up to the town. Many goes back to the management, you know, like rats us all out and the stabs us in the back. He kills rearwings. He calls him to have a heart attack. Because he screwed him over at WRK one Boston. But anyway. So Walter Sabo calls Norma Kintke a few days ago. Happens to know the guy to own CFRB in Toronto. Well CFRB, which is 1010 on the dial same as I and S. and the year, CFRB 50,000 lots of very prestigious station here for years and years. And now it's the talk station. And the owner who just, you know, he owns this is one station. He's a huge fan of mine. He's got a place down there and where the hell they say somewhere down there in South Florida. Winter home. And he would love to have me on the air sometime on CFRB for fun. No, it's not to pay me. But just to come on just for fun. Isn't that great? Yeah. Yeah. Now let me just take it this because we already have CFC and Joyce. We got both of them around our neck. But the sentence you're excited. The FCC we know how aggressive they are. The CTRC, which is the equivalent candidate of the FCC, they make the FCC look like George Carlin. Okay. That's how re-uptight and repressive they are. Even though CBC will very often use the F-word or SH-word in their news. This is like a new story or what a no problem or a movie. But as far as talk show as man, if I said crap the first time that would come in and bodily drag me out of the studio. So the idea that I'd be on here here is the chances are, and especially for fun. Yeah. We all really are spotty. I'm not doing it for fun. Just give me the money please. No, it's not fun. Especially when you're working for this outfit. But Clarice, you know, Carlin is getting a lot of bottom here. They in fact before he goes off he's going to get himself a nice blueberry animal. He's doing that right now. I could do it with those. Clean out his brains. Yeah. I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you right now. Who are you? How did they get you? I was just standing in front of him. Hey, Dick, how are you doing? Maybe he's going to get you a- How's that how chicken he's married to? He's married to? He's a little bit nicer. Lessley, viscer, there you go. Lessley, viscer, right? I was going to. Well, thank you. That's nice. For 52 years old, that's a compliment. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. You can't out of here. Oh my god, you're all enough to me. My grand par. Man, I got to tell the old. A year ago, I'm walking along my complex. I walk. You sound like a Jewish, you know? Well, yeah. Go ahead. Okay. So Neil, I'm walking along. I know I was on the radio up Friday, which you knew. He had a couple of comments about me. And all these cars are stopping as I'm walking in there saying, So here would Neil just said about you. Really? I said of what's the need to it. And then another car. Neil just ripped you when you walked by. So while you were walking along, as long as they keep talking about your man. You know, that's the thing that's a little bit of a mess. I've been telling you, hi, guys. You know, I'm down and bulk. Listen to you guys. Well, I was asking. When you were in bulk, did you have to go with him? No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Come on. You don't have to hold back. He's on here anymore. You have to hold back. I have to hold back. I have to hold back. I have to hold back. I have to hold back. I have to hold back. Yeah. And then you swap here. He's there. I'm wearing hair. I don't wear hair. You know what? You're not allowed to attack you. You know, you're talking to the guy who embarrassed him. I know. And he's trained him out of that dead musk, right? I didn't let him do a lab. You know it's a truth. You know it's a truth. We love it. We love it. Lossies, as you listen to when you have the oil and you listen to it, we have a great time. So I really appreciate it. Thanks to walk. Well, congratulations on the good night's young wife. Well, that's a good news. You've done a great job. I'm like, yes. Especially for a guy as bland as you are, man. I have a hot wife. Oh, I know. I know. We want to tell him. You must have something with a little bit. I'll tell you that. Well, you don't want people talking to watch on TV. Great. That's for sure. Okay. Listen, uh, whatever your name is, a dick. I have a great life. Yeah, great. I am. I am possible. You're a big con of Super Bowl. It's called the Super Bowl. Who's calling it? Yeah. Well, uh, how Mike is on Madden, they can see. I'm a man they're doing it. Yeah. The dick is doing the uh, international broadcast. Oh, in other words, in a foreign language. We do we speak in tongues. Yeah. That's what I've got. I've got a little bit of bilingual deal. We speak out of both sides. Yeah. That's what I heard by is the opportunity for both of us. Yeah. Yeah. How do you're golfing buddy there? Okay. I know. Thank you. You have to get the tattoo right now. Yeah. That's maybe. See you, Pally. Okay. You know, special man. It was good. Put me in the age of like this. Yeah. Anyway, Alan Brown, but then again, heck of a brawl browning. That's, that's why you got a pack to that guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I better not. I wouldn't mind that. No, go ahead. Yeah. A friend of mine hired him as a consultant and he promised them all kinds of things. He was going to do for him and he got paid and apparently none of the things materialized. So well, he sure whipped up about that. He's not having a blind date. He's all a full minute to mouth and he's got them a couple hundred votes ahead. And they're like circulating this email and they got the Daisy chain going. Probably outstanding of each one of these people under with a whip, making him like a hop under computers. Well, that's what I stole Cody. I said, yeah, I just walked up to I didn't know you think it's odd that like 900 votes came in and two hours for one station. And he said he's trying to tell me that that it's, the system is full proof again. Yeah, right. Oh, give me a break. Yeah. You can vote on there like every two minutes of you. Who that was. Artisan. And additional, which in, and he looks at you with a straight face, even though he's on their payroll a bit there. And then when his buddy will pass through this, the scene sports fairery every afternoon, was he kidding? Who was he kidding? Jesus Christ, Cody, you're out of get him in there. Then they're going to call for us. I'm going to get him in there tomorrow morning. I'll put him on the ear. I'll see if I can find him. But kiss your man. I talk about this. He is the epitome of what the hero's all about. Bush League isn't even the word for it. I wouldn't wipe my ass with a hero. Especially with his page. Especially with his face on it. Oh, no, in fact, now that I think of it, I take that back. You would. Yeah, I would. It definitely would. Well, you have a nice day. I absolutely will. In fact, I'm going to go get some of that. What's that? Senacot. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I guess that. I get that. The pages got Greg Cody's picture on it. I'm going to do a real number on it. Maybe he'll, maybe when you see him next time, he'll have a stranger Roma about it. Although he probably already does. Well, I would like to talk to this doctor. This morning, sure. He's always no Alan Brown. Yeah, that's for sure. But I really got you going. Just to mention that. Yes. I'm going to read this email. In fact, I got to read it. You want to read it again. A Brown at 790TheTicket.com. You want to have beast email in your regards from Detroit from the Super Bowl. Yeah. Type an S in speak. You know what? And have a couple of heroes on the way to nice, nice long journey through midtown. Yeah. That's a good idea. And beast can take a walk and on 12th street late at night. Yeah. I'll give you all the right neighborhoods, man. Have a good day. I know my Detroit. I will talk to you tomorrow. I will talk to you tomorrow. I'll get off to a Northville down tonight where you've been there once before. It's not too late to go again. Okay. Red. Red. Just remember. Red, Cramer, every race. Crunch. You're welcome. You're welcome. All right. Hi. This is Red. Hi. I like to both these shoes inside the shower store. Six times. And I go sweet shit with. And snack there off the wall. I'll make you the normal. I do hate it that day. But I must be small by penny's hand. On the way. Why do you want to go away? When they throw shower, scum, flat way. I like to go to shower. I like to sweat, sweat, sweat, and spray. Take it to go to shower. I like to go to shower. I like to go to shower. Why do you want to go to shower? I like to put my light in the toilet plenty of paint on the road like this. But I think thislie is very cute. I like to take photos of where they go for theVotein room. If you didn't hear this, you could stay home. Right here. Right here. Right here. Oh, you. That's just enough to make me cry, you know? Yeah. Well, he did a fine job as usual. Checking that. That's great. Got a little carried away in one of the other ones, but that's beside the point. Oh, if you mention that to Clare, it said he's got no clue. But I guess he already knows that. Oh, I'll have him do it over. See, it's one thing. What? Oh, yeah, the ugly, a two one. I want. Because he says small, can't say that no more. Or less. Oh, there's John Bolton with that. I'm not sure it's must-as. Take a few could that. Oh, you got it. You know, it's how more and more these are new guys. They got the mustache. Yeah. And if he could put a little like a shoe polish on it, that Reagan left over. He can look this like Hitler. Oh, yeah. Anyway, Alan Brown writes, I'll get to that in a minute. I'm going to read that. How many times did I have to do it? It is so amusing. What is his email again? A Brown at 790TheTicket.com. I don't want to just let him know that we're on to him. And it is Daisy Chain and how desperate. Oh, yeah. Let's get the army. We had, we're trying to have some fun with it. And just bury them, which would have been appropriate. And arrest of the station. Yeah. Yeah. We got important things to talk about like, Jack. And I saw the hell with it. I, you know, I gave him an 800 vote lead. They just dropped it right in the reddit. They said, right, vote camp where set his fat ass right down on the ground and refuse to move. And as that's fine, you know, it's hard to move when you're that big. If I talk about personality transplant. This is Neil Rogers. This is 560A. Neil got it. The bottom is an apology. From the headquarters of this reading, the prison. 660A. Yes, it's been brought to our attention from outside sources. Since we never listened to radio anyway. That the only lucrative show we have on the air, the new Rogers show, I believe it is, has been played in parts again. Now, this flies in the face of God and the FCC. Oh, they're not really the FCC. But we know so little of broadcasting. We don't want to take any chances. Subsequently, this validates our fear of indicating you'll show on our other stations. Not that it ever would have occurred to us in the first place. We are much too busy convincing ourselves that we know what we're doing. After all, we are based in prestigious Ford Myers, a town that Oscar named after his we need. Suffice it to say if you want to feel important, when office space above a seashell score in Fort Myers, and get more cousin policy than that. Or not to mention, as a Florida based business, we benefit by not having to pay our bill or employees. So, I still like good joy. Thank you. Thank you. I love the dog. Oh, man. I think somebody just got joy. Oh, anyway, 22. But 10 over there, there's a crazy angry Yeats has been released. She's walking out. She's got a little brown sack that she burred from Barry Jackass. And she's Wilson right out there. Honey, like that. What's that all about? Let's go to the funny fun. Will we get there properly? Will we tell where she's going? Or are you joking? No, no, that's she's going too. Oh, thank goodness. Because it says Yeats released. So I thought maybe like out of the real world. No, she's being committed. I see. Well, here's somebody who probably ought to be on line nine. Q.A.M. Hello. A.Neal. Yes, sir. What's going on with your signal? Ben. It's like fading in and out. You know, so what else do you want to do? Where are you? Like in Jacksonville? No, I'm in the for effect. I'm straight at the Fort London International. Uh, for far away. Too far away. But coming. Hey, listen. We got to conserve man. That's a new beastly deal. That's a new strategy. That's why we're eliminating 400 jobs. We've got 100 people working there. We're eliminating 400 jobs. I will say we're off the air for a second. There in the beginning. Yeah. So I might be with you guys talking about maybe what we came back on. We're like using that backup transmitter to one of the guy climbed up on. I'll be behind the hero. That's that. I find out that's the backup tower. That's a transmitter. What's the backup tower? Did you know that? Yeah. Maybe the guys back up on it. Anyway, I changed my mind. I think it's only 200. And I just looked at that thing because, uh, Hank, uh, and between the Ellen Brown thing, and just crossed my ass as email. Only 280 votes behind. I don't care about the individuals because those guys don't care enough about it to plug for themselves. So why should I care? But the thing where it says, which is the big two-state new prefer for sports radio. Uh, and of course Greg insists Greg Coatex that he got those, uh, safety valves in there so you can't vote twice. But wouldn't it be something you'll only, 1893 people of Otopree, QM just I'll try to vote again when I'd like right now. I'm doing it. I mean, I know it couldn't possibly work, but nevertheless. So on the Miami Hill website of front page, okay, you go about two-thirds of the way down on the right hand side. So there it says, it says, Greg Coatex, uh, random evidence blog. And then you go all the way to the bottom of the thing, which is the big two-station new prefer for sports radio, and you vote for QM or for, uh, hey, you know, we could do a test. I'm bigger part. We could do a test. You could view it while I vote and see if it changes. No, okay. Because that, but how might I know if it's you? Well, it'll be something. That's your, that's a good point. Because if you're the only one I can get to vote again, I'm not, that doesn't say much about the power of the whole guy. The total is 2178 for 790, the ticket. And 1893 for QM. All right, I just voted for Hank. No, I'm not talking about that. I don't care. That's fine. I'm happy about that. I'm not looking at that. Which of the big two-station new prefer for sports radio? We don't have time to prosecute your mom with those individual, who do you hate, who do you, the best, the worst, the most mediocre, the most fondest, the fastest. No, we're looking at, you know, what does you prefer? I just said on QM. Yeah, I am. What does it say? What's the total now? 1899 to 2198. Well, that's not good. I mean, we just got six, they got 20. That means that Eisenberg and Lorber and Kevin Rogers and Kurt Murphy and Mark Hockman and Richard E.G. and Zach Cranson, Jonathan Zazlo and Brian Fierberg and Stugos Wiener and his daddy and mommy and the dog and Scott Petsch. They're all vote like a hand-over-releam press. This is good. But let's have it all out battle tonight. Let's just kick their disgusting ass. Why? I think you can vote multiple times. I'm clicking multi-hand. I am telling you, you can vote as often as you want. Listen, you believe Greg Co. takes it to Harold. He's a easy idea, but he wouldn't know the internet's malgores ass. Who you kidding? Somebody QM internet central, hello. Here's my deal. This panel hasn't until 1020. I thought about one of you show you've been on and off the air. Thanks for the bad news. How do you like that? See, we're trying to like, this is great. This is great. This terrorist has been in there to say you guys have been off the year a whole bunch. Miguel told me, yeah. What about our program director? What about junior program director? What tells he do? He says he's getting a blueberry animal today. And we can't get to two. I could really use a blueberry animal today. Yeah. Not from what I'm hearing. No, to not be sure about anything in the middle. Nobody can copy of the day. Nobody brought a lighter. Don't cut down on the azu car, baby. Like I see that quiz with say, azu car, I just cut it down. And cut her down too. I've got a pretty fancy lighter. Like an oak tree. Careful. So, and that's it. If we're not on the year, I'm not going to sit and spend a lot of energy. Then wonder how come I can't get any response. This is so, typically, a two way in man. No, we're straightened out now though. And you're straighting out. I'm gonna download, don't let go of here. WQAM. Hello. Yeah, new. Yes, sir. Yeah, you're signal has been cut in an house and you started to show even like they're in a commercial. Right. Hey, can I give you a website to check out? What is it? I'm going to get a worm from or something? No, no, no. It's a worm now. They got a new worm making the rounds. It's 911truth.org. Well, yeah, somebody already gave that to me. Let me write it down because I keep, I write these down and I lose whatever I wrote it on. I've got some bad news for you for Michigan. Yeah. Ted Nougand running for governor. Well, good luck to all of us. Okay. Thank God. I'm not in Kalamazoon or more in San Fiel. Okay. See you in a salani pal. So Alan Brown writes. Yeah. Oh, God. I love it. So in other words, we haven't been on the air. We're still getting in a few votes on here. Everybody's better vote again. I'm at, uh, which station? All we're at that 1921 already. Yeah. I voted like 10 times already. Yeah, but they saw her there. People. This is good man. It's like Ricky Martin would love this. It's like a pain contest. He'd probably love to get right in the middle in between the two stations. 1027 a 2 AM. This is the real Rogers. This is 5162. If you're a matted big star who's known for crashing cars and snorting stuff up a year. No, y'all. You got a needing disk order and you're punched a reef porter and there's a picture of a reef with no clothes, looks. Well, you want to find a cap. Saying your last movie clocked in, why did you tell her your hair? Before the popper, I just didn't use got to get your picture on the cover of the vanities there. Vanities, they gonna get your picture on the cover. They're waving on your stage, mother. You'll pay. Go to the beach. Some damage control on the cover of the vanities. You're going to pay. You're going to pay. You're going to pay. You're going to pay. You're going to pay. You're going to pay. You're going to pay. I don't believe it. Look at that girl. She's a movie named beauty who's appeared in movies and you see her in a picture show. Yeah, I saw ghosts. Who's his or her? He's a little baby that she brings to this studio. She makes all talent don't have all talent calls. The clothes she does on the way. The clothes that are painted on the girls. They give on the cover of the vanities there. Vanities, they gonna get your picture on the cover of the vanities. They're going to show the parade. And on the cover of the vanities. I'm going to tell the red. Very very good thing. So I'm going to tell the girl. Take a ride. I'm going to tell the great presentation course in tight session because she's gone out all the way. I'm going to tell the body by sure who he is. And the evening, the trip, the city, the city, the things, the staff, the family, the girls, the way them can actually look at so damn odd name or something. And she makes the sun and the sun to get the sun. And the color of the vanities. Welcome. Vanities. I'm going to tell the red. I'm going to tell the red. I'm going to tell the red. I'm going to tell the red. All the colors of the vanities. I'm going to tell the red. I'm going to tell the red. I'm going to tell the red. I'm going to tell the red. I'm going to tell the red. It's a beautiful smile and shape and pregnant this time. Who would have ever dreamed back when that first came out when we played that about 85 years ago that you would be doing an Ask and Kouchi Kou, now. That would really give it a thought, though. Anyway, so we just got an email from one of our insiders over there across the street. And the reason we're not. We're only getting three net votes. If we don't have both totals or zooming up there. Yeah. Because Alan Brown has got everybody even a janitor across the street. And they're all sitting in their PCs and other people's PCs and their PCs. And it like tap it out every time we get one, you get like two. And then they get two and we get three. And then they're banging up up up over and over again. Because this is obviously extraordinarily important to them. I never realized that. So I don't want to pee on their parade, but nevertheless let's do it anyway. That's your assignment. Today folks, it'll keep you off the street. It doesn't make quite a lot of effort on your part. And our poll is kind of like crappy anyway. I'm not crazy about our poll. Thanks anyway, Sean. I see I don't understand. He puts and rounds your me on there, which has got a bunch of votes. About who has the least self respect? Yeah. It would seem to me it's just the opposite. He might think, well, we know he thinks he's hot stuff. And of course he's a grotesque and gigantic and hairy and nauseating. Of course the fact he's lucky to be double-jointed, that's just a free nature. It might be a lack of self respect for somebody good looking to do something like that. But in his case, it's, you know, he's, that's great work. Yeah. What an ego. A massive, a pup again, a massive ego and a massive well. 1957, we got a megad 220, 223, that's what they got. He's looking at, and he is a, I'm not going to give you a facts that says that it doesn't count, but it looks to have be having an effect. Well, somebody quits it down. We just got a pup. He'll go in, just went to 58. Right. Look at it again. Look at it again. Wait. All right, click it again. 59. Oh my god. All right, brother over there. He's got to be doing like, what can Brown do for you? You know what I'm saying? You got to be changing his underwear, be two minutes. Is it, as if you know what I'm saying? What he said? What I'm saying is that maybe Eddie will, since Eddie was the only, I stopped, yesterday, during the show, I stopped looking at that, that comment, well, I mean, it's giving me a break. The same three misfits, the same nickel midsets that are on every chat room, every comment line, every, oh, brother. Wow. But maybe Eddie might want to email Alan Brown, Tom, but a great job he's doing over cross-to-street. Yeah. Yeah. Babu, Babu. Swam can get a really good idea of our intellectual. Let's see. Here's what I said. You cannot vote twice on the Cody Poll. If you know this half of you vote in the box of the results, on the bottom, where it says, how many people vote in the poll also says, who you voted for in a what time? I do see that. If you want to vote twice, you have to clear your cookies. In internet sport, just press tools and internet options, then they leave cookies and you start over again. By the way, it says, I'm listening online, so I can hear your fine. Well, thank God for that. We had a lot of people in town, was not like we were single blows. And of course, they're single over there. Oh, even when I was going to end WS, you know what's on S790? You think we got a few when interference, but I'll cranked up by some 80 million, no, what signal on the 790? Right there. And so at night, I mean, you could be sitting under the tower. It's like the light bulb in Fort Lauderdale. You can be sitting under the transmitter. And you still can't hear the damn thing. Call it a signal. How could I job Allen? Brownie? 1959, 2014. You can just keep refreshing that man. That's a good part of it. Don't you like that? Yeah. I'm fresh from Ohio. 1967 at 33, 277, we picked up eight votes. Oh, Nick. Because Allen is like standing over there, shoulders, especially he's two gods. You know, if you're going to get all that, he's money's two. John, we know man. Then you better like keep tapping that baby out. Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Farabit, Because you know, there's sure it's all not getting in from what they got on the right now. That's for damn sure. WDQAM, hello. New God. Yes sir, speaking happy Thursday, sir. Happy Thursday to you. Hey, the big E just played about the beans, listen. Yeah. Beats money is bang out for it, and sometimes I'm almost there. I'm just about what my pants are. Yeah. That was terrific. Yeah. Keep it up and have an awesome day, young man. Back to you, pal. Yeah, things are looking up now. Okay, the boss is away. He's getting doctor to something. Then we got the clearance in again, this blueberry animal. And then Alan Brown, he's going to like a lobotomy or something. Boy, you call him or consultant like that thing says. Hey, that's a good poll. Who's the better consultant? Water Sabo. Alan Brown or Greg Reed. Oh, yeah. Wow. By the way, chicken neck says that he did not say that word. Oh, he didn't say it. I haven't heard it. So I was going to listen to it. Okay. Well, let's listen to it then. I was positive he said penis. I mean, we didn't say that, but just like, I still don't know what. I'm sorry. Why? I was saying it. I also bought plenty of the TV just though. Oh. I don't understand. What's the problem with that? There isn't one to kept that joys made it up. No, no, no. No, a joys didn't make it up. It just had a couple of weak needle level management people said, oh, a cheap joys can say, hey, hey, hey, no matter what they ask. No. That's all. She's not on re-annoy instead. Yeah. That's what she just plays to recording. Buffalo Bill going. Yeah. That's all. Can we say it? There is that you bastard. Yeah. Friday is an exception. We can say it's Friday you bastard. That's the one day we should let us say that. Why does that say that she goes for her poison, very animal? Okay. Let's listen to it. I'll see what you think. I can't eat that over here. Fuck around there. I'm a dead man. He's you. I'm a bear. I go. I go. I go away. I go to the door. Hey, hey, hey, hey. That was me. How the fuck did you get this? That was the first time I got this. See how you doing there and fuck them all? It's in the father's daughter's seat. You told them to get time slots. No, I'm going to change the face of western conscious for whole radio. Start noise and interview with a generic spongebob. Then yeah. That don't like the fire under the air sense of pain. I don't matter who this is because now I'll sound alike. I'm going to find a light. Roll it down. Two of us are saved. I'm just excited to introduce you with me. Oh, make a hundred percent effort to perform well. Say yes. Archimals, you sports guys are like that. So happy with him. Stupid. Well, we have to go to college. But never really attend classes. Just like, not too smart, is the situation we have. You're doing great when about male athletes and whysitting and jackscats is a little little. I have a day. And just a little on the jury aside. Maybe stretch it out at the scene if you type. But some is what it is. We like women. We are programmed to do so. You're a disdainer. I'm excited one show. You're whether he and he went talk about girls. It is a little weird. He's very small things. He's very small things. You say you're not a sport. He's a sport. I'll be dead. He didn't come close to seeing you. How come you told me he did? You know, I'm a jerk. I know. Remember that song by Glam Campbell, Jens, I'm on my mind. That's right. So we know what was on your mind. Okay. Listen. You know, it's much important to think about this memo. Oh, Jesus. The Humphre would have like, he may be not him so much. Because he was an involvement because he's out of town out of touch. The memo from Alan Brown to everybody across the street to get all feverish about his stupid ass blog with Greg Co. text in the paper was sent Tuesday afternoon at 123 after we spent three hours plus. And I mean, not the whole time we talked about a lot of other things in our own polls. We keep our own polls or ourselves. And whatever else I did, those boring bedtime stories. But we had a show. And we had a good show on Tuesday. And in the midst, we got people whipped up and they hopped on that thing there. So 123, he puts his sends this thing up. So you can just imagine why I have to do a clock when all these people started their Daisy chain, plus whatever they were doing on here. And even if they weren't doing anything on here, I everybody. And they were going through the white pages of the phone directory. Look at this thing. 123 on Tuesday. And all of a sudden, but I beat. But above, let's vote for your favorite and crush the Q.I.M. Here's the link says Alan T. Brown, Vice President of Communications in Hanks is a real A-hole, major A-hole. He hates him like poison. That is bad. His number, by the way, is 954 989 3335. Want to call him and bitch him out. That a good idea. Well, some other people want to do that. Yeah. What? I ain't going to call him. No, I don't mean you. I'm talking to the audience. You think I just do the whole show for you? Only about 40%. Yeah. A-hole. And it's 790 to ticker.com. I mean, he must be really the A-position. You think? In fact, maybe you'll hire a, what's your name over there? What the hell is your name? Oh, the energy. The energy. I saw the energy. I saw the energy. Oh, she's what I'm talking about. Talk about our real, wow, what a bitch. Yeah. Anyway, so how are we doing? Let me refresh it. It's like tick and mince, breath mince. We got $2,000 already. We've gained a net of 15 votes. Speaking of refreshing. Yes. And in my mouth, I found a match. I found a cigarette lighter. So Josh is good. Oh, good. More. He can breathe a little easier now. Literally. Yeah. We got $2,000 votes even. Baby, in the bad guys, over across seven, I knew the ticket. Those guys are literally got $2270. And they started with $2178. So slowly, but surely, thanks to our loyal and ineffective audience. I do. I'm doing it just to bust their balls of it. I just for fun so that they can pull it. And of course, that after I'm off the air, let's see who we got on. Today, I'll go the way. You know, he ain't gonna. Because his name is Nanna. And probably rightfully so. This is Neil Roger. This is 562A. Let's go with each other. Move it in a stool. Roll, win, play, what did you do? It just hit a foot. That wasn't quite true. Roll, roll, win, free defendant. James Frye. Don't we told the million little lies? Can we roll, roll, roll, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Alright, eight, eight, eight, for the apologized, just a moment. Oh, great. So The audience is not here, shall we move around tonight tomorrow take it a long time? We are in Children, little children on the street, homeless voice people. They actually were taken PCs out there in the street corner. Haven't had homeless voice people. It's half a mile. They were. Jim for Volas. Scott Becker, Beacher, whatever. A Jean Toledo. John Stugaz, a leader. Zach Cranz. Zach. He probably hates him like poison. But he's just got no choice because Moe pushed Zach. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Look, how other shove by the way. Jonathan Zazlo. I wonder if he's really the guy who used to be on guiding like the dog. Roger Thorpe. Remember him? No. Well, we got 2010 and the bad guys got 20 years, 290. So we're chopping into whatever is so lightly. I don't understand it because you tell me you can only vote once, right? And I guess we're right. Because that is a said, yeah. You, well, they're right. Because this isn't about a mind. Your vote was QAM on 130, right? At 837 AM, which what they was 1131, too. So I guess you got to clear the cookies. Well, I'm not going to go through all of that. But our audience has got a lot of time. They're not doing a radio show right now. They got 20 of time. It's just a question of how loyal they want to be and how much they want to do for us. You know, helping the helpless. Because it's all strictly me, man. It's me against the world. It's usual. Right? So we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, we know, so go ahead. I don't care. What do I give a crap? I don't do a sport show, but as far as which station, I mean, I'd like to look at at 2017, 2022, 95, we're like 207 and 78 behind. But we've picked up a net of seven votes all right. And what's the valuable factor starts kicking it? We'll be hit by 4,000. Put a call in that jackass once they let him out. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound five, 60, they've arrived in a singular wireless line. Okay, here's the pull result from yesterday. Who is the biggest no talent celebrity of all time? We had 16, 151 votes. Why sure which we can get that many today on this Greg Potex pull on his blog? There are only problems you can vote against or I guess we've exhausted all our audience, right? At least the ones who'll make the effort for us. Right. 1000s of additional people out of, oh, we're not going to do that. There we are. Yes, you are. So very least for the free entertainment and the farting sounds we used to give you. Certainly those people that are posting all day long, they got them. Yeah, that's my other, but there's only two or three of them. You're under 200 staying. That's what it's saying. They came to earth three. They can clear their cookies all day long. Yeah, and it literally made me have included in a cookies thing. It smells like something. Who's the biggest no talent celebrity of all time? Peris Hilton 474. She beats the opposition hands down. Rosie O'Donnell 126 actually Simpson 125. P. Diddy 119. I hate this pull 105. Dr. Phil 73. Take a pill, Dr. Phil. Hopefully, arsenic. Arnold Schwarzenegger 44. Terry Spelling 38. Adam Sandberg 36. Melissa Rivers 44. Vanillen by 33. Jail 31. Oprah. 30. Wendy Spirit 29. Ellen D. Jannwick 26. Wayne Newton 25. Then after 24 slides the low in Tony Vansie, 22. 21 for our senior hall and its Solomon and Wuppy Goldberg and K&R Reeves. 18 for Snoop Dogg. We did cause we had 17. Courtney Love 15. J. Letta when Madonna 14. Martha Stewart 10. Will Smith 9. Bob Dylan 8. Ozzy Osborne 8. Frank Kuss and after an emerald Gassy 7. Will Smith 9. Joe River 6. Courtney Carsonville Schatner and Bruce Willos 4. Tam Hunter Red 3. Hey, Tam. You fairer. Gary Moore 2 and D. Martin finally got one. Solomon and T. Wano. But he finally got one. He's drinking. Hey, Dean. You wish you a funny that Dean. When he finally. I believe. Yeah. This is kind of like this like a election day. And just like just like the presidential elections, it's fixed. Right. We got two thousand 34 and they got look. We got the same numbers. They just in different order. We got 203 40 got two 304 now. That's pretty mysterious 166 170. So we picked up now in net of. Wait, wait a minute. 270 is that correct? So we picked up 15 votes already. And just half an hour. Since I changed my mind, or nearly I was just going to let this thing go. But I just can't operate there. When I'm just one. I'm a fighter man. I'm a speed fighter like somebody. I'm a speed fighter. Yeah, that's why I'm going to get you all fired. Did it. You know, he's your favorite. I'm a shot. And didn't go in to get to somebody. Not coffee or. WDQ. Hello. All right. Good. I think the reason you enjoy. You get a lot of crank colors because you got the so boring and repetitive. Yeah. You know, you're talking to the fellows all the colors. You know, can you tell us the names of all the. And what kind of code you keep along. Yeah. For a sub boring. That's why you listen all the time. You can tell us every time if the guardler call and this one and the whisperer and everybody else. Okay. We're so boring. But you are life was obviously so desperate that we're even spice it up. That pathetic existence. There's a solution for it. Sir, you know your brains out. Please. How about an asses to suicide. In fact, maybe blow it back to right there. I'll be good. I'll. I'll assist. You'll assist. Yeah. Who am? Hello. Hey, you. Okay, pal. Listen. There's a little thing that. You're a program or call a bot as you short for robot. And make it right a little. Probably that will cost a leak clear that and hit that. Clear. The bot. That's what's going on. That's why we've been getting a vote. They get one. I saw in as many votes as you want. You know, the real simple thing to do is maybe one of the listeners knows how to do it. Yeah, but 40 of the listeners don't have to do that ought to be doing that. And also Eric could probably do that up there. Eric's computer wizard. Come on. I'm not sure. I'm going to. Thanks, pal. Now, what is this again? It's just automatically like keeps a rehab. It's a little program. And he's right. They're called bots as a matter of fact. Like, I don't know if you've ever used the email on our own website. But before you can get into it, there's a little thing that you have to reply to. Yeah. So that people that use fan bots don't don't take over the email addresses and use them for spamming. So yeah. So yeah. Somebody that knows how to do it can write a bot that will basically keep voting continuously. Well, wouldn't that be nice? Because you can be sure they're doing it. In fact, that's probably why we're doing on the Tuesday and Wednesday. That is really scandalous if you ask me if you ask Alan T. Brown. Hey, Brownie. You're doing it. Now, let's say 248 and 15 with 263. We're traveling into a by 22 votes already. Even though they got those things going their botnet, their baton and their botanists. 252 for the good guys and 2315 for the pretenders over there. Where there's 75,000 memos on. Oh, let's get everybody you know and strain yours on the street corner. Oh, brother, we didn't own this. Grand Cody is doing a web pool on radio wars and sound 40s. Looking for your favorite, at least David Rose. Please vote and let's crush the Q.I.M. Let's crush them all. I do like an orange crush. I haven't had one those in years because they... Oh, guess what? I got some good news boys and girls? Yeah, late on it. Well, well, you don't really care that much. You don't drink a lot of diet soda. Yeah, do. You do? You have a heavy diet lime. Huh. Isn't that incredible? I know they had the coke lime for a while, but I'm just telling you. Listen to me. Not just Pepsi lime. Lime Pepsi is going to lime. Pepsi diet lime. I can't drink regular anything anyway. Well, I'm just telling you. All of it go look. I had Pepsi lime man. I'm dieting over here. If they tasted it, they'd have it done here in Cuba. And also, I'm not a bottle of every... They're like in the bottles. Not the teeny tiny bottles, but tiny right away. How it is. Point. WDQAM. Yeah, feel free. Yes, sir. Speaking. Oh, Dale, how are you doing? All right. I'm just one of these people that listen to... Did I... Did I... Did I... Did I... Did I... Did I... Did I... Did I... Did I... Did I... It was all right for everybody listening to it, too? All right, anyway. Keep up the good work. OK, thanks, palen. By the way, Georgetown is a good movie for a track which is a current movie and he will talk about it when it starts to sound really 2021. Yeah, and I'll be sending you a copy.

Have a round of applause. Thin did. in 265 is 235 and 23258. Now, what's 285? So you see the numbers have changed, but only the guilty have been protected by the innocent. 258. So we're cutting into a 27. See that? And pretty soon it'll be. So even though they got there, bots are going. They're bots and balls. What's in the bot? Yeah. They got their bots and balls. Alan's he Brown. And I have no idea who that is. I didn't realize that there was another, another, an individual doing consulting in town. This is Neil Rogers. This is by 162. This is the Neil Rogers. Yeah. All new all three save. Oh, we look like it's a thing. I'm gonna have to hop inside my company. Call. I got the ticket. The casher beat that up I have. I'm gonna think if you were ready, you'll be strong. I'm gonna say, Bob, baby. I can do anything I want to do. I'm gonna make a something you put in the back door. I got the power to know they can roll. Well, I have a way to get to your own show. I'm a station down in Hollywood. And I don't care. You call ratings alone. This is one that you can stroke, please. I'm on the same guard, I need it. And you'll do anything I want to do too. I'm gonna get something for you. That's why I'm like insulting because I'm just an asshole. Oh, I got it. I was soon able to forget. That was great. I'm not sure if you can get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a one quick go to register and to be safe in an ammo signing for a outcome on a crew. Professor Damicle. When a leader in the team ran for the next four years on the field, who didn't even really talk that he want to go out in the crowd. Here we go. in his diapers every half hour. You lose Allen, okay, Allen T Brown. A lot of bad Browns, like you know it? Cleveland Browns, Brownie Brown, and our Allen T Brown. I said you're a loser, Allen. Who has the least self respect, 569 votes? In fact, you know something that's an Allen T Brown of his poly, you gotta try? Allen T Brown, cause if you had any self respect he wouldn't be putting a memo out of this like all these like the janitor and the dry cleaner and people who like our pressing their burst of their suits over there, he would be sitting that out. That's one thing we go on here and have a little bit of fun with it, but it's another thing. Two, like I like, this is important, seven. And like hold the whip over everybody's head, you will get on this thing and you will crush QIAM, you'll crush them. Right. God, it just said. The least self respect, colon, power 110. Courtney, lug 95. I hate this pool 93, I'd like to vote for that. The QI am sports staff, 81, it won't even stand up for themselves. That's how sad our people are, I just say, we don't want it. Perisult, 81, Matt Fudge, 38, a Matt. You're fairies. So hitting, oh brother. I'll tell you, Dr. Mangala would have had a really good time with her. Ron Jeremy, 33, Jack Abramoff, 22, Robert Downey, Jr. 16, and the other one we've just put him on our Allen T Brown, Vantan Allen Brown. Got him? Got him, good. 560, 70, 560, stay tuned, cause I'm gonna read that memo again. 20 or 30 more times and the email address. What a jackass. Okay, let me refresh this. And now how we doing? You guys still voting over here. I'm looking at him. 2106, look at that. We've come a long way, baby, from a Paul Fee, 1893. Remember 1893? Not a very good year, though. 107, 213. Look at the way we're zooming up there, man. Oh man, it's shocking. And now the margin is down to 241 from 285. We picked up 44, and we're never leave work, Kelly, number 44, if it had taken Brown before you were born, no. No. No. Well, I do. He could carry, give me the ball. 560, 70, 560, pound five, 60, and the Verizon, and Singular Wireless Line. Police apologize and dropped the charges versus Cindy Sheen and that other broad. Capital police dropped the charge of unlawful conduct against Andy W. active Cindy Sheen, the Estadena apologized for rejecting her and the Congresswoman's wife from President Bush's state of the Union address for her and teachers with war messages. I apologize. The officers made a good faith, yeah, good faith, my ass, but mistaken effort to enforce an old, unwritten interpretation of the prohibitions about demonstrating in the capital, capital police, chief Terrence Gainer said in the statement late yesterday. The policy and procedures were too vague, he added, that faded rightfully for paraphernal officers, his mind, he said. If extraordinary statement came to the after-police from O'China and Beverly Young, wife of representative, C.W. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. From the visitors gallery Tuesday night. She and was taken away in hand-puffs before Bush's arrival at the capital in charge with Mr. Meiner while Young left the gallery, and therefore was not arrested again. And seeing that last night, they showed a type of Cindy B. B. B. B. B. B. B. B. and out there and they say, oh Cindy, she is escorted from the capital. I guess, watch, he was being arrested. You javodated and put that on the end. No. And that's because Mrs. Limbaugh, who's underright, now she probably was editing the news. Neither Gashit have been confronted about the expressive t-shirts Gainer's statement said. Gainer added that he was asking US attorneys or if he's been dropped to charge against you. The statement also said he apologized to the Young's and shared that apartments plans for avoiding this in the future. I am not here like that. I had a controversial teacher who would just be John. A similar message has been left with Ms. Xi and he said. For his part, the Young's state wasn't necessarily satisfied. My wife was humiliated and told reporters he suggested that sensitivity to it may be in order for capital polis. A foreign board of American citizen with the guests of representative L.C. Hastings of Florida was also taken by police in the gallery just about to house floor. Hastings met with Gainer and said he also requested meeting with House Speaker Danny Hastings about the incident. I'd like to find out more information has to say that I didn't find the mental needs being from Broward County. He said constituent of mine I even invited him probably said L.C. L.C. Baby. She and Stuart where we know about the t-shirts within today yesterday. I'd be fit to put through that. I said they apologize which doesn't cut the mustard. L.C. Hastings we don't know about his buddy from probably a subversive though. Probably a Democrat. All of it is here's the testimony going on about Katrina. He just had a tornado on your door and you see that? Bill, I didn't because God is man. He is man. He wants a chocolate gnarling. Well maybe talk about a stir the chocolate. That could be it and then drink it. Maybe it's oval teen. I know it's disgusting but I see oval teen out of the jar with us just a little bit. Just think about that then. Just when you're in your mouth. You get in there. Oh, nice texture to it. Mmm. Just melt right on your tongue. Mmm. 2358 pretty guys over there the pretenders. 2358. Let's do the math again. Let's go to the video tape. 2358. Is Warner will still lie by the way? Nobody knows. 9, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 9. Oh, pretty soon it's going to be under 200. It was almost 300 when we started the choke. And once we get those bots up here, how many we got? I'm in my 40. They're going to be something 30 in there like. Like, uh, rapid fire baby. Even the bush people can fix the most spices we're going to do it. How many they can? So anyway, Alan Brown writes, what it would be interesting to find out who this was that brought this in and dropped it off for us from over there. I mean, they get fired right away or whoever sent it over. Huh? No need to know. You sure there is. I heard I saw a guy. I heard Stugotson and he walked it right over. He walked it over and thrown in parents's box. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, and leave a rising and singular. Wireless long. Look at that. There's not a call on the board man. And they're wondering, why is there always you right in their bot? You think? Then let's see it. And that's got to be it. They're, they're under computers right now. They're hooking up. Because they're going to do us a few of his service. They're proud of QAM. I mean, you've got to have a little bit of pride. Not too much when you work here, but for the beesleys. But just a little bit. You got to put your best foot forward. Fight to good flight, right? Right. You'll be able to see four behind that. They're two, three for now. We've got another bunch. Oh boy, they're going to start really jumping jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump. You'll see. You'll be able to smell them all over across the street. 5, 6, 7, land. What is this with this phone here? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, and leave a rising and singular. Wireless long. They got nothing for their our pole for about having a little self-respect. I told you it wasn't a good pole. And that says I want to concentrate again on the other one. I still think that if people, in fact, if you're in the office right now, you go to somebody else's PC, right? I don't know how to do it. Just like our pole where it's the ISP, with one person to go to the building that you're locked out. Get out of here. Are you crazy? Well, that's how ours works. I don't know how there's work. If one person votes in the building you're locked out, well, how does that pass? If they got there going in, we'll be there across the street, vote in 10,000 times. Give me a break. Be voting from home. They're voting from home? I don't think so. Maybe they're going to go in the different buildings. They're going to go to the people's quarters. Maybe they didn't cookies over there. Well, that's okay. You had nothing faster than cookies. No, okay. Putting some of that sponge cake in that dark rich strawberry. Well, what was the raspberry chocolate? Oh, yeah. And people are chocolate and milk chocolate. Oreo cookie crumb marshmallow chocolate. Oh, the Oreo cookie crumbbles over the marshmallow. Like a damn on the... Amoretto. Yeah, I don't think the right leg in life's the white chocolate. WCOM. Hello. Stop! Stop! WCOM. Hello. Good morning, Neil. How are you? Okay. Good. I was listening to a high-life from Joseph Gacky about when the UN-1 was playing. I was playing some Joseph. Wow. Whatever. It had like a little flop there yesterday. Well, you should get in theory. What did we have? Let me tell you. Compared to Kermit's a frog from the Muppet Show. It's exactly the same freaking way. Oh, my! Oh, my! There you go. Ever seen together? Same middle-same person. Joseph Gacky or... Oh, my! Oh, my! Old Pudonhead. Or whatever I used to call. 560, 560, pound 560, and the horizon, cigarette-wiredless line. Need to wait this cut up today. They're not on top of this like they were on Tuesday. And that's partially my fault. We should've kept banging away on it again yesterday. No? This goes the other people on this case. We don't line. We don't line up. We don't give enough time to talk about it, you know, that. We didn't deal with the Boss. We didn't deal with the Boss. We didn't deal with the Boss in the Sea Rocks in the Sea Rocks in the Sea Rocks in the Sea Rocks in the Sea. And the Coors. How can you forget about that? And we love the panthers. They lost again. I'm sorry. I get so emotional. I think about those phony attendance numbers. Do I have any QAN? Hello. No, you're confusing me with these fold. What's your when are we on? What's everyone you like? Pick and pull you like. And then a little more. you more? No, okay. Do you want to kill a young? No. Yeah. I think I got one for your phone. No, so fast back, yes? Well, it's a difficult phone man. It's not good sighting. How about Jose Caine's take a little man? No respect for himself. Excellent choice about standing. I like him. Jose Caine's take a little man. He's a killer. I mean, killing anybody but he just kills us with his behavior. Come in his brother, Azi. And of course he never did no steroids except, you know, except all of them. When he was alone with somebody. No, actually, and many changes might do it. And not only that, he changes mine after he wrote the book first. First, they were great for you and they're like, the sports, the tool of the future, who is going to be doing them on the head, they hear, and he's all I didn't mean that. I changed my mind. They're baby bad, you know. But then he changed back after the after the house. He changed basically. He got in by his book again. And Susan Rafi Paul Merrow, that was bad. Chris, it's not to be true, but never. And then there was Ellie and Rosanna. Oh, Rafi, you're such a credit to the community. We have 14 streets named after you and all the members of your family. And he loves that Cuban restaurant like her. Oh, boy. What a funny bitch. Ellie and Rosanna, my ass. How do you do that? 2148 2364. That's 216. Can it is it possible that the margin is narrowed that much dramatically. How do you like that? Oh, my God. Exactly. Our people are coming through for us today. Maybe by two o'clock. We're going to be ahead of them if it's the last. If I have to like eat about 400 cookies. You know what I'm saying? Oh, do that. You know, the kind of cookies are like I can't think of what they call them. P. K. And Sandy's now. They got like um, I don't mean more like sugar white sugar coating on them like, uh, and what you call them. Sugar much sugar cookies. No, not sugar cookies. Michael, no. Sandy paid me all of a color more like. I know. And I'll start with a cookies. Okay. I did so when you started with a cookie. I did a nice wood bind day. I lost two pounds yesterday. And about a 191. I'm feeling like human again. You're and the good news is that George has taken his picked up the cudgel man and he's swinging it. What George is our liaison with clearance. David, every day. So I don't have to listen all like me. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. See why I'm in such a better mood today. Is that one? God, I see that that because I told Dick stock and I'll burn you on. This is Neil Rogers. This is five 162A. And we can play a baby. Well, a bullet gunshot, maybe you could bring it on, a kiss coat. Yeah. Yeah. You'll see that supposed to have a crisp gangster microphone? C'mon. Oh, that was seven in the room. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Deep Waar Mickey. Oh, one of the You like the perfect album, there's a reason why the tracks don't cover the theory here. Right, though. Now I'm almost wearing that sweater. I'm like the perfect album, you're fairies. Okay, so now what's the story? You're saying you mean that? Because Bokeb Rines and we like a whole bunch of stuff. We're sending it south Parkfield. Yeah, those are all from me. We're about in the closet. How many crews? Hey, Tommy. You're fair in the Bloody Mary episode of the South Park, which you probably won't ever see on TV again. Really? Yeah. Well, it's technically got a whole different way. Definitely won't. Well, I'm done with it. I've got them teeth and I've got one ballsy out of it. Always looks like he's going to fart in your favor. Outra, evil guy. Really? Yeah. If the Catholic church is outra, it's going to be great. That's just special. And if anybody deserves to be outraids, how them priests do when it ones it like a musting all in little kids. They're doing fine. Double doke. Okay, let's see how the voters come. I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised here. I think somebody is hot on it. Oh my God, we're out of 200 even. We picked them almost 100 votes and it's in less than an hour. And hour power. I bet you we got like 300 and bots. If you're a sports ace, you might have your bots involved. Especially in the Marlins. That's a stock demand. That was a hoot. That was pretty funny. He realizes he's stinks. You know what? What? Wait to be here this. Okay. Well, now first I got to do the bad news from Iraq. I know that's bad because if you're very cold, we're fine. There is a bomb tied in there a T stand. I wonder if Joe Caroio was there. Maybe he was throwing that T.C. I can't afford his wife. You stand. Can you get a T back there? No, but you can go to the T room right next door. A bomb tied in there a T stand killed eight men waiting for a day labor. If we're daily, we're in largely a she-eyed area bagged at a six other people that had violence across the country. So there let's see eight and six is 14. A she-eyed politician tapped as a possible prime minister predicted a new government within place by mid-March. In the morning attacked on the impoverished laborers in the capital's new bagged that area appeared aimed at further inframing the sectarian intentions in this war ravaged country. War ravaged country. Isn't that interesting? Because before we invaded there and occupied it, it wasn't where ravaged it all. Well, they should have attacked us. Where she hides accusations with sooneria, absent reprisal killings and kidnapping at the other end. Police said at least they meant we're more than 50 wounded men. Of course, see the wounded is just like a generic term. We don't know about how many lins were lost, how many eyes, a sign of their family, all of these party parts. Now this story here is great. It's about a word. Yeah, really? I bet you never thought I have a story about the word. Yeah, got that right. Yeah. And Al Pacino probably never thought we would be hoping we didn't because that will be a so bad, the Senate of a woman. I mean, there's one scene, the courtroom scene, that's fine. It's good. The rest of the blows. My favorite part is where he gets in the visit of vet. He was driving, I think he's just driving a vet or a Porsche or something like that. And on the streets in New York, he's blind. And Chris O'Donnell, a senator with him. Oh, turn left, uh, in about two seconds. And turn right away. And of course, there's no pedestrians. There's only 10 million people. There's so I would be pedestrians in New York. But anyway, it's ridiculous moving. It sucks. See if a blind guy would drive in the South Florida. We wouldn't think anything up. No, of course not because they probably just got his license renewed. Like I did in the mail. But anyway, Al Pacino says, who about 400 times in a movie? The US Army, which has so many acronyms expressions and opaque phrases that it seems to deserve its own language. There is one word that is quite possibly other than any other. The word is, and actually in this story, when I went with said O'CNN, it actually tells you how it's who I pronounce. Alternatively spelled HUA and HUA, which is called HO-A-TUMA. Right. I tend to come in a committee and maybe you'll hear, HU-A. Other dissolving is a 15 year old says like, or you know, heads of the posters changing by a TOOMA energy bar or WET wipes or POOA-TU-O water, H-O-O-A-H. H-O-A, H-O-A, H-O-O water. I must be a Canadian thing. It's not just an Iraq, a US bases around the world. TOOMA. Seems an inseparable element of Army life. Just don't try to define it, and definitely don't try to figure out where it comes from. Now, you say that on your deathbed, you say, femper five first, or you say, first. femper five? What do you say first? Neither. Oh. I hear, they have a new thing, Mr. Hey, say that. I have a lot of fun. Just don't try to define it, and definitely don't try to figure out where it comes from. I believe it came from H-O-R-A. It basically means everything from yes and yes or to that's great. It said Captain James, low fever, Clever's office, number of the 506-R-Dramidal Combat Team. If you use it as a generalized cheer, it's like raw, raw, Cisco and buy, you know? Right. It's one of those multi-purpose phrases when it doubts say, POOA. That doesn't begin to cover it. They shall who are, or they started to get motivated, they whisper when they can hear what something somebody just said. POOA means you understood something, and you're not going to be a proper reply when somebody says, Thank you. Thank you. Like, forget about it. On the other hand, it may also be used to say, thank you. Or like, Craig O. Craig O. And then, you know, I'll tell you it's spaghetti sauce. But it's Italian, Craig O. And then Dutch, I'll still believe, there it means like, there you go. And in fact, when you're on KLM, when you're flying like the Amstet, I'm which will be very soon, I'm sure. Right. And it, like, give you the, you know, in business class, they give you the business. They give you the kit with the, the schmatha for your feet, and all the whole deal. And they, you think, thank them. And I'll still believe, there you go. Everything goes on. I'll still believe like the hookers there on the, and the red light district. I'll still believe there it is. There you go. I see. Give me the cash and get out of here. So anyway, there you go. There's a story about who I will tell you, and see, there ain't no other educational show in America that's given you to do a Puhas story, is there? Oh, many times. You're guys are so boring. You're so bad. You're so bad. What are how many of those stupid things on your, a fat boy sent and his boyfriend or the, or probably off from the same two people, Eddie and his boyfriend, 20, 2, 6 team, we've cut it under 200. Candle is in less than an hour. It's that damn gun. Power. Man, which way come out when it was Neil got power bars? What are they going to do? We're going to put it on. You'll be seeing who ha on the throne, huh? What are they going to taste like? Hmm. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Like, ha's in favor of sauce. You're going to taste like curry man. I can't come back from wood by last night. I had an Indian or an old pack. The ones with the turbines are packies, right? Yes. Yeah. I had a packie. Very good driver though. Like Raymond and Raymond. He's a very good driver, but oh my, they're the seats wherever they're from. It's a little better than that. No man. Now I'm not so sure if it was him or just the whole kid because he sits in their all day that had the curry infusion. You know? Oh, good girl. I thought it was going to soon. Maybe they'd use curry by wash. There could be it. WCWA and how are you? Okay. New or as far as the RUIA are the angles for the military that we are. Yeah. It's kind of a motivational speech when you got, when you need your big guy. I'm not saying that right. Say not who you are. Well, yeah, but you kind of reading it other than what? You got to say we're a little more more patient like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, that's not who you are. Sir, sir, you weren't in the military. I wasn't there. I don't care. I thought you were going to know. I didn't know. I wasn't in the military. You're the same right. I wasn't. I was too fat. Thank God for asking. Yes. Who you are, Daddy? That's why that was. That was the way he was saying it. Who you are, Daddy? That's probably what he was asking me. Not me. That's one thing. I'm not responsible for all this over population. It's going on. Always unwanted babies to earth. This is needle Rogers. This is a needle Rogers. This is 5.62. 8. Don't take my flat very. No take my flat very. You wait me. It makes the world to me.

I'll tell you having been on radio myself. I can tell you that my program Director would try to slay me what I would go to the video tape. Yeah, you would never really want me to do it. Why not? You know, just the reason you set me. Let me come on. You're a smart guy. You know, I thought I was so smart. How come I'm working for this outfit? Well, hey, I mean, come on. You're living in a great apartment somewhere far away. You got to make it a lot if you get For a question about that man. If a word for Q a my life would be perfect. Trust me. Listen, let me tell you. Any man who gets to work in his underwear from home and gets the money that you get. How come in the guy? Exactly. I'm a genius. Like I said, listen, how are you? You want to tell us you're going to remain in time. I work for it. You'll be 93 fantastic FM Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. All right. And these days, our work is a job of the city of New York. Hello, all right. You're on the right now. Yeah, I'll be there. The second thing I wanted to know. How many of you did you think? You're not to get us an algal steam to an alcatrazor. I mean, to like, although I've met algal in a number of times because I'm a cigar smoker. And Alan, I or kind of brothers of the leaf. And you. Are you a fat shoe? I am and he is to it. I'm a problem. I'll tell you. If you're a fat shoe, then you and I will have something in common. I know I'll very well trust me. I don't, I don't like to refer to myself as a fat shoe, but I'll tell you a great story. Yes. I was at New York, Sammy the bull, Giovanna one day. He had been in the newspaper for the New York Post the day before. And they described him as the stocky thick, Giovanna. And I said to him, hey, you know, Sammy, be in the script of stocky. Really not so bad. And he said, hey, you said, maybe stocky is good for you. He said, look at your belly. He said, stocky is no good for me. So, you know, but you don't really want to cross any bone marrow. Now you should have told him by the way, the word is perfect anyway. The other thing I want to tell you, was respect to a sense of a woman. Yes. Having worked in Brooklyn for many years, I can tell you that's a story. Who are you? Hey, Neil, who are you know, I think you adopt that term. All of your colors will start using it when they call this a story. I'm sure they were all not. Now, woman, not the streets in Brooklyn, their empty is your saying. They are empty. And when that film was made, now that is in dust-free old Brooklyn. That is pretty real. That is pretty real. His phone's down under them and hadn't rich. They refer to that as dumbbo. And at the time that that film was made, those streets were in seed entirely. That's true. I would think so, yeah. Yeah, I mean, there's major renovations going down, going on down there now. And people are beginning to live there, it's becoming a very residential area. But back then, those old cobblestone streets of Brooklyn and the empty as anything. Well, I'm sure that Al Pacino is driving in the sunrise right now with the same shades of... I got my eyes closed and I'm driving right down the university. Perfect. Perfect. Fitted like a rubber glove. Okay, thanks a lot, Your Honor. All right, brother, be well. Yeah. He's a judge, man. You've got to have respect. If you need to judge, respect Your Honor. Thanks a lot, your name is Alito. I never liked that. I'd like to do say that the judge at the end of a trial. Personally, if you want, of course. Thank you, Judge. Thank you, Your Honor, sound like so much more dignified. I just sound like a real man, anyway. Good fact, you wish for it from Brooklyn, from where he's from. Okay, how's the pull coming to you? I dare refresh it because this could be a little shock to my sister. Now I could have a heart attack. Twent... Oh, no! The next time that we report after this very brief break, we could actually be in the lead, Alan T. downtown Brown. We see male addresses eight brown at 790 the ticket dot camera. At least it probably used to be vacant on all. FUH! FUH! Is it that a hoot? Isn't that a Hua? Let's see... 24... We're 22 behind... I guarantee right now I'm going to go out of the limb. I will bet your fat boy and... ...lials life on it that... ...and what we'll be in lead. This is the real Roger, it's the first one. This is five, sixteen, sixteen, six. We got to leave. You'll look at the glory home first there with the James Copa diet. Hey everybody, look at me! But now there's a new diet that guarantees you'll lose one round or more in nine years or less. Well, your money back. It's the Al Sharpen Strike diet. Oh, where are the O'er? What should I actually do? Is it a post-unbebiscini hall real bad that you get angry? See? Staff y'all beat. And oh, the chicken eggs and your mouth like this. Everything. Our viewers, are you? We're just about to have a thing. So, try the new Al Sharpen Strike diet. And with every pound you lose, Al will personally resize your ranges. It's... It's 745, a QAM. Critical phase in Iran's standoff is at a honor Iran. This phase is I can't... ...where I head by to land a pole. Think that Alenty Brown, two of you. Yeah. Hey, Alon. You're fairie. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors is debating whether to report Iran to the UN Security Councilman's arrest by the Islamic State to start a Marching Iranian where if it's nuclear activities are sent to the council. Oh, my God. There is an assortment among board members. Let the report the Iranian issue now to the Security Council, right? A later stage. I, A, A, A, A. Directed General, my Hamid Al Baradai said. Al Baradai said, all the members agreed as the UN Security Council should not take any actions. Mainly impose any sanctions until Al Baradai presents his report on Iran's nuclear program to the board in March. And that, a hoot that Dick stocked and loves this show and, plus by the fact that he knows that he knows I know. If the referrals are laid till next month, it could help both of the opportunity for negotiations to get Iran to hold its nuclear activities. Al Baradai said that moves to report Iran to the UN Security Council not a crisis, but a window of opportunity. And resolving the stand-up. A window of opportunity, it's a phrase kind of like, you know, person of interest. Right. Don't you love that one? Lots. We are reaching a critical phase, but it isn't in no way a crisis situation to reporters. Earlier Iran's IAEA Ambassador A told CNN's Becky Anderson was a real bubblehead and a simple denobnoxious. She's almost as bad as Richard Quest. She told Becky that if his country's referred to the council, it'll begin large-scale enrichment of uranium and nuclear facility in Natan's. So don't the piss of soft we're going to start like Nukin' it. And Nukin' it and then these railies and the Iranians and but a beat, but about then it's going to be like, and it will have Armageddon and we can all cope together. And the Jews are all going to burn in the hell and the go-am are all going to go to the letter. And the Muslims are going to be doing an emergency. All it will be great. It will be in the higher. Shall I refer to this thing because it seems like we passed them like they're in slow-mo. I mean, maybe obviously tap it out a lot of phony votes, which I, because it's the off. Which are the big two states you prefer for sports radio. We start in almost 300 votes down when we, when I decided to get back on this. See, when I make up my mind, we don't fail. Don't want to say it. What do you say? I'm saying screw them. Screw well and brown. Hey, Alan, your mama. WDQA in 2556, 790 to 2, 790 to 2, 2530. We got it by 26 votes and pulling away. Like secretary in the bell-mont. Like a big machine, mine. Like a good machine. As a chicken, Risen would say, when he was shaving you, he croaked chicken. It was shave on one morning. Great race and out. Race color. Before I'd Dave Johnson, which means he must have been long time ago. Anyway, he had croaked. He was shaving. That's not a good idea. We have a sharp object in your hand. 567, of course, when you have a dog object in your hand. 567, 056, he pound. 560, he Verizon and singular wireless line. To wait to put that line up or not. I don't know if we're going to make men, their offenses with these sports parents. We don't want a puppy. Y'all need two to four in the most lot. Why don't we do something about that? About that most lot. What is that? Is this correct? Is that Peter King again? From 3 to 3. 30? I have one question about that. I want to stick my nose in the sport. What do you know about that? Mad Dog is smoking bones in four lot of day, four to seven. Pre-Kin hotline at Bernie Cosa's steakhouse, seven to nine. Because the beats is up there in Detroit, Lock it around on 12th street in the dark. Josie is going to do the 910 hour Bernie Cosa's steakhouse. That should be really. Okay. Exciting. And then it's a no ball game. No hockey game. No button. No bachi ball. Not going on. No chest tournaments. No poker. Oh, thank God that celebrity poker thing is dying out. Not that I ever watched it. But it's just you embarrassed to be a human being when you're like channel surfing. You see a bunch of guys playing cards. Yeah, whatever. Next we'll be having old made tournaments on the sunrise. All of a sudden. Nice, Blake, sunny. W2AM, hello. Thank you. Yes, sir. Good morning, you. When is the... I just wanted to be heard about the beating show on the WIOG or Saturday morning. Yeah, we heard it. And then he's got a face for radio. He does. Yeah, they have to whiteen that. So thank you studio. To make the... Okay, thanks. Thanks for the people of temp. Yeah, somebody told us about that old news, Jim Daphit. He's the schmussy looking. You know, they like that one bits. They have amazing things called razors, you know. And body watch. I can imagine him who... See if he had soap or beat English because he can never bend down to figure it up. He makes Hank look like a little miss muffled Jim Daphit. Good God, he's one of the more... You saw him right? Yeah, I saw him. Oh my God. I'm telling you, it's... It's... Body nevins with a bicycle pump stuck up. That's the... That's the ballooning and ballooning. All of a sudden, my almost burst. His gut actually hangs down below his knees. Oh my God, he is a monster in the... You're a realistic vinnist. That's what Periscillin said. 2608 2536 were head by 72 votes. We are going to leave them in the sawdust. We're going to leave them so far in a rears that... Well, and you know something Joe Rose, thanks Joe for bringing this sending over this thing to us. See because Joe would know where to leave it. And if Joe came over, and I mean, nobody would keep him out of the building, right? We love Joe Rose. That's right. Joe Rose, two to four, how's that sound? A band. I'll ride a little though. Little Mark's all by the man dog, dog. Somebody QAM, hello. You know, yes, sir. I just wanted to say a few things about our lovely president. Go in and help. Hopefully the dream police won't come and get me. He really is a communist. No, he's a fascist. Really? I mean, he goes... He's a mate. With the... Oh, is this... Go for it. Go for it. Go for it. I wonder how long he rehearsed that. Do you think he practiced that over and over a week? And when that good, that police is a seren sound effect. That was really very impressive. That was a... A four-year-old police car. No, listen, no, wait a minute. You don't understand. Oh, yeah, I do. No, you don't. You don't understand. Just stop and think about this. If he wasn't calling us with that... Schmidt. And he wasn't all of us with that. No, no, that was... I was gonna say, Swill and I pretended like... But anyway... He'd be out there doing something. I'm sure he'll be dangerous on his way now. Right. So it's good that he was on a phone. Just like all those people were tapping off the two or three people. All those, you know, phony emails. It's good. It keeps him busy. We're headed by 90 votes. 26, 30, 25, 40. And they're like, uh, stuff. Cause that's all they got anyway. That's their whole audience. And they're staff voted 10 times. And then the people across the street. Now let me ask you, why? Cause I haven't really paid any attention. Yeah. The Jefferson pilot building that used to be, um, 790, Waxi. And then it was, uh, whatever it is now. The NS Collins Memorial Law. The NS... The Road here. Yeah, where exactly is it? Uh, just on the other side, right? Right. On the other side, just a few blocks. North of this. Yeah, but that's what I'm asking. A few blocks. But I mean, like South of County Line Road? Uh, yeah. Wow. Very close. Very close. Man. Like close enough to throw like a... I don't know. But down in the end. Woo! Good, golly Miss Molly. Well, there they are. And of course, they're probably, uh, probably somebody like I told you. Want to know where this came from. Joe Rose leaked down early this morning on his way to work. And he dropped that off. Cause that's definitely his printing on there. So as Neil and Georgia came upon this email, thought of my, a museum signed Joe Rose, aka a friend. Might be from Joe, you think? He hate like a Joe finder. Oh, my god, this spot. And Alan Brown, forget about it. Browny Brown? Man, he's like a turn him Brown. WDQAM, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? All right. I think I want to roll through the store live in December when I was up in New York. I'm a little bit of a kind of company for from a Harrisburg troll me. The whole Warner World story story story. I already still go into the video tape, right? Right on. I just missed that. I wanted to bring up and, and following that, that great call just now. Talking about the domestic surveillance and just a bush was just, I mean, going on for the state of the union. You just stop and think about able danger. You remember what that is, right? Yeah. I mean, they actually tried. In for me, I mean, it's just such a hypocrisy that they want to talk about. The domestic surveillance went when they were, they were doing it back then. And had the people and they shut them down. They didn't want them to be vented. Of course. Look, you look, when you're in business with people and they're doing evil things, you know what your business partners to be a little found, right? You're right. Neil 911 was an inside job, brother. And I'm buying it. Later. And they're selling it. I believe it. Worse isn't bin Laden's baby. Demon and Burlusconi. It's the Beat Boys. Burlusconi. Emotion bin Laden. You remember Mickey Dang used to say, who's with the B? Bush bin Laden and Burlusconi. Burlusconi. It sounds so much schmals here though. It's had a tiny thing here. So, the Burlusconi sounds so, uh, you almost want to dance to it. I got to be honest with you. When I, this sounds ridiculous. But when I was watching that standing in the shadows, I loved to know it's ago. Yeah. And Jonas born was doing what becomes the broken heart. You just get so into that. And I was almost wanting to cry. I mean, it's so fabulous. Just watching that whole thing. That's obviously really enjoys the song. Oh, they were not just her, but I mean, the funk brothers, the music. And just, uh, and see, I know it sounds stupid to say it. But the reason that it all sounds like the original, at least the, the music, is because it is. Yeah. And it's just like identical. See, I'm not one of those people that's thinking like live, concert album stuff like that. I want to hear the songs in the way they sounded originally on the, record. Yeah, I'll call it commercial music free. But I am. But all of these with great artists and, except for track, a con. But other than that, man, I'm telling you, you people, if you watch it. So you've got crashed to watch this weekend, which George says is ex-x-alent, see, and standing in the shadows of Moton, which I guarantee you, if you've got any taste in music or a life for just a little, it'll, let's, crank your chain. Am I right? Yes, it will. You'll be going around all weekend going over and over again. If you're singing all in song, you'll be tapping your toes, and tapping your nose. Okay, and I'll see. I had to, oh, I want to go back to the thing again. I don't want to keep harping on that, but we need to keep these people, because you know what they're going to be doing over there as soon as I go off the ear, because our people sure ain't going to be above. We're not going to do this. We're not going to get into what peeing contest with always guys, or just going to like, nor them. Yeah, right. See, the thing that pissed me off about that is because it gives them exactly what they want. When people see something in a newspaper, even as bogus as this deal is, they believe it. That's their whole concept over there. They want to create this, this phony image that all man, they're picking our ass and they're like, you're right. You can't even kick your own ass over there for quite six. You want to hear what Mark Eisenberg says about O.J. McDuffey, man. You may, I could even say it on the ear. 2684, 2546, William 130, eight votes ahead of them. We need to really crank it up now. I'll do folks out there. Now we need to put the pedal to your middle. Two, uh, that's it. Five, six, seven, up over. Did I ever get through the schedule or not? Or yeah, I did. I ain't ever know because I'm not too keen on it anymore. Because we don't want this.

That's one of my problems. 3,000 and 19 votes for her. Are we kicking their fat ass or what? Huh? Man. 3,019 her audience is really coming through true and blue. You never thought they would do it, did you? Oh, of course I thought they are kicking their ugly smelly nasty, Alan Brown ass. And there's nothing worse than an Allen ass. 3,019 to 26,019, and sounds like 400 trees will lead for us. And pull it away. So you're increasing it. Even the dibole people, I don't know. I, it's easy for me to say that, but look what happened on Tuesday. The same time when Allen Brown, downtown Allen Brown, put up his memory of desperation, and they started creeping all over the place. They sent out all their memos to everybody in the yellow pages, the white pages, the blue pages, the grid, the goiam pages. Yeah, how's that Christian wrestling come about away? Can we look that up in the Christian yellow pages? Okay. Yeah. Christian, how about the Christian white pages? How about the satanic yellow pages? Oh, I love those. This is my favorite. Maryland Mansons on every page. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pond, see if they'd be more worried about Charles Manson and Maryland Manson, then maybe they'd be on something. W2AM, hello. Hey, Neil. I certainly didn't tell me the truth. It's moving the gun. What do you mean by that? Maybe I just heard that some people said I thought it hurt. Where have you been? I was been off. He's been eight young and they paid him to go away. He had too much left on his deal. I was in my bag. Okay. There's our first response to our talk question about it. Oh my god. It sounded to me like he was, yes, it did sound like that. You're peeling his body parts with this. Yeah. Good. Good. We don't think they say it for a few fits. So maybe we should take like an instant pull us not to that. That would be like a rubbing salt and mose wound. And especially when Dick Stockton was ripping him this morning, he didn't actually say it, but he could tell, you know, hates him like poison. Man, he was just chuckling and churling about mose muscratt. W2QAM, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Did you see the five, did you see QAM? Five, 60 QAM, the place, the place for steak. Our weapon trying to get in touch with Neil. Speaking. Neil. Yep. Oh, dude. You got to play that Jim Manditch. All right. When he does the covers of the song. Well, let's see. I'm not sure what this Manditch part, one of Manditch part two. But I don't know what if I haven't heard part two or say how about Bob both. You haven't heard part two. You want this part and you got it? The Manditch August back singing more to him on the Manditch sing. On the two. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah. And now you're hasn't stayed. You always have me say you don't be a mad dog. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Here's a bad dog and you're in a changed route to the King. Hey, oh, this. No, man. It's all right. It's all right. The Mad Dog was just a little endivalent. But we asked him if he wanted to do it again. Not. I don't fix it. So we had moved the Ratsy family a little visit. And tell him either his brains or his signature would wind up on the contract. That's one of the fifth few. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And it's six. Oh, you do. A little bit out if you won't quickly. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my. But I was just a very good pass. Thirty five.

You gotta get them before they get us. Who has the least self respect? We gotta shout at the thousand on our own poll today, okay? Well, we are just kicking some big smelly bloody butt, you know? Right. On the other pole, we're like almost 600 votes ahead. Here's the, uh... We're almost 600 ahead. What does that? That's really close, B. Who is the least self respect? We got 801, that sounds like a lot of fun, and if we get like about 8 to 75 by the top of the hour, we got that baby lit. Colin Powell, 145, what a disgrace. He holds up a little vile. I was one of the vile stacks I have ever seen in my life at the UN. That was funny. I look at the answer, actually. I was in the, I lean him and, uh, cocker right is, and all the other garbage. And you're right. What a jackass. What a sellout. I hate this poll 133 is tied with importantly level 133, I say, a definite correlation. Periscillten 110, where she's on all the polls, I ain't you. Yeah, well, we're, we're, we're tinkling in the taxi cab that doesn't indicate a whole lot of a self respect. The queue has a sports stamp. We don't want it. We don't want it. We'll leave it all to the old equine, every queen ten to go because we don't want it. 92, you know. I don't understand it. I mean, it says for fun. It's certainly like a little change of pace of the lower sight, a little pizzazz, you know, spice it up a little bit, baby. Spice it up, get out some muscle and throw and stick it in there. Spice it up, little oregano. At least, for ten days oregano. Matt, bud, she's got 49. You're fairery. Self-hating queen. Ron's Jeremy 43. Look at Jack Gabriel off. He's got a thousand minutes. I think he's what he's going to get about 25 to 30. Democrats 27. They ought to be doing better than that. That was a good choice, whoever called it, and Democrats have no self-respect. He's most of them. They're so for the F from a million. Just moments ago. That's the one. Robert Downey, junior 19, Jose Consocco 14, and Alan T. Brown, has got six. How do you like that? I bet I know who they are, too. Gooshambe, Joe Rose, Stu Gats, Joel Feinberg, Howard Davis, and Mark Hockman. That's right. He should have seven. He's also who's there by Reggers. You're a step brother. That's dad. Greg Kote is doing a web pool on radio wars in South Florida. He's looking for your favorite, at least David Hose. Please vote and let's crush the QAM. Here's the link he writes on his stupid ass email. Tuesday at 123 after I was crushing their ugly nasty ass laden with all kinds of people that don't belong in here to say hello or goodbye. Well, maybe the goodbye part. God, toast and this one. All the retards, man. Sydney Rosenberg, who down I'm a skick-out of the studio. And they sit down here for rehab or whatever. Real swill. Have a swill day, Alan. And then he's got this Alan T Brown. And he's got the blog, you know, the link to it. Alan T Brown VP of communications, sport, thought, 790. The ticket. And, you know, with the number in the, a, a, a brown is 790 ticket, et cetera. Pretty sad. That, that by the way is his office number. I wouldn't give anybody's home number on a year. But that's his office. Who had a call on his press, you know, condolences for the fact we're going to kick their ass. Now that I'm on the case. Which of the big two states to be a preferred for sports radio of 3271 for QAM at 2641 for? So 90 the ticket. How do you like that? That sounds like 600 and guess how many? But 30 man. 630 vote lead. And we won't be gunned if I know. I'll say. I don't care about working with a bunch of pansies. Let me know. We don't want to stand up for ourselves. Who want to let the other guys make us look like a bunch of trained monkeys in the newspaper. Like I said before, granted it's all bogus and it's just for fun. But people believe what they're reading the newspaper even I heard all that. I know that comes with shocked and most of you. People see something in print and they say, oh, did you know that? Wow, it's in the paper must be true. So therefore, if we just sit back and let these guys pretend, which we know it's just a pile of crap, pretend that they're kicking our ass. It's not good for business. It's not psychologically good. And I for one, even though I don't do a stupid ass sports show, can you imagine if I was on there? Not that I want to pat myself on the erectory. They were kidding you. Imagine my god Alan Brown. He'd be, he'd be doing a Tom like this. He'd get in the card for it morning and high tailed right out of town. Well, Alan Brown with the windows up, not down. He'd be rolling around with his windows up. Anyway, so Alan Brown's got six, but I'm sure he's working on that. Get goose him up a little bit. Thanks by the way, Joe Rose, we're bringing up the email by that. That didn't inspired me. Otherwise, we wouldn't even waste it our time with this, right? Because I was just ignoring it. And of course, when they know I'm not going to read those stupid comments and I, you know, people who write comments to blogs and who go into chat rooms and message rooms, all of this stuff, those people are the ones that need to be locked away far from the rest of us. Because they are really, I have no life. Tragic, best bread. Except of course, if they happen to be friends of ours. You know what I'm saying? Right. Well, like for example, like him. Now, I, in fact, I'm quite proud of him for putting that on there about 400 times the Shaw's stupid, the whole thing that wasn't the first place that comments. You have comment on my ass. But as, is that Christiana Mampur, who says the words that is asked you and a wreck is a nightmare? And what they're what are we doing there? I always hated her like, boys, but I'm saying, look, look at that. She's wearing wooded shade. Look at that. She's saying, maybe changing the tool. Not going to be back on again. I'll look at all the getks. They've got nice oranges over there, though. There she is. She's sitting on the floor on it flying carpet. Look at like a real getky with a green schmoth on her head. She got that 400 year old Iraqi guy says, oh, hey, what are you doing? Here, I'll ready to go away. By the way, I got a thugster from Canada. Try to email him his hands again. Once the other website. And I tried to email him in my email got bounced. So there you go, Ken. Well, what do you mean email got bounced? He wants to know our website? No, no, the website where he can go and vote. Oh, the money here. Well, let me tell you right now. Just go to mamihero.com and on the front page on the internet. About two thirds of the way down on the bottom right hand side. You'll see blogs. And it's a day very blog on here, which nobody would read that. And none of that is red coat. And what does it call? What does he call it like a retardo evidence of random evidence? Random evidence blogbos. And he click on that baby. And then he's got a thing there, a song to dance. And then one more really concentrate. Now you can certainly vote for Mad Dog or Hank or whoever. But the one more really concentrating on. Because they like, they just loaded it up. Thanks to this funny email. You know, Ken, all their executives, and all their pons, and the janitor, and all their kids. That's actually not understand. They were circulating that all the schools. You know, most of the kids have got computers now. And they were circulating in the schools with instructions where to click. Let's see. What is this now? Tafscan. What is one of the three pages that I sent you. The other two pages are the numbers that they wrote on there. So you only need that one. Now who's this from? I'll read the top there. Stop playing in the hurricanes. What does that mean? I obviously it's from that other station or something. Or somebody in the hurricanes. For your loudspeaker. For your loudspeaker. Or you've been five years in spring. Or this is from across the street. Oh, your TSL went down and you're turnover. Yeah, you know something we still had a 607 or an amount of day when they were there. One nine. How do you like that? Apple sweet heart. See, I got the monthly's already. You give me a big son of dance. Yeah. For all five six and in November we had a three six. To stop. Oh, I see. I thought we're talking about the team. Stop playing in the hurricane my ass. And did not actually go on here. See, I don't play games with the numbers. Did I say that they might have been as well off the year and they were during some of November. Did I say that? When he had zero point. Oh, oh, oh, whatever. I said that. But no. This is from Rosen and Rosen PA. Who must be somebody's boyfriend over there. Send me a bunch of crap. Like, this is supposed to prove something to me. And this writing looks awfully familiar to me. Looks awfully awfully familiar. I don't know. Well, what's that? Brower number on there and the upper, uh, How must be Rosen Rosen PA? I wouldn't have that. They're, they're, well, guess what? You mama's so softness business about your TSA as the big deal. TSA, of course, you went down because everybody's trying to put their life back together again. You idiots. Yeah, you think I got one month they're claimed to fame there. Just like last April. Oh, we're going to kick their ass 18 to the 34. You guys think that you can like talk talk yourself into it. It ain't going to happen. How many years have I been saying that now? Talk yourself into having big numbers. Either you got them or you don't. And you guys don't. You had a couple of bogus months there. Very suspect. And anybody that's going to use the fall book as evidence of anything is going to be a lunatic. That would be like us saying, well, look at November. They had a, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, yeah, so big deal. I might as well have been off the year. Could I have a listen to them when they're trying to save their life from the hurricane. Or find water where all of these things, huh? In fact, quite frankly, we didn't do all that bad in November compared to what it could have been. Who the hell was getting dire reason? Who's getting any mail? Who was sending out an email? Most most people had bigger fish to fry. Okay. See you didn't try to talk yourself into where like, eh, like, not this fast. Look at the tone of it. You're like, the slapping in the old geez. Oh, I'm not going to recover from that. Yeah, mama. Okay. You guys aren't fool us. I got a six point eight, which, you know, and all that great. We had a seven-sum in October. And they had a one-nine. Is that close? Is that something a contest to you? Hey, stop taking the police. In sandals on their day, and we'd day along with Moses and Abraham's Solomon, they still don't get to do a number. So, quick give me a shout-out answer about your T. I said, well, what'd I have up yours? That must be from Alan Bukhi Brown. And by the way, I got wrote on this code, wrote in a good at kick your ass. 33. Oh, this is what they're upset about. Yeah. They're crying over there because now we got 3367 votes from our fine lawyer audience. And they got 2646. We're only like almost there. We're 721 votes ahead. How do you like that? All right. If they've already exhausted the whole audience and all their relatives and all the employees and the janitors in laws, that's it. You lose. That's it. For them to be given me a written lecture about ratings. Oh, my God. You know something seriously? That would be like parents giving a seminar on programming. You know, you follow what I'm saying? What do you say? It would be just the most locomotion. Be like Greg Leigh being a radio consultant. 1242 at 560, WDQM would be a live near downtown for a Saturday or not. I want to tell you about a fabulous restaurant that's worth the drive anywhere in South Florida. First take in lobster house. You'll find on the 17th week. Clauseway. You'll find terror. She'll be there. Almost in the agreed and guests at her new 200th restaurant at Lounge. Probably bringing East Coast residents to the same fantastic terror dining experience that earns her Markle Island restaurant near perfect marks and that most important is a Gatsurve. And also a one spectator ward. Excellent. Winelist. Now, boasting over 381 selections from the world's greatest wine regions. The main attraction. No. Terror. Stake in lobster house. They can store川 they. They can store them. The main attraction. Stay left. There's someone to mix the water with, a misair.olly force. The cheese. There's someone to mixed together. Heones. There's a Fox. Heones. The launchers have prepared steam, world-stepped, cramping, whatever you like, or with a filet for the ultimate surf and turf. And now being stone crab season terror are quickly becoming the stone crab house, too. No need to fight traffic to mind me to get those jumbo sweeties, but make sure to reserve an advance because they go mighty fast. Don't miss Tara's happy hour if he Monday through Friday with two-for-one special de-drinks, or their complimentary wine tasting every Thursday from 530 to 730 when he stayed for dinner. Tara's taken a lobster house at 1430, southeast 17-speed causeway in Fort Lauderdale, in Colton Lake Reservations at 9504, 765-6202. That's 9504, 765-6202, or visit their website at terroristadecousem. Let me say it again, a little confusing here. Terrorstick and lobster house.com is all on word of course. Terrorstick and lobster house.com and don't forget when a subject is great steak, everybody will be raving about terrorists. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5162Face. By the way, I'd rather have a long day. I'm going to scream at my mouth. Tara's great. Oh, he's taking it. He's taking it. Or he's taking it. Or he's taking it. He's taking it. And the more the altitude that's the altitude that's the altitude that's the altitude that's the distance from the 12-day altars, the more far the more beautiful they go, and Brazil. And there's Lenny Pipe-a-Rou działant, and there's this game called generalaina, anti-D methane poses. In exc�로 I made suit. Oh, in Linej noise, there's this design. They're playing excess air on the Nectrorquist, D Deb. But left side behind. Personally, what's the most important point for today? Well 47, they got a 3-5 and he's similar to Paulinger as profusely because I actually wed dug in because I like to get it right, I don't just line making numbers up. We had a 6-8 in December, they had a 3-5 to knit 2. You'll never hit that number again. And by the way, they're like the listenership, and way down from November to December. Way, way down. Although they were average quarter hour went from a 0.3 to a 3-5. And I told where we had a 7-4, they had a 1-4. That's pretty tight in it. Hey, stop blaming the hurt. In November, we had a 3.1 in midday because of the hurricane and it's not blaming any man. They had a 0.3. Maybe they'd like to say that was an accurate number. Okay? We'll be more than happy to give you full credit for that. Brown and Brown and Rosen and Rosen and whoever you folks are. And Zola, fine-berg. And then December 6-8 to 3-5. They'll never see that number again. If they lived to be 50,000 years, just as bogus is last April. You know, places like that, they get a few fire diaries. Sprets it when we turn on. And let me say it again. November and December, much more thrown down the toilet. When you think that would be a high priority and most people's agenda is filling out radio diaries all the time. Or maybe they're like trying to put the roof back under how it's good be. But what do we know about you? Give me a give me a lecture on ratings, man. You guys are kicking our ass. We're going to have 3471 for us in 2016, 60 for it. Let's go to show you what about your winers there. Some schmuck sends me a fax. Give me a lecture about your Blankhol listenership when, ah, yeah. Like I said, probably most living and breathing people are out there trying to put their life back together again. And by the way, what was our like to listen to ship again? Yeah, that's going to be. Oh, and he said, what's on was it? It was six hours. There's with five hours. Himala. Big deal. Never less. Yeah, here's another ratings may of an old Joel, fineberg sitting there. What are we going to do? They're kicking our ass on that pool and Rogers. Got them all with the eagle sea. You'll see. In fact, I got news for you, man. Joel, fineberg, and Alan T. Brown. And who's the element over there? Because if we beat you in this pool since you're so whipped up about it, you all, all you guys should retire. When you think, right, whip your ass, retire. Or, because we gave you the big handy, can't because our guys are like me in line. Okay, so I'm going to bat for everybody else. Which of the big two stations do you prefer for sports radio get Greg Cody a very important blog in the world? A million important thing. Everybody's life depends on him, I guess, according to the way they're responding. We got 26,65, the losers, and we got 35,22. We're like pull up to 1,000 votes ahead. And that's why they're rattling their spirits and sending his faxes with numbers in your, yeah, I got news for you. When a bunch of amateurists are sending me song and advance about ratings in South Florida, that's got to be one of the most important news in things I've ever heard. That would be like guilty giving me a seminar on voice lessons. Like, we did cause big, give me a seducation lesson. See how big I've been electrocution lessons at pitch. Anyway, what do I get whipped up on? I don't know. Just kind of, so silly, you know, so obvious, so transparent that they're looking their wounds now, now that the king came on a year and kicked their ass today. Put them back where they belong down and down in the sewer. Somebody, Q.A.M. Hello. Hey, me, I know a money. All right, pal. Two things, man. I don't know how you do it. You got so much patience. I mean, for two years you were doing screen risk. I would be going crazy when these people caught up in it. Yeah, it could be two years after a lot longer than that, I think. Yeah, longer. And it can be called. Can I see something you're wrong as with? Yeah. Let me know. What do you say? That's the joy to audience. You have people being as stupid as they possibly can. That's what makes it so interesting. And that's why that's why we're publicly going in the state. That's right. Listen, for a whole, you know, you were talking about mo. How does that sport to guys that ever left Q and a.m. You like the mo. Who you missed the mo. So he didn't know that would be Joe Rose. Yeah, I don't go away. But he thought it'd be a concept. Yeah, I mean, he told me. I mean, I'm going to say how much you pay to make that call. Default talk about corn. Even our general man, he said to me, he said, boy, even though I would, they don't go to go to the corn act. We don't want to default. OK, old and worn out rehashed. Like old, soggy remashed taters. I'm saying. What do you say? I would wish there were time taken to play. There would be like taking a poll. What did you think of this? Yeah. Oh, they would agree on that. Are you eating again? I'm eating now. The food just showed up. From where? Tony's. I'm having a night. Oh, right. Thank you, Brad. There's a good guy, man. Doesn't bug anybody. You know, I encountered Brad. I was wrapped my beautiful vet on the, by the stadium there. Go to work one day. Maybe I was going home. And I was a pain the tool. And I, do you pay the tool going out? Yeah, I guess you do. And he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he's Brad from telling me. He's, uh, thanked him profusely. And he didn't even bug me or anything like, hey, pull over. I have a big chat for half an hour. You know, good guy. Doesn't come in here like, try to monopolize the whole place. Speaking of a vet, I, uh, I drove a buddy of mine's dad's vet. Now, do you have the, uh, the sweet little hologram that shows like the, the spedometer on your window? The hood. The front. Yeah, because that, they've had that for long things. I'm going to call the hologram. It's called a, what's on the neck? I call it display a hood. Yeah, yeah, heads up display. Well, anybody, yeah. That's up. Yeah, right. That's it. Oh, yeah, the display several model. I think since 2004, we've had that. Or three, even. Now, what year, what, what, what, what, what was this you were driving? This is a brand new one. Oh, the brand new one, 2006? Yeah, he, we saw, I was, I got that 2005 with the keyless entry in the whole deal. Mm-hmm. Right? Well, this one's keyless too. Well, I would think so. I mean, if it's a 2006, why would they go back to stick in the key in the dough? I mean, it's kind of like, or even cooking that button? Now, do you open your doors too by the push of the button? You don't have to push any button. As long as you, as long as you have to get a pocket. The approach. As long as you have that maybe in your pocket, the pocket rocket, it opens. And now you get in there and you put your foot on a break and you hit the button and it starts to start. So I'm talking about for your door. How to tell you. What did I just get through so far? Okay, and as you were pro, as long as the key is in your pocket, the key to your beautiful corvette or your friends, of course, beautiful corvette, the door will open as you approach. As you get within the door will open and somebody will shoot. No wonder they don't want to give them that raise. So you like it, huh? What's that to like? Exactly. It's like a fast catalach. Am I right? It's a lot better than that. That's not what I'm saying. It's just, I'm talking about the ride. Smooth as can be. See, people think of corvettes and I think like back to the old, like, you know, even the old, uh, 60, 768, which were beautiful cars, but many ran really rough or like your ass dragon on the ground. 35, 99, do you know if I refresh it again? I guarantee you, I'll bet your Robert Creepers life on it. We got at least 3600. 3608. And they got 2681. We're all more closing in on a thousand vote lead. And they're giving me a seminar on ratings and like the list new ship and by the band. You know, you can take numbers and you can make all kinds of chapel liberal, the minute can slice them up and try to prove something by one month. One month or two months doesn't make a career. It doesn't make a lifetime. It doesn't make an audience. It doesn't make something that agencies are real people want to buy. Okay. People want to do a reach an audience. They want to move, spit off the shelf. That's why people advertise. Not because they like sniffing somebody's jacks, threat. They used to play ball at semi-literate. That's not what it's all about. Man, who the hell do you guys kidn over there? See, they really think that they can, they're going to come in like a, elephant in a china shop, you know, and they're going to like force their way through a marketplace. We got that dolphins. We got all a Joel Fineberg, that he's money and Stu got his debt. We're going to, yeah, these are guys who all used to work in a station. Most of them. Mark Eisenberg, he flopped even a midday, even with the juicing toast and omelette. He flopped in midday. Mark Eisenberg, even over nice, you couldn't keep a job. That's the kind of great town they got. Stu got's. Who used to be, you know, just a shrub there. He used to go for there at 2 a.m. Now, he's a general manager. General manager. Totally, and that would be like, parents being our program director. That's our ridiculous studies. What else do they got? Who, who they got the engines, Saladkin? Well, who, who is that kid? You know, Josh? No, this is neither p, I know that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's boog's producer. Yeah. Well, that's boog's buddy, yeah. And the poor booster, man. Hey, everybody. I'm just like a lot of sub-sports here. Come on, man. It's all the fish. I still say he wouldn't take the mess. I mean, he's such a smart. I used to, you know, I mean, not that I dislike him, Randy, but I used to have such high feeling for his future, but he just don't get it, you know. I mean, what is there to like about being stuck at a horseball station? It's got no numbers. It's going to go nowhere. And eventually they'll finally, why won't we, won't be at frequency no more. And, you know, then we're doing like the 6 games here on ESPN. It is about FODY. They're about FODY? Yeah. Well, I was in the best. I actually like him a lot. Good guy. I mean, he said, his only problem is you know what they say about kids getting him with the wrong company? Nope. Him and LeBaster. He hangs out with the wrong crowd. Here's one who says, I do miss them all. They will. The voice of the South Florida mentality. Ha ha ha ha ha. This is beautiful. He says he was a miserable bastard with stab as best friend in the back. And that is if he had one. I never will forget when he called the other sports station and told me, listen to their show. But other than that, he's a pretty nice guy. Where is he now? He's a hot-room-tank off of Dick Stockton. And that's right. Maybe he could have fought fill in some days in his old times. Like, that's not how things have been in the first. I don't think that's in the old made. I wouldn't be surprised. That's going to be next. They're going to have like, we just filled the whole thing I old made turn around TV with the golden, the golden. I wish that that. That's going to be good. Do you have a two? Let's see.

No, I'm done. Are you really? Yeah, I think so. That's what Clarence said He said owner Jeffrey Loryer called him out the way the luncheon and said what are you gonna say? Are you gonna win for them that if they don't get a stadium built the team is gonna leave? Are you gonna win for them that if they don't come to the games the team is gonna leave? Are you gonna win for them the contribution from the team is the fourth largest mystery of baseball in a market that's never proven to be completely baseball friendly I said I probably would not mention those things said David and Delilah Samson's exactly he doesn't understand people saying that stadium we would have gotten done if someone else were in charge I'm thinking to myself is it me is it us is it the concept or Maybe it's just the emotional part of sports and government helping what they perceive to be rich people while Wayne He's pretty rich and John Henry's pretty rich, and they didn't get a stadium What does that mean? Does that make any sense in that kind of like reverse logic?
