Okay, have a safe flight. Thank you. Off for Tulsa, one home. One for our still Tulsa. That's what Henry said. What could happen to him? Oh, you don't want to go there. No. How you doing today? I'm here because you're just sick. Ah. See if George wore out sick. I'd be out sick. I look at the flu. But I got my sugar free sea pickles here all. I'll do stuff. Yeah, they're good though. Oh, yeah. Not really. I take sugar free. Sugar free. Yeah, sugar free. Sugar free. Sugar free. Sugar free. Yeah, sugar free. I think sugar free. But not sea pickles. It's the other brand I came in. Thank you right now. I got to get out of here. How you doing, Nora? You got to see? You have a flu? Well, a little. I've had it for a few days. You know, that's why I had the sore shoulder and the neck and the sore throat. But it'll, you know, it runs this course. It's just though I'm just overmind. So I get to go on an airplane probably catch it back again. Right. And of course, you know, whatever I don't have now, probably catch the Seth Numeunow where. Because we got to Marlins in the Cobb. Oh, yeah. We got a 50 minute early exit. So if you're just like you, I'll be exiting real fast. Right. I'll be able to talk to you tomorrow from Tulsa. Excellent. What it'll be a first. Yes. First crossover in history on his station from Tulsa. Next Tuesday by the way, little 30 in a morning, you want to be sure and be listening. The ratings are going to be coming out. So nobody told me that I had a look it up on the internet. 11 30. 30 30. Huh? Yeah, I'll be around for that. Yeah, you'll be there. I promise, unless you get joyous between now and end. Yeah, why would two of Clark Flight that day for Louisville? Do you hear really? Yeah, maybe I'll stay there. I'm not going on numbers. Wait a minute. Well, what does that mean? What is the, you're going to be doing your shows from Louisville on Wednesday and Thursday? No, I'm not working next. I am working, but I have to draw show next Wednesday and Friday, the Oaks and Colauberg. So who's going to be doing a morning show? Well, we don't know yet. Different people. You aren't going to believe this. It says on the schedule, I'm looking at it today. This is the first time I've seen this. I'm coming to relapse after the Marlon Cove game. It says 220 to 550, which, you know, my not last that long. So let's assume the game ended at five. Yeah. Until ten, he got five hours a goalie? Yeah. The Pandora just your radio spokes. Well, listen, have a safe trip. I don't want to hold you up. I don't have to fly out the door. Hope you feel better. Yeah, well, one of these days. Okay. I have QAM allergies. What it is. Well, you're going to be here until you're 100. That's it. Yeah, the why don't we new you know why I keep renewing that deal? Why not? It's a good deal. But keep the turbo bell his job, you know. All right. Okay. See you in Tulsa. Yeah. I'm happy to be with you. Yeah, great. On my way. Be sure and Friday to stop in Shul. See you. See you. See you. The music stressed on previous programs are those of the host guests. I'm not sure if they're using broadcast groups. It staffs advertise their agencies. For creating a 5 6th week. Don't give me a hit. This is my head. For my day. Roger's got it. You're willing to say goodbye. You're for full. On Christmas of 10 New Year's Eve. I want to show you the ways. And switch your tracks with my green nose. Back up. You're rather slow-fist with now a fooling up my fly. For the season. Dash my hopes of merry please. Here's what'll be my eyes. For no apparent reason. And like most of the years. There's a way to see in my trailer. And then I find you no longer here. You've got a day in my life. I shall sail here. And throw the hearts above those forest waves. And I want those days and days. Now you're no good young. If your toes I've walked in my mouth. I've been half over the shore. Back to like swore for a day. Oh, we've lost my fear. Now only chefs will weaken. Back, back, back, back, back, back to rectum. 10.02.05.60W. You're happy your Wednesday, April 26. Marlon's looked to make it five and 14 today. See, until he yesterday five and 13, you laughed at me. No, I did not. I just corrected you. I was just no longer just going to hit him myself. But that's the one side of those was only three to one yesterday. I correct about that. I didn't see any of it. But I, yeah, you were about to, I don't know. That score. And today could be five and 14. Who picked yesterday? Dr. Oh, that is so in other words, see when they lose one down 12 pitches. That's like a double lane. That's when you know that things are looking really grim because those are the games just post a win. You know, like one out every five. We're still one out of five. This is very good. I'm not going to get you two four. One out of five. Do the math on that is about 34 wins. They'll do a little better than that. Not much, but a little bit. They're five and 13, man. But they're going to play the cups that we've been fielded at. And I'm sure the cups are looking their chops. Marlon's on deck at 145. We've got it at 15 minutes early. None too soon. But how about I couldn't be like a 1145. What'd be good? I mean, I like that idea of going by central time. Yeah. That's right. It's not a fact. It's 11. I know. What do you mean by that? Well, we'll get out of here at 12. We're going to go in a central time starting going to get to be that time. Right. So the game is at 120. It's at 120. But that's your car or time. Always like your car or a lot. Well, you know, that's correct. We had yesterday about the standing roll. He seats on a plane. Yeah. And how do we're going to strap people of the wall or something like that? Which is ridiculous. Yeah. Well, Airbus called it. That's exactly the word they used. The York Times in Florida, the Airbus is quietly pitched to standing where we optioned to Asian carriers, though none of you had agreed to it. But a spokesman for Airbus suddenly did not report yesterday going so far as to call it. How do you like that? I wonder if Joyce heard that, huh? He called it craft, Joyce. How do you like that, honey? Crap. Our passengers and customers want more and more comforts at Barbara Crafts. A spokeswoman for the Europeaner craft maker. We're going to the direction of more comfort, not in that direction. In other words, not strapping people up to the wall. Although I think some of the people I've seen on planes ought to be strapped to the wall. The paper, quoting experts who had said in the seat of proposal reported that if the standing room option is used, Passengers would be, properly against a padded backboard, tell them place with a harness. And whipped heavily by Brad Kramer. To call us, he would be misleading, Volker Melody, a physics professor at Old and Merge University in Germany told the paper. Melody is done research on an airline seat covered in a sea that is on accord of the times report. He could be reached by for comment. The paper said that the use of standing would allow the new A380 double-lecker adjet that air buses in the process of introducing, but hold up to 853 passengers compared to 500 if they were given traditional seats. But they said it's a bunch of crap. Can you imagine, 853 people on a plane all the diseases you can catch on that baby? Yeah, as it is now just in the pad air, the lack of circulation in the craft here on planes. You're probably going to have a scratchy throat and a cold flu. All of these facilities. But boy, 853. But it may have probably, doesn't that mean that 300 people would be strapped? Standing strapped now. Probably they could in the fort for a class if they were a little strapped for cash. But anyway, however I'm definitely not going to be talking for four hours or even three hours and 45. George had some nerve. Did not predict yesterday we would call him sick today. Yeah, I knew he was working up to that right at a time. And I have been sick in about three years anyway. Have missed a single day sick in the days. I think about three years. I don't know about that, but yeah, you know. It's been a long time. Yes. I have many sick days coming. WQAM sick line. Hello. I'm sorry. Hey, you don't mind about me. Okay. I was trying to call you yesterday to tell you about the, the situation they released and the, had the permission to declare there already. I'll go. I thought it was in that line. Oh, brother. There are about 450 bucks. Well, you've heard that. I was going to object to a big shooter like me. I could win that in half an hour, would buy today. I know. All right. So, well, wait a minute. You got one. No, no, no. It's too bright here. I know where. That's a full tank of gas. Correct. Not a whole. Great. Thanks for the info pal. So they're out. You can go with a best buy or worst buy or any of those joints. Would you be picking one up today tomorrow? No, not today. Today I've got to go win the money. We go buy one. That's right. Maybe it'll win 450. I've got to win enough money to buy the HD DVDs. And I can probably buy all of them that are going to be out. I don't know if I haven't seen any of them. I'm not really so sure that those are really in the stories yet. The actual HD DVDs. Yeah. So what is scam? So now you've got to rebuy all your DVDs. Oh, yeah. You've got to see how many I got. I got to get to see into DVDs as you know. Yeah. And I'll go go out like you're setting and rebuy all new ones. Well, I don't think so. The only to movies I really like. Like, kind of think of, trying to think of which one I would really want to have an HD, you know. Like there was one I think called the swimmer. Well, I don't want to go with it that. Well, you see all the, you know, all the definition there. Here's the pull results from yesterday. And we're either going to take a lot of calls. And we're going to play heavy duty triple shot Wednesday. Remember we used to do that thing. I don't think you were on the show. Oh, yeah. All bit Wednesdays. Come on. Oh, not all bit Wednesdays. The one to two hours. We never did all that. We're going to try to get out of here. Boy. Although now that you mentioned it. What an idea. Yeah. Sorry. No, welcome to our new program director, Josh Curtis. We're already got the same first name. And that other one. Oh, brother. The sea's still there. Or is he out of the sea? Oh, yeah. You see here. See you doing you and. Yeah, he piled on the how he's breakfast order this morning. He piled on. George wasn't here. So he figured he would be the first time. We asked yesterday what country represents the world's greatest threat today. I sound like we were like, you know, much more. But it's going to get my. What are these? We're going to say, sirs. A few of the thing away. What are they? I don't know. I got my holes. And the word hurt is my super call. I'm sorry. I haven't had these in years. Remember the original yellow ones probably not before you were born. We still make those. I've always been a holes guy. Yeah, but this I can't eat those. You want to why? Why? I like those too because the papers get you all put up your. Sign as in everything. I like those a lot. Yeah, that's that's good. And it's better in this crap. But the regular halls that loaded with sugar. Well, these are sugar like three. And they will you wait a minute. Okay. And you eat them like candy. So if you have diabetes like how do you blow your. You blow your. You're going to do a scour. And these are supposed to be sugar free by notice last night. Did he's also. Have a negative impact. They send your blood sugar up a little bit. And that's not like what that is. So and then he's also have like. Sobital. But it's the last ingredient. Something I'm just going to squeeze my cheeks. We'll tie it till one forty five. I'm sure you'll have. And the halls sugar free. Sans sucrose. Those have lots of. Sobital or multi-tall or all of these. All of those things. I did not. I mentioned I yesterday. Well, but I'll be squeeze of my cheeks. That I felt a little. No, you don't. I don't think you have that irritable bowel situation. Some was old farts. But man, oh man. I had. I had a whole pack of those. Just like a work candy, you know. Yeah. And I got home just in the nica time. And it was one of those deals where you walked in the door and you ran. You didn't walk. You walked in your door. Probably I think I even left the key in the door. Ran to the magic room. I mean made a beeline. Wow. I was in there a lot. I wanted to put it that way. I wanted to get too graphic. And get Joyce. I'll bet I'll be shapin' all that extra joy activity discussion. That's what I'm gonna love. Excreting a lot. So the halls is the leads me. I have no choices there. Two to the sandwell. I'm sorry. Well, not half as far as I am because these tastes like crap. Is that right? I see people. They're very. They're like medicinal tasting. You know, even the cherry ones that I got here now. Which is a cherry would be, you know, a side of bad flavor. Right? But not good. What country represents the world's greatest wreck today? We had 1788 votes. Quite a few as a matter of fact. Let's see. What are we gonna do? We're gonna do our thousand a day. We might. Because I didn't put this on or till late last night. I forgot about it. Yeah, we'll get without over. Are we five thirty? We got so far. Five hundred and uh. Five thirty men. Five thirty on today's. I got tomorrow's all set. I already got it over there to Eric. So I don't want to tell you what it is here. What country represents the world's greatest wreck today? USA? 780 man. 44% of you said USA. USA. USA. You say right. I'd by the way, a Tony snow is the a new press secretary like that's a bulletin. Fox news. I'm surprised you didn't make it to, what's his name, Bill Araley? Or Sean Hannity. He could just do revolving Fox news anchors. Or Brid Hume. There's another right wing. Jack asked. Iran. He's a 258. North Korea. 181. Saudi Arabia 104. That should be much higher in fact as your phone up your gas tank. Um, curse the Saudis. Do you know how much gas isn't Venezuela? No, I don't. 12 cents a gallon. Is that right? That is correct. 12 cents a gallon of Venezuela. Do you know what taking good care of his own people? I'll have to head down there. Head to a caracas. I hate this. 156. Israel 41. Canada 38 definitely a great threat. We got a lot of nooks. We got Stephen Harper. He's pretty much a threat. Wouldn't let them take photographs of the ceremonies with the foresoldiers. They just brought the bodies back from Afghanistan over the weekend. Picking a page out of the George Bush song book. So they got a right wing extremist here too. So maybe Canada will become dangerous. 38. Probably all that pot now. On facts. Iraq 25. Pakistan 16. And India. I think India is a lot more dangerous than you realize. They're taking all those jobs. That's where they're outsourcing all the jobs. When you get close to the PIN and the S phone calls or solicitation calls. A lot of those are coming from India. Did you know that? Screw them. Exactly. School on you first. You can get by that curry smell. Some of the people from India are very beautiful looking. But when you get closer. Oh man. I think I'll go find somebody else too. Crowd with it. Now they're not all the Indian people have curry smell. I can't believe you said that. What? You've never even met any people from India. But maybe once have you. I can't remember. But now you never met any. We don't have any Indian people in South Florida. Very few. We have Indians. But that's American engines. We're busy. You know what I'm fooling me gambling deals. And all those cancer sticks. Get even with a white man. I still can't believe people. People keep driving or explaining the way those machines work at the Indians. I just. What are you people thinking about? I mean you're all with tough because your friend put in one coin. I got 10 grand or something. Which is. And I still ran on. Yeah, I told you when they have the real slot machines. I'll go play for like 20 minutes. Well, well, what do you got to go into the India? Oh, and I forgot to ask Hank again. All of me forget tomorrow. George, I'm sure George will be out all week. But you'll have to. Lots of coming in. I want to know when those slots are coming in. So I can plan my next trip down. I'm not coming down here unless I can go loose a money. I wouldn't believe a word in the old Senate. The tongue was not arrived. George, hold video 516. WQA, at the free sentence. Dude, God has done it. Hold it. Hold it. Come on. Hey, you silly. Come on. Coming to me on a show today. Now that is a prince of peace. Come on. Come on. Yeah. I don't believe it. It's too close. Come on. Don't let me go. Now I'm going to go. Go up and go down. I don't want to go down. Oh, man. Oh, man. I've got to go. Yeah. I got to go to the top of the day. I got a glass of medicine. Oh, man. The pills. Good thing I'm big and poor. How did you get out of this? Well, they call it all those sick. Who are they? Ma'am. You can see it on their way. We want to see it. Oh. Oh, man. Oh, man. Why are they all over? you are taking fun. Yeah, I'm bigger than you. I watch out for Jackie Wilson. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I can do that. Rosie. I do a good job. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, he was. Anyway, here's the schedule. We got Marlon Zondack coming up 145. And then the Marlon Zondack comes to 20. Back to the volume. We got guilty for hours and hours. And hours till 10 o'clock tonight. But I tell you, this seems to be the new QM format based on the fact that his girlfriends are making out the schedule every day. I could be just, you know, imagine that. But that would say what it looks like to me. We got guilty up the bat. Yeah. Till 10 o'clock any K at the 10. Which I'm sure the audience would be long gone by then. 574 votes on today's full. What best describes most is soft flutter residents. And this is good for people listen to this show. Because they get a real good cross section of soft flutter by listening. Yeah. Rained it. That is the correct answer. 195. Beating all the other hands down your pants. Speaking of hands down your pants, I just started sucking on these sepicals again. Is that right? And I dropped it. Well, I heard the words I was like doing too many things at once. And so I slipped out of my mouth and right down into my box, I assure you. Talk about candy in the crevice. But at any rate, every covered it. Rained it. 195. Illegal's 98. Average 75. Well, what a compliment that is. Average my ass. In saying 58, rejects 52. Losers 35. I see a lot of similarity between those two. Ostroges 33 with their heads very well. That's the good thing when you got a lot of sand like we do in Florida. Have a your head very deep in a 33. And find American's only 28. You'll chew. Only 28. Final Americans at the rest. Brain dead. So what do you expect me to do about it? I'm not going to like a wave of magic wanted. Make miracles or something. Can't do it. Can't do it, pal. As a matter of fact, here's living proof. Here's line nine. Q.A.M. Permanent. Ha ha ha ha. Man, he's moving it around today. Nice going there. Do it. Nice glasses, by the way. Did you ever see him? That's right. You said you've seen him at the Marlon games. Oh yeah. You've seen it. I have. Sorry. That's for a man. The press eyeglasses today. It's always good to have a spare pair with the Coke bottle. You don't cut the bottle out of my Coke bottle. Couple of them. Dolphins running back Ricky Williams lost his appeal of a fourth violation of the NFL Stubborn Division Policy will be suspended for one year. A source told to her last night. That's bad news for the dolphins and bad news for you. If you don't make that deal with sun. Williams was informed by the NFL yesterday. He had a field of violation. They said, go smoke a big fat one. Baby, you're out. You're out. I'm disappointed with the season by respect. Williams said the statement released by the dolphins. I'm proud of my association with the NFL. And look forward to return the dolphins in 2007. Oh yeah. Right. He's got a lifetime contract. Like board Gary did it. I.O.D. Like they want me to have a Q.A.M. Now what do all I see? The reader comments. Look at this. I'm starting to believe the NFL is looking for marijuana over like a hard stuff. This is getting ridiculous. This is not over. Let's take it to the streets. Ricky does not die out of the idea. I'm looking at the comments. I'm he's a story in the hero. Let's have a Ricky ball over it. Okay. No Ricky, uh, Tiki and the streets. Nothing got a change. And he's out. Okay. He is out. Although I would say that the loss of Adam been a turn to the Patriots. His much more devastating than the loss of Ricky Williams to the dolphins. They weren't going anywhere anyhow. Oh, now without Ricky. They can't win that Super Bowl. That's right. They were right on the verge of that Super Bowl. We're smelling the can't just smell it. We're talking Super Bowl because it's the. Oh, yeah. I've been here in that year after year after year. They're at the ball all right. They're at the same bowl that a lot of other teams are at. They're at the toilet bowl. Pukeneur Gusau. Speaking of nice game by a tamper last night. By the way, it's Ottawa losing eight to four right there in Tampa. Nice job. Five six seven eight. Now, either we're going to take a whole lot of calls because I do have somewhat of a pile here, including Molly Ivan. She's got a group column. That column about the ten word. The ten worst corporations in America. It's very, very long. It's on our website. And I, a few thing I'm reading at your dream. I even had my voice. I'm going to be dreaming. I'm doing that VP Delphi. S on mobile. Do bond forward. Haliburton KPMG. Roach Suez and WR Grace. Those are the ten worst corporations. The article was on eight million words. So we didn't weep. Exxon mobile. I think we ought to boycott them. As a matter of fact, Veeville Texas. I don't you love that name. Beville. Beee. Vee. L.A.B. Veeville. Probably home of the killer bees. Texans don't like to be messed with especially in his rugged south Texas County, not far from the some of the states major independence battle fields. So, as early a matter of time before B. County judge Jimmy Martinez, somebody had to stand up to tackle a national epidemic, striking at the heart and pockets of local residents rising gas prices. Oh my God. This week, B. County became the first in the state, possibly in the country. To pass a resolute, asking motorways to boycott fuel pumps beginning next Monday. Just just boycott them. Don't buy gas. Just stay home or walk a lot. It's good for you. Hop on a bicycle. Get you one of them mobile pads. I'll just start walking a work. You get one of them. One of those we talked about in Kavolisio. The things that kids have now they're shoes with the, what do they call them? Oh, they call them out. They got those little, really things. Yeah. Rolling papers. County elected to the police. What are the healy? Healy? That's right. Glenn Healy and Mary Healy and Peter Olin Hayes. The American people are tired Martinez said what we did was simply take action instead of complaining. We're offering our residents a beacon of hope. The hope rhymes with dope. Idiot. To me, the annual income here is about two thirds of the state average of almost 40 grand. Many can't even afford to travel near by hospitals for treatment. They're much less slippers there and they're going to pay this three bucks a gallon for gas. No way. So if you want to protest, head for make a beeline for beville Texas and join the crowd. Join the big protests. That guy to call yesterday. The other guy that called was was correct. That's all over the internet now. That's the new skin. Boy, context on mobile and the ones the other one. There was one other one. I looked at that. And that's going to drive the gas prices down. Right. Right. See all this crap on the internet. You know, the internet's very fascinating, very interesting, but it's loaded with crap. Yeah, I hear buzzer. Load it with crap. 591. I think you're right. I think we got a very positive chance. 592. Look at the way they're coming in here. I can't even keep up with it. We got that thousand with an R site. 593. See, it's done doing a break. I'm just going to keep refreshing it. And as long as it now sees stuck at 593. This is a meal rot. You can't let us avoid it. It's 560. For beautiful. Congratulations. Get a life. Goodbye. The glint. Now you're feeling a challenge. You're put back to Texas. The jumping is all you've got. And crawl back inside your bodies. And you're the debris of us. It's bad. Go out and take with them. You can be your lover, soldier. Man, or as we understand. You prefer a baby, girl, or a faples, rather. I know. I can't say anything. They're the pain, they're the pain. They can't read the game. They can't. A witty truth. For the worst wild out. River, no proof. You didn't go as far as snow. You've got to go home. You've got to go home. You've got to go home. You've got to go home. You've got to go, soldier. You're a rocky chair. Like a man of meaning this flesh. That's the popular one. It was the son of sunglasses. And his nice red shoes. He's a real fashion plate. This is Nazi Pope. The Pope, with the two hunters. He's on Iran. CNN about the Pope being a fashion plate. He's wearing designer sunglasses. People are dying. And this is people by the thousands. And they're worried about the Pope. And they're worried about the Pope and the What kind of glass some vesties were. You are crazy is what you are. But nevertheless, six hundred and seventeen of Ots on the pool. I think you're right. I think we got that thousand. Look, even with the early exit today. You know, like about 10. 45. That's right. Okay. I was going to take this never fails. Any day when you feel like. Done warmed over and where it. Where it. How's the phone action here, huh? Even the crazy people are on. I'm there yet. 5. 6. Huh? Not yet. 5. 5. 6. 5. 5. 6. 5. 5. 6. diving. 5. 9. 5. 5. 6. 5. 5. 9. 9. They have to be paying us to carry those games. That's the part of this whole deal. Let's pathetic. Instead of paying losing all that losing Zidin's dollars on the Marlins, they have to be paying us by the inning to carry that crap. David, I hate to break the news to you. Nobody cares about your Marlins. Nobody cares. And then of course, you know, then they hype it up. They give away some stupid ass bottle of head doll. And if a serious one thing about South Florida, even if it's an event they don't care about, like a hockey game. They'll all show up if they're given something away free. Bunch of shnores. I shouldn't put that on the pole tool where you couldn't spell it. It's all about the giveaway that's got money. That's right. That is absolutely correct. What can we get for free? Even though even though we're going to put it in a drawer somewhere in a broomcloth, it never looked at it again. Oh, what can we have for free? Might be worth something someday, but don't bet on it. Come in and QA in. Hello. Not even there. Line one. QA in. Hello. See. Now when I said, chronically, I wouldn't talk about desperate. We're not, we're not that, we'll never be that desperate. Is he pathetic or what? Is there any words to describe him? Beyond. Yeah. A million miles beyond it. I'm the Chamba guy. I have no life. That's the translation of that. QA in. Hello. Here's some of the intellectual codes. I can smell it. QA in. I need all to find a safe. Thank you for all these years of entertainment. Uh-huh. I want nothing free. Don't worry. Don't miss. Thank you. Okay. You're welcome. Now there is a call. Is that a call? Is that a guy with a thought in his mind? That's why brain dead is winning our pool today and believe you me. That's what I voted for. When I created that pool, I said, man, stuff. If this doesn't win, and these people are, I'm dying in your line. Or is it the other way around? Full of it. Brain dead. I know. I would have also pulled off their choice on there. That would have been the perfect choice. But I don't know how to spell it. It's called. But I like that. I don't know how you spell it. Yeah. Yeah. WQA and hello. QA. How are you doing today? Okay, sir. You too, George. George ain't there. Oh, he's got their say. Ah, she's there. No, George. Ah, hi, Josh. I just checked your website. You know, if you read that thing about the corporations, I could take your ed to the Marlins game. Yeah, that's true. If I had to play a five more voice, I got it in my pile here. It's about 800 pages. I know. I'm packing my bags. I'm heading to San Diego for a few days. Good choice. I'm going to tell you how to spell it. I'm going to tell you how to spell it. Right. But unfortunately, I have to come back to South Florida. Oh, well, but we can drink some day. My dream is to go back to Connecticut now. Connecticut. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think it could come. That's just a lot of an eye. I don't think too much of it. I've been there. I'm not too crazy. The only good thing about Connecticut is close to New York. And I don't really want to go to New York. Whenever I go back to New York, Canada, or anywhere in New England, I wish you like him home. Yeah. I want to think about Connecticut. It's close to Boston. I want to think about Boston. I want to think about Boston. Okay. Well, let's say I have a safe trip. I'm going to take care. Say how the Padres out there. Oh, the road tool. I've never been to San Diego. Everybody raves about the weather there. But they say, I don't know. I'm like, I'm always fearing a naval attack. A lot of semen. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I've got a lot of white wingers there too. It's not that far from. Well, it's, you know, when you get something LA, it gets more and more white wing. Now, let me ask you about Boston. You've been there, obviously. I lived there. Oh, wow. Great city. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Because I've heard mixed things. I've heard people that love it. And then I've heard people say, well, if you don't go to a redstock's game, there's nothing to do. Oh, give me a break. Yeah. I will say this is pretty, um, that whole business about banded Boston. I don't even know if they have any like a even one strip club open anymore. They pretty much, they've gone from one extreme to the other. They used to have an area, which is part of Chinatown called the combat zone. Right. Where they had all the porno when they had like all the strip clubs and all the perversion and then of course just like Julianne in New York face sanitizing, close everything down. And so now Chinatown is, I don't know what it is. They've been there quite a while. I mean, once they close the porno down, what do I want to go there for? But, uh, that's still a great food. Great people. A lot of young people because there's all the colleges, universities, and all kinds of crap there. It's, it's okay. If you can't find something, something that's something that's somebody to do in Boston, man, you've got really, really need help. You need assistance. It's fine. I mean, it's not Miami, but then again, what is? WQA in, hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir, when was this? That's it that you played with Lenny and Goldie? Yeah.

This Saturday's starting to get today and presented by Heinrichen. And you're not going to be playing at Heinrichen. I will be going to have that drop in here. Well, I don't know if it's in mine or not. In fact, I'm amazed at it. I don't know where the hell I damn thing came from that George Vitt. I never played that before. Well, that's from the movie Blue Velvet. Not I mean that, but I mean where it came from in my DCS. I've never played that before. I definitely don't have that. Heinrichen. What would you see get some of this crap? How come he's got all the good stuff? And I got like, he put it that. Like that. Yeah, like how about all those mold drops he was going to put on a distance in me. Remember like, that is correct. All those other, he got a whole bunch of those. When he gets back with his answer to shit. Now that you got that new deal. That's for a guy's courtist, by the way, is the new assistant program director, which means that about six months will be the general manager. Could only be an improvement. Molly Ivins writes, pro is real nut jobs on the attack. I like Molly Ivins. What are they consistent to formities in American policy? The debate has been challenged by a couple of professors and the reaction proves their points so neatly that it's almost funny. We've had a series of stories on these guys. A working paper by John Mirchheimer, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, when Steven Walt, professor of international affairs at the Kennedy School of German and Harvard, calls the Israelabi. The call the Israelabi was print that was the name of the paper. It was printed in the London Review of Books earlier this month. It all held broke loose in the more setable reaches of journalism and academia. For having the Schuere front of me to point out the painfully obvious that there isn't Israelabi in the US, Mirchheimer and Walt have been accused of being anti-Semitic, nutty and guilty of cookie academic work. Alan Dushuitz who seems to be easily upset would totally ballistic over the mild academic compass of just pretty boring article by Mirchheimer, Walt calling them liars and bigots. Of course, there isn't Israeli lobby in America. It's leading a working group as called the Immercan Israel Public Affairs Committee, A pack. It calls itself America's Pro-Israelabi and attempts to influence US legislation in policy. Several national Jewish organizations lobby from time to time, big deal. Why is anybody pretending this non-new is required to fall down the floor and howling? Because of this weird deformity of debate. In the US, we don't have full-thruited, full-thruited debate about Israel. In Israel, they have it as a matter of course, but the truth is that the accusation of anti-Semiticism is far too often raised in misconduct against anyone who criticizes the government of Israel. Being pro-Israel is no defences I learned long, time ago to my cost. Now I've gotten used to it. Jews who criticizes Israel are charmingly labeled self-hating Jews. Is I often pointed out that must mean there are a lot of self-hating news railings because those folks raise hell over their own government's policies all the time. I don't know that I ever felt intimidated by the need jerk your anti-Semitic charge level that anyone who criticizes Israel, but I do know I've certainly heard it often enough to become really tired of it. Now wonder if that doesn't produce the same result, giving up on the discussion. It's the sheer discreforcement and the view of the denunciations of those perceived as criticizing Israel. Let me see a tax-o-odious. Mirishheimer and Walt are both widely respected political scientists, comparing their writing to the protocols of the elders of Zion is just silly. Several critics have pointed out some flaws in the Mirishheimer wallpaper, including a two-brot use of the term Israel-Labby. Those of us who are pro-Israel differently and having perhaps overemphasized the quality of Israel-Labby by ignoring the energy-Labby. It seems to me to be the root of the difficulties, but Israel's inability first to admit the Palestinians have been treated unfairly and second to figure out what to do about it. Now here goes a big fact generalization, but I think many Jews are so accustomed by reality to thinking of themselves as victims, it's especially difficult for them to admit they've victimized anybody else. But the Mirishheimer wallpaper isn't about the basic conflict, but rather it's effect on American foreign policy, and it appears to me the author's arguments are un-receptional. Israel is the number one recipient of American foreign aid, and seems an easy case can be made that the US has subjugated its own interest to those of Israel in the past. What do you agree or not? It's at a scale of well worth having, and one that shouldn't be shut down before it can start by unfair accusations of anti-Semitism. In a very equal sense, none of us is academic. Israel, lobby, was overwhelmingly in favor of starting the war with Iraq, and is now among leading hawks on Iran. To the extent that our interests do differ from those of Israel, the matter needs to be discussed calmly and fairly. This isn't about conspiracies or plots or fantasies or anti-Semitism. It's about rational discussion over a coninterest, and in my case being pro-Israel. I'm looking forward to hearing from all you nut jobs again, she says, I'm sure she will. Just like every now and then, well, well, you're a self-hating Jew, alright. Whatever you say, go to Israel, and we'll pack you a salami sandwich, I'd be like that, with mayonnaise on it. Six hundred sixty two votes, Josh was right, you called it, we're going to hit that thousand easy today. It's probably because George is home sick. I'm home sick. See, that's the one good thing about doing the show here is I can be home sick and still do the show. You trooper you, yeah, what a piece of crap. As soon as I walked in here this morning, I saw the view was pumping, I said to myself, that little spick. I didn't call yesterday, you called it. I can always tell when he's like, ah, gee, you know, what I was a kid, I used to do that. You're right, Lee and Vid and then morning, if I don't want to go to school, I'm a little bit, oh, I'm lonely and growing when I was dying, you know, of course my mother being a real fool. Oh, take the thermometer, put it on the light bulb for a little bit. Oh, no, once in a while she put it back down, yeah. And then I got right up from Randa School. What best described notes is sound flow to residents? 665 old, a bedfiber refresher we got maybe 666, would not be something. Let me just refresh real fast. So, ah, 667 we hopped over it. Brained dead 231, although we have had some very good intellectual call so far. Elegal's 166 average, just come see come saw. Men's a men's a 86. In saying 69, reject 61, losers 42, ostriches 40, and find Americans only 32. And people are going to say, we didn't put very many positive choices on there. Well, what did I leave out? Huh? I think it's pretty accurate. Yeah, I think average would be like a high compliment and that's saying in third place right now. average would be like really, really a reach. WQA and hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes sir. Two things, first off, I got religion. I don't need to watch fair and I had none of that. And all I need to know with loose change part 2 off of your site. Okay. What's the crap going on in here? And the record. Well, the record. That's what they said. The air must man. It's all a bunch of crap. Right. Exactly. And so I like to think that crap because it gets your own subset. All right. And then closing if you're taking suggestions for the poll, what about A-hole? Oh yeah. That I like that. Let's get that right on there. All right. Thanks, pal. You can't say it, but we can sure put it on the, we put a lot of things on our poll that we can't say. I have to like dance around it like he just said it. But just spell it right out. You know, don't put just A, you know. Don't worry. Ha ha ha ha. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that Dennis Lurriesome comes up sometime on the show today. Well, you talk about having a busy affair. Oh, there it is. Well, I wonder what that's called. I think it's called. A-hole. Yeah. Folks. There's much easier here in it. Five, six, what? And to think that we used to play that on here all the time. I remember he holds on parade. I wonder if I can play like, oh, just a little tiny touch of that too here. Yeah, good choice, all of. Oh, here we go. I forget exactly how this, how this goes. I'll send her somewhere. All right. And if that doesn't get him all whipped up, I got a way to do it. If that doesn't make up these bastards in the back room here, they say hello, Mr. Tap. So, wow, I'm not feeling all that great today. And in the fact, that's a good way to get to rest of the week off, I think. Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty. Oh, it's just so silly. The whole thing is just, it's silly, isn't it? Correct, word, it's, it's pathetic is what it is. Just absolutely pathetic. And so, guy comes in here yesterday, Clara Bell. Yeah, I mean, I have no support. None. Absolutely none. It's always the same excuse from him. Oh, gee. We're so scared. Yeah, we know you're scared. I still say the best thing they could do is we do that billboard campaign, even though Domestika Lele might get all better on the shape again. And instead of the original one, just say, two AM, we have no balls. And then I pacify her, as opposed to say, we have balls. I mean, what kind of a silly old-dike it's upset because of a billboard campaign. This is WQM, we've got balls. Every sports station in North American, including the fan here in Toronto, for a long time now, they've had that campaign because of the fan. Whatever it is on the bow, we've got balls. Big deal. Well, people don't get offended as easily in Canada. Is that what it is? That's what it is. Maybe that's because Canada's such a tremendous threat. I think that's Stephen Harper in there. Oh, hey, they're going to rule the day, man. They're already ruling it. WQM, hello. Yeah, I'm here. There we go. Dude, they just keep trying, man. Let's see if you do it like 100 times. Will it go on? No. But you just keep, you keep busy. It'll keep you off the streets. Keep you out of invading your neighbor's house. Somebody QA, hello. Hello. How are you? I'm good. Good. I'm going to question. Why is Tony Snow committing careers suicide by going to be a folksman for probably? What do you mean by that? He's not doing anything different. He's being a mouthpiece for Bush, which he's been doing on Fox for years now. Anyway, so they're not, you know, they're just calling it something different. Yeah, but does he realize that Bush is probably going to have a sort of a worse presence ever? And you know, it'll just kill us for air. No, it'll only make it because no, it won't because once Bush gets in peach, or whatever's going to happen, he'll wind up going back to Fox News. They'll gladly welcome back with open arms and legs and put him on the ear again. Boy, we're right when a fanatic. You have no shortage of your places. I know to see an end is putting Glenn back on the ear now on the weekend. Every right wing nut job that's been on radio or TV. All of a sudden is on the ear. Talk and hit that work now.

Oh, yeah, come on up and club some baby seals to bed. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound five, 60 on a Verizon and the singular wireless line. See the reason they do that is they don't want to like appear to be too civilized. Oh, Carl Roe, meeting with attorneys on his role in the CIA leak matter. Oh, look at that. Is that roving maniac? I'm going to say it again. All this stuff that's going on and you're paying like, and this summer, maybe close to four bucks, maybe open for over four bucks a gallon for gas. I wouldn't be to America. I'm talking to his getting raped and pillaged and looted. People are innocent. People are done. We've got like, mayhem and lunacy every couple of days we get a new video tape from some of one of the master terrorists or an audio tape. And in the meantime, it's like, hey, how's that American idol coming? How's time and how feel this week about this idiot? That's stuff. I, you know, I'll always cliche as my sheet and the world we live in life is a cliche. It'll like after the Holocaust never again. It was all these people in Africa and Darfur and other places. And it's like crazy. And now finally, by the way, finally the Pope the other day they're going to act, they're commissioning a study to see maybe possibly by allowing the use of condoms as a way to prevent the spread of AIDS, especially in Africa. The greatest cause of misery and suffering and death in the world today, the Catholic Church is fine. They finally got around to apologize and we got a layover and finally saying, oh yeah, maybe condoms are okay, but only for the priest. This is real Rogers. This is 5.16.

It's just absolutely beautiful. It's going to be around 60 years today. Good day to go out and plunge your guts out. This drug mom Britney Spears. Here's the important news. Okay. Forget about her rack and forget about the price of gazz and all all is crap. Then people. Pollution. Forget about all the minor things that are going on. Another we have to re-keep. We have to read him story. See, you'll see you'll down. That's right. This drug mom Britney Spears is fired her nanny. Britney Spears, who of course had that little cameo there in Fahrenheit 9-11. Or she said, she believes we ought to do everything the president says. He trust our president. Oh god. Goes to show you that looking good don't mean there's anything between the ears. And of course, who really cares when he can write down to it. But yeah, good point. It's not what between the ears that counts is what's between the, oh can't say that you're a son, sorry. Can't say legs. The singer way that decision to get rid of the little old Sean Preston's keeper in the wake of the child falling from his high chair. She's got some issues. You're running mama Britney. She's not she's rivaling the kid in the, for an holding the kid behind a steering wheel. Like a dog, you know, that's why he's to do it with timing. No, seriously. When I take him to the vet, you'd have to like hold it in and he would want to steer the animal steering wheel. He wouldn't you take the passenger seat? No, no. You can then hyper little little dogs in case you have an odyssterevery hyper. Now my golden retriever, he would like to get in the back and he would just hang on. I went with that. Uh huh. On the vet. Yeah. Yeah. We're getting the back and just pop himself up in there and that would be it. No problem. But the little dog. Yeah. That's how little dogs are. Good thing that he's dead. Anyway, Britney's been hiding out in depressants who are sons headbunking and sitting in cancel plants to celebrate a rather brand's birthday, the magazine in touch weekly says, well that's one of my favorites. Touch it weekly. She wanted to be a mother and touchy could snap her fingers and be the perfect mom, a pal told the mag. Always a pal. You know, that all these articles like any inquire, a pal says, but Britney is leaning the heart learning the heart with a big good mother, something to work out and guess what she's reported to be pregnant again. She's usually not wasting no time is she. Great. She'll have she'll be driving with one on in the wheel and one on the passenger seat. One on the wheel and one on the probably one on the roof. Britney also reportedly heard a doctor device her and how to keep her taught safe. Well, if she's a real mother, she had a higher doctor than teacher had a like do a little mothering. The doctor advised you not to leave press down any high surfaces where you could roll off. Like don't set them up on top of the refrigerator. Which they also say spares were so impressed with the stage advice that she wanted to have the doctor full time, but he told her that wasn't necessary. Maybe he could be the mother. But apparently, child care is putting additional pressure on her marriage to a spiring rapper, how they Kevin Feeder line. The two guided to a spad over whether to go to his hip hop show with a Vegas club Pure last week. Kevin wanted Britain to stay out that night, but she refused. She wanted to stay at the hotel with the baby because she fell on comfortable leaving him with a manny with friend pressure. So, Brits spent that night in the hotel room while Kevin partied. At her sighting, I'm kind of news that America's just dying for man. They're tugs and down their kneecaps for it. I was waiting for you to read that story. Oh yeah. Britney and her new baby.

Or maybe he always winning more tests. W. W. Q. I am. Yes, sir. What do you think about Tony? So. What do you think about him? I think he's a... How do you think about him? Yeah, but it be fettable, but it's right. Yeah, that's exactly what I think. But it be fettable. Go about Tony. Like his real bullet. And it's like, like we hear those press conferences on this stage. Never, every time they're announcing a sports thing like the Pat Riley deal. We know two days in advance that he was going to be the coach again. And right away, oh, well, we better care that press conference. All the time they pull that crap. Like when one stack got canned, remember that one? Oh, how good I forget. They were all over that like stink on Joyce man. Well, the best part is is, you know, they don't let you plenty drops during the press conference. Yeah, because that would be certainly to want to do that. Because that would pollute the integrity of our sports establishment here on QA. You know, we don't want that old bag playing about to nasty like that in there. Or God forbid like any, uh, sound effects while something importants go on. The exception of that was because we don't really care about hockey even though we have the panther franchise. We just assumed you're rid of it. But I remember when Bill Tory had that press conference where he announced he was firing BM and the TM and everybody else. Remember that one? Not really. Well, they let me, uh, they actually let me drop into his stuff on there. Just to piss them off that much more. Boy, those guys are there. And the BM by the way, notice his team one last night, not doing the Jock Marten roll up the, uh, like an accordion of playoffs yet and die like Jack Martin did in Ottawa or beer. Of course, like I said, the Jock Martin doesn't have to worry about his team choking into playoffs this year because the panthers are in the playoffs. Just like to make the leaves, not into playoffs. But that's good to be, uh, you know, kind of a yearly thing. And guess what we got into the mail yesterday again. Oh, we're doing a bill. We already paid the first installment. Plus the playoff ticket money they wanted. Which aren't any playoffs, which supposedly goes to our next year. Now another thing for two or three grand they want for the next season. So it's like the 25th of April, yesterday and they still want more money for the next year. Hey, Alan Cohen, guess what? I know your brother Marty and all I can see you is, uh, you're fair. That's a crap. Man, they just want money and a lot money. And I put in a product out there to like make the playoffs or really put anything out standing on it. Plus new and I can Robert's going to be 90 next year. The two of them. What are they going to do then? Joe, new and I can. Joe, new and I very good. There's there's Josh's thing is talking now. You know, there's what about Robert's. Robert's first name. Bill, Dave, who's with the G? Great. No. Gary, very excellent. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha. This man knows his hockey crap. That idea. This is well as anybody else in South Florida. See, that would be a good. I don't know whether I should do a poll on there, just discuss it. What sports franchise least deserves to exist? Like, for example, Kansas City Royals. For Kansas City is such a non-descript place anyway. You know what, though, for baseball, I mean, what are they one year for games? I'll hold their right on their right on the Marlins ass. Yeah, they are, but Marlins have no bit. Even though, you know, the funny part of it is Marlins of one two world championships, and yet they really have no reason to exist. Yeah. I would know. Although, although I have a hundred times, no reason to exist in the Panthers. Well, the devil raised for baseball, or yes, absolutely correct. There's just no business for the. There is no business like slow business, and that's what they got real slow business. The Tampa Bay devil raised. They got a devil at the time, winning in. And they got a bunch of red next over there on a West Coast who made a big Simis about the one that changed the name of the team because devil raised implies devil worship and, you know, why don't we just put six, six and a back of very players uniform. That would be good. I'd like to see that. Wouldn't it be good? That would be put on there. Little armband with six, six, six, six. It piss off all those, uh, kids. He's over there. 11 13 a QA.

With way more than. Have all. Did you pay any of our jobs? Have a tell you got people who are not in the 4-Hawayio. And you might have written your salary to come to this floor. It's my imposing physique that keeps my jobs. People are going to buy a meek with I got big mothers. I'm busy swan. I'm liking timbre dating. I have no other work worth acting, but I can save the day people. It's too issuing me a check. No matter how I'm balancing, I sound. Now, all the life that makes and 12 won't. Let me show you how that's worth. What's the thing we do? In Tanya Commandant's piece of the focus. Only other thing that matters most important in life. For it. They won't let talk about Luca or Bombay thing anymore in the body. 4-20. I talk about Facebook, Facebook, Facebook. Wow, what a game. We. What's that? What's that? Yes, Mr. We. Oh, just call me Greg. I'm just a consultant now. Okay, who are they want? I'm going to do an important thing, Terry. And now look, why don't you lean on that call, but. Hmm. So that's who that? Why sure. I'm consulting you. Okay. That's what this very important. Everyone's right. Not that what this game. If we don't find a game in what is right. So they have him on the back of the white thumb quilt. Where men. Which we to see. I don't fly. And they get very, very quiet. I'll tell you a situ. But then they talk about Luca and Swathingdale. Well, I'm going to my pie. Here. Yeah. Huh. Huh. He wanted to do about it. They know that he kicked their ass here. That's what I'm buying. I can tell. Come on. I'm going to the other way through the booth. I can go out. I can go out. I can go out. All right. Nice going. Letty. He demand. Letty Martins. I can't get him and get the other. I think we got a good point. Coming soon. We don't want to get it on that. All here's some good news. Here's some excellent news. Do you want to get it all the way? Or some people say Illinois's because there are a lot of stupid people. California has become a second state in which a proposal and peach president of Bush has been introduced in the state legislature. And this one includes Cheney as well. All right. California Assemblyman Paul Corresse of Los Angeles, where the L.A. times is now called for Cheney's resignation, has submitted amendments to assembly joint resolution number 39, calling for the impeachment of president George W. Bush and vice president Vic Cheney. The amendments for our French section 603 of Jefferson's Manual Rules of the US House of Representatives, which allows federal and people from proceedings to be initiated by a joint resolution of a state legislature. The resolution in the words of Corresse's press release bases the call for impeachment upon the Bush administration intentionally misleading the Congress and the American people regarding the threat from a record order to justify an honest, sorry war that has cost billions of dollars and thousands of lives and casualties, exceeding constitutional authority to wage war by invading Iraq, exceeding constitutional authority by federalizing the national guard. I thought there was no national guard, no right. Concephiring the torture prisoners and violation of the federal torture rack, indicating intent to continue such actions, spying on American citizens and violation of the 1970 at 4A agency surveillance act, leaking and covering up the leak of the identity of Valerie Plain Wilson and holding American citizens without charge or trial. All of these are like that. At both the state and national levels Corretse says we will be paying for the Bush administration's illegal activities and terrible act of judgment and competence for decades, not only in the billions of dollars wasted on the war and welfare for the rich, but in the world by lost of respect for America and Americans. Bush and Cheney must be impeached and we will from office before they undertake even deadlier misdeeds, such as the use of nuclear weapons. There are no bounds to the willingness to ignore the Constitution and world opinion. We can't afford to wait for the next disaster and hope that we can survive. Absolutely correct. I just go on pause. You go, boy. I like that. California. Good arco. Excellent. I just dissent it to you. Back to you better hope I get out here real soon because during, as I'm sitting here, I keep going to be more and more you're going to think George was sending me. Back to George is listening which I'm sure he's not, but if he worked, while you're at home sick, you might as well send the Jackson X Distories. Now he's got that new deal. The audience will be pleased to know that George and Josh are about great new deals, man. Pretty much all signed up now with the new regime. Too bad those guys aren't going to be here much longer, but nevertheless, Tuesday morning at 11.30. I think that could be a day that will live in for me. Let's dig a f.r. up and see what he says about it. A day that will live in for me. May 2nd, 2006. The numbers will be coming out. Oh man can you imagine the green apple crisp that's going to be danced in the halls all Tuesday morning? Not really. No, yeah. Gonna be allowed a screaming and carrying on going on after that. Oh boy. And the best part of the whole deal is I can tell you would be on a shadow about these guys haven't got a clue of how to fix it. They haven't got an idea. Man, that's the best part. You know, I mean if they had like even some semblance, that's why you got 80 hours of guilty this afternoon after that stupid as ball game gets done. It is just shocking. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the people that are running this place now are on the payroll across the street. I'm not making any allegations you understand, but it wouldn't shock the hell out of me. Yeah, and you know who's got to be really laughing up his sleeve right now. Let me give you a clue. Do you think? Yeah. I bet you he's just laughing his ass off. He's still part-time in it in the Yorker doing whatever he's doing. I hope he'd have to find out. Whatever. Not that we really care about him. But but but then. And of course he was, you know, he was what he was. 760 votes, man. We're gonna have like 850 by no sweat for that thousand a day. I like I like this. I'm likely to have a lot of pressure. In addition, which we don't have the luxury that last 50 minutes today, we get touched short. Like I was at birth. What best describes most of the South Florida residents, rain dead 251, a solid 33% Rock solid. Illegals under 15. In fact, late to get rid of audio illegal aliens, we bring in some real decent humans. Average 93 in saying 75, reject 65 by so much negativity. Austria just 48, loser is 43. Fine Americans, there we go. This real positive one, only 38. And A whole 32. What I want is climbing. Just look up there, just look out to you, wonder you'll see the dance of the climbing A holes. They're climbing toward the top. They might have been climbing toward the top of your light pool out there. 560, 5056, they do have a marine doubt, a pre-isinary pod. Each your heart, a heart out, hever hever. And then we got some good stuff here. And quite frankly, I might have my throat. It must be these great, uh, supercalls. But I'm not the eating no more of these. Gotta get that blood sugar down under under 6,000. Go to think that, I think that's false advertising. We put on their sugar free. Well, there's nothing else in it that is setting the blood sugar up. So it's gotta be that. And it did the same thing last night too. See for a call, you were a bunch of liars, whoever makes that. Probably bear or one of those companies makes this crap. Look at on the thing here to see. I'm sure if I wouldn't, we got the box that would tell me who makes this garbage. I'm gonna sue their ass. All you'd like, what? I don't know what you're laughing about. This is serious, but beeswax, man. He's sitting there laughing. See, one of these days, I hate to say this. I hope you avoided one of these days. You're gonna be facing the same music, Mr. And you're gonna say, well, I sure would listen. I wish I would listen to that old fact. He had nobody was talking about from personal sad experience. I take care of myself, man. No, you don't. Yes, I do. I see that picture, man. You're looking a little chunky there. Yeah. See? See? You're looking a little bit chunky to me. You've got to be the owner of the world. Sit down, you're a badass. And they're eating all that free food now for the next 100 years. So that's not going to be any good either. That's just taking, you know, taking advantage of the benefits. Yeah, the perks. WQAM, hello. And congratulations to Josh and Georgie. Yeah. They made a first child be a masculine child. The three guys are definitely great emerging. They knew that part of some women that you just read about the California. He was on your girlfriend, sure. Randy Rhodes just today. Well, yeah. Broward. He broke that. That's a loose. He was hit the bar. Broward. Broward. Yes, sir. He wrote that. That's a good one. Yeah. I don't understand. I don't understandly. So I'm not. He just said. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Of course not. I mean, you think they're going to approve that in California. Arnold will have to be the terminal to go get their ass. Right. But the interesting thing is that Randy brought out Broward was that. She, um, the legislator there's democratically control. They're trying to come up with a nice way of presenting in impeachment resolution. Yeah. The silliest thing in the world. And then evidently, our Congress has to respond to that. So I can hear it. Hello, your breath. I'll let you know when I say or maybe Randy will tell you. Yeah. Next here. Okay. She's good at that. 26 past 11. We got almost 800 votes on the pool. Things are going on. How can you do it? I'm feeling I'm almost two. And you want to know why? Because you're a blood sugar storing. No. And actually my blood sugar is starting to come back down again. Thanks God. No. It's got nothing to do with that. It's got to do with the fact that we got that volume coming up. And it's already 40 eight degrees. That's about to cloud in the sky. It's going to be around 60. And it's 145. I'll be on the door. Wait a minute. It's 40. And it's going to be 60. Right. 59. Okay. Well, it's only 11. 30 in the morning. Don't you understand the way this works? Yeah. This isn't like Florida where it's like already probably like 82 in the highest of the 86 or like that. That's not how it works up north. And you've lived up north. So I don't know what to know. You haven't. Not really. Not really. See, see, see, don't know what it is. Like we'll change the temperature when it's like a nice crisp feel in the air. Like this morning when it was like a nice crisp 32. This is New Rogers. This is 5. 16. This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain being chopped abits by finally home meat fever. This is your brain in a flame. And this is your brain being stirred into a big pot of chili. Brains. Real food for real people. I rock this rat. We rock you. Then I ran. Must be the heat and all the sand. It's kind of a fuel. They got some bites. So the way I mean a big heart. Your bigger dichotomy come. Where is the man? Look, I get it. I know we could totally kick their ass. Right? That's right. Because we're vigilant. Tell me. We have a plan. Sure thing. The secret ran is directly responsible for that. Really? Well, they could be. They probably have terrorist dictators. Oh, that's bad. No, that's horrible. And when they don't hand over their weapons, the mass destruction. How do you know they won't? Like a police informant, they put it. Oh, we'll take a man. This is how the last day. Oh, you bet you're sure but I'm coming free. You mean military. Look, someone is Irene. Hey, I'll reset your government. Yeah. I can pray no suicide bomber. Yeah. Don't worry. They're blood-flipping. I'll let it be cooked. Well, what if they really do press the button next thing? You know, it's nuclear winter. We've got the solution in our back pocket. Letting you really want one more. Global warming. Level 32 of you. I am very bad to bullshit the taste. And I've been. Level 32. But it had a small one. 7801 on there. Like I said, it will be way over a hundred by noon. And I guarantee their jump and for joy and a sales department. I think I'll back there jumping for joy high five and a little five. And I got some base force news. By the way. What's that Ricky's not going to play? No, bigger than that. Oh, bigger than that. Canadian Steve Nash headed for the second straight NBA MVP award according to Arizona Republic. Canadian Boy, a Steve Nash. I love it. Although the sad part of it is they just kicked Toronto rappers of the Air Canada Center on Friday. NASCAR 20 points in attendance is that the Phoenix Sun's beat the rappers 140 to 126 are real. Welfan. Canadian Boy, my ass. Go back to Phoenix. You idiot. Anyway, the news paid for setting a league source for the winning. So the Sun's point card will become the tenth player to repeat his MVP. Magic Johnson is currently the only point card to one of your words twice. Did you know that? I did. Well, and now you know what's going to be Steve Nash. Did you know that? This is good. Why is that? I just like it when the white guy went to the MVP in the end. That was one of the most racially charged comments I ever heard in Michael Baker. Come on. How many white guys were in the last year? It's great. Just because it's a dark guy sport. That would be how much of Jerome McGinlow won the MVP in the heart trophy in the NHL. What? I don't know who that is. I know Peter Warren is a black player for the well. Peter well. I could have win any trophies. I don't think he's in the league no more. I could be wrong. But I'm pretty sure he's not. Jerome McGinlow's a superstar. 50 goals score for the Calgary flames. Same thing. Right. You better know your hockey mister because once you get past you'll know when that can. What's his name, Roberts? You're not too solid. I know my panthers man. You know you don't. You know, we're going to roll a bomb. Dave, you're going to master. How you said? Bowl master? Bowl mister? Bowl mister? You better know your hockey mister. Who? Only? Only. Only. Only yoke in it. Very good. Wow. Okay. Of course for a boy to. And I come on now. And I know the panthers. And. And the public said the effect. You probably know as many of Ms. I do. How about voice tech? Whatever his name is. I don't know. Who? What's your foreners? The republic said the official announcement may not come for two weeks. But the votes have been tagged. And just kidding, the boy's scheme. That's the MAP. If we're going to get him out. We're going to get him. He's small potatoes with a big head. How come he ain't going to get it? Huh? He's a. Black in produce. Oh, God. Well, you don't want to say you want to see a white guy get it. I said it's nice to see a white guy get it. And that would he just said George. George is not at his head at home. Marine Dowd writes a Prius in every pot. You see the heat fans. I think just because they'd be enough on a girl's team. The bowls. Yeah, you know. They feel pretty confident right about now. Yeah, they're real cocky right now. Just wait till they get there. We're good to the good team. Boy, I tell you one thing. I don't know anything about it. Everybody is saying, hey, the pistons would kick their ass from here. All the way to what was constant. Definitely. Not even a contest. So you can give you give me all that BS about pack right and pack right and slip haircut and all that other crap. You know, what's that kind of do with any icy sleeve? Anyway. What is that icy sleeve? Is that for like maybe I should put that on my shoulder. You think the icy sleeve or you would pain? No, not actually. Well, from this radio station, yes. Fact one job when the Clara Bell was in yesterday morning that should have been my comment. Because it is true. Even I could still lose a little more weight. I'm 180, 9 this morning. It's not too bad for me. I still got about 29 pounds I'd like to lose or maybe close to. Not turning man. But that's not too bad for me. Another net. Everything is just a hunky door. Man, there's only one negative in my life. And you know what it is. I'm going to go ahead and guess QAM. That's a good guess. 790 votes. What best describes most of the South Florida residents. In fact, if I will guarantee, I'm going to beat you my life out of right now. That if I had to still be there, this is the only thing I've said of when he left the station. I'll say it again. The only thing I think Greg read for is having a build this studio right here. Because if I still have what had to be down there, I'd be there in a box. You're entaid. And you'd be over there at Power 96 with all those losers over there. Yeah. And there are no white people over there anymore. Now the kid Kurt got kicked out. They're all Spanish. Are they really? Yeah. Like who? What? What many names? Yeah. Give me a couple of names. Who's it, Power 96? I'm a little bit. He's a little bit. What happened to that guy in the morning that got canned? Who, Albe Silk? Albe Silk? What happened? What happened with him? Um, I guess he just wasn't cutting it. He wasn't cutting it? Nope. Find enough? 790 votes. 390 votes. That's the correct answer. Very good job. All you people in the audience have voted on our poll on theorodures.com. Excellent job. Brain dead. 256. As in Q56. It leagles 120. Aberde 97. I guess I got another good one. Yeah. Schmidt. Yeah. Without the M. Yeah. I think that's, huh? Is that like a little too harsh? Is that over the top? It's okay. Oh, is it okay to put it on it? Aberde 97. In 175, reject 65, ostrich is 50. A whole 48. It's climbed a free spot. The climbing A whole's man are up that ladder. They're moving their climb and they're going to hop over the ostriches like they're lay. We got their head and sand. Losers 44 and fine Americans. Slementate trait didn't end away. 39. Trait an ove. Italiano. They're interesting. All of the Spanish and the Italian numbers are so similar. Isn't that interesting? Not really. But, well, the languages are very similar. Yes, they are. Now French are the other hand. It's like more than a row. They're like that. Because they're obnoxious. They always speak like that. Yeah. A lot of that. Yeah. A lot of that. Yeah. Oh, boy. I'm oriental, right? A pre-isit every pot. It's taken over five years. But George W. Boge finally made a concession speech to Al Gore. He considered that American needs to conserve by buying hybrid vehicles and developing new energy sources. Trying to count the gifts in his party in the country over exploding gasoline prices. Thank you by the way. Very much Mr. President again for those little gas prices. The president sounded like a bit like a wild-eyed ozone man himself. He asked the ex-doll and the virtues of alternative fuel to ride from cooking, grease, sugar, grass, wood chips, soy meat, oil, and corn. But then he got a hold of himself. He just got a recognized there. As there are a lot of so much corn can be used for ethanol. He said standing in front of a few college mural after all we got to eat some. You could run a fleet of SUVs on a gas that W was skewing about fuel. Bill Clinton would have been more likely to crack down on fast food than W and Dick Cheney would be to crack down on big oil. Even the usually supportive Wall Street Journal at the Turill page, chastised with Republicans for putting on Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi fight wings to shout about corporate greed and market manipulation. W's big move was to ever so slightly beef up a federal investigation to oil company. Pricedman's population has been under way since Katrina. It's a great idea to submit an democratic leader senator Harry Reid, so glad that we passed the law last year calling for it. Pricedman's population would explain the marginal by gas went from say 270 to 290, but not by gas went from 140 to 270. That's more about fundamental forces, Chinese and Indian demand, markets stooped by Iran's threats, Nigerians on rest, Venezuela's talk and nationalizing its oil industry. Topsets of Galilee in Venezuela. And the Pentagon's bug ring of the restoration of arrest infrastructure, so we can't hook up that tube. Gasoline prices may be hurting average folks, but the Oilers who help put the boy king and Duke of Alabama in office for the lavish donations are in drug and record profits in breathtaking bonuses. How about those Oilers they meet to you at an overtime again last night? The Oilmen and the Oval incompetent in so many ways have greatly achieved one of their main objectives, boasting the fortunes of the Oil industry and the people are running. All those secret meetings of us per her head back in 2001, letting the energy and oil big shots help by our energy policy, letting that urge more oil and gas to willing work like a charm. In all there is in government, Mr. Chetney and the Bushes have never done anything to hold the oil companies feed to the fire or get Americans feed off the gas pedal. As representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, the Republicans are the party with a key to the executive washrooms of Halibut and Nixon and the big oil corporations. Recently Raymond, originally retired as chairman and chief executive at Besson, recently we learned about his stunning secret compensation. He got more than $686 million from 1993 to 2005, according to a time story, which calculated that's 144,000 plus for each day he spent leading assounds. God pod is the executive switch the company's headquarters in Erick Texas is known. 144 granted they even not make a that. Even Josh Don't have any new contract. Only oil bearer it was in cashing in these days is sadum. We pulled up to the pump and bag that we've pumped down 10 billion a month and were not still like any any gas out of it. Instead of easing our oil dependence and pay for luxury construction, the bumbleed invasion and subsequent nuclear sparring with Iran have left even Republicans looking for preasces. The last time WB began ringing. ringing his hands about our addiction to oil and the state of the Union dress. The vice president was dismissive about the notion of sacrifice afterward. And the energy secretary clarified the president's words saying they shouldn't be taken literally and that the idea of replacing Middle East oil imports with alternative fuels was purely an example. Even if WB shows up on TV in a great cartigan, it's patently preposterous for the Republicans to make this argument. After selling us on the idea that's our manifest destiny to get into giant cars and go to giant walmarts and giant targets and form by more giant bags of stuff. Now they're telling us to squeeze the tiny electric cars and compete for precious riffs of oil with the Chinese Indians who are swimming enough of our dollars to afford cars. The US could have been developing alternative fuels 30 years ago. About 30 man. The titty hadn't helped settle on ambitious time in the Ford administration. By the time these guys get gas from cooking grease, global warming will have us cooked. That's your girlfriend, Marine Dada, the day night's going Marine, a preasce and every pot. And you'd even have to pay for it, how do you like that? Level 42 a QAL. This is Neil Rogers. This is 516. Fireland. Who the hell are the violence? One drive in a got a filled my ass to thee. Time and time, a day day day. Third oil, supplies they will over three weeks when it's another war. We have to pay yes. Now there's a hunger in the Ford state. I know cheap fuel for hell, but I'm saying it. Come on, let's know fair. What we got a fair date, come on, let's matter. Go after food and aid. Can't they get any higher? Fireland. Fireland. Go on, drive. Gorgeous out to sit today by the way, he would be here doing a show today. We're on a positive side of that except for the fact he's sick, because I'm a little alone. You know something if I would have not done it today, I would feel really bad about that. I feel guilty. Yeah, you would have. Because that'd be out there, a pleasure, my guess I already had already been down about, you know, 1500, 2000. Third tea, del Luna QA, and we got the Marlon Pregame show, 145 Marlon's and the Cubs. That's the third and final game. Marlon's trying to salvage one game. Just one. Just one time. Can they win it? No, probably not. Marlon said the Cubs had two twenty-felted by hours and hours and hours and hours. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All the guilty. All the time. You get them off from to the field. Now Friday we got, let me take over the schedule. Gully. Yeah. Oh. What did I tell you? I don't want to be an I Tony, so kind of guy, but I told you so. What's his boyfriend's took over that the trick of little children, and of course, our new General Mangler Claribel. He kind of sits back on the full. We want to lock you up for the rest of your life, Neil. And look at the great job we're doing getting all Josh and George St. Paul. Man, he is just pathetic. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty in the variety and secular wireless lines. You could not be over the feather. If you would ever told me before this all happened, that somebody would come into replacing Gregory that would make regular look like a rocket scientist. I want to say to you, you've got to be a stiff and glue man. You've got to be crazy. Course I shouldn't say that. I want to put you on a spot because you're right. You're at a very critical stage of your hot negotiation there. That's right. Yeah. So the less did the better. Come in to Q.A.M. Hello. Hey Neil, I'm worried today. Great. I'm talking about four cents a gallon per fuel. How's your weather? I was there once Caracas I couldn't wait to get out of there. Was there one day? I've been there multiple times. One of the things that I love about the way the fuel works other than it's really cheap is gasoline is the same everywhere. There isn't no competition in the price of fuel. Somebody may charge more and there's a little grocery store for a candy mark. No matter where you go the longest fuel must be the same everywhere. Yeah. I would have to think to you, go Chavez if they'd mess around now. Even if like 13 cents, that's the end of them. Oh, we're waiting. Okay. Oh, he's waiting for you. I think he must have understood, but nevertheless, maybe I was Pat Robertson Come, we're waiting to take out Hugo Chavez. Don't go to Venezuela. Don't listen to that last guy. Do not go there, man. It's just teeming with the mostly slippers. Crime? Oh, I don't want to go to the whole store again. Just I was in Caracas that one time. I thought it was going to be really pleasant. And I expected something totally different. And to drive from the airport to the city, you go through a lot of spontaneous man through all these winding mountains and zillions and zillions of these huts. They've all got like a 10-root touch with like a TV antenna on top. Oh, yeah. And they all look the same and it's all these slippers in there. And at night time, a lot of these desparados, they've been sent out into the city and just rob and rape and loot and plunder and not good. Yeah. I mean, I know a friend who knew a woman who went down there and was sitting in the cab, just like you were at her hand out the window. A guy came by and a bite cut her finger off took the ring. Right, there you go. So I did do it. And a finger no less. Oh, yeah. Maybe that's the finger that showed up in that show you when he's that time. That could be it. I think he just might have answered that dilemma. Oh, I'll let that turn out to be a scam, remember that? Yeah. That was a scam. Some bits that was running around, so when everybody inside, I can't think there's anything I can't stand is people looking for a suit and unless it's seep a call, though. I forgot to look at a box and see who makes this crap. WKOM. Hello. Hi. Hello. I think it has really helped my sore throat, though, remarkably. So, you know, either your blood shirt goes up. If one thing doesn't hit you, something else will get you right. Right. Can't have nothing's perfect. WKOM. K-O-A-M-Hello. Oh, run, hold. Something. We're not getting ready here. Yeah. WKOM. Hello. Yeah. Nail. Yes, sir. There's a scene in Gotton in part three where Mary is holding up a picture of Appalonia. And it looks like she's comparing and contracting. It's K as her mother or Appalonia as her mother. Really? She's calling me the other day that Mary was a K's mother. So, what she's doing? She's not Mary, but not K's mother. She's K's daughter. That is correct. Yeah, K's daughter. What was that look on her face? Why she was comparing and contracting her look? The look on her face was she just got shot where she said, D-D-D-D-D-D. And we're just thinking, oh, why could you then at me, my sooner, honey? This guy's trying like, I don't get how many. Take over. Get any of your wap. Freeze. Go and buy some. I don't know what more. See, if you want to believe that, that's fine. Okay. And I was, I don't know why you asked me the question. If you already have made up your mind, it's he was Appalonia's daughter, but she was not. Michael, I two children, both by K, now the one the bastard son. That was the son he saw. That was Andy Garcia Vincent. Yep. He was the bastard son, but at the very ugly, Guidoette, that was the son he was banging up against the door right there. Remember the scene at the wedding and some of his wife, she's talking to the other women there and she's doing the thing with her hands. Yeah. Remember that? She wasn't talking about how big the wedding cake was either. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, yeah. I think she was making some more in Bady reference there. WQAM, hello. I think George has come. Okay, good. WQAM, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. I got it, though. I was listening to your little pitch, and I'm a little bit worried about the impeachment. For most of the state states. Yes. And just as I was pulling that out of the intersection up here in people fall me, coming heading into a broader and that. I saw this bumper sticker, but it was, I don't know, I mean, I got it's rear window and it's the classic of the week so far. It read, I'd rather hunt with Dick than ride with Ted. I thought he could have charged out of that. That's good. Yeah. Okay, what's next, Colle? You were going to get this. Bottom's up. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60. It's the doggy psychologist on CNN. See, this is what we get. There's a poor old golden man. Looks like about 100 years old, and they got the doggy psychologist. They're trying to straighten his ass out. I should have a doggy shrink for a tiny, you know, try it a little bit. More stools dogs are crazy. Do you know that? Do you have a dog? Yes, I do. Now what kind of a dog is it? A pit bull. No, I said you have a dog. I'll feed you. I'll feed you. I'll feed you. I'll feed you. Yes, sir. I'll just, you know, they put this guy in Tony's snow. I get the rear-wrains and the rear-wrains of the chairs on the Titanic. This guy's been critical of Bush. Yeah, I know he's doing it. Yeah, this is a story that I sent to the BNR website to where he called him. Everything incompetent, everything out of the sun. I mean, you just know that they're going to be dragging all of those quotes on. I mean, you know, the fact that he's going to be a dog. I mean, you know, the fact that he's going to be a dog. I mean, the fact that he's going to be a dog. Yeah, I mean, but what do they think the Tony's snow is going to be able to take care of the washing can present? If we're going to say, is anybody can give a big snow job? He's a guy. Well, he is, but I mean, it's going to be a lie after lying. He's going to be smiling. I mean, it's a joke. I mean, I hope that they really re-entone snow a new ass. Hey, man. Hey, man. Yeah, maybe they can bring weed across the author and she can whisper some questions at the news conference. Mr. Stowley. You see, I don't know why we need to be single luck. Because we got guilty and many of our 10's all these other squeaky people on the air. We don't belong on the air. I mean, if it's good enough for MSNBC with all of general electrosmonies, if that's the best thing to put on the air, why should we expect a bullet like real broad broad cast is on, huh? Maybe that's where they're getting their ideas. I think it was a bad idea to put Schmidt on there. I think the people feel that would a little too far. No, so there's never any note, no Schmidt. There was just too low of a shot even for this show, which we ordinarily, you know, we can go as low as you want. Oh, look at that. Look at that. Look, now there was a little men pinned. Did you see that? Yeah, you know what? Did you see that little men pinned? Yeah. They're really cute. You don't want one, don't believe me. Oh, look at that little puppy. There, there you go. It is like a doxon, which by the way, to your terrible comment to my dog. But I've owned multiple retriever. Not a terrible comment. I hope retrievers. That's a dog. Anybody unless you've got a small place. You've got like a small apartment. You don't want them to too big. Right. I can't have one now. But the golden retrievers are almost like another human. Great dogs. I've also had two doxons. So, never hand one of those. I don't know. It kind of like straight. One of them really good. The other one is, you know. That's a good. You killed it. No, it was just fine. But 825 vote. It's always a sad day when you got to put the dog to sleep. You know, but then as the months go by, you realize boy, all the freedom you've got. What best describes multiple is sad for that was a terrible thing to say. I do want to apologize for that. That was a bad thing. You know, you like Steve Nash, wouldn't he, NBA, MVP? No, you're the one that said that that you're glad he won't. Because he's a white guy. You said that. Yeah, I glad to see a white guy win. Isn't that what you said? Well, that's nasty. What was it? This is a make what the color of his skin is. How about if the best player wins? Right. Bird. Larry Bird was white. And I think he was disgusting. You know, he didn't got it. Oh, he was good looking. No, I'm not just talking about good looking. Just a whole ambiance. I mean, he's just a, a yay who, free good about good looking. He just looks like Big Bird. So you know how many good looking seven foot tall guys are there anyway? You know, they're freaks. Right. Of course, except for a, well, that's another story. He's, he's, I see, he got the icy sleeve. He's got something up his sleeve. 825 votes. That's kind of like Joe name is who could really play. Well, why is it, most of these, most of these dogs can't speak. What is that? He's got a, a first rat for it. He can speak. Hmm.

Forget about that, that's just for starters, that's just to start playing with our money a little bit, then you hit the 3000 line then you run out the door. They put the money in your hand, you say thank you very much, you give me 20 and you run out the door. And I'm sure that you're going to be tipping the attendance when they start playing ours.

Just keep that in mind, I had somebody other day with somebody, oh, I don't know, would never tip the attendance, and say, what if what tells wrong with you, they're going to look at your asset there for like hours, not job. Some people just don't know that I should write a book on casino on gambling etiquette, wouldn't that be good? You wouldn't have to, what? I said you would know. Yeah, I'm racing, no etiquette. Get all you back to it's ready for this summer when they finally open up those damn slots. Finally, somebody QAM, hello. Yes, sir. Just like you thought, I'd like to know that gas prices were as low as 245 a gallon in Jersey, like two weeks ago. I went up to Hershey PAN, I went to through Jersey to go to Hershey PAN. What do you have, yeah? And I got to tell you PAN is gorgeous, especially Hershey Town on a free chocolate, but it's very, very nice there. Anyway, that's... Yeah, 5605, 505, 60. I knew that.

I just want to make sure these other ones are still functioning, because after what we had the other day, you could never be too sure. Thanks to Bell South by the way, thanks to that fabulous job, welcome to me back from vacation Monday. That was a beautiful thing. With phones ring like crazy, but we couldn't see where we're ringing and what they were dingin and what was going on because Bell South sucks. They may not be good, at least they're consistent. One thing about the utilities in South Florida, Florida, Florida, plunder with loot, there's another one for you. Got their hands in both your pockets, and they're sticking their foot right and back to them, that's it as far as they can. WQAM Hello. Needle the John Ballman socks. Yeah, I'm good. WQAM Hello.

Yeah, he's got up his sleeve. Well, I'll tell you one thing, if I'm going to depend on these colors today to be on me out till 145, forget about it. They really suck. Very, very slow down to dribs and drives. Now, this is what happens when you spoil the audience and you're seeing and you're spoony feed them and read all this crap day after day. I'm not going to do it. Not today. I throw this feeling much better now. I feel right in that pull and put it at button move, you know. Not going to let these people move me off my appointed grounds. 847, you're ran out of pull 847. We'll have that thousand before you can say Joe Bell's a goofball. Say it though. WQAM Hello. WQAM Hello. Hello. Yes, hello. Yeah, I'm probably a god dog. WQAM Hello. Hey, how are you doing? Okay. Now, with Michael in the god father, he very not the only a, he got blown up in the car. So, he couldn't have had a kid because she got drove a few days after they got married. Right. There was no baby and she got blown up. Of course, we've mentioned that yesterday, but this guy still wants to insist that somehow she was Mary's mother, even though she was dead and she was never pregnant in the first place. Maybe it was an immaculate contraception or maybe to got a call to just an embassy if it's possible. But one other question, when he moved over there, he had the black guy from a costume. So, when he proposed that black guy, he already did it to the key. He was pretty busy with his canole there. Yeah, okay. Whatever you say. And don't forget. Please, I got, take the canole. Don't you talk about the black guy? Well, the black guy was in the godfather. I missed the movie he saw. I don't know. There actually isn't any. No, there are no black people. That's why Josh liked it so much. 560, 560, 560, 560, 560, I bet you Steve Nash is in it though. What do you think? In fact, maybe that was an old Nash rambler that she was driving when it blew up, but I'm being like that. Remember? Yeah, you driving alone boss, you going to law you driving now. Sunday, Saturday, Monday, that'll teach her to scrub the days of the week. WQAM, hello. Hey, no. Yes, sir. What's up? How you doing? You're doing like it all the time. You're trying to go to the river. It's just out there. No, okay, good. Somebody QAM, hello. Tom Gustav's son. Ha ha ha, alright, lives. WQAM, hello. No, I challenge you to find true happiness. WQAM, hello. Hey, you don't have a spot man back to the pivot spot. Hey, don't you? Okay. Good. It didn't say the black guy. He said that Michael had a black eye. He threw at the black eye. He said he had a black eye. He said he had a black eye. He's what he said. No, no, no, no, he had a black eye. You know what the black eye. Oh, right. What do you say brown in Spanish? Five, six, seven, five, six, six, six, six, six, six. I don't even have any idea. I say brown. Other mentioned Spanish. You trying to think. You're supposed to be. Now let me ask you something. You just see Agro. I noticed at the end of the show yesterday. George played at the Celia Scotty Maccrap. Right. Uno dos traced. Whatever that crap. And this and just the Agro comes on quadro. I think go say what I've cram. What is he trying to tell us? Well, that's good actually. What is he like people responding to our drop? No, I understand it. I'm not even though they let us play the whole drop. That wasn't the whole drop. We got cut off. But hey. Why is that? All right. I got to tell you right now. I don't know where the hell it is. I know what's it. Oh, here it is. It's under smack. It's like. I touched her dad. Yeah. Oh. You're not yours. Good. George Rodriguez. No good. On another span. Especially on. Thanks honey. Okay. Everyone's we hit all these in here. Look at this. Scotty Mac. My God. Oh yeah. That feels great. Oh, brother. You never met Scotty Mac and boy. You were lucky. Talking about a silly person. You know, somebody's people like college kids who like the negative to be like 35 and they're still like college kids. And they do silly pranks. They're like overgrown children. You know, I can't kind of like what we got there running away. You're saying, kind of like that. That's got to me. Twelve minutes passed no to QA and we got Marlon Gim and then we got guilty for 48 solid hours. Good. But that's the reason you're trying to do this. Because maybe you should think a lot of you. All the slime all the time. Hello. I'm Naomi Campbell. God bless. What makes it? I'm a kid. Originally we've come under our scrutiny for using our silly or phones as weapons. This is how mustn't do about a hand do. You can't do this. Isn't ridiculous. Good on these people coming up and trying to interrupt me when I'm just me ladies. What are you doing? You don't see me recording it tonight. You're playing. You don't understand. Are you the one that stole my jeez? That's the one that took you all games. Go out. What would I be doing with a woman's fair jeez? Get it. I think he stands. I think we killed him. But he can take you all jeans. And he didn't make fun of your hair. There's a muster do about a hand do. That's what I was saying. This is what the phone should be you for. That's just for dying. Text message in. Or incident use. But for opening up people's hands. Not can call. Not. Humiliated. You don't. Oh, I see you have so full. I'm knocking too. Okay. Give me huge rice cake. Those are your. I'd like to make the call. Like for a report. Let's give him our sales. Let's give him. Let's give him. Another example of great setting a phone use. Just a much of new one. But I can't. What should we do now? Call me. What's going on? I'll tell you what now. Let's go to my office. That has some profit. It's too many ladies. What? I need to see some of my deep. I'm that advocate. No, you know who I am. I want to miss the elderly. And you never will. I am on super motor. I'm a couple. That's so one mile. I still need to see your ID. I got my whole right here. I'll get you my friend. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're a beautiful girl. People are by the committee to make cell phones legal weapons. Come 18 to QM. Here's a sensational. A funny thanks from Matt and South Beach supposedly. Guess what, Matt? My numbers are still sensational. And number two, the idea that Miami is the most dynamic city in the world. You must not get in the house too much. Okay, must just strictly enter on South Beach. I got those. What? I was going to say I got something else sensational. What's that? How you say brown and Spanish? How's that? You're not going to believe me. Maroval? What? Marron? Marron? Is that like Maracone? No. Like Buna. Well, Marron? Marron? Marron? I mean, uh, don't start an idea. I can't start a corner. Anyway, Matt would a costico. I'm glad your ratings are going on the tube. Unless people are being your obsolete swivel. You're out of touch. Your mama, mama, me. But we'll get on doing this. Fine. Okay. And this idea, if you're happy with what Miami is in downtown and uptown and all the South Africa stay there, Matt. It's a perfect place for you. Okay. I got another one for the pull by the way we didn't put on. I wish we would zoom up their hostile. Yeah, hostile. See, if it was only me, Matt, I say, well, I'm just a malcontent. I don't like this, but I mean, but it would, but it's not just me. In fact, most most people that I know basically say the same thing. But then that's okay. You'd like enjoy it, Matt. In fact, you'll be the only one on it, Metro mover. Just like on the Metro fail. You'll be on it, right, and that one. Right, and that's a high allele. The name right, I'm not going to waste my time with this thing about. In fact, this is probably from across the street. It's what it looks like to me. Oh, yeah, everybody is recording the people on the ticket. And 790 this, but I'm going to be put it up throughout. Well, big deal. So, in fact, me, can I have a new with this show? Here's one. It says the Holy Land experience biblical theme park near Orlando. Won't have to be property taxed at a real pass today by the house. Park officials describe the five-year-old Holy Land experience as worthy of a Bible-based history museum and a religious, and by the way, I notice Matt still listening to. And it religious education visitors can enter a replica of Jesus tomb or C. Jesus Heal of Blondman climb the stairs of a fake harrod's temple and traveled on a recreation of Via de la Rosa. The park has been a battle with tax officials in Orange County. Of whether it's required to pay local taxes, but the bill is meant to clarify that the nonprofit park is exempt from local property taxes as well. Bill passed a house 93 to 25 still needs Senator approval in your Yahoo of state. Martin and Kate Kroll see all the taxes just came in because they didn't bother putting anybody else in their assuming it's his one person can do all this. Now the judge is out six today. So obviously Josh during a break to set a governor in the middle of the whole pile of taxes. No, including that love tax or Matt, who not only is listening today, but obviously we're talking about Europe a lot of beat but a boot. Yeah, quote everything I say on a show, but I'm out of touch and ratings around the tube and I'm about feeding a bunch of soil and obsolete and all this other stuff. So I'd be like the show, Matt. Martin and Kate Kroll says I can't listen to your show daily, maybe twice a week. So I know if you already mentioned the new movie coming out May 24th and in Ken Viniad truth. Starring Al Gore, it's about global warring and effect on the earth. That should be pretty said, lady, and we'll be starring Al Gore. People can take to see movie on opening weekend. I do check articles on your website daily, though great articles linked to a movie trailer, climate crisis.net. His Martin and Kate Kroll. His John and this is John from McCombie South Carolina. This is put that on anymore because you know, is retired that. Otherwise, movie without Gore might, I might fall asleep quicker than network. I would imagine so. Annel, he says. Well, we can say that in the garden where we're pull. We certainly can't say that in the garden anything else, but we can say it on the pull. You've got it. Okay. Also, please add nasty to the full somebody says. And now I have no idea what this facts is. Where did this come from? Larry, can you get an office or a cell number for this George? Did you see this? No. Maybe you didn't see it. Where did I come from? You sent it to me. Oh, I didn't. You didn't. Trust me. I said. George is handwriting and it's got to be a. Why? There you are. By the way, some. This board doesn't work. What are you talking about? Miguel isn't there. He got into eat lunch and he's sent you those facts. And the board in there is not working correctly. He can't hear you. So what do I do? Why do I do you hear me? You're not. You're just in there eating lunch. Well, George might have some technical issues. That's all he's saying tomorrow. Honestly. Well, a little bit that'll take all the fun out of it. We've correct that today. This is true. That's the QMF. And that's a math and math and math. And so basically, to the end, special to me, I'm sure he hears. Our technical screwups. Matt loves it. Even though, of course, all the sports people over there at 7. I do the take. We'll find out about that next Tuesday. We'll see if they can crack a one. If they can crack a two share any time during your sports numbers, we know they're not going to crack a two in midday. We know that. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, there's still still sucking wind. Okay. Steve says, pull suggestion, which TV characters could ever be played by only one person. Examples. Columbo, Peter Falk, or she bulk her Carol O'Connor, Paramation Raymond Ver. I don't, I mean, I appreciate Steve making a never-forced, but not like a little ridiculous. That's beyond ridiculous. Yeah, because whoever plays characters like the ones he's talking about, I mean, any, you know, right? Yeah. Not just anybody can play. Who else could have played the funds, right? I mean, I just, thanks Steve, but don't do that again. Hey. Yeah. There was one black eye in the guy, father. He was cartoons have remember, cartoon. I'm not going to raise him though. I'm going to put him out to stud and then put his head in my bed. Cartoons have written his name was, is this though? I'm supposed to know that. I may be a godfather of fame, but I'm not a crazy person yet. He says, I know the answer. Jack Waltz says to him, thanks blank his name. Long time was me, Larry, the appraiser. Well, thanks, Larry, but you could have told us, because the way the trend of insurance and purgatory, that I would know the answer to that, do you? Of course not. No. Not going to raise him. We're going to put him out to cartoom. Cartoom and he's like, and then he says, I don't get how many day go get any walk, free, small, good boys come out of the wood, what exactly? And then he also said, Well, let me tell you something, my crock, McFran. Where's the one where he says he never gets, oh, I don't know. That's not it. That's not worth it. Okay, thanks, Larry. You're a praiser. So the board there isn't working right. What are you, novelty? Not saying I want the next error bill. He's got that place running like our clock. Like big Ben. 887. We need 113 votes in our 25 minutes. That should be easy, shouldn't it? Give to that thousand by 12 by, oh, is it 1245? I'm going to get that music crank, if we're going to have a game of 1245. Now, we're going to shove an else today. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I'm thinking we ought to, you know, borrow us on deck at 145, because it's in Chicago time, so there's one 20 game is 220 hour time in that with these sucks. I mean, 15 minutes, I'm not going to, I'm not going to look at gift Ha's in the mouth even if it is cartoon, but that's not much of a big deal. Now, like some kind of big bargain. Yo, you get off early tomorrow, 15 minutes. Woo! Ha's down, low votes for Ha's dial yet. I'm surprised I said that won't go zooming up there. 567 even Ha's dial faxes from people who are listening. Let's see, that's the best part. I hate you. I'm listening, I heard you say this, you have a name, and in last Monday you said this, but I mean, but I would put it down like that. By the way, I have a question, because you said, where it out reminded me of a hostile, do you know, because it came up to Hostels, you have your own room, and you share a bathroom, or is it just a bunch of beds? So you're talking about that different kind of hostile, like a USTED, the NSTM all over Europe, especially in Amsterdam, and places like that, where a lot of young Tongs go, you know, back packing. Now, what's the deal with those? I would know, I have been inside of a hostile, I'm just scared of maybe you would know. No, I would not know. I know there's a Zidin, I'm why you're playing on the state of Mom, you got to Amsterdam? That's probably the only way. I would have thought that now it would all have a big busty guy, you'd say, like, at the Grand Crescent Polskier, one of those five star hotels, which aren't all that great anyway, but they're okay. But you want to stay at some youth hostile for like about three bucks a day or something like that? Probably, yeah. You know, actually charged for the roaches. In fact, you're probably fine, Zidin's a miniaturase. Now you like it there. I think George Rd. Not he's got that new contract. You ought to like write your check. All right. To hop on a plane, send you over there like coach class. And record, strap you up. We'll strap you up against the tent of the railway. I'll stand. I'll stand. No big deal. Yeah. We'll strap your ass up on the inside of cabin. Or maybe in cargo. And then once you get there, you'll have a whale of a time. You're entied, can't look. Anybody can't have a good time there. I'm really burned out on that place. You know, I just, I really am. But if you can't have a good time there, then you're like dead. Or maybe you're brain dead, like sounds hard. I agree. And I haven't even there. Right. But you're anxious to go. I can see why. And then, of course, when you would walk around in the red light district, and you look at the, not so much the ones down by the canal there, without, well, I don't even know what you call that area. By the old church. Ah, not good. Now, what about the red light that? And it was to need to dark. I beg your pardon. And you good in the red light district. That's what I'm getting to. If you'll just be patient. But if you go on the, I can't think of the name of the street, but it's a long street where they have all of these, you know, strip shows and all these, all these, played dens of an equity. And on that street, it's also a major part of the red light district. And there's like almost all white chicks, nose windows. And man, oh man, you, your tongue would be on the top of your shoe. Or maybe on the bottom of your shoe. Maybe you'd be stepping on it. And then it's tongue too. You wouldn't believe you stick to myself. I can actually go in there and pay a few bucks and get, yeah, you sure can. And you'd save yourself. I don't think I've ever even this place. Although, of course, there's always downtown Miami. This is a Neal Rotterdam, where's half of it in baby vids? Is 5.16. How are David's a bitch? Massage. You're a bitch. You're a bitch. And a cold text. Not possible. It impains sight. It's a truth. You know this right in front of you. Oh, dad! What's the truth? You know the truth Jesus was married. No, the had children and no. What did the bitch know? Jesus, how did they pet? Oh, the... I'm sorry. What Jesus had their pet? I'm sorry. I still don't like to tell you. He's a name and was a scouter. Uh huh. The defense you tell. You thought that he'd just see God from down there? People must know. Don't listen. It's a... A line of fictional secret. It's no longer a secret. And even more. Here they are. Oh, God. I didn't think she'd tell. Did a free Jesus father had last class? I'll write that on the internet, especially in South Florida. You know, I dug this... The past still facts out of the waste basket. Because, ordinarily, I have fun with these. I never failed to read one. Okay, this one was just over-diculous. But I think I think to make the point. Because it fits right in with the pull we're taking today. What do you got? Mad and South Beach, right? So I thought that you might find it interesting, although I don't. That last night when Channel 10 was reporting the big, the big story of the Rickie Wiggum Suspension, it went straight to the 790 of the ticket studio to get fans reactions. I've seen other channels do the same. It seems that everybody's forgotten WQAM. If you had a sling box which is advertised in your station, you'd be able to watch it from there. Well, guess what, Max? I don't have a sling box. I don't have a sling box. I'll leave you're slinging it pretty good. And I have the link to it to watching Channel 10 News or 467 or any other ones. Or Vainty Trace. But here comes the good part. Also, you mentioned yesterday about how great your business is because everything is close together. It can be a public transportation. I didn't say anything about greater not created. It just said that the gas price is not as relevant there because they don't have to drive long distances to do it or work, etc. And they have bicycles and motifs and public transportation, etc. That's what I said. I didn't say anything about greater not great. Did I? No. You'll be happy to know that Miami here comes the good part. Miami is adding a street car system to midtown uptown in South Beach, addition to the Metro mover and miles of Metro Metro Rail, a metro rail being built, which will also connect at a hub at the airport. There are tens of thousands of new luxury housing units being built down town by the Exteroorfist buildings within walking distance. There's also a new museum park being built between the new Performing Arts Center and the arena. As well as entertainment complex going into a new, next to a new downtown mall that's bigger than the Eaton Center. That's right. There malls going to be bigger than my mall. There will be no need for anyone downtown to own a car. Of course since you haven't been to downtown Miami since the Panthers left. And guess what? Neither is most anybody else. You are oblivious to the fact that downtown Miami has become the most dynamic city in the world. Is there anybody who believes that? I'm sorry. I must have missed that. Can you read that one more time? Since you haven't been to downtown Miami since the Panthers left, your oblivious to the fact that downtown Miami has become the most dynamic city in the world. It's good to know that your ratings are going down the tube. Tube! So that less people are hearing your obsolete swirl. Or is it the other way around? Less people are listening because your outer touch material is outdated and absolutely love, Matt, and South Beach. So I think about the news, you met a city, a place, isn't about buildings. It isn't about shopping malls. There are plenty of places that have shopping malls. I'm sure we're telling you how they got big shopping malls. It's about people. It's about attitude. It's about the lifestyle. It's about the way people treat you and where you feel treated. And where you feel treated and where you did just your life in general. So this idea, they can build 70,000 miles of metro rail and they can build 50,000 more shopping malls. 40 times bigger than the freaking eaten center in downtown Toronto. And that's something to do with it. That's that will make the city. But just a one line. I'm very curious about the sarcasm of the end, which my ratings are not going down the tube. I hate to break the news to you. Here we go. How about all the bombs in homeless in downtown Miami? I don't know because that's what I think how I go to the panters plan. By the way, since the panters were when they were playing, I went to every home game. When I was in town, I went to every home game at the old Miami arena. I knew like that. And drive it out of there by the way, it was no picnic. Speaking of what you're talking about. Well, there you go. But Miami has become the most dynamic city in the world. I got news for it. And people guys with the butterfly nets and rubber raincoats, they're after you man. They'll be after you real quick man, if they find you. You'll be in a white suit. You'll be in a zoo to a rubber room in five minutes if they find you after writing crap like that. The most dynamic city in the world. But you know, to eat it so on. Oh wait, when are is this another one? I don't understand this. I'm getting fashes now as Miguel and they're writing stuff on here. No, he's just sitting in there sending you fashes. Oh, oh, here's Jimmy Siffel is his sports director of channel 10. Well, not only that, but channel 10's got a bug up the rest because he made it. So many stuff on it. Sports show of theirs when they told him what kind of beer he ought to be drinking. Nobody tells him that dog would kind of be very drink. That's exactly right. So he told him to stuff it. So channel 10 of course is going to build up the other guys. Just like they Harold is building up the other guys because it got great co-text and then it'll pass it on their payroll over there. So that's like a basic prize. Like a, you know, one thing I've told you before you can. I've been in this market for 30. 30 long years. Okay. You can't talk yourself into ratings. Okay. Either you've got him or you don't got him. And you can 790 me from now until the cows come home. They haven't got squat. You couldn't find their audience with a damn compass and a road map. Yeah, Jimmy Siffle is just half of it. This is made the sports right. And by the way, there's literally $3.5 million net is what's going to be the loss. The first year under dolphin broadcast. God only knows how much further they're going to lose next year. So they can give you a big song in the dance. They'd lie to the South Florida business year and I'll tell you how much money they made. And they're doing this. They're losing their ass. Just like at least we had no where losing their ass on the freaking marlins. Who are coming up at $1.45 by the way? See, I don't have to lie about such stuff when a ratings come out. And I go through that hole is I don't make them up. I don't I don't try to talk to my son of a, Oh, look at this. We got a 42 share. Yeah. Well, how can you do that? How can do that when anybody who's, you know, wants to kick go online. Can't eventually get the numbers. I mean, right there in black, white and pink. But thanks for listening religiously though, man. I'm glad you're I'm glad you're a happy camper, man. It's you know, not everything is that we all have different tastes. If downtown my image for you, I'm delighted. It ain't for me. Drystone, Philip and Dave County. Even Miguel didn't Miguel get out of the day County. Yeah, he did. Even Miguel who's a professional Cuban, even though he's never been to Cuba, even he who's obsessed with anything having to do with Cuban, including cigars. He don't live in my day County anymore. Even that little strict George lives in Hollywood. Now, last time I checked that's in Broward County. Not a day County. Why? I anywhere near downtown Miami. So I just just mentioned that. You don't try to single be because I'm obsolete, not a touch. Hey, you know, something more power to me. I hope wonderful thing happened because there are a lot of nice people in softflow. It is your best thing to happen for them finally. Like maybe get out of there would be the best thing that would happen. Is there is there a week that goes by that we don't hear from people who tell us that they're finally getting out. How about that guy to call before that city was going to go visit San Diego for a few days. And the only regret he had was any had to come back. How about that guy? Did I make that up? No. It's a horrible horrible. There is no downtown. There is no anything. There is just a bunch of disconnected bedroom towns. That's what South Florida is all about. If the chamber commerce don't like it, two-stick it bad. I lived there for 30 freaking excruciating years. And it sucks. You got your pepper pines, plantation, and sunrise, and western. And you got your Hollywood. And you got your Miami. And you got your west sweet water. I think I've kindle. And the homestead, all of these things. And the junk. And it's just a big scrub coral springs. I hit left that up because you lived there. Once upon a time. Yeah. And then nothing. None of my things do with each other. There's just one bedroom town after another. As a matter of fact, when you fly into Miami, you're flying anywhere for a lot of Dale. And you're on the approach. And you can see as you're coming over the corner clear day, when you come over the coast, these coast to Florida, you can just see there. There's like no end. It just connected all the condos on the ocean. It just connected one bedroom town. Here's Del Rey. And here's the airfield. Here's Compado. There's a four-larito. And then another way of making it do with each other. There's no downtown. There is no magnet. There's magnets, but there's no magnet. And if you like it, I'm ecstatic for it. Let me say it again. The greatest thing that ever happened in my life was escaping. Believe me. It's escaping. I feel like I escaped from Alcatraz, from Death Row. But Matt, you know, he's got the answers. What time's your show on, by the way, Matt? And what time's your date with Jimmy? 920 votes on the poll, which best describes versus South Florida residents and see. The reason these are mostly so negatives got to be my fault, right? Because it's all of the people you don't just agree with me. It's right. You hostile bastard. You dance right. I'm a hostile man. Dirty old bastard. Dirty old D.O.F.B. Dirty old Fag bastard. Third, we call him. Yeah. Rained, 27. Elegols 132. Average 108. A.H.L.S. 93. Boy, look at the way that did I take it was timing or what? 93. It's in fourth place. It's going to pass average like they're sitting on their metro rail. By the way, nobody rides a metro rail, Matt. Hey, to break the news, too. In saying 82, reject 70. Austria's just 50. Final Americans 45. Losers 45. Well, losers could be final Americans. It's just unlucky. Like no green memory, just unlucky. That's given off the top. Hostile 6. A.L.1. Schmidt 1. And nasty none. None yet. This is real Roger. I sure demand this is 5.62. A.L.S. A.L.R.POP, little boy. The streets are like robbing you. We're blind, but how sweet it would go. That would have time to head south and run. All right. I want to go with a living to death. I'm dying out of here. I have no life. Along the nail front line bill! I want to get earthy at your balance. I want to come running for me, on the clouds. This is a dream for everyone. Come to the sky!
