Now I've been standing here waiting online since Windows 90. But did I own one smelling teacher, a vintage one of up-one-and? And I have articles of all my shots because I am in a little late at night. I'll be an item of slavering blogger who is better leading to the tan. I can type with my facts to be serious with only one hand. Okay, 10-1 at 5.60, WQM happy Thursday, 2 November 30th. And what is it? But third name. Wow, it is the last day November already. You must December 1, or you've said it about that of course not. Nothing excites you anymore because you're old and you basically gave up. That's right. Long time ago. Sure. That's about nine years ago. Or so. And anyway Miguel is evil in the anti-Christ and I'm going to curse him out for four hours today. You know that whole mind-spacing thing. Why did you do that Miguel? Anyway. Why? I'm too old. You know, the star I admire life is just fine waiting. You can see it involved there. I don't want to be involved. I don't read the messages on there. I don't get involved with it. I don't want to know from it. And by the way, Jeff, hi. Go sell some spots for the people you're working for. Leave us alone already. You clown you. Come. So yesterday we had the story about the kittens that got like whatever they had fried and twisted and yanked. And then we had the story about the little baby in the microwave. Well, shambu the killer whale. Did you see this? Yeah. It was just watching the report this morning. And you're the trainer during a show at Sea World at the Bay of York. Go into Park and San Diego by grabbing his foot and pulling him underwater twice. Go against about time. The animals struck back like it all. Leave like the crack guy. That's right. That's right. Leave these poor freaking animals alone. If we're not going to eat them, leave them alone. That's right. If they're not going to be really tasty and delicious and give it away. The three-nanual man was hospitalized in good condition after Wednesday's show said Mike Scar Puzi, a park official. Scar Puzi, who oversees of logical operators, and they didn't know the extended trainers injuries and we don't really care. The park to climb to release the trainers name saying some members of his family have to be notified. He's a whale of a guy though. Scar Puzi said the trainer has been working on animals for 60 years, including 12th-finite shambu stadium. Oh, oh, oh, shambu stadium. What are you kidding me or what? See, Mike can't really leave those animals alone and they're native habitat in the ocean where they belong and quit like, oh yeah, put them in the circus. You know, right. We got 20 of people to work for us that we had to put in the circus, but who would believe them? Here's the pull result from yesterday when 1653 votes. And by the way, since the calls came back, man, we are just kicking big, pimpley smelly ass you wouldn't believe it. You believe it? Nope. That's all right.

You know, which is good. It's fun Ray Beckerman, a lawyer representing clients and cases against the RAA A recently to partner conference color organized by the Defected by design.org an organization which opposes the RM technology content restricting programs embedded in the software that Black seuses access to music movies software other forms of digital data Beckerman describes how internet uses are randomly targeted by the RAA For simply having a folder of music on their computer kept in the dark about legal details and intimidated and paying Thousands of dollars immediately are facing a federal freaking lawsuit The RAA doesn't even attempt to prove copyright infringement with specific examples dates or times It simply coerces and threatens the victim until they relent and paying out huge settlement fees They have an investigative pretend to be user of Kazah or one of the other similar file sharing networks He finds a shared file folder that has a good number of copyrighted songs in it He has no idea whether those song files were obtained legally whether through paid down loads or to make And personal copies from on zone CD for backup purposes or by the way I think illegal was ever done with those files whether anyone ever copied one and what he does He takes a screenshot of the shared files folder Of course does not see the folders immediately sees the text in the metadata and decides this is a big shared file folder You following this then through some secret process Which he will not share with us and try to conceal from the courts even Associates it with a dynamic IP address And then after he has what he believes is the correct dynamic IP address for late in time Which he has made that screen shot even brings a proceed. We get the name of address of the subscriber We'll pay for the internet access which of course would tell us nothing But once he gets that information and even sue the person in one case UMG versus Linda Ray Cleaner who's never used her own a computer But simply does the near one Does the near one was suicide an online distributor in peer-to-peer file sharing?

And if you're on one of those Gay then it's queer to queer file sharing Accusing the RAAA of conducting a window terror by bringing lawsuits against defenseless people back in and warned that in one case in particular Electroversus Barker has the potential to shut down the internet's completely. How do you like them bananas? Quintabanana RAAA's argument is that misbarker a poor nursing student who lives in housing project should be prosecuted on the basis that Mirrorly making files available on the internet is in and of itself a copyright infringement. Well, copyright my ass How do you like that? I'll go get many Works Beckerman calls the confidate shocking argument because if we were accepted it would probably shut down the entire internet One of the UK's biggest technology news websites The inquiry also the highlights the frightening development and article in title RAAA wants the internet shut down the US government is also filed legal breach supporting the RAAA's crap Deep 16th the internet seems highly unlikely and that would probably derail the world economy and put thousands of huge Transnational corporations out of business and I've come more likely to happen if this ruling is accepted is that would further pave the way for government regulation and tracking of the internet Namely internet too a Completely controlled surveilled and automatic or autocratic several police states one of the Chinese model Where by website owners have to obtain government permission to run a blog We improve by a biometric thumb scan just to turn their computer run and immediately get there in an ass I shut off if they miss behavior How do you like that if you worked the word crap on like a in a chat room you're out?

I have no idea. I'm not in the world. And that Arya Josh, I have played fantasy football. I didn't do it this year. In other words, you reformed. You got over it. No fantasy football is actually kind of cool. It's just like me, or with that mice face. I was offered for about five minutes now. I'm back on it. I don't hear any knock on the door yet. Oh, yeah. I only wish. Why just would like to get that over with? Don't you hate that? I like dialing my friends. It's so great. You give them to our window when you're going to be sitting on your ass watching TV and you're going to be home. And then deliver that to our window. I mean, 1032, that's a pretty broad, you know, I could be out in the Bob doing stuff right now. Can I? Or I guess not. So it worked out just perfect. See, when I go, good timing on your part. Whatever. Oh, there's new from the makers of head on. I'm getting a headache from the whole damn thing when you come right down the way. I really am. I'm getting a pounding, shrubbing headache. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, and it's clammy in here to I think just before you croak, it gets real clammy. It's cloudy and tomorrow starts wintertime. Oh, it is going to be chilly here tomorrow. I'm going to wish I was there. Well, I'm not really. You think I wish that I was there? No. No. It would take like 15 feet of snow in about minus 82 for me to wish that I was there. It's already like 59 degrees here. Although it's very murky and cloudy and it's going to be dripping later on. And then maybe some snow and freezing rain later on. Freezing rain. I hide tomorrow 40 in the high and Saturday of 36. And I hide on Saturday of 0, a Celsius, 32 for an eye. A high, which you can relate to. How do you like that? So when is coming starting tomorrow? So we've got to enjoy today. I've got to get out of here right now. An area of highly apartheid racetrack once designated in a historic by the city's historic preservation board will no longer be considered as such after the sea council voted unanimously to take away the historic billing. The measure was improved to allow the demolition of the horse stable section of the 200 acre park. Mayor Julio Rabayna said hurricanes and termites have damaged the more than 60 year old wooden structures. He argued that the structures were an eye sore and need to be cleared. Put it in a bomb agrande over there in a highly apart. That's a good idea. In fact, maybe just over all a highly. But not if you're really even better. Our friends in highly will give you like advance warning. So you can step through the limbo rocket, the T-Roman JC pennies they were in Westland. Oh, those, those people, man. Yeah. You know the crowd I'm talking about? Yeah. Your people. Your people. That's a game club you more. And you know what they're doing at Westland. Look at the glory hole. That's right. Anyway, but residents on hand voice concerned the taking away the historic classification of the horse tables at highly effacing palm avenue in the 37th street would pave the way for development rather than preservation of the historic park which was welcome presidents and foreign dignitaries for horse races. Well, that's a long time ago. Talk about living in the past. I hope this is not the first thought for it to bring it in. By the way, speak at that highly apart. Yeah. Remember that campaign? I think you were sure working with that poem when Carter was running opposite highly and they were like trying to stay in business highly, et cetera. And I have took their side of course because I don't know why. And Bill Carter and I were out there at highly and we're trying to get people to come there in our audience. I never forget one day I go, I don't want to go into it. It brings me right back to where I was before. You know, I'm just not going to do that no more. Some old fact getting all emotional about some, you know, young straight guy, you just can't do that anymore. It's a bad mistake that some of us make over an over an over again and get all emotional. There were some really hot young guy there at highly and even to this day, you know how many years ago it's about 100 years ago. I still remember right now. I have a retention in my mind for a pretty face like you wouldn't believe. And I'm sure you do too. Yeah. I'm just not the same faces. That's right. I hope this isn't the first vote forward to bringing big developer to that property. Whereas in my, I'm really herraris said at the Tuesday night meeting. Highly of park race track owned by the anxious, the marginal John Brunetti has experienced the febodies after losing its state license, so his horse races. The race track has noted a full season since May of 2001 causing the park to go vacant and be on kimpton appearance. In the past, Robayina has listed the park as a possibility for a new baseball stadium for the Florida Marlins. But yesterday said the purpose behind the council's action was not related to the prospect of stadium deal, many other development deals, and that's a damn good thing. Because if anybody thinks that people are going to go to highly as a large baseball or racer or anything, they're dreaming. Am I right? Right? Absolutely correct. I'm going to dream world man, living in the past, the distant past. You can't, you can't go back. There's another thing say, can't go back. That's what they say. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, I want to see these phones crank and run just laying on the floor waiting for that knock on the door, which we got about 2 and a half hours, 2 hours and 12 minutes, 40, 2 minutes. 26, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, I think it'll run. Probably the real monster guys in our crowd are busy shaving their arm prints right now. I don't see any calls on the board. It was one flash, which I was going to take. I see none. I see zero, zippity, new guy. So maybe we'll play Al Jolson for about 45 minutes to let the package show up. Thank you. What do you want to happen about? Good format. Come in to Q, weigh in. Hello. Okay, that's it. That's the living of our call right there. We want the callers back. They all, yeah. Even though they're out around today. How do you want for it? Is that board? Have you heard that audience? The people that kept saying that. They must have a short memory. A short memory? Uh-huh. Well, we'll see. Let's see how that pole is coming. 1,000, 4,000. Oh, look at that. It's not even 11 o'clock. We got 1,000, 4,000. And you put that on your kind of delayed last night. That is a really nifty need there. Whatever. Rick Shaws retiring. When should Neil retire, that's our question today. Whenever he feels like a 491, never a 405. Now, see, you put those two together. That 89%. Seems like kind of a self-serving pole to me, doesn't it? Like, kind of like, you're bending over and looking your own behind. Seems like an excuse for a pole so that, you know, you got to say, but good one for the next day. Return now, 54 or 5.3% say, retire. Now, instantly. They even finished the show today. Okay. Boy, it is clammy in here. And that's because it's like 60 degrees. I wear crackle window. In a few years, you ought to return 35 soon, 10, like maybe by about 115. And I hate this pole. I'm going to return 0.8% of number. Joel Fimer can easily and well relate to. I believe it. Oh, here we go. And you're, I know you're going to be right. You're going to say, yeah, do what you're so who cares? WDQA, I'm hello. Neil, got? Yes, sir. How you doing? I'm doing great. Um, two things real quick. One thing I love on your website is the cartoons. And I know there's no way for you to track that. But I always scroll past all the bedtime stories because they're pretty insightful. But um, didn't know if you'd sort about the new. I know the Beatles were more tired, but they got this new CD out called Love. And it's fantastic. Is it? Check it out. Well, what does it consist of? I mean, are they singing from the grave? I mean, what do they put on it? Now they went back and it was before George Harrison died. And they got the, uh, it was, they're put on a sort of dysolation out in Vegas. And so they set it up for that. It's like a, it's a really good, needle mix. Man. You know, just when you thought there was nothing more. Here's another red dead Russian. The problem is through Igor Aguida, I felt ill day after with the other guy died there. I've been up poisoning them all over there. That's a coincidence. And uh, the problems in these really are very good with poison. They're very, uh, a lot of expertise. I'm sorry, go ahead with the Beatles, yes? And uh, more Josh and last George. Okay, thanks. More Josh and last George. He wants you, Josh. He's obviously a big fan. See, but now if you heard this a love thing, this being a love. No. I mean, I know I like to be. Let's just find love some of their stuff. Like the White Album was great. Mm-hmm. Not that old stuff on Capitol, like you're playing right there. It was kind of the most of it pretty marginal. And some of the really read-a-l's stuff like on Swan Records is really cheesy and corny. And uh, sembler could be cordoned through a strainer. No, that was not the metal. That's okay. That's enough. With a freaking Beatles already. Okay. The Beatles. If you want to hear the Beatles turn on red shell. I'll play all the Beatles you want. Okay. In his final days. I'll be a good autobiography. The final days of Rick Shaw. I don't mean like final days as far as on the planet. I got a message on my space from Rick Shaw. If you proud of that. Yeah. And I sent him back a message saying, hey, you old fart old geezer. Something like that. Because he's older than I am. He's about to only guy know who's older than I am. I mean, there are a lot of people who are older than me, but I don't know any of them. You know what I'm assuming by that? Mm-hmm. And I don't want to know old people. If I want to know old people, I'll go look into mirror now. I was thinking about the instance and it would buy and I think about all those comments by me about the old Farts. Which I don't apologize for any of them because they were all active with the old farts in South Florida. But now I'm an old fart myself, but never like those old farts, you know? Is nothing like a old fart choice. Oh, God. There's the room in about two seconds. It will must be a old fart. Wow. People run a scatter. They scatter after they think you splatter. But does it matter? That really? I don't know. Let's continue with the story. I suppose you don't get any fatter. And I'm better not. One ninety-two this morning. I'm proud of it. I'm skinny and proud. One. I'm going to continue losing it. I'm losing it. I'm losing it. I'm going to. Until I look just like Johnny Deff. All right. So I got a lot to lose, I guess. The turn. What would be wrong? Would look like Johnny Deff and having his money. I got a little money. But I'm like a child's play compared to a guy like that. I'm a piker compared to the big busted Johnny Deff. You can even begin to imagine the kind of money that that punk has got. They used to sleep in his car in Miramar. And it was on my show on Zeta. You know, that's got to be that chick from Homster. The one that's some successful Johnny Deff. What's your name? I don't know. You know what I'm talking about. You have sex. The jerk knows that's the sentence. Facts is about to end up in Chicago. He calls yesterday and like, oh, did you really have Johnny Deff on your show? Yeah, I did. But that's like 20 years ago for crying out loud on any 19 years. The Zeta days. And I notice I don't get any my space stuff from that crowd from back then. From all those Zeta listeners. I don't get any of that. Or nothing. That's not the best one. I don't want it. I don't want it. What do you want? What? But you know, like complaining about what you don't get. Yeah. I said, I noticed. I wasn't complaining about it. Now I was complaining about it. I was complaining about it. If you're going to be a judge, I said, I noticed that they're not on it. I kind of warned it. Yeah, you're so poor crap, man. Let me ask you out. Let me look at my bank thing here. Oh, I see that I haven't done it. No, it hasn't gone through yet. I gotta go make a real quick phone call. I think I hear it knock on the door. I stuck my mind in there. You know what I see, when we be the first time either, and the check, too. 10, 55, at 5, 60, WTM kind of an incoherent Thursday. There was Thursday and that's because it's the last day of November.

What do I know? Well, how would I know? I don't know you know nothing from Espanyol. You probably like it from Republican- do you have any comments? I'm like that. Yeah, they don't speak Spanish. What do they speak? Dominican? Dominican? Dominican, I think. Okay. I think that's what the month speak is Dominican. Latre, Republican, Dominican. I just like saying that. Just making it makes your mouth tingle. You know? Like you're having some kind of a sexual experience in your mouth. I shouldn't have said that to you. It's so sorry.

First bottle, Jolson Rocks. Yeah. Jolson is a, uh, Alta Cacher who's a real rocker. You're right. Neil. I, um, I was curious about something that about horse racing. If I get asked you really quickly, I'm not a gambler. I've never been well, I've been to horse race once. Um, and people that enjoy horse racing, are there any people that actually enjoy the horse racing because of the horses because of the beauty of them? Or are they all just for fun? Jane to brain out. Well, let me ask you this. I want you. I've got the, uh, in fact, I got a right here. I'll put it on. I might TV. I got the air racing network. H. Schroat. I could open up an account and then gamble online or on the phone. I guess that not how it works. I don't, uh, I'd be broken if I did that. I have to be a crazy person. But I enjoy watching them just because I love horse racing. And I'm just racing especially. I'm just going to ask this question to Hank and who called me basically everything, but he did call me a pervert. I think. Why is that? And even after he hung up on the wall. Why is that? Because you're not a degenerate gambler like he is. I enjoy gambling too, but, uh, you know, I'm not kidding. He's not on an honor. Call him in on the bitch him out about it. Don't be playing that games, Mr. It's the same old stuff. This is the reason with the calls. You know, like a bunch of little kids in the sandbox. Well, I call to Hank and he's going to call him back and bitch him out. Cuss him out. Take it up with him. I'm not going to be knocking the hump right here. How? Huffers good people, you know. He's like a hell of a job in the morning there. But then who expected that was funny. Nobody expected any big number there in the morning. He's not a morning guy for a quiet lot. When you weigh 800 pounds and they have to get you out of the train. How can you do it early morning, show right? Right. Exactly. That's what you said. When you stir with that barber star crab, you are so you are just relentless man. Once you get going boy, just keep digging like with mow for example with a checkered pants and with the bad to pay. All of which was true in the dingo berries. That's right. Driver Robert Venick for a self desire with Brad Paul. Oh, there's Marty Andler. When's your raceway? Marty, who kind of fumfies his way? But is a good guy. Good Jewish boy. Marty Andler. He fumfies his call of the track of every race. But he's a good people. And we call this that day on the air boy was it, boy. Mm-hmm. WKWAM Hello. Oh, I'm Kaleel. Yes, sir. You hear about the big concert. I don't know how much interest you'd have in this, but maybe George and some of his chronics out there. Some of his ilk young. In fucker December 10th. That's a place that, Frank's boys playing his music with Steve V. Terry Bosio. Should be a big zoo. Shake up. Alright. You hear that? Frank's that's coming back on these. I think he's what he said. Alright. He's on these app. Yeah. And guess what? The first song is he's going to sing. Hey there. Oh, my mub. It's brown. This thing young, the cue is boy and down. My car is fast. My teeth is shining. I tell all the girls they can kiss my baby. Frank, don't you hear I hear? I'm at the pain of the soup. I'm present sharp. And I'm acting to. I got a cheerleader here once they help with my pain. But they're doing all the work and maybe they're all ready. Oh, speaking, maybe I'll rap her. So last night on your buddy show, you know your old buddy with the suspenders in the bag. The hunchback of CNN. Anyway, he had something. It was the last night of the night before. I don't know. He had some chicken there who got raped. He was the a place kicker for Colorado. I don't want to say the wrong university. Was the university in Colorado, John? Yes, it was. And she alleges that she got raped by one of the team members. And this is a lot of back. She's written a book about it. And she went to New Mexico. And she's kicking her ass off there for random Mexico. And she's not getting raped at no mal. How do you like that? She was kind of, I don't know. I don't want to see kind of strange looking, you know. And of course you probably think it right off the bed. Oh, she's a football lady football player. And that means she's a dyke, you know. You know what you're thinking? Yeah, I'm thinking that. Of course that's what you're thinking. Because that's the way you guys think that's all you know from is this one's a dyke. Like right shot once said about my show. See the way you guys think. What? I'm just like, guys. How about everyone? No, I don't care what she did. I'm just like, right. What do you mean? What do you mean? She was the hottest thing going. And she was the dyke. And you'd probably be happy about it. I don't want to see the videos. Sure, I'm going to go on you. She's here doing something, you know. Whatever. I'll give it a watch. Maybe she's in the carpet cleaning business. Maybe. Maybe she doesn't have any. 1044 on the polar. 144 votes, man. We are really off to the races today speaking of whatever this guy. You know, I agree with his point. But so Hank is into the gambling and it's okay. Hank doesn't want to watch the races without plunging his guts out. He's a gambling kind of guy. That's his bag, man. That's his big fat bag. And if he doesn't watch it, pretty soon he's going to be wearing a bag. God, when I saw him on that breeder's cup day, I thought I was going to scream at the TV. Lose some weight. You know, losing ounce. I mean, when you're like on the precipice of like you're exploding. You know what I mean? Just losing ounce. I mean, he took up my whole 46 inch screen and then an in some. What is it, Toshiva? I don't even know what I got anymore. Toshiva, isn't it? Okay. I mean, I stand on the side. I was going to say sorry. I don't know. You think I sit there looking at whatever the brand is and the thing. It's a beautiful thing. And especially in HD, which Josh can tell you all about that. He won't buy it that said, but he'll think about it. In fact, when you cast that check, you could use that. That would go a long way to buy in George. His Christmas gift would be a nice 52 inch same song. Yeah. The LP. You know what that would be. Yeah, I don't have my own Christmas gift. That would be nice. Yeah, that exactly. Oh, be beautiful thing. But nevertheless. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Come on. Let's keep these great calls. But when I see how long the audience can keep it up, although we got this first. The BBC reports that an anti-smoking guru has helped many of the smokers kick the habit is died from. Guess what he died from? Cancer? Long cancer. His last words were, Alan Carr 72. I wonder if he's kind of Joey Carr. Maybe he's into dining and dancing. Alan Carr 72 quit his 100 today. I have a 23 year zero. 100, Faggot's a day. Even I can't hear that. I'm bad. You would. Yeah, if I could. All the venue what they looked like. Yeah, line him up outside the door. And let me start right now. Maybe there's that knock on the door. Oh, what are they knocking with? Quit his 100 today. Have a 20s years ago before going out and become a millionaire by advising people how to stop smoking. His books about the easy way method had become international best. Sheldon's. He ran clinics all over the world. When he was diagnosed with a disease, Mr. Carr said he saw his illnesses. Wait, do I encourage more people to quit? Talking of the time when his diagnosis, Mr. Carr said since I stopped smoking more than three years ago, I've been a happy spend in the world. I still feel the same way. He's been told that he's cured at least 10 million smokers as a conservative estimate. How do you like that? Mr. Carr, who died of this home near Malaga in Spain was diagnosed with an operable uncancer in the summer. Friends said it was possible that the years of he spent curing smokers in smoke filled sessions at his clinics not a contributed to his illness. Although might also be linked to his previous heavy smoking. It was a heavy duty smoke. Don't do as I do. Do as I say. It make me a lot of money. So I can die a horrible horrible death. And they can have a long queue to my throat. We've all seen those things where people are so addicted to the nicotine that even they're dying from lung cancer on their deathbed. And they have to okay queue. So they can inhale the nicotine through the hospital cigarette holder to design just for them. In fact, it's the FDR cigarette holder. Mr. Carr himself was convinced he would have died many years ago. Is it the appang one cigarette holder? I'm not really sure. I'm going to say worse. Mr. Carr himself was convinced he would have died many years earlier. If he hadn't kicked the smoking habit, he said, given that I'm informed that I cured at least 10 million smokers, even if that's the case it's a price worth paying. Now, there was, he was willing to give his life so that others may live. Do we believe that? No, sounds good though. And that's how I'm great. Yeah, sure. Why not? Like Jesus, he was kind of like the Jesus of the smoking field. He gave his own life so that others could be cured. And could be saved and go to smoking heaven. We're at smoke free by the way in heaven. You think they're smoking in heaven? Yeah, a lot of Marley is a healthy two there. He gave up a county to set up his first clinic in southwest London, 19th, three a sin set up 70 clinics and 30 countries. How many? About 35,000 people last year. His first book, Alan Carr's easy way to stop smoking, has sold more than 7 million copies. So, Lebanese have benefited from Mr. Carr's method, including Seranthony Hopkins and Serritchard Branson. Guys with some serious bucks. John Dicey worldwide director, Alan Carr's easy way. So, the fact that a former hundred of they smoke or having quit in his middle late, lived at the rightful days of 72's hit from endless massaged all smokers. It's a massage that kind of what's his name wanted, where we're in the 10. Alan Carr's refreshingly different approach to stopping smoking, we're in the position as the world's leading expert in helping smokers to quit. And but it would be for the book for the above. And now he's dead from lung cancer, he shows the shirt. In fact, isn't that the legacy you left behind? Just like Dr. Bob McIntynt, his legacy was don't slip and fall on the icy sidewalk. Which we have that here tomorrow. And if the dam, and I see how psychic I am? What did I pull out yesterday? And don't get smart. You're radial, you're still built by the way. I like tracks walker that you sent me. Walk confidently on packs and then when I say, this thing has been sitting over here on top of my old computer ever since you said it to me. Because I had a need for it. It was just that one icy day. Right. I did it good morning. And now we got another one. Maybe come at tomorrow. Ice and snow, traction, baby. Get some action and then get some traction. And you don't have to take them off. If I was here, the action is probably good to have a little traction. The biggest name. So, best challenge with this is the O'Rotters. More radio 560. You a damn. Yeah. A one moment please. One moment please. He's in the second. He's in the second. He's in the keyboard. The best challenge. He's the big old land of L.C. Gary Mornings 5-7. Walk with ball and 60. Q-A-M. Were you drudge back in? I don't know. Where are we beetle intensive once a day? We had a wide rail, and we knew the show was for my bike in the past. You have to get off your bike ass for that. Q-A-M. Now please, restore our constant two shows As we move. Q-A-M. And here this is the right back. Now that we got rid of the neocon-round shirt, joked. The demigrants better sit down and get to a two-way. And I was going to be a man. A man, a man, a man, a man. I've been in the station's daughters, you get free from it, it's blue. And they made a statement around the world. Q-A-M. They made a song for your schoolers. I could play a tool. A pale body of the different paths. Now get a bull nose, a random oddish case, green. You got it with beach to make the job of peace. And if that's with all the beach, I'll grab. You're next to us, have we meet? Oh, fast, oh, fast, oh, right, man! On time, those acted up and fly, which is now she's running for president. Any chance? No chance. You know what? His big claim to be the famous. He signed a lot of the mid-English-Defish language in Iowa. How many are none of these being, except for those illegal-and-messicans? One of their hushie, highway? How many people, no-spigeting ways in Iowa? I like demoing. I was moans. Huh? I don't know. You know, you wouldn't. Maybe a couple? Here's a fact, dear George, hope this isn't repetitive, but yes, they show us messed up on your archives. And but you're part- I guess it doesn't matter how many times we explain to those people that we have nothing to do with the internet stream. Or can you suggest how I can slow down and fix the chipmunk speed? Just enjoy the chipmunk. So, okay, Alva always did. And so, did David Savilla. P.S. can you guys play the bit where we turn or rack over to the Iraqis? When I think, I'll see, is that called, how will we know that? No, racked up. So, what's it called? I don't know what it's called, but it starts like, and now, you know, it's one of those. Oh, well, I'm here. No, we can't, because we don't know what it is, right? Thanks again, you guys are the best, which we say, yes, we are. Yes, we are. We are absolutely are. And we don't know nothing about the internet stream. We got no control over that, and leave us alone already. And I'm waiting for that knock on the door, and I'm distracted, because I was busy reading and responding when the email, which is probably the most important thing of my life. Well, not the most important thing of my life. I'm just waiting. Eating an email. All right. I'm shooting, in fact, I'm shooting my cut on it right now. Thousands of people say, well, at least, you know, it was indicated that there wasn't a total waste of time. Take back what I said before, Miguel, you're the best. Just leave me alone. Rick Shaw's retiring, when she had near retirement, at a thousand 73 votes, man, we are cooking with gasoline, man. We're cooking with gasoline. Careful where you're sticking. Whenever he feels like at 5, 16, 48 percent, retire whatever to hell and move structure. You'll fart, you old goat. Never, 442. Put those two together, and you got a real kissy kissy man, 80 and 9.1 percent. Is that impressive or what? No, you're not impressed by anything. Even you're impressed by that. Huh? Now we should retire right now, 58. That's not a 5.4 percent. Well, if we can get that down, how about around the 5 percent? Well, I'm going to feel really good about it. Or I? No. I don't care less. Why do people say that? By the way, I could care less. I couldn't care less. That's right. You're right. For one, let's say, do. For one sin, my life, see George finally agree with me. One son, one thing, I find I got some right. But everybody says, I could care less. Well, what does that mean? Somebody said it. Or somebody will say, I did so and so and then so and so and so. Well, so didn't I, so didn't I or so didn't so. What is that? For once in my life, it's Stevie Wonder on Motown, baby. Crank it it out. What about here, Stevie? Right over here. I'll not that way. Turn your head. Okay, it's. See that Ricky. I can do those talk ups man. I'm going on magic. I'm going to crack out the oldies, baby. I'm going to show that Ricky Tickie Shaw thing or two after 100 years of money. And he's good people. But anyway, I started to say before and then you interrupted me with all the other cocker right now. I could start to read net the very important email, which I found some astonishing things in her, by the way, some pretty interesting stuff. Wow, is all I can say. But nevertheless, I'm not going through that on the ear again. It's a bad idea. What was I going to say all about what's his name? I thought you were talking about people who say stupid crap. No, that's not what I said. I could care less than you were going to say. That's not what I was saying. That's all. Nothing. Nothing. Five point four percent say retire. Well, I'm going to go to the door any second and you'll hear that L.J. Music. And if it's a different package, if it's a big man with $10,000, then I will retire. If somebody wanted to write me a check right now for about five minutes, I'd say, okay, see, I mean, I got a couple of bucks to ask to leave. You me. Believe me when I tell you. But then when you've got to support the whole universe, you don't have to, but because of the fact that I'm such a wonderful guy, as you know, is probably even that people see people project an image on you like you're really a hard ass and you're a real bastard and stuff like that. But I happen to be probably one of the nicest people who was ever born. I asked me and I'll tell you. I just personally know. I noticed Josh didn't chime in in there. Yes, I am. He ought to be because he even cashed that check yet. You're very nice. Yeah, nice. Nice and then most people think. But it's a really show. It's a really, right? I don't know. Get too carried away. Okay. You're not my type of sweetheart. Don't worry about it. But it's a bit too much. I'm not worried about it. I'm not worried about it. Not on your life. It's not your favorite. But you're the best. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Starting with my wife. Listen, I got the people that I'm obsessed with and case you have an notice and they know it. And that's probably the only thing. It's part of the fun of life. That's right. George would say it's cute. Like those pretty quint pictures in disappearing. You just climb Jacob Flatter. I would like to. But that's beside the point. I'm going to have. We just stop at this crap already. Please. Well, I didn't see that movie. Did I? That was a really strange drive twice to see that movie. I'm really glad somebody ruined it for me. Well, and I was at a bug. I know I seen it. He's dead. No, what was it about? That's it. I just told you. No, seriously. What was the movie about? He's a... It's Tim Robbins in a car and polluted bunch of visions and you don't know what's going on. And at the end, you realize that he's dead. That's why you don't know what's going on at any point. Another one. He's climbing on Jacob Flatter. Tim Robbins. Oh well. Is he Bobbin with Robin? From that point. Robbins. See more. Why sure was she ahead of ability to put that stuff back on here. But I don't want to have fixed it come up here in posky round my equipment. You know, it's how well it works. I don't have any pots here where the mic doesn't go on and off and stuff like that. Work out and they like that? Yeah. I don't have that. Anyone on the Y-Cuz there's nobody here to screw around with the equipment. That's the main reason why everything here stays in such a pre-mo condition is that it's a beautiful little studio which I wish somebody had said you a picture of. I have that camera in there that digital camera. Yeah. You know that we have the mice face page. I could probably start putting stuff on there. Now that we have faith. Right? As if having your own website wasn't enough of reason. Yes. Now you have mice case. Well, what do we want to put on our website for? Listen. The website is who can let tools be free. Our website is who want to see naked pictures of ready quinn and stuff like that. And a bunch of boobies on it. Now the boobies are one of my space page. We got the sliding boobies to slideshow. And now of course on the phone we got many boobies but that's beside it. And you know what? Who cares? Right? Who cares? So what if Fath boys and out selling anything he's busy potking around with his show? It's part of the course. He's obsessed. He's obsessed. And if you were fat as he is in on a way out, you probably find some of the hobby too. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 60 leverized and sing it around the slime. I've got to get back into swing of the way I used to do this thing. And I'm not going to sit here in pump and hope for a lot of calls all day. Because that's not going to happen. They never could do that for years now. Once the phone died, you know, they can't keep it up for four hours. So I got my own personal pile here. You know, there's nothing I have in a personal pile. I'm here and you're not going to die by the way. So I'm 25. It's almost 11.30. That's three out two and a half hours for them to show up with a damn package. Thank you. Thank you very much. And the damn part of it is I've got to pay them 65 hours and 55 cents. Which, thank God, I got the right change. 65.55 for some crap. What does it say on this thing here? What's the brokerage COD do? What does that mean? Brokerage COD my ass. 65 hours and 55 cents. Wow. Yeah. Your mama. The whole damn thing is only cost 125. I've got a bunch for the machine. I got to pay half that much for the freaking plus you had the postage that was paid on to send it here. And you're talking about the same party was the name of machine. Crying out loud. That's the problem you have with. And the only reason I'm getting it is because I'm not, don't have confidence in these brothers. Fact machines. He's 48 hundred. They're good. I like them a lot. But they die. Like the other one died. So, every message number so-and-so, call brother and throw this thing down the toilet. You know, it's funny. It's funny to die. That's right. Just like Richie. What was his name? Richie Lopalata. Richie Karen. Richie Karen. From your name. Right. Who called us down here? Well, somebody put him up to call on the right. Am I right about that? I said, yeah. Get the honey tune. Yeah. Yeah. Which he didn't really say that in the movie. Am I right? That is correct. Get the honey. It didn't say get the honey tune. You're honey. And no, don't say it. Get the honey. Yeah. Can I have a little honey in my, what was it? A little language, lemon, little lemon. A little fresh lemon, squeeze it by whatever they were going to. Yeah. Whatever they were going to. That's right. And then they started with on the storm. If you haven't seen fast so by the way, this weekend, if you really bored to death, go out and rent or buy or steal a fast so, with done to a reason and bankrupt Rotten stars in it. And it's great. And especially if you're fat, maybe it'll shock you back in a little sense of reality. You know what I mean? I'm talking to you. You're going to have a virgin death. That's right. Like the humper? You need to sit down and have a chat with that fat man. I'm telling you right now, it might be happens. There's neals as if you don't quit eating all that crap you're going to die. And he'll look at you in life as an assault. He'll go just like, what is like that then? And then he'll go, I'm dying on the head. I'm dying on the head. Seriously, he has bigger than some apartment conferences I've seen. I ain't looking pompot-o-beach. I just can't believe it. He took up my entire screen and then was like, slopp it over the edge. And that's your fault. I don't use fault that is that's current's fault for sticking his ass on there in the morning. Because you know when you're up early in the morning, then you got the horse that they did do one thing. You know what that is? Eat. That's it. Eat. And eat. Mind. Jaman. Jaman.

I'm not going to, I'm not going to mess around with that 200 level ever again. Remember I've been going to the farm for a couple of months now. I've never gone over 200 pounds again. Good guys. So last thing I can do a faddle, dying guy, a bit of like me. Man I want to, you know, and I should have the lesson of LASTER should be sticking to my mind shouldn't it? Yes. Isn't that what that stands for when you run lying, you know, LOL lesson of LASTER? Yes. Right. I should let that be real listen to me. You know, guy with his kidneys have gave out and his heart and his, uh, had a chop off part of his foot and then he died. Much much sure prematurely. And by the way, there's a classic example I mentioned this year that I'll say it again of idiots out there, mean spirited rotten people who after he the guy dies, they go and post comments on his blog there, Rob. I'm glad he's dead and you was right. I like that stuff like that and his poor wife's got to read that crap. Don't do it, Mary. Shut that baby down. Right. Please. See this business about people about it and that's another thing. After reading some of that swirl on that my space that's the part that bothers me. I mean, you know, I can communicate with whoever I want if they act, you know, if they pop up on air like recently or whatever, I can do that at my own whim. But these comments from these wise outkers, I feel like I see, you know, falling to the, what was that thing about public opinion, caving to the public, the president of the tide of public opinion, whatever my thing that tells again. I'll do whatever it hell I want. How do you like that, schmuck? Here's what you got. It's probably making like 75 cent now or, you know, shoveling a horse crap at the track or something. And he's giving me a saw in an answer about caving in a public opinion. I'll do whatever I think makes the show listenable and good and fun for all of us. Okay. I like the bedtime stories, but it was a lot of work, man. Sitting here, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. What is the door, I think? No, not. Let's be banging on it. Speaking of radio, move over Warsh Limbaugh says John Bernan. What is this from? I'm something on it. Who don't even care as words from anybody care where it's from. Do you care? Who's known, Bernan. Some schmuck that writes for Warsh Story. I don't like that. Move over Warsh Limbaugh and children's largest progressive talk radio host. Oh my god. As moving head to head with Warsh Limbaugh sometime in December, industry and service from middle of the deal tell Raj Story, the move which puts children the choice known to 3P and window will also bring face to face with error America's flagship talker, Al Franken. Yeah, I'm fine. He's the, what does it say? Their flagship talker, Al Franken. For the flagship station, two radio and siders who spoke on condition of that anonymity confirmed the move. Both character rise the decision to move the inch old silver from drive time to early afternoon. It's one intended to bolster a rapidly growing national audience and Schultz's kick an ass baby. So we not only have to contend with Rush and with all the other swill that's on there which we kick their eyes all the time not a regular basis. But nobody writes about it. Is now we got to put up with Ed Schultz, who sucks. The decision to move Schultz to noon time Eastern could put another Nagle in the coffin of very America which father bankruptcy October 13. A 2006 survey by talker's magazine Peg the Fargo Talker's Listness ship at 2.25 million tying Schultz at number 10 Among Radio Host Nationwide. Eramerica's Al Franken ranked number 12 on the audience at 1.5 million. These guys have talked in millions of people and I'm sitting here I, you know, didlamitonels in South Florida in the land of the walking dead. But you know something in no complaints. Norma can't do in a heck of a job. Especially talking about Clarence and his Q to ask, you know, the important issues. Limbaugh still dwarfs all liberal radio host and popularity with an estimated audience of 13 and a half million ditto heads idiots morons. According to the talker survey down from 14.75 million in 2005 he's down a million. You don't think it's so as pills do it. Sean Hannity pulls him roughly 12 and a half million more Lemmings. A spokesman for Schultz said he couldn't come out on the report but confirmed that a major announcement would be made on he showed today. Schultz is expected to announce the change on today's program which they just got through right now they write it again just to make me look bad. It doesn't get much more raw than raw story. I'll tell you that. Of course some people like it raw. You don't see it? What I hear. Like that. What is that? Appetizer that raw beef what are they calling? You know I'm talking about. I'm like in French restaurants to have that. And even raw. Oh geez. Geez Louise man. I worked in a French restaurant and I don't know what you're talking about. Well so was that you worked in a French restaurant? They give you any females? Of course. Are they still in business? Yes they are. What a happy you get fired. I was in my high school. I don't work there anymore. What did you do there? I moved out of this washer. I was a bus boy. Oh you were a bus boy. Well I'll be there today. French restaurant. Then you got a job as a bus bench. Now how about the escargo? Do you need any of the snails? Love the escargo. Sure man. Oh yeah. Looks like some kind of a seed food delicacy but it's not. The end Schultz show is all by product first to company held by former Fair Channel executive Randy Michaels. Oh that clown. Oh my god Randy Michaels. I'm a man in a radio industry. Just ask him. Product first president, Stuart Crane, Urs Rao vice president of ABC was among those who helped pivot limbo out of the national stage. Schultz's chief competitor of scarrermarica is threaded rocky water since his launch in 2004. Since its inception. Wow. The privately owned company is lost more than $40 million including 13 million in this year along the corner of the network's bankruptcy finding. Schultz's show also privately held is not supposed profit figures. I'm saying you want to think nobody ever lost money on this show so maybe the people over there at IODs. They could make money with a haliboss standing in the middle of Jerusalem for Krenner. That's how desperate those bastards are. And the only thing they could do is they took all their stations in Trinidad with Jubox speaking of Jubox. That's all they know how to do is put on a Jubox. Whether it was the coast or a hot 105 and they're doing very well. EDR. They bought that piece of crap. They're jamming it. I should be saying that because all the punks they want here that crap. Another one here is Snoop Dogg. Here about his latest bust. Do you know we had a big bust? That's what I heard from our name. I heard from our name Drugs. Yesterday. All them drugs man Snoop Dogg. It's going to put him in real deep sur as deep doo-doo. Let's see. Rich Ross return. When should he over here? Look at that now is up to 5.7% 60% for out of 11.19. I've to almost 6% retire. Now retire. I'll think about it. I'm going to think about it very seriously. If they don't come out of that knock on the door for the damn soon. See, this is what, that's why the dial mat for this thing is so unusual. Because they give you like a tour on window. I'm not doing another spot for them. I'm just telling you. I'm actually sure I've been at 2 hours. But here's this thing that gives you like between 10.30 and 2. I'll probably sure if I could 1.58.30. As I'm playing the final dying bit there. I've final dying bit. What would I be something if I died like in the middle of a bit? I never came back. I would do something. I'd play a play. I'd play man. Or maybe I should just play dead. What do you mean you'd play manny? Manny, what? Manny from Kindle? Manny from Al Jolson. Oh manny, I think he said manny. Yeah, I'll play manny from the morning show. Pizza and liquid. Pizza? Yeah, random. Pizza? Are you done? I'm all right darling. How you? I've got that manny five. Why'd you get fired? You have the critical. Oh, it's still man. Why does manny crank all the station? What is his problem? Because he can. 19 to aluminum at 5.60. He can speak out of a restaurant. It's lobster fest to be fried it through some of the amazing Emile Coast buffet. But when you're just in the mood to shovel that food down. The best Chinese buffet in South Florida's got three locations for you. Sunrise, Pemberpies and Sunhears. There's nothing like it. Everything is crisp and fresh and delicious. And there's enough food there to feed the Chinese army. No less. If they get such a coincidence, of course not. Over 100 different items featured on the Emile Coast amazing buffet. No, a raw meat, by the way. What does that call? Is that carpactu of beef is out there. Isn't it? I don't know what it is. A raw meat. Ooh. Six gourmet soups. New York State juicy and delicious grilled order and cooked by the way. The Emile Coast not raw. And carp primer of sushi, traditional Asian dishes. There's a salad bar and a sea bar. And the dessert bar is really spectacular. Weekends featured a 40-inch mouthwatering chocolate fountain. You can hand dip all kinds of neat stuff in their man. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. You can hand dip your strawberries marshmallows, cheesecake, other deck and treats. In the loads of milk chocolate for dessert. A perfect ending to a big feast at the Emile Coast. And don't forget, you'll never water a lot of there with a headache from the Emile Seekers. They don't use any. No crap. No cornstarch. There's no cholesterol, freaking or oil. And healthy sleeping ingredients going anywhere. And right now, when you go in as a party of four. Ask for the Neil Deal.

It's lofty for us back again at the Emerald Coast. Chinese buffet. The biggest name. This is real Rogers, 4th Radio 560. You a damn. I got your breath, so beautiful. On Monday, November 27th, the interview that was shocked to me. Come on, I said two people like that. It would probably come my hand or something. You can edit this, right? Old Jesus and right, did it. Here's how it happened. It's not like I grabbed a bunch of cares and got into scars and tried to go do. Makes it go. Did I say that aloud? The two rates are ready to begin Monday, November 27th, only on talks. 14th will know, beef tartar. And of course, if we got to hear that from John from Macombia, South Carolina, is it said it has to but I don't know what I'm trying to say. Well, I'm just trying to forget it. Let's have had it. Not too long ago. You have? Yeah. Beef tartar. We had it. Why? We were at a Hungarian restaurant in the Hungarian and said, hey, try the beef tartar. It's really good. It's really good. People at the table had good wash. I had to go get off. Oh, yeah. I love beef tartar. I really hate it that those had all noodles in it. Right? But it was soaring the sky high. To the moon, no less had a little mustard dill sauce, which was great. A little mustard on it. And speaking of eating mustard, I don't know who this is by. It's just I just found this on the internet, which I better find everything on there. I needed the moment until I shut that baby down. Well, the guy's name who posted this Howard Chang. And it says, what do I eat? As if somebody really cares about what Howard eats, but he had things to wear months to know. And of course, I did because I was just looking up for steak tartar. I just to Google it and I came across this rather bizarre thing. He says the answer is relatively simple. I would eat just about anything at least once. Wow. I sure don't go along with that, but nevertheless, the only things that I do not eat are things that my body cannot handle. In general, I don't like things that are bitter, like certain vegetables, sour or too hot. And see, I like like sweet, hot and sour soup. Don't you like that? No. That's one of the soups you'll find at the end of the course. Why don't you like hot and sour soup? I don't like sweet and sour and hot and sour things like that. Well, too bad. Then you shouldn't be working a QM if you don't like sour. Good point. I'm willing to give this about anything at least once chances. It's in fact I look forward to trying them. I never refused to eat something simply because of the appearance. I've never been grossed out by anything yet. Buckle's mixed in gets pretty close, but can't call it food candy. What does buckleys mix you? We don't want to know. If this guy won't, I don't want to find out. This is my favorite food group is meat. My favorite meat is lamb. Oh man, give me some. Give me some. Give me some. Give me some. I'm very happy. I'm a little lamb. You eat it. No. But I'm also very fond of beef duck. Buck is also a guinea in slimy. Although it's sweet. No. greasy. Chicken pork fish. I'll see who to serve. No problem eating in the edible parts of animals. For example, tongue, liver, kidney intestines, heart-drain, bone marrow, sweet bread, etc. And this is the standard meat above. Here's a non-absorbed list of some of these things I've tried. Birds, E.M. Goose, ostrich, pigeon, or quail. This guy ate the quail. Animals that live on land, alligator, bison, caraboude, deer, frog, goat, frog. This guy went to Montreal, ate some frog. Goat horse, rabbit, snail, snake, and worm. Oh, this guy's eaten worms for crying out loud. The seafood, cuddle fish. I don't even know what that is. I've heard it before, but what is a cuddle fish? It's kind of squid. It's kind of a little fish that you cuddle up with. Wait, it's squid. Oh, a nice little fish. Squid asks. Jellyfish? Well, I've seen a few of those. Yeah. lobster, octopus, sea cucumber. What does a sea cucumber? I don't want to know. Sea urchin, shark, squid, and turtle. Oh, a turtle. Like, mertal, the turtle, and this guy's eaten my pet. Yeah, I think when I was a little kid, I had like a little one of those little blue turtles, like you buy in the pet store, you know? Mertal, the turtle. And I don't think it was really dead, but we threw it in the garbage anyway. We thought it was dead. It just wants to get set out for a while. You know how that works, dude? Yeah. Insects, grasshopper, cricket, larvae, species unknown scorpions, and I've always been for new things to try, says this nerd. He says Chinese who none of these are strange to me, though, maybe considered strange by others. Other original food, Japanese Korean Malaysian Singapore, since I grew up in Hong Kong, he says none of these is too unusual for me. Haggis, Scottish. I don't mind what I'm trying to do a bit bland. Haggis is like intestines, isn't it? That is correct with. What does that? It's kishki's baby boy. I do love my kishki. But kishki's aren't kishki's, and not intestines. Kishki is like a vegetable thing in the middle of a, the only, in intestines is the wrapping around the outer edge of it. Correct. It's flavored to- Let me correct. Some little gore like you as you would. I grew in the show, Mr. Al-Timeers. We all threw what kishki is, and I was flavored with beef. I'm sure my kishki's got to take it right now. I'll take it right now. What's the meal? What's that, that two-man-right Lakaretta? Go over there. By the way, we're gonna see Al-Arkaretta. Here's somewhere. I love Las Vegas-Q and restaurants. Thank you very much. I saw Al-Arkaretta somewhere in either here or the airport or somewhere. Maybe in Montreal. They got good restaurants in Montreal, but boy, you sure want to put up with those frogs with those people. And they collect nation, man. Collect nation, my ass. Oh beef, tartar. He says I like raw beef. When I first had in Paris, in Paris, Josh, French restaurant, Paris, I guess I didn't have to go to a nice place, and it wasn't that great, right? Didn't go. Since then, I'd had beef, tartar, and Montreal twice, they were quite good. My role in leftridge also has good beef tartar. In Montreal, I had a twice in in Paris. Sounds pretty French to me. French restaurant. Yeah. See, that's a pump-like Josh. He's a good kid, but he just got a big mouth and talks about it. It's fine. We like that. Yeah, because I worked there, and they didn't have that. So they didn't have it. Maybe it was a crappy French restaurant, okay? Maybe that's why, you know, anyway, Balluth, Philippine. What is Balluth? These are imbianated duck eggs that are hard boiled. Hard boiled duck eggs. You can see a baby duck in there. It says, oh, that's bad. Oh, right at lunchtime, you're doing this to us too. People eat the craziest. It says, Balluth's feet and beaks are crunching, giving you a very nice contrast. Oh, yeah. You can find these at the Asian supermarket in Luford sometime. There's obviously some brick jackass, Luford. Or is that Luford job? Could be Canadian, too, Ontario. Is this guy from my doency? Beef tongue. One of my favorite parts of the cow is there any part I don't like. He says, no. If done right, very tender and extremely flavorful, I think they've sort of flavor very well. Tung. Wasn't your tongue's footsteps, or flavor very well? It's the idea. Few goo, which is blowfish. Pugu. Fugu, few goo. I had this during my trip to Japan in 2005. All the other things have eaten our gross to some people. Only because of what they think, but this one can be truly dangerous. The fish has potent toxins that must be prepared properly. Luckily, I'm still alive. The texture of Fugu is quite firm both wrong. Could live you had this? No, I know about it though. He says, the cook ones have quite a bit entased. It's like Gruper. Be a Trupper and Trassen Gruper. No thanks. That's all. Gruper this quarter. No thanks. Thank you. How is Gruper? Did I already? Gruper? Fingers my ass. I bet they do. In general, I don't like bitter or sour food. It's other than the only category. I'm not so keen on his desserts. What a schmuck. Yes, you're right. It's not the taste, but what desserts do to my body after where the drives me away from the most desserts I made with unsurprisingly sugar. And often contained dairy products in fruits. They make me sick. He said, I can eat a lot when it's something I like. I like in general greasy deep frying food very much, but also like steak, but most kinds of grilled meat. Processed meats such as sausages, corn be, bacon, etc. Also some of my favorites. And this is a simple eating. And in terms of fast food, nothing beats KFC. That's because up until very recently they've been cooking in the deep frying and nasty, heavy trans fat crack and that's true. I can eat it for lunch dinner and breakfast. They used to have extra tasty, crispy, formula and candida. Yeah, less for a giant terrier must be what he's talking about. And what was it that they haven't left for? She said something I don't want to try. I don't want to know. And I don't want to know. He says, unfortunately, it seems that was the only one to order this stuff. The only fried chicken fried the chicken went order it all the pre-cooked chicken with the original recipe. They no longer sell it in Canada. Probably because of a lack of customers. And on and on and here we go. Here we eat anything. I know some guys like that. 1156 votes on our pool. We're in a spruce, some really sensational calls. The case where in case you missed it, you hear any of them? Yeah. No. 1156. What do we got so far? Rick Shaw, an officer's retirement on Tuesday. She said, Rick Shaw is retiring. That's right. So we're going to correctly. We're telling like after the first of year. Whatever Bob Hamilton says, get out of already. Take your camp and get lost. No, but I'm probably going to give a big send off when you think. Just like we get here at QA and big kiss on the yes. Rick Shaw's retiring went to New York retire. Whenever he feels like it, 5544749 percent. That's damn why you're folks. Got it. It's enough to make me pleased. Right now, is that knock out of the door by damn facts my she and man with my package. I think they're jerking you around. Never, 475. Never should retire. 41 percent. Never. Just keep going until you croak right there, man. We'd love to hear that. Now we should return. Now 66 back up to 5.7 percent. That's not a real good design. That's your crowd. They want to hear you. Right. Here's George. Hey. In a few years 40, soon 11. Like a sooner than later. And I hate this pool. Solementate DHC. Soltonto DHC. Soon you missed the languages like that. And I get the numbers and the whole deal here. It is confusing to me. It bothers me a lot. The Spanish and Italian. What about the frog? How do you say 10 in French? You have to be your 12. The most convoluted numerical. This walk I word. Set. Why you say I don't know sex. Seth Seth Greenberg. Seth Greenberg's going to be on. All right. We got several segments with Seth. We don't know what tele does but at least he's Jewish. The biggest name. So best talent for the business. We will rock for sports. For you. I'm 60. You. And. This is Ticini. I like to relax by having very diagonal and massage my balls. I listen to the meal. I'll write this. Okay. Go. Right. If you get in trouble. And things don't go your way. No. If you face a lawsuit. That's when it's not a lawsuit. That's when it's not a lawsuit. That's when it's not a lawsuit. That's when it's not a lawsuit. That's when it's okay. That's when it's not a lawsuit. That's when it's okay. That's when it's not a good spot. You have to speak. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. The. So anyway. I'm gay. 12 or two at five 60 that kind of like. And in nachy leech me against any problems at all rest of my life. blows, but it's a 59 degrees for quite a lot, and it's going to be rain and sleet and snow and freeze not, but to get my cleats on. And we're cleat bore, plain third base for the Yankees. No. Clay, Clay, tourists bore. Bob Geiger writes, and why do people say Clay tourists? And we're kind of a moron says that, you know? I'm sorry, Joyce. She has a real, she's nervous about that. It's shaky. Yeah. This is what she's nervous about. Farce. In fact, there's probably why she farce them, which is because she's nervous. Isn't that what they say about people that were nervous that they far? I've never had that problem. Of course, I'm not a nervous person. I'm a nervous wreck, but that's because I work for this company in this business. But I never really, I don't know, I'm not one of those people at nervous parts. I fart a lot because I'm big and fat, you know, an old. See, when you get older, like you blow them out and you're not even aware of it, you're not even trying. You just hope that it's like, you know, yeah. It's what you think it's going to be. Bob Geiger says day 19 hundred dollars.ama. Well, am I going to start getting back into the business? Well, I feel like I can mix in match. You know what I'm saying? Because it's thought like there's any cause on the board right now. Although once it'll leakage is up, it'll be, it'll be smoking baby. It'll be smoking. I can't tell you what it's going to be smoking. That guy who died with their lung cancer, he'll tell you. Bob Geiger says I usually post the way to stop day to my Osama clock on Mondays, but I just wanted to note that effective today in November 30th, it's been 19 hundred days since top talking George W. Bush city with smoke Osama in a lot out of his hole and Neil and better alive. In the massive universe of Ways, Bush has exploited our nation's tragedy on 9 11, few things seem to have brought him more political capital with American people in his swagger and fake resolve to bring those who attacked us to justice. He's going to bring him to justice and anybody with a brain nose for justice, we got to go see dog collion. That's right. Anybody with half a brain nose, that of course, that leaves your president out. Shmuck. Anyway, he stood on the arrival of ground zero in New York City and said that bad guys would hear us all soon and followed that a few days later by invoking imagery of the old West and saying he would get us some bit of a lot of dead or alive. Of course, just six months later that we saw was gone and Bush Langley said to reporters that good law and just wasn't that important. I don't know where he is said our iron world macho man, you know, I just don't spend that much time on him to be honest with you said. We can tell because we sit here at the 1900 have been law and running free and continuing to podcast periodic threats to our country. It's time where we focus our global fight against terrorism, set it a rust final to remember the Senate Intelligence Committee said in June who must move away from Iraq sentry policies that are draining our resources and focus on our guidance and fully authoritarian, importantly operating in some 60 to 80 countries around the world, you should live so long, Russ. A good way to start my fee for us to actually nab the guy we promised to get five years ago. I work in New York City where Bush made his bull claims and continued it while New Yorkers love tough talk. They have a little respect for people who can't back it up. So you're a Mr. Bush, where in the house of Osama? Hey, you're a Bush. Just like you said, a Tony Blair, remember that when he was a judge, he was cut. Redneck from Texas, some kind of a Yahoo Redneck, Chaan and Chaan with his mom open, like some kind of a clutch. Of course, keep in mind, Danny's the one who liked to give it all over the table with a Japanese there. Maybe they didn't like that sushi, you know? It's possible. Oh God, yeah, as much as I did test 50, I did eating sushi. Oh, something that's stirring back out. Oh, my boss. Brother. 560, let's get our call segment in here. Okay, let's kind of mix and match. Do you think the audience can handle this? No, can I keep up with me now? That's a problem. For a doubt, our gold fart like me, you guys just can't keep up. Of course, the the seven-minute delay doesn't help. 5.5% 66 per sub for what is it? 66 people be saying, right now, right now, before you finish this sentence, right? Just like Howard Beals. Right in the middle of a, remember that? Of course. And you can go to the process because he'll fall asleep by that point in the movie. It turns it off right in the middle of that sentence. Television is not the truth. So turn off your television, said, turn them off. Right in the middle of a set. Like that. That's how I'm going to do. I'm going to go out like, random, like that. Come in your QA and home. Hello. Come in your QA and home. Hi, you doing? No, we're talking about you nervous. I just got out of a nervous hospital over in Hamburg. And so I say, you want what you just really make my stomach nervous with that french fries, haters and biscuits and my okay good. You got out of a nervous hospital. Oh, now you got to see Sling Light. He was doing Carl. First thing. Was he really? I haven't seen Sling Light in the Irgonistic. I was like, that was, that was quite a cute, cute movie. You got out of a nervous hospital, a burn you a copy. You didn't have a nervous hospital in Sling Light? Yeah, he also said, Bob or Ted, two men or not, light together. Nice. 1188 votes on the pool. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. 5, 5, 65, they for rising and the Sling Light line. So I think it'll write us a line. Sling Blade my ass. Okay, I'll go get the knife. Get the rubber band. WQAM, hello. That's rewards. QAM, hello. Remember the rubber band, man? Hello. Come in. Hello. Hello. Hello. Call back at the time. You need to put off. Yeah.

I probably would have voted to retire now, only because you weren't taking call. I'm going to show him was getting kind of... Ponderous. Oh, yeah. I mean, with the reading of the news all day, you were starting to sound like, PAYER, are you good day? Right. You know, the thing that's funny about the calls, isn't the content, it's funny. It's just that they're so bad, you know? Right. It's like a trade bank. That your attempts are 99% of the more 99% of the more 99% of the more, 99% of the more, so lean. That's why I'm doing the show in your mouth. That's why I'm making the big bucks. And you're out there pushing a push card in central park somewhere. Selling a kishki. Oh, I'll take some by the way for lunch. I wish they all I could find a place to take a kishki. I know that place that Remer took me that time, which is out in the end of the world, so why do you keep using these Yugoslavia and words on here? You may even know where you were slavia. 32 AM, hello. 2 AM. Hey, Neil, how you doing, buddy? Very good, excellent. Hey, again, uh, first time, long time. I'm calling to you, is that thing in the meat, the raw meat, isn't it? They tartar. Stay tartar, that's it. All right, man, you have a good afternoon. Thanks a lot. We only listen at like 20 minutes ago, but this guy's busy on the floor. I'm on the computer. OK, just relax. See these things don't drop off under supposed to. I hit the drop off thing. 50 times, oh my god, are we having a technical problem here on this end now? Wouldn't that be bad and unusual, too? I don't know. Had a little bit of that yesterday. Stay tartar. Maybe that's why I'm pukeing my gut, sir. Come in to QA and hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how are you? Hey, you were mentioning, uh, like a red of there is one at Miami International Airport, then, uh, I wouldn't have. I wouldn't need there for you. Well, why me by that? Why is that? Well, I worked there. Yeah, so why should I eat there? Because you work on it. I don't want to hear some kind of crap. You're going to come up with about how they got like, you know, La Carretta. He works there when he got like, yeah, you worked there. My ass, OK. You worked there. It wouldn't like the loser like you come with an 100 yards of La Carretta. No, I'm talking about outside of there. I've seen one. I've seen one. I've seen one. There's some unusual place to maybe it was in Europe somewhere. It was La Carretta. I think it was. Maybe it was an Amsterdam. Oh, you should have won a eighth there either. What I hear from you. Oh, I'm sorry, but it's just, uh, anybody who tells you otherwise, uh, just laugh at him. Just look at him and just fall down on the floor and hold your sides and laugh and giggle and act like some kind of a knit wood. Act like you're having a spastic fit. Because the food and Amsterdam rhymes with the fit. It is inevitable. It's crap. Otters Malaki. As the way he's, uh, clown. 1191 on there and 67 say retire now. Soon that's only number we need to look at. The rest are just looking like he kissing kissing. That's an important number. 5.6% which fits right of an acute 56. See what all fits in together. For that. You're going to be all fine. We're voted on that many times. The biggest name. So I'm saying down with five yards. You're checking for 20560. You A. Damn.nine, eleven to hold your mind.

It saved me a hundred bucks. It's, you know, if I were to miss like a whole bunch of deliveries and had to drive up to the UPS building way, way, way up at the end of the world. Remember that time I had to do that for my Blackbird? That's right. Wow. That was a trip from hell. I thought we were going to the North Pole Land day. Pretty close. U.S. band sale of iPods North Korea. And I just mentioned my Blackbird and here we are with a story about iPods. I like that. I got nothing to do with it. The Bush administration wants North Korea's attention to like a scolding parent. It's trying to make a tougher for that country's eccentric leaders to buy iPods. What if they're talking about Kim Jong-Yu? Yeah, that'll learn them. Yeah. And I want Baldwin. They're making a tougher for that country's eccentric leader to buy iPods, plasma TVs, and segue electric scooters. How can we go on if we can't have our segue? Oh, boy. Have you ever seen anybody on a segue? Sure. We had one for a toy for a while. I mean, not at the house. They made it available. Here at the station, they made one available and I was able to write it around. In fact, for squashed it? No. You think I was going to let him on it? The US government's first step for effort to use trade sanctions. The personally aggravated foreign president and expressly targets that and believe to be favored by Kim Jong-Yu and I, with Baldwin, are mad Damon, are presented by him as a gift to the roughly 600 loyalist families who run the communist government. You'll be very just made by the way. And you better straighten your buddy Miguel out since you didn't want to lose him all the good movies. When he was on their fillet and for you last week, he won the day when he didn't know he was supposed to be working. And we got into a conversation about a team of American world police. He hasn't seen it. Oh, my goodness. And he said, oh, you mean to Walman the puppets? Remember that job? Yeah, no, we will. Yeah, he's hurt. I didn't know that. We'll have to remedy that at ASAP. How can a guy who is supposedly a hipster like Miguel, somebody his age in his realm, not know what they were talking about, a team of American world police? One of the best movies of all time. Well, he's married now, so his life is over anyway. Oh, that's true. You hear that, Josh? Trust me. How did he unless you and my other newfound friend? Oh, I would not let he's this smart enough. He ain't kidding me. Neither are you. Kim will introduce you to a secret nuclear weapons program. It's other options for team in the high-end consumer electronics on the right of them. He wants that the list of proposed luxury sanctions and team-wide news, associated press, aims to make Kim and Swanky life a lot harder, no more coniac, no more world-like swatches, no more cigarettes, no more faggots, artwork, expensive cars, Harley Davidson motorcycles, or even personal watercraft like Jet skis. The new band was sent even the musical instruments and sports equipment. The five-foot-three Kim is enthusiastic basketball fan. Oh, yeah. He must play on stilts.

What is an pathway to the most countries? The new dictators, the big shots, they get all the crap and everybody else still like a bunch of sluppers. That's realistic. That's right. That's exactly correct. She's showing Bush under and saying, I'm realistic. I think that's what we're going to describe him. I'm realistic and also unacceptable to describe the Bush monster. Unacceptable, Georgie, went and doubted, get to hell out. Oh my god, we got two more years and almost two and a year, because it's only the end of November. Lot of strength at the November day.

All the oldies all the time, was good enough for Rick Shaw for 100 years on the year. It's good enough to keep us going for least another week or two. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. 5, 50. Here's the fourth hand, the calls being back in. It's like, you know, slim and grim. A little bit of action over here, a little bit over there, not too heavy duty, you know? Exactly. I think the novelties already worn off, don't you? Orpil what? Then the blooms off the rose rose. WQAM, hello. You have more rooms there, maybe. Last one, WQAM, hello. Hello, I'm Neil the morning. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil, listen. Um, I saw Matt's for the long before you started pitching it. Look at something, what you think. How does they put together that the ring they found in the second stone, the woman, Chris killed. How do they make you really movie for everybody else for crying out loud? Oh, I'm not talking about that. Get out of here, I'm trying to get rid of you and it, they're just dumped a call. Good. He didn't say anything, so it was a ring thing like that. They just, he just brought the end of a very good movie for you that we don't want to do. Am I right? Yeah. And addition, which of these two stupid figures that out, you shouldn't have watched it in the first place. There was nothing confusing about that movie. There wasn't anything any more confusing, then sticking your finger in a deep dark hole. Okay, pal. Nothing confusing at all. Well, that can be confusing. Just pointed and sticking. That's all. And wherever it winds up, just, uh, looking like that guy from, uh, Leftbridge, whatever the hell is story is that goofball. It's eating all the guts. I'll let, uh, haggiest. Uh, 545 votes on a pool. How's that the return out? Doing a good, 70 up to 5.7% excellent. See, they think that's like a shot. I think it's a great compliment. Return out. You didn't have to get lost. Retire. WCWM. Hello. Hello. Okay. Good talking. You too, schmuck. WCWM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, well, you know, you make one of your listeners happy if you die on the earth, because I need you to die and act for your, you know. Yeah.

And then it can like mix them with my two dogs ashes, you know? That quite a cocktail. And they can throw them right there. It's a finished line. It would be good. Or they can sprinkle a line that my favorite, my sheenman. I could machine. They can shake. They can, uh, share some gold, but then I couldn't my sheenman. Do they allow smoking in there? No, they do not. I say no. They do absolutely not. What's to be because then they could afford you into an ice tray right there. And when asked trees are they're going to be born by a second. They're going to throw it. And when asked. We're also going to afford some faddle last into an ass trade. Okay. They would. That's where I'm for. Your ass joys all the way. I don't think we can find an ass trade. Big enough for it. You hateful. But let's talk about back there again. Okay, because I think we got to hurt for your place for the time being.

Subcenter. How you know, Chuck, over there if there's subcenter. You think they listen over there on the corner, cross the standard. I see him almost every morning though. You do you see Chuck? I thought I'm making the turn. He's outside. Is he way back? He's just way too late. Curtis, because he recognized me, my beautiful core vet. He probably doesn't recognize you. No, he's not even looking in that direction. Well, why not? Because he's over on the other corner doing stuff with the store. He's working? I am acting. Or is it supposed to be our similar form of sales people are busy or cranking and show. And then this guy's working. Like a real person.

So the best challenge to the business. We all Roger S. Sports Radio 5.60. You A.M. Fuck it in and hold it. But federal government just learned about those people today. And you're reviewing Finisher's and most parties, Brown, offered no authority. And mostly great others, with a default price, take cost hundreds of dollars. My Brown, there's no one left to blame, I said, Browny. You're the government, shame, I said, Browny. Short careers up in blame, there's no one. I know who's or they enjoyed Bush. We'd better make them shut up before he says. It was you who messed up, you can defend him. But I'm sure you will find many things that he should do time. I was very responsible. I was way too dumb to run the F.E.M.A. Some people die when he ran F.E.M.A. You're a loser. Now that everyone knows that you're leadership votes, you can go back to your harsh shows. Today, both Republicans and Democrats criticize the fact that Brown is still on the federal payroll. That maybe because as long as he remains at his administration official, his testimony. Yeah, yeah, but it'll be quite a good one. About 1245 and 560, every few members, also some goofy thing in my space about Moe and Moe and Moe is on with the who we've got Lamar Thomas's and his own Monday with our sports overgiven morning show. Dolphins Monday, that's Lamar Thomas. Lamar Thomas. He bucked. To rail buckly? Yeah, I want to rail buckly, yes. He was a pretty weak when he played for the dolphins. Who else did he play for? He was pretty good for somebody else and he sucked with the dolphins. But at any rate, you're a patriot. That's right. To rail buckly was with the pay. Who else was with the Thai law? And what's his name? All these guys that we don't have any Wonders Duck kick in this. Now let's see the pay pits and alliances we get to girls team or plan. Where's that game? Is that a game in Fosper, I believe? He tells me, buddy. It's actually a lot of stadium man. Detroit. I don't know. Does it make a difference? Of course not. And the dolphins have a home game in Spiderman, which I was feeling yesterday. They got a home game against the Jacksonville Jail Ures, who are very mysterious man. One week they're really good in the next week they suck and then it's like most of the NFL. It's maybe awkward. You know, they got parody, which means mostly mediocre teams. And then of course it often is a really suck. But they got four in a row, baby. Yeah, you better jump on that dolphin bandwagon. Start pushing it. No thanks. You push like pushing the Thai roll pushguard in the New York. I think we'll all have to make a big trip to Europe to Amsterdam. Do the show from over there. And maybe we can get Bob removed to go back and make an appearance there again too. And it left him right out of town again. What a jackass. He just, he just left the poor engineer over there to pour a Dutch guy. Just left him in the lurch. You just got on a plane and then moved. Remember that call we tried to take that day. We had Rimmer calling. Of course that was a mistake. But you remember that? Yeah. When I was trying to do the show for my studio in Amsterdam. Wow. It was kind of like, oh, yeah. Can you hear me? I was kind of like that. It'll even better. Probably in the 69 votes on the poor Rickshaw as retiring. A legend after 185 years in the business after what? 46 years in Miami, I think since 1960. And Ricky Tickie announced on Tuesday and called us here on a show. If you missed that call, you missed really something. Great news. It was really. It was radio. It was like today. I don't want to say it. When I said it or not, I had that call. I was saying it was that. The call was said in the fact that he croaked is even said or but nevertheless. Now I tell you what the saddest thing is that he's still. He still had that desire to hear from the audience at the end of every month on his blog. He would open it up for comments. He still had that need, you know. And that was disturbing me. I don't want to say it. I didn't like said it. I'm going to say hey, cut the crap because it was his choice. It was his choice. Right. He knew what the kind of crappy was going to get. What kind of goofballs around there. You know, on the one hand, you got the people kissing your ass and on the other hand. Why did you go out with you to serve? I hope you a diet. What could you like that? That's what you got out there because it's Florida, baby. This guy did this UPS delivery guy that just came. I know it's a very minor thing. It's a civil league. But he was so freaking polite, man. He would like a puked your guts to shoot a tape tape. I said, would I have to have to have a pay 65, 55 cent of customs tape. And what I'm, I know what you said. I heard anything. I'm deaf or something for Christ's sake. Just because I'm old and female. I heard what you said. Take to this. Quitter. Tap it right to your. Yeah. Scroat. Come on. We're from 71 votes. The throat rhymes with scroat. Rick Shaw's retiring. What should he over time? Whatever the hell he even feels like a 9. 527.3% that's obviously the only acceptable answer. Who the hell are you? People would be telling me when to return. Of course I asked the question. But it was just a kill. Another day's quarter now. And got so a couple of good polls here. What was that other one here? Oh, I forgot I got it over here in the, that's it. The one from Robbie. He says, I tried. No, I don't feel bad, Robbie. It's a good one. I like that. It's a good poll. And the other one doesn't have a name on it. No. Real men don't eat Adi Adi Adi. Right. That's a good one. So this even if nothing else could happen. I started our live minutes. It's been a banner day for me. My stand by faxed my sheen showed up here. And the guy actually delivered it to my door. And a big, big, heavy duty boss. It's a good thing I have to slump that up here. Although, of course, we got these, you know, what do they call us things? But do they call them? Dallies. We got these. Dallies, baby. Hand truck. Well, kind of like that. No, it's a dolly. Not a hand truck. But whatever it is. So anyway, he slumped their right to my go. So that happened. Get out of the way. A lot of stress. I've changed emails with them when my very favorite people in the world. Even though he doesn't realize it yet, and I hope he doesn't. Anyway, whatever. Rich, boss, retiring, went your meal retire. Whenever he feels like in 503, never, 527. A very close second. Never retire. Just keep going until they come up there and drag your ass out. And they come out here. I guarantee you that I'll have him stop to the border. Any of these going from this company. Now, return now. 74. That's up to 5.8%. Retire. Now. And they're doing that just, you know, just to get in there a little bit. Like I care. I wouldn't care for like 95%. I'll return now. I'll return when I'm ready when I got enough money to go to woodbind every day. And then travel all over the freaking world, you know? In a few years, 45 soon, 13.9. I hate this fool. 11. Soon. Like, what did what it assume mean? I mean, I know I put it on there. This was strictly my pole. What is assuming? I don't know. Like this weekend. No, that sounds like good. I sounds like a plan. A plan of action, man. I don't think so. Santa majority of the day. We had this for you first in the world yesterday because I seen it there on CNN. So they must have a first thing by the good day. What is that bushload of tick? And there's a molecule. They had a postpone of mean till the day because they're trying to figure out what to do with that the Bonnie solder, whatever her name is. Remember Bonnie Tyler. This is Bonnie's side of her sister. That's a crap. All these schmothaids. Baby, schmothaids gone wild. You all got girls gone wild. This is schmothaids gone wild. And then there was actually somebody who was talking. This was most insane. One of the talking head shows there's only 6,000 of every day. They were going out about, well, if they put somebody back in power like Saddam Hussein, he just went through this bizarre trial. They're going to hang his ass. And we went to the supposedly all of this stuff was to get him out of there in the first place. Regime change and weapon demands destruction. And the fact that he was an evildoer in the threat to our society and the whole freaking world. Oh, well, maybe they have to put him back in there, which means of course they share the less of it on in the first place. Anybody would have a brain knows that. He was our evildoer. But what is kind of a religious fanatics? You need evildoer. And they're to keep them all in line. Keep them from killing each other. For murder and mayhem. That's the problem with these freaking ragheads, man. They're out of control. Ragheads gone wild. I think the Pope had a point there when you came right down with. Oh, gee. Can't say that. He had a plot right at the tip of his hand. Oh, he was right. But who's he to talk? Yeah, who now are you to be talking about religious fanatics killing other people. Making him an offer to the camera fuse. Who are you, Papa? I think we need an inquisition over there with a swish guard need to go in there and do what for. Maybe give him a nasty cup of tea. Maybe the Russians need to come in there and show him give him a little instruction out of poison people. Now, ready, poison one Pope not that long ago. But you're not supposed to talk about that. Just watch Godfather 3 instead. Ooh. I know it's a heavy price to pay. I like you see what a bishop goes flying. Oh, yeah, that's going up in here. You see that? The bishop has fated that movie so that all that, you know, the good stuff, the preacher stuff and then edit all the rest of it. I'm in Roth and there. Yeah. When he kept like that, get rid of all that soapy business. Yeah. That post-nacel grips in Rome. It's kind of a Jewish thing. You know, and of course, he's high in Roth. He was very Jewish. So, yeah, it's a Jew thing. I didn't know. Post-nacel grip. My uncle, Hyman, had that thing. Always like that. Yeah. Good guy, but if I drive you nuts. Yeah. Hi. Send him a journey leader, Bill Frissel, he said he won't run from prison. We had that on the air. As it happened, is they were announcing a man ran out of the box and everybody said, what? He will not run from prison as if he had a chance. Of course, and of course this morning, who's the guy for a timeville sack from I went out, he wants to be the president. You know, I want to be Ed McMan and have $50 billion in the bank too, but I'm not. Hey, oh, a high profile campaign draft up more than a year before the first convention delegate said chosen. In the Bible, he said, God tells us for everything there's a season and for me now, this season and being elected officials come to a close. He said, of course he was a surgeon. He surrendered politics in 1994. That's why he was able to diagnose Terry and her cheer by Washington around TV. Remember that? He said, all his balloons are moving. She must be breathing that bitch or something like that. He said he'll take us to medical from public life and we turned to his professional roots as a healer. And to refocus his creative energies on innovative solutions through seemingly insurmountable challenges American face, which sounds like a lot of high-fly and meaningless rhetoric like a bunch of political double talk. Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bb like that crap. L-crapo. First, an ounce when he first ran for the Senate, they retired after two terms. Retired. That's it. Let's take a poll on some other people when they should return. George W. Bush. Now, I bet you do better than that than I did. His decision not to seek the one else. Thus, can't say 12 years, 10 intellectual politics which he rose from an underdog. In his 1994, from an updog, an 94 cent of campaign to be positioned to a majority leader of myriad years later. And of course, you know in every election there's a dog. Among the Republicans already explained what house bedmout we know about. Why do they put this in here like robots at children? Okay, who now wrote this? AP? David S. Bow. Good. God Almighty. Other potential geopolitic contenders include senators Sam Brown back of Kansas. God forbid, can you even begin to imagine that? Rather than. Sam Brown back who's got like a swastika on his forehead and Chuck Hager on the Branska. Chuck Hager was pretty good guy. I'm pretty moderate guy. Much to moderate to get the nomination just like Rudy Giuliani. Governor George Pataki of New York and Mike former governor because he's on the way out. Because Elliott Spitzer is coming in. He's the man in Dark Horse. And Mike Hacker, the Arkansas and Representative Duncan on the California. I'm trying to write now a great ticket will be Barack Obama with Elliott Spitzer. A Schwarzner in a Jew. Winepi Good. Horps for me. Boy, you talk about swimming upstream. I've streamed Democrats. You're good at doing that swimming upstream. I think that's the thing. I like Barack Obama a lot. I'm telling you right now. I think he's got a certain thing. You know, I mean, he's got like a he's got charisma. Yeah, he does. Obama had charisma. You know, that's right. Bush has got the charisma of a dead man. He, you can't complain about his charisma because he didn't have any. I mean, there's one thing that he's got that we all know about. Wait, does he have a lot of cuts by. But no charisma. But Barack Obama just got to ask. And of course, you say, well, what does charisma have to do with the, you know, I mean, there's movie actors got charisma too. Obama Arnold, he's got it. Our California shouldn't have anything to do with it. What else do they have going for? Except he's married to one of the Kennedy. You know, by the way, you're going to go see Bobby neither my. I don't see some fiction about Bobby Kennedy that doesn't have anything to do with the reality about all the extra bullets that they found in the pantry. There are the ambassador hotel and about who we need to kill them. And about, you know, let's get a movie that tells us something about the truth for quite a lot. And so the summer will emphasize BS because the media is the best of his daddy is Martin and she ain't gonna say him from the she and he helps. I like Martin and she. But you know, I'm not going to have him already. I'll tell you one good thing about Martin she and you know what that is? What's that? He's not your clone. The biggest name. So the best challenge to the business. We all Roger's sports radio 560. You A.M. Yes, hey, people that use snappy all-banner is for their show segments like that. One to two hour. Hello, this is Alba's kinder from Tony van Records. And fighting you American infidel, who buy latest cast Stevens collection. And you know my mom it is right. But take your head up your body. Got a machete with the real sharp blade. How I wish I had an American hostage. Make those in and out of the head. I was only shooting distracting. I was on the airplane. And suddenly with the details. They're mad you that I can burn. And wear a towel on my head. I don't know what I know. I'm being followed by an F-16. What do they want with me? The money from your purchase does not go to fund terrorism. Really? It's not time to get off the plane. Just relax and take it easy. You're just dumb. That's your fault. It wouldn't happen if I were a Jew. Find a skin. And a rag. If you want. A-D-Tain. Another variation on a classic. Woo! Woo! Yeah! And I'm myself every day. With some American champagne. Tell me who to harm this lady. Gonna make you never look at her. I'm trying to make her woman. She lived her valent exporter. So by no catch Stevens collection for table 1995. Or do you compare with Visa, Iceland, God, or weapons of nasty drugs? Oh man! That's one of my old time favorites. Not because of the bit itself. But just because of that phony muslim ranting. Which is all Indian Mon. It's all Indian. I think whoever the answer was, they had too much curry. 1305 on the pole. 1300 plus. That's pretty damn good for an old fart like me. I'll tell you right now. We're plugging it along. Speaking of people who are run for president or won't. Guess who is? I don't know. Maybe. Guess who is. Who likes to eat his dummy if the dummy then in Hollywood. Oh, what's his Clark? Wesley Clark said Tuesday wants to avoid waiting till 2 late to make a decision this year. Whether to run for president or staking made in his failed 2004 bit he said. They didn't want you west. It wasn't that you waited too long. They didn't want you. And they don't care for you to go to Ruben sandwich. That sounds really good for lunch though. Although I want you to bread. I will eat the bread. What's the big sentence? The root of pill. Huh? Just eat Ruby. What does he look like? I think it was clear that I got in 2 late last time. The retired general in the former NATO commander told the A&P. And in the view, I preferred lab laws to A&P myself. And Wegmans. Clark announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination of September 2003. Just four months before the first votes were cast. He didn't have a Chinaman's chance in a purgatory. He dropped out of the race the following February with the only victory in 14 caucuses and primaries coming in Oklahoma. And who doubt cares about a Democrat in Oklahoma, right? Right. Clark is considering running again, but he said the late star was one of the mistakes he learned from his last attempt. There was an inability to create a staff at a timely fashion car said. I didn't have a campaign manager until the end of November. I had no money. I had no strategy when I started and I was gagging on a Rubin sandwich. Pussy didn't even order the kishki for quite an hour. How can a panter the old Jewish vote in South Florida when he don't even need the kishki? Do we still have a who stole the kishki by who doubted it? I don't know. I don't know. The polka guy. I look. Who stole the kishki? See you didn't think there was such a thing and then the chicken I found it. I'm not in there. Oh, I got it. It was my only faith based initiative. He said it was one of several mistakes that if I were to run. I hope I wouldn't repeat whatever that means. His only faith based initiative. What does that mean? I don't know what that means. Clark said one factor that changes the number of candidates who have announced their intentions or formed a score to a campaign. The president's Frankie Ankev took off that. Is this Frankie Ankev? He's Yankev and it's a who stole the kishki? I've got a record to believe. Maybe not. Who curious? Wait, I can't get to the local? See, you stopped the kishki? No, stop. Stop because I thought that was enough. No, I want to hear a little of the vocal man. Well, what would I want to say? That's the squeeze meal of the quote. He's going down to play on a harmonic class. 1309 on the pull. Let's just find. Let me see if the phone is pretty modest. I'll get to it. See, you've got to find that balance, baby. It's like trying to balance a elephant on your knee. You know, is it not easy balance? It's a very difficult balance. Isn't it? Oh, yeah. No, it's not. W to cue away. Hello. Hey, Neil, how are you? Good sir. I'm glad I'm sitting on a fondly guy around the writing about rich, y'all retiring. Isn't that pathetic? He announces it Tuesday morning. The hardest splashed at all of their websites. They haven't been a paper yesterday. And the Sun sent all just discovered at this morning. What a bunch of losers. I hope tomorrow. And they write about the Titanic sinking or Neil Armstrong landing on the moon. They've Lincoln had a bad headache too, don't forget. Hey, I don't know if anyone told you. I apologize that they did. Game show network on Sunday night. They had the match game. The real story behind the blank is what it was called. Really? Yeah, it was really good. I had no idea that it was on in 1962. And I had no idea that everyone hit it, Richard Dawson. Like boys. Yes, they did. They did. They did. They did. Huh? They couldn't stand the guy. Because he was an e-existible bastard. And he thought he hated the fact I'm going to show you. And at the end, the winner would pick one of the panelists to match. Remember? And he thought that he automatically should be here every time. Because he was such a genius and such a superstar. And it shouldn't be Brett or Charles Randall's other losers. And that's why they blew him off the show. That's why they installed that wheel. This band, so they had a chance to get the other people. And on the first night, on the show that they did that, it landed on Richard. So they thought that was kind of funny. But yeah, they hated him like boys. And of course, don't forget when they hit family feud and they brought him back after Ray Coleman blew his brains up. And he brought what you got about. He was like 400 pounds and suddenly he was drunk. Are there sure I said? He sounded like we said that in the middle of the whole time. But like Dom Deloitte. Yeah. Later on. See, all of Bert Reynolds wasn't having dinner with him. What do you think about Bert Reynolds and Dom Deloitte? You think there's like a little something there. Maybe they're just close like Oprah or friend Gael. Get the funny tune. Yeah. Oprah and Steadman of course, Steadman's got a beard. Sarah Soda. Almost since the time when you got to hear this, this is about Florida can't take the whole election and get it right. Almost since the time the votes were tallyed on election night and served so that the race for Florida's 13th congressional district has been surrounded by a contentious mystery it says. Why would there no votes for Congress recorded for more than 18,000 people who chose candidates and other races they ask? The answer is sent to a lot more to the outcome of the election, which for now has been won by Republican Burnview Cannon by a mere 3659 votes and his in litigation. Also the continuing debates of what the electronic voting system is in use nationwide can yield reliable tallyed and weakens, and of course the answer is, you know, of course not. So far there are three theories and lots of political and legal posturing. Maybe as scores of voters have said there were glitches with the touch screen systems and they drop votes, or maybe voters overlooked the congressional race simply because of a confusing ballot design, or maybe as some say, and a stoundingly high number of Sarah Soda County residents decided to forego voting in the high profile race, which is for the state of the function of Russian Catholic and Harris here about a claim. And who presided over Florida's Lussian apparatus during the much disputed 2000 contest between Bush and Gore. Tuesday has said Lussian officials in sorry soda ran a mock-a-lussian test in machines for defects that were no clear answers. By evening as political workers input votes, no major problems were reported with the machines must have if you will continue to the week. Our analysis of the results shows that something went very wrong said Kendall coffee who never met a camera, a reporter or any media outlet that he was in his head. And attorney for Buchanan's Challenger Christian Jennings. He played out of significance of the test saying they didn't replicate the voting because the state clerical workers were presumably more adept to the machinery than voters in general would be. They were better with the machine, man. They know how to operate a good machine. Hayden Thempstein attorney for Buchanan said, there's nothing wrong with the machines as these tests show. I've had to record a voter from Buchanan and thought it was pad. Hey, Rick, you redneck. George Hatesew. The essence of these updated spout arises from the fact that once all the votes were counted in November 7th election, a troubling anomaly appeared in the tally. More than 18,000 people who had voted another contest didn't have selections recorded in congressional race. The phenomenon of voters casting ballots without making selections in every race is known as under voting and happens in virtually every big election, especially in contests for less than an orifice of the Semboaters ignore. But here's the big but. Okay. Did he die or something or what? No, wait. Oh. But the magnitude of the under voting in the Buchanan Jennings race was startling about 15% of those who can't spell some service order. Now, contrast was about 2.5% among voters in other counties. 15% count them in sorry soda where I used to work at WSPV out there on city island. What a beautiful place. We're like a lot of you think the people in, in market are old or the people in. Boca. They're grandparents live in sorry soda. Good. God. What an ancient place. Jennings invites five of the loss of legend that thousands of service order county votes were not counted because of the pervasive malfunctioning of electronic voting machines. The county kills in her favor. The broken machine through is backed by two voting experts and scores of swarmsfamets from voters who had trouble with the machines coffee said they were bad machines mine. Like several of the ones that would buy. The soda soda hell tribuners reported that more than 100 reported problems with the machines. But other experts who analyzed the ballots and results are given that the culprit might not be the machines. But rather voters confused by a poorly designed ballot. The congressional race appeared on the same screen as the Gubernatorial Contest, which had a brighter paner and took up more space. And like big bright lights like hey here you go. Here's Charlie Chris. 10 soccer. They Massachusetts Institute technology. MIT directed the Caltech MIT voting technology project. Said test in his library showed that as many as 60% of voters can resist when they're displayed in such a man. So, but I think they have a repo which is what they're calling for. Right. Let's do it again. Do it again like the beach boys would say. Do it again. I know you got that. We keep playing that over. And what's that? Cool. Oh, I love that.
