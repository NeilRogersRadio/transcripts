Hey, it's almost out of here and time to bring Neil in from north of the border tomorrow. Yeah. What's up? How you doing? It's Wednesday. It's woodbind day. Ah. I hear that echo in the back. What the was that? I don't know. Anyway, my chat with Julius today for about a half an hour. What a great guy. Man, like I did, I tell you we've been released from Death Row. Great, sure today. Well, good for him. Anyway, I talk with you a little bit yesterday too. Yep. It's going to be a guy. Yep. Radio guy. Radio guy. Sales oriented. Right. Not interested in any charity cases in the building. No. Oh. Yeah. In other words, more like business than we ever have been. You know, we've been too much monkey business last day years. I think we're like real business. Like a radio business. Business. Things like that. Got a couple of good articles on Sam Alito here. Yeah. Boy, yeah. I'll get to him. That's not a good thing. You know, that Lindsey Graham, a little a Yahoo redneck from a South Carolina. That's on the committee. Did you do hear a committee? He was one of the people coaching Alito in the White House, which is totally illegal, by the way. Yeah. And he's got a hold on. His nomination is illegal. Yeah. It is a whole bunch of hanky panky behind there. But the bottom line is, you know, people want to waste their time watching their exercise. Go ahead. But it's the fixes already in. And then I'm a cratser, you know, but it would be pretty good. And a lot of Maran's going to tough questions like always. And then when push comes to show. And I get this 20 or 22 votes against and he'll give confirmed. And there goes, you know, Roe V Wade. And there goes a lot of your freedoms right down the toilet. You know, I'll push that there. Ripping a Democrats for ripping the people or critical of the war. Still, and to see the whole thing. You know, you could pick up last year's newspapers. You see this thing that you're reading this year. That's correct. And that's because the media goes along with it. Most of the 90 percent of the mainstream media just a bunch of shields. They're all in his pocket anyway. So what's the use? And now that they're going to like to conserve it of government in Canada. It's just, these people also want a little taste. A little taste of fascism, I guess, is that what everybody likes. You know, just dabble in it for a while. Assuming that you're going to be able to get out of it. So you're going to want to find a staff in there? Yes sir, to a clock straight up and down. I'll be out that door, man. You called me on my way. Huh? Gulf stream is running today. Well, there you go. Go over to Carter and punch your guts out. I think I'll pass today. Why is that? Always the racing you've called students so far. The stakes have been good. Yeah. I'm talking about the food. I'm talking about the, oh yeah. The stake races are good. Yeah. The rest of it has been, was been in the past very ordinary. Mm-hmm. Lots of cheat climbers made and raised. That's what it is. When did you, I think you and Gulf stream had a falling out about the same time. I guess they had something. They just had to not stage great racing over the land. Or not like they used to. Or great concerts either, you know. Well, they're out of the concert. But when are we going to bring back Johnny Meister on the Brooklyn Bridge one last time? No, there's no concerts today. I know of this year. Yeah. Well, they probably don't have anywhere to hold them now. Well, they get plenty of space. Do they? Yeah. I think I actually was a little bit one day. I want to see, well, what, what's they get to slots? Of course, most of my slotting will be a pomp and a park. But I think one of the slots in 4M will be spectacular. Well, there you go. It will. Although you said it'll be spectacular, but I mean, they're limited to, isn't it? 1500? Yeah. But I mean, the facility is going to be beautiful. Right. And by the way, 50 families, nobody think that's a really small number. I mean, it's not what they would have liked, but 1500 machines, my ex says, because with mine's got 1700, it's pretty big. It's heavy duty. Yeah. I mean, at no point you ever go in there and see, although I will say this two weeks ago today, the Wednesday between like right after Christmas and boxing they hear, that whole week between Christmas and New Year's. And a little, if I would have realized there would never go in there. Man, you could really get a machine of any kinder. That place was just jam packed at week, because most people, you know, take that whole week off. And so that place was just hoppin'. How do you like to have an A? If tax free accounts somewhere in Jerusalem, the revenue that they took in on that one day. Wow. Unbelievable. Just cranking it out. I would like to have a tax free account. Anyhow. Like Ted Erson. Oh, let's not get back on adding up. Don't want to do that. That's enough for that. I still say, man, I talk about all this corruption going on for crying out loud. Can you imagine the amount of money that's been smeared in the legislature and elsewhere to keep gambling out of Florida? And I'm not just talking about this lot. I'm talking about over the years. You know, I've had to have just been on the ballot. The money that's been spent unsuccessfully to bring gambling in. Yeah. I bet you're some more. Mmm. Maybe upfront. Lots of money. Lots more upfront. But not behind the scene. Lots of money has been swine. And that means man, it's getting smeared really good. What's that guy that's still fighting the one guy that we found. I was a total phony up in Orlando fighting against the slots that he wants to put it on a ballot again. They're disguised on a payroll with the Indians. I can tell you that there are people in business in Nevada who have been spending a lot of money in this day trying to get gambling here. Mmm. Ain't gonna happen. Well, let me ask you this question. You're saying ain't gonna happen once the Indians get clans 3 and I can't see anywhere they can keep that out. What's to prevent somebody else from doing it? Because they won't pass a law for it. They based on what? They can put in slots with I'm talking about, you know, four casinos with blackjack and and roulette. Mmm. Nice. Nice. I think it's about some time somebody made the Fed as governor or an offering camera fuse, you know. Cut the crap already. Can you imagine? I don't care what anybody says, you know what? I don't want to. I think that's a good idea. And you know what? I've got to suggest. Yeah. We take them out to, you know, like the ranch. Yeah. Put something in this drink. Let them wake up in a bloody bed. Oh, that's bad. That's bad. And it's on my time now too. That's really bad. Well, it seems to work. I mean, with a hooker like that Senator from Nevada. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Our offstanding righteous governor with his very functional family there. Let me tell you the Corly Own, the family. Yeah. My offer to you is this, Senator. Nothing. He even talks like, Jim. Who's that? The Corly Own, the family. Go back to the days of rash of you. Yeah. Yeah. He was a good old boy. Yeah. Oh, well, until he got in bed with that hooker. Well, I love it. He was who she was like an illegal alien stuff like that. Maybe we should get the governor's son when it's like always having Hanky, Panky problems, you know, booze and rods and all that stuff. Yeah, that family is a little dysfunctional. It's good that we got a good religious righteous family up there with her. Christian, you know, jails and Christian education and Christian, Christian, Christian, corruption, it's great. Yeah. Wife is smuggling. Yeah. That's right. Everybody in the family is dysfunctional. Hey, Ray. Yeah. Don't lose too much of color today. You know, I don't think I'm going to come on. Come on. You've got to feed the abrid man. You're a horse owner and lover. You've got to go out there and feed the breed. They got to need. Ha ha ha ha. You're convincing. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, Mr. We lost company. I'm going to go out there and probably lose my answer. It's such a good day on Saturday and I'm not going to happen again. Yeah. I had a good day Sunday. I'd like to keep it for a few days. And then on Monday, I got off for Martin Luther King Day on Monday. I'm taking that day off. Are you working Monday or not? No, I'm going to take off, uh, well, that president is saying. That's good. We don't want, we want to like balance it out. We don't want to be like, uh, during all those holidays. Yeah. It was suggested to me that it would be a good idea if I did that since I got it. Really? We're taking off. They're actually taking a look at things like that here. Yeah. What's not amazing. Once the last time that somebody came to you and said, we have these two days, uh, company, uh, deal here. You can take either one off, which one do you want? I mean, what one did that ever happen before? I mean, what is it? I just a matter of like two weeks or a week and a half, something like that. We got a new GM and all of a sudden the whole agenda has changed. The whole approach like a real, uh, like, like people count. You know, well, it does seem to be some attention to detail. Yeah. Attention to people, as opposed to just the people in a certain way. I'm going to say something. You should see the way that sales department, yeah, is a buzz. Oh, I would imagine. I mean, yeah, the last couple years you walk over there and you could drop a bomb and you might wake a couple people up. Yeah. Now, line to the Godfather house, Paul. Oh, Paul. We won't see him. Yeah. Well, that's the same with the several of those people in sales right now. They are hustling. Don't see them normal. They'll be out the door. I noticed last two days the log is just jam packed with real spots. What's that all about? Not only that. Like, I do my NCAA basketball preview show with all those coaches every year. Yeah. The sales manager actually asked me for background information on it. He spoke to you. Yeah. Well, they used to just sell one thing at a time. Yeah. They weren't able to sell more than one thing at a time. But now there's Raymond Burr actually spoke to you. Two months in advance of the show. This respectful thing you've said about him on the year. Two months in advance of the show they're going to try to sell it. Wow. That's revolutionary. What are your right? They're scoring a roundman like a bunch of busy beavers back there because they know that Their their days may be numbered in single digits if they don't cut the cramp. So let's bring those spots in. Some so glad to hear the Greg is in a building. Maybe you can witness what a real radio operation is like. Oh, head for colder now. Are you really? I gotta do something to get out of here. There you go. Head over to colder. Head yourself to the good food. Say hi to my friend Mickey. I will. I have a nice shot. Mickey asked for you all the time. Well, tell her I send my best. But I think she's a ghosting. Well, whatever. She's in the same spot for a message in the comments. The words to learn to handle them. Okay. Have a good day. Good luck. Tons your guts out. You too. Don't be afraid. Step right up. Okay. See you. For more sign those live. So next week on ABC. It's the Duke's dog's home. Write a log with those two zitty helicopters. Join me in time. Is there hot-up for TV Marty? The genital V. Throw down your basket. Motely going diving. How's it going? Hot-ratt. I can't stand and see how the gunman is. Watch the boots out with boss bomb. Head of condos security. Hey, you get hit with my japhols and got to Zorin. I'm taxable. I still hope I'm dead. Yeah, come on. Let's go to school. Let's bring Jay to you. Yeah. He lets me use a board of high. Take a lesson here to get a good long life. Or I don't want to see him. I don't like him. I got to think a card and you're some kind of hot-ratt guy. The Duke's involved in all Thursdays at 9. On NBC. 11 after 10, good morning. It's Wednesday, January 11. Happy Wednesday, too. Things are really looking up. And that's amazing how we all have this kind of like a lint in our step. Or something like that. A little spring in our thing. Nothing like that. Anyway, it's already time for that first break. Why don't we do this? Get all backed up. Hope Hank wins at least 2-3,000 out of quarter this afternoon. I'm going to try to do the same. We'll spread it around. And don't forget you got that movie coming a day now. I didn't forget. If I keep having good days of woodmine, I can keep going on Amazon.com And it's almost like for free when you can't write down. It's a bar good. What's that movie? Primals fear. Jeb Richard gear. Rimes with. Rimes with the steer. No, I wouldn't steer you wrong. And I wouldn't. And speaking that, I think you'll agree with me after you watch it. That he was just fine. And then he did a good job. He can't act with this. And I know seriously after the first human, it's you forget that it's him. That's the only saving aggression that he. Huh? That's extra good. No, that that's why it's a good movie. Because if you keep thinking about it, it's Richard gear and I can't stand that creep. Uh, then you can't enjoy the movie. You're like it. But be sure and watch it all the way through to the very end. Because you think, you know, there's a point comes that you think is the end. And it's not. From a set to ten, it's five sixty wq a m. It's that. The you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're all prepared. That's not how to. To count. To count. To count. To count. To count. There's not more strength. To count.

He wrote for their Pat Valentine's to free me cowboy crimes. On Saturday, come downtown, where somehow we're on past no line. You're fair. Ten eighteen to five sixty, nobody can hear the pool. I got myself all back in this because we're so far ahead on the pools now. I give the result of the day before we got the new one on there. We already did the one that's been paid for. Oh man, I thought this was the one for tomorrow. Oh no, the one for tomorrow is going to be under about eleven eleven thirty. You're going to like the one for tomorrow. Have you looked at it yet? No. You can click on where it says history there. No, don't change it heavy. No, I don't even want to risk it. Oh wait, you're like it. I like this one. I thought this was good. We had a lot of fun with the two for like about the first twenty minutes. It was alright. What do you miss most about your childhood? We got about sixteen hundred votes. Having no worries, three hundred and seventy six. And of course, most of these are for people that had good childhoods. Or at least decent ones or something good to remember. The other one will be doing on Friday. People had a crappy childhoods and hated like poison. Having no worries, three seventy six, summer vacation, one sixty one. No bills to pay, one forty six.

Like night flight used to show a bunch of things like that. I really missed that show. They would go into like vintage, campy stuff like that. Yeah, it was great. But it really is most amusing.

Saturday morning cartoons, seventy five. They were great. Sex without a condom, seventy two. My parents being healthy, sixty eight. Nothing. It sucks, sixty two. See I told you.

Little to their parents know that they were just that. That's probably why a lot of kids, lotting people were nasty and they were just doing all kinds of crappy stuff when you were just hoping you get spanked. You really are all of these things. Loved it. Return soda bottles for money eighteen. No deposit, no return. This is still say that in some stuff I guess it does. Yeah, but you know, that's the opposite. It was no bottles much anymore except for beer. What about coke? You still buy coke and bottle. Yeah, this is still hard. But it says it's what Noel Boe said. It's a it's a rarer anymore. Pinball machine seventeen. Common book sixteen, believing in Sandy Clause fourteen. Oh, that was so much fun, I guess. Halloween trick and treat and thirteen spring break twelve. See the Sandy Closting your parents lied to you about that because they were taught by their parents to lie about it. Just like the god stuff and the two theory stuff and all of these things.

Now how much does it bring again for allowance? Twenty bucks a week. Twenty bucks a week and coming from a desk barato like you. That's right. Big books. That is big books. I got two articles on a leader when this whole dog and pony show that's going on. I'm just the spirit of Christ can tell me to read these before we do anything else. Although we will take the one call or because I know it's going to be real brief. 2 a.m. Hello. Neil. Speaking of Ed Norton movie, you ever seen Cyclope? I wouldn't watch that. I saw like about two minutes so it would look ten times. It's such a great so man. It looked the list of purpose. I mean Brad Pitt and Fight Club. Well, it's got the same payoff like that move you're talking about with gear. That's right. Yeah. Huh. George keeps saying no in the background. I tried watching it and I saw like it's been on cable as it in times and I watch about two three minutes and I say what's the point in this you know I'm not for me. Well that's a great segue to my next question. Yeah. I have a great idea for a poll. Oh, we agree. What is it? Sweeper movies. Movies that you know you can just think about seeing you. I'm talking in the chat. Yeah. That's where they went away. You know like the movie crash. I just saw recently. I really wanted to see that so I got to go. Well anybody said it was good. Yeah. I had no interest in seeing that movie. All the sudden I watched it because I was born one day and it blew me away. It was amazing. Great. We didn't put that really. I think it all 10 ones like that. But let's do it again. Sling for movies. There you go. And I'll put crash right at the end of the list. Keep up the good work. Oh, we'll do it. All right. Now that we got like a real management. My one. What do we do? We do it. It's about fight club which I I really wanted to like that movie. Yeah. And I was liking it at two point. It's all hallucination. Well you just spoiled it. Yeah. For everybody. For everybody. Don't. Well I'm going to take you to the primal fear now. So they're not going to. I can't do that. I wouldn't do that to you. Thank you. I hate that that pisses you off. It's like one's a pun of time in America. Although in that one, at least you're left to speculate whether it was like a an opium trip. Here's the rubber senior was having a whether we all had stuff really happened. Since movies are fiction anyway, why say that it was all the dream or a hallucination. No, no, whatever was. Yeah. Hey noodles. And there's games. Would you want to pop. Pop. And took us. You know, see if he was really. Why did he say that so badly? A potion took us. Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's just a bad actor. What do I mean? A legal and his coaches. This is in the village voice. For Supreme Court nominee, the hearings are an inside game. In the first hours of San Toledo Senate confirmation hearings on Monday, due to here, we're committing member Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina. May very well have a reparably compromised himself. Maybe this is why, if I can enter Jack Russ Fyngold, kept asking to leave a yesterday about what didn't he get coached by anybody in the White House, did they tell him what to say? That's must be what he was referring to. That's the hearing. Graham told the lead, don't nominee for the Supreme Court that he had already decided in the lead of Stavor. I don't know what kind of what you're going to get, but you'll make it through. It's possible he could talk me out of voting for you, but I doubt it. So I won't even try to challenge you along those lines. That's certainly ought to be the case. Graham is one of a group of Republicans who've been coaching the lead. He'll be behind the scenes. The Wall Street Journal's Washington Wire reported before the hearings began. Last Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the gang of 14 of the sons of judiciary, joined a so-called move court session at the White House. The coaching session for the lead was raised a few eyebrows. Coaching a judicial nominee behind the scenes is not the proper role for a judiciary committee member who most subsequently, most subsequently sitting judgment on that nominee right, Sting Progress, a project of the American Progress Action Fund. It could be a violation of the ethical duties of a senator. Writing about the lead of situation, Sting Progress writes Senate rule 37 of the Senate Ethics Manual. The rule says, no member officer or employee shall engage in any outside business or professional activity or employment for compensation, which is inconsistent or in conflict with the conscientious performance of official duties. Sting Progress further starts the ethics manual saying that language has been interpreted as prohibiting compensated employment or uncomplicated positions on boards, commissions or advisory councils, where such service could create a conflict with individual senators, due to appropriation oversight authorization or legislative jurisdiction as a result of Senate duties. If this is true, how can Graham make an impartial decision about a lead or based on what he learns about a lead or what they're hearing? Scrams already made up his mind. He was coaching him and he's sitting there like that and impartial law is going to judge for America. How do you like that? Nothing most of them have made up their minds, but this is right. Way above and beyond a call of duty, if I can say that, can I say duty? No, we can now. So, greats in a building. Great. You're gonna just like remember what Michael gave Fredo that kiss on the lips. Oh, and we got five, you remember the kiss of death? That was the one. I don't see what's on under. What is that under? GF. No, I know that. She's got all my jeep. Don't ever take signs with anyone against the family. No, that was... I know. There you go. You broke my heart. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you'd run this game so, exactly. Oh, it's half of the break, dammit. And then the other one about the Alito Testimotive you won't hear by Stephen Ardue Jack, who was supposed to testify, and he got blown out, and I'll tell you why in a second. About that, well, I'm going to get to it. CAP. That Princeton organization?

And any kids in a clock tonight. Anyway, Stephen R. Dojack graduated from Princeton and covered cap for the University's alumni magazine from 76 to 86. He writes, in 21st century Washington fame doesn't last for 15 minutes anymore. Last for a single news cycle. There's a big press release. Next morning, the major news paper spread your name right. But by noon, the drug report runs a shotgun blast of half truths in any windows. And by evening, pundits are sifting through your entrails on CNN and Fox. Can citizen participation and governments survive the advent of the internet search engine? Late last Thursday, Patrick Lehi, the ranking Democrat on Senate Judiciary Committee. Issue to list of witnesses to testify with the Democrats on San Melitos nomination of the Supreme Court. I was on that list. A mirror writer with a bachelor's degree among all the distinguished household names. But by the end of the day Friday, I was nonetheless any more. I had been scheduled to testify as an expert on an organization called Concerned Alumni of Princeton. In 1985, on an application for a promotion in the Reagan Justice Department, a member of the United States, who had touted his membership in Cat, which had a post-coviducation in Princeton, and asked for strict code as limiting the numbers of women and minorities at the university. Alito's membership in the group could shed light on his respect for civil rights. So how to put what happened to me? I felt like Joey on friends when he finally went to roll on the soap opera. He could walk proudly, head held high among his more accomplished peers. But then his soap opera character fell down on an elevator shaft, written out of the show because the scriptwriter was anointed something Joey said in another context. In my case it was an LA Times-op-ed article I wrote. In animal's separate perpetual holocaust, 2003, I defended PETA, people for the ethical treatment of animals for using your quote of my grandfather's. Unlike me, my grandfather was a famous man, Isaac for service singer, who would escape the anti-Semitism in Europe in 1935, and woman of Elp Prisvaled, returned 78. My grandfather, a principal vegetarian, famously wrote, in relation to animals, all people are Nazis for them as an eternal troublemaker. Three years ago, PETA built a campaign around that quote, but critic charged that the words were not really Isaac's only those of one of his characters. My opheil article affirmed that from my personal knowledge Isaac felt that way, that the cattle car reality effect reforming compared to the holocaust died with him. In the air of the search engine, no good or bad deed goes unpunished. Then again, perhaps I should take pride in being ridiculed by a US Senator John Corn and Republican at Texas. It seems like a little bit of desperation to call a witness his only a pernex expertise is comparing meat-eaters to those who stood by doing the holocaust according to spokesman said. The Washington Times led with a freelance reporter who compared the holocaust to eating meat, a right-wing blog bloated, latest democratic charge, Alito Zacarnahor. I haven't found an account from the right that I mentioned Isaac or his quote. As it turned out, hundreds of decent arable holocaust victims in the families were deeply disturbed by the original as saying I have apologized public for it, and Apology are re-edirrated right here. Sometimes using an extreme example to make a point is a bad idea, sometimes a quote really doesn't belong in a new context, too bad my latest attackers don't give it. Bill Bradley, Princeton, Texas 65, Future Democratic Senator, quit cap and discussed within a year after was founded in 72, Bill Frist, Texas 74, Future Republican Senate Majority Leader, publicly censored the organization, but capsified to become more anti-woman anti-minoid. In 1984, year before Alito probably proclaimed his membership, caps magazine had published details of an underage female student sex life and named her allegedly by mistake. A few issues before that in a piece about blacks and Latinos, the magazine editorialized, people nowadays just don't seem to know their place. In response to questions about capitalito has proclaimed his field-teach American principles of equality, but when he had a chance to make a real statement, back when cap was spreading its poison, he boasted a being a member. That's the story that should have gotten its 15 minutes this week, but you won't hear about it for me. How do you like that? So here's a guy that was supposed to testify, but you won't hear about it from him. God forbid. So we know what this is, but of all his protestations and but it would be this whiny piece of right wing turrets sitting there right now. We know what he is, he's just not a good-to-car carrying Nazi, a Reagan Nazi abortion Nazi, that's all he is. So all the naive folks out there would think, oh he's okay. He's like they take a pull before the hearing's even started, they take a pull on CNN and Gallup. Oh well 52% of Americans think that he should be confirmed based on what? They would know, San Alito, if he came knocking on a door at three in the morning in a bathroom, they know who the hell he is, or what he stands for, but he believes in it boosts chosen than he's a good idea. Yeah, of course they also asked if he wants to undo a roe-be-way, he should have been confirmed. He confirmed 56% said no, but of course that was kind of like the secondary pull we saw at the end of that piece. Brother.

We called them black world programs and operations But now Tice tells ABC news that some of those secret black world operations run by the NSA were operated ways that he believes violated the law He's prepared in telcon was all he knows about the ledge wrong doing these programs run by the defense department of National Security Agency me postbound 11 efforts to go after terrorists at least allegedly the mentality was we need to get these guys We're gonna do whatever takes to get him. He said Tice says the technology exists to track and sort to every domestic international phone call as They were switched to such the center such as one in New York and the search to search for keywords or phrases that a terrorist might use Like when a bomba Grande, oh, did I say that? Oh If you picked the word G had out of a conversation Tice said they technology exists that you focus in on that conversation and you pull out of the system for processing Like cheese like processed cheese Don't you look when it says on the label processed cheese product food? Which means there ain't no real change right? Like some cheese food right? We're gonna touch it chemicals that looks incantated orange and can taste a little like cheese By cheese right According to Tice intelligence analyst using information developed graph that resembles spiderwebs linking one suspect's phone number to hundreds or thousands even more President owner he goes crack in his knuckles again. I just heard that yeah knuckles are Rodriguez a Ha ha ha ha ha ha no President forces admitted that he gave orders that allow the NSA to eavesdrop on a small number of Americans well to usual Representative war it's a small number maybe you know 20 30 million But Tice decision raises he says the number of Americans subject to eavesdropping by the NSA could be in the millions If the full range of secret NSA programs is used in the millions That would mean for most Americans that if they conducted or you know placed no overseas communication more than likely They were sucked into that vacuum tice said So like when I was an answer them I made a phone call and they might have been eavesdropping that's why didn't make too many phone calls from Amsterdam That's why I was cooking bad that black there even no George is a mom when he's got to be a fair traffic Yeah, it asked kick the same day the New York Times broke the story of the NSA eavesdropping without orange Tice surface as a whistleblower in the agency totally received news that he was a source of the times reporters But Tice maintains that his conscience is clear as far as I'm concerned as long as I don't see anything That's classified. I'm not worried he said me. Yeah, don't worry be happy We need to clean up the intelligence committee. We've had abuses. They need to be addressed the NSA We've worked tire security clearance in May of last year based on what it called Psychological concerns and later dismissed him Tice calls that bunk and says that's the way the NSA deals with troublemakers and whistleblowers Today the NSA said it had no information to provide Their mom they understand a word. I don't like that the same thing with Richard Clark and with the Apollo Neil Everybody else all while you know on your use classified information in that book we might have to throw his ass in jail and all of a sudden We'd ever heard one more word from me and I was saying Every right exactly all of a sudden he was mom and Little more on the NSA See you know, this is the problem is that most of us are so naive you know We believe no people are conditionally and all with the church tells you is true What your parents said you is true with the government a government would never lie to you Because after all we're here to protect you and to take care of you right and The rape you and give all your money to a big group of corporations.

Right Nile national security agency has been spying on a Baltimore anti-war group according to documents released during litigation Going so far to document the inflating of protesters balloons and intended to deploy units trained to detect weapons of mass destruction raw story has learned According to the documents the tent of resistance Baltimore a quaker-linked peace group And we know about how dangerous those quakers are especially when the feeling their oaths Has been monitored by the NSA working with the Baltimore intelligence unit the Baltimore city police department every quickers oaths Oh, yeah sure really you know we've all been Like a mouchy, you know sure is real mouchy. I don't have a lot of really like rule I think it's cruel the feed kids grew. Don't you know what is it butter and brown sugar? What's your credit that a quaker oaths?

Why is that supposed to be so much better? It's still those same poison? It just has a flavor rather than a tater loss of meat right? The documents came as a result of litigation in the August 2003 trial of Maryland Carlisle and Cindy far-quar Farcure-harr. Well, I'll not gonna try it again careful and NSA security official provided the defendants with a we-debted action plan may be dented copy of a joint terrorism task force email about the activities of the types of resistance activities The NSA established in 52 by President Truman is the largest and most secret of US intelligence agencies Headquartered between Baltimore and Washington DC the agencies got two principal functions to protect US government communications and to intercept foreign transmissions However the NSA's United States signals intelligence directive 18 strictly prohibits the intercept your collective information about US persons entities Corporations or organizations without explicit written permission from the attorney general The revelation that a Baltimore peace group was spied upon comes in the wake of news reports the agency's also been Eavesdropping on US the agency did not return to call a request or comment The Baltimore pledge of resistance is part of the National Iraq Tiger resistance which worked with the Baltimore emergency We spots network in American friend service committee part of an National group committed to nine violence Resistance to stop the war in Iraq The pledge lobbies Maryland Congress members via letters phone calls facts as emails and face-to-face meetings Members of the group are periodically arrested for peaceful protests Documents turned over by the NSA in the case that the group was closely monitored in one instance the agency File reports approximately every 15 minutes from 9.30 a.m. to 3.18 p.m. on the David demonstration at the National vigilance airplane memorial on the NSA campus in Maryland According to an NSA email David July 4, 2004 how patriotic the agency collected license numbers and descriptions at the number of people in each car and Found a report about them gathering in a church parking lot for the demonstration NSA agents also logged their travel to demonstration including stopping as again at a gas station along the way a K9 dog unit was used to search a mini van when it was stopped on the way to the demonstration of course nothing was found Maybe a little dog food Maybe some doggy treats. Hope it was that dilidated. Oh Geez NSA officials even reported on the balloons being inflated for the demonstration the content of their signs Study like that. They're blowing up balloons. Gotta know as they might explode in them and these might be weapons of ask destruction Give her sticker balloon and you're asked Just this morning. Well think about it An entry made a 1300 hours on July 4 reads the society was advised the sock what is that? Society the something was advised the protesters were perceived at the airplane Memorial with three hell a healing and balloons attached to a banner that stated Those who are seeing feeding for security deserve neither will ultimately lose both On the van administration three protesters were cited for disturbances on government poll property and release They federal is eventually dismissed the case before trial Two of those demonstrators max obazusky and Ellen Barfield are still scheduled for trial and Baltimore Federal court January 25 the defendants have filed a motion for discovery included the letter from the NSA acknowledging spying on the pledge The prosecutor's refuse releases information as part of discovery The defendants plan to argue that information is necessary for the defense The NSA confirmed because of a free information and a request I filed that indeed has files on peace and justice groups Abazusky said however the agencies refusing to release the information unless I pay 1915 bus what just might be in those files? I'd like that If extensive plans are described for the last day of October For 2004 demonstration bloodshed the NSA planned to have their weapons and mass destruction rapid response team on site an officer with the shotgun and increase a number of officers Mobile units moderately in parking lot robbing patrols on bicycles in various areas for keen on handlers Agency provide counter surveillance area lodged evacions by the air and our endell Maryland police and photography video surveillance unit the activities Shocking a polling and unnecessary is how the chair of the DC chapter of the National Lawyers The demonstration support can be marked goldstone describes the NSA actions Goldstone who often represents activists who engage in nonviolent civil disobedience is not counselless litigation This surveillance is completely unrelated to an even an expansive devination of national security How do you like that? And it goes on and on and on the vetoes on baby This is just exactly how the Gestapo work and how they're working right now They're open up your mail they're listening to your phone calls Monitor in your balloon blowing and probably other times is right name the rights master go in there exactly So congratulations all your virtual overjucking You know monitor a a county pink over Christ Open a county pink was male for Jesus Well guess what was on speaking of that last night the liver guess what will be on speaking of Jesus the passion of the oh Yeah Christ Ask me how many seconds that I watch How many seconds that you watch two That was a little bit of the channel.

Or the new Sam who is great respect for precedent and an open mind about abortion cases Is he the old Sam who plotted ways to tip the balance of part of the executive branch or the new Sam who states that no person in this country is above the law And then it clues the president is the old Sam who said Robert Thorck was one of the most outstanding nominees of the century and a man of unequal ability or the new Sam who shrugged off that statement as the Dutiful support of one Reagan appointee for another is he the old Sam a who said a membership in a Princeton alumni club that Resisted the admission of women minorities when he was seeking a promotion of a very white Reagan old boys club or the new Sam who has no specific Recollection of that organization unless of course he instantly joined into support ROTC on campus And the say he's been shaped partly by his hopes for a 17-year-old daughter Laura and by his sister's experiences is a trial or a Prefection that has been traditionally dominated by men Is he the old Sam who thoughtlessly blew off a pledge to recuse himself from cases involving Vanguard where he has a six-figure mutual fund or the New Sam who admits that the problem was not a computer glitch S.E.S. suggested and humbly says if I had to do it over again, there were things I would have done differently The judge didn't aim to say what he thought of illegal wiretaps, which you think would be an easy one About the judge's memory lapses Senator Lindsey Graham a Republican droolly noted and I hope you'll understand if any of us come up before a court And we can't remember Abram off he'll tend to believe us Some of his answers Senator Joe Biden complained to Chris Matthews did not ring a court of sincerity the National Review website says the Vagible Biden got in 367ty words in held judge leader do only a thousand thirteen You don't have to know the difference between horizontal and vertical stared as a starry decisive Or between emanations and for numbers to see that the man who could take Saturday or Connor seat and yank back Women's rights was in a word shifty or in three words shifty sapless and sying Not sying as much as we'll put squeegean our video, but nevertheless To also say this reputation and women's rights even played the hand-packed husband when Republican senators use the expression when did you stop beating your wife about them or credit questions judge leader right posted I wasn't asked whether she had stopped beating me It's basic to fence to the McRass boil down to I was just saying what my boss wanted to hear at the time Have we had enough yes men men men men men men men men government for last five years heck of a job Sammy I understand by the presence from the judge mr. Leeto is dubbed Scolito a conservative Senator John Corness and only blurred it off the nickname because he's so much like Antonin Scolita and W. Loves Nino Judge Leeto is supported in period of power for the presidency not strong checks and balances He approved the scripture to the 10 year old girl, but that's not probing too deeply about the executive branch is doing That W is philosophy to a preemptive right to see really do everything for more to torture the snooping Like the president the judge's law is baseball Mr. Leeto once vacation at a fantasy baseball camp wearing the red and white police uniform W has spent five years in fantasy land on Iraq on occasion dawning military costumes His fingers in his ears doubly didn't want to hear that we had two few troops in Iraq ignoring advice from viceroy Paul Bremer and general Eryxon sefi or that's a troops didn't have enough armor But the president continues to fling blame outward and a speech yesterday before the veterans of foreign wars He warned the Democrats that they should take care not to bring comfort to our adversaries Judge Elito was evasive disingenuous and differential he puts the fits the bush here or like a baseball glove I like that even normally can't be proud of that that old jack strap were in queen See here's one that says a Cuban Con bestake con you and bread with steak or steak sandwiches, but they're trying to see We would South like Florida cute since the three genel do we want to put like South Florida Cuban or something like that How about mid Florida Cuban?

Not good. Not good. Maybe they just took off and went in the hiding. Maybe they left the country. We would have to wait to hungry for some goulash. Could be. It is real. We'll not do business with Pat Robertson after religious leaders suggested. Prime Minister Sharone's master's stroke was a divine punishment for the Gaza would draw. A choice in the official state of the honeymoon over. Robertson, when he's busy doing business everywhere, man he has those diamond mines, you know, in Nigeria and Liberia and all of these. He was good buddies with Charles Wilson. We were one of the world's biggest crooks. Robertson is leading a group of Christian evangelicals who have pledged to raise $50 million to wait until you hear this. $50 million to build a large Christian tourism center in Israel's northern Galley region where traditions as Jesus lived in town. Isn't that what this is? Is there a lease for human in the building? Christian tourism center? Well, even those go in spend a lot of money. Yes. He hates the holy land for everyone. But Edo Hartov, a spokesman for tourism minister Abraham Hirshan, said his really officials were furious with Robertson. If you think Hugo Chavez was past you ain't seen nothing yet. In addition to which Hugo Chavez is lacking one thing that the Israelis are God. I'm going to bomb a grande. Well, I think it would be perfectly appropriate for these Israelis to say since he was taken. He was saying, let's take Hugo Chavez. Maybe he's really ought to be starting to suggest, let's take out Pat Robertson. Take him up for a notch? Right. And then kick his ass. One day after Shiron's January 4th, Strowck Robertson said the crime minister was being punished for dividing God's land. A reference to last summer's pull off from the Gaza Strip and Fort West Bank settlements. We can't accept this kind of statement, Hartov said. He said the Christian Heritage Center project was now in question that we let the door open and develop it with others. We will not do business with him. Only with other evangelical people. So don't fact these comments, Hartov said. Will the business with other evangelical leaders friends of Israel, but as far as he goes, cast a horse. Those are the public's important aerial charoans we cover are welcome to business for those he said. A spokesman for Robertson's selfish ministry based in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where they're still lynching people by the way we'll get to that story. That's a real pleasant story. What did I tell you about the USA? There's nothing different now than it was 100 years ago. So they fought the civil war. They put some laws in the prison. They used to go so they fought the civil war. They put some laws in the books. And still the same racist bunch of crap. Yeah. We're no question about it unless you can play basketball or pro football, forget about it. Or unless you real like complicated and turn a take as far turn to the right, like Condor Condor Leesor. We don't respond immediately. We force in our relationship with other governments. We have not talked to these families on this topic. So Robertson's television ministry spokeswoman, we continue to maintain our longstanding commitment to the Jewish people and the state of Israel. As long as they sooner or later they can heard, they come around. Robertson's comments through condemnation from other Christian leaders and even the presidentate, even the Bushmeister. Under way, ten of the agreement, Robertson's group was to put up the funding while Israel would provide land infrastructure for the center. Israeli officials had hoped the project would generate tens of millions of dollars in tourism. And but it would put about the now and the finally starting to catch on. We'll just slow on the update for the finally starting at least to catch on to him. Car stereo we follow what we heard about him yet. He's the one to put the lynch in lynxburg.

He's no longer young Republicans. We've won a first practice to deceive The thumb line it runs down through the cesspool of the festering abrimoth release scandal is the conceit that the science of the regular revolution A generation of young Republican activists summoned by God and party were morally superior creatures who had only pure ideological Lotus for cutting country social safety nets in the name of small government More than two decades before you've seen a killing to fill these in two jurisdictions Jack abrimoth was the hard-nosed chairman of the college Republicans and his latinans were Harvard graduate Grover Norquist who rose to political powers president the American taxpayers association and a young Georgia student named Ralph Reed Who would later become the face of a Christian coalition? Today our party read his itself from out the wave of the future We're all sermonizing a 25 as a 25 year old and through a public and national convention 84 as reported mother Jones magazine We will ride that wave to glory or will it send us crashing offshore if we're the party of tax cuts and not the party of ifs and buts Ifs and buts Spectom then we're writing our way if we try to out spend big fat tippony or rush to Geneva to cut a deal will crash off sure I don't you like that if we try to out spend big fat tippony or rush to Geneva to cut a deal He was a poet and didn't even know it and then did he ever blow it now?
