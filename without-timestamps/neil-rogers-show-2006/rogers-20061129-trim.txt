Oh, please And we're gonna take a potload of calls today, believe you me and I also got the sea I decided At least for the time being least till two o'clock I decided it'll be like kind of mix and match, you know, which I think I was doing that for quite a while there remember that yeah Yeah, yeah, take a few calls, but not too many and still have a pretty good stack of crap here, you know There's not like having a good stack of crap, which I always have you like this story This is where we'll create a lady a mother was arrested on suspicion of murdering her newborn daughter by microwaving the baby in an oven All right You're being sarcastic when you said I'd love it, right? China Arnold 26 was jailed Monday in a charge of aggravated murder more than a year after she brought her dead month old baby to hospital Bill was set yesterday at a million bucks got a picture of China. She's looks like she's been through the ringer We have reasonably we have some forensic evidence that is consistent with our belief that a microwave oven was used in this death said can best Directed the Montgomery County coroner's office. That's in Dayton, Ohio He said the evidence included high heat internal injuries in the absence of external burn marks on the baby Paris tally Sure like Paris so casino and Vegas. I'll take it then arm of his arrest it's was arrested soon after the baby said I do like it Of course you haven't been in there. No, what about Josh you've been in Paris? Yes, I have Milton. No, not Paris. Hilton Jesus What a grotesque thought but in any rate. It's like outdoors. You know, it's got like a fake sky and like all kinds of crap And it's you feel like you're gambling outside and losing your ass by the way, and it got some really neat restaurant stuff like that Arnold was arrested soon after the baby's death August 2005 then was released while authorities investigated further Bed set the case was difficult because did not allow the scientific research and data on the effect of microwaves on human beings I wouldn't think so you think there'd be a lot of research on the probably not not The death was ruled homicide by her hyperthermia or high body temperature the absence of external burns Real out an open flame scalding water or heating pad as the cause Arnold's lawyer John Paul Reall said his client had nothing Do other child's death and was stunned when investigators told her that a microwave might have been involved I wonder if there was room for a kitty cat in there too China as a mother in a person was horrified that Titson I could occur we all said the night before the baby was taking the hospital The child's father went out for a short time and left Paris with a baby sitter we on said the mother didn't sense anything out of the ordinary till the next morning When the child was found unconscious she's about to hear the children I say in 2000 Virginia woman was sentenced to five years in prison For killing her muffled son in a microwave Elizabeth Renee opti claimed she had no memory of cramming her son in the microwave And turning on the appliance in 1999 she had issues she had some problems Here's our full result from yesterday and by the way Rick Shaw's retiring That's where we'd been over that had about the news You know normally yesterday said he was kind of shocked and I was too to be honest with you for a free you know far be it for me to agree with that that's Screamer but he was shocked that Rick Shaw was calling me that I should have been calling him to congratulate him You know, but Chris I didn't know nothing about it. I mean we had the article from the hero, but I mean as far as you know Where would it help us are gonna call him right right like we got that number?

Thank the Lord for that. Thank you God I'll screamer big improvement 128. I hate this poll only 35 2.4% so that's the reason I'm yesterday's poll now today's poll more so many polls and so little time That's why I always look at life guys who and this kind of fits right in with that and thanks to ever sent this in Facts to us this poll and these times somebody sends us a even a reasonably decent poll idea I think them profusely because it is a bitch as you know. Oh, yeah coming up with these poll ideas every day I mean yeah, we go back in the fault. We bring back one. We did like 234 years ago Something like that. Can you believe it's going to be well, how long would you been doing the polls then? Hundred year would know the answer to that how long? How long?

Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Oh, right. Well, speaking of, uh, right that Mr. Manage should be along two to four the second. No, then the power hour with the Humper and the Mad Dog together four to five. What a brilliant programming idea that is. Then we got Hupersolo between five and seven. No games tonight. Path is lost again last night. This time in a shootout in Montreal, one zippe, one zippe. They can't put the biscuit in the basket in the shootout in the shootout. And a shootout. That was in the covect nation by the wet Montreal. But, uh, so we got Hurricane Hotline a game where shops at sunset placed seven and nine in the hurricane craft. And then of course everybody go, oh, poor coach, co-curve, what you really suck. And then we got Craig Nish nine to ten. Little Mitch Marsh, Eddie Kittard. See, again, the schedule still screwed up. Eddie Kittard says a ten thirty. Are we signing off for transmitter maintenance from ten to ten thirty? This clearance boy, this child is just lost it. And I'm sure is not back from the hurricane game last night. There's no way. Is he there? No chance. No, yeah. No, of course not. How the hurricane's due last night in the Northwestern, uh, whatever the hell they did. They lost. They lost. The panthers lost and the hurricane basketball team lost on the same night. Are we cursed in South Florida? Aren't you cursed down there? I feel cursed. Anyway, speaking of curse, but I'll be messing with the microphone again. So if you hear some noise, it's me, patchking. No problem. I used a lot of noise and crap, okay. The audience is used to that. In fact, it's the part of our signal. Stuck in the on position again. So if you hear me, in fact, they go in here. A lot of noise and crap. They threw it around the wrong station. Another former altar boys filed lawsuit and date County claiming that the Reverend Gustavo Miyade, say highly a Catholic priest, sexually abused him in the early 1980. Oh my god. The suit is the second and as many months against Miyade's who resound last month from the post, at highly is immaculate conception church. Not a lot of their child molesting priest. Oh, that's hard to believe. In the first suit, a former altar boy accused Miyade's and the Reverend Pedro Hovey, a fatherly and raping him while attending a summer camp in 1981 at the same visit to Paul Regional Seminary in Boit and Beat. Let me say again, you parents out there that turn your children over in these pedophiles. You ought to be raped into yourself. That'll be in jail. I mean, we'll get raped into it. What's this facetist said? Holy moly. It says if you went on WQM, I'd be December 30th, 1997, you're upcoming at a Versu and Mark 9 years on the station, not 10. Wow. How do you like that? This is somebody that's really keeping track of crap, huh? Right. That can do better math and some of this. And it says, by the way, I was your very first QM caller. I'm sorry for what I started. When your first statement said initial show was, George Corso is God. Funny how things changed. A little bit we know, you know. And that's because he was working his ass off right up to, practically till we went on the year or 10 o'clock that morning to try to paste and punch key and put together a bunch of crap that they sent for equipment that was coming from all over in North America. Also, you recall you being amazed. One of the headhunter's left time at the time of U.W.W.W.M. to view a banding with station and deeming what does that say? And not dealing with any of the, what I can't read. It's chopped off. Oh, well, listen, that's Greg for you, man. When the going gets tough, Greg gets going out of town. And he always didn't need to always will. So it was. And he took the whole family and packed up and went to Chicago. Wasn't it? Okay. I wasn't. Our debut day because he didn't want to be around to try to like, you know, because he knew it was going to be a disaster. And actually it wasn't. We got everything was on the year just fine. And we're going to get back to this travel listing. Please, please. And at handwriting that printing there, it's a real chronic. You notice that? Oh yeah. So not only the first caller that we had, but obviously a real chronic fracture too. But thanks for the correction on it. So like I said, our nine years doesn't seem like 10. And it's like a hundred. And the latest, the 35 year old call your county man who didn't want to be identified. Said me out is touched and inappropriate. And that's the abuse continues for more than three years when he was an altered boy at St. Timothy Catholic Church. I can think of some people I'd like to touch appropriately as to inappropriately as opposed to it. Name this defendant, the Archdiocese of Mining Archfisher John Favillara. Archdiocese officials in the same way. And the last thing I said, they were unaware of late delegations. There were no prior allegations of information that would indicate father me out as did, or would engage in any type of inappropriate or abusive behavior of this statement. Except of course for the fact that he was a Catholic priest. I shouldn't have been a pretty good hand at the first place. It's a sad day when the Catholic Church learned that someone who's been in a late victim of a sexual abuse, they statements said, we again apologize to this alleged victim and pray that his journey to healing may begin. You think that's going to get the job done? said they when something like this happened must be a lot of sad days for the Catholic Church. I apologize. Well we don't care. It's a sad day here because George can't even turn on his microphone now. Really? Yeah. Well that's how you underpotsky that yesterday you like messed around with it with your pocket fisherman there or whatever you stuck in there and now you probably blew out the name pot. If he's not smoking it he's blown it out. The button's just stuck. What? The button is stuck. Right. Like I said that facts was very appropriate boy. What have we tried? George Corso has got an the entire engineering stuff stuff that won't fix the dancing in there because but we don't care you. Puzzle out you didn't want to hear George say anyway. He's such a hard ass. Especially with this poll about body here which he knows nothing about. We had a Sukunopy Beach for come up. Are you babbling again? Are you squeaking in the background? Starting some like yelding. We had a Sukunopy Beach for come up with not among the priest purged by the Archdiocese following me 2002 nationwide abuse scandal there have been no complaints in his file at the time. Well, at a press conference yesterday in front of St. Timothy the latest led victim said he chose to come forward after a learning of last month's lawsuit by the former alter boy known as John Don number 25. I'd hope it to help other children to come forward. He said his voice cracking. I've been hiding all my life that's destroyed me and my family. I can't hide anymore. He needs help he said of me. He needs ass assistance. His attorney Jeffrey Herman of Adventurer said me out he said abuse is client by taking advantage of the voice interest to becoming a priest. Father Mary's did unspeakable things to the unboy telling him that those were the things he had to do to become a priest. Well, I think that was the least honest. Right. He had a perfect. But I did. Practice makes prefect. How did you fix it with my knife? No. I just think I got pocket fisherman. That's right. Herman then produces clients in 1985 confirmation certificate and an old yellow photograph of his client in his alter boy robes. Old yellow. Old yellow. The alleged victim currently lives in cognitive county with his wife and 12 year old daughter. The audience has been a staple at a macula conception church for the past 15 years. A greedy resign October 6 after ruining the first lawsuit, alleging he sexually assaulted the boy in the 1980s. He asked salt to them. For many years I've been deeply plagued by events. Me out his room in the letter last month of personers and highly is a macula concessive perception church. For many he's been a prey. I prayed for God's guidance he said. The only conclusion that I could reach was that I had to be true to Christ. My priesthood and you my beloved community explained to all concern my sincerity great and repentance for any pain brought on by errors of judgment that I have made he wrote by errors in other words he doesn't deny it. There were just errors of judgment. Just like the anazi Pope would have read shoes. He's not pissed off or upset or apologizing for what he said. He's upset that they were offended. So if anybody was offended by the fact that he molested their kids then he's upset and he wishes that God and Jesus would forgive and yada yada. Right? Am I right about that? Sure. And he's sorry he got caught or he still we do it. That's correct. Because that's what a priest. That's a priest number one job. And that's number two job. Number one is to try to raise some money for the business. And number two is to alter boys. By the way, Joe Blumensstein, thanks for your very nice email here. Where is Joe? This is a local thing.

US officials have reportedly asked to pair him embarrassing Americans to leave Argentina who they are don't hear favorites. I'm thinking. The Bush twins. Oh, those embarrassing Americans. Twins, man. Including tabloid tales of nude hotel roms and serious security laughs has gripped the median when his odd days were Jenna and Barbara Bush celebrated their 25th birthday over the Thanksgiving weekend. So we're only coming up on nine years on QM to say December 30th? I guess. Are you sure? 87. No. I mean 97. I don't know what it is. I'll figure it out during the break. ABC News reported the US embassy officials strongly suggested the twins cut short their trip. But they refused it. The embassy called it report false. The embassy welcomes the visit and is provided close support and cooperation that said the same or released to the media. The headlines, dominating TV and newspaper coverage and our Argentina involved that theft and Barbara Bush's purse including her phone and credit cards. It was swept from beneath the restaurant table despite the presence of secret service agent to obviously were like watching her boobs or something like that. There were flashy photos of their appearance Sunday at a big soccer match and breathless coverage of their dinner out when a fire and gulfed nearby building. Sounds to me like they were. I'm not by aiming. An Argentine template magazine reported the first wins were spotted running nude in the hallway of their hotel. A tale of the hotel staff denied according to ABC. All it fits right in with that family man. Accort. US officials reportedly steamed the twins rough staging newly arrived US ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne. They were steamed about it. The White House wouldn't come. Kind like the kid in the microwave steamed. ABC also said security was so last that an network producer Joe Goldman was able to wander up to the twin to chant lobby of their botic hotel spotting into a large play class window on Thursday. He reported that Barbara was typing out a computer and Jenna was sitting on a nearby couch. No one stopped him from approaching him. An Argentine TV station reported that Barbara had left to return to the west but couldn't be confirmed. Well, we'll be keeping it to that on that. I'm sure that everybody's on edge of their seat about the dysfunctional bush twin. You know it because that whole bush family man don't do as they do. Who is they say? WQA and hello. Well, yes. Hi. I called you yesterday Neil and I was to play the bridge tender and you set out to the break but I never heard it. I played it later on and I said I hope you're still listening. Oh, I'm sorry. I have a lot of people on my office listening and I am your most ardent female listener. Right. And you need to play it again and answer is absolutely not. See this is another reason that I don't care for techniques calls as much as some of you other people do. And that's because we get crap like that. And I'm supposed to feel bad about that. Do I feel bad? Didn't I say yes today? I hope she's still listening. It wasn't that much later on. I said, remember I forgot to play the bridge tender for that nice lady. And I did wind up playing it and she was listening. Well, I'll teach you to turn off. Honey. There were a lot of people in the office here listening. I hope everyone of Mr. Stenner laughed in their answer for you for being such a one. This is one of the reason why it's so great to be. Okay. Don't have to put up with nagging women. Now that my mother's in the box. Yeah. I do not need to go. By the way, we got a thousand and three votes on the poll. So take that and put it in your pipe and spoken on. Putting up with nagging demanding women. I want it. You lost honey. I mean, the fact that I even played it at all is like a major miracle because you're how much I hate playing that. You know, because it's a little on the bird outside. You know, it's like old, old like me, old ancient older than the Susan's great grandpa. Would you play the freaking bridge tender because I missed the yesterday. Yes sir. There it is. There it is. The bridge tender. That's all you're going to hear of it. Well, I'm going to play it again. Well, I have to be a maniac to play that piece of crap again. I mean, it was funny 20 years ago, funny honey. Thousands of folks on the poll were talking about waxing and shaving and nipping and tucking and stuff like that. Guys who shave or remove their chest hair generally are gay 301. Narcissistic 134. What's the difference? Easily manipulated by me the imagery 119. Perfectly normal only 115 only 11.4% say they're perfectly normal. George. Okay. It needed attention. Well, if they look good they'll get my attention because you know me, I'm such a sucker for a pretty face and a hot body. Oh, God. By the way, I sure hope that's the right Jacob on in my space page because if it's not, well, I didn't write a main thing like whatever sub Rosa. No, I shouldn't wouldn't do that again. I can't tell because who the help of members when somebody was like 22 now, 32 whatever the hell. Or you know like years ago maybe 10 years ago when we started on QI, 2 AM. Let's see 87, 88, 89, 90, no wait, 97. What year is it? Oh, This is the danger of getting old folks, 98, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. It'll be our ninth anniversary in December 30. And I said to that. So I said 10, so I screwed up. Yeah, it seems like about 100. Because this last year especially boy, it's been a real, but, you know, everything's coming along just fine. Now here's the fact from Susan, case says, I came across some old tapes I made of your first show when you came back on after those seven months off. It was fun to listen to you, Ron fire. The media was there. We were all so mad. You were back. Best of all. I was glad to hear prison bitch with far signs. You how you corrupt our minds. Love suits, love you, Susan. And see Susan is saying, Would you please play prison bitch because she knows we can't play it? Can we? I don't know. I don't know. They say I love his tab. I don't know. I'll think about it. I'll listen to it during a break or not. But anyway, thanks Susan. Happy anniversary to me. That's December 30th. Birthday in November 30th. And the anniversary December 30th.

See, this is Julianne's great claim to fame as they'd cleaned up time square and made it like a really very like Disneyland North, Disney World North. Who the hell wants to go there? Although I would like to see if I'd weren't that bad. I'd like to get some of that great pizza like I'm 40 seconds straight. Boy, no pizza like that. Don't start with the food again. You'd be pleased to know my last one. Oh, yeah. And down you like 600. Okay. Good. Because I can't afford. I mean, just can't function when you get to a certain point when you get to be two. You know, over the line, when your blood sugar is like the machine just says, tilt on the bad machine. A thousand and twenty-two, but sometimes you thank God for taking these calls again, although that one lady, I started to say you interrupted me because you have your mic first again. I started to... They call me and request something and you don't play it immediately. And then I just knew it. I knew it. I even started. Didn't I? Didn't I just... I'm actually saying that listen to them. Well, too bad. I played it for you, honey. That's why I grown when she calls like, oh, geez. Because it's going to start a chain reaction to people calling up for requests. And if you don't do the right, you know. Like they've turned talk. Yeah. Well, that's coming up right after the break. Or maybe not. The biggest name. I'll say that. I'll say that. If this is real Roger's, force radio 560. You a- And... Did I see the way he said that? That's right. That's to keep you on your toes. Well, screw high. I know that the Lord even loves Neorodres. It's time for church. The shielding gets to what's really deep down inside of you. And now here's your host, Colin Cornwallis. Good evening. I'm Colin Cornwallis, your host. And welcome to Tertalk. The loaf lines are already lit up. So let's just get right down to the phone. That's not the video we're talking about. Isn't it? No. What is that thing called? I give up. What's it called? I've heard something. To your complaint. I'll tell your hard complaint. We'll see that's another thing. They call it in a reclassionally. And they don't know the name of the bed. It's our job to know the name of the bed apparently. Well, I see. Thank you for calling us this Tertalk. And I'm happy. I just picked up my 92 score from your life. And it is on two turns in the back seat. Are you just turned? Yes. And there's one in the back seat? A-terr, a paper-a-p-a-human turn in the back seat of my call. Bam, I assure you our guy is just not taking it down from your car. If you want to bring that car back, then we'll take a look at it. You owe you one thing to look at. My car is fine. It's that big-and-turt in the back seat. Okay. What would you like me to do? I said, okay. How about I'm going to your house and pick a local. You can't talk about it. Bam. Bam. What would you like me to do to fix the situation? I want somebody to come over here. Get your car out of my back seat. That's not going to happen. What do you mean? You can bring the car here when you take a look at it. I am a greener back there. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna take the dump in every last car you got there. I'm gonna peel your counter. I'm gonna do it all. Okay. You know what you feel? I got a big girl in there. It probably came out your way. Oh, yeah. I don't make it a habit of going on and taking a dump in the car. How about 400 pounds? That's your turn. That's my turn. That came from a 400 pounds. That's a 400 pound man. Either that or a gorilla. I'm driving this car right to my lawyers office. And I'm gonna let the whole world see you're gonna be on the news this evening, buddy. I'm gonna get seven on my side. What? You're gonna be on the news. Can you describe the pieces? I mean, what does it look like? You know what it is? It came out your ass. What's that hell? You can't use the word counter. Ask me what color. I say what it smells unguided. That's what it smells like. It smells like you sold your ass to the devil. How many of them have you to have? Well, these are how long is this? It's not as long as my arm. I don't think it's that wide arm. This is not what I got to have. Damn, two more four in that back seat. You know, I think it's actually this operation. It's two. That's what they're like. I love kids. I run it away from it. Oh, my god. How bad are you all fine with money? I'm fine with you, okay? I'm fine. You're fine. I'm a fear wheel too, else. All right. How long does it look like it's been sitting there? It's been just coming off of it, okay? Hey. Do you want to come with a home? Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I can't give. I can't give. How long is that? I am taking this is a fresh turn. Okay. What you need to do is you need to bring that turn back. And we'll match it up. We have a line up. We'll match it up with the with the other turns that we have. Well, what you need to do is learn how to use a port. We say, and I can bring the turn back to me. No. You know what? Is the sample? No. I thought it would like it. I'm going to keep it as a pack. Well, keep it. Because it's a nice, you know what? Is it nice conversation fees? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I would mount it on your mantle. It would be a good idea, you know? Nice conversation fees. When a company comes over for the holidays, 1048 at 5.60 WQAM. It's the end of the thing about taking the calls. Now, just like you said only moments ago, they start with the siliance request. Who the house set it was all request holiday time? I think I did, right? Oh, yeah. I don't really care. Hey, whatever they want. You know, it's their show. They're going to manipulate it and deal with it and screw up with it. And whatever they want. You know, you know, you're going to use it chew it up. Right, whatever. So as we get paid, that's all we care about. And in your case, any much, 145 votes on the pool, boy, about guys who shave and wax it and smear it and whatever they're doing with it. Lot of votes on it, pull the day. I don't see any calls on the board. Now that we got your calls back on here. I don't see any anyway, so. Any why? I don't see anything on my screen. Oh, well, that's because your equipment is all bald up in here. Because George Corse always the anti-Christ. And I had the part of it right. I knew we had something new with that whole religious stuff. I thought I was asking about a new computer. I don't need a new computer. Just need one that works. Could be an old one that people you have. That's what it would work would be good. And maybe an engineer that would go in there like fix all the problems that we've got in there. And food in that pool. So damn good thing. I don't come down there to do any shows. No, mold because I would really raise the roof. I would raise holy hell in that place. But nevertheless, 560, see this is what happens. You go to lunch with Joe Bell and he tells you everything you want to hear. What happened? Did anything get fixed in there? No. No. How to good lunch. Well, that's good. 560, 0560, pound 560, Verizon singular, wireless lines. Oh, the panthers at the Ottawa Senators tomorrow night. How come they're not coming to Toronto on this trip? I'm sure Gildy probably want to take me to Ruth Christopher. Nice to take. WQAM, hello. The new plane that would you? Yeah, okay. WQAM, hello. You want to go? Yes. I don't know if you're going to. How do you like that? Not fade away again just like yesterday. WQAM, hello. Can we go for three for a track effect at QAM? No. Yes. I got a big old night collar. It's just waiting for Susan Gray to grab it. Okay, great. That's Susan Gray, I'm going to. Who? Don't you have your member? No. The chronic. Susan Gray. We don't even know who the hell Susan Gray is. Did we figure out who that is? No. No. Thank you. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, listen. About all these requesters, a lot of stuff on your website. Now with the search engines. I'll just go to your website. Thanks. Right. Go to the name website and quit bothering our damn high paid radio show for the. That's right. In fact, I don't know if she would. All right. Thanks. Yeah. Go to the website. On the bridge tenders right on their devices. Right. It's free. And don't have to screw up our show. Kind of whole office full of people. Like, you know what? If I had a whole office, we're all full of people. Gathered around a radio here. Some stupid 20 year old bit from a talk show. I'd probably want to, you know, fire the rest. The first question I'm going to be answering is when how did they start doing some work? Oh, they're all gathered around a radio. Yeah. Right. They're gathered around a radio to see if you can get me to play something again for the second day in a row. And I'm not going to do it. Isn't that what the purpose of it was? Sure. Probably got a bed. They're probably taking odds in the office. Well, let's see. I bet you attend a one. He don't play it. What is it? 18 years within an station now? Feels like it. Oh, it feels like 175 years. And Joe Bell called you. He says they want me to be on a station as long as I want. In other words, for another 100 years. And he liked that. He actually said that because, you know, Joe, it's always kissing kissing. I can't. I can't do it. I'll just picture here of what Jacob, on my website. I'll tell you one thing. I'm going to show you some real true emotion. And I don't even know if that's the right person, you know? So what? That's pretty cool. He looks with me. I don't care if it's the right person or not. He looks like a fine human being to me. Maybe I'll find out who the hell that is. But anyway, he's on my wallpaper now on my desktop. I stretched it and yanked it and twisted it. He's on it. Sweating on that big rock out there in the last montagna somewhere. Up by Vegas. And anyway, it's just one of those things. You know, that's what life is all about. But like I started to say, for me to take Brady Quinn off of there and put somebody else on. Who's eating that all is close on for quite a lot. And the pictures from a pretty fair distance too, you know? Always be suspicious about people get photographed from a lot of 100 miles away. All right, a real suspicious about that. Ever do that? You see somebody like walking towards you down this morning. All the time. They're really hot this time. I'm in a shopping mall. You're walking the mall. Totally. I'm in a shopping mall. I'm in a shopping mall. I'm in a shopping mall. Are you there? You're making you crack at me. I'm using your favorite FedEx fan out here on the road. And you're making my day.

But when you rip into them, that's what makes the show is so funny. I mean, you get like 10 to 15 minutes of. Of a. Of a good laughter. Just listen to you. You know, put a how do you like a bitch like that that I call she calls you. I said I played the dancing for which you're nearly. I was just like crazy as you know. You know, young Neil, the bridge. Tender those old things. I don't want to keep playing over again. We've killed them over the years. You know, I played a thing for a few minutes. I apologize for the fact that I hadn't done it right away. And I forgot, but it was not that much later in the show. I already shut off. You know, yesterday. I heard the show yesterday. You did play a little later on. It was fine. Everything fine. I don't think that. I'd like to say our life in their ass off at her. Yeah. What a stupid bitch who water. Happy holiday to you and the staff. You make it all the way. Take care of your package. Okay. Bye. 5.67056. You this is a FedExcribe. Well, we love FedEx and we love UPS. Yes, we do. And speaking of my package with my fetched machine. It didn't hear yet. I'm hearing that it's going to be here tomorrow or Friday. But it could be here today. So I get my clothes on. Well, I kind of accelerate things. You know, when I phone rings after one in there. Or there's a package on here for you. And there's like a $14.60 costum as you know. I don't. I'm not that that customer singer. I'm going to like start protesting with that crap. It's already been paid the postage in the ring. I'll just cut the crap. Which is another way of stealing. Fleecing money out of the public. That's all. Our customs my ass. That's brutal. 1967 votes on a poll already about guys. They'd like wax it and trim it and shave it. And they're a chest too. Guys who shave or remove their chest here are generally gay. 327 is leading the way. Our sister won 41. We did leave something on. What's that? Well, we can add it on. Young. They're the ones that are doing it. Hung? Young. Guys who do that should be hung? That's not what I said. Oh, young. Why didn't you put young? You put what I mean, you want on there. You're the guy with a power there. You got the, uh, your finger on it. Josh's doing it now. Stick it on there. Josh young. Well, Josh already admitted he shoves it. Our sister won 41. That's because they're these like it. You know, I mean, what a worst man. Well, he's like it. Jesus God, that's pretty sad. The fact that you've had like alter your body in order to please some, you know, Bimbou to get what I want me? Yes. Good, good thinking. Easily manipulated by media imagery 125, perfectly normal 18 like Josh, perfectly normal. Well, in need of, uh, attention 85 insecure 71. They're clean. They got a clean machine mine 54. Yeah, likely story. I hate this pool 50, 4.6%. Those are the guys that are shaving it. Believe me. The range 40 show us 38 and sexy 18. And what kind of guy in this audience would say that guys who shoot their body are like sexy. Yeah, I'll tell you what kind of guy that's gay. That's the answer I was looking for. The fan of black ones. So best talent with the faces. Now for the drips. 10 years early, radio 560. Yeah. This is the new one of your show. This is the brain. No, no, no, no, no, no. Any questions?

Pizza is being believed. It's 1102 at 5.60. W.K.M. So Joe Bell tells me that he was really looking forward to talking to an normal kid again. Because last time they spoke, normal told him that he was really impressed by a clearance and what a cute ass he had. Oh yeah. Yeah. Actually said that. And I thought to myself, hey, normal. You're fair. But then again, what a surprise that is. Lawmakers will try to see what they got about normal. Okay. He's got bad eyesight. Lawmakers will try to tackle the state's property insurance crisis in a special session in mid January. Governor like Charlie Gay, Chris and legislative leader said today. In a wide-legged, expected, says it will start January 16, legislators will consider proposals to shore up the insurance industry to prevent companies from dropping wind storm policies. They'll also try to oververt some of the dramatic rating increases for a homeowner's scene since the active hurricane scenes of 2004 and 2005. Homeowners from Pensacola, the key west to be more triple to gentlemen's rating increases and demanded that state policy makers figure out some way to stop them. Stop the crash. Stop the insanity man. The special session will take place less than two months before the survey regular legislative session. A special panel appointed by outgoing fan ask Governor Jeb Bush recently made several recommendations for potential legislation. One of the major proposals is to make it easier for insurance companies to re-insurance through the state's hurricane catastrophe five. That's what we need a QA in man. A catastrophe five. Because make no mistake about it. This current sales department is a catastrophe. How can we not call your sales manager to come in here and like straight now? Who wasn't there asking about that company problem? Oh, Hank stuck his head in the door. Thank you, Rero. As opposed to that. That was funny. Yeah, he stuck his head in the door. I hope you're jambed. It's sharp real fast. No, I just pushed it. Squish it like in the L.A.S. Squish the fish. Now let's see. Speaking of the squish the fish, the Patriots got the lions. They got a forfeit this weekend. And the dolphins played Jacksonville. I was at a home gamer in a way game drive. That's in a way game. Yes. It's in Jacksonville. And what would you say the fish wasn't their chances of winning their game? I'm going to go not very good considering they've won for one Rero. They won for a roll in quite frankly against the mostly girls teams. They beat the bears but then so did the Patriots. All of the Patriots like life and death. Not that I was nervous during that game. I was just dropping loads all over the sofa. Good God. Man was I nervous about this. Especially after they blew that 10 to 3 lead in the gut to be 10 10. I thought, oh boy, here we go again. By the way, that's a home game. My bad. Well, you have real problems with that whole deal. You know what? It's right there. It's right up the street for more of your asses are sitting right now. It's right up the street there. It could hold used to be Joe Robby Stadium. And when are they going to get a name for that? Oh, that's right. I'm excuse me. It's dolphins stadium. Excuse me. I get it right. What a chinsy deal. Pro player. And here they had it out for what about 100 years. Name that for a company. It's out of business. I think it fits right in with the ambiance of the organization. A thousand and ninety five votes on the shave your hair pool. That's a beautiful thing. I will confess that once upon a time I did that. What was the occasion? Oh, it was an occasion. It was like 31 years ago. And I just, I don't know the spirit of being gay. Yeah, I was in West Palm and JNL. Had a hot date coming up. Well, I hoped. Okay. No, that's usually the occasion that people start grooming. No. A federal judge in Los Angeles who previously struck down sections of the Patriot Actors ruled that provisions of an anti-terrorist mortaristian by President Bush after nine, 11 are unconstitutional.

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah I'm like other products in the market. If you instant confidence and safety in snow, you're icy walking conditions. But won't ruin your hardwood flow. If you're the same solid predictable grip, you're accustomed to feeding. I'm dry services. That's the same predictable grip. You're that Jacob? Yeah, you use them on your shoes. Oh. The unique patented coil, coil design provides standard safety to ease of traction and packs no nice. Well, there you go. So there they are. Right over here. Just in case when we get our first icy day. And we may not get any icy. That's the first day I encountered like that in all the time I've been back up here up north. Mm-hmm. And it was just a slip-in-side. Although I didn't manage to get back here on one piece and break any bones. Nothing like that. Always you get older and older. You've got to really be careful, man. Oh yeah. And that's another thing. Well, if you took a real slip and falling your tailbone, that'd be your hat. Ooh. Yeah, I thought that'd be my hat. Yeah, that's what they said. Backdome. That's exactly what it would be. And anyway, it's 21 past 11 life is great. Everything's coming along.unky, do we? Everybody's happy again now. Everything's under control. As of this morning, more than a million of the Florida Lattery's new holiday, a million air raffle tickets have been sold. As of 730 this morning, just 240,000, 335 tickets remain for the January 1 drawing the Florida Lattery said. Only 1.25 million of the $20 tickets will be sold, producing the best odds of any game of the lottery's ever offered. And of course, they're running spots on our station for this thing. So the holiday, a million air raffle will be heard those spots? Yes. So naturally, we have to say, this is a great deal. 10 lucky ticket orders are when a million dollars of course, if anybody in this audience wins a million, I get a chunk. I get a piece. And then I share that with George and Josh. They each get like 1%. I'll take another 10, we'll win 100 grand and 100 more will collect 10,000 each. That makes the odds of winning a million dollars, $1,125,000. And the overall odds of winning a prize just $1,9615, not bad. Certainly better than the odds of the Rario lottery, which I wouldn't wish on Heinrich Kimler, okay? Or Hirman Gearing. You might mention my name to Rice Master Jerry. OK. 1147 votes on the pool. I think we're going to need to $1,200 by noon. 12 by 12 wouldn't that be something or what? That would be kind of like the size of my ass. 12 by 12. 1147, where I ask you about guys who shave their bodies today, not their private. It's not their or that. That's the dual-cost double school. Guys who shave, say, see, this is the one thing about Joe. That's why you guys have got along so well. You both stubborn as hell. Right. Right. That's why he got divorced. Something to read the thing about. It wasn't because he was shaving. No, it's because he's a hard ass like you. That's why he's a hard ass. He stubborn as a freaking muelman. OK. It's a good guy, but stubborn as a muel. Yeah. Guys who shave, slash remove their chest hair, are generally. And the number one answer, gay by a mile. I made three of them. $354, say they're gay. Narcissistic one-fifty. They'd like to look at themselves in the mirror. Oh, don't I look pretty? Oh, pretty. I bought a book or shmoo. Easily manipulated by me, the imagery, 136, like those naked pictures of Brady Quinn. I mean, this goes you guys are looking at those pictures. You're not going to look like that. No matter where you're shaving or what you're shaving it with, believe you may. And if you do look like that, send us the picture. Until they find out how to shave flesh. Perfectly normal 125. That's what Josh Cortis would tell you. They're perfectly normal just like him. But I bought it. In need of attention, 86. In secure 75, they're clean 61. And who'd like a clean machine mine? You know, if you find some of this like really clean, and you want to like lick over every inch of their body? Hmm. I hate this pool, 59, 5.1%. The range 43, the range like me, 43. I'm crazy in an admitted. I'm proud of it. There's showoffs 41. They want to show it off and I look at it. They're 65, 18 and they're young three. See if you put young on there. Three. One of the young guys don't shave their body unless they're like old queens. You know, right. Would you never knew what that was all about? I tried to explain that to you. What? Like old trolls, old queens address of a, you know, a track would like, you know, t-shirts and everyone who looks like they're 20 years old. They're straight at the same syndrome. You know, give it up pops. Yeah, cut the crap pops. Okay, you're an old fart and quit trying to look like you're a teenager again. You old, uh, fair you. God, really an always a crap bottom. So it's tragic is what it is. It's really exciting. Greating and embarrassing. Oh, I wonder if it works. 25. Let us know. Yeah, I'll let you know in the snow when the wind blows. Tell you what works for the old straight guys. Never say it. Money, whether you're shaved or not. Oh, I'll say it myself. Everybody hurt. I'm not, uh, I'm not all that keen. And that kind of takes the challenge out of it. You know, it does. It makes it personal. Nobody can do that. Anybody who bucks can do that. 26 passed a lot of it in five, 60 WCM. Your preferred station for the new millennium, whether Joyce likes it or not. Hey, Joyce, that's for you, honey. I shaved this. Yeah, shave that. Oh, I bet he does. I bet he shaved her out.

Coming up tonight, uninside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story. He grew up in poverty and inspired the people who Jamaica with the songs of peace and protest. If he knew that he would one day be the voice of disenfranchised, suburban, white, red boys, he would probably soil himself. He was Bob Marley. Bob Marley is the man! Requite man, he's a young white man. Whenever one of my college professors, who I call the great oppressors, making write some term paper or something, I just know how Bob Marley felt being in a crime written swam all the time. I don't know how Bob Marley does it. Bob Caucasian is another young white man. I mean, how does this guy from the Jamaican get-out know how angry it makes me when my parents will let me have the escalate? Or how I'm filled with resentment when I go over on my self-unfinance. And of course, there's that gunshot. Yeah, hand me that spreef man. When I smoke the gunshot, it is like I am back in the slums of Kingstone man. Even though in my daily life I cross the street to avoid black people man. Jalo! Yeah, see you down at the mall, my brother! Bob Marley, he became the voice of those who didn't have a voice. Not only the voice of those who were just wish would shut up, it's a big juicy sobbing replica show business tonight on inside of a life. It's 1131 292 noon. The sun is shining. It's a sensational day here at QA. I'm believe you made you believe us? No. Bob too bad. And we take a whole bunch of calls right now. We go to a heavy phone call segment if we had any. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. See this is the thing that really just you just wonder. And then of course you don't wonder. No, I don't wonder. Because it hasn't changed in so long. You know, and you can't live in the past. I think all the real callers died a long time ago. Or less most of them. They want to hear the calls. They just don't want to make any. They're not going to be missing. What even the guy that did make one at the first one this half hour was funny. That was the best one. He was pretty good. And he said that. I don't know. They really suck. I think he had a point. He wasn't talking about himself. He was all right. He had a great call from a show yesterday. If you missed it, we're calling on the day that he announced his retirement. And the kiss my answer about five minutes was a really emotional thing. I had to like, oh man. I had to take a hot bath after that. 5, 6, 7. I'm given this number. I want more time. I'm going to a five hour bedtime rant because it just, it just, it's like it always was. It's the same old crap. You know, it's the same old song. And then every time we go back to doing this again, and I say to myself, oh, I know I stopped taking these calls. Because nobody else calls. And of course, it's the same fear for both those around there 400 times a day. And that's it. That's all we got. Let's do guys. Well, it was guys over there. Now, let's have one more again. The Josh was starting about the sometime in March. They're going to like that. And then they got some stink in there. We're getting all better to shape with me or with this station. It's your people over there to spread all the ugly rumors, Joel. Inside, you better have a major dootian that building is what you need. Get a long year of a major dootian out of that waxy building. I think they got waxy build up. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Is there a rock to show? Yes, it is. The question for Neil. Okay. Comination like a sport to the law thing. I just thought he would know more about this. Probably most of the sports shows. A sports question about what? Well, you know, you know, all these, all these here in the other, every other program about Larry Coke and the money they gave them. Whatever. We don't want to show. We don't care about Larry Coke or the money they gave more than Harry Keyons or any of that. Oh. 560560. Pound 560. This is not a sports show. We don't want sports questions. We don't want sports comments. Unless you love the Patriots or something like that, or leaves, or leaves suck by the way. So sick and tear them plain of ruins. They can't beat the ruins. Change the schedule. Tie somebody else. Tie somebody. You might be able to beat. They can't beat the freaking ruins for sir. And the ruins suck. Look at that. Ducks three orders. Two. Used to be the mighty ducks. Not the not somebody. Another winning all the time. Goes to show you. Remember mighty mouse? Sure. If you would have just been plain old mouse, he didn't help a lot better. Drop the mighty. Look at that guy. Oh, that's a chick. Colonel Terry Walbers. Boy, she don't look like a real man. Oh, son. Mighty mouse. So we go again. I did like mighty mouse with the yellow outfit. Anyway, too. Me, isn't it? Yes. Mighty mouse. Not very popular, man. There are a lot of mice more popular than him. And by the way, Lion one still doesn't work in George's equipment. It's still on Gopaskin studio. But nevertheless, I just mentioned that in passing. No complaints. It's just the way it is here at QA. And now he's been that way. We'll never change. WDQAM. Hello. New God. Yes, son. Good evening. Just enjoying the beautiful South Florida weather. I noticed the Canadian friends are down in the South Broward in North Daed area. The fry's that they're better than here. I'm sorry that those friends Canadians. Yeah. I'll be down this winter season. Or you're staying up in the, uh, at a ride. Are you waiting a book or what? Well, I just thought it was trying to get a stocking skill. It's always open to see you over at the track. I know you like to come down the Gulf Stream a lot. I come down the Gulf Stream. What, don't you gonna go in? I haven't been in Gulf Stream in probably 20 years. Well, I saw you with a bill called or at a highly oray stretch. Right. And again, when did highly occult? You own a year ago that is? Oh, it's on my memory. Not that good. Okay. I'll get some help, pal. I guess I'm help. Woo. Just like that kind of called. Yes. I'm sorry. If you don't know, I'll get some help. Woo! Just like that kind of called yesterday about the gingerbread man, back in 18. Right. He saw me eating there, which I didn't have ever heard of the place you could around. Well, I get around. I'm a Gulf Stream. I'd like to go to Gulf Stream when I'm down there. What? And if I am at Gulf Stream, I sure is how to want to see you. I'll see you that. Leave me alone. That's one of the things I'm so, uh, one of many things. Believe me, many. I'm so ecstatic about being here. You know, just to make it easy, can you facts your agenda. Head of time when you come in? Yeah. schedule okay and also I'll put my funeral data on there for when I'm gonna croak. We'll show up on the website. I'm in a shop where my funeral. I have a 10 celebrity funeral. Google Maps links to all the places you're going to be going. When you cross into South Florida there are big billboards. They have the motto of the area on it says, I have no life. What it says, I have no life. Wow. What a place. What an absolute place from outer space. And he was talking about the sunshine how great it is. Well, I'm trying to hear it too and believe me. It's a log greater. I'm just excited. I'm tickled pink. I'll bet. That's because I'm looking at those pictures of Jacob and you have in Vegas. I thought it was because you're gay. Well, that's why I'm looking at the pictures. In listen those pictures who are off of a long distance. I don't even know if it's the same person or if I'm gonna get a response to my message. I don't know who that is. But again, if it's a man, it's what's wrong with living like everybody lives in a little bit of a fantasy world. Okay. That's right. Thinking back to those wonderful days at the hockey games when all those living and breathing, clean, squeaky, bright face people were there. Oh, God. But nevertheless, another private life shaving their body here. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, and the Verizon singular. I mean, I just, I just, we're going to have to start from it was Brady Quinn again. You don't want to settle what he must. Right. Yeah, which I think is so bogus. Although, and no, I'm the one that started. I take it back because he shall be shaped as pubs. You know, because that one picture we got under where he's got his uniform on is like down to his, well, right. I don't want to see nuts. But I mean, it's pretty damn low. Listen, I made fun of Joe Castello and rightfully so by and the young girls who overheard the conversation inside and outside the building made fun of me as a result of it. How young about 10, 12? You're out of touch old man. Really? That's what I was who knows days. Well, if you were out of touch, you can imagine how far out of touch I am over the matter. As far as you might think, though. All right. W 2 a and. Oh, brother. W 2 a and hello. Yes, sir. I love you. Yeah. Yeah. And what's the first part of that? He said it's really hard. I don't have an average of 76 votes on the poll. Anybody that's worried about seeing naked pictures of ready-quini. First of all, he's not naked. He's got, you know, he's got a thing on. Well, I think he's got a thing on. I think he's got a thing on the right. He's got a thing on the right. He's got a thing on the right. He's got a thing on the right. He's got a thing on the right. He's got a thing on. What's he got? He's got shorts on. He's on the phone. And he quite frankly, he looks like he's puzzled. Like what am I doing on this flag website? And then the other one below, he's like, that's the one Scott is all the way down to his knees. But there he is. And if you're stimulated by that, I think maybe he's you know, you're a star cruising the virus stuff like that and have a wonderful life and good luck to you. 21 before noon, don't forget Mad Doggie. Two, we got no games tonight. Panthers lost one nothing in the shootout last night. I wonder if that game is on again. Wouldn't that be something if it was on again here on NHR on your fly? See our flyer for savings on PCR flyers. They're not they're not in a game at the moment. Although we do have the live racing channel, we can play some of the replays from woodbind where the cancel or races do to fog last night. How do you like that? My favorite at the track, speaking of the track, which nobody wants to hear about. My favorite is like I was watching last night on the racing channel. The fog was so thick at Georgian down. When the announcer can't see the horses, you know, the collar race. And the guy Georgian down's at a pretty good job. Like, well, I can't see a thing. When they come in the stretch, I'll let you know. Like that. And then the fog was so thick at woodbind. They had a cancel or racing last night because they couldn't see who's on first and who's on second. Not exciting to hear? What? I wonder where the hell's the NHR? I'm thinking maybe we'd give like a little just a little taste of the Panther game last night. Oh, there it is. There's a little taste for it. And boy, there were people swooning when Dave's straighter, which he's not very good anyway. We don't like David all, but when Dave's straighter was like missing an action or whatever it a hell he went to do games for that would used to be OLN. What is it now? It's called, what is that called Josh? It used to be OLN and now they changed it to something else. Well, whatever it is, it's some other stupid thing. And so when Geldi did the TV, I think I was the who the they play that night. All my god, people were swooning. They were screaming. What is that sound coming through my TV? Speakers, holy cow, it was like, just like that. The biggest name, stuff that's talent. I just didn't expect you to run your grand year on Radio Vise 60. Yeah, get baby. I decided to pull the plug on OJ. Nobody wants to get what he has to say. No. The book of the show was romantic from a guy who was sick in twisted. Shut up OJ go away. Because you had a bad day. You knew people died. The cherry that you know that you really should have cried. You shouldn't drop it. Now once in a sense, there's nobody cares. You can't afford to pay rent. We all want to say. Shut up go away. There's no paying day now for you watching. We didn't know what we say. Shut up go away. How to blame, because ever did a question that the two friends guilty of this. Maybe what office means when you call all those two people said shut up. Okay shut up. You had a bad day. You knew people died. The cherry that you know that you really should have cried. You shouldn't drop it. Now once in a sense, there's nobody cares. You can't afford to pay rent. We all want to say. Shut up go away. There's no way to win. With two or three games so I'll take shut up. Shut up go away. 14 go noon at 5.60 WQM. I'm going to say these shows go by so much faster. They were back taking these great calls again. I'll say that right now. I'm serious. Or no. That's reading this pondress stuff day after day. I don't know how I stayed alive that long. That's that was your motive behind a whole deal. That's it. That's why you kept talking me into doing it. That's it. You can just talk himself to that. The old man can croak and I can like move right into that chair. Or maybe make a nice 50 bucks a week. They're going to move you right on in there man because Joe said you're adequate. Yeah right on into the garage. 1190s people. It's on the pool. I got a feeling we got a 1200 by noon coming out that we carry you understand about 1200 by noon. That'll be impressive. A Tampa man when we start out to show what that's for about the woman at the fried her kid alleged into microwave or daughter. Yeah Tampa man's been charged with torturing and killing three cats he considered nuisance police said well let's run with that. Richard Aaron Wyatt 30 was arrested Tuesday after investigators found that it can't send a trash can or why it's property. He's been charged with three felony counts of animal cruelty. Oh poor putty cat. I wonder if the spokesman was there by Murray. He reported him. He thought he's all putty cat. It looks like he torched one said Marty Ryan on that span spokesman for Hillsborough County Animal Services. He may have drowned the others. I think all three of those are not good. The microwave would have been much more suitable for the kitty cats than that baby when you think. Oh yeah. Now here's one. And there's a this is very sad puppy abuse alleged in Broward. You know how I like dogs. I love dogs. That's your real story was on the news all over the news and if you didn't see the pictures that you're lucky. Really. Yeah. You know you people that mess with dogs and then it's said you're right now. I hope that they bite your ass and you bleed to death. Is that the one with the ears? He's got the thing over his head. You know the that plastic or whatever they call. So you only see the face in the sad eyes and a few little puppy dog. I got news for it. Most dogs are better than a lot of the people I've met in my life. Police thought a propane tank with a handheld torch in his shed and the cage it looked like an animal trap. Lieutenant Brett Bartlett said the tram about two feet long eight inches wide had bur marks on one side and a crot neck crop sees how do you say that the crop sees sure no I don't know will be done on the cast of German the cause of death. Isn't it where they like to check out their neck? Is that what they call an autopsy? What it's an animal? I guess why it apparently told investigators that the number one the cats on his car he bonded out of the O'eyn Road jail on two do that. It was known if he had an attorney. If he admitted he phased up to five years in prison on each count or maybe I'm each cat. I don't know. How do you like that? Here's it's church in cats he taught he's all pretty kid on the scotch and he like burned him. It is lunatic people I'd like to do nasty stuff to animals men and in these are the same people that later on in life they do nasty stuff to people every time you know like Ted Bundy that's right. I mean sounds good I don't know if that's true and I just made it up but I know that I know that Ted Bundy was like that's right and I right it's part of the profile they start off with animals really yeah how do you know that guy's hot documentary. Oh did they perform in the crops on the animal? No. 211 votes. Oh and that pool man I'm turning now that the calls are back I think we've saved the show. I think that Josh court has saved the show when he said you better start taking calls you old fat fat and then what you said that's what I said it was after he can't stay tricked. I noticed that hasn't gone through yet. No haven't cashed you. Really really. Oh well listen I gotta go make a call. Oh Oh, Racy that washing him you. Yeah, but right it's a block away. Oh no. Yeah, well my phone is like a just a matter of fetals. I'm not in the reason. Josh, so we're both we're both going down there. 560. Come on let's keep these phones sizzling baby if you want phone calls make them and I'm not talking about those here for knuckleheads out there. We're gonna have a we're gonna get the knick knick knick crops these under neck. You think the bees could get a knick crops if he had a neck we doesn't have one it's in there somewhere. You know the the fabric I was thinking about this a few days ago I was shaving you know how when you're in the bat room and you're doing various things you think about strange things you know kill time and I'm shaving and I was thinking to myself about the fact that he's married now that he's actually he's actually bedding down with some human being at night and actually maybe even touching her and like oh and vice versa. Sure I'm a good partner and vice versa. Well oh that's even I didn't even think that far. I understand they have the jaws of life right there next to the Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh yeah I got a good line for that but I've been a nice one. Sorry Joyce. Hey Joyce. That's for you honey. Now I'm just I want to apologize to myself for you know allowing myself to put up with her craft. She doesn't know what she meant from Shinal and I'm just not listening to her. There's nothing in my deal. It says I got to put up with her garbage or allow her to like try to destroy the show. We're not gonna let you destroy honey. She made a hell a good shot and guess what we we stopped her right near tracks. We nipter in the bud. WQAM hello. Hey Neil I've been keeping you updated on the popular world grand opening at the new casino. It's supposed to be after the first of the year. What do you got a date? No I think it's gonna be a lot of trouble. I mean there's no reason for you to come down here before that but would you come down for that? What I come down for the grand opening? Yeah they make a line on it. No. Wow. I thought that'd be my theory. Well what do you mean by that? Why would I have to come down for the grand opening of the casino? I can go right over here to woodbind which I'll be doing it to a club to say I have no why don't we need to do that? I can follow you if I want to lose my ass I can go right over here woodbind. Mine and find a bad machine mine. Maybe I'll get lucky and find a good machine like I did on Sunday. There was an unscheduled trip. This is a bad. I shouldn't probably admit this on here but I'll admit it anyway because you're gonna say oh the old man's a compulsive gambler now he's law he's losing yeah right I'm gonna say that. Yeah you will. I'm hearing. Okay. No because you're not getting any of it anyway doesn't matter but the bottom line is this. Well of course you should care because now I mean how many more those checks can I afford if I lose all my money? Oh like I said this uh don't do it but anyway I was not even gonna go and I was like I went to lunch and whatever and then I came wandering back in my regular cabbie who usually doesn't even work on Sunday he was like like parked right by my uh joint here and I saw him and I said I didn't know what I guess so maybe I'll go. How you like that? Now that's bad all of a turn out good because I found the good machine I won 17 on a box which you you probably would be very happy for my going if I said well guess what I'll give you half George it'll sell yeah you go but at home. 127 votes on a poll it's about body here are you shaving it are you waxing it are you like needing it nearing it whatever because let's face it that's such a case so and that's what the winning and I knew it would. We should have made an old demos in this crowd these are all old men. What are you talking about old men we got 900 and uh you took seven our damn what are we gonna my space 797 you took that poll how old are you and everybody's over 50 get out in here to hell we did what are you talking about all right we'll do the demographic pull again this weekend you're so full it was still on record there you can just get them from Eric all right no I can do it from right here from the history how old are you and that first of well that's not the poll see old men like us who aren't dating young women don't need to take a razor to nothing if I was in a young man I wouldn't be dating a young woman okay let's see let me let me see you through I was to to where now this is gonna take some time now so those people on the phone that are thinking they're gonna get right on guess what let's see which best describes you in football program here's what I said you can't tell us spell scum without you m what am I looking for the average demo holder you want to write yourself on the pervert scale on this scale of zero to ten I say about a hundred oh here you go what's your gender and age group it's not that far back we had sixteen hundred thirty nine votes male thirty five to fifty four eight ninety nine now that's not on old you consider that an old fart fifty four yeah thirty five no younger you are quite the range yeah yeah male over fifty five three fifteen old I don't like me and by the way the thirty five year old I don't know what kind of action they got going on but they're probably married and settled down and that date neither male twenty five to thirty four you know it's really interesting because my close personal friend what's his name in Jacob that's on the my spacing there which you I don't even know if it is the Jacob or not hockey games well I think it is because who the hell is the one-on-a-naked Jacob nobody but anyway uh so he's thirty two and single and head of a sexual so he says and uh and I said the judge is more than before to show what kind of a straight guy is thirty two and looks good like that and his marriage he said a smart one right that was the next one answer and an accurate one two right as more of George's bitterness continues seeping through I'm sorry I have a seeping again male twenty five to thirty four two hundred now those are all well two hundred out of sixteen three nine and it's like twelve percent male eighteen to twenty four sixty young punks eighteen to twenty four like Josh's age male under eighteen we had seven that's so that's what we had by the way Miguel says that it is the same Jacob well how does he know that he said trust me I know when I said the same he must have the inside school well what does that mean hey let's what the how does that mean I'm just telling you what I heard it he called it over the little well gonna have to leave now I'm gonna have to nervous breakdown what what do you mean Miguel said it's the same Jacob how do you know he goes to the most me I know so maybe they're hanging I don't have any idea about it right they're power around clue what that means love you Jacob okay now see I the reason I know I can do that is because back in the day I don't even know for some idea do you or on this station what it was a back when he used to come to the hockey games I would talk about him on here and it didn't bother him then see I'm not these guys that are very uptight and talk about him on the year and then all their friends and oh well Neil the old fan and he doesn't care Miguel says to check your hotmail why don't have an email

You can't do this. You got some other projects here that you'd like our network to look at. Alright, let's look at. O-J. Simpsons if I didn't do it. It's the same film, you just came one word in the title. I know for better. Alright, let's see this one. The making of O-J. Simpsons if I didn't do it. No, that's even worse.

I have no life. Now, if somebody facts this in, just wanted to see Michael Richards was about to leave the most troubling incident of his career behind. His policies is having to explain how the comic couldn't consider himself to be Jewish. This is new to me. We all always thought he was. Well. Richards wasn't born Jewish, but said he is considered himself Jewish over the years. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Alright. Technically, he isn't unless he attends classes in formally converts. Last week, crisis management expert Howard Rubenstein, ignores that Richards had shouted anti-Semitic remarks in the full stand of comedy routine, well before his appearance earlier this month, at which he ran Hexler's, with a racial tirade, using the inward. Although Rubenstein, who knows that Richard made the comments, he said that the comedian is Jewish and wasn't anti-Semitic at all, but was role-playing instead. But leading rabbi's note that the man who played Cosmo Cramer on sign felt hasn't converted Judaism and neither of his parents are Jewish. Sounds like a guy to me faced with a new information Rubenstein, I'll say the asked Richards and the, by the asked Richards and the comedian thinks of himself as Jewish and has been talking with psychiatrist. That sentence doesn't make any sense for them. He needs it as Michael Richards. The founder and the dean of the Simon Vsantol Center in Los Angeles, Rabbi Marvyn Haier said, you can't feel Jewish and you can't become Jewish without convertible Jewish. He feels Jewish. He's not, but he feels close enough, right? Yeah. Okay, like the beast said, I feel human even though I'm not or whatever that was. You know, like Robert Creeper said, I feel like a guy even though, however that goes. No one would have said, I understand. Like Clarence said, I feel like a program director even though I'm a a person. 1391 votes over 81. We're going to do 14 easy today and then we'll be on Fatskree, Baby. We'll be doing it. 560, 560.

Just one thing I was in your part of town. I had to win a vacation when I was in Toronto. Nice place. Stay right there on Young Street. And, you know, I got a good view of the incident. When the office is a pub, you could see no nice areas. You've been there before? Many times. Many times. Yep. And do you live? I mean, it's not exactly. You live in the downtown area in the suburbs. Somewhere, yeah. Somewhere. Okay. What's your dress? No. In my phone number, my shoe side. Oh, I mean, yeah. Oh, just curious. How many of the new ones? Which the other night was listening to a Curtis, and they had many more kids live from the heat game. Man, that was terrible. Oh, man. We could went to ProGuer. Wow.

What are you laughing about? Oh, listen, we got all these stalkers. I'm not, I know. I know. Any stalkers, okay. I mean, if Jacob wants my address and phone, I'll probably gladly give it to him. I'd be more in heavy. Looks like he could use a meal at Ruth Chris. Take him out for a nice feeding. Catch up on old times. 13, 84 votes on a poll. We got 14, like we didn't even have to look at him. You don't say we got to lift. Sometimes when you have it, lift. WQ, where I am? Hello. Hey, Neil. I'm sure. Ron Jeremy. Yeah. I was down at Fantasy Fest this year, and coming out in the morning with my body. And there's Ron Jeremy coming around the corner right at us. Oh, my God. I know, my favorite food. He had one of those portable cameras. He's like, hey, Ron, can I get a picture? And Ron's like, yeah, so my buddy goes out, puts his arm on his shoulder. I take the picture. And I'm like, dude, that was so gross. You touch that guy. And he wrote horrible. Absolutely. He does look horrible. Yeah. He's felt by sereney's disgusting and grotesque. Yeah. It was just pretty funny. They'll run into him down there and stay in the days and, like, ah, ha ha ha. Maybe he was roaming without goldstein again. Could be. Maybe they were sure in a double bin. And extra wide. 1384, whatever happened with Alibar. We're going to ever track him down or not. Hopefully not. Although I wish him all the best. You know what I mean? What do you mean? I mean, I don't wish him any. I don't dislike Al. I have no personal problem. I mean, he created a problem for the station at time when you put him on the air. When you put him on the air. When you put him on the air. He keeps saying. You get aggravated every time I say it. They're eating. They're eating. They're eating. They're eating. They're eating. They're eating. They still repeat it. They're eating. What? That it was me. They still wanted to blame me for putting it on the air. Never. They're going to hate you and try to throw you under the bus every chance. You don't need to get them on the material. Okay. George didn't invite him in. I invited him in. Not. In fact, don't you remember all the times I used to call on a bat line? No, hello. I'm on the boat. Same on the first one. Well, thank God for that. I remember that first time I was still downstairs on the second floor. And he came in with a huge family size box of cereal. It was eating cereal out of the box by the handful. Remember that? Oh, yeah. It was one of those family size. You know, like for a family of 10, what was gigantic? Like used to get what was the grocery that extra. That you stay like the extra large size of the dog. Right. And then you bang your own. You'd sack it. Bag it. Wow. I wonder how Jack Bagadjun used to do it at the middlelands, by the way. Speaking of marginal drivers. 1388 votes on the pool man. Hair or no hair or shave in it or a tweezen it. So he ran into a Ron Jeremy. Wouldn't you write that down in your diary? That's like the guy who was up in another Toronto area. And was over at the falls. I guess I was using. Here's my address, palio. Okay. It's somewhere like in a place. In a place with lots of space and my space. So what are we going to do about that? I don't want that bother me. It's just the cross my ass. You know, just card it. Get rid of it, get rid of it, get rid of it, get rid of it, get rid of it. Get rid of it, get rid of it, get rid of it. Yeah.

That was the yahu being all screwed up. It's just one of those deals, you know? It's just my punishment for being an old-fag. Third, as opposed to a young-fag. Third, you have to be a 25-host on the pool. There's the Pope, I wonder if the Pope is shaving it, huh? I wonder if they have to have the same effect on the show. They have to trim air here, air leak. Oh, you better believe it. You'll be a smooth up-missive, take tweezers to them. Yeah. Yeah. Five, say, well, I was just envisioning some of you. Five, six, seven, oh, five, six. Let's get a bunch of calls in here to slash staff our all-though, Moe and Portante, a couple of stories here, speaking to the Pope. This one first, Chubo Lita Fidel Castro, yesterday, missed the opening event of his 80th birthday celebration, and said sending a note to a large gathering of supporters in Ivana, that he was in no condition to court a doctor's to face such a colossal gathering. He'd be illin. In a brief written statement, read aloud, when not in, so hundreds of guests at the Karl Marx Theatre, Castro said he faced a dilemma. Only the man of theater could fit all the invite of guests, and Dr. City couldn't be around so many people. I opted for the very end of speaking to while using this means of this statement, I thought about Gloria and honor as expressed by Jose Marti as well-known, when he said that all Gloria and honor fit inside a grain of corn. Cole. Castro has not also said the US leadership has created a crisis of such magnitude that the American people themselves will all more surely not allow President Bush to finish his term. He went on to say that he had sent Lenin to do events with President Hugo Chavez congratulating him on his efforts to save energy by docking a Cuban program of issuing power-saving light bulbs. We have a duty to save our species, Castro said. Croke already, would you please, you old-turned croke already? Which I'm sure there's some people thinking about me, but that's too bad. And speaking of old-toads who may croke about the Pope, what does he see about 110? Pope ended up the 16-hello mass today in one of the holiest Christian places in Turkey as part of efforts to reach out to the Roman Catholic minority, the mostly Muslim country. And they all the Turks got together and they said, Hub your in-drared, whatever that means. The pun of conduct of the, well, that's in Turkish, you know? I wonder if you went to a Turkish bath while he was there, the Pope, he said he wanted to. You probably went to some baths. The pun of conduct of the open air mass nested at the ruins of a house where the virgin Mary is thought to have spent her last year as Ayyvayazmir, a house where the virgin Mary is thought to have spent her last year. And she probably is showing up on Totina's pizza and on grotesque sandwiches. Security forces at Sierloff, the arena only 250 of it, I guess, attended, making one of the smallest crowds to attend a people mass. The Vatican said the site could accommodate up to 2,000 people. Oh, look at that, some Turkish wives accused of shining their husband may be killed. I'm seeing him right now. How did she shain him? A adultery? By walking outside, looking like that? The Vatican said the site could accommodate up to 2,000 people. Many of those attending held small Turkish and Vatican flags. In bright sunshine, the Pope stood on a dice under a white flower covered canopy. A canopy. A paramilitary helicopter hovered over the crowd as the Pope arrived. And registered guests went through three separate metal detectors before reaching the sacred site. All the guests keys all the time. A military policeman said security deals weren't given out to officers until last minute apparently to keep the Pope's exact route secret. Well, what we do for him? I don't know if that. These are honor killings in Turkey. She's got their smoth over a face to your head veil. A bitch around abused by everyone. I told my family, but they said you chose it. It's your problem. Thank God that the women of the world have been treated so well by the religion. It's all through the ages and a beautiful thing. Yeah. You guys still can't begin to tell you how many women in this building. And I'm building, and which I spend most of the year. I have the burqa and the jerka and the whole deal. Is this, you know, and they reproduce like rabbits. They've all carrying around like 1012 kids, you know. Yeah. Wow. While those semites. Fourteen hundred votes on a poll. Remember the days of the 1400 on the dial that we do FTO, the light bulb. The normal can't show the Jewish Kaufman show. The Mr. Ego show. The Craig Warding show. Oh boy. And the Mark Schibam show. Remember the guy called yesterday and said when I was reading the bedtime stories, it reminded him of Mark Schibam, which I do have. The W. I. The W. I. Your picture caro station presents the Mark Schibam show. But it's much too long and much too pond. Where's nobody has any idea who that is anyway? Oh, can you play Phil Henry, Negro buffet? Oh, you can eat Negro. The bathroom chargis six ninety five a month to hear his bits. How do you like that? It says some of facts here. Somebody, and it's got a squiggle on about him. It's like great, great squiggle. I think this is from gray. You know what I'm saying? I remember how he used to sign the text with that swirl. It was meant that the text would clear the bank. It was like a little sign that it was okay to release the pay text. How come with these guys? Now that we got your bell in there, which I will say this for him. I get paid like they are too early every day. How come they can cover the text now with him in there? Maybe because the billing is way up. Because we got to, I was going to say we all sales people. But I got to stop myself. Right at that point. Because I won't be getting carried away. The light bulb. Oh, man. Just during the last hour of a decade or so, it just stopped and think about how the radio landscape has changed. And now I know. Wow. We've gone from she to she, to the planet to where the rain is. I mean, from all of the southern crap, you know. And of course, like Ricky Tickie Shaw said, he got it into the right time. And he's going out at the right time. That's why I'm taking my retirement pool tomorrow. Don't forget to change that pool. I won't. And of course, like always, whatever they say, that's fine. You know, give them a voice and a chance to express an opinion. And I'll do whatever they want. Which is you want to win a live your life. Do what you want. Enjoy life, baby. Because once you win a box, that's it. Oh, and that's that thing that DVD that you sent with a package this week. Yeah, the one that we're talking about. There are a bunch of them, but that one about who killed John O'Neill. Okay. I mean, you haven't watched that then. I feel like three or four crazy people screaming each other in. And there's a lot of interesting information in there about, you know, the, I don't think I got my own copy of that. Well, believe me, someday when you really really been spoken like the Harold, I mean, just when you just stood off your ass like tomorrow. Watch a little bit of that. And you want to last for a long. In fact, you know what movie reminds me of? What was the movie about where the guy put the drill through his head in the end? Which I do want to spoil it for everybody. So they want me to have time watching it. Powerball hit a guy. Pye. Pye. That's it. Pye. Punky pie. Fll a pie and whatever other kind of pie. You don't want to watch the body. Stop it. Yeah. Because the guy put the drill through his head at the end of the movie. I don't blame him. I wish he would've done right in the beginning. Remember the worth of our student. It was a half an eternity with all the things. With the numbers. Yeah. He broke character. All the mysterious numbers. And the number. He discovered the guy. That's his phone number. Yeah. So you just to go on. Now who would they? I think it all the way to the movie. What was the other movie he made? Reckling for Drain. Absolutely. How can a guy make one movie so great? And then such a piece of turd like that, you know? Oh, that would be like saying, how do we know? And they called a crap on a jappy garbage. And I want to think in mass point. Right? He's made other good movies before. Such an, uh, bananas. Any haul. She'd quite come to banana. Uh, purple rose a Cairo. Really? Yeah. They were all right. Didn't see any of them probably because he was in them. No, he was not in purple rose a Cairo. Oh, thank God. He's not in mass point. You're like in a lot. Take our words for it. Go by it. Steel it. Render. Am I right? There's something very funny. And that was your next point. And it's got a great ending. Yes. Excellent. Scarlet doesn't get naked enough, but she never does. Analysts. But you can use your imagination. I do. I'm sitting here looking those pictures of Jacob. You know, there are some people you meet in life and they're just, I don't know what it is. They've even impressed and you would never forget them. Then there are other people you meet in life. Go you try to forget them. Like, I'm going to say, if they walk away, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. That's just the way this. Like that. Twenty two before two. I'm going to think if that out. Watch it again. What did I have ever happened to Jerry Lee to ask you that a couple weeks ago? What did he ask? I asked for you. But you forgot the answer. He was a man who was, as a matter of fact, the day that you asked me that question, they were going to be in town at Revolution the very next day. Now he's here in one of the boys in the band. He's the lead-o singer. I know it. I mean, it's just, it just keep moving along. They got a joke man. And then you missed it. And then nothing. But he isn't making any more movies. And what about Jennifer? I'm coming. I'll come and see her. No, I just can't. I just can't see her. I just can't see her. I just can't see her. I just can't see her. I just can't see her. I just can't see her. I just can't see her. I'm just showing the break. Who will look Jennifer Conlight? Okay. And see if she's still asked to ask. Ask a few people. Maybe they know. What's the movie I'm supposed to see? Cokeen Cowboys? That's what they said. It's a documentary. Well, somebody will probably send me a copy of it. And I sure hope it's better than Who Be Go John O'Neill. I'll send you a copy. If you walk to about five minutes today, I don't know how to copy that. It's like crazy, peop. You what? That was one of the ones for you. She sent some movies for me and some movies for you. Oh, brother. Who is this, she? It must be the one and hear bridge tender. God bless her. Number 10. Thank God.
