We're all upset man. A whole Muslim world is rattling their spirits. Well, I say is if you're all bent out of shape with that Danish newspaper, don't eat no Danish in a morning and so on. Right. And don't buy in that paper anymore. Right. Don't buy the newspaper anymore. It's a real shame. It's a real shame. Oners are maybe a Chinese junior who had been reincarnated as your attorney general. Alberto Vio 5 Gonzalez Gonzalez the torturer. Abu Ghara. Ray Nepposetic torture moda. And it's like a big mystery as to what he's going to say. Right. Like we know already. No. What a joke. Yeah. But at any rate, you know, this whole business is, you know, we're offended more pissed off. So let's bring some buildings down, you know. And immediately just coddles this whole view, you know, whether maybe they're terrified they're going to burn their building down. Who knows what that looks all about. Very sad. Almost as sad as Greg Co. Texas to hear. Wow. Yeah. Too bad that we messed up all your plans. Just like a testier said to Godfather. Remember that? Right. Messes up all my plans. They're supposed to cheat and win parents. Where come on? Right. Let me just put the audience's benefit. And this is the last time I'll talk about it because it was just for fun. That's what he said. He said when, however you want, you know, do whatever you want. Have a good time with it. Just for fun. It's just a little pull on a blog. And then he writes on Friday, Greg Co. Texas and the Miami, Harold and the even Mr. Whipple being verified by that newspaper. He writes, we're ignoring all future votes and stuff. Lord of Radio Words, declaring the pull ended and naming our random evidence blog champions. The headline on this little thing here, Radio Pull and Stank God. I think what he means is Stank. Yeah, we put you in a sleep. Okay, Greg, co-tex you idiot, you fool me, you shill. He says, W.M. Jim, this is the market's favorite sports radio voice. 790, the ticket stand La Basser is least favorite and Q.M. is favorite station to which we say to all those. Right. How will do you? The latter can't let. Now, see, this is a lie. The latter category was too close to call legit, which is an absolute lie because we know that a 123 on Tuesdays when Ellen downtown Brown started circulating this Daisy chain, Frantic email. Anyway, too close to call legit before being hijacked by Q.M. is the arraggers and his listeners, but that's okay. It's all good. Democracy ain't always pretty, but it forever beats the alternative. Then this line really amuses the hell out of me. The pull was supposed to be fun. Not turn all weird. Anyway, thanks to all the participants. I don't think it turned all weird at all. Just turned the way he didn't want it to turn. That's what it boils down to. It was a Greg that you're on to pay roll over there. You're got your head all the way of Ellen Brown's ass all the way to his neck. Well, why don't you stop to BS Greg? It just didn't turn out there. There was nothing weird about it. How come the other people couldn't hijack with all their listeners? Yeah. Well, they got all their listeners to vote for times. They only got 3,000 votes. Then they fed him to promising. Now, the fact of the matter is that the first time I talked about it on Tuesday, we pulled off to a big fat lead over them. That's why it should have been. You could stick their audience to the phone with everybody knows that. Then at 123 on Tuesday, obviously in the state of Frantic hysteria, because things weren't working out the way that he and Greg Co. takes had planned it. Here comes this email to everybody who's ever born. Everybody never walked into their building. Everybody that ever drove by their building on 441. Let's crush the QAM. And all of a sudden, here come all these phone. He votes. See, their phone he votes were fine. But the problem is that our phone he votes are were evil because that made us hijacked a pull and it isn't the way they wanted to turn out. You're kidding, nobody Greg Co. takes. It was a bad idea. But anyway, didn't turn all weird. We just kicked your ass. We spoiled all your fun. Just like Tessio. And of course, remember what happened at Tessio? I'll see him no more. Okay, Greg. What a jackass. It's just so typical of the hero like I said, you know, the whole newspaper over there is in bed with the other guys. And when everything they can, they'll do anything. Like Joel Fineberg said, I'll do anything in my power to kick their ass over there. So hurt those guys to wound them. Nobody said. I thought he said. Yeah. Well, you don't have food there already. Do you know I was? I started a little bit distracted. No, I'm just a right here. I thought maybe it was a super bowl last night. Maybe he lost some money on it. Yeah. No, Josh made a good point. That is, that game seemed. Oh, yeah, the officiating stuff. I'll see me out. Watch the whole second half. But the officiating always sucks. I mean, the papers could scream and hold, but then again, they gave away that game. Man, it's a Denver. And the same thing, what's the final last night they gave away the game too? And poor my comb from standing there looking fatter than ever on the sideline. I worked up into a sweat. You know, he's been eating his cheese. Oh my god. Talk about a sweating cheese head. He, I think he had like about 50,000 brought worse too many when he was in green. I think that put him over the edge. But anyway, he was like looking desperately on all those charts and finally to the end of the game, you'll call it. You, I, I just give up. You'll call it. I was like, that was the end of that. I did like that Randall L.T. So that was a great, you know, the man said, there was about to anything mad and got right is that we're going to run a trick later between the 40s. Well, man didn't get a lot right these days. Now he's a little longer than the two. And then of course, toward the end of the game, they're going out of a well. They got it. They got it. They got it. They got it. They got it. They got to get some points out of this. I don't, I don't know where the logic is. Now, because either way they were going to have to score a touchdown and they're all way down there inside the 30 yard line. I got to tell you, by that point, I was completely drunk and me and my friends were saying did he really just say that they should kill? Well, maybe he was going to put the next one. Maybe he and Al were both a little longer than probably here or the can. But then he writes, so then he is 27 seconds left and they don't try the field rule. And both of them adore that they have been saying that. They've been saying that for like about three minutes. And then they finally didn't try it and they're like, but it just ignored it. It was, you know, it was what you expect a very marginal game. And like you said, or we didn't at all, it didn't seem to have the flavor of the Super Bowl. It really did. I mean, it was just probably because Pittsburgh's Seattle, but it's two things that nobody gives a flying crap about. I thought the students were crushing them and it would have actually did molestim if it would have been for that bad pass by Rothel's Berger there. They're like inside the 10 yard line and he's got a guy wide open and said, just lobbing the ball over the defender and automatic easy six, what does he do if he was right in the defender's hands and sets up 14 10. Well, Lisa made a little or seven anyway. That was a nasty pass. You know, that was bad. And I came home from dinner. I went up dinner to watch the first half and I came home just in time and it was Mick Jagger on my screen. And you know what I thought to myself? What's that? I don't want to see him no more. You know, maybe on the only one. There, there are just some people and I like this tone just fine. There are a lot of great music. But that was like in the earlier lifetime. That was before most of our audience was even born, you know? I just don't want to see them no more. You know, what, what is enough? And I thought, ready with him. I kind of agree with you there. I have no problem with him. I like their music. I mean, what are we going to do? Haven't come out in a wheelchair someday? Here are the stones in a wheel with a bag. You know what, a colostomy bag? I just, I don't want to see them no more. You know, there's some people. You want to see no more? And there, there are some of them. And anyway, we have 2,000 and 50 votes on our polo with a weekend, probably say, who's stuck there, about the sports intensive question. How much of a sports nerd are you? And here's the result. Lot of liars, by the way. As I'm a fan, not a nerd. 670. Oh, right. We believe them. How am I going to say? No. Part of them. Some of them. About 10. I have some interest but not big time, 542. Yeah, that's my feeling. Yeah, I can take it or leave it. Men's a men's. I hate everybody. 187, which has nothing to do with the pool, but just a chance for you to vent the fact that you hate the whole world. And that's good. Because there are, don't, don't, don't. Some people like that. I have no interest 120. That was George's vote. Who did not watch one second of the game last night. Right. And by the way, like a point out, I didn't watch any to commercials. Every time I came to commercial break, I put the channel through a something else I want to see for a minute. Total nerd 99. Total sports nerd 99, which is only 4.8% of this vast audience. But we, I think we need like about 20. All taught, all sports, all stock stations in the market then. It'll bring it'll attract someone like flies to honey or bees is it, whatever it is. Flies to wish for a file. It'll bring millions of people to sports, right? I'm sure it will. It's like if we have 75 countries of stations and everybody will be a country music fan. That's right. I love to share with the guys 91. I only watched one sport 90. I hate this pool 83. I hate spectators for 70. Only for gambling purposes 49. I'm a jox niffer 25. And is there anything else other than sports 24? I'm sure clearance voted that. No, I take that back, even voted all because even even though that we have a pool. There you go. There you go. Oh, listen, I'm a little bit slow going to be a little over eight years. But I'm finally seeing what you said in the Friday was absolutely correct. They don't know that we do a pool. They don't know that great co-text did a pool in the newspaper. And I got all whipped up and I apologize to myself. Although it was a lot of fun and we accomplished a lot. We made them look like train monkey. I was kind of fun. Or it made me look like untrained monkeys. It was fun. Because the rest of the crowd, we don't want to. We don't want to. On this station, they'd like, you know, they've just always the old, the old Jew, the old Jew bag, as to carry their mom's back. And I've been doing it for a long time. So why should anything else be different? You know, I'll let him do whatever he wants. What's the kind of do it sports? I thought that's what that pool was all about. Was sports though, wouldn't it? And nothing to do with us. What? Yeah. But what's all the wine? No, you're right. There's Jose Jimaine is a herbabillusia's union. I said, Wilson. I said, Wilson. Yeah, you look just like Woodrow Wilson. I mean, that's who Bush reminds me of Woodrow Wilson and went wine-style Churchill. What a joke. That is your little redneck dumble. And then it's a little midget here. We don't have to, but I, uh, chill for the torture or crowd. You know, a boogar red for the joke. But they're holding these hearings, man. All the hearings all the time. That's what your government does best. They hold a lot of hearings, waste a lot of good time. That of course kills some good TV time on the 24-7 networks on the talking head networks, right? Absolutely. I mean, absolutely. Probably that's after 10 and 5-60. What's that line-up look like today? Well, let's see. We got Curtis and Curtis and Gildy and Gildy and I'm looking at the week and then Curtis. So, looks like we got three days of Curtis this week and two days of the Gildy Master. Curtis, two before, mad dog, four to seven. Just the Agler's seven and ten. Well, how do you like that sports, man? Jesse Agler gets three hours tonight. And he can't ten. I wonder what that's all about. Well, I know what it's all about. The panthers are on the road. They're at the capstone. I would try to be a gimmie but then the least game there was supposed to be a gimmie too and it wasn't a stumped join up. At any rate, it's a road game so it could be tough. So Jesse Agler's on we can't give Gildy because he's travel day. He can't ten. So he got a nice pristine line up. No games. And you can all rehash the asuper bowl and how they're fishating with so bad. And Seattle got screwed. And my hunger looks so fat. And Gildy, how are the end of the game was desperate because he couldn't find like to congratulate the himself on the victory and pat him on the back and give a kiss on the cheek and whatever you know. It was it was you're right. It just didn't have that flavor to it. You know, the longer we had the wrong aroma. That kind of put me in a coma. By the way, we will be playing Perry coma and rounded round the hundred times today. That inspired me for a pull I'm taking later this week. What's that? It goes five. I guess we are. Sorry, Perry. Run that goes round round round. The worst hit song of all time. Okay, we might have done that, but still. No, we did not. The worst hit song of all. Never. I guarantee I'll bet you I'll bet you error. Life on it. I think we did like what's on the hate or something like that. It doesn't something like that. Not the worst hit song of all time. But that's a fine idea. It's been a week on. I think we've done the most annoying song. Right. The most overplayed song. Like that. But the worst hit song. We could do that in 7,000 parts. You'll just hear the lists. Right. All the very manual songs will be on there. Anything by. Yeah, Perry coma, though, round and round. That's right in there. It's a contender. That's the one where he's barely breathing. Where he barely has a pulse. It's no one like you guys across the street. 10 14 at 5, 60, WQM. It's day out of my every child. 5, 60, WQM. From the makers of Voltback Mountain comes an epic tale of forbidden love on the other side of the valley. In rainbow reservation. Why you cry? Why you cry? I know. Oh, flaming front eye. I feel you and your friends more than friends. I feel you, baby. The house. Never. Rising long-horn, Ben Friendsants, boy who... Get how you look at me. Well, how he look at you. The proper feather. Purgent now. The TV death operation. And those long trip of a mountain. Excurious, the prairie like never before. As two Indian friends for rival tribes. The Jackagai and Lockedart Ries. Spend nights alone. In the wilderness. In a TV. Eliminated by the flickering campfire. And serrated by the sounds of nature. Oh, brown eye. Oh, good grief. I think milk could you move you predict rest. Read, raise. So if you're safe, who's your chief? Rainbow reservation. Hi, hi, hi, hi. Oh, oh. Coming soon to a theater near you. Ten-nineteen. That's actually kind of cute. How do you like that? Must be a mistake. Must be. Yeah. Anyway, here's the poll today that we got going. And I just made this one up. Just out of my head. Six hundred nine votes. Which of these best describes you? Average 170. Well, that's refreshing. Is it average? One of the mill? 170. I have no life. 112. I have no life. Touch, stud, 44. Yeah, right. Fats, lob, 38. Narodic 33. No one spared me to put Fats, lob on him. I'm able to lead you to call on Friday. I said she found it very amusing when, uh, Yeah, I say Fats, lob. So I put Fats, lob on there. I can relate. 38. Narodic 33. I'm a fat Jew 32. Computer nerd 29. Lazy third 24. Julio 22. Only 2.6% even a George and sister. Most of our audience, uh, Julio's in Juliette does. Not true. All pro-19. Yeah, you did. I said lots. Yeah, what do you think? Stuff up all the time. All pro-19. Redneck 17. Young punk 14. Racist 13. Closet case 10. Screaming Queen 9 is in. You're fairie. Wallflower 9. Chocolate 9. And hateful bitch 25. And hateful bitch doesn't have to be female, by the way. Like for example, Ricky Carlos have the front desk. When you say the fence, the definitive hateful bitch, the post child. The post your child. Anyway, that's our pool today. And click on it. What we're going to do a thousand votes on it again. Did they each are hard out downtown, Allen Brown and Greg Coatex. Oh, a poor Greg. He didn't expect to get all weird. Do you think there was anything weird about him? I didn't find anything weird at all. What was this man's talking about? What was weird is that they wanted to be a one-sided thing. We're only there allowed to try. Right. They could have just a propaganda. They could have had everybody look at this. We're kicking ass. Yeah, you're kicking ass. Angels, baby, you're on. My god, they must all have Roy's over there. Like bowling balls. By the way, Eric reports that we did take that poll April 26, 2004. Well, that's almost two years ago. The exact wording of it. What worst hit song? What is the worst hit song? Top 40 of all the way. Well, I can go back into, oh, that's good. Sorry, we got to get a list. And we'll add to it. Oh, thanks, Eric. Hi, Larry. In fact, he could really help you by telling you what number that poll is on. You know, how we have a number to our history. Number 1186 and 1187 apparently was a two-part. Oh, that could be like almost all week. 11. Oh, right. That's going to hurt. Totally. He's okay. You keep saying, oh, he's a hell. I don't know what's wrong with you guys. You and Jake. Always ripping him behind. He's a black. I don't know why. I don't know why he's running behind. Just jealous. That's all. That's jealous. All right. That's a nice story, it's up nice early this morning. I'd like to get him last night, but yeah. He'd like to get paid for doing something anyway. Well, that's right. You got him up last night. They maybe a little out of order there because he was like eight sheets to the wing last night. Well, that's what the Super Bulls all about. Then he got a paper, a plastered out. Speaking of a performance last night, CBS is their take on. And of course, it's easy for them because they we see to the game. So, CBS has got their classic take. It says they may not have flashed any body parts except for Mick Jagger's well-tone stomach. Oh, I don't have to see any of him, much less his well-tone stomach. He's 150 years old. But the Rolling Stones made ABC glad it imposed a five-second tape delay on the suitable half-time showed. Were you aware of this? I was not. They leaked them. Two sexually explicit lyrics were excised from the Rock Legends performance last night. The only song to avoid the editor was, can't get those satisfaction. A 41-year-old song about sexual frustration. Was that what it's all about? In start, we have ABC editor's silence one word, a reference to a woman's sexual sway over a dead man. The lyrics for a rough gesture include a synonym for rooster that the network also deemed worth cutting out. What could that have been? I don't know, pull it? Sounds like a cock and made me deal to me. It was the first time a network had imposed a five-second tape delay on the suitable. The sensitivity that no doubt reflects a lingering reaction. They're lingering with their finger and their fingering. Or can't say that. They're lingering with extra Janet Jackson's famous wardrobe malfunction two years ago. The Stones probably didn't mind either. It brought a little rock and roll danger to the ultimate safety. If they're lucky, it distracted attention from their mediocre show. Like I said, amen. They are old and staugy and ancient man. You gotta know what to hang it up like me. This is my last show to them out of here. Or, and where you go? People. Outside. By the way, the sun is shining right now. So little tiny bit of snow that we had overnight its melting. No snow. First have a big storm here this past weekend didn't happen. Kind of like, like the on-war word said, It walked on by or blew on by. It blew. Jagger with 62 is still force of nature's strutting and dancing across the stage. As I was a replica of their famed, wagging tongue logo. The vans performance felt ragged. They seemed just warming up during the opening. Start me up in a three-song set of fours no such luxury. The stone shows three tough rockers including the best song from their well-received region album of one of the most enduring hits. Here's one we could have done a Super Bowl one, Jagger, Riley, sitting producing satisfaction. It was their best-most energetic effort ending with Jagger blowing your kiss to the audience. But unlike you two's performance four years ago, to Super Bowl, their set was not an example of a band that it's peak rising and the majesty of the bed. Or you two, when's that gonna happen? I must have missed that. They're rising with their peak? Yeah. Some in Detroit called to city's rich musical history was snuck when the stone was selected. How come they didn't have the funk brothers there? Would that have been great? I'd have watched that. Even if the Super Bowl had more town theme half time shows twice in the past 25 years, this year's more time, trippy can't be for the game. Stevie Wonder was a center, precincting in Medley was hit with an help of John Legend, John Stone, and India, are we? I- I- What's that? What's what? What's India, are we? I read that's a R&B, I believe. R&B, yeah. You believe? I know. You think? Pretty sure. It was a typical monument to access where the stage more crowded than a train station at Russia was marred by microphones at a caseling malfunction at the junction. Brightly-clad dancers hosted in Congress, we went wondering if Portica was angry and geto tailed living for the city, and one port pretending to fight each other. Like I've seen from Batman. Most importantly, the Medley format did a disservice to the musicians they rushed to the songs as if at a fast food service line, without what's of mean was pregame hoopla, and they'd be given five minutes more to finish a few songs. The National Anthem offered a particularly odd partnership, Erin Neville, and Dr. John, they tribute to Hurricane Robert New Orleans, with the tread favorite Eurethra Franklin. Neville, saying half of the song in his feathery soft voice, then was never heard from again when Franklin blew the domes roof off. She'd barely insinuted a microphone. Ha ha ha! By the right, right. You know, you talk about Mike Holmgram's looking huge. Yeah. She-she-she was about your quote. Really? Your reath remains. And she's just bursting at the scene. She's the growing star. How bright. She's one with R-E-F-P, and how we feel that. It was Harry, had like the whole choir in the background. You thought you were at like a black church on some really. Well, that's-how about the choir in the back of where you have a watch standing in the shadows of the Morton yet? They got the choir in the back there. Yeah, but if you're very, very church-like, this... Nice and national anthem. Well, this is a weird, weird song. When you're in Detroit, you've got to pray a lot. Like you can home alive at night. These made it back alive after wandering to 12th Street in the middle of the night. And I finally talked him off the dollar. We look forward to it. I talked both of the sofa. But I was stuck or bet. You can't win. There's no upside, baby. No upside. There's the downside, but there ain't no upside. So I don't play that one when the slots come down here. Play whatever you want. Twice, so cute.

I told you the religion is too crazy, but they're not the only ones. I rate driver torture showroom. Gerald, George Jedis, apparently thought he got a raw deal on New Car. So we applied the Ford Escape. He didn't want to the glass showroom for gasoline on it. And set the North-Dade Metro Ford dealership on fire day police said yesterday. A little bit over the top, don't you think? People getting pissed off, setting buildings on fire. We don't like your car at two on. We don't like the deal. We got our car four. What a crazy people. He caused nearly a million dollars in damage. Scorking around a dozen cars, including a new airport GT heritage fire official said. George Jedis, 56, is supervised over the city of North Miami Beach. Walked away from the dealership Saturday afternoon as if nothing had happened. Police caught up with him a few months away from the dealership in 9,000 northwest 7th Avenue. He was arrested without incident. Police charged him in the first three are some a felony, and with felony criminal mischief, he posted a $500 bond yesterday. George Jedis could be reached for a comment. The management, the dealership manager, the client of the comment. The those who knew George Jedis were shocked and has appeared act of buyers rage. Oh buyers rage. Yeah. Ah, there's a new one for you. A little anger management. He'll be just fine. You know how will you pay for something you don't get it? Right. North Miami Beach Mayor Raymond F. Marin was stunned to hear George Jedis, who's duties include Managing the city's jewels livin performing arts theater could do such a thing. He's a nice guy. I didn't know him to be a malicious or anything, Maran said. He always been nice to me and the pit bulls he knows. It's unclear what George Jedis status will be city will be due to his arrest. The incident played out on a busy Saturday afternoon at the dealership. According to the police, George Jedis was fuming over the pricey ad paid. A new one goes for about 20 grand and it's unknown what pricey paid for a new beige for the Skip SUV. Oh, that's true. On Saturday, he went back to the dealership. It's unclear what he was told, but he was angered with the final agreement. He calmly got into the car, drove it through the windows, and he glass-shattering everywhere. He then doused gasoline or some flammable fluid on the escape and other cars in struck a match. To these crews, another customer witnessed the jaw dropping incident. She had brought her car to be serviced and said she was in line when she saw George Jedis Korean into the showroom. At first, I thought someone had pushed the accelerator instead of the brace pass, and she said that this dude drove through the showroom on purpose. He's creating a drive through a manner a lot of those in South Florida. All of the state, only his only 56. Through his described as seen as pure panic with people screaming, he's got a bomb. She said that once the man was in the showroom, she saw me chillin' the passenger side for something that heard loud boom. Flames were everywhere, she said the place was absolutely. By the way, man! But to her surprise, George Jedis wearing a bright orange shirt and khaki shorts was common, just stroll away. The fire just walked, he just walked on by. The fire spread all the way through the dealership and destroyed cars, computers and paperwork. A mine-acars damage is a rare baby blue 2006 4GT heritage, a limited edition model out of only 250, the made itself for 150 grand. Won't see that no mole. A similar by Jensen happened in 1994 when Stephanie Elaine hardened angered at Peppoy's mechanics, walked in that store sure on the 3388 North State Road 7, and poured gasoline on the floor and then in Blidomatch. He was arrested and charges of arson. For a lot of angry, that's virus rage, baby. I'm pissed off, I'm gonna burn a place down. Yeah, you're like that. And? Yeah. That's just a lead in to these crazy religious nuts and excuse me for the redundancy. Right. I mean, come on already. When you people in the media once again, oh, here we go again. The fear over the editorial cartoons. If you're a see there's the fear, then what he's talking about, Bush again, the fear. Without the mustache.

There's this, this sucking up to religious nutcases, man. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it all my life, but late. You people in the media. I mean, there is no rationalizing. This is no different from any other kind of religious insanity. But nevertheless, media scare to death of anything having to do with religion. We don't want to offend anybody, right? Why not? Oh, because it, in fact, I saw this, what in a tour of cartoons is supposed to be. See if it's, if it's in Saudi Arabia, one of the Muslim countries with cartoons depicting all the Jews with big noses and blood on their hands. That's okay. That's not the least bit offensive. But if it anything to do with a Quran or God forbid with my hand, what about if it was my hand, it all e. Huh? Oh, that's okay. Oh, is it? What about if we take Kennedy, pick him mashed potatoes out of his ears like we just saw no drinking a little while ago? See that? Oh, he was picking buds out of his ears. I wish I could do that.

Just who many seven lemons not see sebepathas or something. I mean, I mean, all the innocuous people in the world, you know, and a lot of them look pretty good too, by the way. Pretty good restaurants there as well, but I have a lot of seven 11. And Denmark, you know, they pretty much mind the world business these days. And, you know, and the so they haven't opinion somebody wrote a cartoon They didn't like like our namesberry to bed. All you, uh, it's a, it's a, it's a nautical ragheads out there. I mean, it, it, it takes a anger management would be good before you blow to hold on world up crazy people. Yeah, yeah, remember each could be real, but these are just the Biblical part. Like that. Yeah. Good, golly. Just take a chilled pill man and calm down. They could have the class right there at the Madrasa. Just like that business at Gitmo when it were like all bed out of shape. They're flushing the corand on the toilet. Wait, you know what all these books says a good place for it. Yeah, probably plug up the, uh, latrine, but nevertheless, the Bible and the corran and the, uh, what's the Joseph Smith, the tablets, take two in college and the morning, whatever those things are, the book, the book of more, more on the right. Right. It's all crap. Get with it, okay. Jesus, come out of the dark ages and join the human race for Christ, say, good, golly and watch the Super Bowl. Anyway, speaking of before we get to that, Megorapur buster rhymes and he can do like bust a move. No. Buster rhymes narrowly escaped death early yesterday where you were this. I am now, you told me this morning. Well, you have a Josh ain't, I heard it as well. As his bling handler was killed in the hail of bullets after several routies were booted from a Brooklyn soundstage where the performer shooting his celebrity stood in video. Oh, man, his bling handler was killed. A lot of dead direct people, you know what? They get a bum rack. Their shooting started our shooting stops at K, a man who was part of the tech and crew for rhymes video version of the song, Touch it. In the kiss the cactus studio and green point kiss the cactus and then touch it or the other way around. Are you like that? A lot of bullets coming out of the bling handler. Oh, yeah. Not a good professional, you kid's out there if you want to be something good when you grow up, don't become a bling handler. So what's somebody touched with my bling, I'll shoot him. Oh, bang bang. Don't have a bling. Oh, look at this, a call coming in here. WQA and hello. And they're not there anymore. That's good. That's a kind of mood I'm in today of these, this whole business with a super bowl. It was just a cock, man. Big gold up. Restones there about 150 years old, you know. Old and crappy. Just get, get, go away already. We'd have played as just go away. How many $20 you think they made already? This you're not doing it for the money. No, what are they doing for it? For the halibut. Let's see, you need that anal to this poll that I can vote signed to somebody. Here, okay, let's add that anal. Got it? Got it. Okay, somebody authors anal. I wonder if they must be Greg Kotzach who's he must be off the anal. If he's all of them, oh, they, we didn't want it to get weird. It was just supposed to be for fun. Well, we had a tremendous amount of fun with it. How you like that, Greg? We had a lot of fun. And it's just the way it goes. You didn't have any fun because your buddy Alan Dowtown Brown and your other cohorts across the street. Oh, gee, Greg, that's not how it was supposed to come out. You promised us you'd make this look like the big heroes and we look like a bunch of mozo. Uh, well, it was us to bad, bunch of silly cry babies, man. Tell me, do you QAM hello? Oh, hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I probably a little late, but I heard earlier you were, you were talking about wolfing's restaurant. Maybe I'm a little late, but uh, yeah, I was about a year ago as soon as we go ahead. Oh, man, it was great. A lot of good year food. I eat there all the time. Yeah. I'd buy the beach there. And the greatest, uh, pickled tomatoes. I wonder if I can do that. Now, these leave them out like the green alleys on the table so you can get in. Okay, well, that's the ancient. It's very boring. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Tom was at Pacific or what? Tom 5, 6th in the Verizon Sea. It was like we need a prayer on wolfies. Okay. And the pickles. How about the course? The cold slaw? Yeah. Yeah. The temperature is that used to tear off their aprons and run out of screaming. I can't even handle them anymore. This is a bunch of crazy people. And like, and throw the silverware down. That was a exciting part. I heard about the stupid, uh, dill pickles. Right. And the liver dip. Yeah, oh. Come in to Q.A.M. Hello. And now. Yes, sir. Uh, this is not a funny to me that last night's civil full was just discussing all the way through. One was the last time you've seen a, um, half time show out before and by the free game show. the pre-game show. You know, it was just for... I didn't want to see the one of them so very pleased. I guess I made a great choice. Well, at the same time, it's kind of funny that, you know, just the commercials stunt, the game wasn't all that great and all that other good stuff. Yeah. I was basically bored. But I feel like we had many while I watched a second half, but I feel like the public had many hours in their life stolen away by hype. How I knew it was a letter. It was a movie game. Trust me. It was all about the whole Janet Jackson thing and they tried to make it as a bland and possible. I know that other good stuff. Now, one more thing. I got it, and I do listen to the Leopard Dark Show. Yeah. I'm one of them. But the thing is, it's a different type of sports show to me being done the fight entertaining and like you know. Yeah, okay. Well, I'm telling you, given back to 50 bucks, okay, because your call was definitely not worth it. Take, I would say... Not 30, 40, okay. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16, not interested. That was last week and this is now, okay. Although a bastard show, I, I, right. That's younger than him. He's younger than he thought he'd be. Yeah, younger than him. He's very entertaining. And how much more publicity can you give us? I won't do any good, okay, because once people hear it the first time, if they have an IQ larger than their thumbnail, they're gone. Anyway, let's see, here's a facts from somebody in Panama, Filly. Not me, Lou. Me luck. It says the word that describes me is not found anywhere today's poll. When you add the word gothic. Wow. I've also wondered how many other people like me listen to your show since we tend not to listen to radio at all. I've known listen to the radio since I was 15, safe from the radio ride to show I'm 35 now. Born in my man moved away from South Florida three years ago, but just to find another god-off authority destination for the most part of what Panama City would expect. For the most part, everybody where I live now are what George had on the nail religious uncrished in types. Those supporting pump as asses, it's such really bad here and that's why I'm moving to Springfield Mass now and hopefully soon. Thanks, Pally, and our love your show says, Me luck. Good luck to you. Put a gaffe gun over the Capitol, please. What's a may luck is that a guy at checks that went between? Let's get laid in the month and follows April. Well, good luck. May that's it. And in your case, I'm like five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty. Pound five, sixty, and leave a rise in singular wireless. I'm going to introduce first of them, you're very entertaining cause. Let's reminisce about Puffer next next. Okay, it about those great pickles these days I want to say. What about the opportunity I've read with all the different answers. I asked it if I read with the poppy seeds. I'm poppy. WQAM Hello. The way I'm yeser. You're showing stuff, you know, the little float of it. Okay, and that's because you're on it. WQAM Hello. Pound that clam, everyone. Five, six, seven. Okay, let me get back to the crazy, uh, reggae. No, I mean, obviously, you know, the test of the waters are a little bit and it was, uh, it was polluted. They were polluted. You could smell it. You could feel it, little brown. If I keep in the waters out, it will be a chocolate to me. Four people have died as demonstrations against cartoons, saturizing me for having a profit in my hemadintensify. What a, what a, what a, what a, what a, what a, like that. It's a cartoon, baby. Well, we don't like it. Three people were killed when police in Afghanistan. Fired on protesters after police station came out of attack. In Somalia, a 14 year old boy was shot dead, and several others injured after protesters attacked the police. Demonstrations have also been taking place in India, Thailand, Indonesia, Iran and Gaza. They followed the tax and Danish embassy in Syria and Lebanon over the weekend. The cartoons were first published in a Danish newspaper. Mondays this would talk to be the first officials in Lebanon who are not confirmed by the demonstrator died yesterday after jumping from the third floor of the Danish embassy in Beirut to escape a fire. Hundreds of people took part in the morning demonstration of Afghanistan's Laghman province and a second day of protest in that city. I mean, thank God that everything else in the world is under control and everybody's doing well. If they got all this spare time to get all Benauta shape about some stupid ass cartoon, oh you can't make fun of me, I'm my hamad and you can't satirize the Korean here. Demonstrator shouted, DEF to Denmark and DEF to France in your pants and called for diplomats and soldiers from both countries to be kicked out of Afghanistan. What's about time to piss off at France? Both France and Denmark sent troops to Afghanistan as part of international efforts in the US-led so-called war on terror. They want to test our feelings, protest your mouly of dual car Abu Azara told the BBC. Boy, got about 17 different names. They want to know whether Muslims are extremists or not. DEF to send the newspapers to you. They want to know as if we need like, we need to test the waters on that, I don't think so. In the port city of Vosaso in the autonomous Somali region of Puttland, police shot dead one protest, even three more were injured. The government's Twitter's two stones in Burkese streets outside their national agency buildings, peaceful protests were held in several other Somali towns. Like I said, you don't want to eat day in the city, you want to buy products made in Denmark, have a great time, okay? This in 40 bucks will buy like a half a cup of coffee and be rude. That's it. But other than that, cut the crap already, will you please? All these gitskis. That's the problem with a world just like Alan Fittleson told me long time ago, that's the one problem with a world too many gitskis, man. That's a crazy gitskis and again we apologize sincerely for the redundancy. Crap. Well, my God, it's better near God than I'm going to get those seven virgins that have been in your God's full of crap and that lake of fire. Oh, geez. Wouldn't be nice if we could find like a plant where we'd get away, that new plant, if we just discovered, there's a place where you all go and get away from these crazy people. You mean the one on the other side of your right? Yeah. The one where they have no, this is a big sign there, they thought they'll get these allowed. Wouldn't that be wonderful, huh? I've heard of Stevenson coming up with two of the staff notice we continue with a revolving dough for mold. This is a kneel Roger. This is five 16, two, three, four. This is the kneel Roger cell. This is your brain. What? What? Any questions? Did you want to look like a woman? That's the dress like a woman. Did you want to look like a woman? That's the dress like a woman. That's the thing. I am burning out of my eye. So Steven is doing it. I'm staring at all the gills. So if I don't go to the house, I don't know what you make the past now. I think it's what I want to do for my son. I think it's not being a preference. I'm not going to look like a woman. That's the dress like a woman. That's the dress like a woman. That's the dress like a woman. Oh, I have an help for Saul. It's all going to be fine. That's a good place for him, by the way. Bowskrain, excellent. It's good and like a rubber glove. And of course, if it's full of a much mid, it will not fit. Two people lied over to the weekend that we might care about one of them anyway. If you want to see something really grow test, you must do it right now. Okay. Although I don't know where you'd find this. If you go on our website, what did we have that was it on Saturday yesterday? About how Lewis and Betty Perdane? I can Google it. Well, no, no, no. I don't want you to Google it. I want you to check the stories on our website and go back to the Betty Perdane one and see the picture. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Wow. Hmm. She'd look like a day over 400. Anyway, aluist-eye grandpa. Grandpa, monster. Frequent guest on the steering show, by the way. By the way, you picking that up for free, yet or what? Her aluist-eye cigar chopping, patriarchy, Patriarch of the monsters whose work is a basketball scout restaurant to a political candidate. Never took his role as grandpa from the TV sitcom. That year, after years of failing health, it was 95. Once the way the Toronto star city was 82, so it's 13 year mistake. Get it right, eh? Lewis with his wife has been sign-passed away Friday night. His wife had a wife, you know, and that was really shocking. Said Bernard White Program Director of WBAAFM with actor hosted a weekly radio program. White may be an announcement on the air during the Saturday slot where Lewis usually appeared. He won't be here today because he's dead. To say that, well, Mrs. Genius can't take risk engaging spirit as a profound understatement, why'd said, Lewis reporting to somewhat cheesy Dracula outfit became a pop culture icon telling the arrestable father and lot of French wins overbumbly. Herman Munster, I thought that was a John Kerry. On the 64-66 TV show, he was also one of the stars and other classic TV comedy, playing officer Leo Schnauser on car 54, where are you? A really, really bad show. Really, really bad. But Lewis' life-office small screen range far beyond his acting addicts. A former val player at Thomas Jefferson High School, he achieved notoriety as a basketball talent scout from a mid-a-to-the coaching great-slag jury turkey, and in-and-read our career. He operated as successful credit-sville address round grandpa's, where he was a regular president chatting with customers posing for pictures and signing autographs. Just a year short of his 90th birthday, a ponytail Lewis ran as the green party candidate against incumbent Governor George Pataki. Lewis campaigned against the racconian drug laws in the death penalty, by going to court in a losing battle to have his name appear on the ballvis, Grandpa Al Lewis. He didn't win, of course, but did manage to collect more than 50-2000 votes. Lewis was born Alexander Meister. Okay. Ready for that? Why not? He was a grandpa, myster. So I'm on the story. What was this supposed to look at? Ready for it, Anne? The picture. Go back to the link. And hopefully the, the place where I got it from is one of the ones where I had the a picture of her? No, I got a picture of her. Ah, Jesus, K Christ. I've seen it in.com. Oh, man. Yeah, I don't want to spoil your lunch. John the baker's bringing you a goodies later. I don't want to spoil your appetite. I have seldom in my life seen anything like that. I don't even know what it is. Lewis is born Alexander Meister in Upset, New York before his family moved to Brooklyn, where the six-month team began a lifelong new love affair with basketball. He later became a volunteer on circus performer, but his career didn't take off until TV to the same. Lewis's office is a shinouzer. Played opposite Fred Gwyn's office, or Mary of Francis Moldoon, in car 54, where are you? A comedy by the Bronx police, pretty safe it aired from 6 to 63. A year later, the dual appeared in the monsters taken up residence at the fictional 1313 mockingbird Lane. And but it's as Lewis rarely slowed down, opening his restaurant hosting is WBA radio program. At one point during the 90s, he was a frequent guest in Howard Stern radio show. Once said in the shock jacked out for the delayed button, by letting it leading in under-avv have seen Chan against the FCC. I like that. Now this is a Betty for Dan F.R.I.E.D.A.N. that I'm sorry. Oh my, it's a man, baby. Yeah, exactly. Every picture of her on the internet. In fact, Al Lewis was a lot of love and they're looking and she was. So again, well, probably. And she was a lot more mature than Al too, I believe. He also popped up in Evermobies. They shoot horses don't they marry to the mob? In 2003, he was hospitalized for an annual class. The complications during surgery led to emergency bypass, and the amputation is right to lead to the blood flow, and all the toes on his left foot. Oh, geez. He spent the next month in a coma. Kind of like Perry coma. A year later, his back offering his recollections of a similar pump and of the DVD Ramones Raw. He survived by his wife. He served the poor grandchildren. And it goes around. And Perry's dead still dead by the way, and who would know the difference. And also over the weekend, by a feminist author, Betty for Dan 85, who finally we found out was a man. The order show is a feminist. Betty for Dan, whose manifesto the feminine mystique became a best lover of the 60s and the late groundwork for the modern feminist movement. That Saturday she on her birthday, she was 85. See that my mother died on his birthday on its birthday and Betty for Dan on its birthday. She was 85. She died at the home as home of a congestive heart failure. Her assertion in her 1960s, but so did the having a husband and babies was not everything. And that women should aspire to a separate identity as individuals. How the unusual of not revolutionary, just after the baby and subverkant boomers of the Eisenhower era, I like hike. The feminine mystique she said was a funny bullet good society told a woman that left him unfulfilled suffering from the problem that's known that the problem that has no name. And seeking a solution in tranquilizers and psychoanialization. A woman's got to be able to say an art field, really, who am I and what do I want to do out of life? Who am I like Admiral Stachtil? She wasn't feel selfish and neurotic if she was goals of her own. Outside of her husband and children, she said, that photo changed women's lives. In racial, political, and sexual conflicts of the 60s and 70s, for that was one of the most commanding voices and recognizable presence in the women's movement. I'm looking at picture, I have a movement of my own, a big gigantic one. Wow. Take a few could that. Wow. That was a nozer of shark fin. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Did we had got the gun air for our, we did got the front? And he he voted. Very good. Nice one may, may Luke, whatever your name was. 754 vote on there. We're going to make a thousand of they during the show. Each are hard out there, little bastard. Just amazing. But talk about ego. How many of those set up calls we get from over there? Well, he's very entertaining. And he's younger when he ever done that old troll from Ohio, you guys got it. Yeah, right. You mama. Poverty QA and hello. Hi. Good morning, sir. Hi. I'm moving warning for you. I don't even think about sending great, great money to go see the family stone. Okay. Nothing. It is awful. Really? It's, we asked, with Diane Keaton, if you like to see her mastectomy scar, then you might want to see it. What's it all about? It's about a family dysfunctional family and changing partners. The two kids, a common woman, eventually changed the ampsa. It's the most, if a dumb thing. And Sarah Cheska-Borkers, it is too much. Oh, that's all I need to know. So how big is that scar? It's not worth it, man. Yeah, about 10,000. It's bad. I've just wanted to warn you about that. Thanks for saving us some money, pal. Thank you. Don't go see it folks. Okay. So, okay. So, maybe we might go out and pick up that video. What's the movie of facing the crowd? Is that it? I go out and I saved the thing that the guy facts over the weekend. The one that's supposed to be like the precursor to network. Okay. Four-runner, the five-runner, right at down. Yeah, a face in the crowd. And I never went out and got it. I didn't go out and get Shinlers list. I'm not going to watch Shinlers list. It's a June movie. All right. Face the crowd. Don't you remember I read you the review, I said it went so long ago. Yeah, yeah. Oh. It says, just like Tim Robbins snied, suited documentary Bob Roberts. Both these pictures have almost as much content for the lemmings in the audience. It's with the manipulative monsters who heard them over the club. But that's guy like that. Because you know how much content we have for the nerds in the audience. How many QAN hello? Yeah, sir. I want to know if anybody else has pissed off of the way they hype up these stupid, Super Bowl commercials. They're no different than any other commercial. Yeah, I don't want to hear. I don't want to hear. I don't want to hear. Their dumbest can be. Yeah. And then they paid $2.5 million to the sponsors. So they're airy, stupid things. Because they hype the people up and they believe in they're going to be watching or in the, it's all a bunch of bull crap. And it's all a bunch of ammo anyway, baby. It's all a lot of stuff. You know, I'm pretty good. I don't know what I would drive like a Mac truck through some of the. I'm fine. I'll find the first school bus in the rear end. No, they take it. All right. Have a good time. Yeah. How would this anger management stuff? And we're getting pissed off. We're going to start to, you know, see a cartoony. They'll like go shoot somebody. Bring a building down. And here are radio show that's boring. You know, go take a big dump in the middle of the street. People are getting really frustrated. Angry. You have a set with the administration. You're upset about their metap in your phone and opening your mail. And we're trying out what bus you're reading and buying and stuff like that. Go pee on there alone there in a White House. Yeah. That's right. That's the picture. God. People are really, and rightfully so because that's what it's all about now is. It's selling the public. A big bullet goods for a pile of. That's it. That's what the world's all about now. Just like this. A raghead business to have it. Oh, the day to show there. Just respect and I, well, you know, something too freaking bad. Get a sense of humor. Lighten up a little bit of a couple of shades anyway. And can cut the crap already. Any excuse to these people can find their right away. Oh, they're riding the burning people down. Because it's pathetic. And every time they do stuff like this, every time it's another bunch of. They all it does is reinforce the image that we're getting. People who have absolutely no respect for human life. Or just crazed crazed and ensamed with his religious crap. And any time I see people getting down on the floor on a carpet and sticking their ass up in the air. It looks awfully to me. I don't know. And rock and back and forth. And they're dobbling in the orthodox Jews. Give it to wall would have big hats and all the schmothas on. It's the middle of July. It's 140 degrees in the desert. And then they gave over there. And they're dobbling and bubble. I thought there. There. Schmack and their schmothas on a wall there. Oh, God. They don't leave the Catholic out with the whips and chains. Oh, that goes with that same. And I know the accutraments to go along with us, right? Blood baby. Oh, man. The body of Christ. Oh, give me. I get out of here. Yeah, you ought to see it now. You already did see that movie. Which one was it with? No, you that's in sleepers. You haven't once said again. Well, it's not sleepers. I haven't watched it again. No, no, I understand. But I'm just saying the deniers in their plays the priest who lies in the witness stand. They get all his buddies off. And they come to church and he's sticking the way for it. Was it Brad Pitt? I forget he was sticking something Brad that's. Yeah, the body of Christ. You know, and like, oh, yeah, the body of Christ, my ass, where there's a will. There's a way out there. They're making on poor Jesus again. If somebody we know would say, okay. The blood of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ. Oh, stop already. When you people stop it. Those ones are way when you've been manipulated. You've been brainwashed and you've been like through all these, oh, my God. All these rituals. Well, these idiotic, Satanic rituals. You've got to get to have something. But devil's got to be in their pantalooies. Man, it's got to be. Nobody's seen. Nobody with a brain does all of this stuff. Just because somebody told him to do it. God, if somebody told you to go in the middle of the junior subtle causeway and take your pants down and do it, I can't even dump in the middle of the road when you do it. Probably probably if God told you to do it or if Jesus told you to do it or certainly if my hammer told people to do it. Man, what a crappy road that would turn into. Good, golly Miss Molly. Well, what is the hope, man? What have I told you for a long time? It's got nothing to do with being cynical or negative or sour anything like that. It's just got to do with being realistic and it's not a very pretty picture, man. The human race is crazy. About 75% of the human race has crazy that a bed bug and the other 25% of the rest of us we have to suffer for it. What home is that? We've been taken hostage. That's right. Just like that great co-text polar in a hero. It was hijacked by Neo Rogers and his audience since far-bison audience there. QAM. The world has fallen over here and pretended we've got this big audience for that very hip and young goofball they got on a year. Most people hate poison by the way. And then of course they also got the adjunct and the toast and etc. Oh, thank you for all the free publicity and promotion here. And let me say again, the cocoa from the cocoa from chronic. The chronic from cocoa beats. Next time you waste your time sitting your face to us we wouldn't even wipe Greg Reads ass with it. How do you like that? Get out of our face, go away. Talk about neurotic. Jesus. One day this kissy kissy kissy kissy then like three days later you were waiting suck in your apiece of crap and how dare you of just just lunatics man. They're everywhere. Thank you. I'll tell you one thing that keeps me going. What? I'm serious because thank you we got at least one stable person in this audience. There you go. Always keep that in mind when you're ready to give out you know, throw in the towel, give up the ghost.

This is Neil Rogers. This is 5-16. On watch solid. It's very king and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers. In 1611, the Bible was translated from a Latin into the King James Bible. And now, well over three centuries later, books on tape presents but King James found Bible. James, recite the book of Genesis. It will be fun. The story of Moses and the burning bush. And the tower of battle. I have it. There's a new testament to Lazarus, praise from the dead. James sings from the book of Matthew. And of course, the book of James. All the most beloved Bible stories as only James could tell them. But the trail by you to sit back and come on a just for a man of course, but raise a wrench. Well, one knows more about judgment day than the godfather of souls. And so James also sings of the famous flames. And so James is the Bible. It's 1118. How is it? It's 1118. How is it? It's 1118. How is it? It's 1118. What's your favorite organization? Outside of the US government. Favorite organization? There's a clue. Oh boy. The pairing war on milk is across unlikely to win many converts. All of us have a idea by the way. How is milk is now for humans? I realize it sounds off for you. It's stupid, but it's not for human beings. Every human being is nobody but me. Nobody but my hair. No. Well, if you got it, do you really have the human beings in nobody but me? Yeah, I think it's just been used probably for more. More TV commercials than any of the primary is human beings. Medley is their smith. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. OK. If there were enough is it cause I like it when many converts on the other hand. On the other hand, the picking new body on women getting drunk and pulling their tops off is more or less guaranteed to hold a momentary attention to least 50% of the planet. Even I might take a quick two could that. Tira? That appears to be the logic behind the latest advertising campaign from people for the ethical government of animals or better known as Tira. The leading US animal rights campaign organization. Lariously produced TV spot. Mimics state publicity for a six-portation video venture called Girls Gone While. Although we're coming out with our own called Getchkees Gone While, which I think really epitomizes what's happening in the world of they much better. Good looking college girls go on spring break and fly for the cameras. But in the Peter version. Tira? The girls have others instead of breast, which will soon start leaking milk. Yeah? So this is the utter version. Got me peaked. Using a slogan, milk gone while the adverts aren't so much shocking. Well this is in the independent UK. So it's as adverts. The adverts aren't so much shocking is laugh out loud ridiculous. It's not clear what link has been made between the exhibition of college girls and we supposed it in equities of milk. So the whole of visit to the milk on while website. In other words, the Peter people are even against milk. I thought I'd say it to you. There against any human interaction with any animal for any reason whatsoever including pets. Even if you like pat your dog and a head that's fan, no pets. I had a dream last night about finding a little mint in sitting down at the side of my bed looks just like tiny. Uh, yeah. What does that mean? I mean I'm going to get it to all. I can't have a dog in that building. How does that mean to you remembering? It's a really bad one. Not at all. No, this was a pleasant dream. I say. Only a visit to milk on while website and viewing a short documentary narrated by the actor Alec Baldwin explains the case against the accompaniment to every kids. Bullet breakfast cereal. Alec Baldwin, uh huh, safe. See? No. I heard a song says. Milk pieces is the pride of an industry gun water which causes a separated from their offspring. Only to be slaughtered for me once they've outlived their productivity. That's what it says. What would they have them that they have you do? Just hang around and look cute. I say milk. We are also told contains pus and animal feces and contrary to received wisdom that says calcium is good for your bones. You might just as easily give you osteoporosis as preventive. Don't be wicked no cow's milk or animals milk. Okay? This is probably not a message that a middle America is ready to hear at least not without creating unfortunate backlash. Nor was it likely to be around TV and any major markets. Peter offered to pay $2.2 million to ABC the air during last night's Super Bowl. But got turned down on the grounds that the ad falls outside the boundaries of good taste. Well, that anybody tastes. Now they're going to have those girls gone wild on there. What are going to make you turn in the stones? I guarantee that. Or can I get a hold of my commercial? I want to see the lead call. Yeah. It says this was admittedly a disingenuous reason. Previously Super Bowl ads have included a dog biting a man in the crotch. A flatulent horse in a number of pitches for erectile dysfunction remedies. By now, crying foul about censorship is part and parcel of penis campaigning platform. Peter. The ad mean while remains freely available for animal relaxes for a computer to watch. Are you ready? Uh-huh. And the verdicts from I film the online movie form currently hosting the clip. It's utterly disgusting. I film. It doesn't have the ad. I got a watch. I have a small eye. Capital F. I film. That's fine. Got it. That's fine. I think that commercial might be a remedy for erectile dysfunction. Do you think so? Peter. I'll let you know. Okay. Guess he's on wild. I'll tell the lips. Okay. We'll take a look and see if it's utterly disgusting or not. Or I'll turn to something that's disgusting. Interpol is issued an urgent global security alert after 23 dangerous individuals. The clearly meant identified as the mastermind of the attack on the US as coal in 2000. Escape from a Yemeni prison. How do you like that? We just can't do nothing right. You know the good guys are all in a bad guys. You think they'd Tony Correction was running that prison. That's her damn sure. That'd be a fact that would be a good place to send a county punishment. Where a fake worse than death. The international crime fighting organization said yesterday at least 13 of the 23 was escape Friday. Where convicted Al-Qaeda terrorists, some of whom were involved in attacks on US and Friendships in 2002. They're doing a however good job over there. In there, where is it? Yemen? Yemen? Oh, Yemen. They're doing a good job. The Yemenis. Al-Qaeda terrorists have been deemed a serious threat to the entire world to be in me by the UN Security Council by Interpol and by a wide range of countries. Interpol Security General, a Secretary General Ron Noble, said the statement. The escape by a 150-yard long tunnel dug by the prisoners and co-consistirators outside. There was escape cannot be considered an internal problem for Yemen alone, as what it said. It's not just an internal problem for them. Among these escape, Israel Javal Ahmed Badaway, considered the mastermind behind attack on US's school October 12, 2000. Badaway was sentenced to death in September 2004 for plotting the attack to suicide bombers blew up under explosive while we know about that. That killed 17 survivors wounded 39 others. The FBI released a statement saying that information about the escape was currently coming into government channels, or closely monitoring the situation, but it would put about. Also among these escapees was Fawlaz Yaha Al-Ravi, one of those responsible for attacking the French tanker Limberg in 2002. The Limberg are guys. And they're like that. They can't even keep them behind bars. See the idea is that first of all, we get rid of these people who are like to kill them right on the spot and then we don't have to worry about them no more. But no. We're too busy tapping your mail and your emails and reading your mail and monitoring your phone calls and checking your, whatever you're doing. Check in your turlet. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. But that war on terror. I know it's hard work, but it's really going well. Hard work. Somebody's going to call Al-Keda. We want to know what to say. There you go. And if somebody calls Al-Gulstine, then we're going to really come and drag your ass away. Good thing I'm not talking to him no more. Probably can't afford a phone anyway now, poor Al. Somebody QAM, hello. Yama. Yama. Yama. Yama. I've been to the top of the area. Oh, I agree. Go again with him. And guess what? That's his last attempt. Trust me. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 6, if he arrives in a cigarette wilder slime. We got only two or three that we deal with like that. But that's, uh, save you the aggravation. Well, what will handle it? We'll save, well, pass along the savings to do all this. All right. There's anything new going on there. Yeah. Come in QAM, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Uh. I got something. Yeah. Hello? Yeah. I got no material. Yeah. Well, that's, uh, that's new. That's new for you. These are good. Good way to start to wait. But they're all, you know, then out of shape. Because they lost a bet on a Super Bowl last night. And did they cover, did they not cover? They covered it. They covered up my home room as Puppered to it. Like a tent. He looked so at just out of it there. And the last Super Bowl went to the game. Like they kept showing him on the sideline. Uh, let's get out of here. That's what he was saying that Mike. You know, I kept covering enough of it as a playbook there. That's what's good on here. And when we get the fruit we're shredding. Yeah, get the fruits and the aburably for my home room. Your old cheese had eaten the feeding again, you know. Uh, uh. 26 past 11 and 5, 60, WQ and who is the fat? Oh, God. The bearers once had, uh, what would Abe was it, Abe Gibran? Fat short Jewish coach. I mean, he waited. He made the beast look like mini moths. And of course the bearers stunk during those days too. It's probably just a coincidence.

The teenagers suspected an a hatchet in Guttahaken, Saudi New England, Gay Bar, and an a killing of a policeman died yesterday after being wounded in a shootout with Arkansas officers. Authority's believe he also killed a female acquaintance he had picked up on grab into West Virginia. Investigators said high school dropout, Jacob D. Robada, 18 of New Bedford Mass, had doubled in Nazism and police in Massachusetts said the attack that injured three men one critically at the Puzzles lounge on Thursday was a hate crime. Wow, I dabbled in autism. Sounds like you're president. I also was committing a hate crime against mankind. A lot of them. After the New Bedford attack, we say, Robada picked up Jennifer Rina Bailey, 33 at her home in Charleston, West Virginia. Apparently she had a prior relationship with his guy and had been corresponding with him. Other than that, we're still in the dark about that. West Virginia State Police Sergeant CJ Ellison said yesterday, on Saturday is Robada and Bailey drove the gas bill gas bill. You ever hear that? I heard an ass bill, but I never heard a gas bill Arkansas. No, wait, wait, the Arkansas officer Jim Sell, I wonder if he's getting to Tom Sells pulled them over in front of the Brass Dermot cell or restaurant for a traffic violation. You know, this is like a Ted Bundy thing, you know, remember that Volkswagen at Beetle, he was driving right? It was a bit. Yeah. And he tried to like to do a little run and run and gun. And they opened up the truck and said he must be a bad guy and he said, but I've been Ted Bundy. Robada killed the 63-year officer Arkansas State Police folks been Bill Sadler said. Robada drove to Norfolk where his car hit several vehicles with wood or police berkade and he opened fire. Police shot him twice in the head. And Bailey was found dead in the car. Twice in the head he was found dead. While said Robada killed her, but Sadler said, the list said the woman said that would be needed to confirm how she died. He was dead. He's dead. And cops dead.

Yeah, I'm sorry I can't even use. I'm sorry I said all those things. I think I got my chronic confused as the other one. That fact I got about ratings and that was definitely from somebody an ultra chronic. I'm sorry who also sends us in in fact as all of them in their case. I'll turn the sucking up or a hostile. Because I recognize that writing man, where it says stop blaming the hurricane. I mean that is so chronic, whoever that is from a Rosen and Rosen by the way of PA. Somebody worse there. Well, find out. Anyway, getting back to the chronic from Croco Beach. lengthy, lengthy fact says to George, Ms. Velrovriga, you know, I'm just sure that we get a few a. I'm from Russell, the chronic in Toka, Ray, a parent confusion by the way. And then we just had the guy called, he says he wants to come to my funeral. It's like old home weekend. I'm a little bit of a number. So he's definitely like a casket peddler. Oh brother. What's this how you apply? Talk about morbid. Okay. Yeah. Why do you just, uh, I'm dying. I'm dying. I'm just like this now when the day is okay. We'll be like two seconds on a year, kill some time. Good morning, George. And interesting, he writes George Jorge with a jade, but a, uh, up above with a G. Well, just in case he's covered his faces. So like some people would say, hey, I think the sea hogs are going to win last night at Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh sea hogs. I'm ready to clarify a couple of things. I didn't hear last Thursday show. And if I'd be ahead time to download her from the archives and listen, apparently sometime during that show near out of fact, from someone the Coco Beach Florida, that wasn't from Coco Beach. It was from Broward. It's where it was from. Considering the recent Harold Radio Wars polls, which has really pissed them off, it didn't piss me off. It just chronic. Several times and Friday, and again this morning is before to the facts is coming from Coco Beach, the chronic in Coco or similar, and declaring he won't accept any more fastest than that. Pretty, do I say that? I don't really ever say that. What do I say that? I just want to advise you one. I'm a lawyer who's listening to it and joined Neo4A over 20 years. Two. I've spoken with you on the phone on several occasions when you were doing the show about energy politics, the environment, other things of mutual interest, and have also sent the show facts as you do in the name. The New York Geothermal Man or George's Geothermal Man or some of you know that? I had my own Geothermal Man. Yeah, I know he's talking about. Three. For last five years, I've sent a show an average of maybe two facts a month from my winter home here in Coco, Florida, invariably with positive content. Ideas for clauses and yields new contract will be easily, quotes from President Eisenhower. Suggestions for polls you're running, signal reception reports, music line of stirraccle trivia, answers to questions the arrays about this part of Florida, etc. In all the factions I jokingly refer to myself as the chronic in Coco, he also said a good chocolate chip cookie recipe that he's not mentioning. Thanks, Pally. For I don't live in Coco Beach, it's 12 miles east here on the Atlantic Ocean in way to a Spencer for me, Hurricane prone to. I live humbly in the woods here in Coco, I've no connection whatsoever with any ever can rich puts who may be facing guys from over there. Five. I did not send you any fxes on any subject over the last few weeks. I certainly didn't send you guys anything last week or ever, and connection with a herald radio wars full, the show's ratings versus the ticket race and the etc. I've had fun contributing to the show for many years, we're likely continuing to do so. So if you will, please let me know off Neil off the year that we've been able to see last week and two late last week from up here was not from me. The chronic in Coco wants to keep fasting and calling in when it makes sense to do so. Please don't let Neil erroneously blacklist or badmouth, maybe because somebody else is negative long distance cow pie. Thanks George, sign Russell S. The chronic in Coco. You are home. You apologize for what you've been saying. Forgive me that woman information. I apologize. Okay. Sorry, Russ. George got all the way through and that's just going to be right about you.

Yes, I saw it. I didn't make a connection of any sort. Seeing that writing a billion times, always from Rosen and Rosen, PA, whoever that works there. And it's in it's not a Coco beat.

He also said he didn't take the 70 law need to be modified and said Gonzalez to end the program Now would afford our enemy dangerous and potential deadly new room throughout relation within our borders And of course the obvious question is how many people they've arrested the I forget how many thousand people would have seen no terrorists None all the big They'll come up with something Now, well, I want to just arrest everybody they're working on it The model president claims he has the authority to order certain surveillance spectators said I am skeptical of that interpretation Committees Democrats who generally consider that bushes acting illegally and for many domestic surveillance by the NSA Sharply grilled Gonzalez senator Patrick Lee here for my nasty author if the authorization brief claims that What also enable a government to open mail in addition to monitoring voices like trying to communications There's all kinds of loud speculation out there about what the president has authorized them will actually do in Gonzalez He decided to answer him I questionally he retorted does this law authorize the opening of first class mail of US citizens yes or no? That's not what's going on Gonzalez said we're only focusing on internal international communications where one part of the conversation is al Qaeda And the other part is al goldstein Gonzalez said the fact that the nations had warned you But the nation is not at war, okay, this is the first answer from yours truly the nation is not at war The so-called war on terrorist just an excuse for fascism become an intangible all your rights and let a bunch of Nazis do whatever it LA want that that's all it is Perpet like that book or a bit on a little booky wrote perpetual war for for for a perpetual peace in this case perpetual war for perpetual fascism In presence I'm gonna let you go.

The integration of whatever this gets you was. So anyway, they just had on the certainly not news network with pure Phillips who's a cartering Nazi. They just had on the court in the Republican and the Durban and the Democrat. They're already analyzing and hearing their still going on. By the way, with Alberto Vioci. And so they showed the move on. Or the great end. Did you see it today yet? The world where comparing Nixon with Bush. No, the illegal wiretaps. And what they had to have the 78. A wiretap by act. No, it's said it went so on. And so the Aztec Durban, the liberal Democrat from Illinois, his thoughts on the move on that, or which is a great ad. And it kind of like more abortion in Nixon's faces back together again. And just rips him an ass rightfully. So, and Dick Durban says, well, you know, the history of it is correct. But I don't know that I would compare a Bush with Nixon that's a. What is this? Yeah, the typical Democrat was man, Dick Durban, Waffling, Waffling, Waffling, Waffling. That's all the Democrats have a lot to do. We got two guys with two people with balls in that party. Ted Kennedy. This is because you've taken mashed potatoes out of his ears. And Howard Dean and actually, yeah, that's it. That's what we got. Half a gentle local we got. Piddle for Christ's sake. Dick Durban on there. Because after 9.11. Yeah, okay. But it beat the Dibub put above. And out of here, you Waffling, you go back. Go back to Springfield, Illinois. Go back to like, well, I'm a decade of Illinois. I don't even know from Illinois. I don't even know from Illinois. Other than Chicago. Do you? No. I'm trying to think of like other cities besides Springfield. I don't even know from, I don't know. I don't know.

Okay, we can't afford to keep your eyes here. You little spit. That's what you said. And they're wives and their children. Right. The guns. They're put up huh. Exactly. The special prosecutor in the CIA, Lee case, alleged that vice president and Cheney's former chief of staff was in Gives in a broader web of deception than was previously known. And repeatedly lied to conceal that he had been a key source reporters about undercover or undercover and operative Valerie Plain. According to court where our records release yesterday says the Washington Post. CM, Stephen Lesterman, so the show for people in IQ larger than their pinky, who don't want to call up and make up stories about restaurants that are closing and about bury my ass upside down and your mama, whatever it is. So I got to play to park by bike, of course. What? Very new face down as opposed to what that other guy said. Back to the records also show that by August 2004, Roy and his investigation, they even park it in Jack Markspot. Not at empty. No, no, I see the Mark though. By August 2004, Roy and his investigation in the disclosure of Plains, I've been the special counsel, Patrick Fitzgerald had concluded that he didn't have much of a case against the scuder living for legally leaking classified information. Instead Fitzgerald was focused on charging Cheney Staphead with purgeary and making false statements and he needed to question reporters to prove it. The court records show that Levy denied a grand jury that they have a mention claim or her CIA job to then White House press secretary, are a fly share? Do you fare or then New York Times report or June of Miller in separate conversations? And we need to them in early June July 2003. The records also suggest that Levy did not disclose the investigators that he first booked in over about claiming June 2003 and that prosecutors learned of the nature of the conversation only when Miller finally testified, late in the fall of 2005. After they threw her ass in jail and she was singing with the parliament, I want to testify. Remember that? No. No, you'd of course I did. All three specific allegations are contained in previously redacted sections of a US court of appeals opinion that were released yesterday and speaking of opinion. The toast master is not supposed to give us opinion. The opinion analyzed Fitzgerald's secret evidence to the term of whether his case warranted ordering report is to testify about the confidential conversations with sources. Fitzgerald revealed none of these specifics when he publicly announced Libby's and Devon October on charges of making false statements per dream of struck the justice. The once sealed portion of the federal court opinion written in February 2005 by US Circuit Judge David Tadel, who is a member of the three judge panel of the Greenwood Fitzgerald, that's a testimony of two reporters, Miller and Time magazine's Vasude Cooper, was crucial to the investigation. Yesterday the same panel concluded that because Libby was indebted now faces public charges, the court and are longer had to keep secret made that it tells of the Greenwood investigations that Tadel analyzed and it goes on and I will be on our way to tomorrow. I believe. Loan it? Yes. Yeah. You are work on it. Here's a poll idea. Look at that. If one group of people were chosen to rule the world, whom would we choose says cliff? By the way, did you see American history, ex? City of God, yes, or Shawshrink? And the listing for weeks. What's going on with you, Cliff? Get rid of it. Get juggie with it. And this got much to happen. I would bust the moves. Buster rhymes. American history ex was on. Bus to the world. Was. Where can history ex come in and email me and call me and scream and go? I was in the middle of it when I caught it. No. I'm glad. City of God, I saw was very good. Not one of the best movies at all time, but very good. Seeing you never thought I'd watched it, didn't you? I did. I did. The one of us did, no. And some people were going to see me. And surprised you did night. Sure, dad. I don't look. The first time I tried to watch it, I wasn't in the mood of why I didn't. At the time I didn't realize it, but sometimes I just found the mood of sitting in the old two and a half hours. I was in some credit. A little Brazilian kid. Maybe I was tired from like, lose my ass of wood by him. Now don't give me wrong. I'm not giving you any credit because the other reason you're watching because I am DB, David, like, eight in something stars. I've given some credit, man. But yeah, who are? You want a little cover again? You know what? You said that you said the other reason I'm going to watch this. I told you that even then. I told you that even then. Made it with all that works. Even though it's not on our watching. We don't have good taste. Now, when listening to who is it for, listen to you, I would never watch network. Okay. One of the greatest movies ever made. I would have never told you that. That's a good point. Shmuck. Now, let's see. Who are the cliffs says who would you choose? This is sad. So let's see. I got an Americanist. We asked you a centimeter crash. Oh, and you never gave you a movie. If you want, even though you didn't watch it, I'm not fairback. Tell you the review. Second hand review. Dirt is life and daughter. Dirt is on. Right. And they both said that it was okay. Not as great as everyone's making it out. Okay. Yeah. How these critics are, whenever there's factory or anything. Oh, yeah. Well, because most of the critics are gay. But more importantly, and lastly, the Princess Diaries chick. And Michelle Williams of, So they also will be reading both show their movies. Yeah. I'm right. There you go. The actor will be answering. You can just edit the movie down. And by the way, there wasn't so much man kissing as there was, I don't know how to say that sex. Man, sex. The kind of sex. What are you trying to say? Spill out. Draw a picture. Correct. Correct. Okay. Let's not go there. Go to say it a picture. I don't want to go there either. Let's see. Rule the world Christians. We had Buddhist, three huggers. Okay. Whatever you say, Clay, if I want to watch American history, should I go get it? Yeah, you know what? That's a natural keeper. There's it. Yes it is. I see. I never want to say you a bad movie so far. If you buy it and you don't like it, I will buy it off of you, including the post. In fact, I think you ought to see the sleepers again, even though because you've got to listen. I know. It comes on cable every periodically. Everyone wants to watch it again. The body of Christ. That whole thing. Just that scene alone. I mean, that has very little to do with the movie. It's a dinner was a priest. And a good guy priest, who lies? I mean, that's pretty unusual. And that priest lies, never heard of such a thing. How many votes we got on the pool? We added, did we add the angry, we didn't add that? Did we angry Muslim? Come on now. See, he's given me crap because of the fact that I finally watched the movie. And he's sitting and said to give me any credit for it. Angry Muslim, he don't have money. Probably had garlic oil in his pocket. He's too busy passing judgment and probably passing gas from that huge lunch. He's a meal russer. He's five sixteen. No, no, no, no, no. Excuse me, but I do believe that's not that. That is a movie. Russer, Mary. Russer, Mary. Tell the truth that they've done you. And the power you voted.
