I think the bad day is quick sniffing glue with the bushes for the White House. That's right. What's what I say? All right. Let's go to some calls Pennsylvania. Hello. Mr. President, is that a cocktail you're making? Oh, absolutely. Listen. This is Bush, this seed drink every night. Um, be really fast. Get on for us. But also, by this point, believe me, we're used to it. Sure, you have a responsibility to the American people to stay focused and sober. Oh, no. You. You, you, you, you, you, too. Texas, hello. Texas, hello. President, is this a course? Is Vice President Cainey at the White House right now, too? Um, so I don't know. Oh, yeah. Anyway, I think I heard that echo. Yeah, I do. There's the echo again. So whatever you've got open, uh, shut it off, please. There we go. I mean, I don't even know why you had that open because, uh, um, I'm being used to watch. There was no cross over because the Humphors on their way to Vegas. Obviously, it was unbeknownst to all of us. I'm being used to all of us and, of course, the bees. Oh, yeah. It was in the before we're doing his Yen to routine about food and slots. Yeah, the food slot, you know. Yeah, I know that. It's called a big fat rectum. And I was just, I was going to bust, uh, Humphors, uh, ass a little bit because, look at this. Now we know why he's going to Vegas right now. The face says World Record with 500, 10 dishes. This is not going to be a big deal. I don't know why because it's really crappy location. I thought he has the Caesar's hook up. No. Yeah, but he has a hook up. But he doesn't stay there. He's been staying for the, as far as I know. The biggest Hilton for years. The one on the side street there. You know, the one that's where you off the beaten path. The story says it's time to raise a glass of bubbly, the maker of Alcassel Sir and acid tablet is set erected for creating the world's largest buffet. And the Humphors on that. That's why he's been very, very together. About 850, 100 customers help bear healthcare LLC, a subsidiary of the German Pharmaceutical, Campa, Chemical firm, bear aeshow bear that the ones that made the poison gas during WW2 to gas all the juice they have. Celebrate to 75th anniversary of his heartburn relief product. No for the jingle, plot, plot phase phase. As if they needed to put that in there. Like most people don't know without Cousel Sirus. By partaking in a massive spread of the Vegas Hilton. In all 500 tendises were sent for the crowd Tuesday. Each one had to be certified distinct by Guinness World Record of Judicator. They range from Angoli and chicken in Sanman, Wellington to Crembroulet and Hummed Apple Pie. I didn't face each one otherwise I might have needed several out for Cousel Sirus in the end the Judicator needing Cousie said, you have to put them in the end, Nadine, because then when you stand up they fall out. Plus they bubble up. There was no previous record for the Snimaki Spani event. So Guinness said to borrow high at 500 dishes to qualify. It's an amount large enough to make it a feat that will stretch people, Cousie said. It's got a stretch. I don't stretch him too much. I don't think there's too much room for expansion there. And I'm saying just like professional sports, not too much room for expansion boys and girls. And also I would tell Hank about this story because he was the just influence Kentucky. Okay. See, I have a lot of family stuff there. For once we had a crossover that might have meant something, but I don't know he just bailed on us. What's more important doing the crossover or heading off to Vegas? Is there any question for that to fail with 500 and some on treats? Oh for me? Right. Florence Kentucky, a 13 year old boy, was charged with threatening President Bush, who was scheduled to travel nearby Cincinnati next week, and two emails sent to the mayor, Paul Lee said. Investigators didn't find anything in search of the boys home to make them thinking he was playing McCarry Offie-led threats. The team was in the custody of his mother at their home yesterday. He faces one felony count of making a terrorist threat and is to appear in Boone County family court within two weeks. Boone County, as that named after Richard Boone or Pat Boone or Debbie Boone, Battle, as you blied up my life. Investigations began after May your day in Whalen received an enormous email threatening Bush Cleared said, a second email was sent also sent to Whalen. Floyd and Whalen refused to release the emails or give details of the threats. Floyd went to the team's home and in that with agents from the FBI and secret service. He said the boys' parents, a concept of the search during which a computer was seized He's extremely well-versed in the history of person in Bush Floyd said in talking with him. He could tell this is a hot button topic with him. Oh, man, just biting my tongue so hard. The blood is dripping down my chin like pepperoni juice. Police said the first email was also sent to the White House to vice president Bigtainy and to the Pentagon. Bush's scheduled to be across the Ohio River Armundin throughout the first pitch and opening day for the Cincinnati Reds. It's baseball season baby. Oh, right. Are we excited about that or what? Not really. Well, excited about it yesterday. It's a day games here. Not so much no more. So, speaking of that, here's the poll from my yesterday. What all time athlete do dislike the most? Hate like poison. Can't stand. OJ Simpson, man. Not even a contest. I mean, just reviled as spies. It's almost, uh, then there's somebody a group is a QAM and probably a few across the street. It's almost unanimous. Oh, man. Yeah. Sorry. Sorry, Oriental. Oh, J.624 out of how many votes altogether we have? Uh, 1861. Or was that like the Civil War? Very good. It's a distance second. 273. It wrapped a few or two bad about that. You're saying even in the ballpark. Oh, he ain't no OJ. No. I mean, he's despised. But he ain't kill anybody that we know of yet. I hate sports 102. Too bad. Terrell Owens, T.O. 89. I hate this poll 89. My Tyson 80. Kobe Bryant 76. Let the rapist category. I'll see. My Tyson, no. He led. Who's it? Can Saco 62 let the compulsive liar category. And the professional slime ball. P. Rose, 56. As in Q 56. John Walker 42. Tonya Harding 38. Kurt Schilling, I'll pray for him 33. Brian Cox 27. As in. Yeah. I can't see any of the words. No, he's not even going there. Not even. Rip bush 26. Deon Sanders 25. Neon Deon. It's tough. Hard out there for a pimple. Tiger was 22. Ron R. Test 22. Kurt Warner 18. It's tough out there for a pimple. No. It was addressed like one. And drive a yellow civil. Bill Romanowski 17. Roger Clem and 17. Mark McWyer, who doesn't want to dwell on the past. He wants to talk about now in the future. 17. Keeshaw and Johnson 13. Everybody in America still wants to know. Do we know any other human being named Keeshawn? If I asked that before, I don't think so. He's no quite deviant. Newell. But then again who is? But Keeshaw unleashed in runaway from home. Where Lewis 10, Ricky Williams 10, Todd or Tuesday 10. Sandy Payton Manning, she's got nine. Michael Irvin 9. Another great credit to the history of view of him. Wayne Gretsky 7 Needle-Lowe's Rafi Palmer O7 who is so admired by Indiana Rosanna Dana. Charles Barkley 6, who spits in little girl's faces in the crowd's basketball game. Phil Nicholson 6. He's a scuttled. Problem substance problem AJ Presinsky 5. Randy Johnson, even with that illegitimate kid he's got four. Layton Hewitt 4. It's wrong with four. Let me burn three. Tie Dome to and Jim Brown had Solomon Teuno. He's got a lot of people out there who are like the fact that Jim Brown beats up his women. Appreciate that. I see the most. Marks who is a toss up. This is for an ace pull. Somebody is already on tomorrow. It's just come on Neil. Oh I see. This is from the eye-dine. Look at the header. See what I'm saying? They changed the name on there. But I can tell by the print. You have to fool us. I had a dime. You can smell it. Yeah, this is all. I'll just like my cure chrome. Did they make that anymore? Oh yeah. Now why didn't we use me cure chrome as kids? It's a different size. It's a different size. It's a different size. It's a different size. It's a different size. It's a different size. It's a different size. Okay. That's a good reason. I mean, plus it's not as dark. It doesn't stain his band. No, it doesn't. If you wait a couple of weeks, it actually will wash off as opposed to eye-dine. Which is the reason. It's like a tattoo man. That's right. You can show off to your friends how I tough you've been. The most much was a toss up. It says between Barbara and Ranchwin at Bush. And kind of sleazy rice. That's cute. That's a good one. Add add culture if we could. And add colder. And how about the band's bush. We can put all three of them on. Yeah, let's do it. Even though this is the eye-dine again. Who would have changed the header because if we would have put eye-dine on it. He knows we have a Schmidt canvas. So here is today's poll. I vote if a janitor we know and she's doing and he's doing grew very well. Almost at the top. Who is the most mature of the mall? And so far we got 4-0-4-20-7-4-07. Like I said. Please, would 90. Jan. We know 88. She's just on princess in the pickup and she'll pass him like he's standing still. When they make that big banded caramel. Jim Manage 83. How do you like that? Right on Jan. Oh, right. Sean Connery only 36. Thank God. So sick and terrible. Oh, pull anything like this. Oh, Sean Connery. That's our real macho guy. I know it's not horrible. It's a crusty old fully accent. I wish you a goofball with a bad bad beard. Sean Connery. And a bad fully accent. Probably worse kills your Sean Connery 36. He rose about 34. Same guy. I voted for Lily England. Look at Lily. She's got about 3rd man. Or just any way 16. Slice the loan 7. That's not what I heard. Especially from those people that saw that Italian stallion. Look. Johnny Weissmellers 6. Arnold Schwarzenegger 5. Kim Babo Camper 5. Brad Pitt 4. See, Annabelle think of him as macho. I think him more like a pretty boy. That'll be like saying mad demon as the most macho because he's in those movies. I don't know where we'd aim and the board identity. Here we have board identity. Listen, good movies. Well, he's a lame macho. And Anthony Hopkins history. How can Anthony Hopkins be below Brad Pitt? I don't know sure why people would like to see that. Okay. It's 12 minutes after 10. Let's take a look at that margin line up. We got today. Look at that. We missed the he hecho of pan riding with the hump for this morning before he so precipitously took off her Vegas. And I'm mad dash. We got Curtis from 2 to 4 this afternoon. That's a good news. He's stuck with that Eric Reed crap between 3 30 and 4 more heat stuff. Oh, that's what everybody cares about. Eric Reed who talks to Rich teeth. And I got 4 to 7 pan third preview of 7 o'clock. It's not looking too good, baby. This is a must win because Montreal and Jersey just keep putting even the least one last night beat the flyers to you to that's got to be a mistake. That's got to be a misprint. Pant of people with 7 a panthers at the penguins 730. And then Jesse Aguero follows the hockey games. Any interest in any of those things other than the mad dog. Not right. Well, we like you Curtis, but you've got stuck with it. Then Eric Reed crap. Oh, he's the real rustic teeth. Hey, Eric. Thanks to Sergeant Fickl and he and he and you. You're a god. Hey guys. If you hate your button guys. Yeah. And that's the mention of these skinny arm. So why should Lindsey low-headed Nicole Richie have all the fuck? What do you mean all this fun? Well, over the years straight women have been glorified for being anorectically skinny. Thanks to that equate. We now have something called Manorectia. And that's right, guys. Now we can be skinny. I'm talking to Molly as skinny. So how do I become Manorectia? Oh, you have to do it to a bunch of cuckoo scarrisons. But what about this pot belly I'm getting from the starvation? Right, one section bitch. It's cool to be skinny. Oh, you can hit this eight-ball or what? Cool. I can see my whole spine. Then, right here. Thank you given the straightest guy with 28k 12-year-old boy. Right, though, 10 17 at 560 WQAM. We're never going to make that 1,000 votes today. I'll guarantee you that because we have a really strong man's poll. Oh, 450 votes. So we know the show. Here we have a shot. There we go. Ricardo Montelbond, somebody says for the poll for the metro poll. He's part of that original question. He was. He has no special choice. Right, Ricardo Montelbond. Here's Ricardo Montelbond. And the Chrysler New Yorker. This luxurious automobile has always delivered the performance you'd expect from in New Yorker. And now Chrysler introduces an onboard micro-processer which even speaks to you just like in New Yorker. Hey, moron, you want to put on your f***ing seatbelt? Would you ready to steering wheel ass? I, yes. This is truly in New Yorker. I change you, Silas, the cop and headlight, sir. Chase, you want to do me? Oh, you don't have to.

Pasta's are rushed to rid of their clearer shelf of it. Excited because this is greater than sliced bread. But what's with this digestible carms crap? You know, I already explained this for crying out loud. That's the whole idea of it. She's going to website and read a boat. The nutritional facts say 42 grams, but they claim only five grand digestible. I want to eat like six boxes a day. Don't want to know. I'm looking like the Humper. Actually, it was just a borschment. But it is not borschment. And the, you know, if you're diabetic, you should take your on your graft to eat and see the impact that has on you because everybody's different. But they have that. That's the whole idea with it. Jesus. Talk about stupid. Man. Right there on our website. There's the whole page. We're all about it. Like what's his name, Johnny used to say for a Philip Morris read all about it. Back in the day where we used to have a cigarette advertising. We used to advertise Fagots on TV. Yeah. I remember turned out the way it did. Call for Philip Morris. I think that's what he's saying. Read all about it or something like that. Maybe I'm confusing Johnny with somebody else. Here is Johnny. What an awful movie. Five, six, seven, all in that movie was on again yesterday with what's your name with the Nicole Kidman. But if we lies, it's the first time I realized that she's a good actress. I like her. She does look like a guy. And she was sitting in the bathtub. A little kid who claimed to be your husband reincarnated, you know, her. And I was sticking to myself. Now I understand why she got married a time cruise. That's what she looks like a guy. Hey, Tommy. You're fairie. Exactly. And by the way, Clarence, all those problems you were talking about this morning. One question. What are you going to do about it? You're fairie. This is coming to ask me now advice. Hey, yeah, this night didn't make your mess. You were straight enough. Someone to QAM hello. Sometimes you see you. Something like that. Somebody to QAM hello. Hey, they're up. Okay. Good question. Yesterday you wrote an article. And he said something about the president said he called the Constitution and GDP to paper. Yes. Is that I've heard that in the past? I didn't really know if that was true. Did he actually say that? Is that affordable? Yes. He absolutely did. That's been in several stories that we've had. Yes. That was a direct quote. I don't understand why that's not like a huge story. I'm saying. Because the media when he's back, hockey don't you understand. That's why he has this, he has this, you know, photo off of the day every single day here on CNN, MSNBC, airways think in day. And that's why. Because you're merken media suck collectively. Or is it sucks? They suck. Either way. Yeah. Perfect. Oh, speaking of now, way to the air, there's to show you once again. You know, if I was you, I'd be out there publish scooping up every box and that beamfield's pasta on you, lose you's out there or ordering it. No, you're ordering it like George did. And the beast said he had some course he said to cow anyway. I have it like at least three times a week. And make a meat sauce, you know, with some nice ground beef. Like I can eat spaghetti every freaking day. Right. And you can't eat like, you know, two ounces is plenty. In fact, when you realize, well, you're scurmer yourself. Right. My problem when I make pasta is I usually make too much. I'm afraid to see the excuses. What I do is a psychological thing. I'm always afraid I'm not going to make enough. Right. They're filling me up, you know, with your eyes. Yeah, that's right. And so I always reach in the box and here's a little bit more. And then I want to make a huge bowl. You could take a bath in it. Okay. All right. But if you make a reasonable amount, two, three ounces. And in fact, you could make a good chili mac. Oh, that's great. But I would not be that. Of course. I'll try to recipe on line there for chili mac. You can get the kidney bean. I mean, really. We don't have beans in it anyway. Oh, that's right. But you can make chili mac like what is shredded cheddar cheese. It's a nice amount of beef that you brown in. Only a little bit. Oh, I'm trying. And then some nice craft parmesan cheese, light. All right. Wait until you hear this, though, grab a hold of the side of your tear. And they once again, the old man had his finger right in the middle of it. I don't want to say where. In the first quarter, this is from where. This is from mediabeastro.com. I never heard of it. In the first quarter of 2006, MSNBC's countdown with Keith Olderman. Beat Paul Zahn on CNN in the 2554 demo. This marks MSNBC's first quarterly prime time victory over CNN in the demographic in almost five years. Well, congratulations. In 2001, MSNBC investigates beat CNN 8 p.m. That was five years ago. Countdown average 164,000 total viewers in the quarter, up 41% from where a Q1 last year. Zahn average 558,000 demo viewers of Q1 MSNBC. Bill O'Reilly average 450,000 in the demo beating the crap out of all of them, but down 24%. It was to go to show it that the right wingers manner. We ought to be on a way to gigantic numbers on issue. Instead of that crap that right wing garbage on the team channel, I would be, you know what? Olderman also beat the obnoxious, the anxious bitch headline news, our Nancy Grayson demographic. Oh, what do they, yeah, sorry. Bitch, see you next time, Nancy. God, do I hate her? I hate her worse than Kira Phillips and so they did your Brian. But she's not affected. Oh, God. Friend. Thank you, friend. Oh, man. As long as a $46 bill, bitch, according to the program, I could get a great 754,000 viewers in the demo graphic. So keep them in view to by 10,000. You go, Keith. What do I tell ya? Always the only guy in MSNBC that able to watch his Keith Olderman. The only guy that tells a little bit of the truth. And you know what, Lou Dobbs is. We got to tell the truth and I'm thinking to myself, what did that start, Lou? I missed that memo. We got to, you see that promo? I'm sure you have. No. Oh, yeah, what is big fat face? I'll puff up screaming about illegal aliens. We got to tell the truth. Yeah, right. You're so full of it, Lou. You're so phony, man. Notkin was one hand and speaking of that, there's Mrs. Limbaugh.

Not this is a new Roger. This is five dozen. You'll come down. Michael you close never learn ranch over the weekend. The workers left. And there was no one to take care of bubbles the gym. So you went nuts. What happened? Bubbles. I don't know. I got a crazy stuff. It was shocking. I was shocked because there was due to a few season on all over the house. The floor was seen on the floor. I lower torso. My butt. My nose. My penis. And my chest. And the stuff. So red. Are you still. It's kind of for stock Michael. The outcome. A tension. It looks like it's going to flinch your pool. Bubbles. Don't feel it. 1032. What is with that pool man? I just I don't know. I've looked all these years. Not only recently I heard people use the word pool. Of course it's one of the words we can say on the air. I said. I said. I had a poor poor that idea. All another Iraq member revealed Colin Powell opposed the board without a second you and resolution. New York Times reported yesterday in a confidential January 2003 member that showed President Bush was determined to invade Iraq even without a second you and resolution like we told you. We'll be telling you yesterday on a hardball. Oh no. The sources that memo British scholar Phillips says still I still believe his brother Tommy stands. In fact, maybe he is Tommy's. He stands. Revealing existence of yet another revealing prewar memo. Sands another memo which records a conversation between Colin Powell and his counterpart in the UK. Jack Straw, which makes you clear that in Colin Powell's eyes if there wasn't enough evidence for a second security council resolution, then there wasn't enough evidence to justify the US going alone. As tiny revolution notes, a May 2003 UK guardian article report. That's my, my dead dog's website. Tiny revolution. A May 2003 UK guardian article report on a transcript of a meeting between Powell and Jack Straw and which the two discussed their doubts that WMDs even existed in Iraq. The paper later agreed to retract force into the story after straw made it clear that no such meeting took place. It seems the guardian was right after all and there's a transcript of it here. So his colon pal was spot on but seems he was overwritten by President others in the administration who were absolutely hidden and taken you as to where he was spot on. Tragedically in a row of his circumstances, it was expected of what the inspector's found. No weapons, no BS, no alcatacnection, all of these things were bogus, totally bogus. And people are dying all the time over 2300 Americans did and a bunch of brits and other innocent schmucks who signed up so they could be sent off to be for your father, for your father, human father, like cattle, lead to slaughter. And what's the public worried about? Well, we got going on America right now. We got a bunch of illegal aliens trying to change the word of illegal to take the ill off illegal. That's what they're trying to do. They're going to take the ILO. And it's in ill padrino. I like that. I like that. I just know. Ah! I like that. I still have no idea who they're seeing. I think they're going to be seen. But if not. I don't see. Somebody called. I'm going to start a story. But we can go. At least. Sweetheart. I'd love to be a known person. I'd love to be a known person. Now, probably there's some people who think that's what's his name. What was Anthony singing in the godfather of the opera singer? But it's also, it's not. I don't think. You know what I mean? Not. It's not. Not made. You know what really bothered me the most? If they said, would it just had me read the dialogue for godfather of three? I could have made it a much better movie. I'll get about what you call filmmaker, but never. Or the casting or the cast. Very well. Forget about that. You know, really bugged me. They kept repreasing lines for me. First of all, fathers at points. And in other words, they made it camp. It was like, there was still like, like, when they're standing in the living room there. And Michael's walking out. And he says, uh, uh, honey says, Michael, now they will fear you. And he turns around and says, maybe they should fear you. And he says it in such a way like it's a comedy. It is. Not the only thing he didn't say was, yeah, which I was coming up later. It was like taking a drink. Who on the other two movies? What are you going to do about it? Yeah. And you mentioned that. And then they're like in the kitchen. I'm trying to think this is just before we had his diabetic stroke and went into a coma. And let's see, it's uh, the answer to not Anthony. What's his name? Gary Garcia, and Garcia. Or Vincent. Vincent is in there. And I think Connie and Michael is in there. Maybe we want other person. Members of the family. And uh, Vincent makes some comment and Michael says, don't ever tell people what you're thinking. Well, they don't even know what they're thinking. Because don't ever tell people outside the family. Which I was after the meeting with Salat. So remember when Sonny opened up a big mouth. That's right. Let's move. Yeah. To bring the girl in soft. Or the comedy you play with that young girl. Exactly. Never tell anybody outside the family. What you're thinking again. Salat. I thought you'd run. Salat. Exactly. Well, any rates in the line was, uh, you know, don't tell anybody about outside the family. What you're thinking because Salat's a was sitting in their virtual Salat. So I'm wondering if they did a drug business. Right. You know, I want to make them all free. I want to know what you're that white powder. Right. But then they said to, uh, he says the Michael says it's too Andy Garcia. Well, it's just in the kitchen. Right. Then you know, don't ever tell anybody what you're thinking. It's just, oh, my god. It's a little. They must have scratched that crap out in about a half an hour. Right. When it does scratch it out. It's really sad too because this is a good anti-attractor message in that movie. That's right. Oh, sorry, Dennis. Not. W2AM, hello. In your garden. Yes, sir, speaking. How about putting that macho bitch? Chastro heric on a ball. Who is it? Capron here? Yeah, she belongs on their donkey face. Okay. Catherine here is put around her bitch. Curl it a bill. Now, I'm going to tell you who else ought to be on there. And you'll laugh because he was gay. But, uh, proven I've even gained my guys can be really much. How about Raymond Burr? In fact, I think. I think I'm sure on this was Sean's pull by the way. Thanks, Sean. You're making a comeback after some very weak material. Uh, I'm pretty sure this was one of his. If I can find out a big pull pile. My god. Yeah, I think that was one of his. Woo. Anyway, I think he had Raymond Burr under and I said, well, we're not going to put him under because he was gay. But he and Charles Nelson Riley, you know. He was no one that was missing pansy. Rip. When you come play that, we're ripped Taylor. Yeah. And that crown. What about JP Morgan? Well, nobody would know who that is. Oh, no. They said I'll go on show crowd. But she was she was bunch of upman. She could have kicked your ass with her. One hand tied behind her back. Man, he was macho. JP Morgan. Who else was on that show? Rip Taylor. Jamie Far. Jamie Far with a big snows. Right. Like Lou Gordon. I don't remember Lou Gordon from Detroit. No, sorry. Lou and Jackie Gordon. Lou Gordon show man. He was great. He had like a TV talk show about a hundred years ago in Detroit. Oh, he was outstanding. A real hell razor. Real ass kicker. He's dead. Don't remember Lou Gordon. No. In fact, when I worked in Sarri Soda in 1973, WSPB, the city of hate. And it was this one woman who used to, oh, hello to you. I took out full I. Yeah, you used to talk to her every now and then, full and then. I do some to fill him. For a guy named F. Gear Parkinson, I used to call him F. Gooseyron the loose. Even then, I had a big mouth and was acting like a jackass. And I liked it. I filled them with them a few times. Form. This is a guy that came down to semi-retirement. Sarah Soda from Pittsburgh. They're there. They put him under to do a talk show from seven to eight or seven to nine at night. And of course, at night time, our signal was about six watts. You know, after on city island, sorry. And he'd go on the air. He comes on the first night and he's like in a panic because nobody's calling him. Where are your calls? He reminded me a little bit of, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Kind of like a pompous ass, you know. F. Gear Parkinson. So he started getting these high blood pressure headaches. At least that was his excuse and calling in sick all the time. So that's where I started doing, like, to fill in the show. F. Gooseyron the loose. F. Gear Parkinson. Yeah. So I'm like, oh, sorry, Mike. And Janet, that's bad. Don't be making fun of no Parkinson's disease. Okay. Some of you, you mean you'd be in pizza chickies. Ready? I did like chickies, though. It just didn't have the traditional crust. It was a very unique kind of crust. You know what kind of crust reminded me of? I give up. You know, Toteinos frozen pizza. We all know that. Yep. And you know how the crust is just, it's just a totally different animal from your like regular pizza crust. And you have to be just in the right mood to eat it. But it's, it's okay. We have 526 votes. It's probably about 11 o'clock. Yeah, we got to try it at that. If Josh courtists puts his mind away and keeps reminding the audience that lean on it. It's going to happen. Don't you worry. You think? Oh yeah. Now that's unusual for you. And by the way, I went to back for you guys this morning. George heard it. Yeah. I heard it. It did a lot of good not. Yeah. It's terrible. I'm doing the best I can. But what's on my going to do? Right. They just ignore me. Oh, Josh and George, we don't care about them. Screw them. You know, this Joe Bellman, I'm going to tell you something. There's a four-letter word that comes to mind when I think of him. In fact, it spelled Bull Schmidt. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.16. What? It's Ethan Lump. It's an ass-wife. Would you give this to him some jam-ifier? I got a theory of this stuff. Jaggle often and only cost me 99. 99. 99. What a deal. For the amplifier in the tours? I also got an anti-stag record block and two HLH out of 20 a quarter of quarter of 3000 speakers just doing all over. Come big. Oh, he 99. I must see some sort of NANDA. I'm going to say, I'm not going to say that. Okay. Hello. Isn't that pathetic? You're how old that thing is. That's from a couple of years ago. That's an old ACN somewhere. And he said the S-Bag word in there. We can't say that. Which is nothing wrong with it. We can't say it. Oh, no, the FCC doesn't care about it. And nobody else care. The audience doesn't care about it. Even the most goodly two shoes, phony, the lonies out there don't care about it. But the joy scares about it. So we can't say it. What a crock of scum. I wonder if she has her own bag, George. You think I wouldn't be surprised probably things like hell. Anyway, 1046 and 560 WQM. This is going to really ridiculous, you know? What? And it Joe Bell had told me that it's how can they expect you to do a show with your hand side behind your microphone? Well, and he was head is somewhere on it. But then he took her right off. Oh, guess what? Mike Lupic or writes in the Daily News. Josh is not going to be too happy with this. Uh-oh. Time for a ceiling to bury bonds. And there's a picture of Barry Barnes with it. It looks like he's either got like an apple in each cheek or somebody stuck a bicycle pump in the back of his neck and blew his head up. Or maybe it was just those roids. Or he's popping a big horse. Well, you're bad. You're brutal. It's what you are. Brutal. Toss was on banana man. Don't start with that kind of lingo on this show. This is a family show. Don't you remember Mr. Family? Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't. Anyway, Barry Barnes. Oh, you know something that thing about I forgot because I had a dump that bit. Uh, mum's er, that's rough at about Greg Reads of Mum's er. Her mum's er is one of my all-time favorite words in any language. Mum's er, just. And when I think of, Oh, don't, don't, don't. Come up with one word that would describe him. Mum's arms would have been perfect. You know what I mean? Yeah, it sounds right. Yeah, mum's er. Very bonds is Bud Seelix Pete Rose writes Mike Lupic. I see like has to go after bonds. Officially making him a suspect in the eyes of his fort before another season begins. The way the late Bart, a Bart you muddy went after Rose who denied and denied and denied and denied his game. The bonds is an idiosive steroids. Here is bonds on May 21, 2001 talking in the San Francisco Chronicle about his increased power on his way to 73-tainted home runs. I've put David in it. There's something that I don't understand right now. The balls I used to line off the wall are lining out of the park. I can't tell you why I called God as Kim. Oh, God had some to do with it. Oh, God! It turns out we don't have to call God. All we have to do is read the book, Game of Shadows. According to the book and two San Francisco Chronicle reporters who clearly never believed the word bond said, there was a reason why he started hitting more home runs than he ever hit in his life. On the same day, the same newspaper asked him about the possibility of breaking Henry Irons record of 755 career home runs someday. Hell no bond said to the Chronicle, I promise you from the bottom of my heart I won't be in the game that long. You believe nothing he says now. At the end of last year, remember bond said he was going to shrub skinnier this season. He showed up as Vigas Ever. Here's bonds on the subject of cheating for more of last year. I don't know what cheating is. I don't believe steroids can help your eye-hand coordination technically hit a baseball. I just don't believe it. In a statement, an opposition to all the evidence presented in the game of shadow is page after page of it, investigative reporters are not just skilled but integrity. The truth is always more trouble for bonds than pictures who won't pitch to them. Here is more of the word according to bonds again in 05 talking about how the legacy of the steroid era and baseball, which he is now the big fat poster boy for. You can't rehash the past. We need to go forward move forward, let it go. He wishes. Sound like Mark McWare now. It won't have to pass. The defense from bonds about bonds that we must let this go is as false as bonds saying he did understand, where his home runs here came from in 2001. As false as bonds allegedly telling your grand jury he never asked where this trainer Greg Anderson was giving him, as false as bonds suggesting he didn't know what cheating is. Before the new season starts before bonds adds to a legend that's grown the way the rest of them. The way the rest of him has. That's a great line. Back home, ceiling must announce once and for all the sports investigation of this home run era and baseball in general. bonds in particular. If bonds doesn't like being called out this way by baseball or being called out by this book, if his union which thought drug testing for years doesn't like it, then let them do it. Nobody is done yet. Stand up and say that Mark, Fainer, Rue, Wada and Lance Williams are the ones lying here. The authors. We need to turn the page, Brian said on March 24th last year, we need to forget about the past let us play the game where entertainers let us entertain. Oh, he's an entertainer all right. He'll be a huge attraction once the season starts to dancing bereth the circus. The chairman San Francisco when he passes baby Ruth and will hear again that is most by two pretty critics hate him. The arrogant Black star for passing the white guy who's been more than famous names in American sports since the 20s. As if bonds is breaking some pattern record by passing Ruth is if we care about that anymore. The great Henry Aaron as much as the soul of his fort as anybody passed Ruth more than 30 years ago. The great Henry Aaron is the one who has victim of racism and never wind the way bonds to the ability to report it from the associated press talking about throwing his super size self off a building. Or she they have enough earth voice out in fiscal already without them. The color of bonds get us in the issue here never has been never will be anybody who suggests that bonds this foil child of a baseball star is victim of racism in self all those before him really worth victims of racism. From Jackie Robinson to Aaron when Aaron was chasing Ruth it's offensive. It's offensive is bonds like a counterability and when he must take his plausible deniability about a home run three after the age of 35 that bears no resemblance to the home curve or run square that came before that. People want to talk about mark mark wire now if McGuire were still playing you think we wouldn't be after him if we knew as much about him and I need is we know about bonds now more than a jug of andro and in his locker rich say you think we wouldn't be after the white guy. There's no bigger story than bonds and forces he changes the biggest record in sports of one of the long to Aaron you wonder what Aaron the greatest living ball player really thinks about this. But he thinks about steroids and human growth hormones about artificial means and artificial ends. And he says that he's a very Aaron who played his remarkable career at six feet and 180 pounds who just kept hitting the ball out of the park with those amazing risks season after season. Henry Aaron who said this to a friend not long ago when the subject of steroids was raised all I ever used was chewing gum he said. Like the chief said and cookers nest gum just remember that juicy food right juicy food you slice son of a good that was just before they both got the. Treatment. Right there little dabble do you. Poor raddle my birthday made and always in for and then he had that pillow fight and came out and losing in. Okay, let's see how that guy wanted like rub it into very bonds because I don't really care about baseball at all just this is Joshua. Wish he already ought to be pissed off at the management there for treating like crap and lying through their teeth to him and that's course you know never trusted on him Josh Josh. 158 votes.

We thought the King Uzbim Hadayah to give up. Christ has onslaught to the figures offering this. In brutal and safe between sight and false real situation. in the season until school administrators learn more about allegations that several team members rated in an exotic dancer in off campus part of the school said yesterday they are accused of raped the rape that they did this these are chicks. Well just the one. Now is that her on there that is a picture on our side. President Richard Broadhead, ooh, decided to spend the team from play until there's a clear resolution of the legal situation of having team members university said the cases royal the campus raised racial tensions and heightened antagonism between the affluent students adduke which cost about 43 grand a year to go to and the city of Durham which has a large population of four peoples about evenly divided between white and black. Isn't that where your self-stiff? I mean, Tristio is from Durham, Rally. Oh, like I said. A woman told police she had another dancer where I had to perform arts 13 at a private party in off campus home. The dancer raised student North Carolina Central University, North Carolina. Told police she was pulled into a bathroom beaten choke and raped it by a three man. No one has been charged yet. Armed with the judge's order, police took DNA samples with the chief swap from 46 to the lacrosse team's 47 players last week. The 47th player, the only black member of the team did not have to provide DNA because the dancers said it were attackers were white. I guess they kind of narrowed it down. I need to have the information about who will be charged so district attorney Mike and knife-ong. I feel pretty confident that a rape occurred did it did. Rod had said team captain Zodafine, I'd like to record Joe Aleva on Tuesday. That players wanted to stay off the field until the DNA results came back from a crime life and a statement the captain predicted that the DNA testing would clear the players if we're all doing. They Toronto Maple Leafs will undergo DNA testing because they want to gain last night they be so well for you. Rod had said it was his decision to expand the suspension in this painful period of uncertainty. This clear to me is a voice in the players that will be inappropriate to resume the normal schedule. But you know that's interesting but NASCAR they had a guide die in time trials on Sunday morning and when they had the race. Am I right about that Josh? You're right about that. They went ahead and had the race. They had a moment of silence. They had a half a second of silence. I right about it. About a quarter of a second of silence. And before they can even like hang their head and me out of that phony thing. They were like okay start your engines. Let's go and kill somebody. All that crap NASCAR garbage. I wonder Joe Castellan.

He kicked John Williams last second. Okay. He's a speed McQueen man. How about you? Yep. What? Now that was really interesting because I like, well, I thought he was done at speed McQueen and then he still was on it like four seconds later. That was good. How about it? How about it? I think he meant maybe a speed McQueen for the candy bar. Did I put baby Ruth? See we've been talking about that and I did not. See Ruth. Tiding in plain sight. Now who the other other than the candy bar wasn't named after him, but there's a some candy bar named after Henry. Oh no. Oh Henry, right? A little really muddy. I like oh Henry. Okay. Okay. But who was it that they had a candy bar named after him? Some athlete. George, I should know it. Yeah, I should. Who wasn't? I don't know. I got my name. I got to do. Huh? You mean besides the old Henry? Oh Henry was an athlete? Was it an named after Henry? I did. Oh Henry was named after Henry Aaron. So I heard. But you're hot. I'm going to tell you, oh Henry was named after Henry here and I will come right down to a kiss you on all four cheeks. I don't have a shot. There is no chance. Was he a baseball player? Yeah. Henry was a baseball player, but oh Henry, why are you talking about it? Henry was an author of five thousand years ago. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm going to Google this. This is ridiculous. So Henry was around when I was very tired. I heard. Yeah. Yeah. It's all these stories on the street. Or why would I make that up? I'm here about Henry here. All right. Yeah. I mean there have been baseball players of candy bars in them. Let's see. Oh Henry biography. Oh no, see this is a Henry. You also got to do a hundred candy bars. Oh, geez. I hate when I do. Okay.

No. I didn't take a bit. But it sure is how I've done it with Hank Aaron. You better start learning your candy bar. Hey, somebody told me to be like, we got 628 votes.

Isn't there a candy bar with like a number? What is the bar? I'm thinking of $100,000 bar. $1,000. What is it? One of those. There was a bar, uh, no one has Reggie after Reggie Jackson. Reggie, that's the bar after Reggie Jackson. But I don't want to put that on. Nobody knows what that is. Right? Right? There was a million dollar bar or something like that. That's what I was just saying. $100,000 bar I think. No. But I could be wrong about $100. Grand. How many of them? Are you opening these candy bar? No, I know that there was a 100 grand bar. I don't know if it's named that. Was it grand? That might have been the name. I know that there was a $100,000 dollar bar. That was a story. You can only eat 100. Kind of like, I would say it's pringles, but it's not pringles. What is it? Is it lays? You can only, you can't only eat one. Is that it? Yeah. It's laid. And that's because they're loaded with chemicals. They make you want to eat like a lot of the way they're wrong. Just like, uh, it was like three months ago. I think one lays potato chip out of a full freshly opened bag. Like a reason for the half of that. That's like they see in a suck. No, they're good. I love them, but I only eat one and I haven't had one since. Well, you know, something that would be like me going and I'm trying to think about a parallel with that. Me going to the store and buying like a half a gallon of nestle is truly eating one teaspoon full and throwing it right down. I just don't see that happening. Well, I hate these add lines that are ridiculous. I don't know one can eat just one. Well, here's one guy that can only eat just one and I haven't had one.

Just like, I thought, oh, you thought you had an nightmare. It wasn't nightmare. The only problem is it's true. I know that. What are they thinking of there, knowing? Well, I guess you know three super balls enough. Spread it around a little bit. I'm telling you who we ought to put on this pool, who also like Raymond Burrow will get any votes. Not because he is. Yeah, quite not. The opposite. But Tom Brady, see he won't get any votes because he's a pretty guy. See, and pretty guy is can't possibly be macho. You'll see. Put him on there. I mean, to me, it got it. It's a one three super balls and quarterback for a maybe that thing. Maybe that's why. What do you mean, maybe that's not why? You've seen he's not macho?

I just got to your saying you won't get any votes. I'm proving a point. I don't need to put a lot of people on there who I already put Jan or Reno and she's damn near him for his play. Yeah. She'll do well. That was my doing. Beans sick and twisted like I am. And Jesus, I'm going to tell you, man, with both her hands tied behind her back. She could kick your ass. You're a T a. Just a little bit of a look. Just a lot of them shaky looks. You peeing your pants and run like hell. Who's the most macho? How are we doing on the vote? Well, 65. Now we're not going to do it.

As Randy Motorwood riff off. Here Randy you're an idiot. That's right. They're in Pittsburgh. All those whiteful here in Passo long. Now, let's see. You send me a facet. This is a little history, but it's all blacked out. I can't write. I was hoping it would get through a bit. Now, what does it say? So the bottom one is is in the factory where they were making the candy bars. There was this little kid or young guy named Tony. Wait, wait, wait. Just have another candy bar before we go on. Bitter honey. Right. There you go. Bitter honey. How to chew and sweet for me? No way. Are you kidding me? You don't like Bitter honey? You have a very good idea. I have my portion. Bitter honey. I haven't had one. They will pull your teeth out. That's true. Almost like Turkish Daffy. Now, what were you saying? There was an accident in the candy place. Right. And this little kid lost his nut. No. There was this young guy named Henry that would flirt with me. He was a story about that guy. Years ago, the guy was he was doing his number on the alien. That was right. Anyway. And he would flirt with the girls that made the candy. And the owner Williamson, whatever, was coming out with a new candy bar and didn't know what to name it. And the girls would, oh, Henry. Yeah. They would get the kid to do favors for them. They would say, oh, Henry. Do that. Oh, Henry. Do that. And he heard them say, I was the news department. Oh, Henry. Very. What? And then Henry drinking other bottle of wine. Right. Why was doing, doing news. Anyway, here's one that says the candy bar. And question is the junk. That's cute. That's a junk. The junk. The junk part only has one nut. Oh, that's cute. That's really. That could be also the time green of a candy bar. How long did that marriage? How many days did that marriage last? How many hours?

I'll say, I can't say much for him. But he's your came through today. Then he took a little project in his hands there. And he went right back there and dragged for a strategy. And they're by the nap of the neck like a little child. Spanked him a couple of times. At a while, Claire, I kicked those bastards into the shape. Because the new sales manager, stiffy junior, he can't do it. He can't even figure out how to speak English yet. He speaks North Carolina. He's. Yeah, this thing with his illegal, you know, immigrant is one thing. See, to me, an immigrant is somebody who comes illegally. Right. We have a quota and the right answer people waiting to come illegally. Or law-biting people who would like to come illegally. That's right. Get it, yeah. There are the four. We don't know. Get him or prove it. Oh, how about Cracker Jack? That's not a candy bar. Your favorite candy is, oh, I just don't candy. Okay. Let's put Cracker Jack. And what's the other stuff that's like Cracker Jack? What do they call that? A fiddle battle. No, fiddle battle. Trust me. And they got crunch and much. Oh, that's what I was thinking. That's all the same. Now, don't they sell crunch and much instead of Cracker Jack at a ballpark at the PV park, Jack? Yes. Yes. See, now why is that? Who ever heard they got the concession? They got the big deal. Yeah, but whoever heard that, going to a ballpark and not being able to get Cracker Jacks, right? Right? In fact, isn't that what's in the song?

That is so sad. 20swood 149. You know, that's a good poll. Oh, that's a good poll. That's a good poll. I just gave myself. What, I mean, I mean, I faint. We're talking about famous people, not yourself, you know, because most of us would like to freeze ourselves at an early age, you know, like 20 or whatever. You know what I'm saying? What's celebrity? What famous person would you like to have frozen that in early or age? You're like, like Brandon the will of you know, like 20 Barbara Eden. Barbara Eden would have been good. Like about 25 I would say. Even though we didn't see her till she was 30, that was eaten. Yeah. That shows you was already like 30. Well, it was nothing wrong with the one she said. She was the one that the bottle that the like the president would have had a bottle problem. Clint Eastwood 149 Janet Reno 127. I don't think she ever looked. I think she was born looking like that.

Like if those two dooked it out. Who do you think would win that? I think Bo Kampers stopped on his ass. Oh yeah. I mean, he's so big. Right? That's a big, he's away from the mad dog being a tough feudalist. But he's not small either. You know, I don't know when he got lost. I'm not sure. He's not a small guy. But Bo Kampers. He's like, he's a house. Paul Runyon. Right? Or Damon Runyon. Kimber Kampers. Seven. Steve McQueen 6. Brad Pitt 5. Anthony Hopkins 4. I think they're thinking about Hannibal Lecter. Aren't they? Mr. Lecter. Mr. Lecter. You know, she was in a movie that I liked. I forgot what that was. Oh, I can't tell you that the other day. I can't tell you what it was. Huh? Chote. Yeah. She was in a movie where she was a good actress. I can't believe that because our narrow-eyed hate her. I really don't hate her if she was in taxi driver. She was good man. I just hate the role she played in Dr. Lecter. That's what it sounds like. Paul Runyon. Paul Runyon. Yes, you just don't like that whole phony through Teency put on there. Hey, Dr. Lecter. I just just... I did crap for saying that. Just, well, I'm sorry, but I thought she was horrible in that movie. He was. Well, there you go. Dody's foster.

Ricardo Montelbaum 3. Katherine Harris got a pair. Boy, what a guy. Steve Reeves has won. See, I told him Tom Brady's got one. And I'm sure he'd die to take a peek. Dale R. and Hart Charlton has been a women for all got the big. Ah, that's a problem. I got to... how could Charlton has to not have any. I don't know. Just because they got a... It's just because they saw a boy for Columbo and with a Spandex Pan. You were just on that with the Spandex Pan. Marshall, guys, don't wear blue Spandex Pan and walk away like a coward from a faddle guy like Michael Moore. It was Michael lobbying around chasing him. I'm Mr. Henson. Mr. Henson Chuck, you know, he's like wild in a way. Like, oh, father me with this. So you've got no answers. You set me up. And I'm a crazy person. You know, I... It's not my gun. I love my piece. I mean, he made such a monkey out of him. He was just pathetic. It was great. It wasn't pathetic. I loved it. Of course, didn't take a lot of talent. He said, I'm a real good. Spandex Pan, how do we really did that when he showed him his NRA card? I'm a lifelong member of the NRA and, oh, good boy. He had it in my hand. Good boy. And that's what they were going to do something. Oh, I was thinking I was going to do something. Tell us about a family whose reality. Mary's a Mrs. Limbaugh. Oh, God. They thought of him rolling around even anywhere near her. He's just, oh, talk about puking, dozing. Good God. Can you even begin to imagine? I... Yeah. And I'm saying it's right near lunchtime. This is the Rush Limbaugh diet. Okay. Just think about that. You want my yeast to run. Come on. Let me tell you, Beach Ford has gone mad because it's madness in March all this month of Beach Ford. Actually, we wanted to say March madness, but it's copyright. So it's a madness in March. They just miss breaking their all-time market in February. So they are breaking in this month. Come and have our high water. And by giving you fantastic deals, too. For example, right now, if you can't afford F-150s as low as 2409 a month, with 995 bucks down plus fees of the pro-quiet of 39 monthlys. Madness in March at Beach Ford means you must be mad. You've got to be crazy. Not to take advantage of deals like these. Re-brates in discounts about to $10,000 on all new and new vehicles. Now, if you are to the market yourself for new carbon-nose somebody who is send them into Beach Ford. Because if your friend or your associate or some strange run in the street corner takes delivery in March and you send them in, Beach Ford will send you 200 bucks. And then money comes from Beach Ford's advertising budget, so they sure is how I'm going to attack it on to your friend's price. The Ole Miss out of this once the Irvine is Beach Ford's madness in March, extended camp for F-150s as low as just 2409 a month. This counts in rebates up to 10 grand and 200 bucks just for referring a friend in cash. So her year as in Beach Ford is 2 miles east of the Golden Glades.

Is the exception the best way to serve once country is the calm today by Doug Thompson. The handwritten note lay in the bottom door of my old roll top desk when I bought for $50 bucks in a junk store and Richmond for junior 39 years ago. He says, here Doug and Amy had read. Thanks for dinner and for listening. The signature was a bold John and the letter had on the note simply said, John B. Connelly that was dated July 14, 1982. I met John Connelly on a TWA flight from Kansas City to Albert Curkey earlier that year. The former Texas governor, the man who took one of the bullets from the assassination of killed president Kennedy, was headed to Santa Fe to buy a house. Where they see here, post. The meeting wasn't an accident. The flight originated in Washington. I sat in the front row of the coach cabin. During a stopping Kansas City, I saw Connelly get on the plane and sit under a first class seat. So I walked off the plane, upgraded to a first class seat right ahead of the governor. I never really wanted to meet the man who was with Kennedy on that day in Dallas in 63, but his communications director for the reelection campaign of congressman Manuel Luhan of New Mexico. I thought he might be one of me how Bob was a tough campaign. When the plane was in the air, I introduced myself said it was work on Luhan's campaign. Connelly's face was up and he invited me to move to the MTC next to him. How was man? Was there anything I could do to help he said? By the time we landed in the Albuquerque, he finally had agreed to do a fundraiser for Luhan, a month later he flew back into New Mexico where Amy and I picked him up for the fundraiser. Afterwards we took him to dinner. Connelly was both gracious and charming and told us many stories about Texas politics. As the evening were on and the multiple forbidden branch waters took to reflect, he started talking about November 22nd, 1963 in Dallas. You know, I was one of the ones who advised Kennedy to stay away from Texas Connelly, said Lyndon Johnson was being a real a-hole about the whole thing in insisted. Aha. Connelly's mood darkened as he talked about Dallas. When the bullet hit him, he said he felt like he'd been kicked in the ribs and couldn't breathe. He spoke kind of the abjacky Kennedy and seemed to be a hit by both her bravery and composure. I had to ask, did he think Lee Harvey Oswald fired the gun to kill Kennedy? Absolutely not, Connelly said, I don't for one second, believe the conclusions of the Warren Commission. So why not speak out? Because I love this country, we need to closure at the time. He said, I will never speak out publicly about what I believe. We took him back to Cache late flight to Texas. He shook my hand, kissed Amy on a cheek and walked up the ramp to the plane. We saw Connelly in his life a couple more times when they came to New Mexico, but he sold his house a few years later as part of a bankruptcy settlement. He died in 1993 and I believe never spoke publicly about how he doubted the findings of the Warren Commission. Connelly's notes, here's another reminder in our democratic Republican or whatever it's left of it. A few things are seldom as they seem. Mike, like him, I never accepted the findings of the Warren Commission that too many illogical conclusions. John Kennedy's death in the Datsets around it to this day marked the beginning of the end of America's idealism. The cynicism grew with the lives of Vietnam and the senseless deaths of too many thousands of young Americans in war that never should have been fought. Datsets about the integrity of those we elect as our leaders best suited days, this company finds itself embroiled in another senseless war based on too many lies. John Connelly felt he served as a company best by concealing his dance about the Warren Commission's white wash, but his silence may have contributed to the growing perception that a relatively large can rewrite history to fit their political agendas, or that agenda. And Connelly's spoken out as a high ranking political figure with dance about the official version of what happened. It might have set a signal at Americans deserve the truth from their government even when that truth hurts. Pretty interesting stuff, huh? Yes, it is. Well, not for the punk though. Who's John Connelly? Who is John Kennedy? Who does that? Huh? And who's Lee Harvey Oswald? He was just another crazed lone gunman, like Sir Hans Sir Ann. 747, I've known him as those. That's how many votes we got. 747. And I think Josh is right. We got an outside shot. If we really put the pedal to the metal baby, 747 votes in Charlottes and has to know that one.

Jet boys voucher pushing governor for to public schools be damned in future GOP nowadays for presents is he Sorry didn't think of bucket your seat belts a bill passed a Florida house with a push from a bush a push from bush That would force high school kids to declare their major field of study now keep in mind that Jeff doesn't mean to like public schools Too many profiles mixing with the rich kids, you know Which have friends he wants to reduce the drop-out rate with this cocky me scheme majors would include English and math or here's the real deal Occasional feels like carpenterian auto repair according to press reports is this exciting why not sports is a major? After all Florida state already provides scholarships for that growing field without requiring a working knowledge of English Perhaps the high schools could have their own car wash and auto repair shops to raise money for other less Rather than underfunded programs such as biology physics and literature other ideas for courses come to mind like surviving while in prison or how about a major in creationism? Here's the best part Jim would oversee districts with poorly performing schools and pay teachers bonuses based on factors like top performance and how many minority or first students They are school head can't you hear Jeff grilling teachers? Why how come so many kids and regular courses where they fail come on how about pushing car repair? You do want a bonus note, sir. Thank you Jeff bush. Thank you no child left behind. Thank you whoever you are what a great idea Pause the moment ask if our country's thrown on the towel on future generations I think we have maybe I'm just not smart enough to figure out why it's a good thing for school to focus on reading a math only And effort is New York Times reported to meet the loopy no child left behind law This is written I already told you at Derby capital times a Madison most constant while bush apologists argue that NCL being no child left behind raises performance levels of four schools experts one if I reduce in the academic menu to meet in potatoes Schools risk giving board teams message that school means repetition and drilling in time says and board students don't learn They drop out on the way to the criminal justice system and these folks lost their minds and factically know they haven't the goal of the neocons is to destroy public education to build the man for vouchers and overall privatization of our primary and secondary schools in our universities L I waste money educating poor performers this money could be used to train kids for real jobs in the new world economy Listen to the neocons read what they're saying they don't like government and they're helping on destroying it Follow the bush logic reduce funding for schools reduced the number of teachers spend less on special education and gifted and talented programs Teach to the math and English tests drop the arts and more and more parents will be begging for vouchers So the kids can attend the Bradley Foundation School of Education and Creationism as for the poor kids Well the Bible says the poor will always be with us because they can learn how to wash cars do layoffs instead of the Bible Hey, we didn't make them poor. They had a choice So don't hold back my kid because the poor may allow these choices please Well now we and Wisconsin can relax because we have the best public schools in the country Okay, I won't Minnesota aren't bad either, but we certainly put Florida South Carolina, Louisiana the shame-dally Not questions for how long the same the Ocon foundations pushing jib bushes nutty idea worked the Wisconsin legislature to greatly expand vouchers in the walkie While burning the public schools the same forces have reduced spending on our university system while spending like drunk and sailors on prisons The same forces keep revenue calves in place We do some equality of our public schools while the condemned teachers because the teachers have health care and pensions The bar variance around the gate, but they're very well dressed We better awake and before the disturb public education by privatizing our system while offering only vocational training to the non-wealthy in our state Good article and right on the heels of that You know the governor that's a fat ass governor that had devious plans the first time right well if and if it first you don't succeed It's a spank here. Wonka bar Yeah, well I know you had a brand of Wonka bar. I've seen the Wonka bar. I'm talking to them. I'm telling you there's some other athlete beside the Reggie bar There was somebody else had a candy bar and I can't think of it as it's gonna be very embarrassing when we get all done You know like the Danny marino bar, so I'm like that. Yeah, maybe it was the Dennis Rodden bar all nuts Wonka bar. Shump with that on there. I never heard of it. Yeah, it's it. It's a thing Okay, why should I go to list for tomorrow man? We kill Eric season. She's gonna plots can probably go on to the US 711 Governor fan asked governor is I would jab bush pushed or what his bush is push to water down the states class size Caps nearly past it's first major hurtling Republican control center yesterday The measures survived in a party line vote, but even while she voted for it Senate education chair Evelyn Lynn voiced quams and they're growing questions whether the 40 members Senate come us or the 24 votes needed to put the proposed constitutional amendment of our umbrella I've had great concern over what the voters really want But I think it's important that we fully vet this issue is very important to our states at Lynn Republican a warm on beach We already had a vote on this and they got to set to you as break so Tommy said with overlamming support from South Florida State voters in 2002 approved an amendment that said a limit of 18 students in grades Cree K through three Twenty two students and grades four through eight and 25 students in high school the strict caps are supposed to be met by 2010 and recent state polls indicate the voters don't want them repeal or weakened But your fat ass governor and legislatures Republican leadership are pushing to soften the caps They have VVS plans saying Florida can't afford a voter classroom treated to meet that mandate They have proposed increasing the K5 five students and law and school districts to comply through code teaching or sign signing two teachers to one class Meaning a high school class that has many of 60 students if two teachers are assigned to it That's way 60 to sweeten the pot for voters before they smoke it a provisions been added mandate to all school districts Fendally 65% of their budget in the classroom although no one is defined exactly what a classroom expense is or what that'll mean to the individual school districts These politicians just can't seem to understand Floridians want smaller class sizes not propaganda and Parvoured tracer Damian Filer a strokeman for the Fent Florida's class size amendment a coalition and includes state teacher union and the Florida AFL CIO while the Florida school boards association supports it for both amendment the Brown and Palm Beach County school boards are opposed The voters approved class size the board supports the voter so funded said burn pickup Crawford lobbyist for Palm Beach County schools Is that like Cindy Crawford pickup Crawford how about Keith Crawford? What was that what was the kid on that awful show? Johnny Crawford on that country west was that show? Sorry some cowboy show Johnny Crawford. He ended the school board opposed to 65% solution because the places restrictions Uncontradutially elected officers and it's smoke and mirrors a Florida speciality smokey just like that bullet train Here comes Georgia slack lobbyist for Brown at school said the county would like to see the class size amendment modified If the legislature doesn't fund it, but sees the 65% version as a violation of home rule To most of the required three fifth super majority vote of each has to get the amendment on a fall ballot the proposals being championed Chamber by the incoming leadership Senate president doesn't make can prove it Republican approaching loosely and the anxious House big redezing aid Marco Rubio Republican to Miami both whom take their on new offices in November Marco Rubio my ass This maintains the spirit and integrity of plan size It doesn't undermine or undo it said pro it who said a district extends into Palm Beach County even should this pass We still would have the most rendered class size law in the land and it goes on, but it would put about it was down to where there's a will There's a way it's a civilizat's and Senator Ron Klein Democrat of Volca a member of the Seminary Education Committee that improved the measure And a five and three vote two the morning the people of Florida said they wanted smaller class sizes except the legislature to fund it and for local school board And get it done. Get it done. Okay, you jackass and one of the best ways to get that done is make sure that the perimituals don't raise as much money as they could with those slots Because that's what they affect as governor legislature want but let's do everything in our power to make sure it fails So we can say see to all yeah, oh my god, it's just you know, it's a catch 22 But a horrible horrible state, you know, it's just really sad.

And she gives birth will be on display in this month at Brooklin's Kaplock Testing Fine Art Gallery. See this might be candly wretched and Britney a little bit. No, really? I saw this statue as the Basin Pictures. Oh. That sculpture is to appear next to a display case filled with anti-abortion materials. It was created by Daniel Edwards who said it never spoke to the 24-year-old Pompster or Met her and fashion their face and figure from photos. I admire her. This is an idealized figure at Woodson to then a phone interview from his home, which is near his studio and Moose up Connecticut, Moose up. Everyone is coming in with anger and venom or is that venom. But I'd deported her as she is depicted herself seductively, suddenly she's a mom, your mama. Spears was married to her former backup dancer, the aushes and grotesque Kevin Feeder line gave birth to their son Sean Preston last year. He's the couple's first child. I wonder if he's kind of Billy Preston. Was there any of that song? Billy Preston and something about the dance in the, what was that? Oh, am I gonna have to look that up? I got it all right here. Billy Preston. You keep me dancing. Nothing from nothing. Nothing from nothing. That's the Billy Preston. Very good. That was it. That's it. That's that. Nothing. That's nothing from nothing. He also had. Yeah, what is that called? Will it go right in circle? Will it go right in circle? Will it go right in circle? That's the one I was thinking about. Will it go right there? It's a one of several different, the singer's publishing is that's uh... Britney Spears. Leslie Sloan Zelnik did the media to respond to requests for comment from the ANP. When song bloggers heard about the exhibit, monument to pro-life the birth of Sean Preston. The gallery said we received about 3,000 emails from around the world in just a week split between anti-avortion and abortion rights opinions. We also got calls from Tokyo, England, France. Some people are upset that Britney's been used for the subject matter to get her own or David testing. Here she is, she's a fashioner ass all over the place and she's being used for a bunch of so-called right-to-life propaganda by the fetus huggers, others who are pro-life thought this was the great into their movement and some pro-choice people have said that this was a pro-life monument, pro-life my ass. All these masses out there that scream about immigration. How come Lou Dobbs is not in the test again in the pulper we've not done CNN huh? All these unwanted babies, all these people procreating and reproducing like rabbits and cockroaches, that's a big big part of the problem in Latin America, baby and I do mean baby, man, all they unwashed and unwanted masses, because they want to please the pope you know? It's your fault, your people, man, your religion, your religion and your people, all those Indians from Mexico. So you're going to the Indians by the way, I don't want to get into it, then we'll get a memo from the new sales manager.

I have the out with the cursus 330 half an hour, even handled. My dog is four who has to follow where it's read. And then the pants are pretty good seven or five. Men followed by the pants are at the penguins from the igloo, the civic arena, the ancient building there in Pittsburgh, where their whole place is falling apart. And the lights keep going out. And that's another must win. It just didn't. You got to win almost every game. I know that sounds ridiculous. But a man in your position can afford to look ridiculous. So it's a big game for your pants. There's any interest. And then just the act of the game. We'll probably be hot and hot. He and so we'll have no audience. Five year old expelled her bringing gun to class. Said, told him about that this morning. Right. You didn't seem to be all that. You were all the way to 22. Yeah, that's right. A kindergarten student in fur crate walking with us. Well, for 10 days after you brought a 22 caliber gun to school officials said, it's kindergarten for crisis. Right. The five year old board time from a chair onto a washer dryer and got an unloaded pistol out of a cupboard at home police said, he showed a friend of gun on the Wittier Elementary School playground and then put it back into a friend's backpack. Police chief John Sheesman said, the boy never made any threat until the principal of Wittier Dunmond. It was expelled immediately said, patty homegun, a spokesman for the Tacoma school system. Police confiscated the piece. School officials were investigating classmates have been reminded not to bring guns into the school. And letter on the incident has been sent to parents of Wittier students home. The boys parents tried to keep the gun out of his reach. It didn't stir ammunition with it. So no criminal charges are likely to pull these chief said, the boy now realizes he shouldn't have brought the pistol to school. He's been said. He just should have shot that little girl next door. There was an understanding that he shouldn't have done it. That what he did was wrong. Wasn't that good? Yeah. It looks good. It's learned and don't take the gun to school.

Rose at other time when at Fluzzi, when I fixed that $100 bills that disappeared like somebody did a, like, crescan was there doing a vanishing act. Ruby. Yeah, I came to Rogers. I like, I was about to know what he asked me for in my experience. Very, uh, green. I was, okay, about to say that. And the first edition. Well, I was the original. That was, that song and also, uh, don't tell me the first one. That was, uh, was that it? No, there was another one they had. Well, uh, was something you're conditioned your condition is in, right? And you picked a fine time to leave me Lucille? Right. But what was the other one? The just, what was the name of that? Look at something about, I mean, I can look it up if I have to. Henry Rose was the first edition. It was on reprise records on Orange Label. Well, you think they'd alphabetize it. Oh, come on, how many could there be for come? I'm going to finish.

That was a top 10 hitman. It was number five, 68. What is that? That you're, oh, Ruben James, that's a good song. By them? Yeah, Kenny Rogers in the first edition. Ruben James, you don't have that. That's a good record, man. No, this is top 40. That must have been like, Parker or something. Well, didn't make it. No, I was 26 in 1969. I could go to the car and get my, Kenny Rogers greatest hits. But this is Kenny Rogers in the first edition, right? No, I got all that sort. Before they brought his name out there, we just the first edition and just dropped in to see what conditioned my condition was in was number five in 1968. I've played that on the way to his a district. All year in luck, I have the CD right here of one. Kenny Rogers greatest hits all of them all the way back to the beginning of time. How about Lucille? I was a Kenny Rogers solo and she believes in me and you decorated my life and don't fall in love with a dreamer. Kenny Rogers with Ken Carns. And what are we doing in love? Donnie West with Kenny Rogers. And we've got tonight with Kenny Rogers and she and the Easton. And I like islands in the stream with Kenny Rogers and her big boots. And what about me?

Anyway, speaking of that, calling the seal hunt bar Barric bombshell actress Pamela Anderson. Oh, they're a couple of Roberts. She might come in ooze on them. Has asked for a meeting. She might have spread some of her diseases here. Has asked for a meeting with Prime Minister Steven Harper following her hosting duties at Sunday's Juno Awards in Halifax. Nova Scotia as a proud Canadian. You knew for all I forgot that she would have tried to forget. Yeah. And so it's most akin to her. DePorter. No thanks. As the proud Canadian, you know, frequently travels abroad. I'm alarmed that people are starting to see Canada as a country more beholding to a pack of greedy hunters and to these skills, a seal skin faction wins of a few countries than to the massive international outcry against the hunt. Anderson of Oklahoma, number of PETA said in the letter, FACES DARPA's Orifice. One of the biggest problems facing the US government is appearing a loof about its own hostile or something rather. And there's something to line this in here. Anderson is from Lady Smith, BC, since she wants to visit Ottawa to meet with Harper on Monday. The seal hunt with third last weekend is a fair attractive plenty of celebrity protesters this year, including former Beagle, Paul McCartney, his wife Heather Mills. Speaking of Donna Mills, Bridget Fardo visit Ottawa earlier this month asking for a meeting with Prime Minister, but was refused singer Morrissey, he said he won't include Canada on any tours until the seal hunt ends. Oh, how can we survive without him? Next thing, you know, it'll be Ann Murray making those comments. Remember him? Yes, I do. Harper has repeatedly defended the seal hunt saying the Canada is the victim of a bit of international propaganda. He says a jackass man, such a space hole. Okay, let's put Ann Murray on the fold. They don't come too much to push you to Ann. Right about there. Wow. And how about Ann Bishop? Oh, how do we get it? Oh, Ann Bishop. Well, God aside, Adam, but who's the most mantra? I mean granted she's a six feet under, but so most of these people, a lot of them. Eight fifty four. See, we get enough of the did module people on there. Oh, yeah. He did minute. Can I admit it that I like some Ann Murray's music? Is that okay? You can admit it. I like some of my great songs. I don't mind it. I can't stole it from Kenny Loggins, but what are you going to do? Yeah. Well, I'm thinking of you. I can name an Ann Murray song. Like this one. They bad. They're all pretty good. This is make a, I don't mind this singing. I just mind her mustache. Yeah, that's true. I have a, yeah, but how about that? How about that old bag into Orleans at Black Chickery? Have you been to my stage member that with an actor Katrina? Oh, that was a little bit of a mustache boy. He never knew he was going to put it on there. Man, she had like a full lip. That was a squirrel that got one. He can keep saying throw him in or live on the end. Oh, brother. That was, this was recently. You ought to be able to own her. Your, your, your quattro says to see it. They are ways of whatever that thing is. George went out there trying to be a young, uh, hipster doing it, uh, new style. Oh, what's old? He's seven votes. Well, we, we better, hurry this thing up. We better get over 900 by the top of the hour. I don't want to push the audience too much, but this is more important than it was. This is like a big ego trip. If we don't get to a thousand by two of clock, people will be, uh, in Tom Jacob, probably write a big comment on a front page of the uh, son Sentinel. He's failing. He's falling. He's slipping.

Whitney won't stay off drugs. It's every single day. It's so long way everyone is scared she's going to OD. And a shocking interview, the mother of six told how the whining, wailing Whitney spends days locked in her bedroom in the house of rubbish. There's the woman of course there are with Kevin Custer in the 90 to hit movie the bodyguard smokes crack, uses sex toys to satisfy herself and birth personal hygiene. When high on grossy imagine she sees demons and is being beaten by the sad truth is that she fights and punches her own body without realizing it. Midians of fans were hard to find a belief that this was once the wholesome girl admired for her stunning work's animation voice. I think it said, Bobby Brown done it. You know, downtown Bobby Brown? Yeah, he didn't need to help the body. The artist who started out in age 11 in a gospel church choir, see there you go and encourage by a family who helps singers like her mother Sissy Houston. First cousin Dion Warwick and Godmother Eurice for a Franklin. Did you know that? I knew about the beyond, they knew that the Eurice for a Franklin. Godmother Eurice for a Franklin. Tragedly drug craves Whitney's because all offers out to get clean she's failed skulls and rehab. Tina 42, say she'll port to the floor and say, see that demon. I'm telling you somebody's messing with Bobby. She always thinks it's something to do with Bobby, but it's her hitting herself. In her paranoia, Whitney made a hole in the bathroom while as she could see was in the house. Sounds like Reg Reed's behavior to me. Tina said he breaks everything mirrors, phones, cabinets, appliances. She would be a Whitney's 13 year old daughter. Bobby Christina was often frightened by her mum's weird behavior. Tina also claimed Whitney was so wasted on drug 15 wet herself and put on a baby's nappy. Oh, these brits are so unhappy. Uh, uh, let's take a little nappy this afternoon. And watch Whitney smoke crack on the way to her. No faith, though. The rehab clinic. Well, listen to me. I want to walk you for you guys. Talk, you know. Tina recalled she'd say, I'm just going to increase. She did. Whitney allegedly called us female viewers to her house and buy eight balls or cranks, eight for the non-tracks. She rocks. Usually, break any ball from the smaller pieces. The Tina said Whitney cuts her up in a cigar, puts it in her eight-ball inside with marijuana and smokes it. Just like in a matter of her, here I was in to Courtney Louder. And she wasn't doing all eight. She was, she's all behind me, it's all. Yeah, she gets the good stuff, though. Ha ha ha ha. That's a little while. Oh, man, the way down town. Whitney was also rushed to a hospital in 2000. That looks such a great scene. You know, the good stuff. Yeah, the hospital in 2003 with blooddressing from her nose and the birds are banded on it. A source sent everyone wonder what happened to Whitney's nose. Witnesses in a vagus hotel described how she had earlier looked completely tripped. Tina had an understand what she's going through. Addiction is a disease. Maybe this interview will save her life. She's probably not. Still, in 42, she only could have over 90 now. Oh, there's a pigeon on my patio. Feel just like Ted Williams with a frozen head. 9.86, man. We got 10 minutes to get 14 votes. That's barely over a minute. What do you got on your thing? 9.87. They're pouring out of the furnace. Well, I said, you know, you need to go. You went out on the limb. What much of a limb, man? Oh, we're coming down to the wall. What do you mean by that? It wasn't much of a limb. Come to come. We always get it, Alison. So we don't. We didn't. Did we have one day we didn't, I think, once. You're forgetting that I didn't get home to like, I don't know, 130 and morning from plunging my lungs. I'm not that bad though, but not another very good night of woodbinder. It was no good machine, man. They're all cracking my sheen. And so I didn't put this on. It like two o'clock in the morning. Everybody's sloughing at that point. So, uh, sloughing and sloughing and fluff in it. 9. Maybe so. I guarantee you by the time we get through from this break, we'll be over the top. This. I'll be delighted to be your Roger. This is that voice, too. This is my 16th, crazy day. You get a lot of things. Alright. Your Roger's are sports all ready. You'll be your A. Yeah. Alright. Alright. Alright. Alright. When I go and know about you, my name. But now I get more needs y'all. Just say, I can't say your name. So yeah. Oh, baby. Ah. There's no child there. Oh, I can't win free like I'm in the air. Your Roger's all about the same. That's lovely. I can't believe that you're so silly. I can't believe that you're so silly. I can't believe that you're so silly.
