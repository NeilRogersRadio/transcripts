I had a spider pull over the weekend. I didn't hear myself that he was especially cranky on Friday. He listened by the way this crossover religiously. He said he was afraid. He can't cut the hand of fact. I've been on a receiving end of some of your barbers' three years. Exactly. He can't relate to the fact that there are people that work together. We have a history. Lots of history. So did Greg we have a history too. He is a history. You know what was going on this morning? They had the salespeople in. I didn't know we had any. Well, they're going to find out whether they do or not. Quickly. The new boss came in here at 8.30 this morning. Yeah. I'm at Woodbine on Saturday morning. We're trying to be amazing. We're trying to find out if I'm going to come back. It's a nice day. Yeah. I ran out of there so fast. I couldn't beat me up to do it. I have my blackberry and I get my emails on there. I'm sitting in my machine and the thing vibrates in my pocket. Which is kind of fun. I look at an email from Joe Bell. He gave me more information than that one email. His home number, who shoest eyes, his every contact number. Just a real nice email. I emailed him back. I got more information from him in that one email that I got from the He's predecessor in eight years. We're having lunch this week. You're not a sushi either. No. You know what? Great. I'm pretty good behind the other day. He said that place is probably going to go out of business with him. Yeah. He said to me that was one of his last comments to me. Maybe we'll get together one day and go for lunch and have sushi. We're in a fast and CBS final enough ignorant men. I guess there must be millions and millions of them to watch those pre and post game shows. That stuff is degenerated to a level. It's just beyond idiocy. All the yucking and slapping on the back and they fake arguing and Bradshaw acting the number that he really is, which is saying a lot. It's pathetic. Did you see Matthew McGoney? Yeah. On with Bradshaw. What was that all about? I don't know. I didn't think that was so bad. Why is that? Anything that Bradshaw's on is going to be for morons. Yeah. I'm not a Bradshaw guy. Oh my god. But anyway. So how about those bucks? How they can't score any points. And like I told you, the redskins aren't really that good. No. But they won. They won based on defense. Based on that one thumb will recovery run back to that. And return. They also have a kick return. That's right. That's a whole game. They didn't have a game much different from the giant softfats. The giant. Oh, bro. They know what? The giant. And the redskins. If you watched their offense, they were like the, they were like out of the same cloth. And either your offense could do a thing. Yeah. The giant's were horrible. That was one of the worst games they may have ever played. Eli Manning man. He's just the pathetic. Rockers. Rockers. The man. I like Rockless Burger. Maybe Eli's. You know, that was a shame though, you know, for smart. They play such a great art. He's Robert Edwards. A second play at a game, which he completes that long bomb and it gets injured on the second play game. And after that, for the next 10 or 15 minutes, I thought there was going to be like blood on the field. I mean, it was the, the, the, the, the officials just like that game get out of control for a while there. Yeah. Because the Steelers went and doubt they always goon it up. That's a team tradition. That's their history. Goon it up. Like the bear is same thing. Dirty team. The bears. Oh, yeah. For years. They're tough. But you know what? The, butkis was a, was a dirty, was a dirty player. Right. It's one time. He spit on guys. Ha ha ha ha. Really? Yeah. How about those patriots? What's not lead them out of the mix? It look easy. Well, that was like a walkover. Yeah. It was a joke. Well, we'll see what happens this week. They go to Denver. I wouldn't be surprised if they want again. See, but let's check does it again. I mean, he could never admit it. But he, he selected his first round opponent. He knew they'd be a, a, a, a passy walkover and they did it. I agree. And now he locked out. Now he gets to play Denver. Not that Denver isn't good. He's got to play the call to Denver in the second game. So just to play Denver. Yeah. Pittsburgh. And you know, Pittsburgh could have said anything. In which case they've be home against Pittsburgh. There you go. And they already beat them once. Yep. So, so I rest my case. Hmm. Never make a lot of people in South Florida. Very angry. Three. Oh, we can't say three. Because that rally will sue us. You know what? They would start saying, Oh, it's all to speed them. Yeah. Right. Three. Did you know that he had the, where did I see that? Oh, yeah. He had the reaction in terms of three P. When he was with the Lakers. And so now that anybody, if USC wanted to use it was not the not going to have to, but they have to pay him a royalty. What a guy. Go try and collect it. Now we know how he can sit down at here. He's got money coming out of every poor in his body. That's true. Yeah. Mostly from Mickey. Hmm. So. I think a lot of people have money from Mickey are coming out that we don't know about. Well, like some of the anti casino people. Oh. Yeah. Some of the people that tried to put the Kabash on the slots. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Between the Bahamas, you know, you know what's going on there when his father was alive. That was definitely the case. I'll never forget when his father went tent took off the letter to the editor. Yeah. Remember the letter to the editor of the herald about the, how damning is evil and it's not good for kids and blah, blah, blah, blah. And this guy's taken thousands of people out every day in the high seas to gamble. Right. 9 billion dollars. He took off the Israel to a high price attack shoulder. Remember that? Yeah. And you know what? He had to be there a certain number of years to be eligible to take all that money. And I think he died like a three months before the deadline. Oh, they kicked him out. Did he die? No. He wasn't kicked out. Are you kidding? The money he gave there. I'll be damned. Probably Ariel's herald made up most of the problems. He was there was a story 60 minutes ran a, ran a feature on that years ago. And, and which they had four, they called them legal tax cheats. And he was one of that hours and was one of them. They went into four stories about guys who had managed to avoid paying taxes by either moving out of the country or some other means. And I think you were the fourth. Yeah. Just a joke. But anyway, Harrison was was very prominent in that piece. And one, and during one of my suspensions, Linda Robertson wrote a column. And in the column, she, she said, how irresponsible I was that I once referred to. Ted Harrison is a tax cheat when he was one of the most general skies in history. I was quoting 60 minutes. But why would the facts get in the way of what's happening? If anybody take nine billion dollars to Israel or the other, they're always not to avoid paying you as taxes. That would make him a tax cheat. Well, it's legal. But yeah, still. That was what the story was. Anyway. Very sad. Yep. But nevertheless, Lars and he pays, unless of course you're Republican these days, that's just starting to catch up with them. But Mickey's been a good owner. Good franchise owner of all the guys who have owned teams in this town. You can't fault Mickey. I'd like to have been a fly in a wall in that meeting with him and Mayor of Tini Pini there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. When he got to go ahead to build that arena. But you know what, he put up the advance money. Now you're going to get it back. But yeah, but the taxpayers, it's just like the taxpayers are going to pay it eventually. Right. But Mickey put it up in the first place. The taxpayers are going to pay for every inferpitivity for that building for the white elephant. I think we need to have that one. I don't think that one's the way. By the way, I don't know that that building's a white elephant. But yeah. The bad deal was made in Brower where the commission was supposed to, you remember, it was going to get money back over the years. Mm-hmm. The chances of them getting a dime out of that place are slim and none. I don't feel so bad about the panties, it tends. Oh, they actually want to game yesterday. Yeah, they're sure. They want to game our role. They'll game at that. Yeah, against the little girls team. I don't feel so bad about their attendance after watching some of these other games. My God, you watch a game when a panties put in New Jersey if there were 1500 people there, that's a lot. Maybe they could have the attendance. There was nobody there. There never is anybody New Jersey. The islanders. I mean, I don't understand how a lot of these franchises keep going. They're not throwing flies. Nobody's showing up. So if the panties are getting like 10, 12, 13,000 for real, again, that's so far the season. That's not that bad. It's been increasing. Somewhat not in the, uh, not in the losing franchise places though. No, no, I'm trying to piss the panties. You know, I'm not pulling up the water. Well, they had that nice hot streak there that, you know, people in that market. They wanted to jump on the bandwagon. In addition to which you had the opponents like Montreal, you had like about 5000 frogs in there for that game. Yeah. It goes in it up. I know I could hear the sound of rivet as I drove. Yeah. Yeah. You hear the sound of them chucking the Pepsi's in there. Well, it was French Canadians man. We got a big election coming up here in a couple of weeks. Two weeks from today of the 23rd day. Uh. If I were heading to bed this week, I'd be here. It's not good for you. Have a good time. Oh, and Tom Jickerson's always watching and other these leaving for California today. Easy really for another. Oh, good. He gumdrop. That means we can look for it. Or we'd know whole bunch of, uh, puck pieces on all the network shows. Are these ways there for? Uh-huh. Lazy guy. Very lazy. She's job. It's not his job. There's job as to write about TV and radio. He doesn't write about TV and radio. Rice puff pieces on network TV shows that that's suck. There's right anything about T local TV or radio. If we once a year. Uh, that's correct. Yeah. Oh, maybe Chris. Well, he had been the guy to write an article about Greg Reed leaving and about the Joe Coming in and about the changes. Wouldn't that have been his territory or nearly a piece of TV radio guy? One would think. Sorry. Yeah. So the only radio coverage for anybody in a market is sports radio. Because if you're not a sports station, there's nobody else writing about radio, including what's a guy to hear? What the hell? Kevin Bastard. He doesn't write that anymore. No. He's a baseball writer. That seems to go with the territory. It's kind of like Mike Mayo in reverse. He used to be a sports guy. Now he's like a newsy guy. A lot of guys did that. A lot of good newsy guys came out of sports. Oh, don't tell me Tony's cigarette. No, I'm talking about writers. Oh, number of a Cambrell Martian. Yes. Monday. He was the sports guy. And the next day he was a news anchor. Yeah. I don't know where he is. And one day Tony's cigarette out for years. He was a silly sports guy. And the next day was a silly news anchor. And just seems to go with the territory. There's a whole list of guys starting with James Reston who were sports writers. And then became news columnists and Sandy Grady with the Philadelphia Daily News and another one. I could just see on his tombstone and might say, Here's James dot dot, Reston. Rest in peace. Oh, just reston. No. That would be cute. You said tombstone. That's what brought me to reston peace. Right. Now you were thinking about pizza probably. Oh, don't start with pizza. Oh, don't. Oh, for me. I didn't even. I didn't even. I didn't even. I didn't even imagine him today. Good. That's good idea. He's really hostile toward everybody lately from what I'm being told. Psychotic. Well, you know, you and I have a long history of hitting each other like poison. And probably we hit mad dog too and everybody else. Oh, we got no. Huh? Not really. No. I just. I just. Just my nature. I can't help myself. Just being. Uh. Well, listen. Have a great day today. Hey, you two. Go up Patriots. Whether it's warming up a little bit here today. Is it really? Yeah. We've had like an Indian fall or something. It's not bad at all here. Yeah. No snow. Wait about waiting to snow. I have to. I have to tell you one quick thing. I dropped somebody off at the Hard Rock Saturday night. I just friend of mine's in the front of town. I had dinner with him and I took him over there. I dropped him off. Shame on you. That place. Like God. Just packed. Tack. Right. You can't get in the place. You can't leave somebody off at the hotel. I mean, I just see you wonder why they were so vehemently putting all those ads on there behind the scenes trying to keep the slots out of the Permutules. Well. That, uh, Gulf Stream thing is moving right along. I'm just wondering how long after the Permutule will start with your own slots. How long before the Indians uh, two people to hold you? Sure. Well, I mean, well, once in at least in Broward anyway, the Hard Rock, they'll be able to put in real slots because this is not talking about just slots. They're going to go for the whole thing. Well, because you know, I know. Fast, be gambling. Yep. Anyway, sorry. I went a minute and a half over. Well, how do you know what's over? I know. I was kind of after when you said, uh, a nice day. And then they take all the time you want. Okay. Take all this out because we're here to entertain. What do you guys? We just heard entertain him and aggravate. He's getting aggravated right now because we're not screaming each other. You bastard. You tub. You, well, whatever you know, but they're doing some contrived hate. I'm listening. There you go.

Lay off the beer. That's my message. Justin. Lay off the booze. I can't wait to hear your liver for lunch. At any rate, in addition, which I got to keep him alive because I already paid him to finish my fence. That's right. Can't get that money back. That's for sure. Well, people I never have to do in things. Just have a spotlight that you give them money up front and then they croak on you. That would be kind of bad like a cut-out. That's not that busy, okay? Anyway, I'm in who called a Liverpool Radio Station to take part in a live phone and show Died Raleigh was on a year. That's something? Oh, my, how are the steering's on this serious? Oh, I did this. Do you have any idea, I mean, all this hype and you got to tip your hat to him even if you can't stand it. You've got to, you know, I mean, he was on everywhere. He was on the gambling channel. He was on nightline over and over again. In fact, I was on the throne this morning. I looked down there. I thought I saw him in a bowl. He's just everywhere. Then I might go away, love him. And then Miguel sends me email yesterday about, oh, that thing with serious and what I like to use his pass word. D'Liston, how are this morning? I'm going to tell you that child needs some serious help. He needs some assistance. I started his therapy this morning. Anyway, go back to this guy that's going to be a good one. I'm going to go back to this guy that's collar. Talk show collar croaks. What a concept. The collar normally is Terry was taking part in the magic 1548 show hosted by Peter Price on Thursday. This is in Liverpool, England. The DJA concerned when the line went dead, abandoned the show and rushed to the man's house in the old swan area to find the Suffered Heart attack. The 60 year old man was a regular collar to Peter Price's show. I'm just glad he died doing something he enjoyed doing. His last words Mr. Price said he died in the middle of a call like a, you know, like the Gardler. Like that. And then it fell in. Yeah. It was awful. When I got there, the ambulance was already outside his house. Apparently he was found and shared with the phone by his side. I was flabbergasted Mr. Price be sane. Terry was a regular collar of the show. And was something was wrong when the line went silent. I just had a gut instinct. Mr. Price appealed to his listeners for help. And one of the car's neighbors, roamed to find him dead in the chair. The ambulance service arrived in the short time. Are you like that? It's worth worth. I'm dying of the hair. Probably with a British man. Think of that. Well, I'll tell you. Everybody out there better watch your health. You better watch it because everybody seems to be croaking these days. Oh, they just decided to put an aerial back into a coma. I'm not making that up. Did you see that? No, I missed it. No, they brought him out of the coma and he asked for like 16 biggles with locks and cream cheese. No, I'm not serious part is they just decided to put him in the car. I'm not serious part is they just decided to put him back into a coma. Where he'll be safe. Where the rest of the world will be safe. Anyway, speaking of dangerous people who are fat. Vice President Cheney hospitalized with shortness of breath. Oh, boy, let's all pray. Vice President Dictini was taken to George Washington Hospital early this morning. Experienced shortness of breath. Cheney spokeswoman Leah Anne McBride said Cheney was rushed to the hospital three o'clock this morning. Vector's filed his EKG unchanged and determining was retaining fluid because of medication was taken for that foot problem that everyone is walking with a cane and he's stumping around. He's out there on a political stump. Cheney was a long history of heart problems and as a pacemaker. Oh, it was traced on a diuretic at the hospital. This squeezing the water out of him like a sponge. Meprides said the vice president was expected to release from hospital a later today. A footile and four cheney used a cane on Friday. He said the foot condition was not related to surgery last September to repair any wisdom behind both knees or his likely history of heart problems. He said four heart attacks quadruple bypass a quadruple bypasses a two artery clearing and geoplasty and a partridge in a peri tree. And also an operation when plant a special pacemaker in his chest in place of a heart which he don't have one. A side effect of some anti-inflammatory medication is fluid retention which can cause swelling and shortness of breath. Maybe he was reading some of his voice steamy lesbian novels. You think? Yeah, that's good for me. Got him all worked up. Maybe that was it. Well, we had a couple lines ringing there for just a second. I thought maybe we were going to head like a couple of cars die on the air force. That would have been good. Got our new general managers and taste your bell. Everybody at WQA and while everybody that thinks they're still going to be around is very optimistic and very excited about that. Got that nice email from Joe with Woodblown on Saturday morning. I think that's what turned by luck around. Do you believe that? No. But sounds good. Got a good day. Yeah, I didn't hear what I was seen or even listened to the cross over with Hank. What? I had 3,000 twice in the same day. Oh, when you start crunching numbers like that. No, I wrote it. I put different machines, mine. I had kind of drift. Two different machines. In fact, the second one was wheel of fortune. Wheel of fortune. Then you kind of hold your breath waiting for the third one to come up and the big jackpot mom. But it was just a red seven for three grand. I'll take it. Thank you. Bye-bye. I knew like that. I'll take it. Walk down there with a little bit of their cash. 1546 votes on the pull from over the weekend, which you're on and on. See, we could add a lot more of this pull. I should have started early on Friday. They could have been a Zidian things on here. But they're on. What is the most boring regular public event? Say that you need in dress 416. Is that coming up pretty soon? Yes. PBS Tleds drive 358. Put a lid on that already. Oh, hello. Why don't watch PBS anyway. Do you? Let's take front line. Come on. One time I got this stuff on CBC right. Oh, I need front line for you. It was watered down back in my presentation. I'm sure you're crying. It says for me street. Watch that. Give me that passionate eye on the CBC any day. Mr. America page of 170. The rose bull parade 158. Probable 141. I'm surprised I got them many votes. I can't believe that many people would watch it. New Year's Eve ball drop 136. Oh, don't you love when the ball drop on New Year's Eve? Or anytime. Yeah. Big Clark loved it. Oscars 107, M. E. 35, and Grammys 25. So they loved the Grammys. And you want to know why? Why? Because there's some musicians under the light. Not necessarily the music. Some people under the light and why. I can't watch it. Right. But as far as the Oscars, it's just a self patting yourself on a bag. All dressed up in those taxi doors and point. All the zoo suits you know. It's just a crap. And enough already. Aren't we great and wasn't this great in the audio idea? Kind of like Howard. By the way, Howard turns on serious this morning. I'm serious. He probably still ran on a rock. That's a fuff. A fuff. A five sixty two eight. Hey, or I'll live her. He had a skin. He got to win. They put one back into the car. His old. But Dr. Tony is a hard man. But now he really knows his hard is old. And that's what we're told. Get your change out of heart that's old. Hope it's gone explode. He makes decisions. He has positions. He has the country under his control. While push is jogging. This thing's your jogging. And that's what happens when your heart is old. And it's full of hope. Yet the chainy's got a heart that's old. And it's done a blow. And it's done a blow. But it's really old. Okay, now if the vice president should croak, I wonder what Pat Robertson's going to say about that. Who's going to be smiting him for? Where do we start? I mean, no, but Pat Robertson being one of those right wing, right, accolades. Maybe the devil, the Satan did it. Speaking of dead people, by the way, two suicide car bombs exploded outside of Rax heavily guarded and tear-manus being bad dead. They killing at least 20, 20, 20 more than 25. And 12 Americans were killed when a U.S. 60 black-hawk helicopter crashed in a wreck early yesterday. I mean, the people there now are like, a wreckies in Americans are like dying in chunks. You know, it doesn't over here, 20, but it over here, it's set them on. Not to mention, it was, of course, we're losing like limbs and eyes and all of these things. All of these things. Like so many weeds or bugs. Yeah. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 in the Verizon and Secular Wireless Line. So I can see it's going to be a real active Monday today. Look at that phone, man. Can't you feel it? Can you almost smell it? I think it's caused Todd Drek was in that studio. People are running. Maybe we can get some spy reports on Stern's first day on series. Do you think any of our software to people have it besides Miguel? It's entirely possible. Although he didn't listen, ironically. That's interesting. He's trying to get needle listening, which I had no interest in hearing it. He doesn't want to hear how it is. He just wants you to, so that you could say something about it. Oh, I see. Well, maybe similar audiences heard her. Maybe he's Howard's brothers out there, once he could visit spy report. You see, with all the publicity going along with it, the fact that he's only got three million subscribers. If every single one of those who subscribe to series, which I have a feeling that all of them are Stern people, but if every single one of them, we're listening to him, is his audience is a fraction of what it used to be. You know, while you're on regular so-called old fashioned terrestrial radio in New York and L.A. in Chicago and Detroit and all the major markets, and all of a sudden it's dependent on people paying, you know, subscribers in 13 or 14 bucks a month, you're done like a fraction of what he used to have. But then again, he's poor and all I'm going to do is pocket and so is a down buck wall, and they're having a good time with it. WDQAM, hello. QAM. Me, oh. Yes. I haven't had a chance to listen like all last week, but I'm sure that you've already touched on it. About badass bush, governor bush going to force that still through to get public money to the private school. Yeah. Did you guys already touched on that? Yeah, we touched on it, yeah. Old news. Yeah. I love your show man. Thanks for the old news. I'm five six seven oh five sixty-bought tell you man, oh man, oh man, I'm going to kiss the ground. I'm kissing the counter right now. I'm kissing it. Look out, oh mighty. Just being out of that place. It's just it's a scary. It's really a scary thing. Already, every day. Holy cow, that that town needs a gigantic blueberry animal. Make no mistake about it. And even that wouldn't help. Remember that fast dollar song or a thumb I'd feel? Yeah, I remember. With that long blueberry tube. Somebody QAM hello. Yeah, hold on, you'll turn your off. There you go. Yes. How are you doing? That was quite a project, yeah. But for sure. That's not right. Sire's on it. Yeah. And first off I wanted to sew the bird eyes. I forgot to grab fantastic. Okay. I rubbed it, but I still use my hand. I don't use the washcloth. I've heard of your life. Whatever does it for you. I don't know. It's second off. What a shame about the training I'm crying as we speak. I'm not going to say that. He's back out. I don't worry about him. He's back out when you're in the middle of it. Even when hateful is him. They don't keep you in there too long. Well, I think you know, I start to wonder. Maybe they just wanted to give them some sympathy. Yeah. Get deeper, feelin' sympathetic. Good evening. Right along. Yeah, moving right along. I wanted to know. What's the guy in this reality, chick? Moishi Puppin. Tiny Manush. A.B. Ishkebibble. W.K.Y.M. Hello. Hey, Neil. How are you? Pretty good. What's the guy in this reality? Oh. And I'm wondering about those. Everyone else shows. I'm wondering about those NFL pregame shows. Q.Y.M. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I was flipping through the channel the other day. And I stumbled on this kind of thing. Or honor Robert Redford. And there was the funniest thing because they were showing clips from all the presidents men and list for Brokehog. You know, the MC is saying how for whether for this movie. And they're from maybe the president. We would never know about wannabe and the whole time the camera cuts the bush in his wife. And they were so uncomfortable. They're looking around. He's looking at the floor. And it's just the most guilty look. It was like he couldn't wait for that segment to get off of his hilarious. Yeah, but Lisa's got Bob Wood. We're there to be here. We're going to have a minute to the White House photographer. A real chill Bob Woodward. How he turned. You know, a little bit of fame. That's what it does to people. Also makes them very pedantic. So they talk about people like Senator Kennedy in a very strange and pedantic way. And you want to do real people really speak like that. Bob. I don't think so. Do they? I wonder if he has his ball movements. There are his pedantic as his speech. Does anybody hear what he am? Hello. Yeah, I'm a little bit scared. Hello. But Neil, how are you? Okay. Good. Maybe fix up it. I'll last year. The, the, the, the, however stock doubled in price. Do you know how much did Jamie maybe last year? Even though his stock is supposed to be in $1 trillion. No, no, he made $88 million last year. Yeah. And you're, and you're not supposed to profit off of young Americans. That's, sorry. Yeah, well, he's doing it. Unbelievable. Is that's why he had to get on the hospital record this morning. He's, he's been trying to stack the Supreme Court. If you know that he is the, if he passed the law, I think I want to walk past the very first six months, as he was in office, that, you know, most of the president's records become public record after 20 years. Everybody in the, say good baby, I'm already known that that's not why he's stuck in a court. But nevertheless, I'm everything this is there. You know, all right, is this what it's going to be all day today? Because I'm going to go back to Vegas. I'm going to go back to Vegas. I'm going to go back to Vegas. I'm going to go back to Vegas. I'm going to go back to Vegas. I'm going to go back to Vegas. I'm going to go back to Vegas. All right. Is this what it's going to be all day today? Because I'm going to go back to bed. I'll be people are so morbid and so one dimensional, man. It's all day one, you know. Hey. Can we see? There's no way. Yeah. I didn't go like that. I didn't vote for him either time. Did any of you? I'm sure a lot of you did. And now. What are we going to do? Go out and demonstrate in the streets. Okay. Go to something useful. Go on. They love somebody's roof for something. Well, I'll tell you. I don't have to tell you. In South Florida right now, trying to find anybody to repair a roof, a pool, a fancier, and anything. It's almost impossible. In fact, most people leave retur your phone calls because they got so much work now. People who ordinarily would be like, you know, kissing your feet. Kissing both cheeks. Now, they don't even have time for it because it's, so that's what we have. We better than well not have no serious hurried kids this year. I'll tell you that. Because it's going to take people a long, long time to put the pieces of the puzzle back together. And nobody talks too much about that. It's always here about his new Orleans and Katrina. Well, guess what? People listen to me right now. They don't live in New Orleans and they don't give a flying crowd. Or some of them did have some Katrina damage. But it was Wilma, baby. Wilma. Right. That was the bad. The sick pill was Wilma. And people are trying to put their loves together. We're going to meet these people. Yeah. You know what? What are we going to do about it? Okay. We're going to win. Peach him. I don't see anybody. I would say serious impeachment proceedings going on right now. And that's because you've got a Spimus Democratic Party. They're still well. We're going to go after that Toledo man. Okay. Good luck to you. Spimus Jellyfish. Waffled on the war just like Schumer on their Chuck Schumer. He's on the East. He's another one. Waffled on the war. Daily. If I can Democrats out of open up 8,000 branches of the waffle house. We're some serious campaign money. Because that's what they do best is waffle. Just like they're candidate last time. One of the great waffers of all time. Five six seven. Five sixty boy. Seriously. If we have to hear about Bush and Cheney all day to the end. And fat ass bush. We already know those things. It's called restating the obvious man. I'm not even reading these damn articles here. I got some damn good articles. Pakistan Saudi Arabia 9. 11. How much did the Bush administration know? All of it. The death of freedom. The rights of ordinary people to speak out against an unjust war in the cross. These unleashed in their name are being crushed. Fascism is at the door. Who else will fight it? How do you like that? Gambleing votes at sale for my. I might just shmit all these damn stories. And favor of some of these big calls and favor of a whole bunch of these calls. Oh my god. And who just sent this to me? It's all the same stuff. It's all the same stuff. Call off Randy. Okay. Turn on. Scaram America. You people are driving me nuts. They want us to go back to the same old. I'm not doing it man. After all these years again away from that crap. It's the right against the left. It's more a perfect against Connie Chink. It's a good thing. But we've been putting it up. No wonder we caused these on here. It's two people's fault. Not permission that crap on the NFL. If I have to see James Brown and his band of renown and stick in Terry Bradshaw, a dozen sawdust and another bunch of silly, how he long. Oh god. Just, you know, and why did I watch it? That's a good question because I never watched that stuff. I watched it because the game I had no idea what the time the game was starting. And it was a mouse on at the time. Yeah. I mean, give me a break. How could there be millions of men? All men of course watching that crap. Stupid enough to watch that garbage because it appeals to, it appeals to an intellect. So I like to go to call the first car. What's that guy that's chicken is real? Moishi, that's a guy he's name. Okay. Macy, typically. Honey, spendrick. Yeah, right. See even go in like George Noah all the due names. Honey, spendrick, I like him a lot. Sam Shmagegi. He's another one of my favorites. Yeah, that's my dentist. Yeah. Oh, yours too, huh? Look for the QM van right now to shell station in North West 253-87 with Avenue in Derral. Stop by and pick up movie passes to lock the premiere of Glory Holds. A Glory Road to Martha Dolphin Mall. And the Vandal Beaver until the passes run out. This is the real run. This is 516A. It's how it's been. It's how it's been. He put the wine in his soda. Can't give it to the kids. He put the wine in the soda. Can't have kept it boys from the wine in the soda. Can't give it to some of you. He put the wine in the soda. Can't have got the Jesus through. He put the wine in the soda. Can't have never ran. He put the wine in the soda. Can't have been. I'm drinking it up. Wow. It's a soda, can't. It's wine. I just can't. Sam 47. He's still running around over there. And the words you know somewhere in one of them. Arab countries with all of them. Right his. Yeah. Melissa and little Arab kids with a life. So over there. Cause most of the populations under 10. Here's the facts from Kim. It's very depressing. Why? This really catches me off guard. Right after I made peace with your close friend. Tom director. How did you know how diplomatically I did that? That was fine. Yeah. If I ever want. I thought I would get rid of him. And he. And that's like any of these people. Send me your buddy Troy there. You say yes. Okay. Whatever you want. Just go away. And if I'm. And it won't stop. Use sales holes. If you spend as much time selling as you do belly aching. That's a soda soda. Florida. And our sales department. And the dolphins. How do the dolphin playoff games are coming? I missed those over the weekend. Do I see any scores? Oh yeah. Good stuff. I think they missed it too. Wow. Too bad. They're just like Hank give me that song and then set the redskins one five and road. That's why they were going to win. Which they did win. But boy. Any team that's got Mark Brunella quarterback. I would raise four eyebrows on that. I say, oh, I wouldn't get the two said about their offense. Anyway, Kim writes. She says, I have serious. So I can listen to how or he covers the time before you come on. I love with two wonder lines. I love the serious radio. She loves it. She loves it. It's worth every penny. You should be on it. Please. It says. Please. I got a choice. No. I came also reiterating another idiot of points that she made once before. It all came. I'm sure you're really a sweetheart. But your eyesight is really bad. Give her my ophthalmologist phone number and Tamarack. I got a really good eye guy. Dr. Moorshee Puppek. That's the one. No, Dr. Ben Dover. Man. Dr. Buster Heiman. Roth. TS Gus is hot. He's talking about I got you. He's not getting any better. He did. Oh, you can be sure he's not dead. And they already said the body wasn't him. But Gus is about his hot. It's 14,000 ice cubes. All jumb deep in jam deep in your throat. Give me a break him. Oh, man. This is what. This is why you really ugly guys out there that's good news for you. You got a shot. Because there are millions of women with really bad taste. Here's a facts from Steve O. Steve says on here. Look at this. The facts are pouring in. Donn and for Lauderdale. But first Steve says whoever told you that you've listened to Howard online by using his past where it was wrong. You can't listen to Howard on serious vibe. The internet is show is only available on the radio. Wow. Excuse me. For your me more bad information out that I want to hear it anyway. Also, one for the pool. The jury Lewis Telephone. They didn't have it on. They don't talk about stretching. See, I did this wrong. We should have started this pool on Friday. Whatever. Yeah. There's no wrong way. Jerry Lewis Telephone. Have a great day. You see. There's a little smiley face. Which he's probably looking right now. Have a great day, Steve. Somebody would have a smile on their faces opposed to all these. You know, a hell of a way to start on the Monday morning. Well, Bush did this and changed that and it's old news. But didn't hear that. Your fat ass governor is trying to, I'll circumvent the Supreme Court. Yeah, we know. Anyway. Here's the more depressing news. Donn and for Lauderdale. This adds out of the spy report that I'd heard over the weekend. I'm Friday. I'm always on his worst rant. I ever heard directed to you. But mostly toward Hank who is your pet bitch. According to Moe, you two just kiss up to each other and Fridays cross over. I'm listening. Really got his go to Muscrat. That little drop and you keep playing. Which one? I'm listening. I'm listening. That one. No, that's not the one. All the right. That's another. After he got done putting you two down, he went on to poop. The trip to station spossing to the Bahamas to play golf with Hank. I didn't even know we were sponsoring a trip to the Bahamas to play golf with the Humper. Did you? I didn't know. Josh, do you know about that? I did not. No. First he said Hank needs to take a lot of balls because he'll keep hitting him into the water. Then he met a fun of Hank's wardrobe and physique and said how silly he'll look out there and Nicker's checkered pants. It is so obvious the level of jealousy is in all time, I'm sure it doesn't help the station choose to vote. A fun golfing trip with Hank, rather than off of one with Moe, since he considers himself the golfing authority. A trip with Moe, talk about stales, his Donna and four lot of stuff. Your stale moe, your stale. So is that peeper by the way, it's really stale. Oh, for me. But he was always kind of a crusty guy anyway, wasn't he? Must be in crusty. These calls continue to be so depressing. No, seriously, I'm sure that one of our colors is going to cloak right in the middle of a call on the ear. I can't wait. Got any ideas for who? Oh, I got several in my list. Yeah. Well, there's one at the top of my list who usually says, That's the one. Wouldn't that be wonderful. Come any QAM, hello. B. What was that? A mating call, I think. No, what was that? He said, he gave. I think he said, gay. No, but he did. Like about two letters though, we couldn't get all three letters out. Maybe don't know the whole announcement back yet. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Come on, let's hear a lot of belly aching. What do you like today? It's belly aching Monday. I can just feel it already. I'd be much more concerned about putting my house back together again in my pool and my fence and my roof and my life and my flooring and all of that stuff, which most people in South Florida right now have an eight bitch of a time. Speaking of bitch. WQAM, hello. Hi, I'm your name. That's to that. That's bad news. WQAM, hello. It was from him or Dick Cheney, both would have been bad news. QAM. Goi. Goi. WQAM. Hello. You're gay. WQAM. Hello. Hello, Neil. You're there. Hey, Neil, that's much of our gay period to run. That's not the right thing to say, man. He must be a real asshole. There's a real good bulletin for you there, right? Yeah. Now, there's one of the people watching the NFL today. Guarantee on that. Oh, yeah. He probably would like to be Terry Bradshaw's bitch. Or has that? It could be. WQAM, hello. Yeah, I'd like to complain as a dolphins right on this weekend. Yeah. Then they won't be on this weekend. How are you doing Neil? How are you doing? I'm not doing it, pal. Oh, God. He's still making sick. I just want to go out the road. Go ahead. Tell him to give you our permission. WQAM, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, what's going on then? Not too much. You know, did you happen to catch Michael Mayo's paper or, well, yes, sir. Something like that. You're not missing. I think it's not a particular look at it. I have no idea. I always question. I've got a lot of about our fabulous voting machines. You know, I always bring that to the end also. But, you know, basically, just real quickly, you know, you have me fishing in my hues and heth. I might not have given you the revenge for that. And I think I lost my trades, but be well-fired. Okay, Bobby Gazunt as the Chinese say. I think I know what that means. He's be well. Well, I listen since you talked about, you know, I'm in Roth and all these other, you lost. What's that guy in Israel? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I think his name is Sharon. I'm a press to guy named Sharon. It's basically winning, which she weighs 600 pounds. 1621 votes on the pool. I think I'm going to have to start there the new pool. I could about 11. Maybe 11 and about 10 million. Because this one is from over the weekend. It's kind of stale if I dare use that word. It's stale. And by the way, happy Monday, Mo. What have we got today? We got Mo with two maddog at 4-3 solid hours. That goes, we got no panter game tonight. They want to game in the shoot out yesterday. They be Washington at 4-3 a. Well, and they're all out to be the girls team. They're all out to be the girls team. They're all out to be the girls team.

From most of the calls on top show is 567.560. 565. 565. And the Verizon singular wireless lines. Get it off your chest today, man. Get out of your system because obviously, Sound Floor has got a lot of mint and tissue. Like that. And they do. What a day before Monday, no less. Dominic, you weigh him, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. It's a ironic. You play that big by the e-cupritics. That's about the time. It's so dilucing in the night. Listen, Malbo, we have been told 1995. We're going to move and I can't back in 2004. And then I get permission for a lot. I'd get things reorganized and then they left and on a young. Downers and then. Oh, God. Ah. Just what you think you get when you get one of reach one retard. And then all of a sudden it comes back in. There's a second call since returning with his young. Get some military. Okay, when you go away for 10 years next time. What a day. Oh, my God. Now, there's a guy that we would hope would croak on a year. You're in my ass. How do you do that? 560560 pound five 60 knee Verizon and singular wireless lines. Man, oh man, what a vast wasteland. Just pathetic. WQA in. Hello. Not there. QAM. Hello. QAM. WQA in. Hello. I'll be your big. And our last one. WQA in. I can't. Okay, that's it. Okay, good material. We're not building this pool. So as a result, they have no material. Nothing to say except. Well, Bush is bad and changed only croak and your fat ass governor. Yeah. Good. Like I said, Colophe, Skir America. And there's an interesting possibility here. Okay, we've been on for a little more than an hour. And remember what I asked about spyreports on Stern and his first day on series today. After the 80 trillion dollars worth of free publicity. He generated right. We have an everyone call about that. Good. Let me, they're still listening. I bet you're part of maybe they're still listening. Yeah, maybe he's still on there. Right. It's only 11 or four. Maybe he's going to go on to like one o'clock in the morning. Maybe those people just took their terrestrial radio out and threw them in a canal. That seems very likely to be or maybe since his only three million subscribers to series. And a country of 300 million people. Maybe they just aren't that many people out there hearing it. Except, you know, who and even he's not listening. He's got it. He's got it. He ain't listening for free. No less than he wasn't listening. Right. Dominic, you I am. Hello. Yeah, I'd like to talk about this serious thing. Yes. I listen to it today. And I think he's going to figure out the values you. Yeah. And. Oh, good. Good call. W. Hello. Got to tell you. W. W. Hello. Why do I keep punching these lines up? You've been with something to happen here, huh? Oh, something's happening. All right. Yeah. Dominic, you're way out in smell of Q.A.M. Hello. Hey, Neil, are you doing? All right. I've had a few of this radio for about a year. I like it. And I was just clicking around after heard you talking about this. I told me forgot that he was doing coming on. Yeah. Just as a sign of getting a show on there. Alex Bennett. Yeah, I know that. That's that. Hell is that possible. And then Samuel say, have a lot of losers on there. I think who is going to be the Martha Stewart's rum. Should I make a name? I'm going to raise right out to get serious. Because Martha Stewart's on. But I found it. And I listened to it for five minutes and Howard's. Howard's starting show still sucks. But anyway, obviously with one quote when you're talking about Chamey about power, absolute power corrupts and absolute power corrupts Absolutely. Absolutely. I see. Absolutely. Five, six, seven, five, six, six, the end. No more will call in. I know he's listening these hours. But I know he'd be calling in. Nice voice. Maybe he's up there. I got your numbers. Somebody kill him. Hello. Hello. Somebody kill me in. Hello. Did you want me to call him? No. Someone kill me in. Hello. Please say something to me. Goodbye. How's that? Someone kill me in. Hello. Hello. Yes. I promise I'll survive through the whole call. Yeah. No, I'll think and go in pretty soon. Oh, God. Somebody kill me in. Hello. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh. Oh. Where does he have the phone when he makes those calls? Huh? We know. I think so. It's here smells like it. Man. I might just take all calls today. You know what? Okay.

Okay, let me get a get into some of this good stuff because these call is going to be tough. Inserting that God certainly needs to be involved in the Supreme Court confirmation process. Three Christian ministers Friday blessed the doors of the hearing room or Senator Judiciary Committees are beginning to consider the nomination of Judge Samuel Lito today. Capital health police barred them from entering the room to continue what they call the consecration service. But in a bit of one upsmanship this re announced they had left themselves in a day earlier touching Holy Old of the seats where Judge Lito the senators witnesses sent it staffers on the press will sit and praying for each of the 13 committee members by name. We did adequately apply oil to all the seats of the Reverend Rob Schnapp who identified himself as an end that's why it's kind of a slippery ride there for a judge Lito fall off he's going to keep slipping on the floor. Reverend Rob Schnapp led in the find himself as an evangelical Christian and president of the National Couragee Council in Washington. Reverend Schnapp, Frank, I keep saying Schnapp rhymes with direct Reverend Schenk called the consecration service to kick off in a series of prayer meetings that will continue throughout the confirmation hearing. Capital health police that they weren't aware that the three and ended the room hearing earlier but added that the hearing rooms typically are locked because they're not of interest to anybody. Lieutenant Dominic Costis said that this year committee room will be swept for bombs and perhaps electric boying equipment before the hearing begins. The three ministers insisted they were taking sides in Lito debate. This is not a pro-Lito prayer insisted where they Reverend Patrick Mahoney a real lunatic director of the Christian Defense Coalition of Realty Disorder you know him one of Mr. Ego's buddy, he'll well. With abortion public prayer gamearies in right to low face shoes among those topping public debate, God is interested in what goes on in the nomination hearing Reverend Schenk said. The two men along with grace, no watch, no watch, no watch, you go. General Manager of a group called Faith and Action read three Psalms outside the committee room not to say the Lord's prayer and marked a cross on oil on a committee door before leaving. Reverend Schenk said he had the Reverend Mahoney a blessed the same room before hearing for Chief Justice John Roberts last year and then hearing much. Very very well. The Lord's prepare of Mokane, the Lord's just like the Lord took out hair all of them. You know I saw someone had crap which I'm trying to avoid that because there's still whipped up into a frenzy about the cool miners. Yes. But I saw some of that crap where they came up with the earliest information that they were still alive. Oh praise Jesus and praise God and God answered that for you. And then all of a sudden like three hours later, gosh dang it, you know stuff. Mm-hmm. Dagmar. Oh good Christians here but we're starting to lose our faith. Ah! Let's say here's a fast it says didn't listen to myself but 13 bucks a month is one thing having to buy all new radios at a hundred bucks plus forget it. What does that mean? In other words it's not just 13 bucks a month that you got to get the you know the radio everywhere you want to listen to your radio one for your car or that little power really hikkey trying to get a kidney. Well Howard Wright who writes for the Chicago Tribune writes today thanks to whoever facts to sin by the way. Howard Stern unscensored uninteresting. How do you like that? Uncensored and un-un-un-un-interesting. If there's a four-letter word or outrageous sex act that didn't get mentioned how it's during new satellite radio show it wasn't for lack of trying rights to Howard. Words that once were bleeped on Stern's treester radio program previously broadcasted in Chicago and WCKG flowed uninterrupted on Howard 101 and the serious satellite for the KWCDs airing students reincarnated show. And though it's true they triple-x-rated comedy bits and saw the on-air pattern didn't wholly define the program the show on questionably plunged more deeply than ever in the material that many listeners would consider of scene. On purely comedic terms over the satellite debut proved surprisingly flat the program unfolding more as a promotion of students latest uh venture than is a was that say something radio show I don't can't read that word look this is a bad facts as they something radio show be oh whatever be up after opening with several minutes of technical difficulties including microphones that produce piercing feedback. I wouldn't you think that uh melt carmison and all the people over there could do better than that with all that big money they got all those millions and millions uh they're wouldn't you think that they be serious I mean the one thing that I've been standing us with our technical difficulties at least our microphone in feedback yet. We did it as long time cast nearly struggled to clearly struggle to find something interesting to discuss is that on the first day? Ha ha ha ha no. The initial report is sounded spares slow and stumbling a palpable let down that even stern seemed to acknowledge. I hyped this thing so much it could never ever live up to anyone's expectations had stern who had as best as proven capable of brilliant center and true political commentary. Before long he was playing unended the excerpts of the Salacious voice mail messages that TV personality panel brine in from his left-hand movements voicemail last year causing a mini scandal aired ribald prank phone calls and played a bit in which an impersonator of David Letterman dubbed evil day described the series of sex fantasies in remarkable detail. Neither the pattern of the show's new announcer George Tech I who was Mr. Sula one the original Star Trek. Is that how you said? I've not. I've not yet. Nurse during stake announcement that he got married quickly retracted offered much more than a chuckle. Who this kind of like? Okay. This was just day one of the program and certainly have plenty of time which to find his voice in a new setting judging by the opening installment he'll need it. Oh man. La Salacious y'all to me. Is that anything a little one or? So far we've had not a single spire report from anybody else and not one. You know, just people that don't like how are you know. Oh, I heard two minutes of an easy always suck in these still sucks. Well, what's that? First of all, he didn't like him in the first place. What are you doing listening to it? Right. Well, I was doing my research, you know, I was all like crap. Not buying it. Just like these people. I listen to Rush because I want to hear what the other side is saying. Look for the QN van. I guess they still haven't given away those damn movie passes. I reckon. Look for the QN van at the Shell station in North West 20, 5377th Avenue, Daryl. Stop by to pick up movie passes. To watch the premiere of Glory Road tomorrow at the Dolphin Mall. Three movie passes. Baby devalued me there to the passes of pass out or they do. One of the other. But not too many people want those or maybe everybody's on the series. Maybe we're done today. Maybe nobody told us because look at these calls so far. Maybe we're finished now. The terrestrial radio is out of business. And things were going to be so good with Joe Bell and charge too. You know, and you guys are moving to another building. That's right.

I'm a 3228-Till known. So anyway, FMQB, which is in the Howard and Factor about 15 feet into his back home man. And I was told you that about their website. What are they used for light in there? Howard may flashlight. Howard's flashlight may be as long as they're hopefully not a candle. May as long a way they view on serious satellite radio day. Well, there were a few technical glitches at the start. Once during the screw got rolling, it was business's usual. The only a couple of noticeable changes in the program. The first is the hiring of George Tech High, to Ky, whatever his name is. As you know, for students program, best known as Star Trek SLU. It was live in the studio for his debut. The other was the lack of commercials. They started with commercials at tomorrow. Six and a half hours. As stars debut when commercial free and lasted, well, the 11 AM hour. No wonder we couldn't get any spy reports. There are glue to Howard, man. Both of them. So they're going to be playing commercials? Yeah. Six units per hour. Okay. It's supposed to be commercial free, but they lie. They lied. More students channel out of kicks off today, including a daily wrap up show with Gary Delabate and John Hine, and that debut of Boba Love Spungeon, and he acted in drive. Delabate took home the price for the first first course word out of during the day. Busy suggested playing Ben Fools, Bitches, H. Schmidt. The later in the program, Stern dropped the first F bomb. Stern also denied during his program that he married longtime girlfriend Beth Astrosky as suggested report sales were. Meanwhile, Stern fans expect a podcast via iTunes. There is a Stern podcast page, currently available iTunes, but today, only contains a woman at 17 second ad for his serious program. In other words, they're not quite so serious yet. But there's the FMQB review, which like I said, there are big groupies. Still got those movie passes over there. I suppose I don't think they're going to tell you when they leave. I'm not going to keep reading that thing. But we're reading it for an hour and a half. How many passes could they ahead? About 30 minutes. 26. We're in choir. Yeah. How many QAM? How many are you doing? Okay, sir. Hey, buddy, for your poll, I can't believe you forgot the best answer for that. Yeah. For 20 years, what do you even tell us of people in this town are? I'm waiting. Light list. Light list. They have two. Light list. Okay. That'd be a crash to be a number one answer for that poll. Okay, light list. Okay, light list. Okay. I have no life. Let's get it on there. Most people are lifeless. You think it's going to be the number one answer? No. No. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound five, 60, leave a rise in singular. All look at that. There's the hospital director, Hadassah Yadia about aerial Surround. Schlomo, Yitzkalk, Proman. Can you to reduce that place for J.B. Next time. So Fati could barely walk and a very surprise that he's having any ailments, sir, too. Yitzkalk, indestated. You think that when you would eat that much, you'd have enough padding that we kind of like buffy against all external forces. How many QAN hello? Now, I'm easy. You're doing a heck of a job. How many QAN hello? Gale. Yes, sir. Sorry, Carl. I listened to part of the Stern Schlomo. I went up the show. Now, I've got you on it because I won't be able to listen to you for a couple months. I can listen to him any time. He wasn't the same. He seemed uncomfortable. It's just wasn't the same show. And if they're going to have commercials, I'm a little pissed. I paid 137 for a home unit. The car unit. And I've got CD in the car. And I've got the regular radio. I don't know what the hell I did. Yeah. Come. You want to refund. Yeah. I would get that. I'm back to it. They said a little PO didn't it? A little bit off his feet after him. You know, forget it's only the first day though. Don't hate. 567.0.560. 560. I mean, Verizon and SIGITTER wireless lines. WQAM. Hello. Yes sir. Just remember they were only two truths in life. You can't win with a black quarterback in the Holocaust never happened. No kidding. 567.0.560. QAM. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. I just call it. Let you know that that's my 1030 at the show. 87.25 is nobody there. No double QAM fan. Nothing. Nice. I think it's good news, Pally. Okay. I have to get it from our audience. I just called Miguel. I said, hey, you're going to let me know when those are done. He said, yep. Of course. Actually he said. So in other words, they're there. That's what he said. I think this guy had the wrong interest section. Northwest 25th Street and 87th Avenue in D'Ral. Which quite frankly, I have no idea where that particular joint is. After the show station, man. It's at the show station. So what do we believe? We believe Miguel who emailed me yesterday. He'd probably give me the list of the Howard for free, which I couldn't do it anyway. And I don't want to hear it. And, D'Ral, we believe this car, who just called is an Ojo for Back at Tour Julio. What do we believe? We need a third. I think they're both full of crap. We need a tiebreaker. Here it ought to be online nine. QAM, hello. I don't like killing a spot. Well, you wanted on there. It's up in QAM, hello. Hey, any likes? I'm pretty good. I would listen to David Lee Roach show this morning. Yes. He's pretty good. I think it's better than how it's done. I think it's better than how it's done. Really? Yeah. It's pretty easy. It's got some fresh new ideas. And he tells you about the rock and roll industry and the topics that's instead of the stuck in the boobs and buy it. And you didn't have Robin doing the news on there? Right. I'm not boring stuff. Anything else, Robin? Okay. I'm glad you're on. Stay on as long as I'm on the punchy. Until I croak man, I'm going to croak right on the ear. I got it all planned out. 560, 50560, pound 560 in the Verizon. I'm very jealous. I would like to be on not serious. I'd like to be syndicated. Forget about serious. Because when you really stop and think about it, they're narrow casting man. They're talking to a few people. A fraction of his original audience. Like this line, the guy two calls are going to go set or three whatever it was. He spent all of that money and then come to find out they're going to be running commercials based on a lie. It's going to be commercial free. Well, guess what? WQAM. Hello. Yes. Okay. I just wanted to make a comment about Pat Robertson and Howard Stern. I've come to our Robertson isn't in on that Supreme Court thing since he's so close to God. And now it's in so well. And then now it's chanting, I think he's speaking. He has seen better days just from the last year's line. So, what we really started to stop, it was a great show and it took us around. We're going to have a scene and we didn't dare out gracefully. And I think that's what's happened to Howard Stern. Okay. So thanks. From Pat Robertson's got better hair, though. Yes. Thanks. Okay. Five, six, seven. He does, isn't he? But he's got lovely hair. He's got a nice dude. He looks like a real, like the definitive guy. He uses Dippity Dude. WQAM, hello. QAM. Yeah, let's think of Neil. Speaking. Oh, look at that. I got a lot of J. I want to speak to Neil. And then that's the material. Very, very beautiful. Beautiful. Done. Guess what? WQAM, hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay. Hey. I bought a series radio. Got one of my trucks. Got one at work. I pay for it. I like this guy to hear all kinds of words. But I can put in here before. I enjoy it. I enjoy it. I got there some fart noises. Some misses. And everybody needs those. So, there was words for this. And there's still a music. There's a guy that's happy. Well, I'm happy for you. All right. Fire it up. There you go. He's got no complaints. I don't want to take an hour and 40 minutes to find one. Put it with words, right? What? Hey, listen. What about what's talking about these calls? You might have to go through 20, 30, 40,000. Maybe I'm exaggerating. I'm exaggerating. You'll get a classic. You'll get some good crap. You just don't have the perspricacity in its anacity. Put it with whatever you hold. What does that mean? I don't know. Because you give up too easy. Only when I'm on. I give up. When I'm on, you want me to read the stupid crap. Right? What's your number one answer to this? Most people are stupid. See? Stupid. Most people are stupid. And I guess I should read some stupid crap. 46. What's that kind of issue again? Sol, over. And then it was. A whole study too. And maybe that way we got Joe Bell as the GM will get our fart sounds back. What do you think? Well, you can ask. Because I know when I talk to him whenever that's going to be. He's probably going to see what's there anything I can do for you. Yeah, it's only one thing about two things. First of all, kill all the salespeople. And number two, give us our fart sounds back. Right. Get on the whole with that choice and tell that bitch. What for? Okay. Some of the preschool boards were not allowed to say. So, and that's right. Like we bagged this one and that one right. Right. Like, hello and Dave. I say on prime time kids shows that we can't say. Right. Most people A whole 32 hypocrites 29 decent 19. Well, that's pretty decent of you. One dimensional 10, reasonable 9, big hits 3, perverts 2, ugly 2, lifeless 1, Solomon Deuno and jerks 1. Although that seems to be like a little slap over there with some of those. Am I right? Like A whole in jerk. But where's the fine line? Uh, her. Can you be a jerk without being an A whole? I don't think so. Now maybe you can't be an A whole without being a jerk. Think about that. It's going to make my head hurt. Maybe you can be an idiotic jerk. I sure wish I had that bitch to understand. Jürg all lot of feed it up to you. Were you? Really? Maybe tomorrow morning. I hate you. Oh, we're in here, concambulating. When the salespeople are coming right in there, trying to course me and doing stuff, I don't want to do. I write down idiotic jerk. If I say all your salespeople are QAM, you go out and sell it. I'll do it. Okay. I don't care if I'm endorsing like, you know, whatever it is. Airlines would blind pilots. I mean, whatever it is, I'll do it. Right? Right. Because we need the money. The beesleys need the money. We'll bat our leases up or move it on down to the kiss building. We're kissing it. Were the ghost of Paxon is having over? God. Those were really some days going to that building. It was a very strange environment in there. Remember that day we got to tour that building? Yep. And there was that WACC that was speaking in glaze. It was like a radio station at Brumcloth. It was like in the bowels of the building. Yeah. Like, oh, there's our Spanish language station. WACC was like, two Julio sitting in an closet, which of course, Okay. So many are. Hey, the M.O. Coast is still thought as number one aging gourmet buffet.

Sharon 77 remains in serious condition as an open his eyes, but he's slightly moved his right arm and leg and is breathing on his own. And his knee as anesthesia, as we reduced the doctor's gradually being it, bringing him out of a medically induced coma. In the pain stimulus test today, we noted the prime minister slightly moved his right arm and right leg and farted very loud twice. There was a very slight movement, but it was a significant one. What do you weigh? 800 pounds can you imagine? Probably like 40 pounds a gas just all over. Oh my god. And if the duke had 40 pounds of, oh, but you know, it's body when he died. Man, oh man. 5.670560. I'm sorry, feces, tools. Oh, once time and I'm talking stool. Sounds like a seat. Then 5.670560, the calls today have been sensational, man. They give me a plus, don't we? They've been there. They have been fantastic. Just like the Miguel Estil, but they're, I guess, they're not giving away to me the movie tickets. Huh? For a baby, well, Louis, I can't imagine why there wasn't a rush. They give you an update or like, and like that? Nothing. Why not? Because I guess nothing's happening. Well, you guess. See, in the old days, there was a call us. We had little communication. This is something market down on my list of 8,000 things to talk to Joe Bellaba. All right. And it's part of the whole QA and keep everybody in the dark. Like, no, come in in, in coming to Cato. Don't come up with anything. Not in everything's a big dark secret. And God forbid, we should tell you what's going on. That's been a whole and scat and worse and worse. Like, I totally agree. The Greg weed rage, you man. You're just like Bush. Was like Bush without all the dead people. WQA and hello. A meal thanks for pushing a doctor box, 13,000, six weeks. So work well. There you go. Thanks. Okay, you're welcome. So the update is. Yes. Oh, the van is still there. We have a lot of passes. And I quote. How many did they give any away? I don't know. We have a lot of passes. See, every question that I ask is, and they didn't say, I don't know where I guess. Is this idiot? Is this invisible capable of communication over there? Can he tell you? We've given away a whole bunch of them, but we still have a lot of mow. We've got like hundreds. We're going to get that guy's number like the flocking. We'll just call him directly. How's that? No, I think we ought to give it out any year. Oh, no. No, seriously. Because maybe the audience can find out what hell's going on over there. You know? This is prophetic. This is so typical, man. The way things have degenerated this radio station. It's just tragic. Thank God we made this move just in time. I can hear a telly better. It's going to right now. If Miguel would spend more time, at less time, we're going to do our one-year Howard Stewart-on series, and more time, more about it. If we knew what that was going out with our promotions, maybe we get something I can't wait for that best and the other thing to go on. Oh, that's going to go down big. But he and the whole piece of it, I'll take it a bite. It's going to go down big. W2AM, hello. I don't know. I don't know if you saw that interview with probably not because you don't want shots, but we're... Whatever. The blitzkrieg in Howard Dean. Now, blitzkrieg was right to... First of all, what blitzkrieg is non-fox? What? What's the non-fox? Well, what we're all looking for? He's on CNN. I'm sorry, you're right. CNN. I saw a clip of that. Same difference. Yeah, well, same crap. Anyway, he was trying to... We'll try to tie the Democrats to the Abramop nonsense saying that the Democrats are taking some sort of kickback stuff and... Right. And so, Dean's going, there's absolutely no proof of that. It goes, what about the Indian tribes that we can see that they took payments a while? You know, Abramap had nothing to do directly with the... What the Indians and they... You know, there's no proof that I've seen in all the reports. Every single person who was arrested, every single person who was in died, and every single person involved is a Republican. He's not one Democrat involved in any of this. What is wrong? We'll also take him deep breath. And at the end of the interview, he just... there's like a seven-second pause where there's no words he just takes a deep breath. It is... Okay. Well, thanks for your time, Senator. Yes. And you see he just takes a deep breath. And he's on camera. I don't know what he's thinking. And you see him take a sigh. Okay. Well, thanks, Lenin. And Dean's start clapping. You know, he starts laughing at a tune. It's like, you can't get those... It was funny. He's a Democratic party on force. Keep getting stuck in this business about Dean's aluzed canon. And he's out of control. Dean is the only one with a ballster to tell a liking. That's exactly right. And that's the only following man, and they wouldn't kick some of the things. Stand up and kick these guys around because they're all pushed. If I could say that. Well, they only got it as a pair. Is there one that's green that the top is has. And he's the one that's green. He's the one that's green. Gosh, we should have ordered for him. The right one, man. Thank you. How do you like that? I told you, based on that he came on here on that same obnoxious talking head network and said the Tom Ridge was just doing a whole, full-neighest scan with a terror alert and reasoned the terror warning. It was just a political play that tried to divert attention to whatever these scandal doger was at that time. And it was right. And then who did they drag out of the closet that the right wing or indivocrentic told the Jewelie Bremen, well I know Tom Ridge well on the audio. All this other crap. Exactly. I've been telling you for a long time, how are you being in the man? And then I put you down? How like a bomb is as much as Timidine. I've been a being in this guy, those far-go men are sort of level of Toronto, when it's close to that sort of where you go, those are all the more important. Look down, but down to mum, add them a lot more more. We're going to stop Carolina. And don't go home on Arizona. I know it's a go-down. I knew that you'd be a girl. I didn't expect this to be your class. I'm so interested in where they are. I'm really interested in where they are. We're going to California. Let me know. We're going to South Carolina. We're going to South Carolina. We're going to California. Let me know if you're going to see me. I did it. I got the go-down. I knew that you'd be a girl. I knew that you'd be a girl. In the fourth child's position. We didn't see him. And all of it. We're going to California. It's a text. It's going to be a call of discipline. Run, play, run, run, run, run, go. We're going to South Carolina. We're going to South Carolina. That makes it kind of like definitely straight away. We can be sick. I'm in the room where man. I did it. We're going to have a head by. I've been here for years. I've been here for years. And we're going to watch it. And you see. I got one house. I'm going to play right now. I'm now at the time. I've dragged him out of the month walls. And we're going to put him out through all over the place. And that's going to cover his pissed off, baby. They're pissed off and fired up. And he's exactly the kind of guy that he'll respond to. So I have a report for you. No, really. Well, how do you like that? Better late to never. I called Roli, who's out there right now. I call him. Idiot. And I said, you know, how many tickets have you given us? He said about 10 to 15, but he has about 30 to 40 to give away. So go get him. Well, 10 to 15 is an exactly like a big rush. Of course, it is a stupid as basketball movie. I mean, and number two, it's out in the middle of Yenem's belt. Does there anybody speak English out there in that area? Maybe like about 30. Two or three. Anyway, look for the QM van. It's still there, man. It's pretty slow. You're listening. Maybe they're all listened to an XM and serious now. You think? No, I'll tell you. Publicity. I think the audience is completely gone, baby. Bye, bye. It's been a good run. Can't get to that 30th anniversary. I've got 30 minutes. At least I still march one. Look for the QM van at the corner of Northwest 25th, 387. With the amount of these shell station in the realm. Stop by to pick up even if you don't want them. Okay, you can go out there in peddleman. Make me get a feel better. And we'll get him off our ass. Although, just said, stop by to pick up movie passes. The watch the premiere of Glory Road to Martha Dalsen Mall. So what's the basketball movie? Yes, but dribbling. Is it ruined on your chin? That must be what does it. Oh, here's the hearings. Oh, this is going to be a little hearings. But it would be pretty good. One day through Thursday, then at 1215, Specter will start the 10 minute opening statements by senators, about 20 senators on both sides. He starts hands it off to the top. You know, this whole thing is so stupid. It is if I have to tell you that, why, why do the senators have to have opening statements? Okay. So they can have a great other than to grandstand for their constituents and for the American public. Why do the senators have to have opening statements just to get a lot of time as opposed to putting his ass on the fire? This is right. Oh, God. This is 5168. This is Dick Cheney. I like to relax. I have a very mackerel in the side of my balls. I listen to the Neil Rogers 12th one hour, but he's been okay. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

I'm going to be preparing their card as well. I'm going to claim that the card changes to the red ring. I just wasn't going to be a little bit longer like this than this. I'm going to finish with the red of red tone first. I'm going to pull the red of that card. I'm going to finish with this. I'm going to keep playing without this värt. I'm going to let you down for a little more often. I'll have some Guidance changed. I'm going to organise the red Lemon. I knew she was much enough to be one of them, the both. 12.02 at 5.60. W.Q. and Jan's Ridgeway, right? He's the author of the Five Unanswered Questions about 9.11. He writes, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and 9.11, how much did the Bush administration know? In San Antonio over the weekend, other, there's our Bush inspector. I'm an early inspector. Supreme Court of the United States. A few matters of it. And is here as well back? Are you a proud man? And that's because God's rewarding him for being so innovative and coming up with that single bulletier in the Kennedy assassination, that magic bullet. In San Antonio over the weekend, the Bush defended the NSA Wartheim program saying, the attack this before the Lattack is again, if they can, and they're going to do everything we can to stop me, be saying. To be polite about this, this is in especially weird statement coming from a president who is administration repeatedly ignored one warning after another of an imminent terrorist attack before 9.11. But in fact, it is clearly administration did know we could be attacked in any number of ways, including by turning a hijack from herhal airliner into a missile. There were at least a dozen warnings from foreign intelligence services of terrorist plans to attack, including some fighting the possibility of turning a hijack back into a suicide missile. Explicit warnings came from British, German attack in Egyptian and Jordanian intelligence and even from Vladimir Putin. In July 2001, just two months before 9.11, there were intelligence warnings that the G8 summit in general might be attacked by tight stuff with explosives. In 10 officials took these threats to Israel up to close the airspace over general and install anti-aircraft guns all around the city and forced out enough of them to choose to stay in a ship off the coast instead of in general. Unfortunately, he thought less about the safety of ordinary Americans than he did about his own safety. Donald Rumswell told the 9.11 commission that the defense against attacks on American soil was not to responsibility of the defense department, but a law enforcement issue. Yet there have been no consequences for anybody in the Bush administration or the intelligence community. Rumswell should have been fired after 9.11 along with the top leadership at the CIA and FBI. Instead, the intelligence agencies were rewarded with an increase in funding estimated that 30 percent of the third man and a free hand to torture prisoners and spy on American citizens. And Rumswell was given what he wanted all along, which was a war with Iraq. 10 was awarded the Medal of Freedom on his retirement. 9.11 represented be trailed by two of America's allies, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, through its powerful intelligence service, Pakistan basically created the Taliban and Afghanistan, and its agent station around that country cooperated with Al Qaeda. It ignored the Taliban support of Al Qaeda. There's little doubt that members of Pakistani intelligence knew that 9.11 was going to happen, including the details. But today, Pakistan is our best friend in the region, receiving a significant increase in USAID. So don't go there. The Pakistani world and all of this pales and comparison of the involvement of Saudi Arabia, Saudis are clearly the major funding source for Al Qaeda, in fact, the person of Al Qaeda was Prince Turkey, who at the time was the head of the Saudi intelligence. He participated in the recruitment of Osama bin Laden, along with other Islamic fundamentalists, to go to Afghanistan and the 80s to fight against the Soviets. And what were the consequences for Prince Turkey? Last year, he was welcomed as the new Saudi ambassador to the USA. Another Turkey. Thanks to the courage and quick action of flight attendance aboard flight 11 American Airlines headquarters knew about the first hijacking, no more than 10 minutes after it happened. This was before any of the other three planes have been hijacked. It was nearly 20 minutes before flight 93 even less the ground. What would have happened if American Airlines had passed this information on instead of keeping it to themselves? Pile us might have been warned to secure their cockpit doors, planes on the ground might not have taken off. Officials in New York City would have known that the first world trade tower crash was no accident and they might have evacuated the other tower. How many lives could have been saved? But what were the consequences for American Airlines negligence? The official was in charge of American Airlines headquarters that day since been promoted to President of the airline. Along with other carriers, Americans received huge government bailouts in 9-11 and to this day they have an institute of the changes necessary to keep their passenger safe. A few months ago, Steve Elson, a member of the FAA's Red Team, undercover former special operations people trained to test their security by breaking through it, travel to Toronto, where would reporters until he picked a lot of all the doors in the Toronto Prison Airport? He thus easily gained access to all baggage handling facilities, all the ranch walkways, cockpit and seats of idle lanes, food, vending trucks and so on. It would be a simple matter to plan a bomb on an aircraft, destined for New York or Washington or LA or wherever. How do you like that? Pretty comforting, eh? Oh yeah, a few nice and secure now. Alright. How's that pull coming? He acts. What are these? Which is a tough choice? What's your number one answer to? Most people are. We got 244 votes. Stupid 74. A Re-holds 47. Epicrists 40. These in 36, one dimensional 14, reasonable 14, lifeless 3, pervert 3, big 3, jerks 2 and ugly 2. Or how about like most people are not ugly, but what would you say? Maybe York will look at me as you. Oh no, Edmiest. By the way, you still didn't. Edmiest. We are here in this one. That took some steps to find out what's going on. We're going to have Roli himself call up after the next break. And we can grind him to ourselves. Well, why do we need to do that if we go already given the answer? Why do we want to put that on the table? That's the minute that you know, avoid several middlemen and just to hit that. Huh? He ain't fat. Well, Roli sounds really poorly done. But no, it's short for Roli. Well, for Crano, a lot of you better get fat. I mean, things really really called Raj periodically too. But you know. Look, we don't have to make that big of a similar set. But I was just looking for an answer. I mean, once again, getting carried away, emotional and hysterical. Right? He's hysterical. Like K. Or like Tony, I'm serious. Excuse me. Don't forget your guy probably could be raw. Oh no. Don't be a couple of people in fan right now. I'm not reading this anymore. If they wanted, they could go out there. I'm not reading it. No, no. First after what we killed it in the yesterday. And what he did to me with that CD business. And you notice how vociferously he denies all of that? Oh, I'm not in sales. I had nothing to do with it. Right. The sales department just thought out about that by osmosis. God, and then he tries to blame it on poor duff. You're fairy. Somebody QAM. Hello. I'm Tony. I'm certain. Yeah, I've got another one for your poll. Yes? Yeah. I think we could go ahead and poll. And there was something about smokers on there. And it seemed like a lot of people answered that. So I think most people are closet stoners. Okay. Why not in sales? Don't do it with them. Turn that thing up a little bit louder. I love that. Did you just something about that whole mentality, you know? I mean, he was okay. Closet stoners. That's right. I guess closet something. Unlike George who's out of the closet. That's right. One thing about everybody on this show, they're out of the closet. Josh isn't there was a vibe Raiders and the George isn't a, no, that long. Right. And you know what I'm into. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. So this movie I saw over the weekend. What was the name of it? Oh, he's very dope. That's a sad part, you know. So he'll hurt. So, we were great in that movie. Imagine here here. Oh, she was great. Oh, that the name of it. I'll avoid it. I like her a lot. So I said, is it's very morbid. It's depressing. That's why. Huh? I want to see a depressing movie. I've got life for that. And why was it that most of the movies, unless it's a comedy, most of the movies are morbid indie pressing. Last many, many years. Just the way it goes. Like Magnolia, even though it's a good movie and read the movie and all the movies are very morbid indie pressing. Maybe that's why people are playing and brains out like crazy. You think? Either that or it's the gas prices. Five years later. It's your president. Thank you, Mr. President for those bargain basement gas prices and the good news is my handyman, Izzy is okay. A lot of these days after getting up beer is in him. He's going to come back and finish that fence. Don't push it as he just relax. Okay. Just lay there and bed and, you know, say a few prayers. I'm a real hot hot set of in cell. Don't drink the wine, no. Please. WQAM Hello. Tell us about that. WQAM Hello. It's real. Yes, sir. How are you, sir? Pretty good. Good. I know. You know, I mean, I'm young, listen. I'm 24, but I mean, you show us great number one. And, uh, what do you think about the stop for? I'm down here from Michigan. It sucks. I don't care for this, say. Yeah, you're right. Where we're at Michigan. Uh, Detroit, actually. Detroit, in that style field, that's why we're running from my where I used to live. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You good. You good nail-pah. What's with this down here? It sucks. People are just, it's amazing. I'm easily breathable, hateful, hostile, unfriendly, anti-social. Okay. I mean, I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding at all. You're a real nice. No, I mean, people hate themselves. I will look at this. I can't even go on. How do we go on? You're not your paliologist. Yeah, I see in my field. All right, but I see how the dick pertinent. Okay. I mentioned a dick pertinent was inducted in the radio hall of fame. Yes, you did. Now, I think I'm probably, after my 30th anniversary, and radio hall of shame, when you think they ever heard of you? Those people? Okay. Oh, no, I'm not just one of those things. You know, this is a filthy, a party mouth, at least I'm yesterday, when we can say crap. Now, we can't even say crap anymore, sorry, I guess it can't be that can't be this. You think about it? No, it's a bad show. It's a bad life. It's a bad planet. And we need to start being a lot more negative. All that crap that any of the Rogers are so negative. Now, I've discovered it. It's taken me all these years to the reason we could have an 80 sure is if I could be a lot more negative. We hate everybody. You know what that? Right? Right. That's a soft food, I think. Maybe negative. Hot style. And retard, oh, that would be the most people are retarded. Oh, we all think that's stupid. We could. No, stupid is one level of it. You know, another retarded is more like, you know, like that. So many of them all over the place. Well, when at Yolven guy came back then, and it was going to be a real winning low boy. The Yolven man moved away, and now he's back up to his old. Oh, yeah, when I heard him pretty this voice, and what's the Yolven's and under's? Very, very sad because one thing about South Florida is that the sewage always comes back. You know, this right, well, they can dump it out the scene. It just watches right back. That is correct. Right back up on show.

What else should there be two easy wins? Las Vegas style gambling cruises returned to Miami's B-front park with Friday's launch of the SS Horizon's Age run by a Massachusetts-based company, not that evil gambling, oh no, how bad. A Massachusetts company's bringing back gambling to Miami's waterfront. Horizons A, which promises Las Vegas style gambling during five and six hour cruises, began sailing Friday from Bayfront Park. The SS Horizon's Age replaces the casino princessa, which operated from Bayfront Park for nine years before calling a quits in July, but Horizons Age of Lin Nash is likely to face stiff competition elsewhere, especially from C-Scape entertainment, which runs a gambling cruise ship out of Fort Everglades. Horizons Age, well I'd tell you, once the slots start in the fair mutuals in a couple of months, those people at Oskarrives better clean up real fast than they'd been to keep breaking it in, raping the public. Because once people can actually go on land without going out there and get in C-Scape and get in there, what a notion. Yeah. Horizons Age will also buy with Seminal Hardrock Hotel Casino and Hollywood, where the hompercity dropped a friend off over a weekend, and the place was just packed. They were packed in a baby, and with permutials in Broward County, where voters recently approved slot machines, and where the legislature and your fan asked Governor reluctantly find the sign to build. David Zion, CEO of Horizons Age said he believes how Florida's gaming market is big enough for another player. When you're looking at a market as big and growing as Miami, to try to attract 150,000 people here, is very attainable, Zion said, referring to past new tallies put up by Princessa. Horizons Age has an agreement with Miami to operate from Bayfront for the next seven years, and the same spot is used by Princessa. Horizons Age carries about 500 passengers and flows more than 75 people. It's one of two gaming ships operated by Horizons Age. The other ship sales easily from Boston, during a summer's in fall. When I was studying, are you ready to top aboard? Plugget got out? No. Oh, and now, how come QAM, my bat line? Yeah, I do it, chief of trolley. Hey, Roli, what's going on out there, nothing? Dude, I'm gone. That's it. Get them all away? Yes, sir. Nice gun, Roli. I apologize for not being fat, but work on it. Not talking to the one, but I'll make sure I get a top of it. Okay, I'll bet you will. Come back to the station and see some pizza while you're at it. Yes, sir. Oh, for me. Thank you, gentlemen. There's Roli, Poli. Don't say that. What? What's going on? Roli, it's funny. I like that, Roli. What doesn't it, doesn't it figure? Roli? I'm an enrollee's duet. I know Roli. But you're not a baseball guy. He was the skinny. He was the great relief pitcher for the local NA's with a big handlebar. Mustache, I bet you even Josh may have heard of Roli fingers. No, who's he? Of course. Yeah. Oh, don't kill me, you think? Of course. I've mentioned people to you and you're like, oh, who you like that made up person that I looked up? And it was no such person. Who's that? I remember. I don't remember. I'm a Schmender. He was my next or neighborhood. I met him. Time he Schmendered my ass. You better get with your Jews. You should don't know your Jews, man. Just like that Mickey Mendel. You better start hopping on top of it. So we gave away all the tickets. I took a hell of a lot of effort. And that's fine. Because Stearn probably went on to about 1130. So we had no audience. So we had no audience. So I'm in 30 now. We get a bunch of spy reports on that great Stearned AB1 serious. Not that. I really care one way the other.

Equality Utah called a disappointing It's a shame that such a beautiful and award-winning film with so much buzz about it Is nothing made available to broad Utah audience Because of personal bias he said Salt Lake City All in Mormons man They're 20, 30, 40 kids They make the earth an oxgyzzled like tigers Yeah, good thing they don't in the gay But don't tell me ten candidates speaking Justice Lewis Powell spoke for all of us when he said Equal justice under law Is perhaps the most inspiring idea of our society It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system Were exist As we have seen from Justice O'Connor's example Even one justice can profoundly All for the meaning of those words Top of our ears Even one justice Can deeply effect the rights and liberties of the American people Even one justice Can advance or reverse The progress of our tyranny So the question before us in these hearings is this Does Judge Elydo's record hold true to the letter And the spirit of equal justice Is he committed to the core values of our constitution No That are at the heart of our nation's progress No And can he truly be even handed And fair in his decisions No In a way Judge Elydo has faced this issue before As an nominee to be court of appeals I have the privilege of sharing his confirmation Saring in 1990 And at that time he had practiced law for 14 years But only represented one client The United States government And I asked whether he believed he could be impartial And deciding cases involving the government No And in that hearing Judge Elydo said on the record That the most important quality for a judge Is open-mindedness to the arguments And he promised the committee that he would make a very Contrary to be absolutely impartial Don't we want to hear a lot more of this now While I love Ted Kennedy man he's great Too many was such a slime ball, but he's great In spite of all the redneck right when you're saying Here's the fact that says for your poor police put

senate And it is our duty to ask questions On great issues that not to the American people And to speak for them Many Republicans senators certainly demanded answers from Harriet Myers We should expect no less From Judge Alito There is no time for a double standard If confirmed Judge Alito could serve on the court for Generational more and the decisions he will make as justices We'll have a

But there's a lot of offers for our country. I'm sure that we do the most important thing, which is to protect those who can protect themselves. And the debate raging today is about whether we'll continue along that path, or whether our courts will continue to be in, or whether our courts will continue to be one of the places where society have pushed the little guy. And I know this is not leading in the position of the world. And we'll be there in the same footing with a big guy. The one place, David, is equal to Goliath is in the Supreme Court. And it's also important to note that you're slated to replace the first woman ever nominated for the Supreme Court. We can pretend that's not the fact, but it is. And through no fall to your own, we're cutting the number of women in half on the court. And now, as I said, that's not your fault. But I think it means that we have to take at least speaking for ourselves a closer look at your stands and issues that are important to women. And moreover, just a so-calleder, broad critical. I tell you, I do buy in the sheer boring, isn't it? That just him. Oh. Well, let's carry the hearings. What do you say? All week long. Ooh. I mean, it isn't as good as he calls we've had today. Listen, how can you compete with us? During the morning, we got the Alito confirmation hearings starting in noon. We're up against it, man. Right. And we're up against it, man. Right. And hey, what it be, is rising amongst South Florida Middle School students are ratios. They're doing it right under their parents' noses. It's a whole, what a pun. Middle school students in Palm Beach and Broward County's increasingly are taking a sniss of computer keyboard cleaner, lighter fluid, other household products to get high. According to the most recent states, our wave youth and our substance abuse. This disturbing surge of inhalin use coming after a decade of decline naturally is prompting social service agencies in both counties to be tool prevention programs in Tritoway community awareness. They face a tough challenge because, at less than certainly internet to chat and learn about vapor producing products, go anywhere to buy and obtain them on the cheap. All while other parents are too busy or too naive to realize it. Evangelia serves who son as an eighth grade student, a Spanish river Christian school in Boca said, she brought him to a community form because I want him to be educated. My parents never taught me about drugs. I have run on my own. Georgia's parents never taught he had to go out and get his own. And I still do. Georgia's 14, how many knows that inhalins are kind of stupid, as what he said, thinking of stupid people. Most of the kids do it know the dangers they do in any way. Oh, maybe they're suicidal. What do you think? Stupid. Or just stupid. Or stupid. An answer was subtle. The 2004 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey over 7% of Palm Beach County middle school students before using inhalins in the previous 30 days. About 30 men. Up from 3% to 2002 survey. In Broward 7.8% of middle school students claim to use inhalins. Up from 5.9% to 2 years before in both counties. And inhalin uses higher than statewide. Well, if you live in South Florida, you'd be sitting at a hit your hands on. Even the dogs go, yes. Sean? Now my work. I'll try it. I mean, we at least would tiny. You could hold them still long enough. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Let's give it a shot this hour. How this is going to be the hour for the good calls. You'll see, yeah, why don't you go nationwide? And you also go to the whole country. Can you hear what a bunch of bulls those live in South Florida? Are you doing a public service? When you think? Oh, yeah. He's only been out 400 times today. Uh, pros and cons. I don't know that I can throw them. Maybe he has drugs right now. And that might be it. Or maybe he needs different ones. Jesus. God, maybe he needs to sniff some right guard. If I said that, that's right. I'd just be sniffing some more lighter fluid right now. Just stick it up or no, isn't it? Kind of light light it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. 5, 6, 10, 11. I think the reason that most of the callers went away is because Great, we left. Don't you think, don't you see the correlation? You took them with them? Yeah. No, they need to respond to it. Just think they're going to be the same old crowd. No, mole. WDQ, I am. Hello. My phone, we're in. Wow. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, I think we had enough of that one. I think we're going to do the same with him with a guard over from now on. No mole. It was just really a shame because they'd like every once in a while to come up with something good. Everyone's in a great one. Great, every third one. But on balance, on balance, I would say no. No, my. WQ, I am. Hello. My room's coffee, 14,000 off. WQ, I am. Hello. Hey, Neil, please. Yes, we're speaking. No, I got nothing. It's never much. Okay. It's just one of those days. They got no material. Maybe several of those days. No, I don't know. I haven't had too many of those. Maybe I got nothing. There was a lot of unsentrated today on a Monday. That's a lot of different pool on there. Who's your favorite person? Who's your least favorite person? Who do you hate? Who do you like? Paper or plastic? Paper or plastic? Paper or plastic? Normal or spastic? WQ, I am. Hello. Yes. Hey, Neil. How are you talking? You've got something I think is important for people. If anybody is thinking about doing what I was interested in, phone services, don't even think about it. Really? Oh, they're awful. They don't work well. They have to cause drop. It's just a nightmare. And trying to get your number back is like a two month process. And the meantime, it's literally like a hoax to have it all the time. It's a joke. If anybody is thinking about it, trust me. Okay, we trust you. I'm not doing it. Now do you know what you know about those? That there were a sponsor for a while? Oh, but they're not no more than I know. Well, at least after this call. Five, six, seven, five, six. You will maybe cross the street. They're trying to sign them up. Tell me the Q.A.M. Hello. Hello. How are you doing? Well, I'm fine. What's that? Say I, well over the weekend, my wife, fortunate to go see that movie was a bareback mountain. Oh, my god, yeah. Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my. I'm not used to things like that. Really? No, not on screen anyways. Huh, offspring? Yeah, just on screen. I've held on to your weekends when a wife is out of town. I'm a woman. There's a thing in there, by the way. And it's one of these things I don't think anybody's noticed it. But there's a few very briefly where one of the guys is on a horse. And you can tell just slightly if you look real close that the saddle is on backwards. R, R, R. See you. He thought it was funny. Yeah, he thought it was a panic. I think this guy's right inside saddle himself. Five, six, seven, oh, five, six. See, he just not used to them things on film. Like you said, just in real life. W, W, K, W, N, hello. We all can't be as funny. W, K, W, N, hello. Yeah, that was the real goal. That's the, the only first true gay cowboy movie in Hollywood was blazing saddle. There was a lot of, there was a lot of fairies in that in that movie, sir. Uh-huh. You said, well, that's good. W, K, W, N, hello. I, I, generally 24 years since I took your picture. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh. Can you believe that? I, today I believe anything. Right. Chronicle. This is like a, who's been dead if he called it wouldn't surprise me today. Exactly. Woody, we need you like we need him, right? Okay, and then we got the, uh, what's the other one? That we wouldn't run the first cars. Y'all been, we got the open guy back. But did they circulate an email or something that I don't mean? Yeah, but, Ellie, come in to Q, I am, hello. Q, I am. So I'm now going to pick up the poll, beating from how long the old beach I am. Tell me to Q, I am, hello. Hello? Yes. Neil, hey, um, I have to just end the movie. I started Friday. There is so little sexual content to the movie that it's ridiculous. But it's a, it's a phenomenal movie. It's, it's so good. It's really so good. But I mean, these fobes that are saying like it's like the porn fest, they're, they're either tree. Who said that? Who said it was the porn fest? Everything that you read in the paper all they're talking about is two gay cowboy lovers. And it's all, and it really has very little to do with the story. Two people that just run like, no one love. And it just wasn't the time for that to be together. Exactly. But I thought that it all right. Well, it's, it's still very, very good movie and it's not like, you know, they're not nesting every two minutes exactly. Every two or four of us, and I'm going to give me a boot like, can't be even watching this week. You'll enjoy it. Okay, thank you. My deal will stop you, but you'll enjoy it. Okay, well, after that side, so, thank you. Bye. Bye. I don't know how enjoyed it. I do like Jake, give a whole, a lot. He was in Johnny Garco, right? I don't need Garco. I didn't see it. He's good. Whatever was it I saw him and he was good. I always get him confused with Zach Galligan, not because they looked the same, but because of the name. I guess, Zach Galligan was one in, uh, Gremlins. Correct. Remember that? Yes, I do. And then he got hit with a case of the ugly, so bad that, uh, refutes your theory by the way. But I want to argue with him about that because you're the expert. All right. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound five, 60, and they've arisen and singular wireless line. All the time, Brady sure, uh, holds up your end. So to speak. I had to what? No, seriously, I don't know what it is. He's 20 years old, which is hardly ancient, but man, he just keeps getting better looking every year, Tom Brady and playing better, too. Even Joshua to be with the last part. Yeah. I mean, he's, he's no Chris Sims, but. Yeah, I tell you one thing, when you play a game and you like, you're like 30 out of 40 for like 60 yards, I mean, there's something wrong with that, you know? Look, you're going to get yours, okay? They're not going to win it this year. I got to leave. Not me. You're not listening to me. You're getting all defensive. I mean, the whole bunch of passes and they're all like for 2 and 3 yards. That's not exactly a game plan. You're saying, well, the Gruden's game plan. And what kind of a game plan is that? You know, maybe that's why they can't score any points. All these 2 and 3 yard passes. What's the point? All those great 10 point 2 yard passes. I just, uh, really, you know, I'm not going to pick on you. They'll why you're done. You got your ass kicked by really weak team, by the way. At least at least Hank is finally winning Washington's sucks, which they do. 12 minutes after one at five, 60 or sports station, maybe we're going to be so sports-intensive. We're going toward that super bowl. The Panthers are starting to turn it around, maybe. Well, they got games against the Lewis and Columbus come up. They can't win those games. They're all whole man. Woo! Good, golly Miss Molly. And for those embarrassing and humiliating losses in Jersey and the islanders and the Rangers, man, all man. Couldn't score goal into an empty net. 113, I know the George has been really disappointed. Much. Not too happy with the work of Dave Straterly, either starting to owe the Eric Weed thing and talk to his teeth again, I'm a two-key non-nad.

This is Joe Bow on the Voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God! Are you tired of the same old same old wood it comes to ice cream parlors? Sand boys! Well, you're in luck! From a company that brought you to successful ice cream chain, Basket Robbins 31 flavors please you the first ever inner city ice cream parlors from public enemies number two rapper introducing Basket Robbins 31 flavor slaves. Yeah, boy! That's right. 31 flavor slaves. We pooled something in the ordinary ice cream. Instead of a boring old chocolate at 31 flavor slaves, it's called Scuba Chocolate Bixie Boy!

I'll all more bad news, Miracers and update. And this seems funny. I'll be re-revering any of the good news from our right. Here seems to be the deal lately. You start out with one number early in the day and this keeps their growing. They just have to keep putting the body parts together. Well, do exactly. Two suicide car bombs exploded outside of our heavily guarded and tear-ministerly and bagged at the day. Kill in at least 20, wouldn't it more than 25, many of them policemen. Last time is, more than 14 civilian vehicles. The interior ministry is located next to the police academy. We're a ceremony parade celebrating the 84th anniversary of the formation of the Iraqi police force for the singing place at the time of the blast. And they like that. I don't think maybe they ought to take a little hiatus from parades and public demonstrations and say, well, I love a parade, but nevertheless, how can we can be on the march if we can't march? It's a matter of fact when you can write down, why do people watch parades in a front line? I don't know. I don't know. We had yesterday and over the weekend. They did. They did. I want to say that floats. We like to see the floats. Gay. Now, what parade was it on Thanksgiving? Where does somebody damn you got killed in Detroit with the macy's parade? What are those? Remember not to, one of the street arts, whatever. On their head, whatever the hell was. Well, I don't know. It's one of those things that the people are into. Don't ask me why it's like religion. They're into what heavy duty, but I haven't got a clue why. Maybe they're a fear to death. That just could be it. Or maybe they're just stupid. Here's the poll. What's the number one answer to this? Most people are stupid. 1.38. There you go. That's why the religions have a field day. 464 votes. Stupid. 183. Decent. 77. Most people are just good playing hard work in decent folk, aren't they? Yeah, okay. No. Pipercript. 74. One dimensional. One dimensional is got. But third man. Reasonable. 24. Biggest. Nin. 36. Prover it's six. Only five. And jerks four. Okay. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. We see 15 stitches on his list yesterday. After he and his 12 year old son were involved in the motorcycle accident near the LA Homish folks who were said. Schwarzenegger was riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle with a son Patrick in the sidecar when another driver back into the street. The governor was unable to avoid the vehicle in his path to the low speed. Most works of the egg were in the summer treated for cousin bruises. I'm drunk up about it. St John's hospital in Santa Monica and released. Both were wearing helmets at the time. The other driver uningered. Aren't you excited about that? I eat grapes. I'm a great one. I want to know what a Pat Robertson has to say about that. That was a warning from God is what it was. What got saved from it being anyone. That was a warning from the Lord. You better cut your crap on old. Okay. Or you're going to be next. You and Hugo Chavez. It's been a year since I was a kid. I was thinking of 85 million reasons not to go on cruise ships. The other day was like, some kind of a misstep on a cruise ship. I really caused being an MSNBC staff will be there for weeks on and after we're trying to piece together the year. Oh, she is just brutal. It's unspeakable. She's unspeakable. But I'm going to tell you something. As bad as she is, compared to the more in Connie show, which they've used yesterday, she's like in a word. So you're peaking like curiosity about that. Oh, I just couldn't believe it. I watched about two minutes. Oh, like when Hank asked me if I started the thing with Matthew McConey, and Terry Bradshaw on the internet. And then he told me he liked it. And I didn't. I watched about a minute of it to see what that was. And it was pathetic. Did you see a Josh? No, thank God. Oh. First of all, anything Terry Bradshaw has involved in is got to be so stupid. And so it literally, it's so ignorant. It's just, it's indescribable. And then this is what they're appealing to. You see, I just don't understand. In other words, if I'm a football fan, which I am, I have to be that dumb. Is that, is that the deal? Is that the message that the networks are telling me that I have to be a moron and watch these extra slaps on each other on the back and high five, and then yuck it it up and fake arguments back and forth. And there's Jimmy and his Johnson who just rake it in the cash, laughing up his ass, you know? What a fool me here is. Jimmy's Johnson. And you sure talk to the game. No. You're full of cram Jimmy, okay? Anyway, the cruise ships getting back to that officials researching Saturday for a 15 year old girl from Ireland, who they sent her off a ship near East La Mujeres, the island of women. Is that what that is? The favorite island, right? A Caribbean island near Cancun, that's popular with tourists. East La Mujeres, while I send a, who, man. Very, very. Where do the, where do the, uh, Spanish get there from? I think they had a, I think with the king had a, like a fraud. They were what I was talking to throw. Maybe Isabella. Maybe she had some, she thought, you know, was something interesting, but it's not. The coast of Magic Acru ship was 26 miles away from the island and the pre- Dawn hoursters day. When the teenager fell out of the Caribbean, according to the ship's captain, you're simple Russo. Just simple Russo. So, Schmaltzie, man. Russo identified the victim as Lindsay O'Brien. Did I, well, what are these names, you know? Like I'm watching the football games over the weekend. What are these names? I just don't get it. I guess there are too many people named Mary and Bob and Tom and John and the boring names. So we got to come up with something fancy like that book of Brian's. We need something fancy. Lindsay O'Brien and didn't divulge her hometown. Newspapers and the missing teens native Ireland spell her first name, L.Y. and I see Y. however, and reported she was from Dublin. He spelled it L.Y. and Lindsay like Lindsay but it's from Dublin. Maybe she was Dublin or pleasure. Rob Seek in the distance and slowed the surge stage in our all-medina, a federal official at the office of the poor captain on East L.Y. and S. While air rescue efforts continued by a Mexican Coast Guard helicopter, officials were no longer optimistic about finding her live. Guess where the ship left from? On January 1st. I don't know. For? Lot per day old? Nah, it's the one. For louder day old. I'm January 1st. I'm planning to spend a week visiting sites in a so-called reviewer of my undercanned Cune before heading to Cuba. It had been scheduled to arrive at the island of Cousin, El South of East L.Y. and his early Thursday morning, but was delayed because of the surge. The Italian fact, a flight coast imagine, a corresponding fleet of coast occlusions, which is controlled by Miami-based carnival, Culp, the world's largest cruise operator, Slippin and the Mickey, baby, how do you like that? Another one bites it us. And they still haven't found that guy that, where all the blood in the room and the big refight and the brawl and everything that guy that the visitor, right? It's time to found his ass or the rest of me there. On our year-round, Neil, there's no vacation like going on a cruise man or it's not like cruising it. You have in cruising. And for those years long ago, when some people used to be cruising, biscane Boulevard till 345 in the morning. Remember those years? Not yours though. Hey, there was something out there for everybody. And of course, now there's like a different disease out there for everybody. I'm thinking. They still like hookers on the skim full of art and not. How do you touch my am? Do you think? I don't know. How would you know? You never on this game Boulevard. I would see you probably about as far south right now. No, I take that back. Now you're going to have to get a passport when they move the station. That's true. Because they're going to move in the railroad. What? I go over here to best buy all the time. But this is about as far south as I get as I was there. No, but what is it? 150 something that's a good deal. No, no, no. It's like a 180, 89 something there. Oh, it's only a few blocks down the road. Down the highway. Like just throw it to my body. Garden. It's like one block. I mean, don't you think I know I was there. Is it in time to pick up my packs and checks when I wasn't working? When I was a boy. Four or one eighty-five. So maybe Joe goes going to have a good news for me to go to a penny for next three years. But no work. Maybe once in a while, a can be a guest appearance. Like you're holding on to for it. Right. Hold it up for your life. What do you think? Anything else a good idea? Hey, if you were to did an end job and underpaid like poor Josh court, I hope I can get some good news on your raises. Parents talk about your rays yet. It's all the way to the ninth of January. What do you think? No. Well, no, no, let me forget now. You know, you're sitting there when parents comes in every morning. If he happens to show up tomorrow, I'm sure he will. Uh, put his feet to the fire. Okay. I'll help you. Like I have all along. I'll like put a gun to his head. They cut the crap clearance. You idiot.

This station presents real American heroes. Real American heroes. Today we salute you Mr. Egghead, Jeopardy-contestant. Mr. Egghead, Jeopardy-contestant. You, sir, are in view with the God-given gift. To respond to questions that are actually answers with answers that are actually questions. And you can't ever single one, right? Yes, you've accumulated a vast fortune, Mr. Egghead, Jeopardy-contestant. Would I head full of knowledge at the fist full of pleasure? Do you think more money than me? And you're all whole lot more than Alex. And that really is the amount of money. Also, until the next time you think you're smart enough to be on that show. Pop your brains of the couch and drop your jaw. It's a look to Mr. Egghead, Jeopardy-contestant. A real American hero. Mr. Egghead, Jeopardy-contestant. Sorry for all of the questions, please. 27 till 2, what's the really bad show on it? It's 730 every night. What's your authorized spine skills into Wilito hearings? I know it's over my head. You were said, huh? There actually is a Jeopardy-contestant. Stomachine game, by the way. Is there? Yeah, I haven't played it. In fact, they're almost, you name a TV show, like sitcoms and all this other crap. And there's like, well, it's like, it's like, it's like games. Yeah. Three companies? There's what, uh, family feud? Okay. Maybe I'll just start trying to different the games. What do you think? Like, uh, improve your luck? Yeah. Or, oh no. Or crush it, right? U.S. senators challenging Stanley Rulito Supreme Court nomination, our focusing on a potentially combustible issue to raise it to the confirmation and restart today, the limits of presidential power. The next several days, the members of this committee will question you to find out what kind of justice you will be. Senator, say, Alito, isn't that pretty profound? Oh, yeah. These are the opening statements again. Total wasted time. Senator, say, Alito is writing, is endorsing a strong executive of taking new significance, since the disclosure that dictated George W. Bush authorized E.V. dropping on Americans without court approval. See, here's another riot. How many, uh, how many reasons that we got for Bush to be impeached now? But turn man. I would say at least, right? And in the meantime, but a bit, but a bit, but about when he's in a rose garden this morning and, uh, talking crap. Democrats have decided the issue is so politically potent that they're leaving questions on abortion, mainly to Republicans, attacked it that runs the risk of offending some of their strong supporters. The intense focus on presidential powers on the other of some women's rights groups, which have traditionally played a central role in Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Now they're still put move by the Democrats as usual. Grasping to feed from the draws of victory, which is their speciality, do you? Even two Republicans on the Senate Gd to share with committee, Chairman Arlin Magic Bullard's Spector of Pennsylvania, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, say they'll query Elito, they'll query him on the responsibility to court to constrain presidential authority. The spying raises very fundamental questions about how we proceed together in information. Fundamental questions on privacy and the bill of rights practices. They'll write for that. I remember those. Don't you just a little child? That'd be a good thing I'm doing a pull about things you miss from your childhood, the bill of rights. There you go. Be free speech. Hmm. I like that. 567. Are you going to take a couple more calls for this half hour? That would be really a bad mistake on your part. Ah, come on. It'd be nice if we had some. Well, I've been a rambling there, man. I've been a rambling there. I'm a little busy. Speaking of that, during the next break, the other video is up on the website. The video is up on the website. How do you deal with this? Well, this week and Howard Dio, bear in mind he asks him one very boring question first about hisism and then they go into the whole Abraham Octane, which is funny to hear. Wolf's reaction when he doesn't get the answer he wants. I see. Like speechless. Huh? Oh, the the side, the heavy breath side. Ha ha ha ha. Too bad Wolf, okay. Take off the hymnboards. You're out. 567. 560. Let's get a thousand calls in between now and two o'clock. What do you say before the mole monster comes on? Let's get with it. How many QAM hello? Hello, Neil. Yes sir. How are you doing? I got one people. Okay. How about those local TV news shows that has their viewpoint or shows that they come on Sunday morning? Yeah. You get tired of those. There's that one old comes on. I want to put it over. You're going to do it with our pool. I'm going to understand. What does that have to do with the pool? Isn't it a show that you tired of or something or whatever? Yeah, I know it's caused that we're tired of like yours. So that you're tired of? Where do you get that? Who knows? Probably you've pulled it out of his rectum. Yes. God. How many QAM hello? A Neil. Yes sir. I'll tell you what about that movie bear bag mountain. Right. I'll make you a bat. I wouldn't steer you wrong. If you go that movie, you don't get for clumps. More than one time. It's a love story. Right. You're in simple. They don't like who's loving who that's their business. But it's a love story. How about you dinner at Rupon's takeout if you don't get for clumps before the other movie? Okay. It's all right. Okay. Okay. We're going to be on the temperament to see it. He'll be at that time. If you say I want more time, you're going to be at that time. He reached this quota. He didn't want to say like choked up in the tiered up and stuff like that. I got choked up for the other day that one of the other night that imaginary heroes. Okay. And it wasn't just because Amyl Hirsch was in it. You're good acting in that, especially by a Sigourney Weaver. And nothing popped out of her stomach either. Well, I guess Amyl did. Oh, all the way to turn out that his daddy wasn't really his daddy. Oh, I shouldn't have said that. Oh, that's bad. You're bad. Well, it was good. Everything was excellent. And the only problem was the ending. I'm not going to scroll it for you. But the ending was like, it was one of those abrupt turns. You know, hit that. And all of a sudden, everybody's happy. And everybody's smiling. And they're all dressed real neat and clean. And the kid graduated from high school. And he plays the piano up there on the stage. And they're just, oh, it's just, but I guess after all the griefs. They put you through what you needed that, you know? I did get a little tear there toward about two thirds of the way through it. It was kind of sad, you know? Oh, I'll have to watch it. Plus I could relate to the part about having a real piece of crap father. All I wasn't really as father, but he raised him. But it wasn't really his biological father. Well, boy, would he be well refreshing if you found that out? What? That the guy you thought was your dad really wasn't? Well, what difference is him? He's still screwed up your life. That's true. So all that accident of biology, you know? Yeah. Now, I say, why is it that most guys I know have had horrible fathers? I don't know. Not so much, not so much women, but men. I don't know. Do you understand? Now Josh there, he's got, I don't know about his father. And the answer is divorced. Yes, they are. And your father was a good guy. Oh, see there you go. And there's one. And a stepfather is a good guy. See, he had two good dads. We can go. We didn't see no one to abort to us. Yeah. I'll be damned. Five, six, seven. You're a father on your dead dad. What not to be dead, but of course if he's alive and you're from an asshole, probably cut you out of the will. Right. Right. I got the license. See, I found out in that obituary that my father died in a, what do they call an unown of nursing? Maybe what's nursing? Hostess. It was at it. That's what usually were they, uh, take it. Well, what do you mean were they take to run out of the clock when there's a no way they can do for you at the hospital? I see. I'm going to take a look at this. I think it was like a retirement home. We're all Jews. Go. Yes, I'm like that. Where miserable, he fold Jews like him go. Where they can cruell about that wonderful son on the radio. It's such a star. Are you think? Anyway, he's rotting somewhere. I guarantee that. Somebody to a m. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. I want to speak new. Speaking. I knew. I was a hot day, right, man. Okay. It's hot. And I'm sure George will rather the rob stick than new to go on. All right. All right. No, I need to check it out. It's not right. All right. Yeah, I'm not Friday. Better than moving. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. We'll check it out. You see it? I don't know. See in Florida when I showed you the choice in Florida. It's called HOSTI. That's what I thought. HOSTI. I thought it was in like, huh? I thought it was a movie about South Florida. Right. Hustle. No, that was called Malice. That's when I was saying about before. With Malice toward all and the justice toward none. That's not Florida. It was just amazing. I'll go back to what see. A lot of people all year, so it's sour. Add you such a carpet bag. You know, 72% of the people I'm allowed they take like 400,000 votes on that Sun Sinal Pool. It was like 6,000. And 72% that they either wanted out or they were working to get out or they were definitely leaving some Florida. 72%. That's not exactly a music for the Chamber of Commerce's Rear. This is a new rock record. This is 5. 16. 8. Much bobs and buch and biking. Absolutely. I suppose a bush has heard that project day and two months of price this custom shame. We met the soldiers in the late and get away and shifted the blame to Sir Don Hussein. We're out through playing. Hey, how's that bad? No, not the ones who were tired. What's going on with this spot? I'm out. We're working fine. I'm out. Six minutes of the record was all having fine. And so as I was ready for the more time, we've won the body properly. So only just these on for the energy we and hello Bertrand. We believe that they send their hearts into the dark. And the ruling of what's still support this guy. An advanced agent simply must feel the reason why they made your choice. This Jesus Christ. Sir, I'm out. We're up to a party. Are you out? I'm out of that. There's not the ones who went down. I'm out of that. What's going on with this? I'm out of that. I'm pretty lucky you're part of the IWI. Boy, George, why do you make so many main patients? You know, Sir, we're a ship. It's our war. Did you invite me to a star door? Who's our our war? Do I see on the TV screens that I already is? Yeah, I'm very back. My discovery was hard work too. 14614 built too. It's pretty sad. Pretty sad America is like, but what the fuck like that? Wow, all these innocent people are dying. For no reason whatsoever, but nevertheless we got a wolfless creature under. Nice going. Eric, he's got the wolfless creature. How are Dean clippin? Pretty much. Give it down to where the other video stuff is. What it loses is freshness. I see. Oh, kind of like a scouran. Well, that's what I heard. I heard he lost their freshness. He years ago. But third man. Yeah. Anyways, right under the poll. Okay, take a look at it. It'll give you a chuckle. Okay, to see how this purple-flow squeegee is. That goose stepping a pedantic jackass on CNN. Yeah, I just watched this pretty good. Yeah, good. I'll watch it right after the show. I don't want to get distracted. Now we got a big high page, Joe here, man. Before and before we finish today, just to be not be outdone by Stern. We're going to say the effort. How do you like that? Fire effect. Nobody has said it during your free break. I didn't say on the year necessarily. Funny to do. The round the clock availability that cell phones and pages have brought to people's lives. Maybe taking a toll on family life, a new study suggests. Those who just love the people who take studies like this. The study was following more than 1300, also over two years. Found that those who consistently use a mobile phone or a page or throughout the study period were more likely to be port-negative spillover between working home life and in turn, less satisfaction with their family life. Spill over a sensely means that the line between working home begins to blur. Work, live me and bait home life when a page parent is taken jabberly to cause it home, for example, or household issues may start to take up work time. In the latter scenario, a child may call mom and work, not to say that he is English-thased, but that the microwave exploded. Yeah, the problem with cell phones and pages seems to be that they're allowing forever. More spillover between working home and that slot over, according to the findings, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family. What am I favorite payout not? This may be especially true for working women in the study found. Among men, consistently use some mobile phones and pay you seem to allow more work issues to keep it in the family time, but for women to spill over tend to go in both directions. Being connected means that work cut into home time and families use seat in the work live. It's a seat for men. It's nothing worse than having a seatping problem. Is that it? Just the small? Oh, man. Yeah, we already heard about the moves tracks. Despite a widely held belief that neocons, many of them Jewish are behind a war in Iraq about 70% of Americans used now opposed the war according to Mr. by the American Jewish Committee. And that guy in Israel may be typical. The survey also found that 60% of Jews in the West did not approve of the Bushman of the St. Hamburg of the Camping Against Terrorism, not comments only 60 ought to be like 95. You know, back in 2002 before the Iraq War almost 60% of American Jews approved of Bush's handling of terrorism and supported military action moves Sodom. The Jewish publication of Ford reports. But by the fall of 2003, after the Iraq attack, only 43% of Jews in the West approved of the war and 41% had a favorable view of the camping against terrorism. The latest poll conducted by market facts only 28% said they support the war. 28% of Jews, you know who they are, don't you? Like Jew Leberman, and like Richard, all those are right wingers. And Ms. Drog, self-hating queens. Among those poll 26% said they're, this is the thing I find amazing. 26% said they're extremely conservative, conservative or slightly conservative. 29% said they're moderate, which means that 45% said they're liberal. And that surprised you? Well, I forgot that liberals had already worded that. Sorry, 45% said they're, like, Farkovs. What was the word that got kept using for our clumps? For Clintus. They're for our clumped. Well, I'm speaking to Jews. Let's start to do a whole Jewish show segment here. What do you say? Oh, hey. Hugo Girl. Air me one who worships at the Tabernacle quickly. They're in three facts about its deeply conservative past Rendandil Virginia. He comes from a broken home. He rides a Canary Yellow Harley, and he loves the Jews. He's like, Barbara, Stirli. I love the Jewish people. I love my love, my love, my love. She actually was saying that on the earthenight. I mean, just that way. I love my love, the Jewish people. And she, oh boy. She also loved Senator Hill in the kitchen, but nevertheless, there's some murmuring about the motorcycle, but the 2500 members of this Bible, believing, finishing respecting Southern Baptist Church in Southern Virginia, having raised everything else about the Reverend Lamar, Mooney Ham. That's his name, Mooney Ham. Mooney Ham, Mooney Ham, Mooney Ham, with an M. Ham, as in all the bad eggs. Out of his painful childhood experiences, Mooney Ham 57, preach his passionately about the importance of home. Out of his reading of the Bible, he preaching with an equal passion about God's continuing devotion to the Jewish people. And God's devoted to them. That's why somebody even been slaughtered throughout the years, because he likes testing everybody all the time. How's that test going? Not too good. Can they yet? No. I feel jealous sometimes. This term that keeps coming up in the old book, the chosen, the chosen, says the ministry has made two tricks to Israel, and named the son's Isaac Jacob and Joseph. I'm a pardoned Gentile, but I'm not one of the chosen people. They're the apple of his eye. I think he probably means some of them are rotten to the core. Scholars of religion called as worldwide, final semitaz, and the opposite of anti-semitaz, it's a burgeoning phenomenon, an evangelical Christian church across the country, a hot topic in Jewish historical studies, and a well-spring of support for Israel, and the guy over there who's breathing on his own today, breathing heavily, but nevertheless, and they Jews are nervous about evangelicals and tensions in recent weeks, leaders of three of the nation's largest Jewish groups, the anti-defamation, late-demircon Jewish committee, and the union for reform Judaism, have the pride what they see as a mounting threat to the separation of church and state, from evangelicals involved in by the beliefs they have an ally in the White House, and it stands to shift the Supreme Court. Make no mistake. We're facing an emerging Christian right leadership that intends to Christian eyes all aspects of American life, from the halls of government of the libraries, to the movies, to recording studios, to the playing fields and locker rooms, from the military to SpongeBob Squarepants, the A.V.L. National Director Abraham H. Foxman said, in November 3rd, it's P.I.N. even though SpongeBob was Jewish, a V.A.S.A.M.U.R.J.A. A V.A.S.A.S.A. The A.V.L.R.J.A.S.A. The A.V.L.J.A.S.A.S.A.
