the Um, New York. Oh, it's not got that short show on Thursday and hopefully I'm Friday with at Hurricanes. You go Cains. Yeah, I got the chip. Well, didn't really chip. That's a long story. It's boring. Yeah, maybe I should go to Greensboro with everybody else and check out the Cains. Yeah, that's a great idea. I don't think I'll be doing that. The New York Daily News I noticed today because the German Jackson was on with your buddy Larry last night, which I almost, I just, the only child channel surf to see who he's got on. But I was fascinated because the last couple of days have been reading these stories on the ear from New York Daily News about this. Tell all book he was going to write German Jackson about Michael. And the last night, all of a sudden, like he got hit by a lightning bolt and he retracted everything. He never said this and he never wrote that and but it would be put a move. But I wonder, well, how come he didn't suit the Daily News then? You know, it seemed like a massive lawsuit. And I look into the Daily News today and there's nothing. I mean, it's like they never even wrote you other stuff. So, who knows what evil lurks? And of course, poor Kirby Puckett, he's dead. Yep. And Dana Reeves dead. Chris Reeves wife, he's dead. 44. Not a long cancer, never even smoked. Yep. The die-like flies, man. Kirby Puckett, of course, the fact that he weighed 700 pounds or whatever he weighed probably didn't help. You see the picture him at the Hall of Fame ceremony? Yeah, he was having a start with it. He looked like Marlon Brando in his last couple years. I saw the biography on biography channel. I taped a couple of nights ago as a two hour deal. I watched it last night, Brando. Great actor, but boy, he was sure, I guess he could be very strange man. He had issues. And he had like 10 children by about a whole bunch of different wives. Yep. He bought that island in the South Pacific into Haiti. And something I did realize, he had a big battle. You know, when he went to acting school in New York, here's roommate. I knew this was Wally Cox and Mr. Peepers. Did you know that? No. And they were very close, literally and figuratively, but anyway, so when Wally Cox died, he had a big battle with Wally's mother over who would get the ashes. He was cremated in Marlon kept, he was, she finally gave in because she felt that he needed them fourth inch she did. That's exactly what they said in the biography. So anyway, he kept the ashes then when he died, his ashes and Wally Cox's ashes were sprinkled in the hills of like Adam, Arizona, or a sesame dam place. Mr. Peepers and Marlon Brando. Yeah, they were peeping. He couldn't hide and creep in an island. Marlon was doing everybody that was breathing, I guess. He's just a wild and crazy guy. But he made one of the strangest sexual movies that was in England, Paris. Yeah. That was a, did you see it? No. It was really weird, the whole thing. Yeah, it was a little bit, it was a little bit. So was he tough to concentrate on? But yeah, I could not forget with you. And they showed that he was, he was, I guess, the third choice for Don Crollion. Who was the person? I forget. I forget. Well, it's he was the three who were up for it were, so Lawrence Olivier was one of them. And I forget who the other one was. And Brando was like, through choice, but couple awarded him. And so when he looked, they forced him to audition for it. And when he went to audition, he was the one who came up with the idea of like, put the pot and not in the pot and then he cheaks in the whole deal. And he was just the blue to moway, you know. Yeah. You know, it's, George came to my rescue this morning. I was trying to remember to lie, you know, they actually died at this, uh, this gangster, who's, ecstasy kingpin from Israel, right. And he's flying to Miami. Well, let me tell you something, my friend. Yeah. And I expect when they put a microphone in front of him, he will be saying, I'm just a retired investor with a pension. Right. Like, I'm in Roth. Yep. So, he's a little younger than I'm in Roth. You know, Brando was, he never finished high school. And I don't think it was a put on. I mean, he talked, they showed him early interview when he was early acting days. And he was like, uh, he couldn't speak. He does he mumble. And so he went to acting school, shakes to, well, isn't it? Shakespeare and what he did? Whatever was they did. The zoos Caesar. And so he went and took allocation lessons to be able to do that role. They showed him a speaking very eloquely. I would, is this just an amazing kind of guy. I thought his best role was on order front. Yeah. He was great. But he wanted to ask you for that. Terry Moloi, he was incredible in that movie. Even recent. Yep. Lead J.com. But the character he played as name was Terry Moloi. Yeah. Lead J.com. First line of the movie. And the company, Joe Doyle off the roof. Carlton Maldon was home and then we were the big nose. He said, don't leave home without it. Yeah. First time he said that. And that was a great movie. The two guys stand and down in the bar and they can't let him die. I was the root of my fellow. I think that's true. Somebody off the roof. And the other guy said he could avoid. Could sing, but he couldn't fly. Hmm. Great. So I'm issues though. There was the other thing with his son, you know, shot, uh, the daughter's boyfriend. I don't know what that was all about. Chris, or Christian Christian. He was a good Christian. And then they showed the thing for Godfather when he wanted to ask her for that. And he sent the Indian chicken to where they showed the clip. They were bullying her like crazy. They practically boot her off the stage. Shia. Huh? Shia. He had written as a long speech for her to make in the next. Because she had one minute. She had 60 seconds. And the speech would have gone for half an hour. And so she came out well. He doesn't want to accept it. You can't accept this award because the way the American Indians have been treated, they've up up a bond, the crowd starts booing and hissing. Yeah. So when he didn't mutiny on a bounty was when he got into Tahiti and, you know, just so decide to buy that island, right? Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you, George. Oh, I just saw it last night. But I mean, well, it was, now it was just the dentist man. He didn't really do anything. But, so you're going back tomorrow. Tomorrow morning you're going to go back and he's going to do all the filling to fill him. He said it's time for it's almost poor. I'm going to stand for to fill him. Some of that. On that. He said, no, he don't home and touch him before I feel like those holes up in it. Yeah. See, this was a tooth that crumbled about, I don't know, a few years ago. And some of my dentist down there put like a temporary, like a ceramic tooth on the outside and a meeting something other than all of a sudden I felt like something crumbled and like a dog. You know, it must have been something in that meat and it was with my sweet tooth at the filling. Yeah. So I got to go and put it back together again. Okay. Well, other than that, thank God. I found me a good dentist here. And now all I got to do is get off my ass and call my doctor. Listen, I got a really good family practitioner lives in my building here in my building. So I call him and I can do all my doctoring here. I can do it. I think you had the right idea. Just cross the border to Niagara Falls, New York State for a weekend. They got that good day. They got a big casino over there. Yeah. And then get my passport stamp. I think my days and Florida are numbered in single digits. I just can't deal with it. Just is not for me. I mean, there's something in life that are for us and there's something that are not for you. Everybody's got their own, their own bag. It's not my bag. You catch my drift down here. They have their own bag. Yeah. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. There goes again. I didn't mention it. I know he was thinking, no, at least I was anyway. Yeah, pop has got a brand new bag. It has a different meaning in Florida. And then he plays else. That's right. You can be sure of that. Yeah. I think that real route awakening was my last flight up here. I told him I was sitting there in Fort Lauderdale airport in the wheelchair brigade. Kimballer and had five people in wheelchair is lined up to put on first to come on this flight up here. And I thought, what? Of course, that's proud. The average average age in Broward is deaf. God. So many old people. That's, I guess that is good though to come to our once a month. As a matter of how old you are, you feel very young. I'm coming back to Thursday and I should be feeling very young. I feel so young. Huh? I'm flying north to Fort Lauderdale on Thursday. Can you imagine what that crowd's going to be like? Oh my God. You've talked about the aroma from those overflowing bags. Oh God. Yeah, when they have the flights to Broward to Fort Lauderdale, instead of having a peep bag and they have a different kind of bag for each seat. Just in case you want hook up here. Keep going for a couple hours. So you're going to be in New York for one. I'm doing a television show there Wednesday night on the SPN night to go. I remember when the SPN was really good. Who the hell was your buddy? He was, he just tripped the SPN. Who was it in the post? Oh, Phil Moshnik. Till Moshnik. He does it every day. He does it every day. He does. Really? I mean, he's done one. I never read the post because it's right we can garbage. But he does it to the point where it's just got an tire. It's the same stuff all the time. But they got a good sports section. I'll tabloids always have the better sports. For example, when I came back from the dentist this morning, I stopped and I every day I get to try to start the trial somewhere. Four papers here. Those are the two I get. Star is very liberal. It's pretty good. But the song is a, it's a report mark. You know, it's a right wing piece of crap. But the sports section is great because it's a tabloid. That was the paper I handed to a very jackass to the airport that then I said, you ever read this paper. He said, no, I said, well, take a look at the sports section. You'll see what a real sports section is like. Very good. Yeah, I did that. He looked at, I'll count. I'll read it now. What did you say about me is true? Yeah, I know. I can tell by looking at you. You idiot. You fairer guy. What a little tub. Chicago has a good tabloid sports section. The sun. Times. No, that is, yeah. Is it the sun time? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, you're right. I mean, the Tribune is as stale as last year's on, I'm not talking about the Tribune. No, no, no, no, I'm just saying that's the choice of you got. There was the American too. But never the day yeah, there was. And of course, there used to be the record American in Boston. I mean, I every city had like four or five newspapers. New York had half a dozen. You know, that's why I think it's happening. The newspapers New York used to have about 10, 15. Yeah, there was the mirror. There were all kinds of paper. The news and the mirror. Harold, Harold exam. The time is the Harold. You got four daily's here and that's pretty unusual. So that should tell you that there actually people here are reading newspaper. The journal, American, the World Telegram and the Sun. They just remember they used to be after known papers. Well, actually, once upon a time when we hit the Miami News. Yeah. And then the Fort Lauderdale, you remember the Fort Lauderdale times? It was the Sun Sentinel afternoon edition. Remember that? I don't remember that. Oh, yes. Was it called the Times? I don't know. It was the afternoon edition of the Sun Sentinel. They used to be a morning edition and the afternoon edition was published by the Sun Sentinel. There was an afternoon paper. Oh, you had four papers basically. And then the news, of course. So the problem with the news is that the circulation was controlled by the Harold. So they were all the ugly stepchild. Yeah. And then they got there to keep it in the live. Sure, they put them out of business. News is pretty good. How's my old friend Howard Kleinberg doing? He's OK. Does he know that for a fact? Yeah. He just did a book. Really? On the Miami history of Miami. He's the Howard and his wife at the hockey games all the time. And of course, I used to work with his son Elliot back in the old days, back in the day. He did a book on the history of Miami Beach. Sure. By the way, I can tell now that Howard was always in favor of casino gambling. It was his one thing that he felt bad about. He used to editorialize. I guess because they didn't want to piss off the Harold. So the news would editorialize against it too. But he secretly was in the favor of it. Oh, yeah. Not that you're ever going to have it. I mean, you've got to slide. So I would, I don't think it's going to go much further. Hey, by the way, can I just get a stupid question about that? Yeah. Now that the slots have been approved, and I would imagine within two, three, four months, you're going to have them going. Go on. July. Well, see, March to April, May, June, and as four months. Yeah. How come the Indians haven't already switched over yet? I think they're in the process. Are they really? I mean, they seem to me that I have. I would be doing that right now since it's been made legal, at least in Broward. You think that the hard rock would already be legal for them. It's just legal for the parametrials. No, no, no, you don't understand. The deal with the Indians is whatever is legal in the state. Right. So that they can do it. And of course, the fact that that's legal in Broward, they should be able to pick up and take right off of it. And of course, I know they want to do the whole class three gaming now with the, you know, crafts and the whole deal. But it seemed to me that there's slots ought to be the wheel machines now on. They should be. When you think? When it's soon as the tracks put them in, why is that? Why do they have to wait for that? I mean, I hope they do because I'd rather see the per mutuals do well, rather give them the money. I think it has to do with the legislation. No. You don't think they'd have them in there by now if they could. I don't know. I really don't know. I mean, I know they're selling those cancer sticks to the white people. That's a different business. Man. You didn't want to put it in the middle of the day, though. That's right. Well, again, they can't look a little more slowly. Yeah. They extricate your money more gently. Not. Go listen. Have a great day. I'm going to be at the dentist tomorrow. So I'll see you in the New York. All right. You're going to be back on a Friday? Yes. Now, what day is poor? I'm doing all that? Maybe. It's right around saying Patrick's. I think it's a 16. Something like that. Like I said, right around. I see a few minutes back. A couple of dozen those still home enticing from New York. Some green drails. They're going to get there. You go for saying that. He's dead. All right. I hope we'll go somewhere to more. I'll go get the green bagels. Yeah. You know what I said? I don't need to get green bagels every year. Yep. That's a problem of QA and too many glam. Okay. I have a good trip. All right. Don't suffer too much tomorrow. Now, it'll be a piece of cake. All right. In fact, I'll give me a piece just to calm me down. See a good thing. Bye. Hey, all you time stealing measles.

And nice chat with Karen's yesterday. And remember, in Godfather 3, and George Hamilton says to the Archbishop, we later, of course, we'll get the guy. He says to the Archbishop, we had a deal. Yeah, when they're trying to back out when he likes to go out and make a color over the Vatican. And the Archbishop is, we have an understanding. Remember that? Right? We have an understanding. So we have an understanding. Everything's fine. And in fact, I'm actually going to play the clean up of that Enron thing for our Josh Cortis there. And the next door will come back. Okay? Just to show you what a, well, I'm not really a fine job, but it's a little bit. 1014 at 560 WQM. We got bowl again today at 2. In case you were ready for that, we got Curtis for the Mad Dog at 4. There might get overworked. Hurricane Hotline from 7.99. It pretty close our steak house in South Miami. The beast at 29 and 80K at 10 o'clock. No ball games. Panthers lose again over time. The shootout last night. They got a point. But what's the point? No chance to deploy off. They got about as much chance in a playoff as the Leafs even less than them. Two teams go in nowhere. So I would download. Keenan, I would unload baby by Friday. Get with it. Start rebuilding. You got no shot. Hey, beat four does gone. Man, they got a good shot for you. Get fatty.

Yeah. Remember we have a few shot in, you know, that's what DVDs are for. That is correct. Get some DVDs. Get some DVDs. You're DVD by getting Netflix. Obviously, if you're the way around. I didn't see any form in 80. Do some hazard. One, 83. One hands down your pantalones in your DVDs. I hate this pool. One, 16. Various mounting. 112. A very good choice. Piece of crap. War the world's 85. Doosh, big or low. You're a P and Jigalo of 78. I think we just like the way that sounds. Let's just say that all day. Say, doosh, big or low. Get Richard die trying 43. Star Wars 3. The, uh, Revenge of the 7. And what it was felt it was a piece of sift 33. Heating. And matter how you re-re-re-rins those letters. I'm sure that's what he had in mind. Well, what is, I'm gonna ask you again. What is a sift? You know, they're a race. I see. House of wax 31. The hitchhackers got in the galaxy 24. Doom 21. Fantastic 4 and still had 20 of piece.

The old the grid read a bio. Heiden seek. You know, I think he could be in the Guinness Book of Records for the fewest return phone calls in history of any general manager in the radio business. I'll take record of it. Anybody period forget about radio, huh? I'll check the record books. Yeah, check the Guinness Book of Records. I think he's in there for a fewest return phone calls. Supercross the movie 7. See what he would do is he would make a deal like with Rimmer or D4. Somebody then, uh, okay. Well, when did I start an ennab with call lead messages and he would never return a call. Guess who's six alone in the dark five, Domino five, the fans Domino story and thank God he's walked in in New Orleans, he's okay. The fat man. He was always my favorite right. Into the blue for my man. He finally got one. Aren't you pleased? I have no idea what that is. I don't know. I'm so guilty. My man. Nine songs one and undiscovered had the big. Oh, I guess it really is undiscovered. Nobody knows what that is. So those were the worst movies. We know all kinds of stuff about crash. In fact, when I was at the dentist waiting in the last week's time magazine, they were predicting that crash was probably going to be not very as mounting. And of course, what's the producer, the director's name, who also the co-writer? A crash? Paul Haggis. Okay. He also was the co-writer, they won a one last year. What was the movie to one last year? That's the ladies. Huh? That's the ladies? I just got this guy through reading it. But anyway, he's a Canadian boy. He's from somewhere. He's Canadian. It's okay. Get over that review. You read yesterday. What a pilot. When I was writing it. I got news for you. This will come as a great dismay to you. But there are a whole bunch of reviews like that. And like the time magazine, Arthel, which is pretty good. It's not a crazy lot. But it's said that in some of those movies, you either love it or you hate it. And there are a lot of these students who hate it. Pretending, of course, that they don't get it. Or maybe they're just so stupid. They don't get it. And the same students are probably raving about broadcasts now. Oh, of course. I don't think there's any question about that. Although even Roger Ebert, he was the most enthusiastic about crash. He said, he predicted it would win. He also was said it was one of the great all times. I know it is. I love it. I see. It was me. It's like Magnolia. I don't know what there is not to like. I mean, you want to make it sound of the answer about the answer. And that's, you know, when a movie goes on for three hours for a crash makes like Magnolia. No, no, no, nothing is enough already. We can have Magnolia too. But it's interesting. The movies that should have sequels. They're the ones that do do. And the sequels almost always suck. San Antonio to the Marlins include locals. I am so tired. There's very jackass. I'm sure all of you are too. I don't even waste my time on it. San Antonio, which is expected to present a stadium funding proposal with Marlins this week already has established one prerequisite. The team must add, San Antonio area minority owners of the Marlins move there. And a telephone interview. Dexter County judge Nelson Wolff said he discussed the matter with the Marlins. Apparently, don't have no problem with it. Wolff said he has presented names of any minority owners of the Marlins. Hasn't spoken with Jeffy Lorette yet, but but it's better than that. But you're crap. By the way, million dollar baby one. That's why you thank you so. And he co-wrote that. He wrote it. Oh, I guess. He's not a role. In fact, after we did that, we'll be at a heart attack. Let's see. What do you mean? After he did million dollar baby, right? God punishing him. Well, who was in that? Clint Eastwood Morgan. Oh, there's a Clint Eastwood. I was the tragedy of the baby. I hired the razor blade. I didn't see that. You're lucky. Anyway, now it's interesting. You want to believe see. I think 44. All you know, the same Kirby Pucker was 45. But the article I have from sports illustrated.com says Kirby Pucker died Monday. They have to the Hall of Fame out of fuel. It had a stroke. And is there also on a home he was 44. It's got a picture of him during his induction to the baseball Hall of Fame in 2001. If he was way 45,000 pounds, then my name is Ish Kavibil. He just enormous. And like I said, I just saw that clip. They showed him up with the twins. Hit him one out. You know, and he even then when he was playing baseball, he was as big as a house and had an ass. He made sense. He'll feel there. Look like a child. Yeah. Look at you. Oh my God. He was big. He died at San Jose Hospital in medical center in Phoenix. He had been in intensive care since having surgery. Another hospital following his stroke Sunday morning. He carried the twins to world services in 8791 before his career. We're short and short by glaucoma. The hospital said Pucker was given the last dressing died yesterday afternoon. On behalf of Medilee Baseball, I am truly saddened by the sudden past Kirby Pucker. He was a polyphamor in every sense of the term. The plaintiff's entire career with the twins was an icon. And once a pot of time on CNN, the former Black guy, a new banker, and I don't know who the hell it was or what he's gone. In fact, I remember he called him Kirby Pucker, but with the didn't say Pucker. Remember, he started with a different letter. I remember, like it was an H between the P and the U. And I thought to myself, P U. Remember that guy was that big fat black news anchor on CNN's long gone now. I don't know. And also, Christopher Reeves widow dies. Yeah, you remember I told you what had happened. You were sitting right there. Yeah, but I forgot. Oh, I didn't. Because then he corrected it. And he just kept going right along like he never said it. You know, I mean, if anybody was said that on CNN worldwide TV, they probably should just get up and walk off the set. They knew Reeves, who won worldwide admiration for a devotion to where Superman has been Christopher Reeves, who is decade of near-total paralysis, also died of lung cancer at 44, 44 is not good. Let's see, Robbie need him. I used to be number 44 for the Panthers, who else is 44. I think we were a Kelly and a Browns was 44. I'm pretty sure, yes. You know, any other famous 44 athletes, just 44? Five. Tom Rathman. Have you heard of him? Don't know who that is? No. Not to know who Rathman was. Rathman. That's what I just said. You said, Rathman. Our ATH. Do you want me to rewind the death? No need to do that. Leave a singer-ranker to give a similar home career to be one of the nation's best knowing caregivers, died late Monday and Memorial Sloan Federal Medical Center. As a matter of fact, she got on the same day as Kirby Pucket just hours later. She wasn't a smoker, but an honest and august that she had been diagnosed with lung cancer. That's really a bitch. Probably that second-hand smoker. All you have not just smokers out there, cut her cram. And this is new Rogers. This is by 62AZ. And they don't come anywhere else than new Rogers. Ah, there's more how to name it, isn't it? But I'm here to tell you about my new product. Essence of mold. No, it's a candle seeing that smells just like me. As I walk this way, seeing that I'm a happily married man. I don't have that gay guy smell. It's a delightfully aromatic blend of alphranken, sits and bird rippet. Cool smell that smells like the 1950s. But you didn't know the 1950s smoke like toast. I'm not imagine that there's a mole candle. You just don't know why you're watching golf.

I got some bad radio news for you. Wow. This is from the New York Post. Air America. Are you better you better strap yourself in? Unstraft. Our in 20 minutes till Frank in. Yeah. Air America is close to losing its New York flagship station knocking out Frank in and his little colleagues off the air on their second anniversary. The network has a two year lease with WLIB AM 1190 New York. That's reportedly said to us far April 1st and at least one reliable report says. It is extremely likely that the deal will not be renewed or to turn it over by the other way around. It's extremely unlikely that the deal will be renewed. Got it? Got it. And you like that? Losing its New York outlet would be a serious blow to the fledgling liberal radio network. Radio equalizer blogger Brian Maloney. Who ain't full of Maloney? He blew the whistle on question to the left in the network last year. Published the first report that WLIB was on the verge of victory. America sometimes soon. Air America's options for a new home are not promising either. All of the city's other strong civil stations are spoken for, leaving only weeks in full of fringes stations that don't cover the entire city in the burbs. Air America parent P.Con L.L.C. has reportedly been paying inner city broadcast and controlled by former Manhattan Burr oppres and Percy Sutton and his son P.R. $2.5 million a year to air Frank in the others. That'll be a bit of a vinaway on the air. Kind of like the guys across the street there. You know, they're Jefferson pilot and we're auto pilot those guys. Right. And American and Air America's folks will be told the post. It's business as usual in decline for the comment. Well, what does that mean? In other words, it's not looking good. Air America got unwanted headlines last year when it was learned that previous men had been at received one of the best of it is called an inappropriate $875,000 loan since we paid from a Bronx charity. Calls to what our city executives were out return, the leaving contenders to take over the WLIB lease are former clear channel executive Randy Michaels. Oh, no.

You know with the stations license it's the same thing everything is always mixed Oh, you can't say this and you can't play that because we don't have our license back yet.

These are tribal people who are maybe Shea because of the religious fanaticism how do you what is even the concept of democracy? It's so alien to these people that the idea that you're gonna impose it upon them and kind of an excuse for having gone in there It's on a face of it at insanity.

I here's another example of what America's becoming and that well This has been going on for a long time, but it's reached to take it a new Taking it to a new level Dodge City Kansas This pad this is written by Ed live and Darryl CNN He says this past Saturday morning I find myself in a five-car car caravan cutting across the Kansas planes with about 30 about 30 Just protesters in the back of the truck there were signs that read thank God for IEDs and thank God for dead soldiers I was with the phelps family They've lost a disturbing campaign to turn us the funerals of fallen soldiers This is a painful drama playing out at dozens of military funerals across the country the group is led by the insane Fred Phelps. That's my word and saying he is a region of America He and his family a picketed and heckled more military families and more than a hundred funeral since June They said the soldiers are fighting for an army that represents a country that accepts homosexuality I've spent a great deal of time and last few weeks tracking the movements of Fred Phelps and his family Saturday I followed him and his family from their home and to pick a Kansas to a funeral and die city Kansas Fred Phelps is the pastor of Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka The congregation has made up mostly of his family. Phelps has 13 children 54 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren He describes himself as an old-time gospel preacher who says you can't preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God Phelps and his family have made a name for themselves by showing up at high profile events preaching their hateful brand of Christianity They blame homosexuals for the destruction of America This past weekend's target was army sergeant Jesse Davila Davila was killed for a 20th and a rat by a suicide bomber he served as a marine after graduating from high school He returned his civilian life. He had a daughter, but he was always the soldier at heart So two years ago he joined the army national guard Which we know there was no national guard in a wrath of course He joined the army national guard was three months into a Iraqi deployment when he was killed There's also very much a story about another phenomenon on the Phelps protests is created. That's the birth of a group called the Patriot Guard writers The Revolentier group that came together after hearing that so many military families were being blindsided by the protesters More than 400 motorcycles thunder toward this showdown in Dodge City this weekend to make sure that Sergeant Jesse Davila's funeral was not overshadowed by the Phelps protest They converge from small towns all over Southwest Kansas to support Sergeant Davila's family One group leader says I knew we'd have a crowd by it. No, be this big The procession of rolling fund was escorted Davila's family from Memorial Services to the graveset on a quiet hill in the end the sergeants family says they were only able to hear a little bit of the Phelps protest. Davila's mother Linda Claus no create a relation to Santa C. L. A. U. S. Linda Claus since he's grateful for the Patriot Guard writers. She also wants other military families to be where this could happen to them When people begin to know that Fred Phillips family is what they're really doing killing the American dream They won't be around for a long because nobody's been let them they'll drown them out they'll be gone Claus said Since he had been started airing reports on these funeral confrontation a few weeks ago They paid for their writers say it's membership is almost tripled and more than a dozen states in our considering legislation They would restrict protesting at femorals The Phelps family vouchs to continue these protests. They might be outnumbered, but the way the Patriot Guard writers see it won't take some one of them to the son of the memory of a fallen soldier These people have no shame right if no decency They're what Christianity and right wing fanaticism become all about in Zion America There were a TV the other day. See at it. What are those channels? How to support them? Don't bother yes, family the his daughter was at one of these Funerals there Which one of them?

I got an article here that you're going to love. I don't know if John's a big John Stewart fan. But you tend to hate him now. No, no. That's not correct. I said I liked a daily show. I don't want you that much. But why I see the clips from him. It's funny as hell. And it got some good writers obviously. We take whatever's going on. And really do a great job of satirizing it. But we'll say what you want. But even fashion again for two days before the show. Don't like him. I know. Craig. Well, my entire little opinion. There's a lot of time. Sheels writes who's the award-winning TV and the critic for the Washington Post. Not that he knows anything. He says memo to John Stewart. Keep your daily job. Crash was not only in the only film chosen best. Let me try it again. Crash was not only in the film chosen best picture with the 70th Academy Awards last night. It was also the sound made by the show itself as metaphorically speaking a drove into a wall. It's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars. Hosted with a smug humorlessness by Comic John Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great host gone by. The movie Munich was represented in one category, a musical score by a clip in which suspense built over a bomb that didn't go off. The Oscar show and NBC televised live from LA was a bomb that did. Film buffs and they politically minded me while we'll be arguing today about whether the best picture Oscar to crash was really for the film's merit or just to cop out by the motion picture Academy so it wouldn't have to give the prize to broke back Mountain and movie about two Cowboys who fall reluctantly but passionately in love. Mountain won two of the major awards leave me up to best picture best screen play and best director for angley. It is expected as acceptance speech, we said the movie wasn't just about a homosexual affair but about the greatness of love itself. I didn't see any love and I'm moving whatsoever. But the Academy ran out of love for the film at that point making crash, the surprise winner to its credit crash, which won two other Oscars deals with important social issues, two especially racism and American society. Among the more beguiling acceptance speeches was that given by Reese Witherspoon George's favorite, who once will play in country singer June Carter and I walked the line the story Johnny Cash. I never thought it'd be up here in my whole life she said with ingenuous charm. You also quoted June Carter's distinct philosophy of life, I'm just trying to matter. And George is just trying to swatter like a mosquito. Program look gorgeous and high definition TV from the quote I feed her but it was filled with so many cliffs, piles and piles and miles and miles of cliffs from films present and past that the visual lustre was squandered. The audience at home doesn't want to look at clips of once the look at big-time movie stars. Unfortunately those have an increasingly short supply. When Jack Nicholson stored out to give the best picture price of the evenings in, there wasn't an only innovation, but a huge sigh of relief in the audience, the sense of the whole crowd saying, oh yes we still have giants in the business. Although I guess he's down playing Dustin Hoffner, it was wrong with him as he chopler. Well he's little and Jack Nicholson is really big and fat. No he's not big, he's fat and squat. This part was made early as well as when Merrill Street been slowly Tomlin and mashed a lot of one we'd about that. Stewart began to show drearyly looping through a monologue that liked a single hilarious joke with a possible exception of Dior couldn't be here tonight to his terminology on a rossic red dress in Dick Cheney Schottor. And I was mildly amusing and I would agree that was the funniest thing he said. That was about it and Stewart had five months working with his legions writers from the Daily Show on Comedy Central to come up with good material. It goes to prove that there's still a big, big difference between basic cable and big time never TV after all. The liveliest moment of the night was contributed by hip hop ensemble 360 Mafia performing an nominated song. It's hard out here for a pin from the film Hustle and Flow. The group practically brought the house down leading Stewart to ask following the writers performance. How come they're the most excited people here tonight? He said more Oscar acceptance features should be his rolicking but it's the host job that generated seven and two in Stewart-Generated None. There was a cute bit take before he appeared in which past host turned the job down. Billy Crystal and Chris Rock said no because they were sharing a tent all our broke back. Even David Letterman was joke for years about slapping his an Oscar host made a gracious reappearances if to say no hard feelings. Letterman's hosting gig however was better than Stewart's by far. For some strange reason ABC decided to play music on a most of the acceptance speeches and set it just happened in music interrupt winners when it was time for them to walk off. Perhaps the music was there to facilitate the use of a 10 or 15 second delay part of the new morality inflicted on TV by the FCC which lobbies finds for naughty words e-muaness book and spontaneously and would no man so forth thought on shows like this. Among other highlights Jessica Alba's dress. Jessica Alba. The handsome plexiglass latter in the facility is some dramatic shots from distant front of the stage. The usual tastefully done in memorial montage from film figures about since last Oscar cast and Jennifer Lopez looking particularly attractive. Oh god I must have missed that. What was the best documentary feature for the film March of the Penguins had the clunky bad taste to bring stuff penguins out of the stage wisdom. It was a joke that later penguins saw a thing. The epitome of honesty perhaps came when Stewart muttered on the loser into the microphone. He was speaking not only for himself but for the whole show. I don't agree with everything he wrote in there of course but nevertheless I think he's got a sum on it pretty well. I've summed it up. Josh didn't even watch the show so how do you know how John Stewart did. I don't know how he did. I watched like 15 minutes of it here and there. I mean it's not that I just like him personally like I saw him on King a couple nights. Last Wednesday night for a couple of minutes or whatever night it was. I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I was like I'm done I'm going to bring good way to analyze it he's excellent at what he does stick to what you do the best don't try to be like all like any more for you know stick to the comedy and stick to the transvestites in the cars and don't try to be a singer don't try to be there. You see what I'm saying what he says I'm saying that not not nobody can do everything but will Smith you know just go away stick to what you do best go away Here's the story that I was attracted to headline is what got me on this one. That's a lot of pizza. Oh for me! That's exactly what I had in mind was. That. Maryland and companies private equity are basically to my private and held NPC international awards largest franchisee of pizza had restaurants and PC set in the same year today. I'll tell you one thing, well you go anywhere in the world. Oh and guess what we're doing this morning on CNN? What were they doing this morning on CNN? Dricken coffee. Okay. They did blind taste tests and overwhelming. They had some much left out there in the streets in New York and then the people in the studio and then what's his name? Scumiles of Brian and solely dead of Brian and Paddle Brian and all the other of Brian's. And they were like taste and they had like A-B-N-C and nobody knew which one was. And they almost all of them picked B, which was Burger King. Huh. I fired away far and away to the best coffee and then McDonald's was also Dunkin Donuts. They all like Burger King the best. How do you like that? In terms of the deal which is expected to close the string we're not just those that deals be seen to prove that in principle from Pizza Hut the agreement is the latest in the series of acquisitions by private equity groups of fast food restaurants chains and PC is the world's largest pizza hot franchisee in curly operates 790 pizza restaurants and liver kitchens in 26th, across America and of course all around the world man everywhere you go there's pizza everywhere just everywhere there's regular pizza there's pizza to express Amsterdam Berlin Frankfurt Paris Unayment. I mean of course you got you know your Mickey D's and all those two but I mean pizza hot. I mean everywhere. Not to mention it currently and that's a full food chicken place. Here's a facts how oh yeah that a here is an A-all my yeah this facts Paris Milton my ass. There was a lot of polarity there is that effect. I think you're probably heard so that you're asked the very close call. Yeah I got news for my ass lots of life at inchutas. I'll take your word for it even on a day for Royde should pop. No I won't actually we can put it on or because look at what the question is that's we didn't say we didn't assume that these people have good taste. That's always the thing when you most desire you put Paris Milton on there just for Yuck's right. I think maybe wine Mike might go for that just for a look out there for Yuck's. Yeah look out. You know I don't want to like I want to say this delicately but you know I'm always vision about these really smelly nasty gross people like it would be on in various places. Mostly certain kind of I don't want to say like Russian and all that next Easter block. But you know most of these people are married to somebody you know I'm growing with this. Yes I do and I think to myself these people are laying down in the same bed with other people. That's right and they look like this and they smell like this and they like have and see you know Barra sop for a thing a body worship about I mean. You know what I'm saying? Yes I do they're probably very to a similar pig. I see because otherwise maybe it explains the ration to the sides in the world you know that might be a horrible thing. You know maybe maybe like 40-50 years ago the other person the smelly nasty gross person was like very attractive whenever you're young and very you know maybe even whatever had good hygiene. But all of a sudden it's turned away disgusting smelly nasty crunchy pig. Man. I just like to have to lie down to something like that. Don't they you? They're like that. Night after night. They after day. Get up in the morning with that morning breath that's stenched at wonderful aroma. See maybe it's just not so bad after all of a day. This is you know you're right. Look at that little self. This is 5.16. You understand the stop-out in the track of every while. If anybody has a opinion. Desenting from or away. Your facial name and food has been stopped.

Police will call firemen work for public to a man being Trump's face and it's doing we never call on a streetplace The high-top corner got the yard said she was arrested on suspicion of the possession of control substances. He was taken to a central London police station. Who wants to admit it with the sky? A pop-pad room in July and the cops. Yes, they recognize me. It's been a few years now, it doesn't surprise me. So we got a sleeping hide-away. I was Trump in my own office. Now I know what a fool I've been. I sure could use another hit strong again. Cause the fast Christmas, if baby's so cracked, but the very next day, I won't be the way. I'm queer, I have no to live. I'm a 32 at 5.60, WDQAM, GOP lawmakers worked to limit probe of domestic spine program. Republicans in Congress are trying to limit the scope of any investigation. And how President Bush's secret domestic surveillance program is operated. Some key lawmakers also are working to legalize such spying on US citizens in the future. Perhaps with some judicial restrictions, let me read that sentence again. Some key lawmakers are also working to legalize such spying on US citizens in the future. Perhaps with some judicial restrictions, or perhaps not. Yeah, right. Perhaps. The dual track effort is designed to protect the Bush administration from an all-out congressional in-parwin of the secret program. While rejecting Bush's argument that the already has fully equal authority to order such surveillance. The Senate Intelligence Committee scheduled a vote today on a democratic plan to conduct a broad investigation of the program. The committee chairman Pet Roberts, your Republican of Kansas, a real Yahoo, is trying to win support for a more limited inquiry. Roberts refuses to say yes to the way that we had the votes to force all the democratic demand for investigation. Democrats need only one Republican decide who orders such a probe of the vote. That's that Doug Thompson thing, man. That's, uh, her scary stuff. Of the scary stuff. How dare he write anything about the unmentioned of an act? Right. In that unmentionedable website. Speaking of unmentionedable is Walmart. Walmart and with bloggers in a PR campaign. This is, this is so, this is almost a fact of to me in spite of all the money to make an obedience. And this is actually desperation. Yeah. Because Moe and Moe are people are getting out of them and Moe and Moe are more communities are saying, Hey, guess what? We don't want you here. You can't build one here. Go find some slave labor somewhere else like an India. Brian Picker laid blog or recently posted note on his website at Tech East State Legislation. I would force Walmart's stores to spend more and employ health insurance. All across the country newspaper editorial boards, no great friends of business are ripping the bills he wrote. It was the kind of pro Walmart comment that John Retailer might write itself in. In fact, it did. Huh. Several sentences in Mr. Picker's January 20 posting others from different days are identical to those written by an employee that one of Walmart's pubic relations firms and distributed by email to bloggers. Under the saw does never be for. All right. Walmart is increasing the level of the human being on the mainstream. Me being working directly with bloggers, feeding them exclusive nuggets of news, suggesting topics for postings, even inviting them to visit its corporate headquarters. Kind of like the way the Fudge Report operates. You know, we get to call from Richard Melon Schaif and some of those operatives, those right wing fanatics. And by the beat, but it will be put on it whatever they, you know, they just put the words in his mouth. And boy, you talk about getting crowded. But the strategy raises questions about what bloggers who pride themselves in independence to this close to readers. Walmart, Fination's largest private employer has been forthright with bloggers about the origins of its communications. And the company has public relations firms, Edelman, say they did not compensate the blogger. But some bloggers have posted information from Walmart at times, word for word without revealing where it came from. Glenn Reynolds, the founder of instepunded.com, one of the oldest blogs on the web, Wayne at the wicked web, said that even the blogger's career, which has been on for its lack of rules, a basic tenor deploys. If I reprint something, I say where it came from, a blogger's about your voice, it seems to me that somebody else's. Companies of all striped shows you using blog self-shaped public opinion. Before a general elector can ask the major investment energy efficient technology last year, company executive's first met with major environmentalist. The bill support. Others have reached down to bloggers from all day, product for services Microsoft, with his ex-box game system. By the way, they don't work. And singular wireless is down to the introduction of an ebook on it. That was so choice, man. All those people that were beat each other over the head and going crazy and line them up at Tia Clock at a morning. And they thought they were an expound they said, well, it doesn't work. But what's given about Walmart's approach to bloggers, they rather than promoting a product, something it does quite well, given it's $200 billion annual sales, it's trying to improve its battered image. Walmart long criticized for low wages and its health benefits began working with bloggers in late 2005, as part of an overall effort to sell our stories, said, Mona Williams, a company's spokeswoman. As more and more Americans go to the Internet to get information from varied, credible, trusted sources, Walmart is committed to participating in that online conversation, she said. That goes on. They're just, you know, trying to see the first propaganda. So careful what you read on the web, just trust this stuff you read on our website. That's it. That's right. All the rest is proper gander. All I do like that raw story, man. That's excellent. It's pretty raw. If you realize we got 914 votes already, I do. And there's a dumb person that did you talk about TV? Oh, there he is. Oh, no, thank God, it's not live. But that's right here. They were a user force to one to fly to Texas because he had a cast that vote in that time that's got like 40 votes in it. He might be the deciding vote. So we can't afford any DCR that you see on the NBC News outside all those mobile homes that are sinking into the ground. Yep. Yep. All these poor bastards from New Orleans, man, are homeless. And yesterday they started, you know, the demolition of those homes and the tearing of houses down. All the other crap and we got people at desperate to find a life, you know? I have no life. But we got thousands and thousands of mobile homes sitting sinking in the ground in Texas and we're obviously able to have our consulate. But think of food. Yeah. They're thinking over there. Ask you, Gordon, weaver would say nice trailer. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 the Verizon singular ride of the line. W to Q a m. Hello. Hey, good morning, new. Yes sir. Sandra Bullock on that list, please. Okay. And today's my birthday. Really? And she has such a small part in crash. And he was still great movie. She had a pretty small part. And for my birthday, could you do me one small favor? Me, possibly. And a moment now see here. I love it. I'm in the strip on positive. The funniest man between 10 and 2. Oh, no. Oh, no. See here. There actually is a good call. I mean, I remember the other. Yeah. It was about to be a series too, you know. Yeah. It was got fuck. It's still be a series. There's always the stop now. Now see here. His memory lingers on. Oh, do do do do do do. And he roamed that must read in the bag. How many of you weigh in? Hello. Hey, Neil. I got a couple of people for your list on the pictures list. They got a pattern of thanks. And then on the list of 40 folks, we got a original Martinez Jackson. Reggie Jackson, 44. My gosh. How can I have? We got Floyd Little. Right. We have. Did you? Dan Morgan. Who? Dan Morgan when he was a linebacker at the U or 44. Wow. Are you? I need this. That's not my U. And then of course, the world renowned chair at New Park when he was a Duke. Okay. Put your head. Oh, yeah. Although it is my university. We love their hurricanes. Went on Thursday. Please. Oh, yeah. Knock off. Pumps in man. Pumps is not that great. That's what we were told. They're marginal. Kings have a shot to win a game. We got a shot man. They give me Johnsonwood say we got a shot. Because if the Kings win a game, then they play again on Friday morning at the same time. So it's possible I could have a really soft week. You know, and my age is probably going to get used to it. Go to the soft food. Dennis tomorrow. That's not a soft deal. To be honest with that, rather worth it to our 50 minutes tomorrow, they go to the Dennis. Yeah. That's a good perk. Although I'm thinking I'm going to get drilled. But I'm going to get, uh, I don't know what, I don't know. I'm going to get creed. What are you going to get ground? Ground and crown and ground. I'm going to ground. I'm going to get coffee. Yeah. Well, they got to do coffee. I saw the side out there that they're called at something. One of the talking heads, I think it was a, uh, what's your name? Soly dead. I think she was saying how tasted like it. I know one of them was saying it tasted like it had something in it. Yeah. Who else? No, not a good careful. Careful. We love that burger king. Right. I love that best, huh? We like everybody who's in prison is on two. If you got somebody, we want it. Just like when you go into wood by man, you've got some cash. We'll take it. We don't care if they have to weed you in with 14 oxygen tanks and some of the, too. I still can't get over that. You think that's what I handed my future. Can you just envision that? But wheelchair oxygen is a hick right there. Part of the slot machine? Yeah. Yeah. I can see it now. Bag. You know, with the, uh, chair. And the nose. The electric wheelchair, of course. And the bathroom inside of my electric wheelchair. It's open around from one good machine to another one. I think that's it. And if that's what my future holds, I think that's the best idea. I'm going hunting with Dick Taylor. There he goes. He's me, Roger. This is five, six, two, one, four. I'm sorry. Our David's a fit. Okay. Now what's the moment that I was supposed to play? Because I got distracted by something on the internet. I wasn't. Now see here. Oh, now see here. Well, we're going to, I'm not going to find that. And keep in with the high standards of broadcasters. In the tradition of Edward Omar O. Sing it now. Five, six, E, W, Q, A, and recess. Now see here. With no Howard David. I just want to know. I'll say here. I don't know. Bigger. And if I can so choose to stay, I will change the face of whatever that is to. Now see here. Who did more for radio? Neharogis? Oh, hey, Oscar Anderson. Yeah. I say, we must go and listen. That's who. But one thing, he was the mayor of boarding radio. And at night smoke a he ain't no man. Why, you're a Hoyb Oscar Anderson saying nice song. Oh, he had a, You know, I think you're listening. And you're not even single songs about not an inmate. We're with it. Oh, no, no, no. I sure that there that's a nail singing that is very rich in songs about they go with the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the. And then a back of the one and he writes in it and it neal sings them. Now you know he's queer because real men don't sing. Oh, and another, he was a radio. But a lot better than the old two that they have will make them their best. And the next one of them, how see here, who made a better cup of coffee? This is old city or Jackie Robinson and I, Now see me here next time for a mowing ignorance on, How see here, not there over here. And I heard it was Burger King. Now he misses oldson. 560, 560 pound, 560 of the Verizon Sea to wireless lines. And don't forget to am fan, noon to two, Sheldon station, Courtney University in the Broward Boulevard.

Two pieces of good news though while you are filling your fat faces. Speaking of McCalli Cookin, did we hear that name in a minute? A little seconds ago. Mirror moments. Chameless Cookin is sulking. A very strong McCalli Cookin says he is struggling to find work as a grown-up actor and he barely talks to pal Michael Jackson. I don't know what people want from me. Cookin 25. Boohoo's in Time magazine. The most out of work actor I know. Which we say. Excellent. The home alone starts biggest reason. We are always in a real life courtroom when he testified as a character. We are in a nice year for Jacko who is getting free on his child molestation charges. Because in an late they can't convict anybody. Cookin who still is his pal and slimmer he did in his heyday as me as he has talked to only while he was the Jackson since the pop star fled to the Middle East after his acquittal to Moshrain. He is a friend of the kind of friend you talked to twice a year Cookin said. But little work in Hollywood Cookin has written a semi-autobiographical novel Jr which is due to come out like this this month. Oh my god. Jr. Who am I Jr. honey? Wow. Cookin was dating in 170 Shilakras Milakkunas. Do you know who that is? Yes. What does she look like? The little brunette not the redhead. So she's like watch that show. You watched it long enough to notice that feathers of screaming faggot. Right and that. Well, Cookin who is on him is getting up there. There you go. There are two girls. She saw that part right. She's the brunette. And it's in charge. I didn't. Well that makes sense. Well but is she cute? Yes. And she's dating him? What do you know? Oh my god. McCallie Salkin. Admitted Sputtyman career in the stream of consciousness told him of my spark even more whispers about him. What does that mean? I've let a very isolated existence that was six. He said it's kind of been me and my mind. I hope people won't think I'm crazy because I'm not. Maybe it was all that did with embedded Michael. Maybe that's what like affected his mind. Or something that rhymes with mind like B. Well. Oh, I hear some more good news. So we don't have no reports from Miguel. We just got 250. Well, let's start and then move up a little bit. It's not spectacular but surely. Well, slowly but surely. So that's don't call me surely. 230, 1200, 230. We'll do a thousand a day. Okay. I think we can. You got a shot. I mean you've got to be there to a clock. Right. And then of course Josh has been in a real big number tonight at the Smokey Vones. I mean, Bernie Cosa stay cause. Aren't you going to do at least four or five hundred? Oh yeah. Well, why do you say it like that? The crowd shows up for those deals every week. You know, no, I don't know. If I would be the silent dining crowd. Of course we have a broadcast going on in there. Right. Sports crowd. I would imagine. What's the nice place? And I was the hurricane crowd. Was it certainly not my people. Oh God. Hate me like poison. You won't do 40 bucks. You want to go back to Smokey Joe Bones again. Why did you give me into this? That's all I would like. Why did I get you in the second and the first place? Has it? I drag my heels at heart until they don't like it. All right. Oh my God. And I told everyone who was approaching me with the desire to do something. You know, I said, Leave me out of it. No, no, no. No, no. No, no. I have to go down this path. Leave me out of it. I don't need to go through another fake. I have a vision. It's a lot of it. And it's not really interesting listening for people listening to hear me begging and pleading and squeezing and controlling and trying to get somebody to show up and give us some money. Which they just don't care. It's a cheap ass place. It always has been always will be. And you know, they got us all whipped up with the phony enthusiasm. And they're because of that 30th anniversary thing last week for the last of the couple of days. And now you see all the way around. It's like, you know, that's it. I don't look for us anymore because we shut our deal. And that's it. Forget about it. Anyway, here's the other good news while you're eating. And you just enjoy lunch. Still worry about it. We'll do the best we can. It's all we can do. It's exactly how to do the best we can. You know, I mean, what else is new? So the calls suck and all of us, and they've reduced to a very, the internet, the website on the other hand is going crazy. So it goes to show you. It's the end of the egg. Not everything is going to be sensational. Last few days, for whatever reason, the website just going nuts. Maybe they're all reading a loose change on their parts one and two. You think that could be and what you're all to. Because they're sure not on their given money to obtain the per rescue by the Syrians. That's for damn sure. That's for damn sure. Paris circling the wagons consultant says, send hopeful cancels weak in the parent. Oze planes, if playing, Catherine Harris, she's indeed due to, baby. It's up to where arm pits. I already tried to avoid the media long bokeh Republican Catherine Harris is now canceling campaigns stops in the Southwest Florida as questions swim. About her ties to Washington, DC Defense Contractor, the Center of an ongoing National Brewery scandal. Harris was running for the US Senate abruptly canceled the stop in Charlotte County on Saturday and for other events, planned for Lee and Carter Countries were moved from her campaign website. It's another standard Harris's drug and campaign is now in full crisis mode. Political consultants say that, char, and see, actually that's bad news. Because I'd love her to be the Republican candidate, but unfortunately, don't look that way. She could make the beat her without even showing up. Yeah. Political consultants say that char, away from the public right now is a bad strategy. She can't hide and expect this to go away, said David Johnson, a Republican political consultant, or psych or campaign is circling the wagons. Branded based political consultant, Mark Procter, that's branded where Josh used to live. Mark Procter, who's a proctorologist, said he advises fans to hold court early with the media to avoid a straight drag none for weakness and as with Harris, the longer the story goes on, the more likely it is for voters to remember the issue come election day he said. The company's owner admitted in the federal court, MZM, that he gave thirty two thousand dollars in legal campaign donations to Harris, what we had that story of today. But there's the good news, okay, can't throw Harris' phone on hard. And wait till she gets on that plane again. Look out. Just like Joyce, you know, next time you start your car, Joyce, I'd be real careful. 560, 0560, palm 560, the riseman's singular wireless line. 250, my ass, 12,234, see with me, it's not one of those things where I can just like, ignore it, you know.

I just thought out of a meeting, so if you already heard about this, I apologize. But I have a little fire report. You're a nominal, I'm there. I get the very nominal competition. It rose and birds. I don't know if you heard he called into the Roddenk Fend Show yesterday on XM. Yeah. And it was pretty funny. He was a dinging rod, ding ding for a five thousand dollar loan. Dang he had to work for a 75 and a grilled cheese sandwich down here in Miami. And basically we're voting his back that he was stuck down here, that he was begging for a gig on XM. I have a copy of it as an MP3 file if you guys want it. I don't want to get depressed. Okay, I'm just pretty funny. And Benny's been in Furned later that he wasn't going to make the loan because it would wind up, wind up, did it go? Let me just put it that way. So a bearish and he's true. Okay, guys, I'm going to know his family. All poor, sir. He won't be around too long. Sid the kid. You know, he, I am sure he realizes what the sign of the street he's on is not this side. That really put them over the top, didn't it? Oh yeah. 560, 50560, pound five60, and he's right. You know what I'm going to do from now on? I don't have a point to this. And it was my bad. This list was from what the hell was it again? Askman.com. All I had to do and I didn't see that. I missed that because they only listed this story. They only listed the top 10. So I used those top 10. I had a few of my own and you added a couple. Right. And that's what we started with. And then we're letting these people call in with it again. Building the pole with stupid ass names. All I had to do was click the askman. I'm going to have the top 100. And I could have an error can paste and cut and slap and squeeze and could have done that. And then we went out of waste time with this. You have to do what the color is called up about. Oh, there wouldn't be any. 18 to 1 at 560, but you see, you're starting to get the drift to where I'm going. I know. It's just, it's just the whole thing, you know. Just amazing. It's how for it. I keep forgetting. You know, how to outside out of mind out of touch. Like Tom Jick would say. Out of touch. And my response time is, touch this. Hey, y'all know the name by now, Drag Concepts.

Wait, did you hear this? You know, Americans ought to be riding. What are they worried about? They're worried about it. It's hard out there for a pimple. Back to, oh, no, listen up. I like it. Oh, yeah. Next time. That's how contract you're based in Dubai. It's look good of US security contracts from a roster in Oless. A British security firm headquartered in Dubai has a look at a contracts where US security in Iraq and the United States providing security in the wake of hurricane Katrina and training Iraqi port security officers under the Coalition for Visual Authority. Roscoe has founded the firm the Olive Group. Well, I wonder if they're kind of the Olive Garden. It's largely comprised of expeditions held in offices. A lot of British companies, it's main headquarters are in Dubai. The United Arab Emirates city that caused a stir when it was revealed that the Emirates were set to take over control 21 US ports. Olive was founded in 2001. The revelation that a Dubai based firm provides security consulting for Mary at US operations at home at a broad chose the increasing tendency of US Government to privatize security efforts. It comes on the same day that the Fudging Board discovered that a forward company had a secret in Indianapolis airport. Oh, yeah. Let's not have the ragheads. Handle security to airport. The Fudging Board. I think they're like that. Oh, he's going to get a flashing. I guarantee you that. I'll talk to you. I want to be the first one. $400.

Maybe I'll make that thousand for you tomorrow. Would buy. All right. Put it in the long for open center. Why don't I know? I just don't put your losers in there. No, I'm going to put, uh, I'm just going to send you an empty envelope and you can reimburse me from my with. Yeah. I'll just consult again to rack you's underwritten my US tax payers under an umbrella contractor awarded to. Backtale. Oh, my God. It is one three major contracts from backtales since the invasion in 2003. A recent estimate suggests the US spends $2 billion a year on private security services in Iraq. All of a score at least 100 million when the study was published in 2004. All came under scrutiny in 2003 after it emerged that the co-owner is fathered Tony Alham visited Washington meet with backtale. He visits the non-boy of Iraq industry working group and armoured the British government. Alham and his son tonight in the contracts of order due to favoritism. Right. Right. Under another US backtale deal, all are provided security and Mississippi for travel trails and mobile homes in the wake of Katrina. Ross Dorey has found the firm also provided training for guards and guard your efforts. The Iraq port authority, the IPA, has approximately 130 Iraqis local and occupied security positions at the port, a 2004 press release from the coalition provision authority declared. And Kuzan Yadiya, one Azov. All of your money man has been siphoned at the same bunch of crooks, the same bunch of folks who are in bed with Bush and Cheney and all of these in Bush one. All of these gangs this. The international end and public is just sitting back. What about that? It's good. Because you know it's hard out there for a pimple. Great a lot of this week of play. I always ran after this weekend. It was on the first week. When they played that. Okay. Yeah. That's about as hard as the week. Right from the get go. 119 votes on the pool were kicking ass on the pool. We got 400 out there. That's not so bad. Why are you getting a wise just getting a salty press about that? I don't know. Because he just wants to do well all the time. Is that what it is? That's exactly what it is. That's what it is. Well, in that fact, the case in you better come up with least 400 bucks tonight or whether it the Bernie Cossacks is a smoky bone. Better than me. I got a check. I already did. I guess it's check on you. I got a yesterday. I didn't hear no thank you. Oh, I thank you. Jack. Yes. What? Yeah. You see this? This. You were in the moron. It's so kind of. It's okay. That's right.

That's, said. Now, only, Watson's got one. Pam Greer, one, evil, a rule one. Molly Ringwald and Michelle Rodriguez, and rightfully so both of them got the big. Wow. Do I have time to read the set of 12 from the New York Times, Mr. Bush's Asian growth for how long? Yeah, do. All right, short. And it's real from today's New York Times. There's a lot of good a president can do one of his into another country, negotiate treaties and enhance American security. Sure, I appreciate he alliance. Janet Ray could will and important parts of the world. Unfortunately, President Bush didn't do any of those good things and he's just completed a visit to Pakistan and India and may have done some real harm. The spectacularly misconceived tip may have inflicted serious damage to American goals in two vital areas. Namely, mobilizing international diplomacy against the spread of nuclear weapons and encouraging Pakistan to take more effective action against the Taliban and I'll try to fight his operating from its territory. The nuclear deal at Mr. Bush concluded within the Ascredence to blast a bomb-sized loophole to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It would have been bad enough on its own and disaster-yield time because it undercuts some of the most powerful arguments Washington can make to try to galvanize international opposition to Iran's nuclear adventurism. But the most immediate damage was done on Mr. Bush's next Pakistan. Washington is trying to persuade General Pervert Mushir, if the Pakistani military dictator, to define nationalist and Islamic objections and move more aggressively against Pakistani-based terrorist. This is no small issue because both Osama, Yamama and the Taliban leader, Mullah Bullah Omar, are not believed to operate from Pakistanis soil. But, sticking with Mushir for the unwelcome task of explaining the Pakistanis while his friend and ally Mr. Bush had waited favorable nuclear terms to Pakistan's archrival India, while withholding them from Pakistan left him less likely to do Washington any special and politically unpopular favors on the terrorism front. It's just baffling while Mr. Bush traveled halfway around the world to stand right next to one of his most important allies against terrorist and embarrass him. Indian Pakistan are military rivals that are fought each other repeatedly. They hit each other like poison. They both developed nuclear weapons outside the non-proliferation treaty which both refused to sign. When India exploded its first acknowledged nuclear weapon eight years ago, Pakistan felt obliged to follow suit within weeks. So, at Mr. Bush agreed to carve out an exception to global non-proliferation rules for India. It should have been obvious that Pakistani, if Indian would demand the same privilege treatment, and then Mr. Mushir would be embarrassed by Mr. Bush's explicit refusal to provide it. Most of Bush was right to say, no to Pakistan, or beyond thinkably bad idea to grant loophole to a country who's top nuclear scientist help transfer nuclear technology leading rogue states, granting India loophole that damages a vital treaty and lets New Delhi and celebrate production of nuclear bombs makes no sense either. Mr. Bush should adjust state home, but you know something, then we never would have those mangoes. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62. And this is the end. This is not a Tuma. It's the one to two hour. What? Did it clear the same thing? The truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the truth is that the unit is that assassHS just smear it. Now what he said he just smear it. That's why he kept cream in the ball. I'm sure he was. He was smearin' that creamy to want to say where. Back home. Yeah. steroids. Oh, there's your girlfriend. Cross-room based cure of Phillips Rots. I don't know. I'd like to get our old baseball bat with a rusty man. Called for the restarting of cycles when he felt his energy and power start to drop. If Anderson, his trainer told bonds, he was not due for another cycle. The authors write bones or bonds rather than. He's not going to go on SACES medicine. But it sounds like gray bones. So what we're reading and seeing this was a hard core addiction. That's true. I mean, according to the reporting by the office. There's time for a duty. He's going to be able to do to your sports or a stroke. The answer is drugs. The authors name at least 10 different substances that bonds us use. And as you mentioned, in varying degrees and varying form. Some he injected himself according to the author's. Some injected flight his trainer according to the author's and oh my gosh, some and pill form which would form and lotion form cream form. Aha. Did you hear that? Or the in lotion form. That's where he been waiting to hear. That's the important part. Very. It puts the lotion in the basket. Right. Then the important thing. We got five bills. Oh, here you go. See? So in other words, we're halfway home. We need another 500 by another clock. We got another hour to go. And of course, now we got some momentum. We got 12,000 505. I want to at least get to 13,000 by two o'clock because then unreasonable expectation. Yeah. It is. I thought you said a thousand earlier. Now I'm not talking about phenomenal. Total. Total. All right. For the total. And it's hard to talk over here. That's another 495 bucks. We need that. Let's see. Here's the facts from Russ who was so chronic. Let's see. Where are all the gorgeous Russian athletes? He cut a point surprised the anocornal hoarders. Not let's get around. Or right away. Look, they're not on her. Because nobody's calling in and saying a net. Right Russ. That's what you're there for. And we haven't had enough calls here to fill a T-cup with. Okay. God. Also Maria Sharapova come on. I saw her day of the day for about four seconds. She's me as. He says he's no add-up, but I'll take her. Maria Sharapova. And that's the one he wants to most. Russ. Okay. Here we have her put around here. Maria Ianacornal hoarder. Maria Sharapova. Now, now, I'm thinking of Lesbians. I mean, Frederick Merlin, Hood Colleges reviewing a Tom coming rolls after a Lesbian was crowned King. A college official said, Oh my God. This is kind of like a, that was, that was special. I thought we had like an echo. I could be going to a like, well, I'll have to wait me. See, jingle. Okay. That's a her daughter. That's a her boss grinder. So, and that's she's. That was fantastic. I mean, that was a simultaneous of whatever. Great. Thanks a moment. Well, this is a twist on the usual thing where the guys want to be the homecoming queen right and I've known plenty of those. But this is the other way around. Jennifer Jones is the 21 year old senior who beat out three men for the honor of uh, uh, crowner King, crowned King. Said the crowning was a positive step for the private liberal arts college, Hood College, and she didn't even live in the hood. It is cool that her to last people to beat themselves. Jones told a Frederick News post, Frederick Merlin, and people want me to be king that would eliminate it, mean voted for me. And then she'll tell you they got a clip on here on CNN. Why it's good to be the king. You know what I'm saying? Uh, not that king. Oh, Joseph, Newark Delaware received 64 or 169 votes cast for King last month. More than two weeks after Jones was crowned, criticism and praise were still ripping through the 2100 student campus in western Maryland. She's not a man said singled in Newman. A 22 year old senior was nominated for Queen. It's a gender issue and she's a woman. Sorry. Yes. San Jo for Lanzano. I wonder if he's Kim de Pat for Lanzano from Bob Paparo from Batavia Downs. San Jo for Lanzano 21 to compete for the king said Jones selection made the event seem like a joke. If the scoreage is guys from mine to take part in the future, he said. Donald Miller, Hood student activities director said, all of whom coming eventually, we've even possibly changed. We're looking at what students want Hood's home coming to be, he said. There's only the second annual home coming for the school. Men started attending Hood and 71 but the school didn't become fully co-ed until 2003. But men were first permitted to live on campus for the first time. Jones tried to run for homecoming Prince last year, but a student committee wouldn't let her on a ballot. Even though she had gathered the required number of signatures on nominee petitions. Miller said it all changed this year, but the participants have required the candidates be nominated by student ballots. While guaranteeing that Jennifer is more manly than most of those wimpy guys on ed campus, when you think I'm sure. A man's not a member of the Federal Special Persuasion. A masculine child. Anyway, we got so we have 500, huh? Yes, pretty disappointing when you come right down. But I'm just naive. I'm just stupid. That's my problem. Just like Moe used to say, stupid. You, me, Jack Ross, stupid. A lot of this. Dominic, you, way, I'm, hello. I'm your senior. I'm good, Neil. Yes, sir. I did. I can get to my radio, sir. I can graduate from 30 years, I don't know how to do it. I'm in. Great. Great. I love you, man. I guess you probably, not as Dick was in town yesterday. Yes. And they shut down 95 and all the action should not be put on and off. And they have done that before you. You know, they do it all the time. They do when 10 years to come in, when Bush comes in, come out, did they do that all the same? I don't know. Why is he asking me something like that? When anybody important, like when Alfredi Newman, I mean, Bush Jr comes in. Anybody. When your fan asks, Governor comes in. I don't know if they do it for him, do they? I don't know what they do. I don't know what they do. I think they had a rule out the barrel. I think he ought to go for Niagara Falls in it. Rule out the barrel for fat ass jab, a real gangster in Crook of the Ever was one with a dysfunctional family. How about that story, by the way, about Neil Bush getting funding for that this school-scam program he's got going from the UAE, or the UAE, G. I'm so surprised. Yeah. What a revelation, huh? Even in the Bible, right, in the revelations like that, birds of a feather are quirks together, make no mistake about it. And of course, this is a $7 billion deal of messing with, so one day your president didn't know what he was about it. And then the next day he's threatening to veto if anybody tries to block it. How do you list it up all my way? Yeah. He sure is a quick learn, Rene. He's a quick study. My God. We're going to have lung cancer kills more than the breast cancer, and poor dinner reached in every even smoke. He was not a smoker. How about you said, second hand, smoke? And what I thought about it was, as you can see, no one had a agraphone. Oh yeah. Love that place, but man, I can't wait to leave. Stop, but they stopped a smoker in there. Oh, brother. All you phagic smokers on it, they're all, why do you have to keep blowing a smoker in everybody else's face? And I don't want to even, but they, when they're just holding it, when they're not popping on it, and they're cigarette too. Oh yeah. They always leave it at that angle. You don't say that. And they watch. They watch it. They're watching. Just to make sure that smoke is whafing up right in your face. Right in your eye. Yeah, your eyes are burning, man. It's burning. You're tearing up. Anyway, that's probably because you're losing your ass. Good woman, you've also sat here. We got a horse race going. I think it might even be a four way, which I'm sure you'd like to see that. It 1159, votes Jessica Alva, 165, Halley, Barry 140, and Angelina, Julie 134, Charlize, they're all one online. Who wouldn't want to see that? Scarlett Johansson, 97. He's starting to make her move. No, I'm a straight female 58%, five percent even. That is a blessing. A blessing. Natalie Portman 51, none, I'm gay 46.9. Evil, I'm Gloria 45. I hate this pull 44. Britney Spears 40. And now there's not interest you that the game meals will make you point nine percent of the audience. Well, like I said, when you take those polls before, they come up to about 10 percent or more. But I think that instead of choosing that option, they're actually voting for something. No, no, the question is what woman do you most desire? Game meals desire these women get out of here. We're not asking who's the most beautiful. Don't you understand that? Who is there? Who do you want to get it on with, baby? Who do you want to wake up in the morning next to? Sniffin, we desire. Yeah. Anyway, I hate this pull. It's got 44. Or maybe somebody, yeah, even on Gloria 45, I hate this pull 44. Britney Spears 40. 40 guys still, they would still overlook all the other crap. Jessica Biel 38, Adriana Lima, for a disc of her good shower. Oh, and I noticed that dial is now advertising the new men's body wash that's like real manly and yani yani yani yani. And they show a bar soap nest to a dial for men, but then it's the valve body wash for men. Or trying to get to the crowd of you pansies out there. We still are too insecure to know. Nobody uses soap, no more. Don't you get it? Nobody uses soap unless they want to drop it. Jessica Biel 38, and we had a lot of 27 Jennifer Carly, 24 Pamela Anderson, 15. Some a high act 14. Jennifer's name is only 14 of that shocking. Or maybe the reason they don't want her is because they feel she's well used well worn. Say the least. Yeah. Jessica Simpson 12, Maria Manuno 12, Sandra Bullock, for Sandra. She fell down in stairs. Oh, and by the way, if I can just say it, why is this that called before the flight was very clever? I never said that I like crashes much as Magnolia. Reminiscent, the story and the style of the way that movie was done. It was reminiscent of Magnolia. I never said it was as good as Magnolia. I liked it as much as Magnolia, which I don't. Magnolia is like a classic. It's a masterpiece. Crash is very good, but I don't put it in that category. You do obviously. Yeah, I don't think it's a masterpiece. Oh, and Magnolia. Well, I did. Huh? I'll just short. Sorry. I think it's all about two frauds. Sure. Okay. Yeah. We need more frauds. Paris, holding nine. She's having Sandra Bullock. I mean, that's pretty sad. Sandra oughta be peoed about that. See in a Miller 8, Shakira 7. I keep forgetting to play my Shakira stuff. Vita Gannon has got five Jennifer Tilly four, Tira Bangs four. Just Elvunchen, God four. Terry Hatcher three. Who else? Pam Greer three, give her a union two. Michelle five for two. Amore two. I thought that's something that you have that motor world. We said that. Yeah, Emily. Janet Jackson once we know where you am is one. Jillian Barbrae one. Naomi Watts one. Eva LaRue one. And none for Maria Sharifov who we just put around her. Anna Cornohoyia. Jen for Iniston. Molly Ringwald. And Michelle Rodriguez. Molly Ringwald had to be a joke. Isn't it? Yeah, I'm sure. She's actually a ringworm. No. Or it's a very least ring around a con just a gender. I see. Who am I thinking of? That's married to not Patrick Swaysey. Kurt Russell. What about him? Who's married to Kurt Russell? Goldie Hard. Goldie Han. That's one thing I know. I'm not saying that guys want Goldie Han. I'm glad. She's a little long in the tooth. Take her over her daughter though. Who's your daughter? Kate Hudson. Are you picking on for Kate Hudson? I am. Yes. No. For Adam. Come on. How about Kate Moss? Okay, even see her no more. Kate Hudson man. She's a member of the clan now Kate Hudson. She's a member of the group. She's in. She's been initiated. I don't think the way that some people are thinking. But she's been initiated. Well, that's too bad. 113 at 5. 60 WQA. You're fair. Each Ford is gone mad. It's madness in March and it's going on right now and all are in the month of March and beats for it. They just missed having a record month last month. So they kind of break that record this month. Right now, extended camp for 150s. There was lower 249 bucks a month. Would just 995 bucks down plus fees with a pro credit in 39 months. 995. In March, it beats Ford means you must be mad. You must be a crazy person. If you don't take advantage of rebates in discounts of up to $10,000 on all new and use vehicles. If you're not in the market for new carbon, know somebody who is sentiment to be for it. If they take delivery in March, beat Ford will send you 200 bucks in cash. That money comes from their advertising budget. So they're not going to jack up your friends price to get the 200 bucks back. Don't miss out on us once you event beats Ford mad this in March. Going on right as I speak. Extended camp for 150s is lower just 240 9 bucks a month. This counts in me rates up to 10 grand and 200 bucks in cash. Just for referring your friend set them on by. So hurry and beat Ford is too much. These are the golden glazed on 160 3rd Street West 60 highway. Here in teed, I'll bet your life on it. You'll love your beat Ford experience. Now the this is a new Rogers. This is 516. Oh. Where is Natalie? Kidnaff, Brown, murder. Tonight is the very first time you're hearing an in-depth account from the main suspect. You're on Vander's list. You were the last person to be with Natalie. And yes, doesn't put you in a good position. Maybe you know it's time to go to the police and tell them exactly what happened. Are you ready to tell the truth? Yeah. Something happened to her. Did you harm Natalie Holloway? Yes. What did you kill Natalie Holloway? Yes. I did it. Natalie. Natalie. It's gone. Why would you do that? The sexual predator and the f*** skull. When Brian talked continues. You remember the last time you saw her? Yeah, the last time I saw her, she was swimming with sharks. Yes. What I think? Like, yes, her clearance came running in here with these midday attend to three years. That was a great time. I accident. He brought her right over. Thanks, Clarence. And you see even though this is a precipitous drop, which we knew that QM got screwed all the way around. Just like all the other no-speakening ways to the stations. If reading out as bad as you think, no, explain how. Because that 27 you devil it and you subtract maybe two, three tens of a point. I've got like a five-sumper. Carry the one. Carry the one. And nobody by pie. It's not so bad. It could be worse. Not much, but it could be a little bit worse. Okay. Call of 40 and I hear something that everybody's going to sit up something that the whole audience can sink their teeth into. Call of 40 is Supreme Court rules on oral sex. Oh my God. Wait. Call of 40. Call of 40. Call of 40. Your jet system overturned state law requiring adults 21 years or older are convicted of having oral sex with 16 and 17 year olds to automatically register as a sex offender for life. They overturned that law. The California Supreme Court ruling, six to one, said the law first adopted in 1947, was unconstitutional. The majority said the law was too harsh around fear because adults 21 or older were convicted of having sex with minor's ages 16 and 17 are not automatically required to register as sex offenders. Just as this pointed out, the lawmakers declined to treat both categories of offenders equally three times in the last ten years. The court noted that because the law did not treat the two categories of sex offenders similarly, the law violated both state and federal equal protection rights. Mandatory lifetime registration of all persons who like to defend in here were convicted of voluntary oral compilation with a minor of the age of 16 or 17, but not of someone convicted of voluntary essential intercourse with a minor of the same age. Violates equal protection clause of the federal state constitutions just as Joyce can't agree with the majority. Joyce. That's the Joyce we need. Not the Joyce we got. I'd also have sex activity which children under 16 are required to register. The state maintains a valid database with personal information registered sex offenders that just as this is however left in tank of revision granting trial judges, the discretion to demand registration for both categories of ill sex offenders, those that have oral sex orender course with minor's ages 16 and 17. How you like that? I'm under federal argument, so I'm at. How we do not dare, by the way. Six hundred. Now we're plugging along, plugging along, 12,000, 605. We need number 395 and 40 minutes. It's unlikely I guess the way it's going. But if we do it about 100 bucks every 10 minutes. Oh, that's right. That would do it. Right. Maybe we'll get a big spurred all it was. I doubt it. I just don't think so. I don't have that feeling. Let's see. Monica Balucci. Bruce is. I would wake up. I would sell both nuts to wake up with her next to me on the. All right, here it goes. Monica Balucci. I got it. It's great. I got it. It's great. I was given the QM van right now from now till two o'clock, another 38 minutes at the corner of University driving, and probably really busy intersections in the. Broward County, one of the hubs of our audience in the South Florida. And so far we've got what 600. Yeah. Well, that's not like terrible. I mean, what you say, like you're going to commit suicide or something over. Not me. You think that's really bad? No, I think that's okay. We had a slow start. I have no idea why. That's why Miguel got their role. You're assuming they'd be lined up for miles for those. About 30. But it's a collector's item. Maybe we'll be somebody who has somebody to know. Sell him on eBay. That's right. Or not. And then, of course, the teacher is my god fantastic with those. I'll come in useful for. Car Shabby. Right. Thank you. Rectome. The 557. 05. 60. Everwise in singular. Wireless line. Terbin. No, be good. Be excellent. This is schmata for you. As a world as you know, you tell me the world is all about him here. It's the battle of the head year, man. Come in to QA and hello. Daniel, how are you doing today? Okay. Is one owner rider on the pole? Not yet. Okay. Well, if you could put her on, I would think, uh, one rider? But he said, yeah, definitely not one more question. Does anybody know what to do? Well, Russell Crowe was not nominated for that picture this year. I thought it was great. Cinderella, man, was Russell Crowe. Maybe they're tired of him already. I guess so, but it was a great movie. I saw twice. Really? That's an excellent movie. That's just a movie the year by far. Okay, thanks. Now, you think that, uh, Cinderella, man was Russell Crowe's the best movie of 2005. Did you see it? I did not. I did. And it's good. Not the best movie the year. I don't think it's better than crash. Oh, God. How could it be better than crash? Now, some of you comes out there. You're going to go out and you're going to get the crash. Are you just going to crash? And then you're going to say to us, oh, well, you guys were raving about it so much. And I thought it sucked. Well, I let this to, directly in for a dream. We had people say that. Look, if you don't think crash was a good movie, it would have won no for me. And you're in the very good point. To the same with the movie, anybody who thinks network wasn't good. Yeah, cut a puck. Yeah. I'm not a fan of the movie. I'm not a fan of the movie. I'm not a fan of the movie. Television is not the truth. So turn off your television, said, turn them off. Right in the middle of the shit. Ha ha ha. They showed that. I'm at a cell. They showed that during the interview. Yeah. They're the montage. Yeah. And every time I see it, it just is just a laughter fight. I don't know how many of that could fall asleep during that movie. Probably. I'm sure it's possible. Maybe he was toasted. Probably. I mean, what night was it? No. I definitely wasn't. You were not. So far as can be a should have been. Maybe maybe try next time. Arbiturated attention, fueling dire situation in Iraq, when an embassy international dire, D.I.R.E. dire. Tens of thousands of people have been held arbitrarily in Iraq since the start of the US invasion in March 2003, creating a situation that is right for abuse and the internationalists said. And I bet it smells pretty right for their too. Most of those held were either charged in our face trial had no basic rights to count their detention. The London-based human rights group said it launched a new report beyond Abu Ghara, raped the detention and torture in Iraq. Nearly three years after the US and Allied forces invaded Iraq in top of the government of Saddam Hussein, the human rights situation in the country-granes dire, it said. They're in dire straits. The deployment of US law forces in Iraq and the armed response that endangered that in gender has resulted in thousands of deaths of civilians and widespread abuses. A mythion going conflict. The report details what? And this decoled human rights violation for which the US-led multi-national forces directly be responsible, as well as those increasing recommended by Iraqi security forces. You know what I said security forces are out of control, you know what I said? Yes I did. For a while though. The record of those forces including US forces and their UK allies is an unpalatable one or like your delicious lunch from John DeBaker. It is unpalatable. Let me say it again. Unpalatable. It added since the invasion of Iraq and Marit, that's like guys that are fingerpainty. You want to know why? Because they got no palate. Oh that's bad. Would you rather have no palate or a cleft palate? Okay, they'll palate. It added since the invasion of Iraq and March 2003, tens of thousands of people been detained by, who was the other one of them? Okay, where it was Marlon Brando, it was her Lawrence Olivier. The other guy that was considered for rather godfather? Oh I know it would not have not heard us in forward. It's too long ago. Who know what? I don't know. Somebody very well known. Somebody famous. Somebody will call. And then Marlon put their fingers to take off. That was pretty fascinating. I had taped that earlier and there was nothing else on it. I saw the panthers lose and I saw a fully give a point of way to Montreal last night. You know I was suicidal about that. So I watched the Brando biography. I bet you, nobody in this audience realized I'm in a year's of I told you that he and his first, how do I say it is roommate when he went to acting school in the Yorker, and the young man was Walid Cox, Mr. Peepers. Well you told him that. And like they said in there isn't very unlikely duel, but they were pretty tight. Pretty tight those two. And when Walid died, Marlon Brando went to court to fight Walid Cox's mother to get Walid's ashes. And she finally gave up to fight because she assumed that based on his behavior, he needed them more than she did. He was like psychotic about it. They'd be one of the world's forehand. When he had croked, he had their ashes. It's still together. Yeah. Which is very much where we just talking about K. Edgar Hoover yesterday. And it's very interesting. Tulson, what does it mean? Clyde Bison. And when he died, they were now they weren't cremated. They were like buried side by each. Next week said, we were close. I thought they were buried above each other. Yeah, but the question is, who was on top of this? Edgar Hoover. Here we go. He'll Roger. That's him. This is 5.16. For the fact of station. This weekend on Access I was George Michael. You were busted over the weekend for drug possession, right? Yeah. What kind of shape were you in? Yeah. And what kind of drugs? The cops wanted to bring you down to the station. What did you say to them? So, in a sense, are guilty. And if you guys want to say anything else, you want to say? Uh, no thanks. I don't swing that way. Thanks for the interview. Gotta go. That's just weekend on Access Ily was. Thanks, Pat, by the way. Have another one. Bottom's up. 132 a QL we got post in. And by with 1218 votes. And out there with the fan, we got a big number. It's in coming. It's in coming. Now what we have on the last one. 600. 600. Well, we better be up to seven now. We're not going to make that 4,000 a day. The phone ring in here. So. Well, I mean, he's really busy. Maybe they're like backed up all the way up to Narendra. Let's pretend to know. Maybe they're backed up to goals. Yani faces domestic battery chart. I extrapolated between 10 and 2 and 2554, about a 63 in January. That's pretty good. Not so bad. It's at the right direction. Well, no, that's today. And again, keep in mind it's 10 to 2. Right.

Melissa Huff's mother found the legs in her unlocked car, which she had parked at Arcania High School. I once they afternoon. Nobody was seen in or around the car. Arcania police lieutenant can't harp her. There were no witnesses. We lifted some fingerprints. We'll see if there's any match. Huff's right leg was empty. Below the knee, after she was struck by a car two years ago. The first half happened in November first. When somebody cut a hole in a window, a screen, the house home in Stole. 12,000 dollar cosmetic leg. God, that's a lot to pay for a leg. Isn't it? Sure. Although for a doctorate, a number of delays, only a money for a new 16,000 dollar sports leg, which he uses to play softball on their Arcania High team. A sports leg, it has medic leg. You see them. And I have a feeling that we're on our last legs. The Stole leg was tossed in the family's backyard in January. But on Palantines, they said, somebody stole burklags.

How not going there in a moment? You know what I'm taking a go on again? Dig it up. To why? To why? To why? It's a long, long time. And of course, it's a long, schleppy. You know what? A really good trip like next summer. Not this year, but maybe next summer would be. Think about this. Bring it back to Maui. While we Toronto to Vegas for a day or two, and then over to Hawaii for about four days. And then back to Vegas for a day, two and then back here. Okay, so you were never going to Vegas again. Yeah, but don't understand. It's convenient. Right. I wouldn't go there again just by itself. In other words, just to make a special trip to Greta. Sure. But as a way of breaking up that very, because it's, I don't know. It's like about 10, 11 hours of flying to Honolulu. You're a bit of Hawaii? No. Drone? No. Why did you say it like that? Because it would cost money, and you don't either one of us has it. I mean, what kind of family did you have? They didn't take anywhere, like, especially, I mean, you know.

I'm telling you, it's it all, man. The Pacific Ocean is so beautiful. The Atlantic is schmutzman. It's just like, oh, dirty and, uh, and cold. The Pacific is warm and clean and pristine. Any why on the way? Why? Because Hawaii is like, there's not much else out there. You know, the Pacific is a huge ocean in there. And I'm, I'm a giant. As opposed to the Atlantic, at least our part, but you've got the floor done, a Caribbean, all those islands, all those turrets being drifted all over the Caribbean, all my life. I got like the caminile, my LA experience. I didn't see a bunch of a clean ocean. But that was a long time ago. I was talking to Hawaii. You've got 20 million people, uh, polluting that. Okay.

Means we need 235 bucks more in 15 minutes. Can we do it? We're getting right on the edge of it now. It's a tall order. You think? Yeah. We only did 80 bucks since that last one. So we're kind of like tear one off. We need 235 bucks between now and to a clock to get to even 13,000. There'll be a nice day. There will be almost a grand for today.

Anyway, uh, so we're at some to the audience. You got 14 minutes when you turn 35 bucks, which is what? Figured not 20 into 235. It's not hard man. Figured 240 is 12. 12. 12 deals. Or six. Six people with 40 bucks. That's more like it. Right? Or somebody really generates a one. That cares about the puppies. In fact, it's right next door to that fine plantation animal hospital. Right? When you think that a lot of people are picking up or dropping off their little dogs and cats, they would stop by over there at the shell gas station, gas up a little bit, and then see how they say how to make y'all. And throw them a few bucks. It would be the right thing to do. That would definitely be the right thing to do if you care about dogs or cats. I mean, even cats. Well, speaking of cats, Roy, so magazines, this match hit with the Chinese. What? The Chinese are the kids. The cats, man. They like to stick it up. Yeah, they're talking. They're trying up real good, little Chris Go. Hmm. Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck. Why do you think they love those sign-mees cats so much? Chinese readers bought nearly every copy of the inaugural edition of Rolling Stone and Beijing yesterday. On the cover of the first edition in Chinese of the American Bible of pop culture is Queen John. The godfather of Chinese rock and roll. Featuring the 44-year-old rock star was a bold choice. Queen only lasted timber play this first public concert in China in 12 years. Nearly 10,000 fans in the work of the stadium in Beijing. The magazine features J. Chow, a pop star from Taiwan, a J. Anigogo Japanese hip-hop artist, and Muzemi, a Chinese blogger famous for her sex diary, to round out its Asian input. More than half of the content is translated from the US edition. I'm telling you one thing about those Chinese that come in maybe repressive, but they sure. I say, hello, I guess I didn't get a lot of more than two children there now. That's what I heard, but maybe they changed that. I don't think so. I don't know. Gordon, two kids, about a bang. They should off your thing. Right. And opening at a tour of Rolling Stone says, today we're sending out a call to our readers. Let us join together in the Easter kid legend that will be worthy of this age. Whatever the hell that means. A legend. Sales have been brist since it hit the streets on Saturday. One magazine, Stahl Holder, said, I've sold out. That's more than 20 copies today. Maybe it's because of the free gift. And I think it's because people are quite interested to read this new magazine. I'm going to keep this as a souvenir. One day, it could be a collector's item said, Wayne Tongn, as he bought the stars last copy. That's you think that the Orioles could do it. Work a little bit on the names and also the Muslims. You know, I'm sure it's normal to there. Everybody, yeah, but everybody is named either Ahmed or Mohammed or a combination of Al-Vis, Al-Rosen, Al-Golstein, Al-Shore, Al-Sal. You know, Al-Salaman. I think you can see these names. A little name help. Everyone is named. I think you can see these names. A little name help. And everyone is well. Maybe Book of Brown could create something fancy for him. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Town 5, 60, and they've arisen in singular wireless lines. We take a couple of calls here. We're going to be shouting out. But that's because they were so good. And I want to get all I could stuff in there. Okay. WQAM, hello. Yeah. This sir. How are you doing? It's Wayne. The website you should probably check out is called inteach.org. Okay. I read about yesterday and Walsh, Journalists, an organization that's trying to create awareness. Oh, right. The impeachment of both President Bush and VP Cheney. And it's, you know, right now they're looking for funding. They also have sample letters that you can download. And, you know, basically just put your own name on them. Uh-huh. We're careful about that. Palli. Be careful about that. So what's up at the else's name on it? So if you get a chance, check it out. If you think it's worth plugging, then hopefully we'll hear more about it. Okay. I'll take a look at it. Thanks. Alrighty. I mean, I'm only half joking when I say that because I think people are going to be very and that's the whole idea to intimidate the public. Like all those little grandmas and grandpots, you know, they get together and they have their cookies. Like we saw in Fair and High 9 11, you know. And next thing, you know, the FBI is there. The CIA. They're all investigating and knocking on your door. They're conducting all kinds of, you know, they're just terrorizing these people. Because they will be audacity to publicly speak. I'd like to send these to you. And you know, how long did it take? How many minutes did it take? Not good man. And for they started to be smear and smear and smear, can't pay not hurt. Because she had the audacity to suggest that her son gave his life for nothing, based on a pack of lies. Shame on her. So there are a lot of people. And this is where the way fashion is in more, you know, you silence everybody. And it's like the thing where the report is now. They're fond that's served we had yesterday. And you think America cares? But we're not going to let it out. That's a problem. But we got to our folks there on CNN talking crap. It can't have a can. Oh brother. I'd like to see a big tumor griner forehead, right before two o'clock. 250 votes were doing great on that poll. Sensational. The woman you most desire. We're doing great on a website. We're doing great with everything else. But the thing with the CD. How much you think we're going to raise? You said three months we're going to do the so be March April May. Oh, forty five. I say I say just to be sure let's let's carry on until the summer schedule starts. Okay. Like a middle of June. From my June vacation. How's that 50 grad? Think we can do that? Yeah. That wouldn't be too bad. Wouldn't be bad at all. That would make it all worthwhile. I mean we're almost at 13 right now. Really we'd be aesthetic. We would be squeezing our knee cast. We'd be like dancing a jig and a kazaki and a kainohora and whatever else. If I tool clock we got that extra tune in 35 bucks. Do you think it's going to happen? No. No. Why not? Why are you so negative? Well, it's just must not. No wonder our clearance hates you. Not even. It was very we had a good chat. Good. I relieved. As the bishop said, we haven't understand it. Of course remember what happened to the bishop clearance. Don't forget that. Now that was a good scene. Remember that when he went to something down there. Spiral steer case. That was a long fall. Yeah. The flowing flood of the river is going down there. I mean all that was sort of lovely here. And such a nice outfit. Well, I think you got to say about those. Those pansies that we had. You know, bad at can be sure. I'm going to stamp you, grissers. Yeah, they are. I was going to say, Faggot. Very bon first. Kirby pocket died. I couldn't very bon Zed died. And Kirby pocket.

I'm like that to be doing all emorrides. And if this book, and I just have a feeling they didn't publish a book like that without no one there crap having their ducks in a row. They don't really is trying to make a couple of buck creams and potions and locians and smearness and pop and piled. I think that had like an asterisk because the idea that put him in the same category would like real ball players like this guy and stop baby Ruth. What? It's tired this argument. Put him in the same category would like real ball players. And what? And then we like putting race horses that are that are using stimulants and drugs in the same category would like nigh atross and secretary of stuff like that. He's a real Roger. This is 5. 16. 2. 8.
