Heels up next, thanks for listening. The beauty cracker, the beauty program. I think it's a matter of how many of you are. You know what's like those, that would be a big blast group. It's fast, appetite. At a bargelle, they kick some ass baby. The biggest name, the best talent this is 42560. W.U.U.A.M. Miami 4th, Florida, take home. Yeah, yeah. Oh god. I have a dream. A dream that one day, there shall be a failing reality show called survival. And to save the show, they shall take little white children, and little black children, and little Asian children, and little Hispanic children, and cigarette bound from one another a gravity. I have a dream that these children will one day live on an island where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the ability to eat a don't beetle with a vomiting I have a dream. And when this happens, black sunquites, Hispanics and Asians will join, hands and sing in the words of Jeff Proves. The time has spoken, the time has spoken. Like the rain, the time has spoken. And someone is also here to write the best way to show that you're not violent, and that there are four crampas to go out and kill some people. That's it, right? See how raw you are? If some silly old dozeny address gets up there and starts making quotations about killing it by with a sword and all of a other craft. And just go out and prove that he's wrong. Kill some people. That's right. Law of a bunch of churches. Maybe in none. She was, she was forgiving her soldiers. By the way, as she died, did you read that? No, I didn't. You said, oh, we understand why you people have to kill some people, right? See, this is, it's all sick, man. It's all hate. It's all hate. And by the way, we got 984 votes on the full. All right. Our goal is a thousand during the show, then I'm going back to bed. I think it's because you put that S word on there. Man, there is nothing worse than, oh, well, I won't say nothing worse. There are a lot of worse things, but when you have that 24 hour flu, well, I guess the other thing worse than that is like a two week flu. Yeah. The big way, man, you never know. And your head feels like it's so achy, but it feels like an achy breaky. You know, like if you just move it a little bit, it's going to explode. And you have the chills in the fever. Oh, now, what's a 101? I mean, 98.6, I know it's normal, but it's 101. That's not good. Not good. Well, that's what I had on whatever day it was. Yesterday, two nights and no, no, I'd be four. And then I just laid out yesterday, so that's where it goes. I want to apologize by the way, Joel, fine, bird. I know you found that bird strange. No, really, you know where I'm going. That I said, I said, I said, I'm going to say that that's just a hand, but to anybody else in this business that I've ever criticized and self-loat. And I said this before. And oh, 97. We'll make that thousand before when I refresh it the next time. I'll have a thousand votes. I look back to bed. Oh, oh, oh. The idea that anybody on this station would criticize any other radio station. Forget about self-loat in the world is so ludicrous, so laughable. But it's just pathetic. We are Schlock. You know, if they would allow that many callators, WSHL, OXCK, or just, I don't know, radio Schlock. We ought to have a big billboard campaign. All we're done is Shalayla probably be pissed off about it. She don't like them balls. Well, you know, bull dikes don't like balls. I'm sorry, Donna. But anyway, I saw on TV that I've done, Shalayla. I said that by self-ethcite, bitch. From you, women. Don't forget, by the way, speaking to you, a nice job on Saturday. All right. That must be whether all the press, huh? Let's be. Are we cursed down here? First of all, he occasions in the dolphins just stick the joint out? Stink the joint out against the bills. Oh, my God. We're cursed. Nine? What? I think we're cursed to QAM because we have a new regime man. These people, they're not to make you pissed off enough to go out and kill some people. That's right. I was going to go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out. That was in five votes and the phone is ringing all kinds of stuff going on. This new regime, we not. They would know already, if you stuck on Jaggi. Remember, they, they, they, you seem to produce the old. We had, we had our filco, like a floor, floor model, filco. They white thing. They look like a piece of furniture. Right. You could stick one of those up there collective ass. They still wouldn't know anything about radio. It's just amazing to me. Okay, said, these people make me want to go in kill some people. Even though I don't care, like you said, I mean, they don't care. It's obvious. So why don't we care? We just don't care. And this sales guy, his, his concept, it's like, sure, it's a numbers. Let's just splatter a bunch of crap on the log. Man, let's throw 7,000 spots in dollar a hour. Anybody want to spy a spot for a dollar? No. 50 cent. What about that? How about 30 minutes in? Anybody want to buy some spots? I'm going to tell this story because it just, even though it's a personal thing in the audience, it's really clear about this. But after all, complaining and bitching and money, and rightfully so, for all these years, oh, we're going to actually go on a higher copy person now. Do they really have such a person who's actually there when they're like, I'm not him. Him, him. So there's a guy in that building who's supposed to be writing copy, y'all something. I made this come in there one of these days and kill some people. That's right. Including starting with him. Whoever that is, we'll give you a ticket. I got a piece of copy here for an account that's been out with me for about 75 years, which believe me, we have very few of kinds of less thanks to this current regime. But anyway, and what they did is they took effect. It's still got Troy Stratford's name on her who hasn't been selling for us for weeks now. And everything that they took a copy that was May 1st of this year. And they crossed out to date, they magic marker down, they wrote on their 915. And he made exactly the same piece of turn. Obviously, that's not something that copyrighted, I did. No, of course, we can't tell you who did it. And because we don't know who there's nobody's name on here, watch these, we're responsible for this piece of turn, like I said. It's just, it's got nothing to do with businessmen. These people don't want to do business. They want to do monkey business. I get an email yesterday from Joe Bell about, oh, Mr. One year today, and sure hope this find you're feeling better. You know, that's all well and good, but rather than massaging in this shooting, I'd much rather have to get something done, you know? I keep coming here this morning and again, now we didn't have any volume. I know we had a Marlon game, but there was like no, no, this was yesterday, this was over the week. Oh, after the weekend, of course. But you got to understand, we had Marlon's games, we had the hurricane game, and we had the dolphin, the real pre-game, and we'll post game, and the real foreplay, and the real, uh, we picked Jar Vaseline, the line. Right, I'm sure of that. You know how to do that, but that's what I go. You're a parents and the clients and the creeper, we're like, all fours when you came in. They used all my paper tells that they, at least could hold a minute. But they are vastly in enters, but they're using them, but just a paper towel. So they used ones in the garbage, would you please? Yeah. We're like somebody, we're out of one, see it. Yeah. By 2017 vote, some go back to bed, especially after parents coming in and do not come in there again, Dumbled. I keep telling you, please do not come in there. I'll do it to get me aggravated. I just hear his voice, and I do get so agitated. But I hear doing a hell of a job, Joe, you and your partner and crime there, and a Chris from sales that Yahoo, he brought in there to handle the sale. There, see what they did is they boost the building up. Guy had no idea why, because they splattered a whole bunch of, you know, 15s and 30s and 80-billion units on the log. And we're supposed to say, hey, heck of a job, guys, you made budget. Well, that's what it's all about. Yeah. We don't care about life pretending to be a radio station. We don't even have a license to on a hell can we? Anyway, I want to spend more than two to three hours on it. Who the hell is James Franco? All of it at E-Billy's and pictures? And now that's so, sounds so gay. Yeah, gay, gay, man. Go ahead. All right, well, now he looks like my kind of guy, you know? I'm sure he doesn't think so, but he looks like he was on the scene in this morning. For this year, what's the number? Yeah, that's true. What's the movie he's in? Fly boys. Oh, that sounds like my kind of people. That's what you said. Yeah. Anyway, James Franco, he looks like he could play a mirely in my team. And anyway, the paper is one, but that's, you know, I always tell you they have difficulty closing the deal. They always tell you, you know, play great for a long pain. And even games when they're like, question the competition. They like to let them back in for a little excitement factor. Just for aggravation. Pants are open to exhibitionist season. They lost to the one in top, we're Tuesday got hitting the head. All right. Well, the syrup, Todd, you butcher, you lunatic. Anyway, let's get down of the show. Okay, and put your bitch in. It's not going to change. They don't care. They do not care. I've already shut off the phone thing. If you think I'm taking any calls today, you're dreaming. Ever had something by Johnny Burnett, Dreamin? All but I could boot that up. No, no. He also did it to steam. Not the one that we got that we can't play anymore. Of course, we can't play much of anything. We've got to continue tying our hands behind our backs. There you go. Johnny Burnett. Okay. There's a lot of stuff on the screen. That's about enough of that. Dreamin's Johnny Burnett. Could he go out of his room? No. Go out about it. Eight people look down to sound. Eight people are out. That's fair, Johnny. I am always dreaming. It's like that sound. It's 16 was a good sound too. Am I dreaming myself or did Ringo Star rip off that and redo it? I think he did. Considering how great they were, I suppose to be in John and Paul were at once upon a time when John was still alive and Paul was before he became a serial man. You know, they were some great music, etc. But they also did some real crap. No, you wouldn't expect any great music from Ringo anyway. No, he was a nice guy. Your version did some good stuff. Yes, he did. I'm sure it's Harrison. He's still dead though. Spick. Man. You're on fire. Oh, we didn't go kill him. I'll come here tonight. See this proves that there's no God. John is dead and Ringo is still alive. I rest my case. There's anything else we need to know. By the way, Miguel is with us today. He's having one hell of an issue with that fetish plays you were talking about. Oh, not ever go there again. Ever. And you know how much our last fetics. And we know it's not. You're a great that it's not. It's those people that work in that place. Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. There actually isn't other spot here that I missed because the log is all written over and everything. Look at that in the first break. Oh, I listen. I almost missed it and I can't afford to be missing out. And he says there's nothing on the log anymore. No, seriously. Duff would have a never spiked out. She'd be going to a sniff. You're fair. I want pep to happen. We seem to be having some log issue. That's because they heard like a lot of whole. They just came in and they like fired everybody in. I want pep to happen. I want. We seem to be having some log issue. That's because they heard like a lot of whole. They just came in and they like fired everybody in. I don't know how much to do people. I've never owned a radio. And of course sales department, remember what you were telling me. We've got 800 people back there. I'll jammed in that you wouldn't believe it. We need to build like a quads. Wow. Next to the built-in. Fantastic. And they're doing a hell of a job. Not. 12 minutes past 10 at 5, 60 WQM. I feel better though. We finally got over my very current headache there. That Josh threw it over again. Do not come in there. Clarence do not come in there unless you want me to go back to bed. George is on fire anyway. He's doing it. Let's do it.

This is in Alice Island said you can and this is an invasion amen even doc else from the pirates would agree with that Not from the pirates about 30 years ago But in spite of type of cannons ramblings and rannies, which we have in a degree with president Bush is approval rating has we bounded up to 44% Oh my god the highest level in the year in the latest USA Gallup full a newspaper reports today Must be because the word Iraq is going so well Bush is approval rate and that and of course what did I tell you weeks ago about the price against how we're gonna come tumbling down Just before the election did I tell you that yes you did only the dumbest of the dumb can believe that that's It's only cute points in Emma and that the day after the election It's not gonna go back up to like 75 bucks a gallon. Who are you kidding? W obviously some people Bush is approval rating jump five points from the 39% the previous Paul conducted earlier this month The bonds comes with seven weeks before the election to the side control of Congress and in falling gas prices And when you can't paint about Bush to boost support for the war in Iraq and the portrayal Republicans is more competent than Democrats on security The evil doers they want to yell at get you man the evil to worse For the first time since the December of last year and majority of people pulled it not say that war in Iraq was a mistake The response was put evenly 49 to 49 now here. This is the best part all right However the pull finds that the Iraq war continues to be a problem for Bush 60% that it is never clear plan for handling Iraq and 75% said Iraq is in a civil war today Now stop and put those two okay, we're evenly split at 49 49 as far as whether they're going to war in Iraq was a mistake But 75% said that it's in a civil war Yeah, can you put those two together?

So the movie with Susan Serena was saved passage, okay, 1994, but she plays the mother we've got seven sons. All right, never heard of it. And one of them is often the middle east somewhere, and building is fine, I don't know where the hell he is. 94. And the building is fine, I'm waiting on television and find out what he's alive at dinner. And the ending is corny and predictable in the adiatic. But it's pretty good. And the father is usual as a real slime ball sandwicherford. Haven't seen him, huh? No, but talented or stupid. It is interesting, it's pretty good. She's actually very good in there, just she get naked. No, okay, I don't think so. He's out in the movie anyway, okay. Mike Whitney, right? So wonder, he's kind of ray-witteny. Bush is cool and degrading presidency. He says Washington is a moral swamp, when the chief executive can stand at the presidential podium and make an honor-bastopil for torture, then the American dream is dead-did-did. Bush hates American, only God knows why. He's been void along his entire life on a raptor wealth and privilege, distancing himself from his endless faders one after the other, flop, flop, flop. Still, President of the cod piece wants one more. Another pound of flesh to inflate his better alcohol saturated ego. He wants to stuff out anything, even vaguely resembles Otto or Decent's ear, dignity. So it can permeate the world with his own fiendish image, beaming from TV's across the globe. Fact, I think he's got a lot of income in common with those ragheads, you know why? What do I say with hobbies? It's a kill-so-peep death. Who can ever have a marriage in the president of the West making the case for torture like some flannel-mouth medicine man at a tent show? Where is your sense of decency, sir? The shame that Bush has brought on this country is nearly as great as the ignominy hipped-uh, hepe-domination by the Republican-Rubberstand Congress. The House of Representatives is the real moral swamp, not once in six years of hasty-up to Bush, not once, meanwhile, the country is purg-roth to war on a pack of lies. The president is authorized unlimited spying on the American people. 300,000, mostly poor black people were ethnically cleansed in the warlands, and countless thousands of innocent mussels have been kept in bondage in American Gulaggs. And don't bother defending their phony-makayan in his cover as a far-right toti's gassing with Bush on so-called secret evidence, what a joke. Makayan never saw a war he didn't like. He's chairman of the International Republican Party, a slick-sounding NGO that topples foreign government like Hugo Chavez, they don't believe every nickel of the world's wealth to go to the upper one percent. Even as fight against secret evidence's pure fiction, if Makayan the Maverick wins, American health prisoners will still not have the right to challenge their case in federal court or sue for damages in the case of unlawful arrest. Makayan, Warner, and Graham have removed the habeas corpus to foundation of American jurors' prisoned- a prudence dating back 800 years in English law as a fundamental human right. The only rights the prisoners will have are the right to appear before three of Rommistrel's handpicked stuages to plead for mercy. This is not a travesty. Republicans love to lavish praise on that inved-ert racist, Winston-Bong the Nicarious Churchill. Here's where Churchill said about habeas corpus. The power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any change known as the charge known to law, and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers, is in the highest degree odious, and the foundation of all to tell a theory in government whether or not you are communist. According to the AP, there are more than 14,000 of these unlucky souls and bushes gool eyes right now. That doesn't include the tens of thousands in American concentration camps and detention facilities. Bush not only claims the rights to hold them indefinitely, but wants the Congress to endorse his rights to torture them as he sees fit. This is the very definition of tyranny. Here's Bush defending torture in the September 6 speech. He said, captured terrorists have a unique knowledge about how terrorists never separate, and how they have what plots are under way. The ticking time bomb forest. Our security depends on getting this kind of information. Like the September PVB, been lawed in tightening strike on America. Many out kind of are Taliban fighters try to conceal their identities and withhold information that could save American lives. They've received training and how to resist interrogation. And so the CIA used an alternate set of procedures. These procedures were designed to be safe to comply with our laws, our constitution, our treaty obligations, the Department of Justice reviewed the authorized message extensively and determined them to be lawful. And why change the laws, George? No harm, no foul. Bush wants to change law because he knows the procedures constitute torture, a violation of the war crimes act and the Geneva conventions. His petition for torture goes far beyond a statistic urge to inflict pain in other human beings. It's a trouble solved on the fundamental principles which end to score the bill rights. It's an expression of the hatred he feels for our system, our laws and our prevailing ethos. It's way of forcefully removing any obstacles to absolute power. The opponents of torture are modern day, flimsy, lympharic defense that torture procedures unreliable produces unreliable information or that it may put our own soldiers at risk. What gibberish? That's the simplest equivocating of lawyers, not humans. We oppose torture because it's a moral evil. It makes no difference if he religious or not. There is no lower form of human activity and it's like the pain on another person. None. Even killing somebody allows them to retain some trace of dignity. Torture or not robes them even a bat. You like to win reading this very well. That's right. Anyone who thinks torture is quite is unfit to lead. In fact, there are cancer on society. Bush's reading against these unique conventions is a sign of a man who accepts no legal or ethical constraints in his behavior. It's a blanket defensive, cruelty, and untack on our core principles as Americans. It's a language of a dictator who's so-so-laced operations the expansive is on the spot of power. Bush says that the wording of Geneva is vague and that outrageous against human dignity is hard to decipher. That's because he plans to push the limits of law by exacting as much pain as possible from his victims. Geneva is not vague. It intentionally cast a broad net to disperse any harsh treatment of detainees in one's charge. It's condemnation of the cruel and human and degrading human and degrading human prisoners has never been challenged because it's a clear indictment of any such punishment. What is it that Bush does not understand about our laws and traditions? How can a man reach the pinnacle of power without the slightest resolve to defend even minimal standards of human decency? An earlier little rights have no geographic body, the depravance of every person. Prisoners and roll us in total human rights identity body else. The president's plea to repeal the Geneva conventions is a poor tenses reminder of how absolute power corrupts absolutely and how quickly America stood in the quicksand of moral depravity. I'd like that could hold my question. You go way away with neither them again. I'll go to the first night and I can picture the James Franco. Check your your your your your your your your your your your you. Check my your who. Oh no he's in the sales department. They're man. Oh yeah who man Chris Jones you discontinue still morning.

And I package. Oh, I think it goes. And that's going to make me sick of my stomach. Oh, wait. You're just. Yes. Yeah. Bullcraft. Tell them the left fed ass where you're about instead of trying to be a bush boss. So you do not go there ever again. I've heard. My kinkos here man. Everything that I told you. We're just like clockwork. There's no problem. No problem. And you managed to find. It's come because that's your house. That's right. That's my luck. So you thought it was convenient. Guess what? Wrong. Atlantic City. A New Jersey gay rights group. I wonder what James Franco thinks about that. A New Jersey gay rights group thought a share impersonator who happened to be a man would live an up and democratic party meeting. But met resistance instead. The state Democrats gathered in Atlantic City, which Steve Goldstein found to have gotten state equity a gay rights organization. Books shared to appear in full share regalia and let's think a few of the singers wait a minute. Steve Goldstein found out of a gay rights organization. Garden City quality. I think I said equity. Well, it's partially it's. Blur dog. But before the impersonator could hit the state, the state party official approach Goldstein. As witness is told the New York star, Legion said, we can't have that walking in the hallway. What if the pressies that? Well, they report on that and tomorrow's papers. You know, like it like that thing. It's exactly what he'll do. Remember the thing? Oh, God. Share diggin in a couple of numbers. I'm already among those dancing was Senator Loretta Weinberg, Burgundy, 71 year old grandmother. Share wasn't great Weinberg told us they're a legend, but I survived it. And I didn't catch anything. I'm still wearing women's clothing. I'd be like that. I wonder what Steve Goldstein said about that. See, you think you know somebody and you find out all of a sudden, I don't know where. I'm 100, and two votes on the pool look at that man. 12. 102? Is that incredible or what? Oh, but you, a butchish speech if you went at 11.30, we're going to be listening that. No chance. No chance. I wouldn't pollute my or your earrings with that craft, I can. Most, here's the pool today. And of course in the wake of all the great things that are going on the world that they loved, the brotherhood, the kindness, the understanding. Most religious people are full of Schmidt. 739, 61 point. Oh, there's off my dinner job. I guess I sang it. Now that I can. Schmidt 739, 61.1% of everybody in this audience, 70 or full of crap, all your religion is man, you're evil. You're the ones that we need to avoid like crazy, like the plague stay away from us. They're full of hate 277. That's why they like to. We're a filibunch of people. I hate this pool 89. Well, it's too bad. Emotional cripples. They're full of kindness, 76 and love, only 27. How, six, 12, see 8.4% say something like they're full of something good, which means over 90% look out, beware. Oh, right. Yeah, look out now. God tell you, like my stiff neck and my shoulder mat, I'm dead, too. And all of it's insurance coming to this morning. The 50's name is the best teleарищ.

That's the chicken egg steak on the Canadian boeshoe. But you forgot to mention one thing. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. So James Franco and it leave it to you to find that picture man. Every other picture he looks fabulous. I think you did that just because you found out he was Jewish. Oh, he is? Yes. I didn't do that on purpose. I thought I'd send that shirtless picture that. James Edward Franco, well they had the one on top would have done very nicely. Okay, that one on the bottom he looks really. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Although if we wanted to spell that he lives in LA, that should disprove it. He has dated actress Marla Sokolov with whom he co-starred me film whatever it takes. You know who Marla Sokolov is? No. Oh, well he has dated her not lately though. He was chosen by people magazine as one of the 50 hottest bachelor's of 2004. He paints extensively in his free time. Yeah. And even tended to private painting school during his teen years. His works already been displayed in art galleries and he's also currently, let's say he's signed a return in Spider-Man 3. We released May 4, 2007. I'm going to George Worth close up the world before that. And by the way, lots of rumors, especially in the time of news was there, but the ran attack, we had the Iraqi attack which worked out very, very well. And I was thinking about an aran attack. Great. And WWE 3 like Newt-Egeen, we've got it on. Oh, look at that, one, two, three, four. Man. If, well let's me gain, he could just count that high. One, two, three, four. He could only count the three though. And that's why I thought it was there to down. What are these things you're sending me? Here's one that says, I thought you might enjoy this article also. There's an article in today's The Herald Sports Festival. WWE KMA and the ticket with the headline, Disappointed South Florida's fans speak their peace. Oh my God, Andy and my Mbj says, have a sweet new year. I'll dab in for you. That's right. We got to do holidays coming up. I forgot about that. Look at that. Tank's roll into Bangkok, Thailand, and the mid-Rumors of a cool, All right, I like that. And you know who just left there, don't you? Who? John Mark Carr. Quencherovian queen, Roul Castro. It says, over the past six weeks, Americans have learned quite a bit about Roul Castro, who took over a set of the Cuban government in late July, wanting they haven't been told hi ever or something. Middians of Cubans have long taken for granted. They're a little bro at his day. How do you like that? Now we know what that movie was all about. Eating Roul? Oh yeah. It's not a new rumor by any means, but it's flamed up again. Flamed up. Hey, hey, hey. And you like the Patelle hospitalization for an estuple bleeding. New Zardacles on ex-al-web sites about the hand-of-worked May-proof temporary Patelle of a recovery. Our routinely accompanied by a reader comments that, we're sure to rally as El Matic Cone. A Spanish derogatory term equivalent to Faggot. Matic Cone. Some sites claim he's bisexual. He is after all married with four children. Our cross-dresser. While others name his alleged partners, ask how widespread the belief is. They remember our Cuban ex-al-family for my mutual radar simply. Everyone knows Roul is gay. And it goes on a clear line. Well, all right. In fact, his daughter, Mary L. L. Castro is the country's leading advocate for Gilles Lesby and then transgendered rights. Uh-huh. If it were a touchy issue with your father, I don't think he'd be running the transgender clinic, which I guess maybe that's why Dick Cheney's a daughter such a big advocate. I don't know. Either way, it says the rumors endured for years. Alan Ginsford wrote about an ex-journal, and Andy Warhol alluded to in his 1965 film, and he was a child of one-eater Castro. And it isn't likely to die anytime soon. If it all does die, or cruising the Castro could take on a whole new meaning. Oh, our art art. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha. That's bad. Doug Thompson writes, a shame to be an American. You know, your buddy Doug Thompson can be a little black. Looks like he's really ready. He's ready. More columns now than when, well, now that he's underground somewhere. And they can't find him. Ty Prime Minister clears a state of emergency. That was mild and constant. Oh, no. The accusations of dirty tricks and rigging the election. And in the end. Sounds like a murderous. But another one, and that was supposed to happen next month. It looks like now, the military, or someone has got their board with weighting for democracy to be restored, or for this election to happen. And they stepped in and it looks like they've tried to do something themselves. So I'm John Mike Hart. I have a confession. I killed a crocodile hunter. It isn't mean to accidentally post him with my 20 bar and taking forest possibilities. And it will need to face charges. And I'll show you if I can fly first class on quadrups. Throw it over. Shrimp on the bar, he. Ha-ha-ha. That is so good. Pretty unusual, huh? Yeah. Good. I'm going to send something pretty good. 23 past 11 Doug Thompson says, I never thought I'd reach the poor, where I was ashamed of my country. I was wrong. I've loved America for most of my 58 years. I fought for her, killed for her, led for her, and damn you're died for her more than once. I served my country even when I thought she was wrong because I felt it was my duty as an American to do so. But I can no longer do so, Doug. He writes, American days become what we always stood up against a turret, a destroyer of freedom, and international murderer with no regard for human rights or life, no morality, and no belief in the rule of law. American now threatens the peace of the world far more than any terrorist group, any communist country, any tinhorn dictated with a suitcase, nook. I've lived with the Americans for one year and eight months as if I was living in a held bag dead, shopkeeper, Ahmad Chad, Kassim al-Ali'awi, told the APF they was released from 20 months in captivity, without ever being charged with a crime, or even being told what he was suspected of doing. According to an AP investigative report, the American government holds some 14,000 detainees and secret prisons around the world. If you have any idea why they're held, all are denied legal representation, even given details of the charges against them, and many are later released without our slaves, even in the apology. If you got forbid our innocent Afghan who gets sold on the river by some warlord rival, you can end up at Vagram and have absolutely no way of clearing your names at John Sifton of human rights watch in New York. You can't have a lawyer of present evidence, or do anything organized to get yourself out of there. Evidence continues to mount that many of these prisoners are tortured and ways that violate the Geneva Convention, and international court that governs how civilized nations are supposed to treat prisoners of war, and President Bush reminds us constantly that we were at war with terrorism. But America, where we'd use it war with itself, a tax remover in by a madman president who claims the divine mission from God, waiting a fierce battle against the principles that once guided this nation, and said it above those who treated human life with Calisdus regard, and claimed any means no matter how barbaric, justified the cause. America's no longer respected by its allies, had murdered on the world's stage of trusted by its own citizens, so that's Chris Jones. Polls shown overwhelming majority of Americans think Bush lies based war in Iraq was a monumental mistake. Most also think in President of the West is dishonest, and that our government lies to us on a regular basis. Sadly, they're right. Iraq war is an incredible food bar that is destroyed in the nation, created new heaven for terrorists and cost more American lives than the attack on the world's transcendor of New York. Bush is not only a serial liar, but an unstable despot who sanity is increasingly doubted by members of his own family and party. He ignores the will of a people he's supposed to serve, violates international law to will, and treads the Constitution law when the freedoms that are once protected. America's detainment of charges, and then released with that escalation or apology merely a 18700 people since June of 2004, the AP investigation found. Many of those released alhorstors of their treatment world imprisoning torture by attaching electric saliris through general areas, waterboarding, creating the fear of drowning by submerging prisoners, use of dogs and threats of long-term imprisonment. While the debool curving 26 told the AP, how his guards would wheel the ranch a little authority. Tell us about the ones who attack Americans in the neighborhood, quoted in the terror, and gave her a saying, or I will keep you in prison for another 50 years. Such treatment only fuels hatred toward this country. I will hate Americans for the rest of my life for him, said. I understand why Korean hate Americans in the country they represent. I don't hate America. I love my country, but I hate what our so-called leaders have done to it. Thanks to the illogical illegal and insane actions of George W. Bush and those who follow him. Americans can no longer hold their heads high and take pride in their country. Bush and those fellow service have destroyed a great country and if you're the damage of maybe permanent and irreparable. Here, reputable. I think you're like that, that's because you put these oxamps in. All right. What do we go to waterboarding? So enough to make you want to go out and... Is it really worth it? I mean, I guess I need to put that out of button because I think we're going to be a lot of people. I'm really curious. Especially those good religions going to be going up to... Filso people.

No. No, usually when you're on you have, you know, but 10 people. No seriously. They loved it. It must be because it was more than anti religious thing. You must be advancing the populous today. Yes, I was. With all those raggants. All those schmotha heads. All of the above. Yeah. I want to about the if wouldn't that have been a logical response to that.

Sores is August Terraplaught is a fiction underscoring police failures written by NaFes Osmed. British Army experts can't doubt on liquid explosives threat. I'll kind of never had an in the fund in the UK. The Tenacrill written, retired Lieutenant Colonel Nigel Wilde, not related to Oscar Wilde. A former senior British Army intelligence officers suggested that the police and government story about the Terraplaught revealed August 10th was part of a pattern of lies and deceit. British and American government officials have described the operation which resulted in the rest of 24 Northland British Muslim suspects as a resounding success. 13 of the suspects have been charged and two released without charges. According to security sources, the Terraplaught's best were fined and board up to ten civilian airliners and detonate highly volatile liquid explosives on the plans in a spectacular terrorist operation. The liquid explosives either TATP, Triastatone, Trackaroxide, DADP, Diastatone, Diferoxide, or less sensitive, I guess you're hiding in your diapers. I guess, or less sensitive, HMTP, textomethylene, Tri-Peroxide, Diamine, were reportedly to be made on board the plans by mixing sports drinks with a peroxide based household gel and then be detonated using an MP3 player or mobile phone. But Lieutenant Colonel Wilde was awarded the Queen's Gountry Mental for his command to be the Elfastic Sということance disposal unit in 74. Described this scenario as fiction. Creating liquid explosives is a highly dangerous and sophisticated tasky he says, one that requires not only significant chemical expertise, but also the appropriate equipment. The idea that these people could sit in the plain toilet and simply mix these together normal household fluids to create a highly explosive, a high explosive capable blowing up the interrogation on tenable. Let me see that again, on tenable. So Lieutenant Colonel Wilde who was trained in an examination technical officer responsible for terrorist bomb disposal at the Royal Army Ordnance Camps in San Furst. After working as a bomb, the fuseer in Northern Ireland Lieutenant Colonel Wilde became senior officer in the British Army in 1777 during the Cold War he collected in Teldas's part of undercover East German liaison unit and then he went on to develop a bubble. Who cares? So who came up with the idea that a bomb could be made on board? Not all kind of for sure it wouldn't work. In law and as interested in success, not the turns by failure he said. The story has been blown all out of proportion that liquids would need to be carefully distilled of freezing temperatures to extract the required chemicals which are very difficult to obtain in the purity needed. Once the fluids have been extracted, the process of mixing them produces significant amounts of heat and vile fumes that resulting liquid then needs some hours of room temperature for the white crystals that are the explosive to develop. The whole process which can take between 12 to 36 hours is very dangerous even in the lab and can lead to premature detonation since Lieutenant Colonel Wilde. If there was a conspiracy yet it didn't involve manufacturing explosives in the Lou as this simply did not have worked in the Lou. The process would be quickly and easily detected. The fumes of the chemicals in the toilet would be smelt by anybody in the area smelt. They'd be melted and we smelted. Well do you see that? The space shuttle man they got sourced out of the floating debris outside of the normal water. I think it's an evil door zone too. Or maybe it's a flying sausage. They would also inevitably cause the alarms in the toilet and the air change system in the aircraft to be triggered. The pilot has the ability to dump all the air from an aircraft as a firefighting measure leaving people to use oxygen mass. All this means the plants and tech will be detected long before the cues outside the Lou and go into enormous lengths. The cue and the Lou. How do you like that? That means one. It's on our website. Read it. Read it in weep. You realize by a new we're going to have over 13 number votes. Excellent. They see even George says excellent. What's he usually says who cares? Who cares? Who cares? He was a cramp. We don't want to read about the dead people in the aircraft. No more than propaganda Neil. Nobody wants you about dead bodies in Iraq. Okay. It's bad. It's just propaganda. That's right. Just more than anti-bush crap that you keep spewing. Speaking of our friend. I've been waiting to read this one. Millsford Connecticut. A man who claims he had a heart attack during a dispute over an ill-fitting a herpes. That didn't. Oh, but it matches her color. It's suing the way shop. There's nothing worse than an ill-fitting herpes. You know what I'm saying? That's correct. Sorry. Little slow. Oh no. Let's see. What about that? The doctor that performed the surgery on Jay Seedless dump. Didn't need the same doctor that performed the procedure on your QP. The doctor who performed the surgery. Let's think about that. This is the same. Why? He was doctor. I don't know who he was. Do you enjoy color? I'm not sure. I'm not sure where he went. I'm not sure where he went. Did he go to Holy Cross? I didn't read it. Not sure. Well, bottom line is that doctors can't tell how long Jay is going to be at? No, you're not sure. Somewhere at least a month could be up to eight weeks. Somewhere there. While he had the world with your QM. Paul Lewis claims he suffered a heart attack that happened refusing to pay for the hairpiece that was not only the wrong size, but also the wrong color. He's seeking more than $15,000 in damages. Lewis filed a counter-suton superior court after Paul's wig boutique of orange. filed a small plan to act in seeking color hours in payment for the hairpiece. Lewis claims he fell in December 2004 after Paul Award. The owner of the wig shop threatened to call police because he refused to pay. Lewis told a good post that would sold him the hairpiece in a dark and room. He didn't realize it was the wrong color until later. He said he put a stop on a payment on a check-ashe to the shop. What said he had no idea why? Lewis suffered a heart attack over the incident. And then he was so happy with the hairpiece when he left the shop that he hugged me and thanked me. He said he had a better shop as brightly lit and Lewis left the hairpiece during the day. He said he looked at the moment and then he was laid around. He came like in that comedian routine. When some people used to leave home in a morning, they looked in the mirror and looked at me. He was really spiffy. Then he came in and worked. Everyone was like that. 133 votes, tanks roll in the bank, cocktail and a room or a coup. No one seems to know exactly why that's happening as I mentioned. What does that have to do with who killed John Beney? He had to do with the tank, the Thai Prime Minister. He was not happy with why Anna Nicole's kid died. Do you ask that you when General Assembly are telling those things that we are all? He looked pretty much at the time of that anyway. He had that fake letter. He was standing pretty bad. He don't usually look your best at death. You look like, I don't know that. I don't know what River Phoenix looks like when he was dying on the sidewalk. He was Jewish. Not a good time for people in their die. He's only one thing about the females on earth and said you're much anyway. Like Paul O'Dowell. What does that mean? Turn code. But at least when you see the Jewish males on the earth, He has one thing when you find out the Jewish. I want to get to person. I don't want to get to person. I don't get to person. They get to person. They get to person. Maybe that's why they called a River Phoenix. Maybe what that whole family got those bizarre names. Princess Winterfell, summer string and rain. How does Joaquin feel about that? I don't know. Very careful. He there were pictures. 13. Yeah, that could be it. There were some names on there. Some Julio name. And it sounded a little suspicious to me. Got a bunch of them. James Franco. There's a good Jewish guy. He's a certain respect. And Italian Jew. I have that guy. Get out of here. Why? Because his name is Franco. How about a Spanish Jew man? How about French? He's a Franco. He wouldn't know Italian. That's right. See? He could be a Spendard. Could be a Cuban Jew. He could be. We got tons. No, you know. We were full of Schmidt. 790. Oh, don't mind. No, take a personal Jew. 790. Oh, hey, 2008. I hate this pool. 97.74 percent. That person's a little bit too hot. We don't. We take a number to that. Okay. I think it's a fine pool. I bet you even shone out there. Thanks. It's a fine pool. And even though I've created the full things. It's pretty good. Me. Kindness 81. And love. How many people are saying religions? We're just to leave people. People. Not to the man. Oh, love. Yeah. Full of crap. You got a right baby. Over 60 percent. Oh, the time Prime Minister declared a state of emergency is unresteads bang cock. Should it have been put on him involving us? What does she say? What were you she said? And a power. Oh, she said something been put on him. Her, her, him. It got. I sound a little bit more incoherent. Because I probably should be back in bed. Thanks a lot, Clarence. 825 this morning. I came in here feeling great. After about three minutes with you. It was like, uh, I'm dying on the hands. The TV's being soaked. That's how I stood this is. I could have followed my two minds. We're waiting on. We're finally going to shoot. Okay. Damn. This is Mark Morgan. It's the 12 to one hour on Q8 down. Get through just got back today. That jerk, to you who used to play.

Man, he thought he was cool, but he was really not. What a joke that several moments. And that time at the Cowboys play. When you dance, the little girl would have destroyed. They're never grand over and got on his face. And now he thinks they won't forget it. The boys are back to clown, the boys are going down. I said, the boys are back to clown. The boys are down. That's a joke that's been hanging out. This is always around. The boys are back to clown. The boys are going down. Tom, I'll show you man, he's a real credit. Didn't he just the bus is pinkier or something in this past weekend? Oh, T.O. Oh, he's gonna show you the bill. You can't tell. I don't know. I beg your pardon. I was wondering if Dalton was paying attention to. In other words, you have it. You've been listening to this radio station for me seven? Yeah, sure. Well, get with it. These are the kind of two things you should know. One is all about T.O. and the other one is... Okay, it's BOO! That part I got. Oh, I clear. Yeah. Thirty-one to seven. My God, that sounds like a little girl's team to me. Today, I'm going to play in a vaster or some school for the blind this weekend. Would it play an FIU? He used to. Oh, he used to min FIU. No, I thought he used to look up a more recent. Oh, I'm sorry. You have to be at least like a real team. I don't think they have any more real teams on the schedule. They don't want to schedule too many real teams on here. Don't surely leave my kid or Nick here's in a while. Because it also something I think she was right. We didn't want that on her because hervacanes don't have balls. They did not belong in a billboard on that ad campaign. Nice going, Donna. You idiot. You, uh... You're fair, Amy Act. Not fooling anybody sweetheart. Maybe she's got balls, but not the hurried cans. Speaking of people without balls, when Vyacam came from some of the redstone set of Tom Cruise's personal conduct as the reason for killing his production deal with Paramount. The 83-year-old locals can't or what Hollywood. But radar has learned Redstone may have let Cruise off easy, especially in light of allegations he acted as fast goons from the Church of Scientology to intimidate Redstone's studio chief in Brad Gray. Rimes with a day. How do you like that? Uh, huh? According to a high-ranking media exec Paramount pictures Hanjo Gray had a highly unpleasant run in with a church during his tens of negotiations with Cruise over mission impossible three. And remember what Michael Jackson proud was going on? And he had those goons there. Uh, they should have his lawn. Baby. Yeah. Gray who had recently joined the studio and her the touch to turn it to make Cruise accept the smaller share of the gross revenues. Then he had from the first to installments in the franchise. For those films he acted reportedly to come in on her out 30% of the total revenue. Not 30 minutes. Leaving the office 190, diminutive Gray, walking to his car in the Perman lap, suddenly found himself surrounded by more than a dozen Scientologists. Wow. Who pressured him to ease up on the actor court of the source. How do you like that? See, Tommy's got his buttocks, he may not be so much of himself. He's got his butch bunk bunk buddies, baby. Tough guys. It doesn't ever? Yeah. Not 30 dozen. This guy's about three feet tall. This guy. Following a tourist exchange, the visit is loud, Gray to get into his car, Lee. But the message was clear. Like Joey Zaza, you know, sent a message. So he was under by the incident sources, say, grey stood his ground after protracting negotiations. Cruise eventually agreed to a less generous deal. We either grain her perm, I responded to repeated queries. But a spokeswoman from the Church of Scientology disputes report saying, the Church has nothing to do with anybody's business affairs. But to many Hollywood veterans, the incident is reminiscent of another recent back-lot battle. In the late 90s, John Travolta, who is still there in the closet with Tommy and with our Kelly. Lobby'd reluctant former Fox Studio chief Bill mechanic to produce, oh, I'm under he was Kimed to a Mechanics. He had signed his, although, a Scientologist all over me, mechanical radar last year, they come up to you and they know who you are. Despite the religions reputation for intimidating incentives, mechanical aggray was unswayed. You think in any way, shape or form that we're doing the others going to make me want to make this movie, he said. And, of course, the answer is, oh, we sure hope not. How do you like that? John Travolta, another closet case. Sir didn't crowd in there, you know? This fog just hanging out in there, condom pleaser, and colder with a big Adam's apple. I've actually there having a real gay old time in there, and our Kelly, got a bunch of huge caps and a few haids pretty soon. In fact, you know something he might just take a page out of those good religious people, you know? If they pissed him off enough, I think inside the closet he might just kill some people. 13.24. We got one, two, three, four, you know what it's in, we were in the strange order. Don't confuse Willis now, he went to you in. Most religious people are full of Schmidt, 7.97, 60.1%, they're full of hate, 3.15, either one take your choice. I hate this pool 98, too bad, we love it. I wonder if that's, you think that's the Jesus crowd, the God and Swad or just you know, all of this, the usual mouth contents. They're full of kindness, 83. Well, I'm not going to start giving it out. I guess they're going to do it out slowly. And full of love, 31. Oh yeah. The Lord Jesus loves you. What is show you? In fact, the Catholic church they like showing you it like a little hands-on love. Yeah. It's for you. The lay-in-all of hairs. Yeah. Only is not supposed to put your hands on breakfast. That's beside the point. Deadly harvest, patri-cober and an avatar, rice, the Lebanese fields, the son with cluster bombs. That's the Lesbinies. It says the war, Lebanon has not ended. Every day, some of the median bomb looks which were far by Israeli artillery during the last three days at the conflict. Killed four people in southern Lebanon and won many more, every day. The casually figures will rise sharply in the next month, as villagers begin the harvest, picking all us from trees, whose leaves and branches hide bombs that explode at the smallest movement. Lebanon's farmers are caught in a deadly dilemma to risk the harvest or leave the produce on which they depend to rotten the fields. In a coma in a hospital bed in a bathier-lic who sane-all Ali-asmod, well, I said it, it needs some help within names, you know. A 70-year-old man from the village of Yomor, he was pruning an orange tree outside his house last week when he dislodged a bomblet. It exploded, sending pieces of streptin on it, who was brain-longed in the kidneys. I know he can hear because he squeezes my hand when I talk to him, said his daughter, Suwa, and she sent me his side or father's bed in a hospital. At least 83 people have been killed by cluster munitions since the ceasefire court to independent monitors. Some Israeli officers are protesting the use of cluster bombs, each containing 644 small but lethal bomblets, against civilian targets in Lesbinaun. A commander in the MLRS, multiple orange rocket systems unit, told the Israeli Daily Harits, that the army had fired 1,800 cluster rockets spraying 1.2 million bomblets over houses and fields. In Lebanon, recovered entire villages with cluster bombs, he said, what we did there was crazy and monstrous. What makes the cluster bombs so dangerous is that the 30 percent of the bomblets don't let them in effect. They can live for years, often difficult to see because of a small size on roofs, in gardens, in trees, besides roads or in rubbish, waiting to explode when disturbed. Maybe even in somebody's room, in Abbottia, the modern 100-bed government hospitals received 19 victims of cluster bombs since the end of the war. As we arrived, the new per-appation Osmod Sabah, see they need help for those names, he did the first name as Osmod or the middle name. Osmod Osmod, Muhammad. And life technician at the hospital was being rushed into the emergency room, a Berlin man or 45 was unconscious on a stretcher, that's a Berlin man, not a early man. Earlier in the morning, he had gone up to the flat roof of his house and checked the water tank. While there, he must have touched the pile of logs he was keeping for winter fires. There's a message for our new kids out there, don't touch your log. Unknown to him, a bomblet had fallen to the wood pile a month earlier, the large shield of him from the full force of the blast, but when we saw him, doctors were stood up trying to find out the extent of his injuries. For us the war is still going on though there was a ceasefire on 14 August and Dr. Hassan Wazney, the director of the hospital. If the cluster bombs are all exploded at the time they landed, it wouldn't be so bad, but they're still killing and maiming people. The bomblets may be small, but they exploded with devastating force on the morning of the ceasefire. Taadi had tabbed, and 11-year-old Void was brought down to the hospital. He must have been holding the bomb close to him, Dr. Wazney said, it blew off his hands and legs and the lower part of his body. We went to your mortified war who, saying, aliafamed or received his terrible wounds while pruning his orange tree, the villages at the end of a broken road, 6 miles north of Nebetea, and as overlooked by the ruins of Beaufort Castle, a crusade of fortress on a ridge above the deep valley along Wichulotani River Rans. Israeli bombians and shells have turned about a third of the houses in Yomor and to concrete sandwiches, one for a falling at top of another are the impact of explosions, some families camp in the ruins. Pileges said that they were most worried by the cluster bombs still infesting their gardens, roofs, and fruit trees, and the village street and were the wide vehicles of the Manchester-based mines advisory group whose teams are trying to clear the bomblets. It's not an easy job, especially without Diana. Whenever members of one of the magazine finds and removes a bomblet, they put a stick-painted red on top and then yellow on the ground. There are so many of these sticks that look as if some sinister planet they can root and is flourishing in the villas, kind of like the Donald Suggle and Movie there. Invasion of the body stand. The cluster bombs all ended in the last days of the war said new har had jazzy, surprisingly cheerful 65-year-old woman. There were 35 on the roof of our house and 200 in our garden so we can't visit our all of trees she said. People in Yomor depend on their all of trees and the harvest should begin now before the rains, but the trees are still full of bomblets. My husband and I can make 20 cans of oil here, which we need to sell is how jazzy said now we don't know what to do. The sheer number of their bomblets makes it almost impossible to move them all. Frederick Gross, a demining expert former in the French Navy, who is leading the mag teams in Yomor's and the year in North of the Lothani River, we have three years before people being killed every day by cluster bombs. It is really Army knows that 30 percent of them. All of these things, but third man. Do not explode at the time that their fire has so to become anti-personnel minds. Why did this really Army do it? The number of cluster bombs fired must have been greater than 1.2 million because in addition to those fired on rockets, many more were fired in 155 millimeter artillery shells. One is ready gunner said he been told the flood the area which they were firing were given on specific targets. Mr. Gross, who personally refuses 160 to 100 bomblets a day, this is the first time he has seen cluster bombs used against heavily populated villages. An editorial in horror said that the mass use of this weapon by the Israeli defense forces was a desperate last minute attempt to stop his bullets rocket firing in northern Israel. Whatever the reason for the bomb barmen, the villagers and south Lebanon will suffer death and injury from cluster bombs as they pick their olives in orange years to come. That would teach him a thing or two, I think he can go attack his real life. He may as well do us again no more. 1340 votes on the poll of his scandalous. The biggest name of the best challenge of this is wheel rotors, force radio 560, you and him. Then to palmanor, cover is over this performance by the dolphin. Absolutely. There. Oh, right.

There's your present at the UN. Look at like the bosom they really is talking out of the corner of his mouth like John Cricin. You only wish you had John Cricin. I'll see that right now. When leaders are accountable to the audience. Cricin. Look what you got. Look what we got now on my guy. I'm 13. I'm at full. So I had to love Google list because obviously my yellows useless. We're kind of anything. I said, who's an offence play this week? We're going to lose two. Kind of thing. Oh they're going to get their ass kicked. I know the Patriots played Denver. I think Denver scored what six points suddenly. Sure. Bronco. You know anything is going on beside the freaking dolphins and the teens. The keys and the dolphins, the fish and the swish. So all you know man. So all I know. All you know is Castro went to fish. And his spaghetti brother. That's making her old. Anyway the headline on the stress is. Owen's finger is screwed. And I'm thinking, well wouldn't be the first time. Terrell Owen's man. Terrell Owen's played in the Super Bowl for Philadelphia. Seven weeks after getting a plate and several screws put in his ankle. Now he's hoping another plate and three more screws in his right hand. Let him play against the Eagles on October the 8th. Owen's had a plate screwed into his broken right ring finger during an operation last night. As we covered time is expected to two to four weeks. They selected to do an eye can to rejoin Dallas in 20 days to as much anticipatory turn to Philadelphia. Oh yeah. Cowboys are off Sunday then they played Tennessee before the game against the Eagles. I like to hear his about him. He gives me skill fees man. All of his matches. And for most the piece. But not quite. Forced labor for Palestinian children is really prison. Here you go again. We're going to proper. Yeah. Can't I kiss that to you? A little bit neal. No. No kissy kissy baby. Call of Steve came and see if he can be a little more Jewish. That was one of the great cause in history of talk radio. Steve. Can you be a little more Jewish from some alpha babbage cano down. Many Palestinian children is really tell mom prison are being exploited by forced labor in which they must work eight hours for a few shackles as we've put by the prisoners information center. One of the children may this statement after his release. The prison administration is forced all prisoners in a tell mom prison work eight hours for very low wages. It would not be the Israeli soldiers came to the chambers at seven and forced us to go with our legs tied with chains. The child out of it is jobless to stand under guard in packed plastic spoons and boxes. Even injured political prisoners are forced to work according to Friday's neblis face report. A former prisoner stayed and I had a broken bone but the soldiers forced me out of my cell to work anyway without any consideration for the pain. There are about 375 Palestinians in tell mom prison with most of them being children. The oldest Palestinian in tell mom is 22 years old. The child laborers are given two meals per every 24 hours. The child laborers are given a total of 11 pm and under 6 an a.m. Israeli prison officials also attempt to restrict information from children regarding members of the armed resistance and engaging frequent psychological abuse. According to the information center, there are 200 children less than 16 years old in Israeli prisons being subjected to some of the worst forms of exploitation and emulation. A total of 376 Palestinian children currently imprisoned in Israeli prisons and he's consenting. I'm sure that being abused lightly when you think the should of attack is worth. There you go. That will teach him. Who now see who wrote that? Oh, this is in the bank religious independent news source. No, wait a minute. Does this and then I want to do that? Oh, yeah. That's enough of your anti-Israel propaganda anyway. George puts me up to those anyway. He sends me those stories. No, that's right. That's me. Not. A bravely serving side by side with you against the extremists who want to bring down the free government. You've established. Yeah. Pop. And the fact that he's got five points in a poll now in USA Gallup poll that is about $4.44. What does that tell you? Is Zyna America, baby? You got it. Just like Doug Thompson says, the shame that embarrassed and humiliated. God. Oh, does that hurt about the Pope from the Bangladesh independent news source? I guess I got to say it after the break. He knows very short. I don't want to like rush through it. I'm saying, but I do rush. Oh, I could use some drugs. If I go ahead and said, feel fine. So what's the answer to my question about that account this morning? I was like, yeah. See, this is a thing about him. He's just not in response of you know? It would be one thing if I was asking him to find $100 bills on cherry trees in the backyard or something or $5,000 bills on the back of a orange or a citrus trees. But the fact that a matter is he has very simple questions and you don't get a bad answer. You don't get any answer. That's the QMF in Wade, baby. This guy is no real content. We've been non-composed weeness. He's like that Chinese guy man. Non-composed weeness. No, the biggest name is so the best talent. It's the biggest is we are rockers. Force Radio 560, you A.M. Oh my god, you're breath beautiful. Coming up tonight, uninsigned behind the true Hollywood celebrity music choir for pro-file story. They were the first super group of the 80s. It was an incredibly heavy burden to bear. Although compared to say global warming, not that big a deal. They were Asian. Dang, boy, after the gate, we were number one. But our second album died completely. What happened? That police and Michael Jackson, that's what happened. Sounding member Steve Howe was not prepared for thriller and synchronicity. Two albums that so dominated the 1984 charts as to crush a lesser more annoying band, like Asia. Sting reflects on those heavy days. Well, yeah, we really had a shower. Oh, got you, stinging. You get back here, Steve Howe and basically like a man. For the past 25 years, Steve Howe has been lying in wait for Sting. Never missing an opportunity to pop off from behind the building in Punish him for ruining Asia's Kansas at success. That's where Michael Jackson, howe was carried out a similar systematic plan to tople him in revenge for outselling Asia's sophomore ever. Belly BD, how may I help you? Yes, hello, I'm a bad and innocent boy. And Michael Jackson got me. Who is this? Hello? Well, I guess we better investigate the insane affiliation. Asia, so afraid of lame themselves. They lash out at others. Hey, just like the White House. It's a big juicy, soft-and-mood look at your business tonight. What do you say about Michael's vassal and veteran vesting if he's in his allegations? Is that what he said? Yeah. 1233 at five, 16. He's still hot going to try and take the U.N. Your efforts to come together. And there's condom please, I said no, it would have blanks, some look on her face. Well, and there's John Bolton next to you when I think you're ugly. I'm not saying I'm cookie-duster. Oh my god, what a joke. A state of emergency has been declared should be in the U.S. It's a state of emergency while we're watching this, but in Thailand, and what is why we thought to be military coups for vresses in Bangkok? Tanks have blocked roads surrounding the headquarters of Thailand's government without explanation according to what comes by witnesses. Oh, two bad John Mark Harp and be there to see it. Witnesses are reportedly told new. In fact, he's probably behind us when you think. I'd imagine. Witnesses are reportedly told the news agencies that the tanks inexplicably arrive when the street protests against Prime Minister Thaxin Shienawatra will follow by Army TV broadcast at pictures of the royal family and songs associated with pass military coups. Cool cool coup could chew. At a fair bank account under a severe state of emergency, Shienawatra said that a day from the U.S. or is it the U.N. listening to boys? It should choice as well. That may be it's pretty revolting in itself. Soon after the time military and police announced an arid message to media, they are in control unlike Alexander Hague. I'm in control here at the White House. And if set up a commission for political reform, as unclear, currently whether this means the military believes it sees control exactly in behalf of the Prime Minister's government. Thank you, other sirens at the back here, where even here, they started going off. Shienawatra is planning to return to Bangkok on Thursday. To end the election, scheduled the nation for October 15. You know what happens when there are elections scheduled? I'll help break the loose. First, I can just break the loose between now and November 7. Even though the journey demands courage. On the one of your live before I get to know the thing about the only mean minded religious leader can spread hatred. Before I get to that, your release favored company in the world, I think. Walbert. Yeah. The nation's largest retailer and biggest employer Walmart will begin a program next week. They'll provide voter registration and educational materials to the company's 1.3 million employees. The capital-held newspaper that he'll reports today. The Arkansas-based companies come under fire from labor union, democratic leaders over Asia such as hourly wages, legal status of employees, benefits given to the company's workers, and the fact that there are a bunch of grave robbers. Democratic politicians, including minority leader Harry Reid, have criticized Walmart. And it's personnel policies. Walmart representatives insist that campaign is non-partisan. Walmart's voter registration education programs could be among the biggest in the country. Now, not as big as those of its labor union opponents, the AFLCO, for example, has got nearly 13 million members. The company's decision appears to be a response to several high-profile Democrats in Food and Harry Reid, and 4, 2008 Democratic presidential hopefuls who participate in a labor-organized anti- Walmart campaign this summer, and good for them. Do you go boys, girls? Whatever you might be. What's kind of crazy, don't you go, Pai? He's trying to find the door out. Do you see that? No. She's lost, baby. I think there was something really symbolic about that. She was spinning around in circles. That song will go around in circles. Who did that? No, he'd be impressed. We've been through that before when you got it. I know you can do it. She couldn't find the door out. She couldn't find her ass with your hands at bitch. Condemned and pleased in my ass. Nasty looking Gattooth's like, What a talk of her, very nice. It was actually nice job, you know. I'm sorry, I'm too much for hands. Okay, she was spinning around in circles like a, like a drail. Wrong holidays sweetheart. That's the Chanukah time, bitch. 1390s we vote's maintenance audience is just all brawled and burdened together. The show continues and hell, by the way. That's my punishment. No, my punishment is the show continues and hell. I can read no more articles. I got to take all four hours a day. Hey, Miguel Bielosen, he'll be there. Today we'll make sure that. Today we'll make sure that all the anti-cancer people go to hell. That's probably what there's not an indigene. There'll be a leader's lunch. But I mean, but I'm sure that they're not going to be in their falafel together. Only a mean minded religious leader can spread hatred rights to somebody. Does it even have a name on it? No, it's just a natural and bank with issues. New the new nation newspaper. It said the best we'd be like among Muslim back is what have been just to ignore them, contenturously for their insanity. But that's not the way religious people react. Oh, good religious people, right? They kill some people. One may differ and say that if anti-Muslim or outside of be taken so rationally, then the religious suffer of lost its appeal and deeper meanings. What are the deeper meanings? The remarks of the head of the Roman Catholics worldwide, Pope Benedict XVI, is facing anger of Muslims all over the world over the Resurmarcians Islam. Maybe the other phones ring again, but tell me another package. Maybe the Pope has been used taking advantage of his ignorance when he said Not from his own knowledge or conviction, according a 14th century visiting emperor, showed just what Muhammad brought that was new and there were fine things only even in human, such as the command spread by the sword the faith he preached. What is most in the manices that a head of religion had a quote an ancient emperor to make the ragnature of Marx against another religion. The Pope could have relied on his own knowledge of religions and speak about the virtues of his own religion. No wonder many are attacking his ignorance in any mode of behind such reference to one ancient visiting emperor said about Islam. It is natural that Muslim anger is growing at the Pope's point. Muslims demand an apology from him for an ancient Islam comments. It announced the issue that Pope Benedict XVI never intended any offensive Muslim religion. The truth is many well-meaning ignorant persons have done many evils over long history of mankind. The world has to catch them to watch them carefully and stop them before it's too late. Stop them. What must not be ignored is that Muslims are brave people and they can't do the second largest religion in the world. Across the Middle East and the Middle East, Muslims must not be taken lightly. If the world has to be made a safe place to people belonging to other religions must learn to be civilized with Muslims, Islam is a religion of peace. But at the same time Islam is against injustice and servitude. Muslims will fight state terrorism. We can send them in our helpful state as militarily. Watch out for that Vatican army, baby. That's wish guard. It says conspiracy against Islam is a wrong path for peace. Those who are following the wrong path are paying a heavy price. It says, sounds like an asshole of veiled shred to me from people who know their veils. In fact, I think their favorite singer is Jerry Veiled. 1403, oh, that phone's ringing again. The biggest name of the best talent for the existence of the real rotors, the squash radio 560, 18M. A-B-L-U-M. A-B-L-U-M. Back in the day when someone done a strong, we didn't take their grime.

And not embarrassed to be in America, where we take free all of it, we, we have a flag in one hand, with our head in the south, if lightly followed the power that he had the head take. And I thought the bread can go. Watching states from you, on a 65-inch screen, scratcher, five, everything's okay. It's thanks to Paul Scott, he's been changing us.

The not the entire bacterial one. No, could be the entire bacterial anything man. It causes bacteria. I have to. I have to scrubbing. But this is also not those things in it. Oh, does it? Yeah. I like that. I just blew. I heard I'll look and see what it is. It's blue and it's got like, it's like a kind of a medium blue and it's got dark blue little moisture beads in it. It does it make you smell like a fruit. No. Get out of here. When I wear stuff like that. I have to cut. The hump or five to six. And then that doesn't make you smell like a fruit. What's an apricot? The dev doesn't make you smell like one. That's a joke. No, it's not. The hump or five to six to three five. More. Paralympans on deck. Or actually get a big audience. More listen. So the scene just about over thank God. They're going to have a job that gave it a heck of a shot. And they fell a little bit short. That's all like that Chinese guy. They were a little bit short.

Sour losers may like the Leafs lost their first exhibition game in the Buffalo Fourth� Lies. That I sat here. Sick is a dog. Watchin' a whole thing. They stunk. I complain about it today. You bet. They stink. It says if seven ninety the ticket was looking to capture the moot of South Florida. Oh, this is all about seven ninety. This ain't about us. They're the little hammer in there. A little hammer, huh? What do you eat now? Put a pig. Oh, cookie. If seven ninety the ticket was looking to capture the moot of the river. Another. Another one bites to us by Queen. Oh, Queen. You're fairie. You're a tax. And all of a sudden. Crap. So went today at Miami Sports Talk Radio Station where fans called into moron lament. And I said the most disastrous combined stuff for the sports weekend. And remember that other one man went ahead to a big game so it wasn't that long ago either. And her canes got their ass whipped and it often is lost bad. So you can, uh, a big deal. And the mar ones blew the forward league in the strike. They were at seven or three in the, uh, what love and thinning. Punish. Ten to 11. Next ritnings. And then theanya squared five runs in the bottom. grotesque error and embrace kick the rest all bad. It says some fans were able to vent directly to their team such as those who booed down a cult that friend that opens on Sunday and he played another neat game to me. Especially that nice interception there near the end. Or the lone fan would be stopped by polices. He would be rated you. Oh, I see. Be rated you. I'm athletic director Paul B. after the hurricane's loss at Louisville on Saturday. This is South Florida. Maybe if you don't win every game we hate you. Yeah, it's so perfect man. It is perfect for others that was sports radio WQM56. You don't have to remember us. I'm glad that whoever this show is Brian Costa. Remember the fact that that we, you know, we got like 50,000 times their audience. And seven ninety the ticket which has a working relationship with a hero. Oh, I see. Hellkilling. No Schmidt. Could have fooled me. Not callers in and day to the stations with complaint on issues ranging from U.M. Coach Larry Crocker's job. So this is only 100 years old. How old is he? My young buddy. Or so. 96 to when the dolphins off-est of where they're Mike Malarky should direct the offensive on the side line of the coaches. But that sounds like a bunch of Malarky to me. Larry Crocker is very business like him. I don't like that. So John Lupo 40 you know QAM. Jesse Limmon 25 talking about call pepper on the ticket said the guy looked like a schmuck. What kind of a comment is that? Is that some kind of a racial remark? He didn't say what color schmuck. Oh, I see. Michael's here really 40 set of the dolphins. It's terrible. It's terrible. Oh, you know what that reminds me of? What? It's terrible. Oh. It's just these guys. Nick and Johnson, whatever the heck it is. And the people I call it. They just like them. I like that they were on the, what a court. The weeds in their high and they're. I mean it's terrible. He is at up and look at listening to six of them. Oh, and now this year. What's it under? Oh, what's the under Nip in suds? I thought you were asking me what was that popping and fuking in the call. Oh, Nip and suds got it. Got it. The call is represented only a tiny fraction of all fans. And of course, you didn't turn fans loosely because in South Florida, you can't find very many real fans just about to, yeah, yeah. For actually most of this drop fraction, but there were nothing the money to keep to talk shows. Lively it says John Co. Pope will coproduce his ankle over his afternoon show on QAM. So the volume of calls Monday was high in vertical day after it often lost. We don't even have to ask for calls to give about the number of co. Said, well, guess what? We don't on this show either. Before going on the air, several colleagues had sports radio was a form of therapy for them. A place to release kind of frustration after any depression weekend. So I'm just going to stop you. No tickets today. Yeah. This is their lives. Okay. What do you people trying to say? I know that. It's that isn't the most pathetic thing. Who do I go to? Tommy Bush in 53 said, well, wait me go on the ticket. Wayne He's not going to listen. Who do I go to? Because your team sucks. Go to hell. One fan called Rose, although it didn't say Joe just rose. Isn't like Rose soldier like it's the first name. Joe rose on the swimming. And we're mad at listeners was only football and said, South Florida said, just enjoy watching it. Could be in a bunch of babies. Yeah, it never says Joe rose at a point in here. And all of a sudden, here's just rose. Yeah, though. Where does it say that before I did I read Joe rose? He skipped over it. Get out of here. It doesn't say, oh, yeah. Joe rose began. South Florida Great Depression continues. Long fan, another car of the Rose show began by seeing him on the beach. It was gloomy and continuing to go herely for about a minute before Rose got them off. We're going to have to put that guy in suicide watch. Rose produces that cranscript off the air. He watched your backpack. Let's see. But we put it up for nothing interesting. And that's the volume of calls to light of the radio stations. But the level of criticism became exhausting even for the host to agree with it. As he left the ticket studio after a show Monday rose rubbed his hand across his forehead and exhale, I can only do so much negative stuff he said I really can't. I mean, he won't be over there very long. That whole experience over there is pretty negative. He wants out of there. I'm here in. Well, we did hear that. Remember, of course, maybe not anymore. But right. Who was it he was shooting with real band? He was shooting with somebody. That's a target. Oh, is Dan Lobaster that he didn't have a light poison? Well, anybody that doesn't have Dan Lobaster's got to be an idiot. Which is why that's when we dropped the boisterman. When we discovered that those two were really, really tight.

Arar. The idol of a guy that they said to Syria, you know, I didn't talk about him. Well, something needs to be said. I just know that you're saying a lot about it here. He's something. I know what I can say. Okay. You've been back a lot, I haven't been here. It's been a long time. I've been waiting for you. I'm tired. I'm tired. Just wait. Maybe I can do it. I've got children. I've got children. I've got children. I've got children. I've got children. I've got children. I've got children. I've got children. You're a woman. You're a woman. I'm a man. You're a woman. I'm a woman. I'm a woman. I'm a woman. Anybody who tells me that isn't a great element. Their taste isn't their tool. Wouldn't no music from my elbow, okay? You've got to be kidding me. Where'd it go if I let the bellmons? I have mad. I may be on the floor in a second. This isn't a fantastic tool, man. I've got to have a... Come on. Come on. That's all I got, sir. Come on. That's a T. That's all I got. That's just all the T. What was here? Sixty-61. I don't know. Sixty-one. Doesn't say. No, no, no. Go rule a bellmons. I don't know what it is. Something about that. Some of that stuff matters. Love it. Maybe one of the bellmons looks pretty good. I don't know because the answer is don't. But anyway. As for the people who get out of a man who can maybe be officials, now say it was falsely accused of being tied while cut and ended up being deported from the west, since a Syria and tortured there for 10 months, say he cried Tuesday relief when he learned that his name had been cleared. Still, my life has been ruined. Syrian born Maher Ara 3056, yesterday. I call on the government who can't do accept the findings of this report and hold people accountable. He added according to the global mail. The government commissioned to be on the case of Ara ex-undervamed him of all terrorist activity and urged the federal government to offer financial compensation. I say give them 50 million 62 million? No, I was close. That's just 61. There you go. If you're within a year, it's of counts. You're good. True. A raw claims he was victim of a extraordinary rendition or the U.S. transfer for a terrorist suspects to third countries without court approval. Here we go with this crap again. Okay? I'm able to say categorically, there was no evidence to indicate that Mr. Arawis committed any offense or that is activities constituted the threat to the security of Canada. The mystery of Dennis O'Connor said in the three vital report on the findings of the inquiry, only part of which was made public. The report finds that Arawis lived through a nightmare that included being tortured at the hands of the Syrian military intelligence. He's a software engineer who was traveling out of Canadian passport when he was detained in New York's Kennedy Airport. September 26, 2002, during a stop over in his way home to Canada from vacation to Nija. Arawis said he was the 37th of the Syria for interrogation as they suspected Al-Qaeda member and allegations he denied. He spent nearly a year in prison in Syria. After his release in 2003, he made detailed allegations about extensive interrogation, beatings and weapons with electrical cable in Syria in prison. So, if not, I'll also criticize the U.S. and recommended an out of a foul formal protest with both Washington and the Syrian government over a virus treatment. The U.S. is already under intense criticism from human rights groups over the practice of rendition of suspects to countries where they could be tortured, where they will fear you. U.S. in Syrian officials refused to cooperate with the Canadian inquiry, how surprising. The Commission found the Royal Canadian mounted police, the RCMP, shared information about Arawis with American anti-terrorist agencies, both before an afternoon was detained. Among other things, the RCMP strongly described Arawis to the Americans' and Islamic extremist perspective being linked to the Al-Qaeda terrorist network. The force also described him as the target of domestic anti-terrorist investigation in Canada when in fact he was a peripheral figure who had come out of suspicion only because he had been seen in the company of another man who was under surveillance. O'Connor concluded the inaccurate information passed by Canadian police, the U.S. authorities very likely lived in the 1970s Syria. It is quite clear that the RCMP sent inaccurate information to U.S. officials Arawis said I wouldn't have even been sent to Syria to send information I would give to them. How you like that? Hello. For Off-Mid or whatever his name is, Mahah Mahu-Mahar, Phil-Mahar, Phil-Mahar, Arawar. You're right about Phil-Mahar man. He sent it to Torp with all that pancake line. Such a little over-made up Torp looks like an orange head. I'd like to take it seriously and see, and that's the problem. Is that when you agree with somebody, whatever they say and you know that person has no credibility because they're such a jackass and such a Torp. You know what's like? What's it like?

Yeah, yeah, when he dangled like kid, I thought to myself, here's Michael Jackson all over again, you know? Yeah. Fifteen hundred, thirty one votes on the poll there. Fifteen, thirty one. Muslim, say, Pope's apology, I could have fired away. Just in case you think that the word thing is what? What apology? I haven't heard one yet. Well, he said he was, he said he was sorry that they were offended. He didn't say he was sorry he said it. That's what he said. That's what he said. That's what he said. If you say I'm sorry I said it or I'm sorry I did it. That's an apology. Right. If you say I'm sorry you're offended by it, that's nothing to do with the apologizing. That's what I say. And this garbage about how well, you know, he was quoting from somebody else. They didn't misbe, we flagged his feeling. Well, I don't have my, how did he read the quote? Huh? How many, how many, how many, three in post-coordial you've read from all these Islamic Hachas? Huh? Not thirty million. And he picks one up that says, well, you know, a bunch of our variants and what could you say you're not saying that every time that it hasn't. You know, he picked And seven-in-one. I haveamid bring and, you know, killing people with a sword and, uh, make them an refer to it couldn't refuse, I thought that was a Catholic thing. Making people an offer. They couldn't refuse. That's right. Perfect. You know, something. I got, I got the evidence right here. Here it is. I want to make them an offer again. Quality Definitely charge them well. What a thing! In fact, Clemens, it was there with the overcooked mishak-ton. Muslims in Turkey are rackin' the Palestinian territories demanded two day that Pope Benedict XVI and the Nazi Pope were those BDIs. He really does look evil. Make a clear apology for his remarks on Islam instead of saying one of them that he was deeply sorry that Muslims had taken offense. So here we've got two groups of crazy people at war. How unusual, however, would just wars? Something new, huh? Yeah, they've heard of it. The Prime Minister of Malaysia, which chairs the world's biggest Muslim blocks said that Benedict XVI's expression regret was acceptable. So you don't like him, but they said it's okay. But in Turkey, protest is said Benedict must make full of men's before a plan to remember trip that would be his papaces first visit to a Muslim nation and if the XVI, their way also is last. Either a apologizer is not come or to ban a carried by group name and straightest from a religious worker's union. Either a apologizer is not come. I think that's what one of the altar boys told him too, but nevertheless, I could expand on that, but Jewish should have it over his breakdown. The rest parliament also rejected Benedict XVI's explanation of his remarks saying it was insufficiently clear. The parliament demands the Pope take practical steps to restore respect to the Islamic world and its religion and it curses a apology for what he said, a lawmaker said in the statement where the press conference. The top Muslim clergyman in the Palestinian territory similarly demanded a advantage of going for a clear apology, the mostly of Jerusalem, all the mostly, Mohammed Hussein. Let's take, let's come up with all the different Islamic names, okay, there's Mohammed Hussein, who's saying, okay, Osbar, who's saying what? Who's saying what? It's right. What's he going to do? It's like only seven names. No. Anyway, Mohammed Hussein was Palestinian to all the attacks on churches and the territories, but held upon if he's possible for the outpouring of anger. He should know that we get pissed off easy, I think is what he's trying to say. So far we considered the apology of the Vatican Pope in sufficient who's saying to a reporters, we firmly asked the Vatican Pope to offer a personal, public and clear apology of the one and a half billion Muslims in this world. Here's the quote again, the pot of said that a medieval text that characterised some of the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed has evil and inhuman especially his command is spread the sword by the sword of the faith, okay? And the correct answer, certainly not the one about he had a point, he has no business talking about this. There is not nobody even close, nobody even close to the Catholic Church when it comes to religions, killing people. See here, look at this, here's a facts add. No more cold calls to indicate your next marketing campaign with, this is a great question. I'm going to be looking for the little part of time activity here. Especially the way this sales department is going, man, just in fact, you know something I think it's appropriate. I want you to look at what you have a copy of the log, Miguel's got it. Yeah, I got it. He's got the log. Look at the last break coming up here. Wow, out of things. Granted, this is the first time in my life I've seen a form in a break which is the limit thanks to my contractor. They'd be running in 10 minutes, five times an hour. It's the first form in a break that's got three, seven units in it. Seven units, excellent programming. I was going Chris, although Chris, I was told this morning by your friend Clarence of Kristen, the cell, those five hours cost, ABC, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, what a series of just unbelievable blunders and missteps. Let me say it again, like I said last week, Joel, the only reason you people are even still in business is because the incompetence of the crews that run this joint. That's the only reason you're still even in existence, plus daddy's money. 1538 votes on the pool. Oh, Iraqi Prime Minister demands that the judge in the Sun shall be replaced. That was on the internet, it's about two hours ago. And she had been saying, just in. So, that he had gone choose to don't who's saying to ask him for help to help him find his family. At that point, Saddam Hussein responded to the witness saying, if I was a six-chater, why are you coming to me at which point did I? Judge, did you not admit it? I don't know what happened to Saddam Hussein was not addicted. You know, in the soul of news, okay, I don't even judge also with somebody made him an alcoholic. He couldn't refuse, you think? If you're not a dictator, son of a good guy, you just misunderstood that song. This misunderstood, never sold a freight train and things were so much better when you were at the head, right? Right. I think it was one of those Johnny Dolan's things. They both thought about the head together one day and so on. Nice goods. For 1538, baby, 1538, most religious people are full of crap. That's basically what a bull's down do. And if you don't want to believe me or the audience out there, just take a look around and sniff a baby. No, 50's name. No, no, no, no. Tell us if it exists, we all rocked for a guy. For a guy, for a radio, 560, issue a M. When it comes to school, we're not going to go away now. We are the authority. What the hell is that?
