All right, Neil's back. Yeah. You on better? No, little bit. What's up with you? The blood pressure, high blood pressure, band headaches. I was going to love that I got up this morning, but then the last hour and a half. A lot of idiots coming in there. Yeah. Troy's transferred. Clarence. Oh. And so now by the time I'm here with him, I'm ready to go back to bed. Don't let it get you. Yeah. What you told me, just think about that check. Yeah. If you, if you'd have been in the same position as I was Friday night at Pompano Park, finding out that they're trying to like, extort money from your clients, you wouldn't have been too happy about it either. You were even off. They were not. Oh, Pompano had a problem with us. Oh, no. They have a problem that died in Nobby. That's okay. At least they crawled on them. Go stream our call over last week, closing weekend. Yeah. Nobody called them to get copy. That's because the places in total state of dysarray. I hate to sound negative, but the places in case you haven't noticed is in a total state of dysarray. No matter what the question is like, well, who's the general manager this week? I don't know. I don't know. No matter what they are the week is it. I don't know. You know. So yeah, we're trying to squeeze five grand out of Pompano to like fund this best of Neil 30th anniversary CD, which we're not going to have one by the way. It wasn't my idea in the first place. But nobody ever bothered to tell me about that. And I told Steve Wolf, I said, if you people paid out money, I'm going to be so pissed off. I said, don't do it. Cancel it. And they did. Can you imagine that? What a millions of dollars in damage that they just had there and just, you know, missed a month of racing and they're trying to like put their whole program back together again. And, you know, and they just go and put the full court press. Let's slow them off here. I've only had them on for 30 years. They, you know, to the let's spot go away. Yeah, it's not like we were oversold here. And that's, you know, you just don't get that money back. Steve, you were right. Like I told you last week, you sure had your thumb on it about him. Yeah, why? No question. So, yeah, ghosting opens today. Well, I hope you'll be a good talker betting it. I will not be there. Oh, no, I said it called him. I know, I'm done. I opening day card is brutal. Eight races. In fact, I noticed I read in the paper because I was there for the three days over the weekend and believe you me, I don't want to come back there anytime soon. But they're encouraging people to go to call their advanced stream because I wanted to see the places and finish yet and we want you to be disappointed. Well, it's their smart that way. You know, I took the tour on Saturday and it's, you know, it's going to be a, you know, it's going to be a, the slot and forium is going to be incredible. There are a lot of seats facing the race track. There's probably a good idea. Yeah, right. Why would you want to see the race? It's the upper right. So, you know, they've got this big centerpiece walking circle that's behind the building that is spectacular looking, but it's, you know, they're going to, you sit there and watch races on big monitors. And, you know, the Simon cast rooms. It's all about that. Yeah, I think they only have about three or four thousand seats that actually, well, that's a race track. That's enough. Yeah. Well, some days. But it'll be nice. I'm not going to judge it. Let people live up the other people do that. See how they like it. That's right. Go out there and tundra and go to that. Yep. And please go to Pomp and O Park because they got any free to cost to that five grand that they were not going to pay, but they might have had to pay. I wonder how many. I got the literature because Steve will give it to me. So I have the evidence. It's really scary. I'm going to talk about this on the show today. It's just, it's frightening to me. And I'm nothing about this. Absolutely nothing. I didn't either. So is that Troy's a counter? Yes. Oh, he was in there for 50 minutes. It's more in front of me as stroke. Troll. I have a book. I have a book. But I have a book. But I have a book. But I have a book. But I have a book. But I have a book. So I take back what I've already said. I'll, you know, about Troy's dread for a nice guy. Just another sales guy. So I think like, Gostry, what we ought to do is say, hey, all you, radio people out there, all you listening to is somebody else. Go over to 790 and try them. We'll let you know. We'll start running maybe an ad campaign. We'll run a sandwich board. Maybe we'll get one of those planes that flies the message like Jeff Cohen does. Those banner planes. Okay. And the coast is clear. You can come back now. We've got our act back together again. We know what we think we don't what we're doing. It's amazing to me. It's just astonishing. I went and advertised our mind on Sunday. I'm beginning to feel like the people I'm endorsing. I want to go see them to make sure everything's okay. Yeah. Well, no, I'd start to see. As I have no idea how many more of these things have been passed out and how much more money to try to restore it from sponsors. I get the feeling that the company is trying to make it into a money grant for themselves. Like, remember that online auction they had that embarrassment? I, uh, remember that? This is your time, we're on the ground. I said, what the hell's that all? He says, oh, well, it's another revenue stream for the company. Yes, it's stream on this. Yeah. Stream my ass. Mr. Company man. Well, by the way, the coal miners, they're all still alive. It was a mistake. First they were alive. Yeah. Not about that. Now we're going to say they were alive again. Oh, they are? They told them. They told the families now that, oh, we made a mistake. They're dead. Yeah. They're always. They died. Yeah. Yeah. It's not fun. And we're supposed to be whipped up into a frenzy about that. There's people dying all over the place every day. But this is the TV event, do you, you know? Like the other day it was the fires in Oklahoma. Hour after hour after hour. Thank God there was a lot of football games on us on our container. Yeah. Lots of games to bet on. Yeah. Not a good pick on a dolphin-patre game, by the way. No, well, I didn't know the place where any SPN Saturday morning or was it Sunday. When we went to bed day. Well, you know something, I didn't know the Brady was going to play a quarter. And in Bill, I just got the nerve to get as much as I love him. He's got the nerve to come on and say, well, we didn't take that game. How could anybody say that? They told me they picked the starters for one quarter. And the fact that they have fluency do that drop here. That's a tell you how seriously they did. They didn't want to see Pittsburgh in the first round. That's what that was all about. I'll guarantee you that when that kid came off from a day after they scored the last touchdown, and we were a couple of seconds left. Yeah. And the kid met Castle, whatever his name is, quarterback. He went over to the sideline and you're a team of ballets. I told him if you complete this past, don't ever show up here again. The guy was open. Yeah. He was wide open. Yeah. And he overthrew him by like 10 yards. Yes. Then what ball was it close to him? Now, who would you rather play Pittsburgh, which is what I'm saying? Well, they got in the last. Jacksonville, which is like, you know, got a good record, but they basically a girl's team. Uh, we'll see. But they, you know, they definitely didn't want to see Pittsburgh. It was no question about that. And now they will see Pittsburgh either because. And you notice in the frame, the second quarter after they took Brady out and the starters, the crowd started getting really pissed off. And I don't blame them, you know. If you're going to take a game and not play the starters, don't don't turn. You give people a rebate. You'll give them money back. Those people have been loyal for a long time. Yeah. Right. Good luck with that. Yeah. So anyway, I picked up the paper today and lead on the Penn State. Game is in Florida State. Two old men shared a late night out. And I'm thinking, it's me and Eddie Kaplan. Yeah. So big and a old man. I'm so glad you brought that up. Now, this Joe Pa, what's he ever liked him in the first place? He just, I just hadn't said about him in noise me. But his behavior on the sideline, if it was any other coach, anywhere in the US, he would have gotten kicked out in the first quarter, but it kicked his ass off the field. He's like a half a step away from what he has. He behaves like a crazy person. He's been like that for a couple of years. He's a single play. He's swearing and screaming. And the veins are popping out of his forehead. He's a crazy person. I mean, I really don't hear the damn what you guys think. That's him. That's him. Crazy person. Well, I learned something the other day when I was watching the Notre Dame game in high definition. I kept reaching the Interpet and Brady Quinn on a shoulder, tried to give him some encouragement, but they were outman. Yeah. But I learned something that Woody Hayes claimed that he never played Notre Dame, never put him on a schedule, because he didn't want to divide the Ohio Catholics or what are these? Well, a lot of that. But our top out there is that's such a freaking lie. Right. Man. You know, these empire building coaches, you know, the bear Bryant and Bobby Bowdman, and he said, I'm going to get a life already. Will you please? What is that all about? That is their life. That's pretty sad. Very sad. Well, I'm glad you're feeling better. No, I'm pretty good this morning. And now my head is, I might just go back to bed. I mean, I did the crossover. We had a pretty good time here this morning. I might just go back to bed. Yeah. I'll do the rest of the show. Until they stop bugging the craft. Sure. Sure. You're there. Thank God for him being here yesterday because there's no way I could've done that show. Yeah. I had a trip back here from from hell. Oh, that's another thing. I don't know if you fly for a lot of day or my own year for it. For a lot of day. That was my first experience there in years. Now coming in, it was okay on Friday. It was fine. But I came back. It's my bed. Although it may be it's like this every day. But I came back. What the hell day that I come back? Monday. Monday. Monday. Saturday. Busy a stay or the year. Oh my god, that place was a manhouse. Yeah. And then you go through security and they had this zigzag line that just zigz and zagz and it goes on forever when you think is there ever any security check it or is this just a joke. Man. And that place was just they have too many flights. I was in terminal for air Canada. And they have too many damn flights. Like every five feet and other flight they got like four seats. You know? And everybody is standing and milling around my flight was an hour late because of which was an hour late because of incoming was an hour delayed because of mechanical. And I'm like wandering around or wondering like here's San Juan and here's Montego Bay and here's Jamaica Mon and etc. Speaking of Jamaica Mon, speaking of Jamaica, you know that there's a population of Jamaica of two million people and there are many murders they had last year. How many? 1630. The bees who make this population? The bees who's having house down there. Huh? Did you know the bees who have a house there? Go on, let's take a place for them. I found me figured out what to do, making it as like the best. A good machine gun. Man. People always said hi, crime rate. A good machine gun. Yeah, they like care kiln each other. And anyway, have a great day. Don't lose too much and they're opening day card. You know, you got to like see that. I will not be. I'm not gambling today. Come on. What kind of what kind of spirit is that? They need your money. That's what horses are hungry man. They're having a soft opening might they call it. Yeah. I know some people like that. I'll be outside today. That's what I heard about screw in. I wouldn't know, but I'm saving myself for Saturday. Okay. Okay. What Saturday? That's when I'll be going back to the operation until Saturday after today. Oh, I see. Now, are we going to have spots on promoting this or not? Uh, I don't think they're advertising. Ha ha ha ha. A Gulf stream. Gulf stream is not running a lot of advertising. Oh, I see. They don't want people there. Right. Until they get there. They're all the way. Hey, listen, all your people out there. Gulf stream opens today, but don't go there. Whatever you do. And last year, they gave the other station the budget, which makes me think they want people there last year either. Yeah. And I'm sure they succeeded very well. Have a great day. Thank you. And I'll call you from bed. Hope you feel in better. See ya. Oh, God, you're breath so beautiful. The nature yet act to still on the ground. The government is still in your face. They go bend those where it's all belong. So they can't eat, drop on you. All these things will rise to go away. They can put a camera in your room. Our four fathers wouldn't be surprised. We're all leading the graves now. Now you'll know what's actually going to do it right. To move your finger on right. With the free and full name whites behind. Back home. Okay, church, to her stuff. But my friend, my family now chied up. My gold daughter can be fast. But I've heard my tea day can be too fast. Get a fruit and a stand. Boots are round and they're in the place. I can't do it. So find out what is life. To have no pride in his life. Abu Gara, 1013, 560, W. Wednesday, January to 4th. My first show of the New Year. You've said it about that or what? Well, I'm not. I'm a little scared, actually. Why is that? Because I'm afraid that you might fall over any minute. I just might act to you. You know, if those people, I'm going to make the body guard the audio from now on. Okay, if Doug Kozina is okay, because he's supposedly selling the show, which is about time somebody does. But if those other people come in like the sales holes or Clarence, especially if you just come get out. I just leave the old man. That's right. When you were your witness to it, like about an hour and nine stop aggravacinous morning. Yeah. And I put all my fingernails off the whole while. Were you really? Yeah. It's probably the choice thing. I could just hear, you know, your blood pressure. Well, I finally got involved out. I went made my vehicle. I microwave bacon. I just couldn't take no more. You're not fooling anybody. Troy, all you are just another sales holder wants to take the money and stuff in your pocket, which we all got to eat. You know, it's fine. But that's it. Everything I have to do is for him. And what am I going to drive a Corvette? Oh, oh, oh, yeah. You're an idiot, Troy. You're just a skin-headed idiot. And I hope you and the sales manager have a great life together. Maybe he and the Curtis can loop. And that's Curtis Raymond Burr by the way. I don't want anybody to think we're talking about Curtis Stevenson, who we like a lot. Who's a good guy who's on the year. But this is our salesman, the back there, who's a very thin skin and very uptight and doesn't communicate with a talent because he can't handle it and because he's drowning in a sea of incompetence.

In an isolated region of the West, comes the heartwarming story everyone is talking about. What started as a fishing trip, became something much more. The chicken, chicken, all-in-oh, it stars in. Broken back, mountain. What's up? What's up? What's up? How? The brook's way back. I can't move. Hello? Hello? Oh. Damn. The critics are raving about broken back, mountain. It's about a man with a broken back. On a mountain. I think that was a wolf. That was a grizzly. Oh my, I'm lost. Now where am I? That sounded like a homosexual. Oh my goodness. You're heart. Yeah. Definitely homosexual. Throw back mountain, ready to ask for extreme stupidity. Now I'm sure you need to want to see that. Yeah, that's good one. Come on. No. We have a little bit to take. I can speak for Josh. You might have seen it. Yeah. I think Josh, I'd twice feel like it's so much. Anyway, here's your poll from here's my poll from yesterday. Right. So then I want you to take and credit for it. It's all yours. Because I was all set to come in yesterday, but boy, so sick for that. And it would long overdue for a few sick days. Like today sounds good. Oh. Was that just talking not too long ago, but it's been at least a couple of years since. I had even one sick day. That's right. Well, just live up for the end. I feel like it might be the end. That's why I felt, let's see, two last night. Don't let the people be here. That's true. That's true. I'm very sure. I'm voting for sale on the poll. I like that. That's why I put it on there. I see Moan is wife and voted nine times of peace. Why is America so much in the guns? Why is it the American as well? That's one. 14, 126 votes. They love my poll man. I may be old and fat and a fatty and stale, but they love my poll. Why is America so much in the guns? It's the American effort way. Maybe 622. I'll ride and you'll ride it is. But they're exporting it up here too. It's part of our culture, 1951. Because they're basically violent, 146. They don't trust each other, 138. Americans are just scared, schmittless, one-on-one. Where would that one come from? Was that one of my choices? Uh, someone called it a subalcoholic. Yeah, I'm adding here. Because they can be 89. They don't trust the government 72. They sure beat Boson-Aro's 48. Yeah, I'll take my gun. If you're doing it, I was most of the days of the week. And they left Chuck Heston, movies 11. How do you like that? Well, he had to tremendous impact. You was son of a bitch. On America, he's dressed like a nice spanned ex-pants. And he goes bottling away. Oh, yeah, it was on again the other night, Furnit 911. Cool. And everybody got to be forced to watch it. They ought to be forced to a toothpick's in their eyes to sit back. But they won't. And they don't care. And they're all worried about the, uh, the coal miners in West Virginia. Who were alive and then they were dead. And now they're still dead. But who knows, maybe next time they'll be alive again. It's like magic. Or speaking of magic. Oh, my God. You know, Bob Hamilton, you are a happy Christ. Oh, my God. You know, Bob Hamilton, you are a happy Christ. Oh, my God. You know, Bob Hamilton, you are a happy Christ. So if evidence here, Troy, I'm going to rip you an ass and your buddy Curtis Raymond, whatever his name is, Bert, he's going to have burrs in his saddle by the time I get through. What a scam. Every no matter what you involved in with this company, it terms into a scam. And additionally, which a bad scam, you know, it's one thing to be a good scam, or just like Jack Abram off of lease for a while anyway. Oh, good. Yeah. What the, isn't it, isn't it convenient? Isn't it convenient for these talking head channels? That we got the coal mine disaster now. I think I'm 95% of the time, as supports to talk about Jack Abram off of total in Tom Delay. And what's the other guy's name from Ohio? Bob Beney. Mm-hm. Just take a ball of time talking about the coal mining disaster. And last couple days ago, it was the fire, the wildfires in Oklahoma and Texas. And the, the plane with emergency landing at Logan in Boston. It's always something that we get out in for our after hour. So we don't have to talk about this other stuff. All these crooks in Washington. And this latest business, they're saying, I'm actually going back to the executive branch. What I say, up to 200 people might be tainted by the light. Taint the lie either man, bad news. So here's today's pool that we're doing. I'm starting to feel like my left hand is a little tough. I just said that for your own. No, it's true. A little bit just a little touch. No, I'd have it a heart attack. Since carrots was well done. You weren't always well done here in there. My phone was ringing out at the end of the boat. It is probably just showed up downstairs. I might just go and get it, you know, or not. I'm not going to sample it on here because. I'm not going to go into it. There are so many loose ends, you know, just hanging all over the place. And it's like, oh, well, we don't know nothing. We don't know. And nobody tells us anything. You know, carrots is one thing to go through life as a total quizzling. It's another thing to open up a mouth. Have little parables and say, you know, what's the story here? What's going on? Greg. But haven't had any of the buildings. It's got the cones to do that. Here today's pool. We did this long time ago and a year ago as a matter of fact. And but back then, it only let a couple of choices, you know, like three choices. And I thought, well, let's give them a lot more bad choices. Give them a chance for a cheap shot. Even though they're all listening, of course, or they wouldn't be on our website. The roger is very entertaining 170 out of 408. For a five, whatever it hell with is, a voice of reason 85. A genius 55. Yeah, can't you tell? A freaking genius. A fat or all-fag 42. Well, there's no debating that. That's why I voted that. Our panic 27. That's what I voted because I find myself most amusing. Our panic 27. A laugh riot. Steel 18. So that's more than as why voting nine times each. Divisive five. Burying four and a bigot one. Yeah, there you go. There's a little something for everybody on there, right? The people that voted boring, man. Yeah. It's boring. Hold on. But there's no way to what choice you put on there. You're going to get something. That's why I put them on there. I think I'm not as exciting as most of the people of Call of Radio talk. I was like, to once you had on Monday. Oh, it's you. I'm five here. Yeah. I was in transit. No, anyway, that's the four-loaded earlier. I'm kind of debating whether I ever want to fly out of the organ. And Hank is right. It is the busiest probably. That and thanksgiving you know, the two busiest days of the years for his flying. Yeah. But that that place was a zoo just insane. And they got like 7,000 different flights all the parting from the same terminal air. And they're all like about 10 feet apart. And they got all these long lines. And everybody's in a total state of panic. And seriously, they got about 15 seats for, well, my flight was sold out. So there was like 170 people on my flight. Well, how can 170 people stick their fan ass in the, you know, 15, 20, 30 seats? But turn man. Huh? Yeah. Can't do it. Well, if he's in everybody's milling all around. So finally, you know, the planes an hour coming in an hour late leaving. And they finally start boarding the flight and they put the ginseng. You know, of course it's for a lover. They'll say, it's got to be at least two few wheelchairs. And they start to load them out. Well, you know, once they put the ginseng, it means they're going to have pre-boarding. And it momentarily. Right. So unlike aircanted in Miami, international, which is always very orderly and very calm and very, you know, or in a person the same way, no chaos. And all of a sudden, here come all these idiots pushing forward line. I thought, oh, she's having Europe again. This is like, hail on part two. Or you were, you were, when I came back from Amsterdam, even here by my KL and D. Oh, I'm 47. I mean, I have to repeat it all over again. And about getting on a plane after this chaotic insane boarding. And, oh, ladies and gentlemen, they, one of the, uh, uh, carts, one of the call is the catering trucks. One of the catering trucks hit the plane this morning. And maintenance failed. I noticed that there was a damage to the aircraft. So we're all going to have to offload the plane, get your luggage. And we got a number of 747 at the gate next door. And that was, that was that. Traveling is becoming a real pain in the grass, you know, you know, you're in a, and it was a bit failure. And I was just, that was just by car. Yeah. When you talked about, I guess you talked about it at length yesterday. Uh, whatever it was Friday, I think, or I guess I came back on the year, uh, what's it's losing? It's a bit of blur. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Uh, whatever it was. Whenever, whenever it was. Yeah. Well, we're still in the middle of the holidays. A QAIMS, so if I were also okay. We're still, uh, busman vacations. We'll, uh, to the lower. That's right. Well, let's, you know what we're going to do. We'll show on a real station. We'll sales manager and a real general manager and a real, uh, whatever. And a real bunch of scam going on back there with promotions. By the way, you oughta get me killed in there. You're ms spanking. Well, he's at it. Well, I know he did say something to me about. I wouldn't have to put the seed money up this year. And they were going to go out and get, uh, you know, but he never gave me any specifics about that. He certainly didn't let me know what they're going to try to rate my good sponsors for $5,000. Huh? Yeah. I mean, the seed money I put up and I wouldn't have bothered. I wouldn't have bothered me to put up the 10 grandest. What I give to the charity or be you're anywhere when we do this thing. Wouldn't have bothered me. But no, let's go out there and try to screw up some accounts. Let's try to, you know, we don't have that many left. So let's try to screw over to few of the meals got left. 28 past 10 of QAM.

Let's take a look at that award winning. Christine lineup. This is the first day we've had in a long, long time with the whole family. They got some much buffers here today. I'd be like that. All right. We had to go this morning followed by the thumper. I'm here, at least for the time being. More Howard David and the... No, no, no, no, no. Not a dog at Fortal 6 3 tough as he's back after a long hiatus road. Panther preview, Panthers were at a coma last night in Jersey. If there were 1500 people there for that game that was a lot. I have never seen a place that empty. It was like the inside of an oxygen tank. I mean, it was just sterile. And the game moves about the same. Anyway, Panther preview with 6 30, they play at the Islander 7 o'clock tonight who are right for the picking the Islanders suck and any K after the hockey game. Pretty pristine line of a Vsme. I'm waiting for the fruit. My first call of the year of 2006. But how do you like that copion at Armstrong 4 to sale ended yesterday? Whatever. Exactly. That's, you know, we love David Rich and all our friends down here. And maybe we'll get a real piece of copy. We'll find out what the real deal is starting today. Because that was a copy that evidently ended yesterday. Although that's the only thing I got on my fax machine. But nevertheless, but I beat by the boot, but I'm... We got a little chaos back there. We've got a crisis in sales at QAM. How do you like that? Oh my God. Exactly. Well, they can't be bothered so in spots or service in the account. Because they're too busy going out through trying to... Trying to psych and money out of my... The few sponsors we got left on the station. Like, pomp and o park. I got that thing in my hand right now and the brochure too. You got it there, right? Yeah. You got it. Well, that's a nice cover for the CD. That's not going to happen. You got it. WQAM. Hello. Happy New Year. WQAM. Hello. See our press debunk. It's a very slow. It just takes forever here. We're going to get it. Wow. Gobbing through, take your seats. Yeah. Khaben crew would take a dump. Wow. That was not good. That was not good. My last K-Lemik sprints. They just don't know how to board a flight. They just don't know how to do it. It's just chaos. I don't know why I want to go through it again. But traveling is a pain to the against. I mean, yeah. In addition, which... Well, let's you go. You can go through it. I don't know why I want to go through it again. In addition, which... Well, let's you go. You guys can go to Amsterdam next time. Great. And maybe walking is the best way to travel anymore. Well, that's what I do here. Of course, the three days I was there. I laid on the counterwatch TV in 8 all day, which is, I think, I'm a bird, you know, a death. Right? Now, that place is hazardous to your health. And I'm serious. If I had to stay there, I'd have been dead a long time ago. If I wouldn't be here. I... It's just... It's scary. How the people stay alive. In addition to which... Let me also say this. To talk about it is one thing, but to be there and look around, in terms of the devastation from the hurricane. Yeah. To see all the trees, the millions... The only good... A good and a bad. The good thing is that most of the Malalukas got knocked on the bad part of that is that all that crap from the Malalukas is in here. Right? Right? Yeah. So it turned all of that... The allergens loose in the air, which is why everybody is weasings and sick and puke in their garden. That's why... Anybody puts up a Malalukas tree ought to be shot. Okay, no more Malalukas makes you want a puke, okay? No more. But you drive around here and then, of course, all the tarps on the roofs and then everybody including me is preoccupied with trying to put their property back together again. That place is years away from being back to normal. Not months, years. Am I right? Yo, you're right. It's a... It's a disaster zone. It... It... it looks like they were a war zone. Looks like he were dropping bombs there when a bomb aground they made it every hood. WQAM happy new year? Looks wrong with magic. WQAM happy new year? Yeah. Yes sir. Hey man, how you doing? Okay. Back to you. That's the what we should take. Did you? Were you watching the... Did you attend this thing with Dick Park? When did that happen? I'm not unbelievable. I didn't see it alive. I saw the call. I actually slept in the monitor and everybody's screaming about how grotesque was to put him on the air and the level of respect. The guy's like, what's... I can't believe he did that. Yeah. Well, of course, he'll show you his PR people. Only care about it. Like somebody said, I think it was Keith Oberman last night. Only care about his Dick Park productions and all his business enterprises. They don't give a crap about him. Yeah. Anyway, let's have a happy new year, guys. Same. I'm telling you that you made fun. The Lord got even with Dick. How did you that? Did you see it? No, I would like you. I saw the clip afterwards. No, I went to bed. I got a new year's. Even in fact, starting about 72. I've been to like all the, yeah, who's my neighborhood star, but the fireworks. And then the next morning, whatever they had left over, they were shooting those off the next day. Nice. Oh, yeah. We got some fireworks. Let's blow off some fireworks today, here. Yeah. And... Something to do, I guess. Yeah. How many QAM? Hello. Hello. Speaking. Hello. Hello. I've been even the gun control. They should hold the gun with the hand. Okay. Somebody QAM, hello. Hey, good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. Do more have a girl to get you in. You and the guy in the morning, you do the cross from a lift? Yes. Oh, hello. Somebody QAM, hello. Hey, Neil, I'm happy to hear you. Happy new year, man. Hello. Hello. You same girl, so short. We're from Thailand. I got a good machine. Good. Good. Good. Good. My machine gun, man. I'll do with a pre-operation. Two million people. I got 1639 people murdered last year. That's kind of scary. That would be like in... That I guess here, we got about double that population here. So it would mean a... Four... Four... It would be like 30... 30... 200 murders a year. And again, I'll bet on a shape of about 70 years here last year. And 52 with guns? No. I didn't even write. I want to get into this thing about the Pomp and O Park. And then, not so much, you know, although I will give him a free spot, I guess they deserve it. But about the... and see, keep in mind, okay. This is something I found out by accident just having to be there. And the fact that they brought this up. And I said, well, and Steve will say to me, oh, I've got the presentation downstairs. I've got... I said, bring it up here. Please, I want to see that. So I got it in my hand right now, and he presentation as well. About this so-called best of Neil, a CD, which is not going to happen by the way. Nope. It's just... that was the beginning of my blood pressure just zooming up there. And I'm thinking to myself, you know, why would you do that to me? Why would you do that to find people or a so supportive and one of our fine? I did have a good time with Dick Finder. We set together in the A-Dinner and you have to up about reminiscing about old drivers and tracks. And all of a sudden, we had a good time. And Derek, my friend Derek was there making everybody an offer. They couldn't refuse, but other than that. And by the way, Steve will have to lose an answer to for Neil, or will you please, if you want to make it to 2007, my God. No free spaghetti dinner, I guess you knew that. Right, they had me read the spot. They didn't have any money. Steve will have to eat all the spaghetti. That's what happened. I guess so. I do there with more tonight. I'm talking about a puppet from hell. But anyway, they were very nice to me, and they're great. And I loved them like crazy, and I had a pretty good time. Only made a couple of bets and lost them both, but I just... Yucked it up all night, which is a good way to do it.

I follow him as a real conversation between celebrity on star operator Ron Jeremy and on star customer Susie Jenkins. Okay, I've never been here before and I need to get home. Let me turn on my own star. Hi, I'm points for Ron Jeremy. Where do you need to go today? I need to go home please. All right, turn left. Okay. Go straight for 20 feet and go right. Okay, all right. May God last. And turning. Now turn into the driveway. Okay, the driveway. Hey, this isn't my house. I know it's not your house. It's my house. Come on in baby. What? Thank you sweet Jesus for saving all of our kin. Oh, wait a minute. Damn you, Jesus, they're all dead. Yeah. And that's something. Well, not all of them. Well, one guy. Well, he's close. Although they said they they'd check for Brandeys. And they couldn't find one. 485 votes. Neo Rodries is very entertaining. 198. Oh, yeah. A voice of reason. A genius. 66. Two bad moms in a ground. You know, it wouldn't be proud of genius. A fat old fat, 50. A panic, 32. Stay old 20. Oh, no one is why keep voting in voting. You keep your honor off that golf course anyway, Mo. The vices of six boring five and a big one. And all those four and any five people by the way, keep in mind. They're all listening. Whether they like it or write it. Keep that in mind. And that's why put all those negative choices on there. Cause I find it most amusing. Oh, they show us. So stay out on. We were all as stuffy for. And that. Yeah, Jane. Okay, what you hear to you? I'll tell you what's really still. In fact, I'm going to start dumping him as a guard. He just, you know, he doesn't get it. He'd be funny like once a week. And I already passed him along the moment. We passed the torch since Mo finds him most amusing. He's like that guy. I like the. Great. The two of them can make sweet music together. And you think? Yeah, right. So, well, once a week, it would be fun. But I'm just going to start dumping him all the time. Because he just out of control. I guess he has to figure see something with the show. Yeah, like run. When I'll run, we're going to see him. I just agree with you. I'm run. I mean, right. He's annoying. But once in a great while, he blew up something. He's a great while, but he calls me. Well, he's a great while. Well, I mean, goes to show you. But the other guy is never going to be anything different. It's always the same crap. That's all he's got. Anyway, so I'm at Pompano Park on Friday night. He's got a good time there. And I find out that this radio station and Troy Stradford, who inherited that account, he inherited a lot of accounts and just keeps ciphoning off the commission and struggling in this pocket. He passed along this scandivin. I'm going to read this too. Okay, it's got a picture of the cover of the supposed 30 and the 30-year anniversary. But that's a name of it. The orangish presents. Not third man. And it's got the Emperor's a character of me stopping on the bridge tender's grave. And with a hand sticking up out of the ground, you better know your laws, Mr. That's kind of cute, right? That's cute. Although, unless it's people that go away back with a bridge tender, they haven't got any idea with that song above and nevertheless. It says, WQM's deal rages will be celebrating 30 years. Not third man. And South Florida market in March 2006. Doesn't say March 1st, it just is in March. That's probably because the people have put this together, don't realize when it is. Just like you realized that we just had our 8th anniversary on QAM on December 30. No, I don't realize that. December, you know that and you were on the air that day. Huh? Did they come in and say, did they have balloons? Well, I don't know if they had the anniversary George, pass along all our best in the air and you two did they do that? No. No, it's something because we were only at IOD seven years. Right. So eight years, December 30, in fact, that was the day I told them in the way either when great head, tough call me and say, well, the studio is not going to be ready. And I said, either that studio is going to be ready because or I'll be in one some other station. Remember that? And all of a sudden, we had that last minute, uh, brother running around and scrambling to put together a makeshift studio because they lie a lot, you know. Anyway, goes on to say in recent years, the best in the arraggers charity driver's $500,000 in donations to a band and ferrescue. Why don't they point out the fact we raised probably your close to a million dollars all together for all these other charities, but they don't want to do that. And you want to know why? Because they probably don't know. Right. Camila sounds better one all they probably over million. Who knows how much? They will be our charity tie in again this year. This year's compilation CD, Neil Rogers presents Bob 30, man. Bob 30, man. We'll have cherished memories from his many years on the radio, retailing at 20 bucks each. As a loyal New Rogers advertiser, we want to give Pompano Park racing the opportunity to be part of this Great charitable cause. Your sponsor, she helps to defray the cost of production of the CD, guaranteeing that a hundred percent of all funds raised from the sale go to charity. As a per-this is the second page. As a presenting sponsor, Pompano Park racing receives the Pompano Park logo and phone number on the CD cover. Wow. I'm just breathless. Inclusion on 13 week promotional campaign February to April included our minimum of 35 recorded mentions per week. Not exciting. Campaign could be shortened if we saw the CD's it says. And inclusion as a sponsor on the internet total investment $5,000. And they agreed to this. They said, oh, I mean, I had no choice. They felt like, you know, they owed to me. And it was, you know, obviously presented them in a way like, well, you know, do this. And they said, well, we didn't want to, but they're okay. And I told them, don't, don't do it. You got a long life, honey. I'm like me. You got a long life. Don't do it. Don't just give away five grand maturity because like you're always something. I'd rather have them, you know, run the regular spots to wanting to allocate a career, racing all the other racing stuff they got coming up. The fact that the track is, you know, coming back into one piece, we got slots coming in the spring. All of these are all of these things as opposed to just given away five grand to make a Curtis Raymond Verhappy and Troy Strafford and Miguel Escobar and all these other goyam. Steven, I'm saying what do you say? I'm saying that I knew nothing about this. And that's I had never heard one word about the fact that they were going to go to the top of the park and try to restore it. I mean, squeeze $5,000 out of them. Yeah. Was it ever suggested to me, well, you know, we're going to do it again. And you can put up the 10 grand seed money like you do every year is your contribution to the charity. And then we'll just go from there. Have I ever objected to that before? No. No. I would have done it again this year. Now, you see, if I'm working for a company that appreciates my efforts of this radio show, well, I know it's something that's amusing. That's hysterical. They eat any company would put up to 10 grand and say, well, is our way of thanking you and helping celebrate a 30th anniversary. We're going to under, right, to cost the $10,000 to to start the production of the CDs and get to this thing going. And we want to be gone. We'll be behind it. Right? Right. Like the old place used to do. Right. Not here. That's not the diesel eff and way, baby. $10,000. You think money grows on trees or what, Mister? They got to pay that six cent dividend. They'll share holders. Spent those growing trees though. Vangio's dobro on trees and so do Hillbilly's. That's, I bet you some of the CDs will wind up and help the lay haven. Wouldn't surprise me or maybe Hillbilly Hills. Yeah. They're picking it right now and I'm tuning it. So there you go. That's the deal with the pump and a partner. That's what really set me off and got me really just, and I'm still highly upset. My pressure is just soaring right now. I can go straight on the ear. Be sure and tape it. You know what I'm saying? For a point already. Right. In a heartbreaking turn around officials this morning first and on. Yeah. And this is really amusing because this is from the New York Times. Now the reason it's amusing is that most of the news. This is like doing beats Truman. Right. Most of the newspapers that went to bed before 1130 last night. On the front page, their banner headline this morning is. Miracle rescue 12 survivor. And of course well guess what? Surprise. Psych. In heartbreaking turn around officials this morning first and out said 12 to 13 min. Is trapped in a West Virginia cool mine had been found alive and then three hours later. Surprise. Disclosed that all but one of them in fact had died. The reversal of the brothers who had gathered at the mine and Sago West Virginia's stunned and furious. One minor was rescued. A doctor told the AP that the survivor ran down the Chloe June 27 was hospitalized in critical condition. We believe there were 12 survivors been a cavehead field. The on this guy. Oh brother. This is the one that was on all weekend and all day yesterday. We believe there were 12 survivors said been in hatfield. Chief executive officer of international cold group the mine's owner. That was the initial communication from the command center but it was wrong. I mean it's kind of hard to tell if people are dead or alive you know. Sometimes here is a sound soft Florida. Mr. Hatfield told the AP that the mistake in reports spread when people misunderstood a cell phone conversation it overheard and we out of he said the call was reporting The 12 miners had been found without information about their condition. Well that sounds like nitpick into me. Praise Jesus. Thank you sweet Jesus. Oh oh. They're in your sweet Jesus. They're in mind. Oh I'm your sour Jesus. I'm sorry. I mean Jesus is a net sweet and sour pork these days. Poor it. I doubt it. He was kosher. Now. Mr. Hatfield told the AP they waited to correct the false impression until he knew more about the minus condition. Let's put this in perspective. Who do I not to celebrate? What does that mean? Who do I tell? Not to celebrate. They didn't know who it was that had the you know the survivor's family. Yeah. Can't say that they're all dead. So let's just say they're all alive. Governor Joe mentioned the third was it lost this morning this plane how the false report of a rescue would come about. There was clearly. And then this is going on now hour after hour. Oh yeah. CNN is immersed in this. There was nothing else going on in the world that they hand out 85,000 indictments against every member of Congress and all the ships had seen. It's not going to make any difference at all. Because they're in this up to their earlobes. And by the way, they also had the wrong information. Anderson. With the loose pooper Cooper. Yeah, what about him? He's the one. Anyway, man's in said he visited a room next to the one in which family member. Oh, and I guess who was right there last night. I saw her. I was channel surfing. He's across the earth. And he was sharing. Some of the other just punch your right net nose and that big nose. I'll do. I love to see it right on the ear. You said, if they'd find a way, go get a vocal box. What is it about you? What anyone? Yeah. Anyway, he had all of there. There was a row of dubulation. Manchin was told that all the miners have been found alive. We swept the log and see if people. Everyone was so euphoric. They were like high five in and low five in, uh, grabbing it and everything else. But several family members told MSNBC that officials from the money company were the source of the false report. Mr. Manchin said he repeatedly asked the official he was with. Whether the information had been confirmed and said that he went to the command center. Whether the rest he was being overseen to see more information. When we got to the command center, they were static too. They were high five in and uh, duke and in driving. He said in a statement, it might have been to resolve the different teams going in out of the mines since their since were limited for safety reasons. We knew from the first the odds were against this mansion. Said we were hoping for 13 miracles and our still cling to one. He acknowledged there was a lot of anger among family members as a result of false survivor reports. I don't like that. Survivor West Virginia. You can't you see that coming on on until they pretty similar to our comedy bit near you. I'm going to be surprised to that shows up on my cable system down there one of these days. But in any rate. Oh boy. I'm biting my tongue. By the hard. There's blood just spread out of it. You're invited to hard. It's earned spurt now sometimes. Yeah. Neoroges is 524 votes. That's not too shabby 524. We got a shadow of what 600. But 28. Neoroges is very entertaining 223. Those are all my votes. Voice of reason 112. A genius 69. Fubbup. Fubbup. Not as smart as any though. But Bup. No no no no. A fat old 553. A panic 35. Stale 21. A stale last year's Motsiman. Device weight. Boring 6 and a bigot. One. You back start O's you. This is Neoroges. This is like this. This is 5162A10. This is the Neoroges show. This is your play. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Any questions? Deep in the jungles of the Amazon. Live something so large. So amazing. So wasted. It can't be held captive in a zip lock sandwich bag. Two ten charm star in team. Ball. It is great. During the expedition team as they venture deep into the weeds to wrestle the hay from the cannabis dry. Hey hey you guys. I'll be right back. And bring it to New York City for distribution by day. It's not here. Even in BoaPersa, just to be blunt about it, King Bong is some killer song, Cheats and Tom, star in King Bong. Maybe it's engine must be at least a quarterback and Showing every afternoon at you, no wait, for 20. Okay, man, start it up. All they're gonna have, 14 bodies, we come from the German skating ring. How come they're not making a big semis to about that? Of course, most of you are not worried about the cool minors. Nothing to be finer than to find a bunch of minors alive, but they didn't. And we don't care about the poor people that were skating on tonight. Look at this, there's your favorite during Kagan. I'm dear and Kagan. Yes, what's the other title of that? I don't know. The West Virginia body disaster. Tragedy at Segold Mine, it's got its own big headline now. Not just the story and the news anymore. It's its own, in fact, pretty soon they'll have a show on it. I understand the beat you're working on a song on it. Yeah, the West Virginia mining disaster. Now, I remember you were asking me before the show, if I have one of these handheld devices. The blood pressure tester, because we got one here. A little beep, I did. Do you want to be? What? Oh, that's exactly the sound arsonase. Yeah. Only mines of brown, brown, which I'll be brown. Brown? Yeah, we take your blood pressure then you shave with it. Clean it off afterwards, you'll be now that problem. Time? Huh? It's given there. All right, be banquished. Actually, I know what mine is now. Wow. Yeah, come on, chair. I'm not done yet. Oh. Whoa, stroke. Stroke time. Oh, my god. How do you like that? Thanks a lot, Clarice. And you idiot trust your ad for it. There's a one that pulls me over the edge. I think I should probably go back to bed. My pulse ain't that bad, it's 89, that's not good. About 10 points higher and usually it's. You want to know what the numbers are? Yeah, wait. 178 over 102. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Yeah, 120 over 70. Now you want to know what mine was this morning before, when I got up there before, even took my peels. Yeah, give us the 139 over 85. That's not bad for a. I don't know. I'm not that great. No, I mean, trafter, who am I? Sweet when you have, I love. First, that's not a bad number at all. And now I come in here and I take it a couple hours later, two and a half hours later, one, seven, eight over 102 after all a stress. I think a lawsuit is in order, okay. I think those people in there, place are trying to kill me. They're trying to lay a kill to goose to lay the golden big fat one. Is what I'm thinking. So during the next break, I'm going to take another peel. The what? I'm just going to keep popping peels. Oh, what the hell? Like, rush. Look what it did for him. George and Miami Jorge says, last year you picked USC over Oklahoma. I followed your advice and made some cash. What do you have tonight? Probably a stroke. What do you have tonight? USC or Texas. Do I like USC? Don't you, Josh? No. Why don't you take Texas all you want? You can take the long horns. I'll take USC. I'll take the Trojans. Okay. From my name, and you probably have some. But nevertheless, so Josh picks the long horns and I'm picking the Trojans. How do you like that? Be Neal, pervert the name. I don't remember what they're quarterback, or slay. See, I like to pick the teams that have the hot quarterback like Brady Quinn. I didn't really care that no one named God. Be in fact, I had to best of it all the way around. Ohio State kicked the rash, and I saw it again. I'm a big HD TV, big beautiful picture there and Brady Quinn. That looked really good. Better than ever, no matter fact. I was going, Brady, too bad you lost the game, but you're still okay with my book. I reached right in the screen, gave him a little pad on the back shoulder. A little higher up shoulder. So I think like how about every half hour, I'll take the pressure. Because if you take it a lot of keeps going up. But does it? Do you know that? No, I didn't. Oh yeah, well, if you were to stress as you are, if you keep taking it, huh? But right, told you, it was all stressed out when I got home and then like an hour later it was down. Well, you don't take it when you're all stressed out. Like, no, I should have done that right now. She just sit back and take a chill in the peel, man. And maybe a few people I'd like to kill, like in the tail back there, starting at the top. I mean, what kind of an outfit does this to there? And this goes to show you once again, the tremendous disrespect that this company has for this show and for all of us who work on it. Absolute content. I'm just just to try to lighten things up a little bit. Remember after that spot, which was obviously the wrong copy, by the way, written in lower case, small type way too long about a five minutes spot? It'll be happy to know, yes. It's obvious that it's way too long. Oh, I see. And what was said? Nothing. It gave it to you. It just showed up, uh, definitely. So this time we'll just have to be walking this way. So he probably would have shut the door. Yeah, that's going to be the liaison between sales and us because nobody back there once to deal with us except Troy and I don't want to deal with him. You just about got one foot in my grave, okay, Troy, you idiot, you quiz-lings. You're fair. You're simple, then. Anyway, here's the story that the auto voters have been had field guy again. Uh, I would do anything. I would have had not. Feel like better, buddy had field. Bobby had field or been had field. I don't know. His Bobby had field of one of the daughters that, uh, Bill Medley. All thought it was the, he had field guy. Was it Bobby had field? He died of righteous death as well. I'm here, brother. I sure hope he got things right with Lord Older. There is the year right copy, okay. I think maybe I ought to do this spot tonight. I'd be the white thing to do. I mean, the right thing to do. I mean, no, because we had the wrong copy for Matt's not really very nice. And says one of our fine sponsors. And we can't afford to be dealing with our sponsors.

But this is the kind of shenanigans we've got going back there because any audience, I'm sure thinks I'm exaggerating at Neil and he's a real panic. Yeah. And even the program director, he doesn't know where to stick his ass. And nobody said this morning. He goes to the viewer. He goes to the viewer. He doesn't know where to stick it. I told him to stick it. He's lost. He is lost. And I've turned his raven burback there in the sales. You're fair. Wow. This guy, he's got more different shenanigans going on. And all the moral screwed up. That's about at least he's consistent. The lunatic. Well, let's start off with a new year's resolution, huh? Okay. Well, that's not. 560 votes. Neil Rogers is going to die from a stroke within the hour. 600. Very entertaining 233. A voice of reason, 119. A genius 75. A fat olfag 57. We better add a dad fat, a dead fat olfag in a little while. I'll keep it ready. A panic 37. Stale 23. Oh, he's so stale. A divisive nine, boring six and a big one. See, I feel better if they're more hosts for big it than like somebody other ones. Because I am. Right. And I'm honest about it. I have prejudices and like everybody else, only most people I have about it. Oh, not me. I think that everybody people are people and you're right. Okay. Whatever you say. Gypsies. Do you really? I do. Tramson sees. Just they are. How about that Gypsy that comes and does my driveway? Well, he keeps showing up every six months, but every year and a half or two years old. Yeah. Your pissed off. I mean, for the hose. He has his own hose. Does he? They travel in packs. Six packs? No, two pack. Let's take my blood pressure again. What do you say? Come on. Do you want to kill me? I'm in the Donald. Okay. Again. That's central. See, and you see, you're knocking him. But he was the only caller we had right there. You think, oh, hey, I'd love to be a whole he called five times and that's five out of eight calls. At least he had him and at least you had him. Oh, I had the guard. How could be that? Now, he's done today. You're out, guard. You're the guard. Your last time on a show. Go, guard, go, raise your blades. Okay. You idiot. You slime boy. Yeah. Yeah. We don't need him to do that. No. We can do it ourselves by now. In fact, we got him at Tiger. They're having imitation guardlers. They're having guardler junior. Because he's just prophetic. Just tragic. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Better get them these phones. I might be dead before he gets finished dialing. 5, 6, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11. That's a scary blood pressure. You know what? There's a lot of work in on the year. Because you're nearly about now, during the show, my blood pressure probably would be like about 130 over 78. Something like that. You know, I'd be calm and cool. But it's bad. Smoke a, a spree. Oh, yeah. Then we do it. How about a big fat stony? That would, I think, put me over the edge. Former high powered lobbyist Jack Aberlaw, played a guilty yesterday. This ought to be the biggest story. But of course they got too many other fish to fry and a very this story. And how'd you like the way he walked in the court there. So looking like John Gotti Jr. He's a celebrity, you know. Conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion charges are great. A cooperating man. And then they said, the aimless done here. They're talking heads were saying, oh, he dressed like that. Because he wanted to send a message. You know, like Joey Zaza, send a message. And that is that he was taken, he would take no prisoners. Oh, everybody was going now with them. Good. Oh, yeah. I agree. Delighted him. Rubbing myself wrong. Aberlaw, aberlaw 46 admitted he didn't disclose receiving cave banks on payments from native American tribes to a partner's public relations firm. We're talking five million, no $50 million on that. $50 million. Five million, beteenots. $50 million. Starting in 2001, he persuaded Luis Yenatra, pain early 30 and a half million for grassroots work to a scandal and company, which in turn, take back nearly 11 and a half million back to Aberlaw. I'll go through the whole list eventually. And of course, all of that goody two shoes that the one from Ohio tells his name again. I love you. Nay, nay, Bob Nay. He's one of those religions, right? Goody, two shoe religion, just like Ralph Reed, who's also went up to his earlobes. Remember Ralph Reed, the Christian coalition, all of the other. Oh, yeah, all these good Christians, man. Praise Jesus and give me some money. WCW, I am happy new year. Yes, sir. Listen, I spent last week in Oakville, Ontario. It was very nice. Right now, right now, I'm from Virginia. That's a Mrs. Saga. Right, when we went to the mall there, and we spent the day in Toronto, which was pretty cool also. But you like to complain about the gas prices at our president. I would like to thank the Canadian government for three hours and seventy cents a gallon more or less. And right, and five to fifteen percent sales tax along with the surcharge and the liquor tax. Yeah, but you know something as well, worth it. And you know, I was watching the TV, watching all the news. And the crime up there isn't too significantly different than the crime down here. Wrong. Well, because they have the shootings on the boxing base that I mean, the crime that here is not even the same league as the crime right there. It's totally untrue. It's okay. Well, it doesn't even blow it on a proportion. I don't know. But unfortunately, because we had seven people shot on boxing the in one day, which is very rare. And the big deal they made about it should tell you that it is very rare for things like that to happen here. There were seventy-eight people murdered here all year long in a city of four to five million people. Seven eight. You could do that in a good month down there. Yeah, well, you know, I saw the scorecard shot and the somebody else got held up and then you know, it took the crime up there's still pretty good. Yeah, it's pretty good, yeah. Okay. Well, that's all. 90. How do you know? Good time, pal. Okay. See, Timber is stay right there. Okay. Don't come on up here because all you want to do is Matt. Typical software. Matt. Belly eight. Goods and moan. We don't want no vision. Belly eight in Americans coming in here. You know what I'm saying? It won't go up. Same throw in the pod. You can smoke the pod if you want. And we'll throw your ass in jail. Yeah, you know, talk about talk about a guy that was here for a couple of days and right away He's an expert and the crime is just his bad and he's right about the gas prices. There are wages, but they've been that way for a long time. That's nothing new. See, if that's the most important part of your quality of life is what the price of gas is. Well, good luck to you. The difference being that before Bush came in and started robbing from a Doomni Robin Hood and we've heard from the horse routine, robbing from the Pouring given to the rich before that. It was like, you know, what was it? Two bucks a gallon, one 79, one A couple of days. And I was like three, well, it was up over three bucks a gallon. See, that's the difference when it changes, you know, when people have to budget, I just pay for gas. That's a difference. In addition to which I have a feeling and I really don't know, but I have a feeling of the average wage here is probably a lot higher. I'm sure that the minimum wage here is much higher. Yeah. But I'm sure that there aren't too many slippers here. In fact, if you look at the way of property, you think you got a property for a woman's son for a, here, you can't, they can't build them fast enough. But nevertheless, I'm not here to be the chamber commerce. Okay. You like it where you are. Have a great time. I was there for three days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, it seemed like only ten years.

I'm not, uh, I don't mind coming in early into concamulating with you guys in the morning, but before the show. But now when he's other people, I just, uh, will not. Next time that they come in with this crap, I'm going to get up and walk out like, I get it this morning. What, what did you night do with? You, I, I, I, I, I went, I went, made my bacon for breakfast, and I just looked in, uh, sitting there, blah, blah, blah, blah, you know, it, this shows you what a bunch of animals we got, and everyone more ons you got.

It's like a hundred times worse than a migraine. And there you go. So let's go in there and see if we can meditate. I don't mind, tough coming, and tough as our old, and tough as our old, and tough as our old, I never thought I would say that. You're fair, but he, he's the only liaison we had with reality. And I tell that the parents this morning, because he got all bent out of shape. What do you mean by that? I just, what I said, quizzling, a little clearance there. You know, I see it goes to show you. And it's had somebody's butt for a long time there. Got himself advanced from being a sports flocking to be in the program director. And now, uh, nobody's telling him nothing. Or at least, so what he tells us, then you hear him say that this morning, you saw on a stack of vibbles. I got a tune it out. Like, I was tuning up the whole Troy thing. So when you work making any sounds, you know, if I didn't hear you like fixing bacon in the background, I was going to call 911 and not going to hear it. He fixed and vacant in the background. I got good ears. It must have. Well, you don't want to be up here with these expensive gas prices and all the violent crime, uh, uh, that TST and PST and the AST and the, uh, ASS. I'll be honest. I'll be honest. Wrap up before I go up there. Right. Go rob a bank first. I mean, here's a guy like I said, he's here a couple of days right away. He's an expert. He's giving me a song to dance on how bad it is here. It's bad. Believe you, me, you don't want to be here. I mean, it's like 40 degrees and murky. There's no snow on the ground, but it's not better. There's some coming one of these days. It's murky looking. The weather was good while it was there. It's about the only good thing I can say. The weather was sensational. That's great. That's great. It was beautiful. Do you want to kill a M? Hello? Hey, Neil. How are you? Okay. Hey, listen. I just wanted to ask you a question. Did you happen to see Dick Clark on the New Year's Eve? Now, somebody already asked in the answer. Now, while the reason I'm asking you is, what was the difference between what kind of stroke he had and what you had? Because you obviously didn't have any, you know, poms with your speech or poms with it. I had for a few days, but he had two strokes. See, the second one was a massive stroke. Don't you understand? There's like a little stroke in there as a big stroke. You can relate to that. So he had a hit. He had a hit. You had a little one. I have a little one. That's correct. Got that. Now you got your sum on it. I'm glad I'm glad you're all right, man. Thanks, Palli. And we have you made this out. Check it again next year. Happy New Year to you. Check it again next hour. See if he's still alive. But that could be a scam for the whole year. Let's have a, remember how it used to be. We're glad to come in there and do a few shows there. And they would all line up. All the sales people line up at the door. Oh, yeah. Let's go in there and ah, hey, oh, put on a phony egg. Go fake. Yeah. And then screw in would be out there. Although I think she was even more legitimate. I think she actually, I think a part of her actually liked me a little bit. Let's go with, yeah, they are. Okay. Seriously, well, she knew that I was the cash cow under my golf cart. Huh? Huh? Yeah, no thanks. So how are we doing on that poll so far? Okay. Here's a chance to take a good cheap shot early in the new year. New Rogers is six hundred eight votes. What do we got a shot at? 800. Okay. Well, let's not start too high. I noticed that nice poll like maybe yes. So you had a resounding number on a. Yeah, a lot of voters. Huh? It was great. It's especially since I forgot to talk about it. Well, you're welcome. New Rogers is very entertaining. 250 one. Even always a piece of crap. We hit him like boys and the hope he died before the end of the show. Right. Very entertaining. 251. A voice of reason. 120 nine. A genius. 79. A genius who goes. And can't make fart sounds no more. What would I like to? Oh, and speaking, I don't want to go into it. Wow. You weren't there when I talked about the getting fouled that I had on a plane on KLM. You had some foul getting. Oh, my God. If they didn't have charcoal in the seats, it would have been people's swimming. I think even a pilot would have liked passed out. Just remember your seat does double as a floatation to buy holy cow, holy moly. I have never passed such a mal-orderous gas in my life. It was foul. A genius 79, a federal fact, 67, a panic 38, a laugh riot. Stale, 26, the stale Roger show. And I urge you to listen to the show that follows mine. Divided 10, boring five and a big it five.

Yeah, that guy thinks there's a lot of crumb here. How about going to Jamaica, Mon? Go to Jamaica what a bee's lease hang out. 1639 murders last year and then a copy that's got two million people in it. Two million people. Let's see, there's 30 million people in Canada. So multiply 15 times 1600 is what? Oh, here I see a new math question. No, I'll do it. Let me get my advocacy. That's like 24,000. 24,000 murders a year. See, that's that. That's simple math. How come I actually did that long math? I heard it. 1600 times 16,000 and half again is eight is 24,000. You a math and we had medical genius like me can do it. Guy and a genius, you know. So they said, the poll there 79 people said I'm a genius which goes to show you their IQ. 24,000 murders a year if we had the same rate as Jamaica Mon because the Jamaicans like a good machine gunman. Yeah, a good machine gun. I don't know what would be the reason for it. I don't know poverty. I mean, I can, oh, that's always a good excuse. Poverty, right? Oh, no. Oh, yeah, I'll read it.

You'll remember after the TW way 747 crash over years ago Right in New York and then the Bob Francis came on there from the NTSB and him and the guy from the FBI They lied and they lied and oh brother Remember that I do they lie Anyway, you're love this story. This is amusing. I love we need a lot more of this prove Christ exists judge orders priest Really what is this going on and how can I watch oh? Well, you have to go to Italy, okay, and Italian judge has ordered a priest to appear in court this month to prove that Jesus Christ existed From the state what tickling myself. What are you really the case against father and we go wiki has been brought in the town of it terrible north of Rome by Luigi Castioli It retired agronomist to one study for the priest. It later became a militant atheist you go Luigi Senior cascule author of book called the fable of Christ began legal proceedings against father wiki three years ago After the priest announced senior cascule in the parish newsletter for questioning Christ historical existence or is that hysterical? Oh sweet Jesus. They're all alive that that was just so beautiful, you know They're all running around high five and then drive and everything and oh there lies a miracle They were ready to then pray. They're all playing they're all praying to God and Jesus to save them all and then Oji their dead well Jesus must have been busy Here we got all these college football games. He's probably bent on Texas When you think he'd bet on Texas Giants there are a lot more religious at least allegedly than USC I'll improve it's in California. That's right Yes, today guide tunnel my Tony a judge in Veterrable guide tunnel my Tony I just I just love Italian man social monsoes just can't get over it. It's just so wonderful although some of those people do smell bad a judge in Veterrabo said if he'll never hearing for the end of this month and ordered father wiki to appear Maybe you ought to order Jesus to appear The judge had earlier refused to take up the case, but was overruled last month by the court of appeal Which agreed that senior cascule they had a reasonable case for his accusation that father wiki was abusing popular credulity Jever abuse popular credulity that led the then every day. I think about it. Yeah, abuse it Senior cascule is contention echoed in numerous atheist but and by the way can I interrupt myself for one second if you must See the purpose of this show. I know this comes as a great talk to you is I'm not I'm not here peddling Toronto or Canada or Upstate New York or any other place on our role or Berlin wherever you like it as the Chinese say Gagos of their hate gay. That's it. Have a good time. If you like it in Fayetteville or Carolina You all have a good time. You like it in the entry. You have a swing in time So this I love these people are trying to convince me like it's there everything in Florida's got to be a big argument All in all this is better than where you are the hour. Whatever Believe me. I have been there recently. Oh Senior cascule is contention echoed in numerous atheist books and internet sites is that there was no reliable evidence That Jesus lived and died in first century Palestine apart from the gospel accounts which Christians took on faith There was therefore no basis for Christianity claims. I was existed What do I know being the militant bastard atheist that I am? Senior cascule is one man campaign came to a head at a court hearing last April when he lodges accusations of abuse of Papyrus quickly and impersonation both offenses out of the Italian penal code He argued that all claims for the existence of Jesus from sources other than the Bible stem from authors who live after the time of hypothetical Jesus and were therefore not reliable witnesses. I don't want to have a wonderful feet Paul in mind. You know, solve Paul whatever calm this week Senior cascule maintains that early Christian writers confused Jesus with John of Gamma Gamma and anti-Roman Jewish Insurgent and first century Palestine Insurgent church authorities with therefore guilty of substitution of persons Kind of like a illegal substitution in a football game So while you Christians out there 15 yards in the the down stays the same The Roman historians test it as insutonious mention a christus or christus But we're writing well after the life of the purported Jesus and relying on hearsay. Oh, no Didn't I have like no printing press where they read the good books? No, here this father now see here Father Reggie said there was overwhelming testimony to Christ's existence and religious and secular text Millions had an in case believe in Christ is both man and son of God for 2000 years. What a good scan If casculei does not see the son of the scod Medehy can not sue me because I see it and he does not father Reggie said Senior casculei said that the gospel themselves were full of inconsistent sees and didn't agree on the names of the 12 apostles even He said that he would withdraw his legal action if Father Reggie came up with him Irreffutable truth of Christ's existence by the end of the month The Vatican is so far decline to comment and then of course this story now what websooter? Oh the times the bread paper times online The UK now we have to have the evidence Ready for the evidence I'm hanging on the gospel say that Jesus was born to the virgin Mary and Bethlehem grew up in Nazareth preached in perform miracles in Galilee and died in the cross in Jerusalem But what kind of evidence is that the gospel say the gospel written long after he allegedly died right in Is antiquities of the Jews at the Emily 1st century Josephus the Jewish historian refers to Jesus as a wise man a Doer of wonderful works who drew over to him many of both the Jews and many of the Gentiles Goyam Muslims believe Jesus was a great prophet many Jewish theologians regard Jesus as an itinerary rabbi who popularized mainly beliefs of liberals Jews Oh Jesus was a liberal well, we do that neither Muslims are Jews believe he was the Messiah and Son of God Which we also know that that's the bulletin The pastor this the Roman historian who live from 55 to 120 mentions Christus in the in his anal I annals in About 120 suit Tony a south of the lives of the seas who says since the Jews constantly made the stirpens is at the Instigation of Christus emperor Claudius expel them from Rome honors Jews were always making trouble You know I was looking for wholesale right make a god not to show the neighbors man. Oh man I didn't tell you because you weren't there about the around me. It's not a big deal. It's not like a story But when I was in the Amsterdam and Skiphole waiting to come back from my Amsterdam to Toronto And the two Orthodox Jews the Getskis with the big hats and the whole and the whole I don't know It's just affected me in a way that never has before working I get what about sets Huh, we're gonna get one of those big hats.

Go ahead They can do it approval and they can they can apply for the war three days Little later retroactive like you said but no Not that because in fact now they're saying that they're they're you drive there wire tapping and you dropping over 500 people a year Mm-hmm and of course who knows who those people on my feet and what are the stories that I posted you might have read it or not The NSA also sharing the information that they got it with other agents like the CIA and the cry So even if you're you're not involved in spying or terrorism or anything like that They're gonna get you on something that's right when you hear that little not kind of do right about to a clock and I'm warning you won't be Xavier as far as in his bathroom Okay, or maybe will be Marine downright.

Were mulled for clearly the federal corrupting charges and washed in yesterday. Pines today. And just a few minutes to plead guilty in a separate case in Miami. Involving the purchase of Rower Based Sun Cruise Cousinos a fleet of gambling ships. He's scheduled a repair and federal court at 1 p.m. today. 12 minutes from now. A Vermont and his business partner Adam Kadan 41 were indebted last summer charges of beforeating lenders and there are 147 and a half million dollar purchase of the floating gambling operation they bought the company in 2000. South Florida Prosecutors charged the pair with line the lenders about putting down 23 million to qualify for a 60 million dollar loan they never made the down payment. Ah details, you know. They should have called die tech. Could end 41 to the gully last month to conspire with Abraham often a Sun Cruise case. And is if that is enough. Governor Jeff Bois your fat ass governor signed it a lot today and bill that allows four-brower parametrials to begin offering slot machine. Look at that good machine mine. As opposed to the good machine gun mine. That means that as soon as this summer three-way tracks and a fron ton can offer slot machines in addition to the dog and horse racing and high-line machines they are ready offer matches. Whatever. Horse racing and high-line matches. Do you ever go to horse racing match? Well lately they must wait high ever until the state department of business and professional regulation draws updated they guidelines for operating slots. Those rules would also include the way the slots work and guidelines that ensure the fairness of the machines mine. Oh everybody wants to get the hot machine mine. They would also include rules of what kind of background checks employees would undergo and how the proceeds from the slot machines would be audited. Proceeds from the machines will be taxed at 50% a ridiculous rate. Money that will go toward education Florida. Lawmakers have any entertainment. How they'll spend the money and estimated a hundred million dollars in the first year of operation. Lawmakers pay well we know about that but if you put a blue plan they drag their feet. We can already be a pay-a-half people plunging into a go-to. Wouldn't that be great but they're not. But this spring. I'm thinking by L. SyncoDemio. That's what I'm thinking. Okay. 5605060. Did we get any calls about the four-later nail airport? No. I'm sure the majority of the people in the visual are. Users are four-later nail Hollywood international. That will be probably most of them don't use terminal four. Like how do we're came to that? Everything I can't have in opinion since 9-11 because it used to be a higher and both. Yeah. There was nobody there. Right. And now you can't let you in past like just inside the sliding doors. That's about as far as you can go unless you're a ticket passenger. Right. So I had to be the adult escorting the teenagers back in there. So I got to go back in there and it was just fine. But I don't out front before they let you in. It's like standing remotely because it's so crowded. You know what I mean? Because they don't let anybody pass that point. Well did they have did you go through the security or not? I did. Yeah. I did they have that zigzag security where you go through that. I mean like a maze like in San Adel. No. I didn't go there during a rush time. Huh? I didn't go during a busy time. Oh. Maybe that's why they had that maze because it was so busy. Probably. Amazing. Crazy people. Come any QAN? Hello. Yes sir. And what they're not talking about with the mining accident on the news. It's the most important thing. That police had 205 violations last month for health and safety. Yeah we know that. That says they must be talking about otherwise we wouldn't know that. When I saw that on TV nobody said the talk to about it. Sure then. But where did you find out about it? Another radio station. Yeah. And that's where the whoever was on radio station is full of crap because I've seen that on the TV coverage a million times already. Well I didn't. Well not. What show did you hear that on? On scam America. Oh well, Scarameraf is full of crap. Okay we get like it's a big exclusive. Okay it's been on there eight billion times already and they've shown the chart how many they had last year and either in the opinion of Pollock crap. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Also the people who have to guide us run to the agency use to be a coal mining executive. Yeah. There's that really surprising. I mean the way it's president's doing. I'm asking a question. I'm asking a question. Why are you so worried about that? Because the media tells you to be worried about it. And now the disaster wait this administration runs itself. No that's the way the people around themselves. Okay as they let the media tell them what they ought to be all whipped up into a frenzy about. That's why I couldn't give a flying crap. A lot of crap crap crap crap less about this so cool mine thing. And guess what's on CNN right now? Live on the air right after it happened. There's just so many. I mean 80,000 guesses okay. Again it's the risk of sounding in sensitive. There's people going all over the place all the time. And especially the 2,200 that interact based on a bunch of lies. But the media doesn't want to cover that very much because it's bad for business. So let's zero in on the the hysterical story do you sure which we've seen any billion hours of coverage on. Well let's use to put air america man you get some exclusive crap that nobody else will know. Tony. Sure. Yeah. What a you bet. I got two stories by Doug Thompson your favorite. Yes he is. I got all his stories on there. I don't know if you know good for you. Vosious drinking and drug use must be investigated. Anti-gay group disrupts funerals of slain soldiers. But first speaking of stories that we have to be really whipped up into a frenzy about. So one of the first thing George said to me this morning said why should we care about that. Thompson for a long day who went to a wreck. And I thought to myself for a second I said. Good question. For I don't. I mean he's got a bad nose. And then come to find out that after I see it's like this story that we're supposed to be whipped up. For the cold miners they give you the false information. Like all of his kids sneak out of the house and he somehow he managed to get. Colony. Then he was the one who said it all up for him. How do you like that? You didn't see that didn't you the follow up? No I didn't. I've been ignoring it. His information comes on the TV. I came to channel. What you're taking. And American team who cut class to make a solo trip to a wreck we turned two day. Two days to his exclusive private school where official said they weren't sure how to punish him. Fair how about sending him to Abugar right. Ferris Hassan will not be expelled from Pancras but the 16 year old junior could lose his honorable status. Face requirement and the service or have points deducted from his grain for an average for skipping class. Said Lord is Calgill. President of the prep academy about son and students in Fort Lardadale. What are Florida's Calgill's kind of the cow seals? Remember the cow seals? Yeah. And here. Right. And everything. Here. You got here? Uh-huh. Not much. Not on the top. Hands on gray. I know. Still she seemed amazed by the voice Odyssey. This is probably the most egregiously interesting as could pay the students of Hedepank. I hope it doesn't get any better than this she said. What could it be to the mind of a 16 year old who knows if face. The son who my god. Now maybe this one doesn't have the story that I saw the update on it. That he comes to find out was the one that set up the flight and the range for the hotel for him to stay. And then of course the kid won't want to bring out in the streets. And everybody started looking at him funny. I'll have better go home. But cool to hell are you and what are you doing here and when you like to live another day. Stuff like that. You know? We're supposed to care about this. If I remember the reminds me of a ranzia that posted the illegal aliens that kids stuck in the wheel well of airplanes. You know what I'm talking about? Right. That one is the smuggler. Right. In the wheel well of airplanes. Oh, we're supposed to be really with them about that. You know, there's too many important things going on. Like Howard Stern about an unallairing king for the hour. Model 90. There you go. For the hour. Pouring some more publicity. Next call on how he. So let me ask you. You think that traditional first of your radio will be able to continue after. I don't know somehow we all seem to be still on the air and collecting a big fat one every two weeks. While everybody in their brothers trying to pedal a song to dance, the last time I checked, they still got three million subscribers and next time it's got five million and an equal and I've called that much. See what I'm saying? What do you say? I mean, what's three million and in fact the other thing I read was that Oprah and Anthony are not used to not like not getting any calls. Can you want to know why that is? Because they're on XM and is anybody listening there? No. Nobody's listening to Oprah and Anthony. So I'd be like that. Although it would be nice to have like a whole new, you know, a new horizon, a new bunch of not fruit cakes out there as opposed to the usual fruit cakes. But nevertheless, we'll just have to make do if we ever decide we get like a, let's say we need a station manager, a sales manager, a operations manager, some sales people. What are we going to have? Oh, please. What are these things? What is it? What's the work on it? Yeah. A sports lay eyes, a liaison guy. See what they're doing is they're like eliminating positions. And what I heard and it could be just a rumor but I heard that they eliminated the favorite position. You've heard it's Neil Rodgers. That's him. This is 5.16. Two days. But it's the one to do our. Our soldiers just know that they're close to the ground. I saw him out of my mouth so scary to see if he's not my cause. Overbrew. Think of the. And let's make far. Oh, now. So big. Oh, round. Oh, round. I'm in my shaving cream. So I left it home. My face. And I went to work under black nature. And I was fired in this screen. Drive in home. I was all alone. Take a simple way and trick somebody. I believe you better. I could see Jesus. There is back at me. I saw Jesus. I saw him all alone. I saw him all. And my mouth off to the. And the seat's been in my heart. Oh, my friends. Think of the. And the. And the. And the. So big. Love. I saw. So big. So I saw her all alone. Soぇ. So. I saw him in a boat with me feeding him the shadows, my first car Yes, I saw him in this boat with me, my lover, my lover I saw him in this boat with me, my lover, my lover You fair, I saw him home, I found a boat with me, to the park All my friends, they got much Downed into it, they fought All my sorters, all the sins All the love, all the love, all the love They're very easy to hear These are all of the players, man, one, two, a five, sixty, never cue him They just showed the USA today headline Miracle, 12 miner saved yada yada yada, how do you like that? Talk about having egg on your ear Wow, I still don't care about it 872 boats on a pool and we've got a shot of a thousand, that's what we care about The Orochis is very entertaining, you believe us? No, somebody thinks so 343, voice of reason, one ninety five When I read in the weekly reader that they had all those violations of the cool minors Yeah, it's a bulletin Genius, one-on-one Like that In fact, I got my dentist dig right now, I'm picking bacon bits out of my teeth A fat old bag 87, a panic 48, these are real panic Stale 32, most of those are mo, God 24, I'd hear like that Damn God The advice of 13, the anti-Christ 8, boring 7 and a big at six See a little bit of big at an everybody, like Jimmy Timmy Dean So we moved that one up a little bit, see if we get to nine hundred, that's 85, what's we get those other 25? We get down over there, it's downhill, right? Right, we roll right to that thousand man, but a good way, we believe you were the good feeling As I lay stroked out on the floor with my head off to one side Actually, my pressure is down very nicely, good I'm ready to do another three four hours, how's it that joint would help tomorrow? Or speak of that, good segue for Doug Thompson, the capital hill blue, the rant Forses drive and drinking and drug use must be investigated, he says This is kind of a long one, he's looking at the long stuff Is it a little bit long, it's long, it's real long, good I think I got time to do it too, it's real long He says it's my belief that person in Bush is drinking again, even worse he may be missing alcohol and anti-depressants A dangerous combination for anyone, let alone the so-called leader of the free world No one would have any proof of this just random events and comments from those who work in and around the Bush administration And who tell me that Bush has acted in ways that suggests the use of alcohol and drugs I'm recovering alcohol, I'm so we're 11 years, six months and 24 days And I've run across a lot of relapse drinkers who show the same symptoms as the present including Blanking out while watching television alone Slurred speech and stemming responses to simple questions, anger and hostility in front of staff members Unesplained bruises on his face and trouble remembering recent events or comments A lot about that scratch on his forehead During his trip to Mongolia last November where he was evidently seeking out other Mongolian idiots Bush openly sanded the local drink air ag, which is fermented milk with an alcohol content ranging from 3 to 12% In other words, booze Same trip where George tried to evade reporters questioned by attempting to walk out a locked door And then turned sheepishly to the cameras and said he was jet lag Some of the events that is tried was on steady and speech was slurred Uh-oh According to reports President Bush may be drinking and they would let him in sit in late night monlogue And I thought well why not he's got everybody else drinking Rumors that Bush was hitting the bottle surface and washed in two years ago Sources told us the present was using anti depressants in 2004 we reported the story The same sources told us last year he was drinking again and we reported an August The National Enquirer also ran a front page story on it But no mainstream media. Let's pick up on the story An August 27th of last year the Houston Chronicle reported on a party of Bush's ranch noting that Nothing the president said could be quoted But it's rare that reporters get underrated uninterrupted access to him for 90 minutes Especially when Buries served Bush who gave up drinking years ago drinking non-alcoholic buckler In alcoholics and anonymous we were in the stay away from a so called non-alcoholic beer Or a near beer as it's called the rude doesn't affect contain some alcohol in concrete Where we knew desire for mole The November issue of the journal alcoholism clinical and experimental research sites study by a team of California scientists Report the justice smell of non-alcoholic beer may be enough to trigger cravings And a subsequent relapse among certain alcoholics And my original articles about Bush's bonds with anger and depression are quoted duck through Gerald Frank A George Washington University psychiatrist author of the book Bush on the couch inside the mind of the president Two questions that the press seems especially determined to ignore have hung silently in the year since before Bush took office doctor Francis is he still drinking and if not as he impaired by all the years he did spend drinking Both questions need to be addressed in any serious assessment of his psychological state Doctor Frank's analysis of the president which is based on watching and reading And not actual treatment of Bush agrees with those who told me the president also taking anti-depressants In writing about Bush's halting appearance in a press conference just before the start of the Iraq war Washington Post media critic Tom Shell speculated that the president may have ever been so slightly inmedicated Dr. Frank explains Bush's behavior is all too typical of an alcoholic who is still in denial The pattern of blame in denial which recovering alcoholics were so hard to break seems to be ingrained in the alcoholic personality It's rarely limited to his or her drinking he is the habit of placing blame in denying responsibility So prevalent in George Bush's personal history that's apparently triggered by even the mildest threat None of this of course proves that Bush is drinking again or taking anti-depressants The only evidence we have a Bush drinking is the sampling of a local alcohol based drinking Mongolia And it's consumption of a so-called an alcoholic beer to party in proper Texas, but But my instincts tell me he's doing both booze and drugs and I believe as both a journalist and recovering alcoholic That he needs to prove to Americans that he's not attempting to govern while under the influence The longer mark climate writing in the reality based community notes lower over with rare exceptions The press seems very reluctant to mention heavy drinking by officials even when it's widely known Ted Kennedy's drinking gets an occasional mention But I bet that most of Pat Moynihan's constituents never knew their brilliant senator face they permit and battle with the bottle If Gary Hartstaking problem has ever made the newspapers I've missed it there was behavior in the Don and Rice Affirmative pretty obvious Those in the no-one understood that the frequent media references to bill wells is lazy And this has got her massive chooses refer to his persistent difficulty in keeping himself vertical after lunch But again the voters didn't even formally do's get the same delicate treatment Boris Jelsen's erratic behavior was in fact quite regular and predictable once vodka was entered in the equation Climate is right about morning hands drinking could find the senator capital hill watering holes almost any night Lunching in May different lunching in May different directions at once while stirping down his drinks A number of members of Congress are notorious drugs, but their annex are almost never reported by the press unless they get Neo for DUI or caught Flawicking nude in the title basin As a journalist, it's my duty to raise questions about the fitness of any elected leader Let me argue over whether or not it's proper to print speculation, but in this case I believe it's justified I'm doing my job. I just wish the so-called mainstream media would do theirs. He writes, how do you like that? You go Doug? Huh? All right, good work as always. Want to take a few calls? Do I want to know I want you to know? No, why don't you take a few? You might get some good ones today. 567 0560 You might get the guard over back for non-core All right, hey, yeah, we're run Now listen, we're not going to make that thousand votes the way this thing is going man.
