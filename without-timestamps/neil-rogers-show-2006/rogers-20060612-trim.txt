six sheep hell yes be shooting tomorows not to hang free and play mansion do you offer a station called rakual raises old now as north And there are the golds, the balees of big city at home, and that's where the bees leaves had to go for y'all a Riley Jones. On Oegean, he'll do what he's can. He can't like a friend. Then quickly walk away. They had jokes, go to five six o'os with ratings and the toilet mold to get those flaming-sportal mows and order and control. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, we're all in Go. Above you, learn and him the most. He lets mows. Go, and here's what mows gives you, he's all Joe. He'll make the big change. Every no-ray. It's where so the same. He hasn't done a thing. Or goes home the air at two. Joe don't have a stinkin' clue about a four. Not that essentially flows for whole radio. The G.M. Of five six o'o'o, Jolly, Riley, Joe. Walk solid. I'll tell you one thing, every day. It may or may America is always said about tropical storm ellibertary one or one. Why? Because it means CNN's going to be having a lot more Rob Marciano on here. The stuff that I just found on the internet, man, I'm going to tell you. Why don't they just put one big banner on there, all of it just sign it? I have no right. My God. Get a life already, okay, stop in a fantasy land. It's one thing to look and say, and that's pretty interesting, but there's another thing like to have to go online and like, oh, yeah, it gives them something to do, man. Yeah, it gets something of substance, man. Yeah, I saw that thing to one day line again. Last night it was on MSNBC, so the master repeated the later one on night. They said, did. And they're like obsessed with this. And the interesting part of it is to prove how much they were accomplishing is that most of these, most of them, several of the guys that they entrapped in there. Yeah. They said, well, have you seen us see me before on date line? We're doing a series on, yeah, obviously we're just encouraging people, right? Yeah, right? I don't know. Well, let you know when Rob Marcianos and CNN audio, yeah, Queens out there. Are you desperate, Queens, or want to take a peek? It'll be before we talk about yesterday, or the weekend poll. The Sun Sentinel is got their own poll on over the weekend. Also, Rickshaw congratulations this Friday, 50 years, exactly. Radio, radio business. I feel like that. And boy, that time, Jika, he's got a column on air, but a read it goes on for five million words. It's a lie, I am not, I'm not saying he even says that on air. So I go on, Ricky Tiki Shaw, would tip our own cap. What do what he's done under that cap? Probably a lot of mung from all the years he's been wearing nothing? Fifty years in the business, not in South Florida, of course. But so we're 40, I believe. Anyways, the Sun Sentinel's taking this poll. How closely are you following the heat now that they're like, you know, this bandwagon effect is going on. 7,618 votes on the Sun Sentinel poll. And I think the results are very revealing. Too bad our programming people aren't paying attention to things like this. 33.6% say I'll watch all the games and read the news coverage. That's about a third. 18.7% say I'll watch some of the games and read the news coverage. But 13 and a half percent say I'll read the news to see who won, but we'll watch in the games. So that's like a very, that's not really much interest, right? Even I look to see who won the game. Right, yeah. And 34.2% said I don't follow basketball. So if you take those last two categories and put them together, they've got 47.6 almost 50% out of 7,618 vote. Almost 50% have little or no interest in the heat. So once again, we've proved that they're all casting really pays off. Not, but at any rate. I mean, just on and on. How's the got their ass kicked last night, you know? Yeah, bad. Did I get that wrong? Oh, no, you got that right. I mean, I saw that score. Looks like they got their ass hooked big time and they've got two nothing in the finals. I just mentioned that in passing because a lot of people out there are intensive. So that's our poll question day. Who would you rather date? Check or a Rob Marciano. All your queens out there. I would ask the ladies, but of course the ladies, we don't have any ladies. They're probably all over their would-you're a rose, all the ladies. Here's the poll question from Friday over the weekend. 18, Edward, and 60 votes. That's not too shabby for a weekend in mid-June. I don't know. Not bad at all. And now we just replayed. Oh my god, I thought about somebody did a drag routine. My close personal friend Susan Candy, out he's out there on the beach. And she was wearing the same orange outfit that Rob Marciano was wearing before. I thought maybe Rob made the total transformation into a lady. Wow, holy moly rob. That's in clear water. And of course, it's only the, what is it? The 12th of June and you already got the first tropical storm of the season. Nice going. Better, better you than me. Alberto. Things started going in the 12th of the QA and we asked him Friday. When Joe rose left and I just mentioned Joe rose, he did. Said, $252 people say that when he really screwed him over bad. They lied, lied. They stole them all and they post phone meetings and Greg went into his hiding routine again. And then finally, they've stuck stern on here. When Joe rose left $252, I hate this full of $20. Although I sound like $1.1%. When Stern came on to 02, so you tie the first and the third one together there, which basically the timing is the same. And you've got like, not good news. Things started going in the 12th of the QA and they hired Joyce. She was like an afterthought. We added her later and she came on a very strong fourth. But let this thing go another couple of hours. She'd have passed this during. $195 for Joyce that bitch. Clueless honey. When they broke up the first team, 166. I think that reading is the right answer when he came right down to it. Because that was the beginning of the dilemma that they were never able to solve. And still had it obviously. When Scott Ferrell was fired, 150. Yeah, let's leave money or a little till we talk till we're sure we lost the license. Let's leave money. There we go. When he went all sports, 135, that's a long time ago. When Hank went to mornings, 123, when Mo was let go. That missed your Howard 99. When Stern was taken off 94, when Scott Ferrell was hired, 53, when Neil came on here, 46, although I have rumors on that deal. At 20 of those votes were by Robert Greeper and the other 20 back parents and six were by. With the Dota Dota Dota E. 46 when Neil came on, that's when things started going to hell. When Ferrell's became the PD40, when Joe Bell became the DM. Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, man. Just popped in the door when he said that. Who was that? John Deere, Clarence. Yeah. All according to well, a normal kid, he's a very handsome young man. Oh, is that right? That's what I have for an agent. Okay, spends this hour and a half or however long I had this meeting on Friday. This breathless meeting, evidently it was breathless. And his report to me later when the day is that, you know, parents is a handsome young man. I said, boy, you're going to get to an optometrist right away. There are a lot of adjectives I could use for clearance, but handsome is not one of them. Okay, I mean, good guy. Talk about desperate norma. Go out and pick up some hot runaways and forget about Clarence. Good guy. I wouldn't do him with Euro. Anyway, the tick when the ticket came on 21. That's when things started going bad. So only 21 is 1.1%. The ticket said really a big impact. Not. In fact, that 1.1 is the number they can relate to. When screwing God can 19, when Greg Weedless only ate and when Chris Moran left seven. So Greg Weedless and Chris Moran are a lot of wing way down in the bottom. So anyway, that's obviously Greg Weedless to the problems. And then they said, hey, that's enough already. A little bit late. A little bit late, Joyce. Here's today's pool so far. I think we'll do that one on the ahead for tomorrow. Okay, we should. Don't you? Sure. Because after all, this is all sports radio. Let's find out about the QN people. If they're a little bit ahead up to their ears with SAHF and IRA. And who the other ones we have on all the time? Randy Pofand. Pat Riley's on have Riley. Of course. But I got a respect here. What's a story, Pat? What's the excuse for these last two for that last night, especially? I mean, again, given that was least competitive to the last few seconds. Yeah, what last night was a blowout. It was an embarrassment. But I looked away, Hank says, well, Lee, I ought to make Chris have him give an up. They made him 4 point favorites for tomorrow's game. Well, what we do, you know, who down two games to zip, they're thinking of a join on. Any interest on a show? Oh, I don't care. 720 votes. We got to 1,000 made in the shade. No problem. And by the way, if we do have a UN baseball game tonight, that's news to me, because it says, I don't have the updated schedule here. Really, the new one I say this morning, didn't know it doesn't have a, but what do you mean the new one? I didn't have an old one. So I got it says, Curtis 2 to 4 and then there's like an asterisk on there. I don't know what the asterisk means, because it doesn't, it doesn't say. There's an asterisk on there. But generally, when there's an asterisk next to something at the bottom of the page, it'll give you like maybe, maybe, you know, this is taken. That's, those steroids, you know? Oh, they're going to this, they have a set. And that's why Curtis is, I get the asterisk. In fact, that's the good news. Curtis is on today. The bad news is he's on every day the rest of the week. Air, resingle day. Wow. Nice going with that meeting, Norma. Yeah, Josh Darrell. He's a very, uh, handsome young man. Oh, what a queen, Norma. What a silly queen. Oh, and then he also tells him that they're going to be getting a letter from him. This middle of this week, even though he knows that they're going to pay any attention to it. That's the guy that's got real cloud. I mean, this is a guy that used to be a hell raise, a man. He used to like be a legal, uh, maniac. And I was just like, uh, he's whipped out. Curtis, two to four, mad dog for the seven. And we got UN baseball, I guess, huh, and any K after that. UN men heard something about Joseph Gacky being a Mississippi, which I think is a good place for him. Because everybody knows. Joseph Gacky's sucks, okay? He said it's a treat to feet year to a beat your feet on the Mississippi mud. That's what Joseph said. 720 votes on the pool. The woman I despise most is, I mean, is this even a contest? No, I voted twice and she's winning. Yeah. And it's down. Especially lately, because she's so obnoxious and is eight million articles about her. Everybody looked, oh my gosh, and the ones that really cracked me up are the It's like a Rob Marciano thing. Oh, at least he looks good. Well, of course, you know, get a attractive woman on there. People pay attention. She's a track. Oh, yeah. I'll tell you one thing. If all women in the world looked like that, every male would be gay. God, give me a break. Anyway, the woman I despise most, and colder, not even close. Every 91. She's got more than half. She's got 53.5% of all the vote. Condor, leisure, 103. Nasty, hateful bitch. Oh, you know who he left off of here? Who's that? Choice. Oh, man. You better add that on there right away. I have a feeling she's going to pull off the same stunt she did Friday. And there's climb. Yeah. As an afterthought, she climbed up there to a nice fourth. I think she could be right on Anzass, rightfully so. Condor, leisure 103. Hillary Clinton 50, 66. Ice, the ice princess. In other words, Dijk, offer 42. I wonder about her tune out that I care about. And that whole statement thing. Do you really buy into that? No. Not really. She's married to her work. I hate this pull 36. My X, Y, 36. Nancy Grace 24. Fill the shoe fly. I love it. That's because nobody remembers who that is. No more. Fill the shoe fly. My mother and law 11. And we see I put really cross being an airport on her. Her name really is really a cause. But everybody calls her. We do cross be. So that's what we put on her. And she's only got 10. And that's because most people don't know who she is. 12 at his past 10 a Q.A.M. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62. 8. I love it. You get a lot of it. I love it. If you Rogers, I was for Tolvedy, You owe you to A.A. Welcome to the world called Socker Championships. I'm Tommy Charles. And I'm Nigel Durby. Today is Matt Pitz for Scientologists of America. I'm the French Ray Aliens. How do you rate this match? Well, it should be quite the contest. So let me sign toologists. I guess a way to score made up entirely of clothes of Socker Great Paylaes. Well teams are taking the field. The Scientologists will kick off. Then what I'm doing? It's Calvple's passing to Tromford, In my clothes and my paylaes number 4. Paylaes number 6 is SLEPS. I'm losing the degree. I know what I'm roughly ball from Tromford. Cools attached to metric ways. But the Cruzy Shins. Except that black head of the net. The Scientologists take it with one year leave. And the way is what? What is this in a piece, Toby? The Ray Leans ain't hasn't true cultivation. Committed Mascorto. I love stands on laughing at. Join us for our next match. And the Southwest and Beligos take on the net head. Next on on the World Cup. So catch up is just two! That's 17. Now what time is that you asked the Czech Republic of Socker Game for the net? That's a newter. Was that a newter? Are we going to be carrying that or what? Because I think it's probably just as much interest as that as there is in the final semifinals thing. And we didn't update on that baseball game? No, we did not. Oh. Do we have a third person sitting in there with us today? No, we do not. Oh. Excellent job. Nice meeting there, Norma. You really get the job done. She is really something. In fact, when surprised me a lot of those are posting on the Internet about Rod Marceano, probably from Norma. Silly Queen. Leonard Pitzt, Jr. in the Baltimore Sun. How about I guess probably a syndicated in the Herald 2, but he writes for the Baltimore Sun. Oh, I see no way to make it. He still accomplished for the Herald in his column pair of Sundays in the Baltimore Sun. He writes this weekend. Apparently it's news that Angkoter is an SD piece of work. I had read a thought that it was the attraction. At least for those people who find who are attractive. See there we go again. So for give me for being mildly mystified by recent headlines about our most recent spasm of trash mouth, I.e. for attack on four women who lost their husbands in Rhyme and terrorist attacks. But then the attack is vicious even by Miss Coler standards. In a latest book, whose time do you won't read here, she savages the widows of self-obsessed and witches. These broads and millionaires, she writes lion eyes done, TV and articles about them, rambling in their status and celebrities and stocked by grief or Nazis. I've never seen people enjoying their husbands death so much. Evidently the widows sensor that they pushed for an independent commission to investigate 9-11 intelligence failures, their critical of abortion administration and a indoor senator John Kerry for president to nerve them. Miss Coler's tie-weight is drawn by partisan condemnation, New York Democratic Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called it vicious while the states Republican Governor George Fittanky declared Miss Coler far worse than insensitive. But come on, this is all part of the stick for this chick. I mean, oh, she's a chick with the stick. I mean, we're talking about the woman who said that Tim McVaselny mistake was not going up in New York Times building and that we should invade Muslim countries, kill their leaders and convert to people to Christianity. Frankly, it's easy to do what Miss Coler does. Just say the most outrageous thing in the most inflammatory way, just give moral and mental cover that small-minded, anti-intellectual strain of the electorate that recurls like Superman in the phase of kryptonite from complexity and in-insertitude. And when people call you on it, just wrap yourself in the flag and declare yourself a straight-shooting conservative under siege by that mean-old liberal media. It plays like gangbusters in Piora and never mind that it's a brazen lie. And Coler is not reviled because she's conservative, so the best and most respected pundits in the country are conservative, George Will, Kathleen Parker, Charles Crowdhammer, just an M3. They offer smart, snarky, cogent analyses of the world-national events, and if you disagree with them, not as I infrequently do, you'll be required to do some mental heavy lifting to dismantle their arguments because they challenged you. No miscovers reviled because she's mean, malicious, devarbwire, fraught woman for a cabal of blovieter, is bully boys and blowhards, uh, Russia and Bob Hill are wildly Michael seven and too many others, or please regard themselves as the guardians of conservatives and soul. Conservatives and souls should sue for slander. But again, it plays in Piora and why not? It's loud, simple and stupid, not unlike the Jerry Springer show. The nation's political discourses never been as polite and de-correses we'd like to think. Abraham Lincoln's political foe, foe's called him a bad boon, Lyndon Johnson once said that zero foreplayed too much football without a helmet, which I think he had a good point. When however, even widows become for a game for, viporous herodane with an axe to grind and books to sell, maybe decent people should wonder where the lines we've crossed and the type of nation we've become in the process. His quote is written by the way, felt compelled to release his statement. It said in part, contrary to miscovers' statements that there was no joy in watching men that we love Bernal live. There was no happiness in telling our children that their fathers were never coming home again. In a better nation that would go without saying, send your buddy Leonard Pitch. Nice going Leonard, you go, man. I would say you go boy, but that would be like, Consuit is a racial thing and I don't want to do that. Now, if you're just getting a little something here, come on, I love something, something for George. He's got three votes out of 769. We got the thousand words, so I think we do the World Cup game in noon. Is that really on it noon? Yes, 155, I believe, to be outright. Any interest? Now, all confessed, I didn't watch like the last five minutes of the Netherlands, whoever they've played yesterday, some country that doesn't exist anymore. Mogadishu, whoever it was, Somalia, Adam. And see a goal, did you? No, one of them was, the goal was already scored early in the game, I guess. That was the only one. No, I got to see all those people in their orange, sure it's all those Dutch people, a sea of orange. And the one thing about when you watch soccer matches, whether it's the World Cup or any other soccer match, you hear in the stands, all through the game. The whole time, it just goes on, it's a steady almost like it's a recording. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. The crowd in units in a row. Oh, and they're not saying like, let's go Holland or let's go Germany or Dutch, like, do Barales, they're all just making that same sound. That's nobody. They're hands going on at those, those editors. I think that's what it is. I see. Well, I find it incredibly controversial and boring, and I came and began to tell you, oh my, well, those soccer who look in the zone. Yeah, well, good for them. It's a bunch of crap. At any rate, Tom Jick writes a 50 million word P on to Ricky Tickie, Sean, I scrolled Ricky. See, he's an important guy, Rick Shaw. When I get 30 years on the ear, my, we Tom Jickie doesn't write a word. You know, just 30 years on the ear doesn't, you don't get an written up in the newspaper for that. At least not by little Tommy, of course, play his favorites now. And because of the fact that I've outed him for writing nothing about besides pup pieces about TV shows, he's pissed off at me. So he won't write none about it. And that's fine. That's fine. But on the 20th anniversary, I spent on the 25th, I'm sure that's the end. Because I'm sure not going to make no 50 years in broadcast. In fact, what have I got now? For real, come close though. Hey, go for it. 40, I got 46 years in the business. That was since I was 17 years old. Okay. So that means I got two to go on this deal. So that's 48. So if I had a two year extension, I would be 50 years in the business. I would only do that if Tom Jickie promises to write along column about it. But that time, I'll probably get canned anyway. What do you think? I should extend two more years of time or write a column? Good luck to you. Not an estate, no. Not for these people. Get that pirate station. Thanks by the way, Clarence for the health and the studio. Thanks for the fact that the studio was discombobulated again because of a UN baseball. So I knew there had to be some reason that I wasn't getting the feed. What time was you on playing yesterday? Did they play a game yesterday? They said, eh, aha. Because it was that time that I stopped getting the feed. The program from there up here. And that's when you came in this morning, thought everything. Don't start lying like George does now and start pretending that everything was like all, you know, out of, sink and all the settings we're all screwed up. All right, well, let me lie then because it was real cleaning here. It was a nightmare as usual. You just can't do a terrorist because you just don't care because what do we have to do? I'm going to show it. That's it. You silly goose you and by the way, oh my god, Norma says he's a handsome young man. Seriously, I don't know what to say about that. I'm just stepping things in my backyard. That looked better and clear. What all do we speak, you know? That looked better than that. Tom's record writes, we danced with him. We cruise with him. We're smoked with him. I never cruise with him. They sound tracked to life and sell for the seemingly always included DJ Rick Shaw. Think it's a little bit too long to start. I'm going to go on and on. If you don't care about Rick Shaw, you better tune out. Rick Shaw. So he even had his own jingle on QAM. I'm sure he had a whole bunch of jingles. That's the only one I can find right now. Which I find a little bit bizarre. I got jingles for people I've been on the station in 100 years, and some who are never on the station. Where does that one for Ed Berliner? There's always. The Florida Marlins. Ed Cameron. Dave Lamont. The Florida Gators. W2AM. Pressbox. Sports radio weekend. On 560. W2AM. Good god. Oh yeah. They paid for those. They're really little hole in my head here. They paid for those, man. That's a package. Yeah. It's a package, alright. And that's where Rob Marciano's got. I think I saw him in Naples. And a gay bar. There's some person in there. And then of course there's things on her about how he used to be married. And now he's dating some hot chick who works at CNN. Whatever you want him to be. That's what he is, according to the fantasies of the maniacs on the internet. I'm telling you some of the stuff you find on there. It's mind-boggling. And it's scary. It's really scary. So if you wonder about those pedophiles that are like cruising for a little kids or on the internet, why should you be surprised at anything you find on there? Because that's one thing the internet has given the world. It has access to some of the most desperate. I have no life. Creatures on the crawling on the face of the globe. Okay, we'll get the Iraqi ticketing. What I'm sure we're going to have a lot of people calling it with tributes to Rickshaw during the show today. W2QA and Rickshaw line. Yeah, how come you don't throw a singing motorway thing? Why are you calling him today? What kind of a phony accent is this? What? I said, what kind of a phony accent is this? It's not phony accent at all. Where are you from? Where are you from? Where? Romania? Romania? Romania? Yeah, go back and you've developed big kiss words. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.16. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. 8. you watching a postcard vote of carry nine people apparently say costs a post of point in me so we we have uh... strong hopes right now we're

the poll of the most despised woman is open for suggestions yes it is Barbara birthday said she has to string of evil babies grew up under her two lids to become evil adults passes all them under her two lids you know who used to be nervous about people's two lids don't don't don't don't go yeah that one I don't like to look at that two lids remember that one bit put on my favorite I'm sure you do mr. Howard I mean mr. Mr. mole Barbara bush let's get her ass on here and then here's one frauds he is john and Columbia john yeah I know you spent too much time in south Carolina he's got the view crew yeah question is the woman I despise most not which group of women or you know what panel of women or get a lot of good loss john Jesus God hurricane warning issued for the afloat of coast in the east coast to buy the northwest coast walk the river and then from long boat down to Inglewood this part right here being up here that's actually where the hurricane warning we want Rob Marciano get this ugly Chad Myers off my screen I'll see he's doing a stuff on the inside it's a Rob out there naked on the beach is probably on his way to Panama City right now oh speaking of uh yeah that Frank rich no relation to the lake fat rich in the New York Times says how his fan is speaking the new gaze I don't want to read too many stories heard Tommy a run out roover and a play in the tape in there with turrets and the boys robber anyway he writes he never promised then the rose garden but that's where America's self-appointed defenders of family vatters had expected President Bush to take his latest ad against same sex marriage last week in the end without explanation the event was shut it off a non-descript auditorium in the executive office building where the president spoke for a scant ten minutes at the non-prime time hour 145 p.m. the subtext was clear it was embarrassed to be there a constitutional amendment protecting marriage was a loser and he feared being branded a bigot as this debate goes forward every American deserves to be treated with tolerance and respect and dignity mr. Bush said in other words even if they're gay the debate died on the floor of the senate less than 48 hours later when the member was went down or even worse to feed than expected watching an instantly codified the moral a desperate president rock bottom in the polls went through the motions of a cynical and transparent charade surrounding his base in an election year nothing was gained even the president of the family policy network granted mr. Bush's pandering a ruse and no harm was done except again people that's why the president went out of his way to talk about tolerance at his rally bizarrely held on the widely marked 25th anniversary of the first mention of an AIDS diagnosis in a federated port mr. Bush knew very well that his participation in this entire political stunt while certain have no effect on the constitution could harm innocent Americans when young people here repeatedly that gay couples aspiring to my little commitment are undermining the moral fabric of a country that stuff doesn't wash off said madformin of the national gay lesbian task force most concretely the Washington ruckus trickles down into sweeping assaults on gay partners employed benefits and parental rights at the state level as exemplified by a broadly word to refer into by the virginic bal子 law a fall out long any kind of civil union had most of Bush really believed that his words had no consequences it would have spoken in broad daylight at the white house without any defensive touchy feeling bromides about tolerance mr. Bush prides himself on being tolerant and as hundreds of photos himself posing with black school kids just to prove it but his latest marriage maneuvered yet other example of house presidency has been an ableer of bigots and not just those of the pro family breed the stars of an alignment for a new national orgy of ranker because americans are angry the government is filled with alleviate gas prices the economic anxieties of globalization or turmoil and a rack two thirds of americans believe their countries on the wrong track the historical response to that flight is a which hunt for scapegoats and whom we can project our rage and impotence gay people are traditionally handy for that rule are they surefire scapegoats they once were support for a constitutional marriage amendment ABC news found fell the 42% just before the civil court hence the rise of a juicer target his fanics they are the new gaze the foremost political pinniat and the election year of 2006 as has not been the case with gay civil rights mr. Bush is taken a humane view of immigration reform throughout his political career some of this is self-interest he wants to cater his business backers hunger for cheap labor and car robes hunger for his panic voters the mr. Bush is always celebrated promoted immigrants and never demonized them at least in Texas in the white house he saw line immigration after nine eleven and back to away from a guest worker when his party bought in 2004 after bragging about his political capital upon reelection he squatted it on a rack and a quick side of campaign to privatize social security now Congress is acted without him turning immigration reform into a deadlock culture war not unlike the marriage amendment a draconian federal laws unlikely but the damage has been done the ugly debate has in itself generated a backlash against a vulnerable minority so all you Julio's out there you the new uh gay community a gay community his fan of community the black community the uh not head community that's what we got

without mirror in chambers is that greater one huh do do do do do do do do do do do you do you do you know you can't go out there yes sir i was wondering what happened in the cross over i beg your pardon is another contract call there was more than that that this morning with that two and then you weren't on a hundred and you were doing it anymore you stopped it yes that's that's a good idea when you want to why did you have to eat a i'll give you an honest answer if this is like a legitimate call which i know because of first of all the cross over was all on my time i can understand it the cross over was uh i can wait you know eight or nine minutes till ten and we carried over a few minutes into my show but the cross over always wound up being only on my time that's number one plus number two hank is basically a part time employee he's you know he's got the first to find his uh he doesn't basically whenever he doesn't have a plan to catch a reason doing the wrong man or the pre-chist and it's just more inconsistent program we don't like that why i have a lot of it if i can finish i want to go back our days when this show is from ten a m the two p.m. period right well i was just gonna say instead of it going away one hundred percent of the time maybe when you guys really have something you want to say to each other in front of the audience you know i'd be nice no i'd never be late that was kind of contrived yeah and it's we're done okay okay no it's that thanks guy okay no problem okay wow what i what i really meant to say to that guy was i'll find it okay that's it wow man like all of a sudden this is a big deal whatever you're just not doing it no more you know every every time you turn around well uh we're not gonna be doing it hey hank's got to well do something for ESPN and that's fine i realize it's just like a you know a smaller segment of hank's deal he's a big guy i saw him on the bell month i mean a big guy in the industry and he's got other stuff to do so fine but it obviously wasn't helping him and it's already doing nothing for us so what's the point of doing it's bad programming especially when it's inconsistent just like our two to four just like this current regime with our idea well we got a plan and maybe one of these days we might implement it when we can uh uh uh wow hmm i should would like to like i told you this before we'll have to be in a fly on a wall for green i meaning when you're my camp was uglienic and boobly eyes with the clearance and probably terraces making uglienic back that's uglienic love of thirteen

Think they call by number How come no one's chasing Which where are my faces So get it dodged Yesterday Yesterday You deserve it. Put it here for a lot of the final 60. What do you see is flying a lot of the new before you know it's time for that soccer match. I'm not going to be able to be doing a show on the soccer zone. You asked playing USA. That make all I'm growing noises in a background like that. You know something if you're watching soccer, I can understand people making growing noises. You know, the guy kicks the ball and the goalie picks it up and he heves it about 50 yards down the field. And then they patched you around it midfield back and forth and back and forth. They just say, I don't get it. He holds it. He holds it. Oh yeah. And if we in the meantime, the clock is running. Keep in mind. Like in that Netherlands came against the country that has been invented yesterday. And they like a minute and a half ago. And so at a goal, it gets all of the ball and he sits it down. We're just going to kick it from and he kind takes his time. The clock is going on a ticking ticking day like, you know, it's just idiot. The whole thing is stupid, you know, and you want most of it. Nothing worth to being stupid. Nobody said something like that. Kind of like our management. You know, we are we're not like losing audience. We're like hemorrhaging audience. Hemorrhaging ratings, hemorrhaging everything. And their response is like, but it be terrible. But of course, thank God it turns one god Tommy in there for us today. That's right. That's right. You're doing it baby. You are doing it baby. Is it vitality? And that would be what you would say? Yes. I think big vitality waste is time with parents. Although he is a very handsome young man. I bet you we got a well over nine her votes right now. I'm thinking on the poll. 9, 6, 6. We are going to make the thousand by noon. Then you'll see the kind of letter that they're going to get. And it's not going to be from Norma. Can't even it's going to be from me. It's not going to be a letter. It's going to be a telegram. Even the box tops never said a letter like this. I bet you don't even know what that is. Do you do it? The box tops in the letter? No, I don't. I bet you Tommy remembers that song. Well, this is a member of it. You know that song? Which song? The letter by the box tops. No, sorry. I can't say that. Tommy useless as boobs are a hog. How do you know they useless? Well, I mean you can find some useful. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today. The nation's death row in May is can file last minute challenges to lethal injection after they've exhausted their regular appeals. The courts ruling in the case of Florida death row in May, parents, he leaves unanswered and high-ever. The broader questions about the chemicals used in lethal injections around the country. And whether they cause excruciating pain. Oh, gosh. I know how to solve all of this. You know how to do it? How's that? And I'm not joking about this either. Remember Gary Gilmore and Utah probably not. No, I don't. How about Doug Gilmore and Toronto? Do you know anything about anybody? No. And that way that. But Josh goes ahead and he puts stars, Joe and Barbara Walters on the pool. Yeah, I did write that a ball on. Right after I would do people that I've written an an- I'm going to ask that Jack has to stop here. Lining you going, oh, I see. Okay, they don't have any votes. Come down. What's that was I just saying it was much more important than that? You were saying how smart I am than how much I know. No, just before that. Oh, but Death Row I was going to solve the problem of executions. Okay. There you go. I'm not joking. What are you saying? Fire ensquad man. Instant painless. Not cruel. Run usual. What? No painless it is. But line them up. Well, they can sedate you. I mean, you know, they can do whatever they want about that. But it's instant. How much pain would you rather go by a bullet through the head or would you rather have that needle, lethal injection? Certainly not the electric chair. Old sparky. Not only any of that. You know, again, the guy's hair is fine. I only have to shave your head anyway. Free haircut. Fire ensquad man. That's the way to go instant. I mean, he got a whole bunch of guys with you. It's not like one guy maybe has bad aim. No, but he'll throw only one guy with a bullet. The rest of them have blanks. I think that's how it works. Nobody knows who to be. A killing. Yeah. So they have to have a guilty conscience. Why would you have a guilty conscience? Because obviously, who maybe you find out that guy didn't really do it. You know? And then like a couple years later, oh my god, the real murderer came forward in this guy. We executed an envelope. I was going to pull the trigger. Well, at least it was practice for the next one. Anyone. I mean, if you're going to have a death penalty at all, of course, there are a lot of people around the world that think it's inhumane, etc. How about beheadings like our good friends. The Saudis do, you know? I still say all that crap about the elves or cow, you know. He'd beheaded Nicholas Burg, he was barbed in. Well, yeah. So how about all these other countries like Saudi Arabia? And I say, oh, there aren't that many of them. Just their good friends like the Saudis, the right kids, that are raping us for the gas. 972 votes, man, or something really exciting going on today. Why don't we get like 400 calls about that crossover 10 o'clock? I'm just not doing it anymore. That's all. Yeah, what happened with that? You want your answer? There you go. God, like we owe them an explanation. That's the way it is, okay? It's done. It ain't happening no more and ain't doing anybody any good. And just kills an awful lot of time on his show.

And the decision which Hank belongs on in the afternoon anyways, as long as we're likely in the right out there for it, he should be back on in the afternoon. That's where he belongs. Which goes back to the pool we had on Friday. They broke the radio station into a million different pieces, Greg did that, and now we got these four shlumpers come along, and they're trying to face the pieces back together again. Would no success. Let me say again, where a hammering audience on this station. Hammering. You know what that means? No, not Dick Perton. 26 past 11 and five, 60 and about how's Mara Rob Marcy and her don't he? He got his clothes off yet for the beach. Well, I would say all the fags are all excited now man. All we can look, we're going to be seeing Rob Marcy and her once has come out of your ears. He's one of those guys. Say I'd like to see him in person. You ever see people on television that sometimes they look really good and sometimes from a different angle they look like. Maybe not so good. And then it's kind of like when you see somebody in a shopping mall, like maybe 100 yards away and you think, wow, you know. And then as you get closer and closer, oh my god, what was I thinking about? And then you start just peaking your guts out. Yeah, good from far but far. Right, right. You see that. Well, that's what I'm thinking about Marcy and her. Because you see him on her and there are times he looks really great. And there are the times it looks like, I don't know, Rob. I better put a few entries on there in that chat room. Well, if you could read some of the stuff on there, I guarantee you wouldn't laugh you would cry. I'm not joking about that. Believe me, you would literally cry. Listen, I'm no stranger to the internet. I've seen some of these psychos. Oh my god. And I just found that by accident. I just, I just, I just, I did with Google Rob Marcy and I clicked a couple of things. I got the biography there from CNN, which didn't tell me anything. Yeah, you don't have to look at where it. You'll find it.

Now here comes the profound statement from your fan ask governor. Good God, who would have thunked Governor Jeb Bosch said. Not exactly the kind of profound statement you want from your fan ask governor. Good God, who would have thunked. And then he said, During the past two seasons eight hurricanes struck or brushed Florida. I think this is God's punishment for fat angstia bush for every time the people vote on something. He has the least chances of earth to wear will be lectured because he's a dictator. And his wife's smuggler and his daughter say a crack addict. And anyway, meanwhile, Southherlandians were advised to expect heavy rain and gusty winds as squalls roam through the area. Later today, tornadoes and water spots are possible in South Florida. It wouldn't be some if we got knocked off the year. Let me know when we go off the air. Okay, by the way, his wife wasn't actually going to. I know that. Have you ever seen this kid George P? Yes.

Four castors warn that a wide swath of Florida would be hit with unsettled weather. Long advance of the center is arrival. When you think we'd have our meteorologist, what meteorological experts on QA right now since we're so new Z. huh? No, because the heat or the final of the body get it right.

Welcome about firefighters who've been battling wildfires in those regions. See that's the way it is man. You can't have it both ways. That's the way to Lord works. You get the wildfires and the firefighters got to go out there and risk their life in limb and then God makes a rain like hell. You know, but the fires up. You could probably just like snap his fingers. You know, make you go away like that. But that's no fun. Right? That's right. Don't worry. Five six seven. Five sixty pound five sixty in the Verizon signal wireless support. There'd be a nasty day. And of course they're hyperventilating about it on the talking news. They were so filming it tomorrow. Jay, let's check in with anchor. How the groinie to see what they're working on. Let's see that's another thing. We're probably talking about the soccer match. Our child whipped up.

What is this question for you? We're coming up in a couple of weeks. And I know you're familiar with the area with the Niagara Falls. We wanted to recommend to them. It's like falls you or like more at the scene on the aggro. Which would you prefer? What falls you man falls you. It's the cast me out. It's fantastic. Is the hotel mine? Beautiful. Brand new. It's only year old. And it overlooks the falls itself. And every room in the hotel looks right on the falls. All right. And then the machines. How are they though? Better with mine? I got news for us. Sir, even the dead machine is better than woodbind. Okay. Nothing. I had a bad day on Saturday. You know, we put your money. You take two chances. Okay. Listen, the atmosphere there is fabulous. You'll love it. I'm too tundish right now. I can't guarantee you're going to win. And of course, it's not just a slots place. They got a full casino. They got all the tables. Whatever you want. They'll take your money. They'll definitely come in and stick it in and the token too. And they'll think. Okay. Have a great time, pal. There you go. I'm a great place, falls you and they're not a boss. I kept trying to sell high figure over there. But he's, you know, he's a hard ass. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. No, no, no. You know what's going to happen now? Oh, there's a big few. There isn't any few. Oh, he'll get a few calls tomorrow. I'm sure he will. And ask me if I care. Okay. Because that's an nature of the audience. Have been doing that for a hundred thousand years. Oh, my God. What's going on? What are you with? I'm just as it was a bad idea in the first place. It got really old and tired. And it did not interest in doing it. I'm interested in doing 10 to two. You know, however, it's a good idea. I always had a whole requires. And every morning I come in about nine o'clock. I was still doing 10 to two. And then we're doing the mornings. And he would like give me that look like all. Now, and he else coming into bailing out in the saw. Because nine to ten was always the dead hour, the dead zone. It's one of the top nine nine to ten. And I'm trying to think of the other hour of the day. It's even tougher. I can't think of what it is. And I don't want to say. But it's a tough hour. And it was always the lowest rated hour. So sure enough they ate every day when I would come in. Oh, come on in. Come on in. I have to sit down. So instead of working four hours at it, I was working like four hours and 45 minutes a day. So I could pay over at Grylley's dumbass. Christ. I'm a hundred years old. I'm doing 10 to two. You know, somebody, I want to ask you this question. Name me somebody else on this radio station. Other than 80K, who's on whatever the last game ends. And some nice, you'll be worse couple of hours. Name me somebody else that does four hours every day. Nobody, nobody, nobody. Name me somebody else who's making this kind of money. Nobody. So rest my case. So would you rather have the time offered a money? I'll take the money. Okay. Me too. It's $156 and $5 and my point being, four hours is enough. Okay. Four hours is enough. Jesus, K, Christ, Clarence, you idiot. Jesus Christ. Although it is a very handsome young man. So what I hear. Well, when I, you know something when I heard that, I didn't know whether to drop the phone on a floor. I just wanted to break out into tears. I'm not the kind of guy. I'm not an emotional old queen. It cries at the drop of a hat. But you almost got there. But I almost started breaking out of crying like a baby. I mean, I'm as to God. Although I did share the couple of tears. That movie was on again the other day. What tells the name of that movie with Amyl Hirsch and Sigourney. We've heard of that movie. Oh yeah. Imagine every heroes. You started and seen them. I bet your timing wouldn't watch that. I don't know about it. You said I like it. You said it would be good. I think you would like it. There's a lot of drugs and booze. You know what I will say. Someone I knew wind up seeing garden state. Oh, totally agreed with that. Totally agreed with that. That is the word we should garbage. Man, don't waste your time.

Because nobody is speaking. Which is going to be listened by any how a smug. I mean, I'm sorry. Funny me. I don't want to hear that again. Okay. Enough with him. Enough with Andre, Eddie, canter. 40 minutes they play the first half. I'm not plus of course they got the extra time. I don't know how much extra time I'm going to hire. As if we really need the extra time. Because no matter what extra time they got, they're just going to pittle around. Look at this. Look at how much time he's taking. Are you watching this? No. They're going to play. He's just he's just. The edge in a way from the goal. And he's like kicked out a couple of yards of him in the clock is running. 40, 20 minutes. Finally. But I'm going to kick it all the way down the field. And then they'll bring it all the way back up. But by the big, better bullman. Like nothing's going on. You know, the fact that they scored two goals at all. I mean, this is really an image. That's a bull. That means you're missing the excitement. Yeah. Well, you know what? They can have the same thing. They can have this. And they can have your Zionist source too for the same price. God. We got this hurricane man. Gonna pumble the Gulf Coast up there. Rob Marciano is getting into his song, but he need now for his next on camera shot. Seriously. You really. He's just, you, you, yeah. Well, right. You said that stuff that was on it. You just can't even believe it. Oh, I believe it. I miss you spend more of your time on the internet than I do. But I just can't believe these things. I can't believe these people. I mean, you know, it's one thing that's a look at somebody on TV and I've always joked about that about him in particular, but, but to be like that, obsessive in her like, and of course back and forth. See, that's the one thing about the internet, all these chat rooms. Basically, they're a bunch of desperate people shouting each other. Isn't that what it really boils? I would say that's a perfect description of it. Yeah. Desperados with no lives shouting each other. Well, I don't think he's gay. And I think he was married with 16 kids. And I think I saw him in a gay bar in Naples though. Right. Amazing. How much, you know, like the everybody brothers, all I have to do is dream. These people must spend a lot of time dreaming, which I guess you have to win year by always. I have no life. 18, before one at five, 60, WQM, we got Curtis and Mad Dog and we got UN baseball.

It's too late because I'm in the middle of the spot. And I don't know if this is the right tag or not. Because we don't get any more copy. I'm just asking if there was any like copy in the box.

And what's half time at check for public too and the US, Neil. Hey, Neil. This is Randy West. And as for our phone conversation, I talked to Peter North the other day. He tells me your real name is Neil Down. And he's still ain't interested. 418. 516. WQAM. Your headquarters for Tape Interviews with dumbass criminal athletes. The station that turned to for sport-hol sweepers. Followed by a much math dumbass. Sound like anyone you know. And if you think they're unintelligible just because of the phone. One no Charlie Radio. I'm a one no Charlie. 516 WQAM. K-Dreens are a demographic of underreducated degenerate gamblers, loyal to wealthy closet gay Republicans who still live with their mother and are too cheap to buy anything anyway. I like your back. You're dead. Well, hey. What a game last night, huh? Yeah. You're done interviewing WQAM. He said. Boy, whole radio. Is it anyone there? Why we're going out of this? Hey man. Man. Yeah. I think with a copy. I don't want to get off on a tangent here, but I will anyway. For George, he's always telling me. They don't speak our language. They don't speak our language. No, they don't. And that line that he gave me because he started doing the fact he was doing Tommy's job. Yep. When he first went over there and I had my seven months paid vacation. I was in Europe most of the time having a wonderful time. And he was over there and he every time I would talk to me and say, this isn't a radio station. It's a sports bar with a microphone. And he keeps reminding me that they don't speak our language. In other words, like when you're working a certain business, no matter what it is, there's a certain lingo that goes along like radio talk. Like when you were broadcasting, radio or TV talk. They don't speak that. So copy. I mean, copy what's that? You start up again? They just don't speak the language. It has got anything to do with broadcasting. That's all they know in there is for like the over's in the under's in who one the game and what was the score and who's the next is. It literally goof off. We're going to have one here. And that's all they know from. That's all they know. It's not a radio place. And of course, it goes to show how stupid an IEV I am. I thought that once Greg got the show about the door and they brought somebody else in, maybe that might change a little bit. Uh-uh. Uh-uh, because the new guy, he's just a face man. We got parents calling me, sure. Some parents makes magazine like a well-rounded individual, you know, by comparison. He's a handsome young man. He is a handsome young man and a handsome young sports nerd. Who that's all he knows about is taking showers with the guys in a locker room, I guess. Maybe they'd like to take a shower with a handsome young guy. I have no idea. I know I sure would. And I care and so. 1144 votes. It's a sports far with a microphone. They don't speak the language of broadcasting. No, they have that language I keep in mind. It's only right now. Let's keep these calls going. Otherwise, we're going to have to resort back to my pile again. I don't want to mess with the pile. You? Yeah. Not today. We've been on a roll. 567. They've been pretty good.

Now we can go back to that. If you go back to the NBA. The Tally's on the Disney. She uses a lot of time to, I wonder, I'm not exactly right. It was on his back lightly. They say lightly, but the referee sees that angle. Like with Debra Mariston. Because they had six-two to nine for Dallas. And that was not going to come. I was Tuesday games three. The series was shipped to my Abby for these three four and five. Thursday games four. They mixed Sunday games five. Course that it necessary. Our coverage would be going to be 20.

It's 16 and nine for the Mavericks. Yeah. Yeah, that's game two. What do you mean by that? In game two, the heat got blown out. Oh, you mean like last night? Absolutely. That's what I'm trying to, that's what I said before. You got me all called confused now. Like I really know what game two and game three. I know they're down two games.

I went about 15 seconds over and I felt really bad about that. And you want to know what the reason is for that? What's the reason? Because it's no damn rejoins. If they get a longer runner, we're going to be doing seven minute breaks on a show pretty soon. Thanks to Clarence and it was stupid as rejoins that go on and on and on. Yeah. I'm trying to back time figure we got a four, maybe four minute and twenty second break. It is man. You can take any break in a world of making it like a six, seven minute break.

You know, who's not living here from another planet. And here's Gajarma who's probably like in Budapest, or somewhere. And he's talking about the storm in Tampa and about to be better.

Those people are particularly concerned about what lies ahead and even Florida's governor talked about that. 560560, copy a dollar, radio a dollar, the only thing that's us is sports bar with a microphone. It's beginning to look at us at the governor. His head is probably about the size of a shaft. He went out of the coat of his head. After all, he did six to two thousand election him and Captain Harris. The mayor of the governor was not playing it with your son, Tampa. He wouldn't be bad if that was cancer and Harris' plane. I'd like to say the Republican Party, which is it was, but when it just crashed, Charlotte has been deferred. Oh my god, who the funcant? WQAM hello. WQAM hello. Yes sir. Hey, I'm not a country music fan, but I thought that there's a chick sitting in. It's a great idea to find out what it knows of. I got there by 10 of managers to piss off the bush family. I'm not going to be a part of them because, you know, they were right. And there's nothing wrong with being right. And the hardest thing for these right wing not to just admit they were wrong. And that's why they're constantly backering about this. But it's a never met they were wrong. It's pretty sad commentary when you got up. I'm using based on what the right wing tells you. Of course, everything else is the same way too, you know. Don't watch that curtain. I don't even love it. It's more that pet micolores propaganda right. Sure, whatever you say. 10 inches of rain may fall through water beach. Look at that sandbagging worth of Tampa. Would be the first time some of the people got sandbagged in Tampa.

There's a photo of a Charlie, the guy who didn't set their phone. Yeah. There's a front door, man. It's not really him. Okay. Okay. Now you probably do it something with it right now. There's something like an expert on blow up dolls. Here's the world cup again. They're back into the second half now. They're got the 51 minute mark. Let me. Still too nothing for the check. We've public over to USA. Oh, look at that. There's a US target. A bloody nose. They need to guys hold in his kishkis. Oh, you see that? So they're looking to keep up the hand again. They're asking. No, man. No, man. No, man. No, man. No, man. No, man. No, man. No. He's just some kind of a candy ass game. Is that what it is? Oh, God. No, Malice intended my ass. And the ball rolls back to the goalie and he'll probably like, oh, yeah. Oh, that's right. He's in a big hurry because that's the US goalie. So he like kicked it off. They're real quick. They kicked it about 10 yards and they got kicked it back to him again. And the clock is ticking and ticking. 51. 42. 51. 43. And now he kicks a prodigious kick man all the way down the field. And the check guy hits it with his head. Listen, just keep going with the play by play till like two. Wait there. Okay. You can see the field and he kicked it about four feet. Now he runs turns it goes the other way. That this is the worst crap I've ever seen in my life. How anybody can serve this to be a sport? You can swing. Oh, man. The beat. Hey, you can sit somewhere. You can play away. Always cross over. Always cross over. He janned the babies. You're tripped. You saw what happens to the fix the edge. If he feds the play. You turned them around twice. You turned them around twice. You turned them around twice. I thought something got a tough might do. When you stop, I heard that. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pompah. Dough. Good. This. 5, 60 on the horizon.

That would be a shame. We can only pray. Maybe that's what this is all about. Maybe God is trying to get her ugly ass. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Jesus is after you, Joyce. Anyway, all of this stuff is coming across and it's coming from the Southwest and man. It's going to rain here like right now there's basically nothing. And Dave Brower, maybe way out in West Palm Beach like out in Belgrade. Well, it's pretty crappy this past weekend. Yeah, but you ain't seen nothing yet. Just wait. You got some heavy, heavy duty rains coming to San Sioux, but it comes to a clock, man. You made it make a beeline out there. Two nearest sports for us. You can watch the rest of the soccer game. It'll be over by now. Okay. Well, you can watch the replay. Or maybe maybe this is some other good. I'm sure there may be some other great matches like Belarus and Slobovia. 54 or 20 they played, baby. We got a long way to go to the 190 minute mark. Plus than the extra time, right? Still two hours in front of the second public. Keep your hopes up USA. I'm got a Chinaman's Sands and Hell. WQAN. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Did you say that there was vacant ten inches in Tampa?

Now, or smell of, thank God. Uh, tell us how hard he was working to try to like develop some material or he was like, as he was going along and like, he was kind of improvising there. He struggled a little bit. He did, you're struggling, sir. He's probably even went out when he was a, he probably, that could be, and I understood there's a lot of pressure there when you get on the phone here, trying to, you know, conjure up some material, something to say, especially in Florida. But, uh, he, in fact, he's probably sniffing it right now and enjoying the hell out of it. Twelve minutes past one, did you take that copy and shove it up, uh, Craig's, answer, or anything else? Do you do it during the break, or time? Yeah. Take it back there and say, this is an example of why people, at least Neil gets all that other shape, is because few people sent him a bunch of soil and they were supposed to make magic with it. So damn good thing I know my roomy on Julietta's, Julienta. Oh, my, I know a few yentas, man, but they have a few juu yentas, but they're like in sunrise lakes.

I've asked for a few minutes of your time to discuss the reform of the Marquis immigration system. Mexico is our neighbor and our friend. America can be an open door to the future. The borders should be open to criminals, drugbears, and terrorists. The men and women of our border patrol are doing a fine job. And over the past five years they have apprehended and said home about six people in a manor at the illegally. And most are sent back home within 26 years. Thank you and good night. I've been in the US can't score, but they sure came, who did up just after I said they made their smashing guys across the head with their arms and nothing gets called because they got to keep that clock running.

Just all kinds of grotes. There's that ugly Chad Myers again. I guess they don't have to worry about it now because the rain is coming down. There'll be a lot of rain. The problem is if you have an 8 inch rainfall deficit, you can't make that back up with one 8 inch rainfall because half of it runs off. It doesn't really count to regenerate the groundwater. It doesn't really count for parts of Florida here. There have been two reports of tornadoes on the ground this morning and a couple of very large cells. Anytime you see the red around your area, you do want to keep it advised. You look around if you see the red around it, you're going to have real tourists coming.

Don't fall off. Mmm. Talk about week. Man, oh man, this is the last story we've had here. It's on it don't get no weaker than this. This is the lightning round. Yeah, this is the sad lightning round. One of the all time worst. Tell me the QAM, hello. Yes sir. I got to quick stories about how precarious our freedom is and this so called free country. My friend was at the Miami courthouse about a week and a half ago for a child custody case. There was a research for the child while he was waiting around. Some guy told the cops that he was one of three men that abducted him five months ago closing his police officers. They arrested my friend on the word. It's scumbag. It's never seen my friend in the life. See there we go. Can't say that. Not sad. That's very nice. I would have been talking actually his Georgia drop and hit the table. I mean because we had a dump that. Yeah, you know you couldn't say that. I don't want to say s-bag. That ridiculous. Ah, Tommy knows this ridiculous. Josh, court knows this ridiculous. You know, Roger knows this ridiculous. Everybody listening out into clean little children. Oh, it's ridiculous. But Joe Bell and Clara's there all. They don't know this ridiculous and that's because Joyce don't know it's ridiculous. We can't say, debag. We can't say s-bag and you wonder why I'm like psychotic. Who would have we don't? We couldn't have we can't say those. Yeah, well we can say scumb as in, you know, like when you put the chicken soup in the uh, refrigerator overnight, the container and you get that later scumb on top and we can say bag is it's in the bag boy. But we just can't say them together. See that is they get a real good education. We haven't heard this week seeing how low that they've uh, and they've just they've taken all the way. Am I turning by the way after that great one hour meeting on Friday reports that Clara's there was a handsome young man. We're the equipment don't work. Yeah, that's no way. So, you want to get married? Let me give you some advice. If you want to be a holy, vulnerable, or a single life, always make it your wish. And you know why both from the time personal and no different. Yeah, that's just a miracle. If you wish, why both of them are a good, or a single life, always make it your wish. And you know why both from the time personal and no different. You should never marry a Jew. If you wish, why both of them are good. I can't pick up anything else. All she ever wants to do is shop. She got credit card in the list. Show us no interest at all in six. She only came about your bitch. You are never gonna get late. You'll be better than you make it. If you want to be a holy, vulnerable, or a single life, always make it your wish. And you know why both from the time personal and no different. Yeah, that's just a miracle. If you want to be a holy, or a single life, always make it your wish. And you know why both from the time personal and no different. You should never marry a Jew. When your honeymoon is finally through, there are things you never gonna do. You only came about your nails and hair. And I'd love to bet about what's down there. You are gonna feel like the smuck, because you're never gonna get to. But now how it feels to be, you're in a big breakfast and set a birth seat. If you want to be a holy, or a full rest of your life, always make it your wish. And you know why both from the time personal and no different. Yeah, that's just a miracle. If you want to be a holy, or a single life, always make it your wish. And you know why both from the time personal and no different. You should never marry a Jew. You're married. Okay, so I'll ask you to do. We miss a spot there or something there at the end or is that just my imagination? I think I just forgot to hit the plus on the rejoin. Also, it was yours, your bad. And here, blame it a crappy equipment that we got there. You're gonna be a big hero. Yeah, the equivalent sucks. Anyway, so a 124-8 votes on a pool. The woman that I despised the most. And colder man, there's nobody even close to that bitch. That's sour. That 639 votes, 549%. Kind of leaves at 164. Hello, we've Clinton 115. Let me see, is the game over now?
