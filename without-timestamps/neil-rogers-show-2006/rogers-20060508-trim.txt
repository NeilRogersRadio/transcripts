Yeah, everybody's very excited about tonight. That's the thing he pulled me. I couldn't care less. It's a big thing down here. Well, you keep telling yourself that, and personally you believe it. That's true. Yeah. Just like our two to four segment, it's a big thing down there, you know? No. I'm just talking about what's happened tonight. Yeah. It's the playoffs. And why don't they get those slots started down there? July. Spose your why? That's what I hear. July of what year? This year. Okay. That's what they're planning. Hopefully before the Marlons moved to San Antonio. That's not happening. The fifth week for the Marlons moved to Hylia. The fifth thing is the deadline for that. And the Marlons struck out in the legislature in 15th. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. You're boy very this morning, but I mean, but I would. But about the David Simpson says, this is the same old stuff. Very that temp. Yeah. Well, yeah, I said that they've on Friday. I said the Kentucky Derby descent part of it is that it's not a really fair race. There's too many horses in it. Yeah. It's all about road trouble. It's all about traffic. It was about. When you were out of three high-end leaders. The horse I like. The traffic was like nine wide in the bay. Yeah. Well, it was wide the whole period of time. That's why that's why I told you that post position was going to kill him. You did? No, I didn't. I said that. I haven't talked to you. I told the public. I was on top of it. I didn't tell me that. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I mean, it's you. I was in the middle of a long marathon. It would buy. But the horse I had. Steppenwolf. I had him in the exacto with the bar row. He'd be violent. Anyway, he had a terrible trip. He got caught up in. He got hit early and then. Get carried wide. He had to. This is why he should be limited to 12. You know, we passed that point of recession. Not you and I, but a bunch of us were talking about that. You know what? That's what makes it Kentucky. They're a respecial. Yeah, you got to have a lot of luck and you got to be really tough to win. That's not what makes it special. It's what makes it an unfair race. The race is supposed to be like the determine who's the best, not who gets the best luck. Well, usually the best tourist wins. I think the best tourist won this race. I don't think so. I don't think he's going to win no triple crown. I don't know about that, but I think it went to pre-miss. Really? Yep. The circle kick his ass. You like brother Derek and I'm not so sure about that. Okay, brother Derek can only run one way. I don't know why he keeps saying that. I look at the chart. He can't run only one way. He comes from off the pace around the lead. If you look at the chart, he's coming close to races and one. Isn't that that lead? He's total speed in California. He's California speed. Okay. And he's, that's the case. And how come he closed from like nine wide and finishing the did heat for fourth? He just ran, you know, he didn't touch, you know, but he touched him. He was outside the whole way. He was wide, but he was beaten by about 15 lanes. Yeah. Yeah. On about next to 8th of a mile anyway. He was beaten 15 lanes. Yeah. Okay. We'll see when they get to a pimlico. We'll see. When they get to Balmer. I'll read you what happened to the horse in the race. Brother Derek worked his way. Six wide by the first turn moved out wider when to feel the punch. Yeah. Nearing me into the back stretch, band out nine abreast when making a serious run and the upper stretch became empty while finishing for it. Yeah. Right. Came up empty. So he's a nice horse, brother Derek. But I don't think he's as good as this one. This horse just won with ease. I mean, he was effortless. Well, you know, you're going to get sucked in like we do every year, year after year. All here's a great, you know, an addition to which everybody was talking about how contentious the field is. It's possible to rest of the horses and just don't really all like good. No, I think he's good. I think it was a good field. I think, you know, a lot of these horses. You know, I mean, you're right. When you have 20 horses in a race, it's like a pretty simple father and jump. Bob and John is a good horse. Right. Bob and John never had a chance. He seemed to hit the board. He was nowhere. He got crushed coming out of the gate. Well, there you go. But that could happen in the 10 horse race. But much less likely. Highly unlikely. Highly silencing. Well, what happened? I'll tell you what happened to Bob and John. And it could have happened, like I said, in the 10 horse race. When key entry came out of the gate, he killed Bob and John. Just knocked almost knocked him off his pants. And that was the end of Bob and John. I kicked you ass. Boy or Ron, that no excuse. He was in a good position. That was a horse. I like he just did have it. Yeah, that was the other one I picked. I picked those three. Brother Derek on top and I know those two for the triple. I didn't hit that one. He hit the board. He can't not be. And that easy to do that. I've been that. I think he picked anybody hit the board. Barbero. I had what I did was my betting strategy was I took step and wolf for and lawyer Ron and box them and exact is with Barbero and point determine. And it was you. Oh, and Bob and John. And better off a bit on Bob and Tom. And I, you know what, if step and wolf for. Oh, if, oh, yes, if. If step and wolf for RAN third. You know, I had a shot. Exactly. I ran first and third. Come on. I'm not there. Oh. About as much as they pay for not having horses hit the board. Right. That's, that's exactly correct. Yes. The zippony do do do. I did hit the double, though. Well, that's good. I paid $60. How to 16 hour marathon. It would buy my longest, uh, lunacy of Mr. My life Saturday. You'll five a.m. The nine p.m. I know is the general manager. I was there longer than I was. The guy who's the general manager would buy him. Yeah. and introduced himself to me. I was during the telekate. Oh, I had a given the message for him if I didn't own that. I never saw the guy. He's a judge. I gave him a message. What do he have to say? He just walked over so I just wanted to do myself from the to my edge or would bind. Yeah. That was it. Tell him gambling is one thing. Steering is only. Anyway, was there for 16 hours? I lost 100 bucks. That's pretty good in it. I'm not gambling anymore. Charles Barclay has it right. When you when you don't win that much. Yeah. He was talking about John Daley's book. We're John Daley's last $60 million. And one thing Barclay said is true. John Daley hasn't lost $60 million. Gambling. He doesn't have $60 million. Well, he probably can't remember. Oh, he's got a problem. That's true. But Barclay was saying. What difference is it make? Charles Barclay? Who cares about that jackass? You know, if you're losing money that you can't afford to lose, then it's a problem. It's another story. Yeah. Well, he's a big game. If you're gambling for the fun of it for the halibut, then it's another story. Well, Barclay can afford it. Well, they're like I said. So what's he whining about? He's not whining. I'm whining about that damn very bonds. I'll say, I love that. I love and fully that big sign they had out there in the bleachers. Yeah. Babe Ruth did it on $2.00 in beer. That was great. That says like me. $2.00 in beer? That's how I do it. Well, that's so much beer. They should love hot dogs. Yeah, the ballpark. Yeah. Ballpark race track. He'll tell you we got our ballpark. Oh, by the way, what the hell was their Martha? That was your name. They might are good friends at the colder. Oh, yeah. Mickey. Mickey and Martha. There was a the two of them. Yeah. Mickey was the one. Mickey always says she's still asked about you. She's still there. She works at the, I mean, I haven't seen her call. She used to and Martha was the other one. Yeah, he's technically. She was great. Yep. I remember Martha. Martha was also works at Hailea. Yep. Well, maybe she could work at the ballpark when they get in. And then when they started serving the green weenies at Hailea, that's a red about the 10-day get-way to close down. So you're laughing, you know, on your face. I know. Oh, my God. Why I'm laughing? What the hell was that all about? Oh, man. I mean, I know that they have to destroy some horses, but they have to serve it up to the public. That was bad. That place became so filthy, man. We like a pigsty. Thank you, John Bernetti, for destroying a beautiful, beautiful place. I remember that time I was like, look at idiot on the air, try like rally around. I have no idea why I did that either. Of course, your buddy, your good post-personal friend, Vic Stofor, talking me into doing that. And Bob Savage, Reston piece. Please, Bob, as a good guy. Yes, you was. Vic Stofor is a jackass. Yes, you were. He's got to make it pictures man. How he could be calm, how he would park. He is so, oh, just... Yeah, he's been in Hollywood park. His own, oh well, it's not anymore. It was owned by Churchill Downs. So he was working for the two rival companies, you know, streaming me an owned by a strong. Ah, how he had he pulled that off. He wants, he wants so bad to be time-dirken. What's it? What's it? What's it? What's it? What's it? What's it? What's it? What's the car race? I beg your pardon? I didn't see it. I saw the replay and see the race though. And in fact, they were reshawing it with funny, because they reshawed the stretcher on, I wanted the channels here, and they said, and here were the call of the... I think was the Buffalo channel. And he said, here were the call of stretcher on his Dave Johnson. Of course it was Durkin, but it's a thought was amusing. See, Dave is not anybody's mind. What it comes to horse racing is greatest Durkin is everybody thinks. month they've gone. I did the draw show with Dave on Wednesday. We had a great time. And pretty capacella. And it is now post time. I told you to capacella. So yeah, you sustain in the corner the press box after you retired and every time that's the moment. You're here in this voice. Like Ernie had called her, man. I wish you the I guess you never encountered him. Boy, this is the funniest guy in history of the race track. He was great. He would sit there before the race and call a fictitious race. It's just everybody would be just peeing in their pants. He was the funniest guy. And he would call him like a Freddie capacella. High fall set of voice. And they're off. And then he would talk to him. Put you like this right? He had a real deep deep voice and real life. And I don't even put you like this race. Now I just crack up. He was funny. He's dead. He used to wear our girl socks. I guess it's not a good idea to wear our girl socks. I used to wear our girl socks a long long long long long time ago. Yeah. How were any socks? You haven't worn socks in years. I can't. I can't. I can't wear socks. I get like the marks that cut self my circulation. That's where my feet are so beautiful. I don't want to fight to my diabetes. I don't wear socks. I wore socks. I'd be dead. Two things if I was in Florida or if I wore socks. If I would both of them might have been dead a long time ago. There are things that the station's the seven's gone. I can't play those sounds anymore. At the Saturday night attorney is filing a $10 million lawsuit against Joyce Fitch. She doesn't have that kind of money. At 330 the Saturday night attorney has been selected to file a $200 million lawsuit against Joyce Fitch for interfering with the show. But I found out I'm very good authority that she hates me like poison and is purposely sandbagging the show. She'll do anything in her power to try to get me to fail. That's it. I'm not making that up. That's a true story. How do you like that? How do you like to work for people like that? I do. Fitch rhymes with bitch. I do. That's what you do do. I'll tell you those two to four hours are pretty impressive. This coming from the new general manager who one of the first things he said to me is well we're not in any hurry to replace a mole because how much worse can we do than he did? Well I guess we're fighting out. Yeah, maybe he was irreplaceable. Who's that? Well I don't understand what that means. Oh he was irreplaceable. I said, I said, yeah. I said, I'm going to go so dirty. I saw him last week at the golf tournament. No, come on. Yep. And I don't know if he spoke to anybody else. He didn't speak to me. Oh, he didn't speak to you. Or cop. The only guy he spoke to was Miguel. And all of a sudden he saw a mole. Yep. There he was. He didn't speak to you. Did he see you? That's your kind of hard to miss him. He was doing a radio show from the right. And he was there and he didn't even speak. What a bastard. What a hard ass. What a break. Yeah, you had a lucky break. Yep. I'd been a little bit insincere. Well listen, don't cash all those tickets too fast. Now keep him in. I've got, you know what? I've got a double ticket and I've got an exact ticket from the woodford reserve race to cash because the lines were long. Do I mean, tell me we're going to run that guy from woodbine if he had been sick. Because that would be a mess. Yeah. I beg God. I didn't. I didn't know him. He just walked up and said hello. Yeah. Here comes the bunny and there goes your money. I got news for it. You can play this for 16 hours. You only lose 100 bucks. That's pretty good. You're a genius. Although I was 15 hundred out of the first two hours, but I didn't run out. I want to spoil all my day. And two times I got up two times within an hour. I got up and left the machine and moved the one extra and somebody came and played the one I was just off and hit two grand twice. When that happens, it's like a message. Yeah. It's been a nice night. Nice night. I didn't. Had a wonderful time. Well listen, have a great day and that we sure would be tuning in for two to four for somebody has to. Why?

brother he is the easy real evil door just a the butcher of the Honduras anyway let's pay the news day rights have the washman media harness themselves to closely the president George W. Bush this odd couple in pairs to take an a tenured skydive out of the plain phone by comedian Stephen Colbert the recent one has course upon center the company central host of the Colbert report with the featured in the tainer with the washman affair where seven twelve hundred journalists share a ceremony evening in airplane hangar of a ballroom on a date not with the significant other but with the new source uh cloister justices of the supreme court of the known with tenors journalist svaray along with ambassadors spies industrialist cabinet members admiral's high clergy major generals and members of congress along with their lobbyists and recent years this gathering has been sorted with hobby would act here's marquee athletes and celebrities of all stripes the city US president the first lady always attend to say the real spring ritual so that the moved and shaken of the media can pre-in before the truly powerful after being shot in march 30th 1981 a recoup rating Ronald Reagan telephone as regressed to the dinner this likely marked an uptick in Reagan's press cover coverage no one remembers a single line to the comedian in the performer of the 81 dinner but this year Stephen Colbert shed a the tradition of comedic politeness i attended the 81 dinner the washman elite was sent by its lily whiteness among the twenty four hundred power diners there were eight African merchants including the news day national editor from the europe the pro-real heard in Jordan and got only knows why boxer Floyd Patterson perhaps i should stay here i did not attend this year's dinner the colbert transcripts lies c-span performance is a side splitter instead of rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic he has this soaring bushwood house rearranging with a chairs on a hidden bird the humor however collapsed like the derogable on the live dinner audience hence i must part company with my colleague some of whom went petty one dc calmness nil colbert for a mixed metaphor the performance before the present was hilarious it was also courageous sadly and moved to hazard a guess is to why the attending journalist didn't dare for method self-slap at colbert in public first let's stipulate that the republicans at the day didn't laugh because they were the bus of the jokes colbert for example suggested and they nod the device present someone should be in the face he's deemed all the bush administration lighting up occasionally with the touch of dead on comedy comedic irony if anybody needs anything else a debate table speaks slowly and thoroughly into your table numbers somebody from the NSA will be right over with a cocktail next way after a set that colbert's with his comedy central cohort john steward has become something of a rival the television newscasters a growing number of young americans for worse not better granted the pen on this duo for their news in pursuit of this audience politicians and other news makers hold their noses and submit to guest appearances on colbert show Daniel elzberg who leaked the pentagon papers to the press 1971 so he preferred appearing on comedy central shows because the mainstream media news media simply run handouts from the bush white house these days colbert level elzberg charged directly a fox news at the intern slightly praised news press coverage of the NSA wiretapping and secretly was prisons at eastern europe then they've been a set of the media colbert is misdemeurs demographers who take down fiction from the president pass it off his facts colbert was no laughing net in the washman press corps and a delicious touch of irony he later said on the TV show that the enduring washman audience practically carried me out on their shoulders even though I wasn't ready to go during the evening for quality colbert's biting went lancely elicit relationship between the media and those day are charged to cover bush has sunk beneath the possibility of satire the media must be careful not to stumble beyond the reach of irony well said there are less the less said the better 723 votes on our poll will make that thousand i think i'd be thinking it's only eleven o eight other than bush and cheney which government official you will miss trust the most 753 order i'm telling you man side by each those two nazis there you see that wow that's it there all christry twenty five dollar

thousand lick I can't believe it give me a good pull for tomorrow and I'll go to woodbind why that's the toughest thing about this about why come up with a poll I'll do in the show you mean yeah I forgot to tell you all summer you're doing all the pool oh yeah it's a joke it's a joke it's a joke it's a joke days when I work I do my own poll oh sorry that's right uh giving me a good poll I don't have full what's your favorite action movie okay I like that also anyway I didn't mention about this movie did I I threatened to do it which one yeah oh no you threatened that's it that's all you did I told you about it and you said you thought you're seeing it and then maybe you didn't I didn't Laura Lenny's and she is not hot you know I mean an actress doesn't have to be hot to be good actress I know that the Davis was a good actress don't Crawford was a good actress there were about as hot as an ice cube they don't have to be hot but it helps well well it's another reason to watch right it kind of like the lures you into a watch and for you to see why that's why watch that movie incredible uh I can't ever think of the name of that movie mr. what's it going to weaver and email her signing her at my favorite here imagine your heroes I got hooked into that because of poor little amaler I thought why I one thing I came to mind you're fair now that wasn't it yeah was but anyway the same thing is a movie that had promise you know in other words that that should say it all sure had promise could have been good but it wasn't it with ps would lower-litty and like silent hill which I went to the theater to see that and to offer grace supposed to be scary but guess what who to offer grace isn't it by she's a great actress and I never had seen her before she's very good in this and no she does not well she gets naked be an old scene often I said he gets naked all these years like from you know from the uh puppet up which was pretty good as a matter of fact took a shirt off and I was in shock I thought man what if he and asking kuchi kuchi ever got naked together but anyway he's pretty good actor he's all right and it's been never seen him on his head horrible horrible the world of worst show that nasty uh oh those 70s show well you forget you saw that you saw him in traffic but you forgot maybe I saw that so long that's right I saw him in traffic I didn't hear random over but anyway he was good and but the problem was it's just I don't know it was like I needed another half an hour okay nothing really happened in other words this is a lot of movies like that like recent other one of those deals where she she lost her boyfriend in a high school got killed as name was Scott and his guy's name is f scott which is real name is franny and they call him franny but uh the part about to be incarnation thing that she thought it almost everything got mentioned huh where she thought it was him because he looked so much like her boyfriend in the high school and she was like 39 he was about like early 20 if you know college student and they were doing it and at the end uh like uh they're still doing it and they you know they're out there out in the further whatever the school then she's gonna see him later and he walks off at a big smile on his face in turns about hey I'll see you later and she uh that's it go don't don't you hate that you know at the end of almost every movie a lot the scene ends and you hold your breath thinking okay no the the screen goes black now right it's coming was that really the end you know I'm talking about yeah you're a dumb-on-a-screen goes black and there's another scene right but even just a little epilogue or something but we just know that there's nothing else coming the feeling of dreadstakes and yeah like that's it uh uh is that like Peggy Lee was he is this that all there is I just wasted two hours for that it was worth it wasn't very long either was uh you know that's a problem you neither have found her but I guess they couldn't figure out what to do you know I guess is more of the same okay pull let's see what's your favorite action movie you may find me to do with that I don't want what I think I did that once and you made fun of me once for doing that all the time I don't really care okay I don't know I don't really care I'm getting a splitting headache from the show today just from the whole ambia I'm so everything talking about Oscar de la wholeia who gives a crap about Oscar de la wholeia you see the fight you see the fight that's part of being a man in America you have to watch the fight and of course the quotes around the fight whatever the fight is the fight through your I'm gonna watch the fight when Josh starts to get into with with who I'm off he's entrainin training for what for how he's wearing a training bra that's a problem you see now come on come up with a pull let me see if let's do it right on the year all right I'm turned that before some people in the audience you got a good idea you mean besides turn we signed yeah I'm looking for the latest bunch of shans full I think they sucks it all look at that put way down there well look there's no such thing as a you know ever flowing well or whatever that means anyway there was a guy sitting next to me at woodbanger bay he leaned the healing over and sneak one and right away direction to me was an editorial comment that's so rude just supposed to lean the other way yeah no there was a guy on the other side to me like him better I don't know now what what tell us that I mean it was so obvious to me to realize and then he dealt it nice method god what is that oh no there was one guy playing all the city ran and I thought oh I know why he ran I could smell it that's bad the biggest suit of intellectual actually this is pretty good oh I see what was the greatest album that that's too complex for now nobody doesn't have any more anyway right what's the rudest thing people do that's I like that like that one has one of the shans yeah you want me to tell you what he's got here sure flaunt their wealth whiz on the toilet seat bother people in the bathroom I don't know what that means bothered people in the bathroom like talk to somebody well they're you know you look at some glory oh bad that's a toilet talk what I didn't hear nothing repeat that talk loud on the red eye flight or steel parking spaces yeah that's a good pull right the rudest thing I got a suggestion well wait a minute let me write this down you know we got plenty of time here you don't want to take these stupid ass calls do you know it's short show today at least it started at 10 30 yeah see there goes you're doing not gonna hang you know you're so phony to his face you always suck up because you know the crossover to when I'm not doing I like hang a lot I do like a lot hang but I like to bring up the crossover locker you do what I said I like killing time a lot with the crossover too that that's not why I do it I do it because they want us to do it that's why because current six is certainly not helping hang because it's all my time I do it because it's easy all my time if we were doing it during his time maybe might help a little bit you know but it sure's how it's gonna happen his number which you know said it mentioned I was gentile enough not to mention anything about his number I concentrate most of that on two to four eight oh eight on the pull by the way let's let's get to a fifty we were gonna go away over a thousand and I think during the break I might have to write out into a joys really yeah I think all of the sudden getting inspired to do it hey would lightning quickspeak I'm in a wrong spot here oh well what where did this come from I don't understand what how

Yeah, of course Yeah, and it's rude and people know the answer sleeping in the other room and they're you know jam in the stereo and talking loud and or blur in the TV like you know being loud while people are trying to sleep yeah people are sleeping. I don't like well That's what I best I can do if you can shorten it up that's fine, but I evidently not so being loud Rough people are sleeping. Okay. I thought you said you had one was that the one oh no no cutting in line Whether it's at the supermarket or in terms of immigration cutting in line. Yeah, that's gonna get a lot of votes Yeah, I love that one good choice. They're a judge like my favorite You go to the supermarket and somebody standing in front of you in line with nothing and then you think that There's no problem like parting in public. Yeah, you think they're gonna get a magazine or something like that No, they're just holding the line for their partner who has the cart overflowing with stuff that's gonna cut in front of you Yeah Oh, and so speaking of that whatever the hell I want one bit was a two-bit's back Paramount pictures and a seating star Tom Cruise failed to live up to expectations this weekend when mission impossible Three open two week numbers oh yeah at the domestic boss or a fist despite a barrage of pubic appearances By Mr. by Miss Cruz to throw up the film. Hey Tommy you fairly you can not kid anybody in mole The poor opening followed nearly a year public mocking of Mr. Cruise how to with most reliable Star and the centerpiece of Paramount's biggest franchise across the pop culture landscape by internet bloggers and late night comedians and constantly on tabloid covers After his public over the top wooing of actress Katie Holmes and his outspoken remarks against side-kind Wean anti-depressive medications still last year You're not full anybody any more Tommy that whole sign-tallogy thing, you know Pres everybody saw that soft sarcasm so whether I such kids like to or not too bad that if they didn't they ought to they ought to over and over again I didn't know that Oprah had a talking breakdown. I know she talked through it many times It'd be surprised what to talk opening in 4,000 plus theaters mission impossible three and estimated ticket sales 48 million dollars for the weekend almost 10 million hour less than the second mission impossible movie in 2000 see to me I'd have a lost in him so it's just like the Kentucky derby. I can just you know bus people's balls I didn't watch the race but to say to me mission impossible is the TV show just like Batman Yeah, I did see a couple of the Batman movies and very disappointed because they have nothing to do with bat Man, there's a Batman movie from about 1970 that's two hours of in fact it was on the other day in my cable Mm-hmm and it had all the all the evil doers I'm wearing like a submarine See that they type things yeah Penguin the pink ones on there in the riddle and the didler and the Joker and they're all on there together And Robin and Robin's got his knickers in a not and his tights to I mean That's Batman so mission impossible with Peter Graves and What's your name Barbara baby and her former husband Martin Linda Martin Landial and Greg Morris and the other big Goofy guy was like sliced along. What's his name? I think he's dead. Oh, I don't know based on market research to film had been expected to reach about 65 million But only 48 million pretty week time a pretty pretty week Many in Hollywood but watching expect it. We see if the negative publicity surrounding miscrues What have it affected the box orifice and this weekend? It appeared as if it had good top on that couch one more time you jackass you Perm out reported that mission impossible three took an 118 million worldwide in 15 55 countries doing well in a Jullette and Merck and Britain and probably in Germany Austrian Switzerland where there's public opposition Mr. Cruiser championing of his religion Scientology. I don't know wonder I liked your money so much and Switzerland Maybe the Schweites, maybe that's where it's at what do you like better Schweites or Schweites? Schweites but apparently he said Mr. Cruiser's public image didn't hurt to film I don't believe that this is a factored by my way Other is disagree noting Mr. Cruiser personally spearheaded the marketing campaign he visited many countries Mappets access to that they opening going to Rome Paris London, Mexico City and I'm Friday attended four different careers And Manhattan alone traveling by helicopter fire truck SUV and a whole bunch of other crap And a promotional blitz across the city even in a boat The only X factor here is Tom Cruise that Paul their Garb Bidian present these evitivations Okay screw him Now there's a guy we've done that pull before somebody used to like and how you can't stand he's definitely one of them or her cannot stand him God he just gives me shpilkeys. I would watch him movie. He was in even in the old ones The only movie I would watch was losing it and I'd pretend he was now. Yeah, I like the board on the 4th of July still No, that's a good movie. No, he and Rainman was a great movie. Yeah, I'm not saying they ever made any good movie Oh, he can be a good idea Personally is just so a plug plus you know something is always the same He's like the Spencer Tracy of this era. He's always a Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise And the best example of that is Rainman. It's it's basically Tom Cruise and I return to Dustin Hoffman What it is a good movie though and of course a lot of it centers around Las Vegas and Kmart and Cincinnati Too bad to bed that weren't at Walmart. He could have said Walmart sucks. Yeah, I guarantee if he would have said Walmart sucks today And they showed that movie they get a standing govation. I stand up and cheer I'd be raising fingers all over the place 1143 17. They'll noon a QAM So we got that pull on and rude rude things people do Could also add some crap on there if we want during the show today or not we can wait till tomorrow We still have today.

Okay, I was wondering if I could make a request for one of your set tires that I actually please Not no Let's see here's a fact there from what it was awfully polite about it though and I guess I wasn't No, it's not an honest answer the answer is absolutely positive way I got going on here and we're not gonna just stop there. Now we're not doing that request today. Okay That's when George is on the summer. We'll do that every day. Yeah, right 800 and 6 is we vote on a poll. Let's see what I hate like poise now under the ambition Cheney who's the who do you think's the biggest who do you miss trust the most the geishmok they're all crooks 365 Keep people healthy and sad with Donald Rumsfeld 7 Jeff Bush all man 102 fat ass governor What's he gonna do after is this term expires?

I got that story The basic product That would be like miss fudge coming out Hillary Clinton 72 condolese 52 Alberto Vio 5 Gonzalo 17 John McCain 17 I hate this pool 15 and Johnny Grapotti only 14 because they have no idea who that is bald-headed Nazi Colonel clink he belongs in a clank Anyway, somebody facces and said is mission impossible the big guy was Peter Lupus. You're absolutely correct. Remember him? I got the disease And the original team leader before graves a later played the DNA and law and orders is telly. Well, telly. Thanks, paly I knew like that. Hi, paly Okay, so my Peter Lupus. So I guess we got him all right. So we didn't get him all there was one other guy I was gonna not cheat. Uh-oh now there was one other when we left out Martin land down Greg Morris Barbara Bane Peter Lupus Peter Graves I'm almost tempted to play the theme now. I'm so whipped up about this. I love that I love the theme That shows a great show and the idea that Tom Cruise somehow has got anything to do with the real mission impossible So ludicrous, you know ludicrous ludicrous in it there it is Well, we're version of this. Oh, I don't like it. I got several of it Oh, this is being moving very good Oh my god, man You know this computer so slow Why would you do that for him playing these themes? Oh, I can probably find one here Oh the quadts get Okay So anyway, like I said, I wouldn't watch them. We was even a Tom Cruise Ward and I'm, you know, although I've prepared it to be a better chance, but I just, I'm not in the movie we make of TV shows. Because they generally like to be wished. I didn't see that and I read that it was a piece of crap. Oh, it was brutal, I didn't even see it. The monsters, I read that it was a piece of garbage. They read it, monsters. Was it the monsters? No, not the monster. It was the other one. The animals. I'm sorry. I never liked the TV show anyway. Do you like the TV show? The animals. Yeah, that was all right. You really? Yeah, and then of course, the monsters was your buddy. You're looking for glory holes. Grandpa. Yeah. Abraham was 79 votes on the pool, but better get with it. We're going to do that one tomorrow. The rudest thing people do. Maybe some people will call in. How about burping out loud? You know, the Dutch, they do that without without any guilty conscience. Yeah, I don't care. As long as I'm not like downwind of a real greasy garlic belt or something, we all, they don't care. They, uh, they built silver. In fact, I think maybe it's like an intero comment. Like you boy, this meal was sure good. Eh. You don't like that. Speaking of that, Israel's most sought secret service agent, C. Killed A. Palustinian, wanted her airplane hijackings by feeding him, poisoned bells in chocolate over six months in the late 70s, according to a new book, the office said Saturday. All right. And as soon as I saw the headline, I thought to myself, one name came to mind you. Who was? Uh, what's his name with the Godfather? No. Are you thinking of you like, Walla? Yeah, yeah, that's no. Yes, you're on a fart. All the yet the slow poisoning. Yeah, interestingly enough, when you get to the mystery, talks about that. The book striking back is apparently the first time that details of the killing of coming to light and provide a glimpse and how sophisticated Israel is at poisoning. So if Shire leave, he is still there. By the way, I think he's gone. No, he's here. He's still there. Where does he work? And he's not in the morning anymore. Now he, uh, he does updates and he's the more than reporter. He offers you any food at the games, random. I'll say, I'll, I'm sorry, I'm kosher. Right. In his book, author Aaron Klein describes how Israel tracked down Wadiya Hadad, an operative of the popular frontful liberation of Palestine, not to be confused with the, uh, not so popular front for the, uh, that's that money Python thing, just in Christmau. People's the front of the GD. Right. In fact, that Hadad had gone into hiding in the Iraqi capital. If there's you'll begin killing Palestine in militants around the world, Klein told us you're a radio suspected in multiple hijackings, including the 76 take over an air France airplane and, and heavy Uganda. Hadad knew from the Israel attack, thick study could be shot or bombed as he walked the street or even picked up a phone. Just like an enemy with a rob low, old on step on a break. Remember that? Yes. Yes. Hadad was cautious of every move of avoiding travel outside of Iraq said Klein, a time X and correspondence in Jerusalem, but the 39-pound food lover had a weakness, chocolate, Ray Nagan was on to him. In fact, that in 77, the Lusheries like fine chocolates were rare. Through a Palestinian working with him, Assad would've gotten close to Hadad. He was able to feed him chocolate, rougher Belgium, and spread with poison over six months. He died March 78, showing only signs of leukemia, but no signs of poisoning. Hadad like that. Who? Since the death of Yasser Amafar in late 2004, rumors of swirling in the Arab world that long time Palestinian leader was poisoned by Israel. I don't think there's any doubt. Klein said there's no evidence that is your killer. Fahat would take years to prove that poison in front of a place because of Israel's sophistication. Error Farad died in a parasolable in 2004, but he was a stroke and followed a sudden deterioration in his health, unexplained. Medical workers have been inconclusive about the cause of that leading some palaces to implicate Israel. Klein's book recently came out in Israel in Hebrew. Bahru Khatah, Tony Tachaklet, Tidstray, etc. I like that. I like the name of the book. So the Israelis are poisoning people. Nothing worth important. What's that? What? Gears? I thought tapping on my door. I'm sitting here my underwear. That would not be good. We're nasty sight.

effort when he come right down it's like a take a gas there you go bitter battle brewing over smiley face uh oh for decades the yellow happy space symbol has encouraged millions to smile have you ever smiled when you saw smiley face no I haven't either so I don't know what that means oh it's encouraged people that mean that it achieved the year goal the smiley face and have a nice day you have to define the sevenies have a nice day with two dots in a pencil stroke school children have bright and head written messages by filling in their oh is with many smiley they fill in their oh these days nearly a cherry email is complete with a they type of graphical smile can I ask you a question yeah because I'm supposed to be somewhat computer literate and I do you know send a few emails here and there but uh how do you do that where does that come from the little smiley face then yeah well it's it's software now though the actual graphic one you see that somewhere the little yellow one yeah it depends on the program that they're using to create the email and you probably have an option on the hot mail which you use yeah probably have a little option there it's little box that you click on and uh oh well not that I would use it right uh it brings up the options for you but a bitter legal battle over smiley could be enough to make the happy little symbol frown uh oh Walmart stores which uses a yellow happy face to try to put a chopper's neck carefree mood is saying with the straight face that it has exclusive rights to the familiar image at least among retail department stores I totally their evil while is the the world's largest retailer is fighting a French native who is in millions and licensing fees on smiley since the early 70s when it begins to green trade marks for the happy face around the world it's the case of mischievous smiley versus lace miley or that lace smelly the two sides are expected to wrap up their cases before the West pendant trademark or fist is summer see these are the kind of things we ought to be worried about not who wants to say it as fight asker they love why am I asked asker they love oh yeah even a retailer is recently suggested drop mischievous smiley from its advertising as part of larger attempt to appeal to more off scale shoppers hasn't dulled Walmart's fighting spirit if Walmart prevails a computer is from festuing the symbol on plastic bags name badges and just anything else sold in stores the freshman Franklin Lou Franny responded bluntly without a happy face no comment but Walmart spokesman john smiley not to be confused with smiley was happy to it's kind of ironic that this oldest food is about a smiley face he said but in the end in the end back home it's what it is it's a market we have tremendous investment in is very close to identified with our company this is the first time I've heard that do you ever assume that the smiley face and Walmart were like anything to do with each other do I do that they use it I mean that they stole it I hear they're gonna try to copyright the star the checkmark next yeah Walmart and these swastika although for some best at billions of dollars to the years smiley said linking it's named the yellow circle with two dots for eyes and a loopy grin the company says it's been using what it calls mystery smiley since 1996 and more limited ways long before that but the company didn't move to register the trademark till somebody else threatened to do so first smiley said that was the franny who began registering that that was the guy's name the character in that movie franny was his name franny all right in ps it's okay it just doesn't go anywhere it doesn't you know it's no point to it they did it and they liked it and he liked her and she liked him and he wasn't her old boyfriend from high school and that's pretty much it that was the franny who done it who began registering the face around the world more than 30 years ago not to the man instead of a company in London smiley world the police had used many people have claimed to have invented smiley but the man widely credited with creating smiley was the late Harvey ball that's right nice and choose what said that's right do you know that said did oh Massachusetts graphic artist was commissioned by an insurance 1963 to reduce bad blood among employees after the company we merged with the rival original concept was just for a smile ball told the telegram and cassette of Worcester mass 97 that he ended the eyes so they disquerted employee couldn't turn this smile upside down to make a frown that was clever that was good to take in use yeah what a what a freaking genius for his efforts ball earned more than a song in the smile 45 bucks whatever by half a tank against by the time ball thought to cut and ever tell you about the time I was driving the wrong way on trim on street and Boston with my corvary anyway by the time ball thought to copyright the design in the 70s his happy face that reproducibly 50 million times making it part of the public domain Lou Franius tended to create a lace smiley after the 60 student riots in Paris as well as designate positive news stories as trademarked a symbol at least 80 countries that goes on Walmart said it had no choice but to oppose the front in secret register missed this smiley for which use Lou Franius turned foul

senator is part of a failed democratic party establishment led by arous been that enable the George W. Bush presidency and republican majorities and all the havoc they have worked at home and abroad course it's still early at this point in the last presidential cycle the first hints of how we're dean

july women in john kary and representative dick give heart these three were supposed to contend the early pulls gave them especially july women the inside track to the nomination and immediately the rest of the field no more than usual dismissive cover it i'm not going to read the whole thing but basically what it says is that per position on the war has been uh you know unacceptable she's been a shield she's been forward she's been supporting it in person Clinton is one of the warmest politicians ever for many says but it advises of stripped what personality she has hiding it from the public what remains is a heartless passionless machine surrounded by the very people around the activist based in the 1990s and it continued to hold a party's grassroots in other contempt the operation is

constant and half the army's fighting force and dramatically reduced could be largely phased out of major combat responsibilities next year as military officials debate their performance of what role they should play in future conflicts the rack was an important test whether the army could use the guard more aggressively and that's as his last resort during the cold war the guard was recast is these strategic reserve it will be used in the big fight against the Soviet Union the big fight that of course never came so they're getting the national guard out of a rack chasing you're on q a m

Rogers this is know that the lord even loves the electric It's a 1247-13-01-AQA. Ganon comes out, audio like that. Oh my God. But he did our his porn website that we all already knew about, or somewhere else. And a form in Philadelphia last week last Wednesday, he's a matter of fact, a conservative White House correspondent who do national attention for his past life as a gay, because a gay escort declared himself gay, gay publicly for the first time, I did always as puzzled. And finally answered questions about discrepancies in the logs of his trips to the White House. Jeff Ganon came out, followed a question from blogger activist Michael Rogers, who publish his page one Q, and maintains the blog, blog active, which reports on anti-gay politicians who are themselves gay. Oh no. I wonder what your buddies' position is on gay rights, and on gay marriage and all these other things. From, from position, he's prone to be that position. You're an ex-coverner. Oh that, that's already priced. Do Ferry. Hey Charlie. I kick you ass. Ganon emerged on the Washington State after a liberal blood reveal that he had worked as a gay escort prior to his installment at the White House. America blog, run by DC based John Eravosis, discovered revealing photographs of Ganon who build himself as an X-US Marine Corps Joc. In a conversation with Ross Storich, there's the evening Ganon spoke frankly about numerous questions. This side is raised about his work. Ross Storich was the first place where they published the secret service logs of the business for the White House. We're reading that Ganon checked out and checked it on numerous occasions that failed to check out. Oh, can I like to wrote some more tell? They checked him, but they never checked out. That's the problem with secret service record keeping Ganon. In seven-answer why secret service log show 14 days he failed to check out. He referenced an article from 2003, which revealed Shadi record keeping by the presidential. I think you're going to see that in this abormol thing that's coming out right now he added, you're probably not going to get a complete historical record. As to be able to stop the over to White House Ganon said, never. Absolutely, never stayed over to White House, never ever. My personal life has nothing to do with how I got to the White House as a reporter. My personal life had nothing to do with anyone in the White House or in the Bush administration. In other words, he wasn't doing anybody in there. I don't believe it. Maybe he's doing our Eiffelizer. I'm suspecting, Rove. He's a Rove and maniac. He's tingling like to mingle. At the panel in Tallahaphe was the Ganon phase questioning from Rogers. Eiffelizer and Gay Activist who has been critical, they can serve as track record at the White House. When Rogers last met Ganon at National Press Club discussion, he shouted a question from the back of the room. Did Ganon ever have sex with anybody in the White House? Subsequently, he was a square of the building and Ganon refused to answer. He was escorted on an interesting plan worth. Rogers is more successful in the Tallahaphe appearance once. The question if he was gay, Ganon said he was a member of this community. Rogers went farther. Are you a gay man? Ganon responded absolutely. Absolutely. Fso F. and Lutley. Yet perhaps the most stunning of Ganon's comments was as a search that he supports outing Gays, who live one life and vote another. Ganon who himself was outed as a former sex worker without his consent. Said that he supported the outing of the first while Virginia congressman, Ed Schrock, Republican of Virginia, who resigning the disgrace after Rogers posted tapes of him, and said he was gay sex on the internet. How do you like that? For a pervert. I look at the case of the congressman from Virginia. I'm not entirely clear of all the elements of that case, but it seems like he was voting one way in Congress. Living another way in his personal life again and told Rogers to write Thursday. That I think is a contradiction that probably should have been looked at. I wonder what Miss Mark Foley thinks about that. It's the same thing with these people that run around and talk about drinking his van. We're going to change the drinking age. Or we're going to restrict smoking. And then again, they do those same things like, I'm going to set the rule and say that doesn't apply to me. In other words, don't do as I do, do as I say, is what he's trying to think. Do as I gay. But he's said the outing of Senator Rick Sand Tourms communication director, Cross the line. Rogers outed Bob Trinham, Santorne spokesman earlier this year. What was done to Bob Trinham? I think was despicable again or Mark. That was just a Schmerer campaign in 10-Hurt Rick Sand Tour. Then every Saturday this was. How many Republicans are going to hire people they know or think are gay? And what gay people are going to go to work for Republicans because the fear of being outed? It's identity politics. He sent him against that kind of thing because it's been used to destroy people's careers. Rogers said, Friday's glad to hear that he and Ganon shares some common ground. I'm a firm believer in open dialogue. He said, and hearing that the risk common ground between Jeff and I, It should be between Jeff and me, it's certainly a step in the right direction for our community. Ganon also addressed accusations of plagiarism. I don't know about that. Nobody cares about that. That's gone. I'm going to do with sex. Right. And you're right. Now I need to do with sex. What who now gives a craft? So there we go. Jeff Ganon, Dr. He's gay. You're fair right. As if there was ever any doubt. We got a thousand thirteen votes. What did I tell you, man? Piece of cake. Piece of cake. Gah. Here's a diabetic standing there in the kitchen eating cake offering somebody was X-Wife and Godfather 3. Too much sugar in him will be man. Look at what those can always do to poor Eli Wallach. I thought we could reason together. And he's in that thing with his hands like, oh my God. Oh. Good morning. Only you. I'm actually the Italian definitely. Would I take his ass? You told me he's still alive, you know, I wallach? Yeah, thanks. Oh my God. And that's sad. He should only rot. Just for that movie. And then you told me you started thinking about other movies. And we realized how bad he is. I watched the good the bad in the ugly, which he's he's the ugly. He was the bad boy. Yeah, bad in the ugly. Right. And I just realized, hey, he can't act in anything. Really. Eli wallach. I thought we could reason together. Michael. What would it shame? Truly. Excellent movie. If it only. Right. Can bad casting. Great. Great. Too many hits to get it. Josh liked it a lot. I liked it a lot. I watched it several times. It's like a hard work Andy Garcia says. Joey. Zazan. Yeah, I liked that. That part's good. On the horse. He just horseen around. Maybe they should fear you. She's good though. Oh, yeah. You sure. But still. That's horrible. It was awesome. Here I go. Go. Right. Like it's a comedy thing. You know. Just got through all these murders again. Everything in all. Yeah. Michael. Probably will fear you. It turns around. Like they're coming. Hey, maybe they should fear you. And then the scene where he's laying out there on the Veranda, whatever. And Connie is like holding his hand and she's saying, oh, afraid. I think it was an accident. Yeah. He's like she's trying to convince him that he didn't have his brother killed. I was going to make him feel better. Padma on the head. You know, no, no, you'll feel better. Take two in call me in a morning. 2014 votes boy, oh boy. If we want to have that many people listening, you know, we'd be dangerous. You're going to be amazed at this. I don't know if I got. I'm thinking I've time to do this. They'll do it little tease around your home. There are countless gadgets whose electrical fields scientists now warn. Our link to the pression, Miss carriage and cancer. Oh, my God. I'm depressed. You know, wait to do this story. You're going to go home and unplug everything. It's going to be George unplugged. Kampo camp or Kimbo coming along or two. See, it says on their bow. I don't want to come bow. It sounds like little boat peepe. Some of I never think of Kimbo camp or a little boat peepe. I'll take it one thing boy over there. University of Dodge where they got that big mook. How in front they just love us. Man, we're always getting faxes from there. Inside information and gossip and all kinds of swirl. Maybe we're blasting down there. They got us blasting on the speakers.

Invisible smart created by the electricity that powers our civilisation is giving children cancer, causing miscarriages and suicides and making some people allergic to modern life, new scientific evidence reveals. The evidence which is being taken seriously by an actual and international bodies in authority suggests that almost everyone is being exposed to a new form of pollution with countless sources in daily use in every home. Too official to see maybe the homeless again egg on us here. See that? Too official to farm and health reports on the smog or R to be presented to ministers next month in England and the health protection agency is recently held the first meeting of an expert group charged with developing advice to the public on the threat. The UN's worth of our world, our health organization calls the electronic smog one of the most common and fastest growing environmental influences and stresses that it takes seriously concerns about the health effects. It adds that every one of the world is exposed to it and that levels will continue to increase as technology advances. Wireing creates electrical fields, one component of the smog, even when nothing is turned on. And all electrical equipment from TVs to toast is give off another one Magnetic fields. The fields rapidly decrease with distance, but apply such as hair appliances such as hair drires and lifershivers, used close to the head, hanging of highest boars. Electric blankets and clock radios near to beds produce even higher doses because people are exposed to them for many hours while sleeping. Radio frequency fields yet another component are emitted by microwave ovens, TV and radio transmitters, mobile phone nests and phones themselves also used close to the haid. The WATOS is that the smog could interfere with the tiny, natural electrical currents to help to drive the human body. Nurs we've a signal by transmitting electric impulses, for example, while the use of electric cardiac ram tests to find the electrical activity of the heart. Campingers have long been worried about their exposure to fields from lines carried by electric pyros, but until recently, their concerns were dismissed even ridiculed by the authorities. But last year, study by the official National Radiological Protection Board concluded that children living close to the lines are more likely to be at a loop keemium. And ministers are considering whether to stop any more homes being built near them. The discoveries causing a large scale, reappraisal of having at the hazards of smog. The international agency for research on cancer, part of the WATOS leading international organization of the disease, classes this smog is a possible human-carcinogen. And for pressurid David Carpenter, Dean of the School of Public Health at the State University of New York, told the independent on Sunday last week that it was likely to cause up to 30% of all childhood cancers. A report by the California Health Department concludes it's also likely to cause adult leukemia, rain cancers, possibly breast cancer, and could be responsible for a tenth of all miscarriages. I like that. Perhaps, strangers to others increasing evidence that the smog causes some people to become allergic to electricity leading to nausea, pain, dizziness, depression, difficulties in sleeping and concentrating when the electrical appliances are going near mobile phone and the system is going to be a problem. Some are so badly affected that they have to change their lifestyle. I like that. Well, I can't sit too close to the equipment. I'll see ya. Oh, but I can't, I say I'm in the middle of the surrounded by the strut. Right. We all are electrical fields. And you say the homeless, but you know, there's the waves are coming from everywhere up the streetlights, off the power lines, right? The ones that make our signals sound. Like that. What ever happened at this AC radio craft that we're supposed to be supposed to be at the end of the night. It's just two to one's the one they have in engineering. It's lovely. They got one.

Ultra sound band advances on cruise who fly. The California Assembly is voted to restrict the use of ultra sound machines for personal use and proving a bill that would allow them to be sold only to license professionals. Democratic Assemblyman Ted Lou introduced the bill after Mission Impossible 3 star Tom Cruise. But an ultra sound machine that's images of a soundboard and child. Doctors and technologists typically receive years of training for ultra sound games which helps obstetrician check of baby's health. Cruise was criticized by doctors who said improperly using devices can harm a fetus. Ready for that? He's a crazy person. Tom Cruise. Yeah. Crazy person. I'm right to the science house.

And the other ones are the same seven or eight. That's it. That's all we've got in your work for. What? Well, I mean, it's been others. But you know. When it's more recent, it's just fresh in your mind. Maybe these people have all been affected by electromagnetic.

There are any kids playing hooky today. The religious people are all crazy people. And the more religious they are, the more crazy they are. And the crazy they are, the more dangerous they are.

How come you guys never do any van stops in North, the forward or stop on each count? We're not doing van stops. We don't do that anymore. We just gave up. We're just because it's pointless. If we're not getting any raise in much money in the areas where we're supposed to have an audience, why the whole we're going to like Tom Beach County. Well, why wouldn't you go in there?

I didn't change since he'd like to help us out. But he doesn't understand. We don't want it. Don't you understand. We don't want it. There's no point. There is no upside. There's just nothing there, you know. And the fact that we got that one facts last week from those people. You know, that's supposed to, I guess that's supposed to make me feel like we're obligated to do this. We're just not going to do it no more. We stopped doing it for a period of time. And for the very reason that we don't want to be doing it now. It's a pain in the grass man. It's a waste of time. People don't want to turn loose with a few bucks. And they don't want to eat part of it. And then they go and rip off the CDs and burn copies. And steal them into all kinds of crap. Well, what's the point? You know, and then we had those nitty-key chains. And I had one over big and then of course the other one. Yeah, that's, uh, nobody want anything to do with him.
