You I mean, why would anybody go driving so deep in a hiding? Look at that friend request, we may be getting to our 900 before you know it And I'm going to play all bits today, let's see who's this group of Jim Let me take, you know what I do on these?

My buddy, and I thought my imaginary friend Mike You know, it's fun, it can be fun I don't mind, I mean, you know, this is the one thing I will say is that Over the years we never gave an email address because I don't want to be inundated And I don't know, answer emails for 80's and in people out there But so far we haven't been like inundated with messages And that's why I'm taking the time to like just a quick note back to whoever might be Right, you know, you get a little picture, you know, you get a little profile That's it, of course, I don't know if that's the real picture if they look like Robert Greeper and Gilbert, but nevertheless Of course, some people may be more than one message, but that's another story Okay, so here's our poll today, see you interrupted me So in other words, you think that I'm foolish, well forget about that, you think I'm foolish period and with good reason But what's your, what would you say the odds are that ever happening other any circumstances? Give, you know, given the circumstances of how this whole happened, I'd say they're not very good Yeah, I don't know, I don't mean like right now, now that all the hysteria is still I mean when all the smoke clears right We'll see, only time will tell I see, okay, and that's that's a good safe bed What do you don't gamble good thing you don't gamble away your money, man, and I'll be oh that's so I started to say My kid FSU who's a 20 year old guy after he's told me that the slots are I have crap See, listen, all you people and food in my friend Harry and Detroit, you do with your money whatever you want to do with it Okay, one thing about me, I don't tell people how to lift their lives That's not part of my DNA's philosophy, in other words, as long as you don't hurt anybody, just have a good time Enjoy life, whatever whatever it does it for you And I enjoy going and you know, and every now and then I get lucky and this business about all the probabilities See, I found out an interesting thing That time I still want to get a PO and I called that guy from the gaming commission whatever it is I remember and I had that long conversation, I was pretty, uh, PO about it And he's playing to me that that those percentages that's over the life of the program of the machine mine So if it says it pays on 97% or 90% that's over like could be year and a half So that might mean the machine like you'd hotter and hell for a couple of days and it might be colder for two, three weeks from month cold as ice But anyway, in addition to his three best friends should who should kneel and do his will Well, probably I'll put nobody on there, don't you think yes for the sun fair to my reading Close good the personal friends who are like you know great friends Uh, nobody is good to it anyway so far George is kicking ass By 24 and of course that's right.

So he writes it's been a long time coming but this week I finally received the Christmas gift that we're waiting for for what seems like ages. I left behind eternal forces video game. This is the first Christmas gift I've ever bought for myself. Normally I hate Christmas in fact I may get a point of nature to search out and print out all the news stories from around the world involving thefts from and desecrations of nativity scenes. But I'm finished. I've passed to my office area with all the photos of the glum-year-old tighter standing around the now headless Joseph Sinneries and I make this news mirror on my private sanctuary. The place I want to win the holidays and especially the holiday commercials get to me too much to take. And he goes on about the blind Jesus with his eyes poked out and in Montreal. The activity scene where he was boosted the baby Jesus and they never recovered the body and they had an anchor Jesus to his cradle this year. And this past weekend, bandits thought off legs of several of the wisemen at the knees now they're still wise but about 30% of the person said shorter. Lies of a shorter and some of the huge property West figures also had their eyes poked out. And he goes on a, and this is a new violent video game but it's so religious. That is too funny. Can you play as the anti-Christ army? You know you've been watching. You're not doing really well. I would get it if you better hope that I stick around long enough to reconsider all this to re-evaluate. I hope especially when you told me that that was an unrealistic goal. You know, maybe old Joe, you know, maybe Jake is actually neighbor. We'll get to him and say, you know why? Why not show a little bit of something, you know? Yeah. Well, some of the old men in the nice, nice, no, we're a hateful note. Something just to come around and pacify him and just, you know, as a closing chapter and every other we have to show that you did. But we'll see and maybe not. Because the one thing about the mice face thing and maybe I'm wrong about this is I get the feeling that, Well, I mean, you know, let's face it. Oh, and I didn't mention we got 89. There was another one during the break. Oh, really? Yeah, cute. What the heck was her name? Let's see. Let's see who it was. Cute, uh, chicken, a pepper pines. I think for what her name was.

I bet you never dreamed I could do this. If I would have f**ked, I can't stand people who would have said, who to f**ked? I hate that. What if most of the knowing of Christians? Crazy people say that. Who to f**ked? Nine hundred and one. If I were to push this about a month or two ago, we could have a thousand by the end of the year. I mean, I could have a thousand. Right.

Let's just give it a shot. You know, maybe it's something that somebody wants to hear, but I doubt it. And it wasn't. But nevertheless. Eight Marines were charged yesterday to killings at 24. Racky civilians last year, during a bloody door to door sweep in the town of Haditha. That came after one of their comrades was killed by Rootside Bomb. They were pissed off and fired up so they decided, kill some people and they did. In the biggest US criminal case involving civilian deaths to come out of the Iraq War so far for the Marines, all enlisted men, were charged with unpeamed and hated murder. The other four were officers who were not there during the killings, but were accused of figures investigating and reporting to this. The most serious charges were brought against that Sergeant Frank Woodreck, a 26 year old squad leader accused of murdering 12 civilians in order to murder his six more and set a house third by his squad. He was accused of telling his men, shoot first, ask questions later. That's not good to have you in morbid here on the Christmas weekend, right? Keep it right, real, keep it right. Okay, whatever you say, keep it right. Remember that guy, that guy is long since dead. Here it is. March 101 will be 31 years of it on the air, and I don't know if it's still around by then. And I just stop and think back to a lot of the really nasty, hateful people over the years. I'm not sure if it's still around by then. And I just stop and think back to a lot of the really nasty, hateful people over the years. I mean, I've been a lot of nice people too, but the ones that stand out in your mind are like, the hateful ones. Of course, the ones that wish that you would croak, that wish you all, you would fail and hate you like poison, because for whatever reason, you know, because they just probably hate everybody. And the interesting part of it is that most of those people are pushing up daisy now. KAT, very early on. I just started my show on this old, old, cog, of course, all of our listeners were, you know, death plus 100. That was our median demographic. And he calls up one day, isn't it? KAT, right, they all keep it right. I'm not sure he's lost that little. Yeah, just like that, real ancient. KAT, right. And of course, he was one of only 80's in and people over the years who've given me instructions of how to do the show, what to talk about, how to talk about it, and all of these, all of these things. And I joined a parents on Good Morning, a mayor for yesterday, former president Bush 41, joked to actor George Clooney about Britney Spears underwear problem. Oh my God. Bush, you're also said he was embarrassed about crying during his speech about his son, the geeter, fat as Jeff. And dismissed, first lady Laura Bush's skin cancer skiers only a little thing on her leg. KAT, got a great line for that. Wow. How did he QA in? Hello. How are you? How are you? How are you? Yeah. And I should leave Alice in my will. Yeah, I'll just rent her. Like we story. Or maybe he was just in for self-hating queens that pull her take a next week. Alice, how are you? Come on, QA, I'm hello. Okay. Now actually, that's the best of the three so far right there. No doubt about it. This one might be a real call of what I doubted. I made it. Wow. Whoa. Man. And if you had this, so W is not W, the George Herbert walked. They're all the same to me. All of them are thieves and dumbos and crooks, dangerous, dangerous. The dangerous Bush clan. And as far as all this Trump and Rosie stuff, I don't, you know, as they say in Norway, Hubsan Dred, you know, I don't care about either one of them. I can't stand either one of those people. He is right. I will say that. She's a pigface, you know. They said something like that. And he says, I'm worth billions dollars. I have to listen to this fat slob and he, if she walks in from being a moral authority, because of all those hankies, fanky and all his wife and after wives and extra kids, all those other crappies have been doing. And of course, the bad here, the comb over she called it. That purple wig man, it left me in a purple haze. I'm telling Jimmy Hendrix is well over his grave right now. See, again, it's worth billions of dollars with, you know, when you think that he goes, he took out the area, you know, something sensible. When you got that kind of money, he's like, I would put him in a category with mal. Oh, don't, don't, don't. He's a bad piece. Wow. First he had that orange that kind of cartoon character, orange color one. And now he's got the purple one. 1963 and a pool and yours still stuck on 19 and Jacob just moved up and off. He's up to three. So I guess we can assume he's voted now. The biggest name, so best challenge to the faces. We'll rock your sports video, 50. You'll find 60. You'll be there. New York. Yeah. I've got a good of direct administration. Join the investigation of the E.C.O.I. outbreak at Taco Bell. No, it was on the E.C.O.I. outbreak. The majority of victims ate at Taco Bell. Well, I drove down to get a big bull. I've been the reason. I've talked about what's calling now to me. Don't felt like I was shot with a toy for me. Don't. And then I got explosive number three. Oh, they're my thru-off. I love them all with all trees. And my thru-off. If I dream to my knees. I was a knee. Playing beside my toy. And my thru-off. I've got a good ball to go over. Oh, glad I'm so sick. You're not as sick as I am. My stick of the view. And why's the ball again? You may be down. Or look at me. You can see stuff. I was 12 pounds in three hours. Oh, that's bad. You know what, you can see my spawning. Oh, that's a lot of it's point. You go home. No, watch out. I get the maximum part. No, don't make me get out of the way. I'm so tired. You don't make me deserve my new show. I'm so proud. Three, four, one, go. I'm the cramps where all the world is. But my proud, my am so rich. I was weak. With case of the ugly girl. And on my tongue, my started growing. A long, long time ago. Oh, he was 1900. And Jesse Hems was just a lad of nine. And no one knew what was in store. Just ended the Spanish American War. So they party like it was 1890 nine. The war events that made you shiver. But there were times we did deliver. A promise that was kept. With that famous one small step. I can't remember each event. Or everything that man did invent. A century we will present. This is how it went. My, my how the time it did fly. Since it started some deported many tears we did cry. For the century it's done that we say goodbye. It all happened in the blink of an eye. A hundred years have gone by. It all started when two guys were right. When they put in their blade into light. And the star of Brady, yo. Signed for it had his mother's name. And want to theory and max blank. And the Titanic, that story. We all know. Well, World War One, it soon began with shooting off. Two Francis Bird and then. Million side from the blue. And where's the kid was friend to? And then brought Shahaddish feather Lucien. Panama, connect it both of the oceans. And now for these we won't see again. A hundred years gone by. And we were singing in my eye. Have the time it did fly. Since it started some deported many tears we did cry. For the century it's done that we say goodbye. It all happened in the blink of an eye. A hundred years have gone by. And now for that his family to the team. They've mass produced a new model team. And the bird landed in Paris. Then some old deep red dead panda sail in Wall Street. And the great deep fashion that women would vote like you and me. And Germany's chancellor was sworn in. And World War Two it soon began. Major were sovereign land. The project minutes and the pollution trial in Tennessee. We caught a first look at TV. Then the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. And the day that lives in him for me. But I'm starting with the TV ins Jen. But I'm what in the hauwling call? In Russia no one did the cross. And Germany they find the loss. Discovered the horrors of the Holocropolis? Oh. That man little boy ignored the gate. She's our world on that very day. day. Me though had just begun. And trying to move by, not sing, turn. The first player in baseball that was black. Is we held up there, homeland back. Massachusetts, like the Jack, your home. Tridious, gone by. And we were singing in my mind. I have a time to defy since it started something for it. Many tears would defy. For the sense you'll read, it's time that we say goodbye and all happened in the blink of an eye. On hundred years have gone by. Separate, but eat, or make such a fuss. Of course, it's too tight when on the bus. Only your cured with the vaccine. Then my shots get us big time with spotting Nick. Our troops into the re-aquette discovered. The double, he looks skinny. Oh, jam, can't let us wait too soon. But promise to get us all to the moon. You're the first and space. Can't the pill we've did it race. And the ranchers have been climbed into the night. Cuba's missile gave us quite a fright. But selfish nature is on new fight. A hundred years gone by. And we were singing in my mind. I have a used-ed advice. Since it started something for the man he cheesey to cry. For the sense you'll read, it's time that we say goodbye and all happened in the blink of an eye. A hundred years have gone by. Neils giant step was the big news. Rovers sway gave women right to choose. Nixon resigns about water gates. All right. Got the troops out of Vietnam. Had hostage taken by Iran. And a virus made us too scared to go deet. Access to babies held the loft. Some guy named Bill started Microsoft. Chernobyl explosion. The Berlin Wall gets broken. The US is our sad goodbye. Some students in China, they detry. Seven died in the Florida sky. A hundred years gone by. What do they do? They do. They do. They do. Wow. I think I could play that three more times. I do like that. I don't have time to play it. How long was that? But I was just how long is it? I think it's a little personal. Eight nineteen even it's nineteen. Wow. It's one of those like MacArthur Park, like one, you know, when you got to go take a choice. You put that on. Nine, nine, eight and a pull. It would be really great. Nine, nine, nine, eight and a one more photo a thousand. Wow. Totally moly. I got an update on the downtracking a more lengthy story. Druck and drive in for down trail. Let's see. They saw him disembark a 2007 black suit or Bentley on the 1200 black Washington Avenue. He left the vehicle double parked and you were in it on the street before getting back behind the wheel. I had it take a little look and a leak. That's right. They said he was only able to produce vehicle registration when asked for his driving documents and then we forced it in order to hear appeared confused and disoriented and had bloodshot water where I slurred speech and a strong odor of booms, baby booze. He failed. This is how field sobriety test later refused to breath test. Ultimately, he rested and transported a date kind of jail where he's being $100,000 by. Marlon said no comment. But a beep by the boot put above. Two months ago, the human is wife, Natalie, the tag we onel purchased a $2.65 million water for residents and run by the beep by the way speaking of how he beats his a phony anonymous person. See, I don't put anonymous friends on there on our my space page. Do you think it's a good idea? Well, that'll get you $1,000 quicker. $1,000 was. $1,000 friends. I don't want anonymous. I won't put them on. I won't put miners on there with a one exception. He's getting close to a legal age. I'm not a bad guy. $1,000 votes on the pool. All right. And Jacob got four, which means he must be voting a lot. He's tapping it up. And $9,000 on our friends. No, you think I should put anonymous people on there on a my space? No. Get out of town Jose, man. Get cereal. The one that's coming along my accent went to the former S.U.M. So I'm going to check for a treat on my residence. Not the fact that she knew idiot. I'm seeding like a wise Christian. I'll pat the Jews and give home home. I'd love to very close rise to the very... You fair who don't know the Bible like I know. I'm seeding like a wise Christian. And how we almost think and act alike and act their faith whenever it's appropriate. The old women, they want their clothes. Everybody in the world was wise and Christian. And look at the same and said the same things. Boring, I don't think so. No. To me, that would be paradise and the Republican way. I'm seeding like a wise Christian. And how we almost think and act alike and act their faith. All the games black and give long must die. All the joy to everybody's Christian. And what? Oh, hold it right there, Mr. There's better crime. That's right. We're like Christmas bullies. And all, only dating, actually, but give a time. Haven't tried to change the subject, Bustin. There's been a series of breaking and entering. We want to find out what you know about it. Well, was the night before Christmas? No, through the town. Now that creature was stirring. Some bearded fat clown. Senaclaws? Also known as Nick the Saints? Also known as Chris the Kringle. Well, rather than. Sounds like some canis on that hippie. And I'll bet you, or one of us help or something. Okay, Joe, cup him. All right, you've got the right to have a Merry Christmas. And you've got the right to have a Merry Christmas. Have you stand and earn this until a pair of lips? Cam and will be held against you. What you've just heard is true. If you shouldn't count that anyone with visions of sugar plums dancing in their heads, report them immediately to the Christmas police. Let it away in at 5.6. You'd be a QM and by the way, Fat Boy or PD Lenny or whichever former QM sales hole is anonymous. They're on a mice base. So they're whipped up about the fact that the facts, the one that's sitting in there with you, that no, the facts isn't working which it hasn't for three days. Right? Right. As if we didn't know that? Well, I'm not getting anything either. No, because it doesn't work. It's messed up. Or maybe you want to reboot it, reset it, or maybe the line is dead. I already know. I mean, you did what? You rebooted it, rebooted it, and it's dead. Because mine here is working just fine. Like as usual, it's just stuff there that's all screwed up. Anyway, this particular person must be somebody who's, it's got to be. Because they also have the number here, because they were the ones that were trying to facts me something here. I'm a regular phone, which is not connected to a facts. I mean, you know who it is. You know who it is. Fat boy. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you really hear from me, you fat boy, okay? Go away, or it could be PD-Lenny, you never know. Or it could be a, some other, Schmindrich. Anyway, there's a thousand and twenty-one votes on a poll. Not to be a 920, friends and mice base. Wow. And that impressive? I'll say. Yeah, you will say, because you're not going anywhere on our poll. You have it. You haven't moved since I sat out this morning. You haven't moved one vote. Oh man.

I mean, I went through this couple of weeks with somebody. I actually know exist playing with my mind. Now, I've got somebody I don't even know is for real. I mean, the pictures of a real person, you know, but that is me and it. And that's playing a little with my mind. Although not much. Not the same category. You know, it's just a fun, right? Right. Just for fun. Anyway, whoever it is, I'd sure. I'd sure like to fight out. Anyway, Boca Brands got 71. Brady Quinn 37. He doesn't need my money or your money, anybody else's. And in spite of what Josh says, that's why they're not getting a lot of votes for you because you're so Negatory. I'm not, Negatory. Negative. Brady Quinn's not going to make it in the NFL.

What do I tell you about a big comeback this time of year? You know, you go through a living hell and then all of a sudden come back, bounce right back. Guess the only thing to do would be to take that one call right there. Why did you just say that? I don't know. Okay, WQIM, hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, man. I did want to say which we have a new year, and if you're playing this today, I was wondering if there's any way you would say Eisen. No problem. Thanks a lot, Neil. Have a happy. You too, Neil. See you, bye-bye. See you, that was good to think, and I told you I should take that call tonight. 147 votes on the full English New York Street Best Friends, who should Neil even as Andrew is Will, who wants that money? What a bunch of money, grab resume. God, by any way, that's human nature. Somebody wanted to leave a whole bunch of money, even if they didn't know me, and I said, how about me? And they said, oh sure, I'd say, okay. George, 379. A lot of people out there, and that's because these people are connected to the radio. So they think that George and I hang together, and we go out and have dinner and whatever. Like, you know, is that what people think? Yeah. I don't know what they said. And he's always said that over the years, people think that we hang out. Listen, one of the funniest things my dad ever said to me was, hey, when Neil comes down, what do you guys like, meet it a restaurant, and you know, go over the show prep and stuff like that, and I laughed so hard that I was holding my side and, oh, right. I mean, I thought it would mine scene you guys. You know what I think it's just more fun this way that you know, you'll never see me again. Kind of strange. Right. And we George 379, me, 326, meaning me, me, me, me, me, me, me, whoever the amount of grabbers are out there, or leave me some, give me a little something something Neil, and of course I'm flicking.

Book of Brian 72, Brady Quinn 37 doesn't need my money, anybody else's. He's going to make million. Now you will admit that. Oh, yeah. Okay. And because of the fact that you're so accommodating in my buddy Brady Quinn, you got another vote. You got 20 now. That impressive? Not really. Nobody's got 18 and Jacob was going into deep hiding. I think he's the one is for protection program. I have to ask his attorney, Jerry, about that. Jacob's got five out of a thousand 47 votes. So anyway, that's where we stand on the day before. Well, it's not really the day before, but it's Christmas weekend, right? It's all starting a couple of days ago and I'll kind of like lumps in together. So when you fly over the Florida coast, you're flying south from here, for example. And when you get to the point, I don't really want to start to let me be viral beach or four pierce. And from that point on, it's just like one big strip of connected bedroom town. Yeah. Connected geographically, but unconnected in any other way. Just one big long strip of mong. The big fuck 12 Friday you best. The federal government just wanted to grab those people to play. And you're withering criticism of most parties, Brown, offering no apology. And mostly great others, withered about them, because hundreds of ones. My Brown, there's no one left to play my said brownie. Your little couple, mid-shay my said brownie. The short careers up in flames, there's no one. I know who's or whose favorite bush. We'd better make them shut up before he says. If we shoot a mess up, you can defend him. But I'm sure you won't find many things that he should do time. I was just tired of his sport. He's way too dumb to run the FPMA. So people died when he ran FPMA. Now that everyone knows that you're leadership old, you can go back to your horos shows. Today, for public and jam democrats criticize the fact that Brown is still on the federal payroll. That maybe because as long as he remains at administration official, his testimony must be cleared by the White House. He everybody half browned Brown. A countable for everybody Brown that threw out as a human being. I'm a biggest opponent that thought I got around nose. And I know's where to find it. There was no rush to get them saved. They don't worry public in any way. I did everything I possibly can. The show must have called for the club's plan. Oh, what a job I had as a vector of fever. When I'm a choice, then the weaver and the clueless of the fish. His his kids round nose and the fish. His kids give round nose and the fish. New Orleans is wiped out in gold. With double use and I did one heck of a job. And it took days off to be a crown in another white-based, Christian Fowning the national guard is down then down. With all of us just to get the press out a town. Everybody go home. There's nothing to see. Everything here is Beijing over Hurricane gave us a baby seat for the opon social and to the area like the giant republic in Swingy. Who's Jesus for our Lord and King? Praise Jesus for our Lord and King. I don't worry, you can't imagine what we'll lack. It serves the right to have less blacks and you descend to Susei. It's a national disgrace that you'd never lack in the first place. This is no time to blame the blame game. Since we don't let the regains are called by Gagians. Who are not the right kind of homo? Fight scottie with land and carol, go where a chiming may America right wing dream. To big everybody, white-life bees. And an ignorant son of a big, rich, who gets his jobs. Brown, hoosen, who rich, poor, how I miss bedding by you. Baby and horses, I'd rather do that than watch floating horses on the negligent bird of her now. And I'll keep going down to keep my nose brown. I'll protect the jiff bird of her now. But I'll keep going down to keep my nose brown. For a signal in the city of New Orleans. Yes, some of the people down there say he failed. Stuffed the people in the astrid dome like cattle. While half the national guard was in Iraq. He cut funding for their levies. Looters called Zing and Arquise. In a group of we made a bigger deal. Inserts were never leave all away. One white group we trained away. A meal in the ast, for help from the needy seals. George Bush was the case to name him Crawford. I guess next year, though, be no more needy ground. Girls gone wild needs to see all new Orleans. Or to have to send their film to the Florida. Talk about your death-long presidents. Whoa, you ain't kidding. Good bye, George. You gotta go, me, oh my old. You gotta go home, push right up and on the bio. But you sure flew quick when it came to sick. Terry Shawlo. Some of our Bush's are putting your toothbrush now saved the bio. I judge it while people drown. You played around the relaxing golf world. He was all bank-ish, RIO, and Teas, and not your couple. Key that's half a dendou. Oops, and no one can't do even prepare for the worst scenario. You were the one busy half-in-furn in the ast and no no. He'll investigate and a major gate that's real bullshit. Zoning is such a way to warns that Dutch you can't lock-up, so it don't continue. But no one will get blamed like with Agent Plain, No Hedge will roll. A car famed as for this and the assnap on the wrist and no charges file. What a surprise. Because you're a liar, no one gets fired with each new mess. Nobody. A new death toll, a swift pin to pull. That's no problem, no fix it. Your spin, the she will deal with new world-leans. Because that's their job, and for usual. Son of a bush, she has a foot in your touch, your own and home.

Hello, I'm Timmy Dean. You know, if someone had told me a 25 years ago that I'd been making Babel's, I'd have said, huh? That's due food, isn't it? But times have changed, and I guess I've got to change with them. But I don't have to like it. You people want your Babel's, I'll give you your Babel's. With a big ol' Greece's slab, a Timmy Dean Fort Sausage on it. New Timmy Dean, non-co-share Babel San Francisco. If you're Jewish, you can buy him. You just can't eat him. Still, you can't just eat his�ators, but he's all a tough thing. Time and new Timmy Dean Bigalf battled. There's a little bit of big it and everybody.
