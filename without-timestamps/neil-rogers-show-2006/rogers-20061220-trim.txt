The music stressed on the previous programs are those of the hosts, guests, and colleagues. J.P. Morgan, she was a real bullboy. I just mentioned that in passing. She's a part of the band. And the biggest name is the best talent in this is 4-3-5-60. You're Taylor, gay, gay, P.P. Morgan, gay, etc. Charles Nelson Ryan, gay. Paul and gay. All those, uh, mutual people. New York, y'all. I'm a good and drug administration. It's joy and investigation that you call out great at Taco Bell. No, it is on the E.C. or an outbreak. The majority of victims ate at Taco Bell. Well, I drove down to get a beam of reason. Taco Bell was calling out to me. So, if I could, it was shot with a tough needle. And then I got explosive number three. Then I threw a tire and the wind all trees. And my throw gave her a beam to my knees. I was playing inside my toy. And my toy was in over there. But I'm so sick of you and I'm sick of you. I must live in you and pause the ball. I keep it waving down. Oh, look at me. You get serious stuff. I've lost 12,000 free hours. Oh, that's bad. You know what, it's to make you can see my screen. Oh, and the rumble is flaky. Oh, God. So watch out, I can develop some personal. Oh, don't make me get out of the way. I'm so sick of you and make you piece of my intuition. I'm so full. Three, one, Paul and gay. The ground's full of love. But I know I'm so free. I was weak with gay solidarity of me. And I can't find strong growing fun. Wow. What do I have to do these started? That's a good one. It is a good one. We got a lot of good ones. And of course, it's almost Christmas. It's a middle of Chinooka, baby. I love my space. Let me tell you right now. Wait, I feel like yesterday you were bashing it though. Well, that's because I didn't know what tell us what's going on. Now that I've got more information. All I would say is if you're going to go on my space, just be a little bit cautious. Okay, about to kind of people. Fight out who they are, what they're all about. Fight out the link to their webcam and take a look and see what they're doing. Why do you look at them? You know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. See if they got their clothes on whether they're like standing upside down on their, well, whatever. And then this side whether you want to get involved. Now I found out some very fascinating information last night. So I don't take any of that other business personal. There are some people who are running and hiding and hiding and running and running and hiding. And whatever, that's fine, you know. And their paranoid and discured crap. Listen, that's okay. So that's what it is. But then, I don't know whether I should really do this on the air because of my turn into a real nightmares for us having a zidin people expecting me to answer every day. Oh, you know. Oh, yeah. Okay, go with it and then you can answer it. I was at. I don't trust you to answer it. No, but I have discovered that there's some pretty interesting amount. I heard from Detroit was on the Regan last night. The stalker. He says, please don't call me to stalker. He's the stalker. You guys are email buddies now, huh? We're old pen pals now and he didn't even mention much of call it backgammon again. As email last night. And also, there are a whole bunch of interesting people on there. And I try to respond to the real several emails on there and I responded all of my belief just to quick note whatever except one. I responded to that length. And certainly not what you think. It was, I don't know what the relationship would be. I will keep saying that few with my cousins son who's 29, by the way. I just mentioned ages. Let's just go with that few. Sounds better. No, what would you call it? I think if you, my brother may have any kids. I'll say that. And not that he's. But he is. But it runs in a family. The son of my brother had a son. It would be an effu right. Isn't that the way we're, my sister had a sister and she had a son. I wouldn't be my effu. Right. But my cousin's son, well, what's the relation there? I don't know what it is. That would be a cousin son. Oh, so my cousin son, he's was on my, my space. And this is the show online in Upstate New York and loves the show. So there you go. Happy to know, good David. Good luck to you. Believe me, in this world, you'll need it. Same as far as the other situations can soon know. You notice, don't I sound like I'm back to normal again today? Sure. Thanks to my good friend Moichi out there who I've gave me some psychological counseling online for a couple of days later. And also the information I discovered last night, which now I understand, might even know, you know, people who are game players and one did learn out with other people's minds. It's a cool, horrible thing. But when you consider who you're dealing with, you know, it's like, that's what it goes. In addition to which, you know, now that I realized that I was obsessed with somebody who doesn't exist, did I say that on Friday? You weren't here, Josh. I was like, I was in love with a fictitious person. Well, you said that yesterday too. Well, it's true. I mean, you know, there is a person with that name, but it's not the person I'd conjured up in my mind. So I might as well turn into something really subrosive. Get certain people in the audience like all excited. Oh, I know it. I know it. I know it. He's a permanent. I know it. Yeah. I'm a pervert. That's correct. But I might as well turn into something that it wasn't, right? Although it's really a shame that I can't, that I'm blocked out there. And I can't see all those other pictures again, because I could say they're all going to show them. Like that, could I? Well, you could still see the squat, right? I haven't seen squatting on the rock. I can still see that one. But that big diamond is spinning around. I'm blocked out. Your block, baby. You can't then. That okay, I'll survive. Well, you got Harry as a friend now. I don't want to look at Harry, okay? As a matter of fact, if I want to look, and if we got a new gray quinticture on there, but pretty little bit down on the dump. Thanks forever, sent that in. This is my space thing. We got 871 friends on there, which I bet you even you're just shocked and amazed. I really am. I got to tell you. And it's growing exponentially, whatever the whole that means. There are more and more people living and breathing people out of the age of 100, finding our my space page and this show and listening on line and sending mail. So point I started to make before I interrupted me with that Jacob crap again, is that if people want a get a response, all they got to do is go on a my space page and shoot me off some email. And I'll respond or maybe not. Or whatever they want to do. Let's see, did you fast me this? Yes, I did. Oh, this is about the original supine. And I'm never going to the soup yet. Are you a girl? I got two cups in front of me right here. And what kind? I got a sea of scumbo. And I don't know what's the other one. I got a little chilly action too. Wow, I'm loaded up here. Starting at 11 30 this morning, they soup man, which is opening an haven't heard today. This is their grand opening 20475, this game, Boulevard of the Pramanod Chauves. The original supine features a get made at soups of Aldi again, who inspired the soup man, the soup Nazi episode on sample. And notice that the release doesn't say the soup Nazi, but that's OK. The strollers locations, the 20, this is a Todd and Hope Stroll or a Vaventure. The 20 second original supine opens since the franchise concept was launched last year and the first one in South Florida. Since 84 New Yorkers in tourists, the lack of way to line at the again, a soup kitchen, their national all kinds of whether just for tasted as much heralded lobster, their biscuit, jumbo lia. In 2004, we closed the shop for the launch of his international franchise. And here it is, starting this morning at 11 30, they'll be giving away free samples and t-shirts to the first 100 people who come in the grand opening officially is this Friday, the 22th. Is that also any case last day? I don't know. What do you think? Yes. Well, we would have heard something if they would have come up with some kind of a deal with him. So the fact that their silent means like, oh, bye bye, 80K is probably going across the street. Wish you all the best that you came. We were good guy. Never stole a freight train. Good man. And do I want to read this over this? Well, I'll say that for a little bit later, and how's the soup are you? And this was also a char-hot once. You know, it's Chris is insane. I think probably because he's about right to fall off the chair from all the food. He shovel and burgers and soup at once. Yeah. Yeah. He shoveling it down. Maybe they're. And you know what I'm thinking is that if I'm in hiding from the world, you know, because, you know, if I'm just one of those people, it's a game player. Being out there on a border in the middle of red rock can you, man? It's a good taste to hide. But I just wouldn't plan on leaving there. You know what I mean? Let it go, man. I'd pack a lunch. Yeah. No, I just think it's funny that finally, so some payback can really be a bitch. It's an old, tricycle, shea. But when people are in hiding, they get really panicky. Oh, my God. You know, like that. And then you say, oh, well, I've got it. Maybe it was worth all the grief. I don't think so though. It wasn't really worth it. Was it worth it? No. OK, let's get into the show here and quit with all this BS. But I do like the nice face thing. I do a point. You know, it's amazing how many people can tell you. You're addicted. No, no, I'm not addicted. Yes, yes. Listen, listen, it starts the same with everybody, man. You're addicted. You can't help it. Why do you say that? Because everybody is the same. Everybody curses my face. It's stupid. And then they get married. It's addicted. I've been spending hours on there. Look at everybody else's friends and click it on and see their profiles. I'm not doing that. All right. How long were you on yesterday? How long were you on yesterday? I was on my side for maybe half an hour. You're going to tell me you have been clicked and started looking at some people just because you know, because you look hot. Artisan like that. How fun are your phone free. Have your profile through profile. You haven't gone. No, haven't. We haven't. We haven't done that. Why don't I believe you? Well, well, in other words, now you're calling me a liar. I'm just saying, let's get back to the thing about my will again. OK. I think Christ is yours at what was he? We're getting 50 grand. That's right. Yeah, I got 150. Yeah. Oh, man. So now you tell me then I'm lying. I'm not one of those people that lies about them. I'm also not addicted to this online crap. OK. No one of those people that sits there online. Now, obviously, if I had, you know, if I had to link to some people's red cams and see what they were doing on there, then maybe I might get more addicted. No, I'm saying. OK. Because all these puns today, now they've got their way. Am I right? All these maybe you don't think you got one. A webcam? Yeah. No, I'm not interested. Well, of course, now you've already got your girlfriend. You got your hot chick there and you don't need to be on, you know, with some fantasy relationship. With a webcam, which all these puns are doing these days. But again, like I said, nobody ever got essentially transmitting the disease from cyber-sug. Anyway, here's the poll from yesterday. I hate to admit that I love porn. I don't, I still don't get that. 1532 people. I guess there are a lot of embarrassed people out there. What's the one? I don't get that. Especially with our liberal progressive, you know, perverted audience. But then Josh voted for it to what he expected. I hate to admit I love porn 425. I hate this poll that did very well 233, 15.2%, that we heard to me badly, not. I hate to admit I love Neil Rogers 175. Antisrotio 1117. Talk radio 109, vanilla ice cream 104. The Carpenter's 86. That was my vote. I love their music. Not too crazy about which we carpenter or I'm certainly a Karen, not looking to good these days that I love their music. Dog about 373. Well, good luck to you. The musical's 56, the Food Channel 35, home in Garden, Joe's 22, Neil Sedak 18, country music 17, my space 17. And I see, I'm not ashamed of what I like it. I don't love it, but I do like, no, I guess I do love it. It's a crazy man, yeah, it's a crazy. Well, I mean, the fact that I found my cousin's son on there, and I do know him. I mean, not well, but I had met him in Florida. He was down to with my very wealthy aunt, who is still alive, I find out. See, I got to find out about how my relatives are all doing by going on my space. That's right. See, it's good for something. It is. He's a little bit, I love feet 15. Got a lot of footage people out there. They're sniffing it, and the feet two. World Lays 14, playing Slots 9, and cottage cheese. Oh, it's big and a cottage cheese feet seven. Wow, a cottage cheese, hip, sluck, herstie out. Disgusting, nasty, slut. Oh, what else is? Firefights, what else going on here? I just saw something in my computer. Firefights has downloaded and verified an important update. That's no big deal. Just restart your fireshocks or don't. And the next time you do it, we'll be up there. I'll do it right now. It's installing updates, and we'll start a few moments. And there's Brady Quinn like naked with his abating suit on. Damn it. Anyway, see, if I had links to find the naked pictures of Brady Quinn, and yes, I would be obsessed with my space or wherever it is, I would find them on there. But I'm not going to find it. Oh, what is amazing? Like you can type in naked angelina jolly or type in shirtless, this one or that one. And they're there, you know? Yeah, they're nice. But well, not angelina jolly, but. Well, when we're going to get that video going to miss you, you will say, in Miss Teen USA, what is that going to pop up? Very soon. Can you imagine if we put it out on the ear that if we put it on our my space page that we're on our website, that if you click to our my space page, we've got the video of Miss USA doing Miss Teen USA. We would just blow the whole thing out, would we? Yeah. Overload. Overload, baby. But anyway, we don't have it. One and on, this is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs in your list. Nice to see you. Thank you. And very soon, you're really eating. What's all this? Ooh, a present in John. It's pretty fun. I ain't gonna give a dot try. Overload. Ooh, you make the voters run. Are you the one? Will we pop up with a black guy? Overload. Never set one up. He's on top. And may be the shine for me. So fight. He's an error guy. My, my, my, my, my, my. Whoo! But we're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. We're all over. All right. Well, I'm telling you, man, this, uh, this whole deal is just, uh, uh, life is just turned right around in 24 hours or less. How do you like that? Look at that. When I sound like, uh, my old selfie in now. Yeah, you do. Send it to the press in psychotic and, uh, and of course, that's the problem with internet, man. You don't know what you're dealing with out there. You're just going to use running and hiding and playing in the, uh, you know, it's one thing that somebody has playing with you, but it doesn't feel good. It's not such a good idea. Here's the poll today. 851 votes on the pool. Uh, and I checked the mail on it is no new email. So I, I don't think we're going to integrate in the day that. Are we? I'll just wait for it on the my space page. Well, we've only got eight hundred and seventy once. I like we got thousands. We will eventually, though. I mean, can you imagine by the time I'm 90? Wow. Now I am. I'm going to sign a lifetime deal. I'm going to continue working as long as I'm physically, eight, well, as long as they're willing to continue paying me this kind of money. Ha ha ha ha. Of course cutting down the workload substantially. Well, go ahead and be working five days a week. Especially like right after New Year, sounds good. Cut it back. Like about maybe one or two days every other week, sounds good. Here's the poll and more, what a long poll question. Good. Every time I read it, it's going to kill some more good time. Over the years, what, by the way, thanks for the emails there, more, to your good people. Things are, uh, and I did send you a message, but you'll eventually get it. Over the, and I'll see this is bad because now I'm sending personal messages over the year. Like, uh, you know, which is not good. Oh, is it? Great. Yeah, you like it because you're nosy or busy body. No, I'm not worried that they are. They want to know what's going on. You've whipped them up at this whole personal thing. Well, that whole personal thing is basically over. I mean, come to find out that this is a person who's in hiding and got all panicky when he discovered a new certain things and the other people were like, and so, you know, fine, right? You can't hide all your life, J. I'm telling you right now, you can't do it. You can't, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to move to Vegas and so insurance. What do you think? Squat on that rock. I'm going to swat on the rock and I'll send a picture for our My space page. There's all the deals squatting on the rock. What's that behind all the deal there on the rock? Oh, my God. Well, but he gets to be my age. You can't always control your bodily functions. In fact, I think Johnny G. I just sent this a picture of the other day. They might give you an idea. Anyway, over the years, what person or person's a QM has or have been? See how complicated this is? The subject of meals on your riffing has been the most deserving. I mean, that's the most common looted. But thanks whoever said it, and it says it's not a bad pull. I think it's good. Yeah. But you think any pull is good. And I would agree with you. If we get any question on there that'll get some kind of response. The one tomorrow is pathetic. It's very weak. And you will be changing that later. Let's see if I can get it. I mean, I'm not sure if I can get it. But that's okay. No pressure, Eric. No pressure. Which person's been most deserving of my ripping them in an ass? More Howard? David. David. David. He was 325. Joyce fixed 200. Oh, brother. Now that's a tough choice. I see. I've never met Joyce. Even though I know she's anxious and agnostic and hates me like poison. And we'll do anything in her power to screw up this show. So far, hasn't succeeded. We all that well. But anyway, she's in second. I would say the moment. And you would agree with that. I'm sure. Yeah. I mean, he was just, he was throwing a monkey wrench in everybody's life. Everybody's going to get fired at it because listen here when I do this. And you know, whatever. I hate this pull 83, 9.5%. They're unhappy with the pull. Second day in the world, but not nearly as unhappy as they were yesterday. Greg Reed 62 of very good choice. The serving of this break in this station in the pieces. Nangle across the hall, making a comeback in power 96. And trying to steal away Joe Wells and boys like Josh Cortis there. Now, is that thing, is that finished? Is that, what's the deal? I don't know. Oh, it's the QAMF in way, man. It's just the mystery and the intrigue goes on. See, whoever said it was, this show turned into a soap opera a couple weeks ago. I started with all this personal weeping and gnashing on the ear. It's QAMF. I'm a big important. It's QAM passions. That's it. QAM passions. Without Miguel. Oh, the beesleys 51. It is, is it? Of course, the ill when you're sitting most of your life in a tree is from an advantage. The sales team 37 such as they are. Steve Vellie, Yeltsd 25. Half-ish kicked the lease ass last night, 73 read to the account of the center. Girlly never called me to like, blow to about it. Screw a in 23, that bitch. Scott for rally 18. The engineering staff will. But what are not, I had a dream about Scott for role. I mean, I mean, not like person. I'm not getting that desperate. But I mean, like I was doing the show. And all of a sudden, his voice was starting to come from there. And I feel his him to studio. And who was in the studio? And it was like always, there were people. Wasn't really a view about him. That would be, that would be embarrassing. Scott for rally 18. The engineering staff, 12, the water Nazi 10. Not to be confused with the soup Nazi. They waste that water Nazi. Don't mess with my log. At least you didn't say mess. I think it was worth it beginning with an F. The water Nazi 10. Clarence 7. Well, you know, he and I kind of like we got an understanding now. You know, it's how he stays out of there most of the time. Yeah. But he will be in, oh, look at this. It's already almost 10 30 an hour from now. The ratings. Two thirds of the fall rating book will be coming in. I'll give us some numbers to kill some time with. Jeffrey, number five, Robert Greeper five. You know, I will say this for Greeper though. At least he was honest there because those guys was so impressed that he member JP Morgan. See, I'm sitting here in there like trying to remember who was on the gong who that bull bike all the way. And realize she was a bull bike. But I'm said, JP Morgan in the right away, Greeper is listening because I am but she listens to a lot of our conversation in two. Well, he does. He's not going to turn you on or anything. No, he couldn't believe me. I would ruin their show. He's not going to turn me on. I don't think he's going to turn anybody on. Clarence 7. Jepermer five. The rim man. Greeper five. Jeff high spelled wrong too. Fat boy. For the audience who don't know Jeff high that's her. Hi, I'm fouling. Former fat sales a trouble maker. If you meet foe was got one, I don't even know why we put him on or me foe. Jeff to force. Just got one. We don't like you. By the way, Jeff, we don't want to understand Joe Bell doesn't want any party. 800 and 78 foe. So let's go get to that thousand today. It's not bad. And an hour from now we're going to have to wait and just come in. Let's hope everybody is really, really well. Wouldn't it be good? Yeah. Just to piss everybody. Just to solidify Joe Bell because Joe wants to sign me to weigh five lifetime contract. Even when I'm dead, I'm going to be doing the show. In fact, I'll be doing my space from my place, my special place underground. I mean, because they built this studio in my apartment here in my second bedroom, they could probably put like a microphone in my box. Sounds good? Yeah, I can my box. And Brad Pitt can like stop up and down and I tombstone. Why did that box? And do that routine though. He doesn't do it for a long time. That was always great guy. He think Brad Pitt is hot. He was once upon a time. He's wait to wait for me now. 1026 at 5.60. But by the way, my friend, Moishi is 25. We have people out there very curious about the kind of people that I'm hanging out with. My former email buddy there online, Jay, he was 32. And Moishi's 25 and who else am I? And Brad Pitt, I believe, is like 22 or 3. Like that. Well, forget about Harry, he was like, what? 80. Harry's 180. So don't worry about Harry and I will not be doing any diddler anytime. So not least with each other. Although, looks to me like Harry is trolling the eyespace. Good going Harry, in between your backhand and games, play some of the games. What's all my about to read this stupid story for when I got to do a break here? Well, it's all it. It's the euphoria of being back to myself again. Nice going, Neil. Man, you're a survivor, maybe. For an old fart like you. Yeah. I am. 27 past 10 at 5.60. WQN for less couple of weeks.

It's the same thing. I got to take something really amusing in kind of a sick way. And that is during the break. I checked my space mail. And guess who a friend we crashed. Guess who it was. No, you wouldn't know. It was a little boy. Look at about a four or five year old boy. We're nice. I don't really do that. So fast. I want to end up on day line. I'm thinking for a year. I don't want to be on day line. I'm not in the little boy. Sorry. And we've not put in little kids on our own. My space. I mean, it could have been legitimate. You know, maybe somebody kids are home for the holidays. Maybe it could have been somebody. I put in their cash. But of course, it obviously was not. Don't they put in a little boy's or little girls. Rating out on our my space page. We will come and hunt your ass down. And then we'll want to have selling insurance and biggest on the middle of the red rock, whatever that is.

We got all this excitement going on in my life is a back on scramble again and I got people running and hiding and squatting on rocks and I got my buddy Moishi emailing me from some phone somewhere. Got all those were and all kinds of stuff going on. And of course my good buddy Harry, he's probably in that back amateurs and I'm lying right now. He's okay. He's a good guy. He means well, he's just a little bit too pushy, you know? A pushy guy. WDQ, I am, hello. Yes sir. Hey, now I was just thinking, you know, you say everybody take off speaker.

We should a lot of food here this morning already. Good thing you're there. I'm here for many reasons. The sunny shonen it is beauty is, and despite the fact that leaves really stump the joinout last night in the panther's kick there as similar to three. That was pathetic. I don't watch too much of it. In fact, I was in the phone with the norma kent during a lot of that game and he was giving me a lot of really interesting information. I thought, well, I sure. Thanks, Norma. By the way, see, because everybody I know all of my real friends, they've been during these last couple of trying to bring me back to a state of sanity and reality because of my juvenile and unacceptable and irrational online obsession, you know. Right. And they did. They, you know, they succeeded. But then, of course, when you find out that you were writing the first place, and that you were being a little long enough, people are game players and that they're running and hiding. What are you hiding from the sweet guy? But anyway, 1918 on the pool, all the way I do know what some people are hiding from. It's going to be 45 of the sunny shonen. What it looks like a great wood by Wednesday to me, you know. Now, probably shouldn't say that because here you'll be amailing me any minute now. Oh, God, I thought I'd talk you off those slots.

Well, let me ask you this question because I know you don't like it that much and you had a bad experience there because you don't have a lot of money. But do you think that I'm not, that's not why I didn't like it. Do you think I go there with the idea of I got to win some money today? No, I know you like doing it. What are you? It's fun. So, some of you. Okay. Everybody's got their own fun. Now granted, there are other things that are rather be doing, you know. I'm sure that there are probably some people of legal age there are my space. I probably rather be, you know, taking and escorting them by the hand into my bedroom and having my way with them and just, you know, having a wild time in the other room. And then maybe going through a wood vine, you know, or maybe doing both would be good, right? Right to the machine. And believe me, it's better what you think. I've seen plenty of people in there. I would just, wow, like for a reached out and London a helping hand with their machine or whatever I could do get my hands up. Wow. But you think it's all old-farts in there. It's not. Well, definitely it's not a place to be in their cruising for, you know, don't be doing that. Don't worry. Well, I mean, in your case, you've probably got that girlfriend here. This is right on your shoulder. And let me just suggest this too, because when these couples come in, you know, and you're playing this last, if you want to stand behind your other, you're simply going to be another. You know, I am just realizing that I'm going to have to run in there and do a doose here and say, I'm a joys. Is that right? I don't know why.

It's affecting my innards. Because I thought I was going to have one of those late life accidents in the chair right here now. Maybe it's because of what that other guy said about, let's say plots, my plots. I need to be on the full. We'll get to that thousand easy. They even know it's not one of our, well, it's okay.

He disappeared real fast. He was followed very rapidly. It's almost like this is a test. You know, the mind space emergency system to see how we can push meals buttons. They sure pushed the right one. I'll tell you that. Oh man. Woo. Oh, I did get a response from my cousins son. My nephew whatever he is. Who's a good guy. He's 29 by the way. For the crazy people out there. And then we got a, one of the last three new members on our My space pages name is. Huh? Well, he doesn't, well, he doesn't sure have a name, but it's just you know. You know, I'm saying, 828, one more. Huh? And yeah, he's high school senior. He's been listening since he was 14. He's 17 years old. I'm unfortunately for me. Really, really looks good. But nevertheless, all you people out there, he's right there on our page. And if you want to go to jail like Mike, Miss Kamal, go right ahead. I will give a response, but of course it'll be very measured and very cautious and not too friendly. You know what I'm saying? Hmm. Anyway, it's a 10, 4 left. Five, 60. Why did you give me the this nice face thing with value idiot? Good. Golly Miss Molly. Well, at least it's better to have somebody, you know, who looks good on there as opposed to somebody's mouth breathing. Yeah, I mean, we can't all look great, right? Look at me. For example. Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60. Huh? And pound five, 60 on the Verizon singular wireless line. WQAM, hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing? This is Rick. Please. What's up? They do it. Good. I was just want to know what the Jacob update. If he's working for the Tart Times, the Copina Pomp. Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60. And pound five, 60. You know, actually he's selling insurance in Vegas is what he's going to be doing. One of these days, he is whatever. He's running and hiding and running. Whatever. And now they got my friend, huh, on there. Oh, man. Wow. I can see, I mean, talk about being, I mean, this is a whole different category for what that I was going through. But this is a, I can see that there could be people on there. You know, if, and who the hell knows what you're dealing with? Who the hell knows if it's really the first net claims it's them. You know, they could be using somebody else's picture. You know what I'm saying? Oh, yeah? How did there were somebody posing as me? Really? I believe he's a friend of yours on the, on the site. A friend of mine. Oh, you mean one of, yeah, a friend of mine. I love the way you say that. See, this word friend, you know, with this, my spacing. Oh, you have eight, every December, four friends. Yeah, you should look so on. And all these people are friends as I discovered. But nevertheless, five, six, seven, oh, five, 60. Here's the appell results so far. Because I know that's the most pressing thing on your mind. Now, every break I'm going to be like checking on that thing. And I mean, you're going to turn me like a neurotic, my space person. But I will be like I told you extremely cautious. Okay? Because number one, I'm not, I don't, I'm not like a fish in the sea. I don't bite at jail bait. I don't bite on that. Number one. Number two, I'm not interested in them. I like little, little boys or little girls or little anything. The one thing little I care about is attached to my body. 955 votes on the pole over the years, which person or person's a QM have been the subject of meals on the year, ripping, who deserved it the most?

You're a blunt killer. So you have blue that whole line. Well, I'm emotional now. You don't say? Huh? So look at that. I'm looking for a hum. I can't find him. He must be right. Messages to him. I take it. I'm not writing messages to anybody. I'm doing a show here. I don't have time to be writing messages to people. I mean, what are you talking about? I'm going to write some, I'm message to some hot looking 17 year old kid that just showed up on my space coincidentally, but after some little boy showed up on her, like, I'm really that stupid. Give me a little bit of credit. Okay. I will say this. You know, whether I write a message or not, he sure looks good to me. I'll tell you that. But I'm not stupid now. Although I will be in town soon. Oh, man. This opens up a whole new dimension for all the teases of the world out there. Oh, man. Just put a real subtly look and picture yourself under saying, hey, how you doing? How you doing? Like that. Man. And people will be getting spastic all over the place. Experts says machine setup caused a serosota under vote. And MIT political science professor is an expert on lesson systems testifying yesterday that is statistically unlikely that nearly 13 percent of serosota voters turned out to vote in the Southwest Florida Congressional race that one that we all know was fixed in a bunch of BS. A more likely conclusion we're spending unusually high under vote is that something went wrong and the preparation to voting machines, the expert shall stew it told the judge doing hearing over whether Christine Jennings campaign can get access to computer codes. Used to program the electronic touchscreen voting machines, man. We had some bad machines, man. Store testifying for the plaintiff that confusion over ballot is a unsimbed unlike explanation because far more confusing ballots confusing like you look at it and you go, huh? Such as the infamous Palm Beach County Butterfly Ballet from 2000 had much lower vote error rates. Lawyers for makers of the voting machines, election systems and software encountered that store system on account of the speculation, no one in that there were higher under vote and the customer is an employee of the attorney general's race to never ensure the county on the same machines, man. State officials have declared Republican v. Kennedy winner over Jennings by less than 400 votes out of more than 238,000 cash to the race to replace the anxious vote fixing representative of Catherine Harrison Congress. But 12,49 percent of voters in serosota come in and record a vote in the race far more than the two to six percent of voters in other counties in the congressional district who approve to skip the Jennings v. Kennedy race. But it would be put above. And you say fixed election fixed. Yeah, I think you need to be really very weary about this. So, you know, and especially all far like me, I'm sure that all the punks out there. You know, they've been through the ropes. You know, I'm saying they've smelt it and sniffed it and checked it out and they know what it's all about. Huh? You are really bad. Well, I see that he's sure up on it is one of our friends yet. I don't know. You're going to lift them all? I know. What do you mean by that? Wouldn't what don't the most recent one show up on the most recent page? And believe all you mean for all you perverts out there, leave our friends alone. Okay? I mean, if you want to be friendly, that's one thing. Unless you want to, maybe you can go up there and make license plates with Miss Kamal, some of you perverts. Well, how do we know where they show up? Or don't they show up in an order like that? No, they don't like it. Well, you'll have to do a search, you know? Just keep looking and looking and looking. I'm sure some of you probably will. 1056 a QIM. The girl knew Roger's show. This is your brain. Any questions? Well, my friends, the time is gone. Who did my doctor get you wrong? On the highway, she swears too and too. While the silence play on the old. Because it's just a thing I say in advance. You see her coming run real fast. She goes to Swapapa, the gun's up, get on that. Alright, stop. And it goes in here long. Do you hide? On the highway. On the highway. You hide. You hide. Do you hide? You hide. You hide. You hide. It goes in advance. You see it. But again, I'll just get you out. You hide. She's got her natural manner. And we're at all the flowers. You, you, I have. My mind. She can't drive. Oh, that's the beginning. And I'm right in the middle of sending a very important message. You have messed up my life, Miguel. Go find him and beat him with a club. Alright. Are you not eating more food again, alright? No? Huh? I'm done, man. Oh. Start my guilt says, can I be a friend of your my face? We're up to 875 friends now, by the way. This thing, did not tell you before the show today. It kind of like grows exponentially. And the site too. Yes. I'm growing and growing and it's just like, I like that. It's just amazing. I can remember when we had like a 500 people. It just keeps getting bigger. Yeah, you said it, Jennifer. I want to have Jennifer Remis doing. You wouldn't know. You don't all these people. No. She was a she's a nice person. She's great. See, I'm like a lot of the people you've met in this business who are real A whole. She was a sweetheart. Like Jennifer Lot. Hope, but have you all day Jennifer? Jennifer Remis. And Terry Griffin and all about our other friends. We have so many. And of course, Pete the abort up chronic who called yesterday. Anyway, it says, hey, you can be a friend in your mind space. This is stuttering you'll pull idea. How soon will the Julios return to Cuba after Castro dies? Yeah, right. Likely story. Likely story. So I got another message on there for my close personal friend. Huh? Who was in certainly not the four year old boy? Oh boy. Oh boy. What? Hey, listen, I'm, I listen. Anybody's not invited you over to the house or anything, right? No, no, no. I'm more in Florida. He's very evasive and I am writing to him. That's a very good idea that anybody who looks like that, more evasive and better. I'm just telling you right now, man, this, this is like taking a stick of dynamite, lighting it on fire and sticking it right up your back though. You won't say him? So he's very, very weary because you don't know who you're dealing with on the other end. You know, you have no idea because there are a lot of really crazy people out there as you well know. But nevertheless, WDQAM hello. What a plan. Ah, yeah, huh. WDQAM hello. Me or you don't, you don't give me a chance. You never give me a chance. You never give me a chance. You're right. I, well, you, I would didn't and I won't. Nobody wants to give you a chance. That's why you have, uh, I have no life. But, uh, pathetic. Hey, listen, Castro is going to be dead any minute. And I'll be, you get on a banana boat and go back. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 in the horizon singular. Fireless line, we're making incredible strides into the 21st century boys and girls. We're starting to like, uh, in fact, this is going to be, well, the hip is Joe and his to the human race with a, uh, 64 year old daughter-in-old fart host. How you like that? That's right. A documentary says French special forces had Osama bin Laden in their sights twice about three years ago, but their US appears never order than to fire. The French military, hi, ever said that the incidents never happened and they report was a wrong news information. Right. The documentary we do there next year and seen by Roderous yesterday says the troops could kill the al-Qaeda even Afghanistan, but the order to shoot never came, possibly because it took too long to request it. Or are we on top of things or what? Not. In 2003 and 2004, we had been Laden, our sights and stuff were said I have been Laden and anonymous French soldiers quoted as saying the documentary we've been Laden, the feelings of a manhood, is by journalist Emmanuel Rosave and Eric Delavra, some frog name, who worked for a civil major French media outlets in Afghanistan, a cable TV channel fence where the documentary in March. In March, did you let it be the one year anniversary of somebody's DUI? Rosave said the soldier tripped in the roughly and then he was supposed to say, huh? No, I didn't have no idea. I don't know. I don't know that much about, huh? Oh, you're going to. Why do you say that? Oh, I just got a feeling. Let me ask you a question. Because I have nothing but revulsion for all these pedophiles that seek out miners online. Because if you're taste-run, like little kids, then you ought to like probably blow your brains out. But if you're taste-runs to like like this, fully, for example. Why do they have to be chasing down in 16 year old pages? Like when they have gone after people were like legal. Although I will say, I don't know, from what we hear, he was like, you know, he was grooming them when they were like 16 and 17. And then when they got to be 18, when they got to be legal age, then he was a doing. They were grooming and doing. Doing grooming. Yeah, that's right. That was Mark Folligan. I wonder what he would think of, huh? I wonder what any self-respecting queen would think. I know what they would think. It's just for fun, man. It's just for fun. But what I'm saying is that it's obvious to me now how it's so easy to get sucked in. That's a bad expression there, but nevertheless, you know what I'm saying? Yeah? Who now knows what you're dealing with? And it's this to me, the timing of it's not that I want to insult anybody because I just don't know, but it just seems very strange. Well, speaking to that, speaking of gay, 73 percent of US military members would accept openly gay lesbian service members being in their units according to a new polaroise by Zagbe International and the Michael D. POM Center. Over one in five response to the survey said they know for certain that somebody in their unit is gay or lesbian. You're fairly. The survey was conducted at both combat and on combat units according to a statement issued by the service members legal defense network in a pain by page 1Q. We know what the Q stands for. Today's poll is one more nail in the coffin of Don't Ask Don't Tell, said, see Dixon Osborne, Executive Director of service members legal defense network. He said the statement. The survey included over 500 troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. 45 percent of them. Can you imagine knowing the number of Proverts that we have listing out there how many of them are scouring our mice face and the page right now looking for. Can you imagine that? Well, how about giving out the, you know, the URL since a lot of people I'm sure aren't even mice face. They don't have mice face. Face.com slash Neil God. There you go. That's what you got to do. Well, we have a nice link to it on our, on our Neil Rogers page on the arroges.com. It's right above Al Gore's picture. It's way way down there way under the polo. I was looking at that this morning thinking, well, that's way, maybe, uh, Eric got to move that baby. You think he can do it. Can you do that? No, I can't do that. But he can move the link. And move it up in a real prominent position. We can get 80 million people on my space and then get all kinds of trouble. Hey, listen, there's no law against looking. Okay. When I look at some of these people as, uh, I just like Miss Foley. Like that. What's wrong with that? Well, even Jimmy Carter had lusted his part in his heart. Did he say that? Something like that? Yeah, something like that. Yeah, something like that. lusted this heart. And you show me any, any person that doesn't have lusted in their heart. I'll show you somebody that's dead. I don't care what anybody says. All these liars out there. All these goody two shoes. All these. Oh, well, I'm a happily married man. Well, it's great. I'm happy for it. We can still got lusted in your heart. Especially if you're married to some old bitch. I mean, nagging old bag. The survey included, uh, over 500 troops are served in a racking afghanistan. 45% of veterans of those wars indicated that all of the day were not certain. There was a gay or lesbian member of the unit. They suspected that there was. They can't be sure, but there's a lot of. Looking into showers. You understand a lot of real. Yeah. The survey responses represented dramatic change from 93 to 13% of service. Remember, so they supported the rights of gay's and those beings to serve openly in the military. I may not be reading well to them. A little bit tongue-tied for some reason. Oh, man. Woo. I just can't believe this show. I just can't understand what you're. If you know this, the turn that we've made here in the last couple of weeks. Yeah, a little bit. We've taken a turn. I think it's a big improvement too. You know, I could be wrong about that. Maybe some of the old fights out there. We don't want to hear about all of this. The disgusting sexual and inner. And of course, whether they know about the internet, you know, right, some of those old-futty-benty people. You know, I think they're a few months of coming to the new, you know. That was, see, I feel bad for the Humper because he at least worked off some calories that tapping on the, you know, on the keyboard. You know what I'm saying? He's just stubborn. I don't know, maybe he's not anymore because I haven't talked them in quite a while, but do you think that he's doing computers stuff now? And maybe of course Larry King, you know, who doesn't do the internet? Because, wow, I've got all those buttons and stuff, you know, a bunch of buttons. And of course, in Larry's case, when he's holding this suspenders up with one hand and using the other to like squeeze his bag, you know, it's kind of hard to get involved in all this stuff. You know what I mean? Huh? 560560 and possibly 560, they've horizoned in singular wireless line. WDQAM hello. WDQAM hello. I'd say hey no, I'd say hey no, I'd say. I'd say wait, excuse me. I'd say wait. Okay. I wonder if the art of Yiddish is a dying smet. That was not Yiddish. So he was, of course, he's dovething in Hebrew. But we're a hot-tod, a knob, a rape-ree, I've got thin, no boy, that one looks pretty good to me. Whatever it is. Nice. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha. Close the door. Man, that's your is. Somebody QAM, hello. You know, I'm sick of people complaining about whether there's a Christmas tree or manure. I'm not even religious, and I'm getting a tree. I'm a celebrated, just because it's fun. And positive. That's the piece of a follow-in-millot in cellar. You go, boy. I have to go. I'm going to go. This thing is not real sharp anymore. This box may have to be replaced.

You just didn't get it and he did my close former friend there Who the one that's running and hiding and solving insurance and biggest?

Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. And don't forget just a matter of days before the new governor Charlie Christ with a gay lympharist gets this warning. Anyway, I got new wallpaper on my desktop. Oh boy. Oh boy. That's what I'm saying. No, why do you say that? Why are you so negative? He's he's squatting too. No, he's not. I don't know. He's sitting in a restaurant somewhere. Huh? Somewhere. I don't know. He's my new wallpaper. My good, close person with friend now. I'll see if this is good because this is somebody I have never met. Never will meet. And it's just, it's what, see this is fun. If you keep it in perspective. And hopefully I will. Although you never know. You know how emotional we all are. And it makes me sit here thinking about the good looking young people in the world. And on the one hand, you curse them because you say, lawyer, you're all about your teeth is man. You like to applaud it. And stick all your beautiful good looks in our face. And then on the other hand, you think, Yeah, but what's that kind of a world would be without those people? And that latter one, I think is much more important to me. Like in Berlin, man. Man, the people there. Wow. It's just enough to make you want to drop your pants right there in the kudam. But nevertheless, it's 1134 which means they're giving away stuff at the original Superman and Evan Tura. So you guys, they brought the soup and the charred from the burgers. Right. Why? And here on the one hand, I had to go into a joy stare during one of those breaks in a half hour ago. Wow. Like your joy, and we were, ah, ah. Now actually right now, thanks to all this, my space that I'm rejoicing. Is that what's supposed to do during these holidays? We joists. That's right. And have a real gay time. Giving away free samples at the original Superman and Evan Tura starting a four minutes ago. They're doing a right now. T shirts to the first time where people who show up at the grand opening will be Friday. If you're a suit lover like I am now, see I'm curious. What else do they have? I mean, is it a place where it's like a regular restaurant and suit for you? No, yeah, they have a they have wraps, salads, smoothie, and we've. Hold on. Let me, let me go over here and get a menu. That will be a good idea since they brought something. Yeah, they're wrapped. I already played that. You'll be ill. I might just play that the whole rest of the show while I can Versus with some of my friends on it. Yeah, they got soup. They got soup. They got sandwiches, wraps, smoothies, the whole. Yeah. The whole shabang. A whole surmang. Anyway, it's a 20475. This game pulled about in the problem of Shops. The original Superman can't fit in was based on the soup, not the inside film. I wonder if Mike, what's his name is going to be showing up there, Richard? That was bad. I shouldn't say that. But I did. This little joke, okay. If you can't handle a joke, you should be listening to the show. If you're too serious, if you're sitting around listening in your underwear and getting all the work done. There are some people doing that right now. They're sitting around by the radio. They got a cranked up. We're like, oh, I heard him say, I know what he's thinking. Yeah, right. You don't know what I'm thinking. You think you know what I'm thinking. But do you know what I'm thinking? And I'm glad that some people don't know what I'm thinking because they give off of that page real facts. Hey, now, do you want the ratings starting to come in? You want everything? You want everything? You want everything? Huh? You want everything? Like, I got many team plus. Do you want to get them now? That's what I got right now. I hope brought an insurance was he smiling or frowning. Now, what's your boy, Greeper? He brought me. Oh, Greeper? Well, of course, in his case, how it could you tell if I told him once I've told him behind times, get a little bit of emotion in his life. But never let. Yeah, there's something in whatever you got. I got a lot of facts, paper over there. It'll kill some really good time. And allow me to converse with all my good, close personal friends in my my space page. This is just, I mean, who the hell would have ever thought that an old toe like me? And haven't I said a minute times? What? I could have thought. What? That would be on a my space thing. Yeah. We'd have to tell him that you could become obsessed with my space. No, I'm not saying I'm obsessed yet. What is Harry again? By the way, Harry, stay away from Ha. Okay? Hey, listen, Ha, if Harry approaches you, stay away. He's an old, a frag. Maybe that's not the, oh, this is not the Harry from Detroit. I'm a scotsenery, not Detroit. Well, I don't know about Detroit. I was scotsenery. It's just that you were bulletin of, oh, I see that too. The thing from SNL about the, um, **** in a box. I'm bulletin of box. I guess we can say that. Right. Right. Right. And anyway, he said this place is a Ted slonish. I don't understand what he said. This plate, that old that place Detroit is a Ted slonish, right. Thanks for the man where he says Harry. So this is what's causing, Harry. Not that they confused with the, the other Harry. Got it. So if I, Harry, the back end and guy contacts your huh. I would just, uh, I would dump his ass real fast run on run into the desert and squat. Maybe we can get pictures of husks, squatting on the air in red rock cannon. I'd be a big improvement. I'll tell you that. Now let's see, or these are the ratings coming in right now. Let's see, many team plus six team to midnight. This is for first indication. Okay. Right. Oh, no. Really bad. Radio, mom B. That means all the old, the Julios. No speaking in glass got all the diaries. From number four in a summer to number one in this trend. September October to November. Two thirds of the fall book. Radio, mom B. But again, that's all old. Oh, look at that QM nice jump up there. Look at that. Two seven in the summer. A three five in this trend up from a three in the last trend. And then nice. That's overall of course. Very nice. We went from 18th to number nine. And that's why we for Rottenman. We're number, yeah, I didn't mean overall. No bonus money for that though. But then again, this isn't the whole book. If we get a, if we get a big December in the course. Now we got all these living and breathing people out there on my space. I had your place. And I'm saying, yeah. Well, I'll be damned. And it's finally lacking promotion by the Beesley corporate loan and takes it. We're still men and we make our building our own audience and our own my space page one of the time. At eight hundred and seventy six friends out there. Some more important than others of course. I guess I'm going to have to get chicken after doing several drop-ins. Like, huh, like that. And I'll be going, uh huh. Well, they're about one that he did for me. Remember? Well, time. All right. It's supposed to be me. Oh, yeah. There is. Uh. Oh, yeah. Ha ha ha. All right. Woo. Ha ha ha. Uh. A couple more times. Uh. Uh. Uh. What's goes? Anyway. Okay. Let's not get off on that tangent because it sounds awfully fay and awfully embarrassing. I've had enough personal investment on the show of my own making, by the way. I have no regrets. I've had so many things like that. I've had so many things like that. I've had so many things like that. So, that's a couple of weeks. It's just a call being honest with yourself. You know what, what the hell do I care? Because I see I've told you this one thing before. I don't live my life based on what other people think. I, uh, you know, I just did do it. I just, uh, call it like I see it. And I live my life as I have you it. And that's it. And that's it. And I don't like it. That's for you. Including you, Joyce. And any other de-wrainge individuals out there. Okay. Let's look at the morning. I bet you're Kenny and Howard. Kicking ass. You're talking to a little sports and talking about all the sex. Radio Mombine, everyone in the morning and many teen plus with a six forward. Is anybody believe that? Oh, old Julios man in domino park. If they were smart, they'd be playing back game and they're playing dominoes. Hot 105 dropping, uh, oh, they're tied for first with a six forward man. WSDJ FM, more no speaking, ways. Radio Mormore, no speaking, ways. We haven't got a chance. How do we even compete in a market where nobody's speaking in place? Big drop from a six in the summer to a five three. That's Iran and the old Paul. That's Iran who spends a lot of time on his my space page too, by the way. CNQ FM, no speaking in places, six for the four five. The needy are I'm looking for us QBA. All these ethnic states, not only old ritmo. Wow, wow, wow. I OD from a three five down to a three three and QM in the morning. We went from a one seven in the summer to a two seven. That's here for Kenny and Bowen toast and those of Graham. From 19 to 13th through the two seven in the morning. All right, what about what about across the street? We can't read the ratings without mentioning about them. Even the life thing for basically out of business. Chris was told me that they really need help. Is that what you were saying? Yeah. He said they suck over there. Although they went up a little bit in the morning from a two to two to a two four. Joe Rose got rid of his two two and I was running a two four two by four. So that ain't much. And radio, what about the air, scare America? They even still on the air after the bankruptcy. They went from a one four to a two two. Look at that. They went from 23 to 18. So we did okay there in the morning and then we'll see what happens in the day after the break. While I check out, you know, some things online here. Look, I'm going to be a busy guy. If I'm going to be able to keep up with all this. You know what I'm saying? I actually know how I was. The biggest name. So best talent to the business. We all rock. Pacing your on Q.A.M. You don't have any national guards in it because they're all fighting a war in the wreck right now. Not the national guard. Not the national guard. Not the national guard. Not the national guard in the wreck. Not there's no national guard at now. They're going to be like, drop here in the tank. She's kind of a tight driver, central pong. You look that mean. So quish a little bit. I could tell he was in the dark. So I acted out my pocket, she read. And with my arms, the trees are made. There's no bug, speaks English and a muggle. I went down to my, you know, I met with which where the way I was. And I walked into a red dust storm. But the guard there's hot real fun. Guys, and walk kind of, fortune be me just not to end up. What does that mean? The mud is too English. I got him more. That corner's deadly. Hell, I think I've been Pakistan. I think it was a melee. Or you can go back to the war, right? Or you can go back to the war, right? I came here to the gohmer. And I went my A.B. seat. I don't say much as grossies. I'm so pretty. So get yourself to a classroom quicker in America now. Stop making me sick. I've been on the spot as speechless. I've been on the spot. There's my suggestion if there's any tourists that there might be accidentally finding our show if you're a driver around town, you stop at a gas station convenience store. And you can't understand what tell these people are saying to you, just say, uh-huh, like that. Right? Yeah, that's it. That's a good way to communicate this out for me, just, you've seen that. 1989 votes. I've been busy answering all kinds of stuff, and not just, uh, like that either, okay? See, that's a problem. You understand that I'm bonding with our listeners out there. You think it's all about, fuck, it's all about, you know, getting pictures of some hot look in the young dude, you know what? I mean, you know, that's fine. I don't have any late-stany webcams yet, and nor do I, you know, hahahaha. Oh, this is just, it's a whole different world. It's like I've fallen off the earth, and I've been on some kind of a spaceship, and later than on another planet. You don't see? I've left the earth and laid it on your reignus. Okay, let's see the back of these numbers. Now, we kicked some big fan ass by the way, did I give the morning number or what? I think I did that, didn't I? Yeah, you did for the break? Yes. Radio Mumbi, which is old Julios, and of course, the good part for the good news for us about that is once you get back to normal that we're grabbing 25, 54, and drops off all those old parts like me, because who cares about 55 plus? Anybody care about us? No, except those nice people on our mice-based page. Oh, God. Anyway, I'm in a day. Many team plus, CNQFM69 is number one. No, speaking, glazed. Radio Mumbi's 67, and again, keep in mind that's old. I wouldn't be surprised if we were number one. When we get to 25, 54, even these two months, because we went from a four, six in the summer to a four, five in the first friend of the fly, and now a five, five. And it's 10 to three. So that means 10 to two, we're like about a six. Got it? Yeah. IOD from a five-old to a four, nine. There's about there about flat. We're moving on up in there about flat. Love 94, hot 105. How magic do they're in a morning? I probably ought to look at that tonight, or buddy, Ricky Tickey. What's all this heat carry is getting out anyway? By the way, congratulations to you. I'm not retiring. I've changed my mind. And you know what? What has given me? Well, besides my friend Moishi and all my other friends in the normal. And all the, what's given me the inspiration to continue for least another 50 years when it's time you'll know? That's part of it when it's time you'll know. When I think about retirement, I think to myself, and then I say, no, I don't think so. Right? Right. You don't even know who I'm talking about. You're like, you're sitting there. I've been going to you during every break. You're scouring that page up. Yeah, who's it? I just searching for them. Yeah, no, you're not. I mean, just out of curiosity. In other words, you tell me you're not the least big curious to see who this is. That I'm making such a big issue about here. Well, what do you mean? I can't, you know, all right. Can't, well, I'm going to look for them right now, okay? No, you don't have to do that. No, I'm going to. Okay. Let me know when you find them. Now, where am I going to find them? Is it, did he? Oh, I don't know. When you want to get friends, I mean, yes. Jesus, I'm going to have to look through all your friends. Well, you only got 1876 friends. You'll know when when you see him. Okay. He's got like a Navy attesture, though, with some yellow lettering, I don't know why. He said, like at a table in a restaurant. We have to get all this, you know, LV. Because now, of course, I know there are a lot of these purverts that they're going to be looking. They're going to be on it. They're going to be searching. They're going to be scouring. Of course, he just says he's somewhere in Florida and he's like an anonymous. Good thick and, huh? Good thick and he knows that, you know, and he knows that people are looking that. Of all persuasions in the going, they're not just going, huh? They're going like that. A lot of hugs. See what I'm saying? Anyway, he's taking the show today. He's been listening to it when he gets home from where we're taking it right now. And I would suggest one thing. I know there are a lot of people out there that get all excited when somebody talks about about the attention and that. But just to when you listen that tape, keep your hands above the counter, okay? CNQFM is number one in midday with a six hour. I just have to reading these. She's not that I'm distracted, right? Think like that. Must be your fault. It's me. Actin' it was three to seven. A radio on more, a five nine in men. Number one. No speaking in glaze. A radio on being. No speaking in glaze number two. It's just a Julio World man. CNQFM. No speaking in glaze number three. A EDR fan more ethnic stuff. Four three number four. And hot one or five. All the top five in afternoon drive are ethnic. Black and Hispanic etc. And then big and the NXJ magic and global 94. Where in hell are we in the afternoon? Oh, there we are. First down the next page. From a two four in the summer to a three seven. All right. Nice going Joe Bell. I told you it should not a long time ago, but it's better late than ever. Now I know what I want from my rating bonus because it's obvious that we're going to make a nice bonus on this one. The full book comes out in a month. You following me? Kind of. Oh, you're busy looking. I'm sorry. You're looking to see what you know. Oh, no, I'm not. Now I'll start doing that now. No, no, no. No, in lieu of the cash from my Christmas bonus, I just want. I see. I would be as a tenth with a three six. And then I and Z.S. skier America went from a two four up to a three four. Woo, look out now. Man, they're on the move. Now that's a bankrupt. That must be who is that? Spank and Al Franken or no, it's the afternoon. I'm who's on. And I don't care.

need to have a survey for this and of course the guest he's out there releases would say oh you've made that's a sin yeah everything's a sin yeah everything that's good anyway that is correct if feels good if it tastes good if you like it if you want to do it again it must be really bad and that is going to punish you for it that's why he invented in the first place because he's a statistic bastard almost all Americans have premarital sex has to be poor publish yesterday that emailizes federal data over time and suggest programs focusing on safe lessons until marriage maybe unrealistic let me say it again unrealistic the reality of the situations that most people had premarital sex and it's been that way for several decades at Lawrence finer director domestic research at the good locker room student New York City based on like a bunch of Nazis the good locker wants to the New York City based on proper organization that studies reproductive and sexual health the study which used to tickish uh all see this is chopped off again on the edges is bad as 40,000 people ages 15 to 44 and trace the trends of primarital sex back to the 50s of those interview in 2002 95% before they had had premarital sex 93% of the women born in the 40s nearly nine intended it and this is going to make too much sense because the part of it's chopped off but I don't care you know it's 20th of you so

I wouldn't be surprised if it was 100 degrees out there. Either that I'm just getting emotional in my old age. Maybe I'm just getting all here. Look at that. It's already 40-45. And I'm toasty for the 20-50CM. And I'm here too much screaming in the oven about those nice ratings we had. That's two-thirds of the fall book. Hello? Yeah. Oh. I'm in the sports, I guess. What do you mean by that? Well, he's not here. He's not here. He's doing an ace in the doze because he had all of that food all of that soup. I wonder how it went over there with the original soup man in Evan Chura. Which we think of again for all that delicious soup ever. Now did you partake? I had a little bit. I wasn't really into seafood, so I had some of the vegetable chili. I see. Not too much. Not too bad. Pretty good. Not too bad. Well, not really into like the vegetable soup. But since you've seen... I'm not like the vegetable soup. The vegetable soup is going to have to come in here and give you some lessons. It's like great. There you go. Now I'm sure it was very good. But I'm not into vegetable soups for those pretty good. Anyway, the original soup man is a 20475-speaking little bar in the Promenade Chura. And it features the get-rated soup of Al-Yagina. You again, huh? Am I saying that right? Sure. Who inspired the soup episode on San Phil? Are you doing watch San Phil either? Nope. Good. You got the job. The storm is located as a 20-second original soup man. Open since the franchise concept was launched last year. And they got all the stuff they got wraps into the wrap and it and whatever else. So maybe that's what Josh is doing right now. Rappin it. Maybe like with a scene from it. Yeah, he just walked in here. I'm back. I hear that you were like unloading some of those 85 meals you had today already. I've been surprised me at all. Now what was I asking him before? I don't know. I asked you something mighty important. And of course Chris is. Remember because he wasn't paying any attention. I was loading the spots at the time. Don't worry. I'll get you those my space passports. Oh, that's very important. Make no mistake about that. I know what I was thinking about. For example, because I know that when I directed you to that page 18, there of our all 80 million friends. And I'm sure you clicked on that thing. Hopefully that you were going to find some more in front. And maybe even confabulate with my close personal friend. And tell him, hey, you ain't nothing man. You're like, ah, just like that. That's what I did. He's got a set to private. I know. So all you purverts out there that want to confabulate with the people under. Just because they look really smokey. Uh, forget about that. He, he only, you know, like other people that said stuff to private because they're running away, you know. And I'm confident that my new close friend isn't going to run away any time. Soon, and probably any time at all. Well, that is this has been a banner week. Not just a banner day, but a banner week for me. It's just been the unbelievable. Never want to thought so weak ago. Of course you were on vacation week to us. And I noticed by the way that you were on our my space page last week. Why do you run vacation? No, I won't. And I had you once. What are you talking about? You were on there, man. Listen to me. I didn't bring a cell phone, let alone a computer. You were on there. No. Or maybe it was somebody in person that you were getting on there. Maybe, I don't know. Well, that's what your buddy says. I'm like he said that, you know, he understands that people go on there and see your picture in person and pretend to be you. Now how did you find out about that? Because they were, they were one of your friends and they were posted in your, you know, top friends and it was a picture of me. Yeah. And his name was like Steve or something. I don't know what his name is. Probably some old thing. Yeah. Some 120 to you. Both we got the 13 I would like to I believe. I mean, not necessarily we need 77 mole in 55 minutes. But I think that should be a no drain or man. Dog Thompson. And excuse me for a week and stuff on here. But I'm going to do a couple of many way. Dog Thompson because he hasn't had one of his rants in a few days. And capital Hill Booth out coming. I loved dog Thompson. He's one of my favorite writers. But, you know, he's he's in hiding. Like a lot of people these days. He's in hiding. And he's got good reason to because the government is coming after his ass. After voters overwhelmingly rejected President George W. Bush's illegal in favor of Warren Iraq tossed out the corrupt Republican leadership of Congress and send a strong message that things needed to change and change right away. It appears we're back on the same old dead end road to a war that won't end. Can't be one led by a president who won't listen and aid in a bit of a Congress that won't stop him. They heading on the column, by the way, is there's more things change than more they say the same. Bush and interview with the Washington Postman, it clearly has to be that he'll send more American troops to fight and die in Iraq because he still laborers out of the illusion that his failed work can be won. And it looks like the new Democratic leadership of Congress will let him do so without questioning or re-crimination. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, city supports an increase in true bubbles to restore stability in Iraq, but claims that increase should only be temporary and the troops must be brought home. In other words, like that. In the House, Speaker to be Nancy Pelosi has told Democrats to let him investigate Bush or even in Pichun to cool it. And she says she in the leadership will seek ways to work with the White House, a bitch. I'm not surprised at Reid's capitulation says Doug Thompson is a corrupt, bribe-taking-world school politician with a growing, defends what they did in history in the Somestate and Nevada. He knows that playing the war boundaries is good for business as well as his campaign war chest and Reid has a long history of getting rich off his political contacts. By an expected war of Pelosi, the San Francisco liberal who promised to bring change to the House. But Pelosi's no reformer, how she's the daughter of Thomas Dillacangro, the mob controlled mayor who turned Baltimore over to organize crime during his reign of corruption in the 40s. Pelosi likes to bribe that she learned politics at her father's feet and looks like she learned her lessons well. As soon as the Democrats won the November-Mintermalitions, Pelosi took impeachment of Bush agenda and many of it was just a campaign gimmick. In impeachment is off the table at a waste of time, she told 60 minutes, he has to utter how much summer public in fact can't pay for that decision, another corrupt politician bought. Says Doug. He says, let's look back to what's happened since the November-Mintermalitions. The Democrats weaved to power in the House and Senate aid by a straighted by a strong anti-war sentiment from voters, then they immediately stopped talking about any firm timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, Pelosi tells her incoming chairman to forget about impeachment. Today, after the election, Bush fired defense secretary Rumsfeld, the public face of the war and a post-formal CIA had Robert Gates who tells Congress that we're losing the war. The Iraq state of repression is its long-awaited report urging diplomacy and saying combat troops should be withdrawn by 2008 and replacing it by moralitarian advisors, but the bottom line of the ISD report is that the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. Just like the numbers across the street, grave and deteriorating. Gates then starts talking about the need to win an Iraq, the same nonsense line with Rumsfeld Bush and Chinese. The Pentagon says it needs more troops in Iraq to complete the mission and Bush admits the U.S. is not winning the war and says more troops are necessary to win. We're back to where we were before. More Americans dying in Iraq would plan to send an even more to die. More billions wasted in the war that most military experts say can't be one no matter how many troops we send in. A president who continues to do whatever he then will pleases and a Congress that will sit on this collective ass and do nothing. Nice going, Doug. I tell you, huh? Doug, Doug, Tom, Tom, he's the best. When you say he's the best or one, be very best, yes you would. Yeah, you can know you don't pay attention to these stories every. I read a little bit of a sometimes. I'm not talking about the ones I send you to put on the website. I'm talking about the ones I sit here and peep my guts out, sweating and bleeding over hot microphone. We need to hear on the show every day. You're probably on your damn mice face there. Check it out. Some hot chick at the on there right now wouldn't surprise me. And I sure hope that you're rushing girlfriend don't find out about it. Because from what you were saying yesterday, she's a little bit of a jealous size. And what you were saying? No, no, no, no, I just got myself in a bind. Well, what does that mean? I don't want to put you on the spot. I don't need to get put on the spot. I'll tell you exactly what happened. There's a girl that I ran into that you used to see. You ran onto my hands, ran into her and kind of met up with her on the down low and got caught. And that's it. You met up with her down low on the down low. How far down and how low? That's what we want to know. So you got in trouble on the end of the listen. It's good. It's strength and stability of the fact that you were screwing around on the side. I mean, you were like, you know, and the fact you were able to overcome that. You know, when you have a tiff like that. Now let's see, all of this, that's it's good because it's long time. Everything is calm down on my space. I was getting exhausted. If I had to do that every day, I would collapse. I couldn't do that. Because during every break, I've been sending messages back to people and I've been like, getting the next bit ready when we come back and getting the hell. And of course now I got my shirt on, which this break is the, put your pants on, break on what by Wednesday. You think that's too much information or you think that probably the audience is concerned about. I think they like to know. Well, they're concerned. They want to know about all of these things. Here's the pool so far. We got the 237 votes. Only two contenders on this baby. Over the years, which persons in Eola's, written as on QM deserved it the most. It's strictly Moe enjoys. And the Moe, they think about it the Moe, they think it's Moe. Oh, no, no, no, I think they're right. 462 Moe, Howard David, it did. And 257 for Joyce. And I hate this pool. It's up to 10.5% on 31. That would be, you know, between yesterday and today, there's a lot of hate. There's a lot of hate about these pool. Have you noticed that? And this is supposed to be that time of year for love and peace and brotherhood. There's always a lot of hate. Yeah, but this time of year, when you think that there would dispense just for the hate? No, man, oh, man. Of course, I can't be worried about hate because I'm worried about things like love. Huh? The biggest thing, so best challenge to the faces of your Rogers, is course video 560. You, A, M. You got, R.W. A, M. Where the faggin' is. The Federal Food and Drug Administration is joining the investigation of the E.C.O.I. on Break That Taco Bell. No, it is on the E.C.O. on Outward. The majority of their films, A, to Taco Bell. Well, I drove down to get a beamboard at home. Taco Bell was calling out to me. Felt like I was shot with a torpedo. And then I got explosive number three. Then my thru-one tire, left the way all trees, met my thru-one, left me to my knees. I was a plane, signed my toy land. Then my thru-one, but it wasn't over. Oh, fly, I'm so sick, didn't I sick, I am sick of the new, and pause the hall, and keep waving down, or look at me, you've been seen stuff. I was 12,3 hours, who'd have spanned, and you're the one who's been made. You can see my string. Oh, that's a lovely string, you know? Oh God, no watcher, I can't imagine the first one. Don't make me cry the way. I'm so fond of making these a way to show. I saw a hole, three, a wall, a hole, a hole, a hole. Then my thru-one, my thru-one, I was weak, with gay soldier feeling, and on my tongue, I started growing. What a lovely thought for the hall, he's 18 at five, 60. I love that bit. I'm not a good boy, I'm not a bad boy. I know you're doing. You can play it all the way to a clock. I say, I just said my final message to parrer the day, at least for the daytime hours. I can tell you, right your back, but go ahead. And I made a good point. And I mean, even when you're emailing people, I'll generally speak in you email people who you know and you've seen you're email addresses. You know what I'm saying? Generally speaking. It's a different experience. What would this thing like like happening you and just like he said, you've been anybody can put your picture on here and say, oh, I'm Josh Cortes, you know. And then you're communicating with them and you don't, and they can put anybody's picture in return and you don't know who that you're really talking to and the same with this thing. But it's always nice to have good pictures, you know what I'm saying? That's the best thing. Yeah. Just keep that in perspective, okay? Just look at the picture and put a big smile on your face and then move on with real life, okay? This virtual life and you know what it reminds me of? This whole Cybersex thing and I must of course were talking about the video cams which I know that every kid over the age of five is not got the video cams, things sort of like, you know, they're eyeballing each other, is there a speaking? I wonder if we're all still doing, you know what I'm saying? No, because I'm not into that, but whatever, but whatever, but other than that if you don't have that ability, then you really don't know who you're getting all emotional and involved with on there. So that really makes it that much more of a fantasy, which if you just accept it is that, then it's fine, you know? It's like phone sex. Like these guys are called the 800 numbers or 900 numbers and they're talking to some big old fat mama out there who looks like her stile in a bad day before she found a call Jenny and they're getting all whipped up and excited and they mean to me. If they saw them in person, they would like vomit from thinking that they were like getting you know what I'm saying? Yeah. There you go. But then again, if you want to live a real life or you want to win a fantasy about that, that's what it's all about. 560, 560 and the Verizon SIGGETER RIDE OF SLEIN. You're going to get a ZINION calls in between now and two if we get them. If we get them, that's the operative line.
