Such swill in its newspaper big 106 not hurt by shock-jock loss. Oh my god. Oh This has got to be the dumbest you could understand this maybe like in the weekly reader, you know Maybe like in a in a grade school newspaper did you ever make um as probably before your time we used to like print stuff on gelatin Jellaton yeah, you never know that make copies. Oh, we made a lithographs We do it a carve stuff out and make prints No, but this was on gelatin No, when I was a kid that's the way used to make copies of stuff. We didn't have like printers You know copyright So you used to have like a gelatin and you have like purple ink. I don't know the whole thing We've made copies that way even those of us kids used to do that never printed such garbage as The mommy hurled us on a regular basis you people are evil man. You're the anti-Christos You're the anti-Christos you are just brutal the swill that you put in your newspaper And haven't only they must be jumping into bed with cheap channel. I wouldn't you think yeah, I'd look like it You see we got the hero that takes on a one hand. They got the very jackass column. He's the mouthpiece for Greg Reed And then evidently in the business section there the mouthpieces for our clear channel And well we get to a first behind the beaded curtain today. We've got Elizabeth Grayson Who was born April 3, 1960 which makes her last time I checked 44 old lady Born in Ozark Arkansas her real name was Elizabeth Ward Not kind of interesting not not real interesting but kind of interesting you change your name from Elizabeth Ward Which is kind of easy rules right off your tongue right to Elizabeth Grayson which I don't know about that And oh Mark Grace Remember Charlie Gracie Grace land Anyway, she's been all over the place the interesting to you maybe five days ago as of April 25 she dismissed her agent was giving up acting in order to pursue her interest in creating visual arts He's earned a BFA was studying for an MFA.

Oh, excuse me for saying demographic because the people in the hero That no idea what that means Seriously you are Howard Cohen whoever you are at the Miami hero. Do you are the ultimate jackhole? That's what you are You're just your your shameless your beyond belief at least if you're gonna write something in the business section Many other section except the funny pages have some idea what you're writing about I bet you this guy don't even on a radio And the big story out of the softwater ratings yesterday the big story was big 106 taking a gigantic dump after Stern got taken off by cheap channel and he writes with a headline Big 106 not hurt by shock.com loss. It is unconscionable. It's idiotic. It's shameful. It's disgraceful That you people keep lying to the public first it was about the metro rail and then it's about something else Just lying in lying in poor max Castro you dump his ass because he told too much of the truth They heard all the like people who tell the truth. That's why they hate me like poison.

We here's the historian referring to in a business section of the my meat fish wrapper My me Harold the worst newspaper that pretends to be a major market newspaper in the history of the United States Is there any question about it? No peace of garbage And they have no shame. Who is it was at Jim the feeding that wrote that article several months ago when he basically said well Gee we used to be pretty good at the hero, but now we can't afford it anymore It would all these budget companies we really suck what you write on target about that Jim use suck Okay Business section my me Harold April 30 of 2004 a day that will live in infamy headline says big 106 not hurt by shocked jack laws Howard Cohen writes Big 106 is sudden replacement of the controversial the popular shocked jack Howard Stern Apparently had little impact on the radio stations most recent ratings In the three-month period ended March 31st the ranking of WB GG 105.9 a fam aka big one Oh six tell from 21st it's 20 second overall ratings in the demographic of 12 and above the latest arbitrum figures released Thursday show That's the only number he's gotten here that's accurate of course it doesn't mean anything because nobody cares about 12 plus But anyway he goes on to say and here. I mean if you're gonna lie don't just make up numbers you jack hole In morning drive time hours however when Stern's show error the station maintained at number 17 position Most of the tracking period included Stern show except for March will of course since it's only three months That's a third of the book March you idiot you jack old you The full effect is during the departure and late February will likely be felt in the next quarter's tracking period Superball fall out nobody could get a Jackson's Bear address swept stern off the oracle account communications on stations across the country including big one or six On February 25th the station's Foxrooms talk show for the hearing of off played classic rock cuts from lice of Led Zeppelin ACDC and pink Floyd then it goes on about CMQ FM did this and power 96 did that and about about a very briefly into that So we don't get a mention because we don't do 12 plus and nobody cares about 12 plus except Howard Cohen Let's go back to that one paragraph about where he says the station maintained at number 17 position in morning drive Well, let me just tell you right now Right in my hand not just because somebody called and made up a bunch of numbers, but here it is right from arbitron Okay Monday through Friday 6 to 10 a.m. persons 12 plus again in demo We really don't care about but nevertheless that's what he's talking about in the fall book WBGG had a 4.3 share They were number four Where he gets to 17 out of no because they would never number 17 either one 12 plus Sorry as he just picked a number and stuck with it Number four in a fall in the winter book. They went from a 4.3 down to a 2.7 from 4 to 18 In 12 plus a precipitous drop They're cum dropped 40,000 people their time spent listening drop 45 minutes But don't confuse Howard Cohen with those things because I'm sure he has got no idea what any that means now For this clown who says well didn't really affect him at all. Let's take a look okay Howard Cohen you idiot you embezzled you you lightweight you fed away you simpleton you goofball you You total absolute incompetent Do a little bit of homework is that possible? No, no, no He just he just the amount piece I guess for people you're just like we got very jackass the only difference is nobody reads very jackass With a brain just the sports nerds okay, but we already got them all locked up except the 33 are gonna be listening to Carl Foster In February well, let me just go back to the beginning of the year many team plus 6 to 10 am big 106 had a 7.1 share In February that's the Howard Stern show 6 to 10 all four hours February they had a 9.9 share in March without Howard Stern they had a 1.8 share oh my god 9.9 1.8 does anybody see this picture? Is anybody need a translator for me to interpret this picture for them okay boys and girls? I'm sorry didn't hear you the first time said dropping off the face of the earth from a 9.9 to a 1.8 Like that Different no Not hurt by shock jack laws you are seriously this again a major market newspaper not in some like hand out that they're handed out on street corners somewhere Not one of those rags where they just put a bunch of ads in their intro a couple of articles in like like the local local town reader whatever they call that crap And what is supposed to be a prestigious newspaper? Pumeless surprised when he mommy her while those days are long gone okay when in the speed joke You're at a disgrace Here's a fact that says I was listening to the today show this morning Katie Kurrick How tragic was interviewing two investigators about the American torture for wacky submitted though you saw those videos? I'm sure yeah, I did pretty disgusting. Oh, are they doing like having an orgy there? And then they go back to factory again It all of them always the case About the American torture for wacky civilians in the same prison of same allegedly with torturing the same people Traditionally we're pretty they're used to it There was bitching about we're breaking on their traditions. We want them to make feel uncomfortable One method of torture was we heard the pictures was attacking the wacky's naked in the shape of a pyramid Anybody who fell off or shocked with a thumb kind of apparatus thing Well, we can't tell you where they put the thumb because then jashled dump it Since we are torturing civilians have you seen the documented pictures? He's seen the scarf course We've all seen it. We're also handcuffing male civilians forced to wear women's underwear to sell bars right? We're degrading and humiliating it seven so on Now what is this what is this formal how congressman Jim traffic and what was that?

All right all right also done king Says how are you got it with all the on king five facts is about talking that kind of my fingers still stuck in a socket And I can't get it out that kind of look Anyway getting back to this article. This is just so grotesque and so pathetic And when the entire spring book comes out big one oh six is gonna like practically vanished from the facetia radio broadcast map in South Florida And whoever put the headline here obviously this this was an article with a purpose with an agenda Because I realized that the people are right the article don't write the headlines But whoever did write the headline there was definitely a message in here big one oh six not hurt by shock jack laws You should live so long okay? I think people ought to be canceling the hurled and drove today I'm not gonna renew it in fact for you know nobody being at home. I'm not gonna well we know it They can rod and hell I'll see the out grab one of the hills off the ground. They're that's sitting in front of you know those 15 20 minutes Around on the floor and nobody wants to read a grab one of those when I come in one there The idea that anybody would pay for a newspaper that just In accuracy would be one thing, but that just makes up a bunch of crap a bunch of lies That takes a great journalist like Max Castro off their op-and page because of the fact that he tells too much of the truth And because he doesn't fit in with their panoring agenda That's all they know about his panry who are they panoring do he in here? I guess cheap channel huh? They go to business will mimic a good match keep channel in the hurled I'd a disgrace an absolute industry disgrace There it is. I can't tell you what I just wiped with it.

It's uh orange. It's all kind of shades and colors. It's like a comedian piece. It's kind of like Moe's a little bit. You know, I mean, absolutely. Yeah Kind of like blackish around the edges and kind of comedian red. It's all over. Aaron Brown. Plus he sucks anyway. He's just awful. He's so minigree. He's they julie women of uh journalism of journalism Sinclair broadcast group is ordered at seven ABC stations not to broadcast Fridays nightline tonight. Oh my god. That will air the names and photos of more than 500 US troops killed in the Iraq war. In a statement online and I never even heard of the Sinclair group. I know it was a gas station. I never heard of it. Did you know that they had the TV stations? Uh no. They heard them. We have now. In a statement online the Sinclair group said the nightline program appears to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States and Iraq. Sinclair's decision announced yesterday they do a sharp response from ABC news. We respectfully disagree with Sinclair's decision to pre-app nightlines to be to America's fallen soldiers ABC news and the statement. The nightline broadcasts have an expression of respect with simply cease to monitor those of lay down their lives for this country. The show titled the Fallon will air at 1135 tonight in it newsman tech couple will read the names of the US troops killed in action while their pictures are shown to the viewers. As of yesterday 533 US are don't tell up uh poll wolf or it's to see there he's about 200 short. You see his testimony to they uh he thinks about 300 to die to even nobody's talking about he was just talking about this month. Oh as of yesterday 533 US troops have been killed in action in the US in the Iraq war and other tune and foredied from non-Hospital incident 737. Sinclair general counsel very favor confirmed the company told ABC affiliate's not to air tonight's nightline. We find it contrary to public interest he said. ABC said that on first anniversary of the 911 terrorist attacks that aired the names and produce of all those who dot on that day. ABC news will continue to report an all-fascist to the war in Iraq and the war on terrorism and men are consistent with the standards which ABC news has said for decades it said. Sinclair statements that ABC is politicizing the war. Now there was only supposed to show the good stuff that's going on not to fact that these dead people are given their lives right well whatever for whatever it is. A lie. Mr. Copeland nightline are hiding behind the so-called tributton and effort to highlight only one aspect of the war effort and then doing so try to influence public opinion against the military action in the market statement said. Here comes the real interesting part of this story. According to campaign finance records top executives at Sinclair given more than $8,000 to the Bush-Tainty Reel Action Campaign the executives haven't given any donations zero-zibity on not one penny to John Kerry or anybody else. Sinclair owns an operates programs or provides sales services to 62 stations in 39 markets according to its website. There ill anti-Kristo man. In addition to the ABC outlets in fairs TV group includes 20 Fox 19 WB 6U per how come they're not pitching about putting a foxes programming on the year. That's patriotic. That's fair and balanced journalism. Huh? It reaches approximately 24% of all U.S. television households according to the website. The groups ABC stations are in Pensacola and Tallahassee. St. Louis, Charleston West Virginia, Columbus, Asheville, Winston-Sailorn North Carolina and Springfield-Massage chusets. ABC News will show the tribute live on a Tsar TV screen in Times Square in New York. I think it's a nice thing that they're doing as long over to and what do we get? We get a bunch of Bush liickers, the Sinclair group. Oh, we're not gonna let you show that. We don't, and of course it's 1135 at night. So in other words, all the rest of the day when people are actually awake and watching TV, then we can put all the propaganda on there. You know, we can keep making excuses and kiss and kissing bushes in the Cheney's ashes. That's okay. What is this thing here now? Just this phone he does. Oh, this is cute. Ah, from Aintree, Joja. What? Isn't that amazing how people will take so much time to put on a bunch of crap? This is Reverend Jones. Is it love? Yeah. No speakers of America. You did a poll based on who's to be even, you can see it right at the top. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, it's so weak. So boring. So trying to be funny. See, want to go back to one to show over the years. It's one of the worst things. I mean, though, worst is people out there with their faxes, with their phone calls, who think they're real funny, real humorous, almost always they're not. You know what I mean? Kind of like you're a animal, same thing. Who people think they're real hoot and they're not. You're like him. 560, 70560. So there you go. Are we that just as another example of what else going on in his country and that is managed news? It's not bad enough that none of the networks give you the real news anyway. Not one of them. Has got the cones to really go nuts about this. Look at here's the new CNN poll. How's the Bush handling Iraq Disapprove 49% Approved 48%. April of last year, 76% Approved 21% Disapprove. What did difference a year, makes, huh? And 737 dead American bodies based on the lie. Oh, we don't want you to show that because it's bad for the Bush people. It's bad for the government. It's bad for businesses. It's bad for the propaganda war. It's what they're saying. An absolute discant. Talk about blatant than brazen, huh? Yeah. And then of course keep in mind when the CBS wanted to show the Reagan miniseries same thing. The right winger. I got ahead of the opposed. You, uh, you've done it. We don't have a whole lot of listening to show but we have some of them monitoring the program if you can't find your right. You've done it, man. You've got it. Lock stock and bagels. You just got your hands right on it and your squeezing real tight. Really messed up all their plans when Bubba got in here for eight years. Did it everything under the sun to try to get his ass out of there. They all day came dang close. It couldn't beat him in election fair and square even unfair because it wasn't close enough to fix it. So they had to try the impeachment process. The old stain blew shirt deal. penis gave. So now they're back in here again. Robis failed in wolfowitz and Richard Pearl and the old chaney, the old crowd of neocons, chicken hocks and they were doing this thing. And then that show on last night. Combined with that article we had yesterday about the Armageddon crowd. 33% of Republicans are in this Armageddon crowd. These born again fundamentals. Who can't just wait for that data becoming so we can get on that road arm again. These Israel lackeys not because of the fact they like to Jews that they really care about Israel because it's part of the prophecy baby for Armageddon. So that we can make enough for you. Can't refuse including the Jews then you're all going to go to hell anyway. Well we just and they talk about the Muslims being crazy with the 72 virgin and all of that crap. Jew will convert or die. I see. Sounds like an old story brought back again. And local. This is horrible. It's the moving. Everyone is talking about the controversial story of a final day of Donald Trump and his 12th episode, the passion of the Donald. People tonight somebody is going to betray you. The passion of the Donald triumphantly chronicles the last board meeting. All the rosette. You mean to tell me that you betrayed me for 30 pieces of silver. You could have easily gotten three times that much. All the rosette. You're fired. The passion of the Donald. He may be whipped but he's never defeated. I've always fantasized about you whipping me but if you're going to work for me you will have to hit a lot harder than that Katrina you fired. Don't miss the all inspiring conclusion of the passion of the Donald. When one blessed of a premise finally nailed down the job. Bill Kwame it's time to decide who goes up to the heavenly suite and who goes down to the street. But to find out you'll have to endure something far more painful than crucifixion. A two hour life finale. The passion of the Donald. If you don't see it. You fired. Did it. 1046 at 560 WQIM. 130th Kentucky Derby to Marla KY Derby's coming up. They've Johnson become 11 o'clock.

I'll get to that eventually. I wouldn't get to have said it about it. You know, you always see the picture on a front page and the big headline. Then you could read the inside. I see this pretty disappointing. You let us down. I think Maybe they're getting like the hero to think. You don't have anything juicy. They'll just make something up. Like hey, look at Big One06.

See if we can beat our old records in such. Yeah. Oh, I think we got a shot. As Jimmy would say.

Looks like he can. Yeah, kind of see what happens. All right. In fact, when most of them are in the morning, Mo was out here this morning. He got wind of his numbers from yesterday. And my do mean got wind in the most literal sense. And he's got what does that is he thought that maybe most of her little nausea after seeing those numbers? That's what does that. Okay. I don't want to create any kind of a problem there, but I'm just quote in what he told me. Did you hear him say it? Here what? nausea from seeing those weak morning numbers. I mean Howard Stern goes off the air. We go up two points. Afternoons go up to number one. They go up a full point. And our morning drive show goes down six tenths of a point. With the big competition there, with the big shot going off the air for a whole month. You would think they'd go zooming up there if we had anything going in a morning. But evidently we don't. WQAM Hello. Yes sir. Is this Neil? Sounds like me. Hi. I have somebody for the pull. Okay. Okay. Does it have to put a be a woman? Sure. Okay. Naomi Campbell.

Got only knows where that thing's been. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Town 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Tell me the QAM hello. Tell Neil how you doing. How about a grand grand grand from the Miami heat. You ever see that mop on his head? No. Pulled out of a mop bucket. Okay Brian Grant that sound like what he did me didn't it? Sure did. Yeah that sound like what he's doing put it on there or not. If you don't feel like put it on it's okay too because that was what he was a real jack hole. We can't stand him we'd have spies him like poison. And we don't care about the Miami freaking heat anywhere I'm going to show do we at all no even a little teeny tiny bit no care if they went like which they won't. But we don't care about them. WQAM hello. Denise Rodman is an magnificent choice thank you so much. I just pulled it out of the side specially. That is Rodman. She pulled him out of the fact machine will be a fact to tell you but now I don't have to. Well be sure and change the cartridge. With gloves. Very jackass big and a jack hole is very jackass right ready for a third all sports This is an article again ghost written by very jacks on behalf of Greg Reed our general manager QAM who puts all the heat he programs all the material that Barry writes in his column every Friday. They must have a little chat they get together and they have a chat room. And they sit down and in fact maybe the two of them I'll have a chat show mornings would be good because it's certainly being proven over what we got on there right now. Absolutely. At least in the early part of the morning. Ready for a third all sports station asks a very jackass and today's hero just filled with all kinds of crap. There are a few things we don't particularly need in South Florida. Yeah like your column Barry that would be a great start. More late afternoon rainstorms during the summer for example or higher gas prices. Or yes another sports talk radio station says Barry. Although nobody is clamoring for at local business man Carl 9 lives foster on Monday launches the markets third all sports AM radio campfest 14 every the fan. Unfortunately most of the fosters host have the same work recognition as your mailman. Nobody knows who the hell they are and nobody will either because nobody's going to be listening. And nobody's a private of South Florida gets a fourth all sports station in the next few months. ESPN radio which passed on doing business with foster is aggressively pursuing another outlet in the market. Or when speaking of 1400 the fan you do realize that that meant this morning was the last division of the current incarnation of the normally Kent show. Right. Watch this process. Because he was they were buying that hour for money or eight to nine or whatever so no more normally Kent on the radio. So you see the something that's been a commando that. It says ESPN declines to discuss foster but undoubtedly covet a stronger signal at Broward base 1400 which has spotty penetration in much of day. And much of Broward. Instead foster will use programming from sporting news radio also carried by WQM or not too happy but it and sports by line USA. Foster is buying airtime on 14 under the most of his expenses being covered by a marketing from that purchased 80% of foster's business people who buy airtime generally like to hear themselves on a radio and foster is no different right story. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha that's how's like a shot. He's going to have a former Miami Stingray's quarterback. I need to marks and James Brown from Fox NFL and Tom Alexander then nobody ever heard of and he no cost of from a Jacksonville nobody ever heard of and Arnie Spanier and Ronnie part of that nobody ever heard of and Arnie on a coast and peruses we've been this through this before 17 under the fan and it's a it we've been to this silliness before is what perists and if anybody knows silly. Only in the banana republic baby only in Miami tomorrow the 130th running of the Kentucky Derby now got a guy in the phone right now is called at least a hundred of them. I did. Did you? Do you regret it? I'm a little old but no I don't regret it. How about you Neil? How about you see? About 135. Dave Johnson is what is David the economy Derby to Marther is no derby unless Dave can call it so you're going to have to live forever I guess is what it is now you're even at the ask me which horse I like do you because I'm sitting here in Toronto and we got the Toronto connection. Smarty Jones. I like smarty Jones too. Oh no that's bad. Oh party. This is an incredible story I got a front page story from yesterday's National Post which is a horrible newspaper by the way I'm sure you know but anyway about it says murder injury and the terminal illness near fatal looming and all these things in her past can't keep smarty Jones from being on the feet and maybe win in the Derby. It's an incredible story in Stuart Elliott in New England, Jackie who's to be at Ilya every now and then in its dying days to be an overnight sensation. Do you think? Well I mean he's only you know what does that's often in the business for for uh I don't know we got it we got a cautioned Dave I mean we can say ask but let's not go a little bit beyond that because in the present climate since we talked to last will rapidly losing our ability to say about 90% of what we said in the past. You can all be okay then. Out of the new regime we have in Washington now we have to be very very cautious so you've reached your quote you could say ask once and now beyond your best behavior. Okay I'll be on my way. He's worth a very hard in the picture. Watch your ask. He's worth very hard in the business for 30 years and he'll be an overnight sensation. He's one 3000 races and uh this could be one more. I mean reading this story about how he smashed his head and the starting gate and I thought he was going to die and this is an unbelievable story. He's talking about the horse now not the jack. Not the jack you know he collapsed on controversy he reared in the gate smashing his head into an iron bar. Collapsed unconscious has had tucked between his four legs and his right eyeball driven into his skull with blood pouring from his nostrils. I mean this is amazing and I was undefeated. And uh he could he could easily get to the front probably halfway through and just uh just run away. Yeah you think? Well he was a very good two-year-old too. I mean he ran some numbers that were they they knew right away that this was a a freakish horse and I say that you know just like gruffian was a freak. This horse is just faster than his contemporaries. You know it's probably just as well with current climate that's going on and Bob backwards for us got the scratch mumbled in. Yeah because you know if he were to with one and you know what he what he what he does when he gets up there especially with you guys up back to the race he has a tendency to unleash if you uh exploded too so it's good that Bob's not in a race. I want a radio now Neil I don't do the TV anymore. Yeah you'd have to remind us we- haha I love radio. But we're delighted to have you on a radio because quite frankly radio is becoming an anaclanism very much left out of radio and I'm more so we're delighted to still have you. I love it. So who else do you like to hook smarty Jones up with him all day? Well how about the the great horse happened coming from behind you know at in the in the stretch show. I don't like you can say that. I don't think you say the name of that horse. Captain? Oh! Okay. Captain. That's all I was going to take. Okay. That might be nice. Well that's my my second choice. Who's your second choice? Because we will throw smarty Jones out and you and I have to have our side back here. No I'm going to pick uh imperialism can't a sormone. Oh I'm so sorry. haha. What do you say that? He's not fast enough. Okay. Well he could surprise you know all the surprises coming to Derby every year. They really could. So I'm hooking up smarty Jones with imperialism. I just think disormous good. All the way out. Ma'am who knows. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would be a lie if I say I followed you know real closely. But the smarty Jones story is very big up here in Canada. And since you agree and since he had such a great two-year old season he might be the one. Now if you watch any of the races in Florida there's a source we the footnote. So I just saw in television but E-Ren a couple big races down. Robby Elbarado. Is that it? Is that bad? No it's not bad it's good. Yeah. I mean if he did it before if we'd put no grand the big ones before we could go to noon I may I'll give you a chance you could probably pick there's a 19 horse fielder you could probably pick six or seven more if we're going here. haha. Well that's my trifecta though. Okay. Marty Jones, read the footnote. Okay. I got smarty Jones imperialism and I'll throw me to footnotes in there too just to make you feel better. Thank you Neil I've read it. Okay. Well listen have a great call to Ma'am as you always do. You may be pleased before let you go you'll be pleased to know our pull-through is about people with bad looking here in your close personal friendly. Howard Co. Sal is doing just fine. Hey I saw Hank Goldberg he said the thing to very well with the station and things are good. Things are fine things are from 10 from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. things are just going swimming well. Well now in the morning and the early morning hours you're good friend Mohour David who refers to this race by the way is the KY Derby I just thought I passed that along you. Mohour is having a few problems but they were trying to straighten him up. Okay. Have a great day tomorrow Dave will look forward and we'll talk to you at pre-pastime. That's the luck Neil talk to you at the pre-pastime. Take care. Dave Johnson. Trent Lot for the pull. What do you say? Absolutely. Says the Seagarld is here looks just like a helmet. So what did they say said tap it? I did you dump it or you tap it? I tap it twice. Oh, let's see Mr. Mark somebody wrote this says just wanted your listeners know you can catch a two minute video on the BBC website bbc.co.uk the children you wreck. He prism or abuse what phagor it says and so you are. Absolutely correct. Right on it. Amazing. 5 6 7 0 5 60 so how do you like that Dave Johnson I both like smarty Jones which is quite a story that horse. You really died. 5 6 7 0 5 60 let's take a call online 5 QA and hello.

Let's see you're sending me some interesting of blank practices and blank pages is pretty good. Yeah like two out of the last three pages I would say that's bizarre.

And this alleged Brazil trip, which was supposed to have happened a year ago in January, but didn't is something that they have really been focusing on where Frank Tyson and Vinnie and men were going to take this family out of the country. Frank Tyson told me on the phone he was planning on doing it, but only for three three three three. You see, when he changes lawyers like that, a midstream right here just before the arrangement.

Secret evidence that Kachakuin died at the court of the National Enquirer. Contensive briefcase all the grand jury needed. A briefcase containing pornography hidden away in Michael Jackson's bathroom was among the bombshell pieces of evidence that convinced Grand jurors to indict the pop star on child molestation charges the inquiry is learned exclusively. During a wait on Jackson's never land ranch last November police needed a loss meant to open the door to the master bedroom where the pornography was found. And prosecutors told the grand jury that the 45 year old superstar used the porn to arouse the now 14 year old boy who secures Jackson molesting him and playing him with booze nearly 2003. One of the key pieces of circumstantial evidence presented to the grand jury was a briefcase that Santa Barbara shares investigators found. During the search of Jackson's never land ranch is supposed to the top secret proceedings told the inquiry. It was hidden away in Jackson's bathroom and filled with portal magazines. It was established to the grand jury that this indeed belonged to Michael Jackson. Jackson allegedly used the pornography that he kept inside the briefcase to excite his young victim incredibly during the wait on Neverland. Police seized the blackler of the briefcase in the exact spot where the young victim had told police Jackson kept it. One of the magazines police confiscated was barely legal and adult magazine put up by hustler publisher Larry Flint, featuring adult women dressed in sexy young outfits to make them look like teenagers. Police believe Jackson showed that barely legal magazine to victim to excite him. Other items found in the master bathroom include a laptop computer store inside a locked closet and a digital camera. In the raid police also seized 16 computers at least 20 video tips and DVDs during the grand jury proceedings. It was revealed that the accuser and his younger brother, who wouldn't have some of the incidents, told police and psychologists stand cats. That Jackson used over the counter cold medicine and wine to knock out a molest of children. It wasn't mine with Jesus' juice. Let's write. Fresh with squeeze. Get it right. The boys also said Jackson watched TV naked in front of them and even fondled a mannequin in their presence. The boys also reportedly told their therapist the Jackson gave them a laptop computer so they could surf the internet for naked women. Among the witnesses who gave testimony to the grand jury during its 13-day inquiry with the accuser and his brother, his mother, psychologists, cats and the families attorneys, Larry Feldman and William Dickerman. I mean, William Feldman and testified that the alleged crimes took place that after they took place the Jackson came tried to intimidate the boy and his family with threats. The families belongings and even attempted to locate them to Brazil and inside a reveal. The inquarer learned that another potentially crucial witness did not testify before the grand jury. The boy who made claims about sexual molestation by Jackson 93 and got a $15 million buyout pay off. Hush money. The boy wants to testify only once and the prosecutors are saving him for the trial itself of the insider. They'll bring him out of a field they need to me as they were lucky to witness for them. The boy's uncle Raymond Chandler told the inquarer when he does appear in court it will finally give my nephew a chance to set the record straight. Michael would like to say that my nephew's charges were an extortion plot of fabrication, but the public doesn't know about the settlement which actions that my family was ready willing and able to assist the VA right up until that time until the price was right. By obtaining a grand jury and then against Jackson said of our registered attorney Tom Stendez able to proceed directly to trial without laying out his evidence in a public preliminary hearing. I subtracting his witnesses to cross examined by defense attorneys the trial could begin in December. It convicted Jackson who has maintained his innocence in spaces up to 20 years in a slimer. Oh, it's going to be a lot of fun in there, Michael. Oh, yeah. In the joint. Then on the bottom their patented cells on the back of the inquarer. New developments in Jackson case all had to acquire readers. Which is true. They've been doing a good job on us. Accuses mom is pregnant by the way. Yeah, requires learn exclusively that the mother of Jackson's accusers pregnant with father is army reserve major J Jackson 41 who took in the 35 year woman or three children last year.

McKinney should have followed our letter today to Mr. David Smith, President and CE. Oh, I'll sink there broadcast group and we sponsor the preemption of tonight's nightline program. He said I write a strongly protest your decision to instruct Singler's ABC affiliate Supreme Physifist's nightline program. I find deeply offensive Singler's objection to my lines and tension to broadcast the names and photographs of Americans who gave their lives and service to our country and Iraq. A support of the Presence decision to go to war in Iraq and remain a strong support of that decision, but every American has a responsibility to understand fully the terrible cost of war and the extraordinary sacrifices it requires of those brave men and women who volunteered to defend the rest of us. Last we ever forget or grow insensitive to how brave a decision it is for our government to order Americans into combat. It's a solemn responsibility of elected officials to accept responsibility for our decision and its consequences. And with those who disseminate the news to ensure that Americans are fully informed of those consequences, there is no valid reason for Singler to shirk its responsibility and when I assume a very misguided tent of prevent your viewers from completely appreciating the extraordinary sacrifices made on their behalf by American serving in Iraq. War is an awful but sometimes necessary business. You're deceived in the eye of your viewers and opportunity to be reminded of worst terrible cost and all their heartbreaking detail is a grossed service to the public and the men and women of the US armed forces. It is insured sir on patriotic. I hope it meets with public a program and it most certainly deserves. Good letter from John McCain. It's really interesting to me.

As a former POW, he's certainly has the right to be doing this to show everybody that he was a test career. It's not just a made for TV kind of event. You know it was all that until he got out spent. I'm here for a minute. McCain, remember those primaries when they $60 million they bury. Oh, you mean then? South Carolina where the old people smeared him and all of that. Other craft? Yeah.

Now, in an equally shocking development as the 10-year-old as the 10-year anniversary of Nicole's deathnears, family members believe very memories of her father's confession or surfacing and causing the ongoing feud between O.J. and Sidney to explode. We believe the reason for Sidney's frustration and her anger at her father's that she thinks she heard and make a confession about the killings of family source told the inquire. You following this? Of course I think I think I'm reading this in this week's inquire which is dated something, I don't even know where to hell with this. Something something and she thinks she may have heard it. Got it? Got it. At one point she thought she witnessed the murder, Sidney was prone to sleep walking when she was younger and may have stumbled down stairs while her brother Justin then five-slip and seen her father killing her mother. Because she was so traumatized she may have repressed her memory of the murder, but as Sidney's getting older some of these repressed memories are surfacing and now she remembers him on the phone admitting to the killings. Incredibly Sidney recently told pals about a phone conversation your father had after he was found not guilty in the criminal case of the family source. O.J. said, okay I did it. That's what under the bridge. So what the source reveals. Like maybe you moved along today? Right. Okay. I did it. The expert forensic psychiatrist, and did you like shoot a triple bogeon the 14th? Okay. I did it. The forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Neil S. K. was not treating Sidney says it's possible that she's repressed memories of ends pointing to her father's guilt. There are situations generally involving trauma where people repress her forget things. He said, but another forensic psychiatrist, Dr. Mohan Nyer, Nyer, said it may also be possible that Sidney has had these memories all along but only able to talk about the now because she's older. It is possible she heard her dad say these things and his health and said all these years and now feels safer speaking up because she's adults, Dr. Nyer, who's not treating Sidney. She's a crazy family member. I was believe that Sidney's memories are the reason that a relationship with the dad has deteriorated. After the killings, this is a picture of Sidney. She's a knockout. Yes, she is. She's a high school senior in Miami whose relationship with her father's described as icy cold. After the killing she became withdrawn, gained weight, bursted, and unpinatable rages that her father. Last year she even locked herself in a woman called police after he did argument with her dad and went too far at their Miami homes here at the end of night, loving call the Elamedo J. Your alusor. She heard at the end of the night loving call yelling, oh, she's heard. Your alusor. I thought maybe to go on the other end of the phone with Sidney. Now, Sidney, a high school senior in Miami who wants to become a child so I call it. This disorder, friends, you can't wait to get out of the house. The relationship between O.J. and his daughter is icy cold, send another family source. They sell them talk and they end up February. O.J. was in the Bahamas, then returned to Miami. They argued. Then a week later, before O.J. went to LA, the work on this proposed reality TV show, Juice, is the name of the show, the two had more words. Since the source, Sidney says he's cutting the knees till she's off to college, where she has more freedom and can begin her adult life. The co-sister, Nes Brounse, the Sidney, did over here her dad's confession, would have explained a lot. They don't get along very well. They tolerate each other at best. She told Inquire, although O.J. has never hit Sidney as quick a looses temper and frightens her sources say. For that reason they doubt the petty team will ever confront him about what she thinks she saw that either the murders or what she overheard him say on the phone. And of course, she sure hopes she won't read the Inquire. This is pretty weak, you know. This is lame. And then Juice Lair, Kardashian, died knowing the truth, is the whole thing in here about the interview, is wife. Yeah, Bob Kardashian. And she didn't say nothing. He didn't say nothing. And if you got real sick, her Kardashian, O.J. called and talked to her wanted to speak to Bobby was on a verge of death. He never spoke to O.J. again. I made the decision that he got when he called. I wasn't going to let him speak to him. Robert never even knew that Simpson had called. I felt it was the right decision. My husband was near death at the time. All those years ago, and by Simpson had never called. He never came to the funeral either and I was real bad about that. But you read this whole thing here in, uh, she knows anything. So it's much to do about nothing. The inquiries had like three, four issues in the world have been really, really weak. I mean, lame. And so they figured I got to put a blockbuster on a front there. We got Michael Jackson way, way back on the inside there. Way, way back to trying to get you to go through all the ads and buy from economic bracelets. And a few more naked pictures of Brittany and Ashden Kuji Kuji, Kutcher. But on the front page we got the O.J. You got to see the look on this face. His daughter's really cute. Yes, it. And she's cute. 5.6.7. O.J. I- Ha ha ha ha. 5.6. 7. O.J. Did it. That was great. Even a croak didn't do that. See, it says to a blitz blitz thing. It goes to show it. It's all that propaganda man. 5.6. 7. O.J. 60. I liked that one. How about you do? Man, that crow. He's now. Now, what is he on? He's got to be on this week. He got all this baseball crap going on. I mean, the marlins are hot. He's on 230 and 330 marbles for tomorrow and giant game. And a crow's on 230 just a quick half hour with a crow. That's all you need. He can get all his good shots in a half an hour before tomorrow and game on Sunday. I mean, you can say, How about you and the lead the probe, the lead the blow up. Okay. And a lot less than a half an hour. You said, whole bunch of times. 5.6.7.0.5.60. Pound 5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. So I may have just read that from the inquire, who may have just printed that thing. And somebody may have actually said that that they heard it. Got it? Maybe. Good. W.T.Q.A.M. Hello. W.T.Q.A.M. Hello. Deal. Yes, sir. Hey, Lanka. I was both over a year and a long time. Well, here you go. Here's your chance, man. Hey. Oh, I never got to talk to you about the F.A.

I mean, you know, it's one thing to be an intellectual and to be like an egghead and all these things. You know, all of these things. But it's another thing to be coma inducing. And that's what PBS is, which is why nobody watches. WDQAM. Hello. Ah, Neil. Except frontline last night. Yes, sir. How about Tony's second riddle? Tony's your redder's guy. I don't know. I don't think so. Forget that. You ever know what I'm saying about Tony's here? He's got conditioner in it. It's cool. Back. I don't want to know. Yeah. Get in touch with him. So to speak. 5.670. 5. 60. I think they're running dry. I think the list is pretty good. Well, you put it here. Huh? Since about 11.30. No, no, they're glad. And we got a few more coming on here. And I'm sure that there's some very obvious glaring ones that they've left off, which we could extend the hand of, you know, assistance there. But why now should we do that? We have to do everything for these people. There are no one. But all this great free entertainment. Don't forget to join Gellie. One last little promo for Gellie. Because he sure issued a survey.
