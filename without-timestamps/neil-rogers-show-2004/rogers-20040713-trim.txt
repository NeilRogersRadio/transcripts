As they say, I don't have any of the blue dig was stados. What a maggot infested cheese. Now what is that? Magin infested cheese. We didn't believe a lot of these things. So we had to verify them. I love cheese. There they are. With recipes and pictures and all that. George asked what's the grossest food that people actually eat. Blue dig was stados. Magin infested cheese to owe two. Are you telling me that all blue cheese is infested with maggots? No. That's not blue cheese. What is it? It's maggots cheese. Faggot cheese? Well, you'll talk about that. I'm sure. On maggot cheese, in other words, you're talking about something you came out of Josh Friedman's Pupic. Plus 10th or 180, although I understand it more like that. Absolutely. People, 148, very eating people. Or Booker burgers, one of the other. Rats 86, monkey brain 78, head cheese 61 to me. That would have been my vote. Oh God. Oh, I look at it. You know, when you walk into a deli and you see it in the counter. Yeah. All right. I mean, head cheese. A little plus something. I'm back in the name. I'm like, say something about that. But I'm over at a long dogs 48. By the way, my mother had my little dog killed when I lied to me about it for years. Skippy, poor Skippy. Rocky Mountain roasters 47. Balloons for lies duck eggs 46. You're filled to fish 42 and I lied to that kid on there. People called it in and I didn't want to put it on. And then somebody else called it and said, uh, stick it on there. We got a fact. If you're filled to fish is just whitefish. Dude, that's why it's whitefish. But I think there's nothing this pipe rams with. I thought it was 32. Viper year and soup 32. Although Josh Beckett is a, he's got a taste for it. Blood sausage 24 eyes 22 liver 22. Chitlins 18. Cow tongue 18. Well, what about just tongue in general? All right. 16. Tripe 15. Scraples seven and Vienna sausage six and why is Vienna sausage? I don't know. I argued with that guy. I love Vienna sausage. I could go for a can right now. Yeah. And what about, uh, what's the other stuff in the can? Stan. Right. Oh, right. That's it. I don't like it. Let's try it with cheese. Anyway, that was a full George Cook yesterday. But the one that I really want to talk about it. Great length. Maybe for a couple of hundred days is the one you took on a Friday. I was in here early on Friday. It's tapping out some stories for Eric and Josh there because I don't know. I guess because I was going away for the weekend in Niagara Falls. By the way, I've sitting at the falls view casino Niagara Falls outside in the parking lot area waiting for the bus. The coach handed a bus to bring me back after losing my ass. And I'm sitting there with a friend and all of a sudden, there's a car turning in a park in a lot of about 50 yards away. And a girl, I'd say like maybe 20. Sure. We need to go some pain. Six year old out the window says, isn't that the arraggers? And then before I could react by waving or give a flipping around for anything else. A way they went and I saw the Florida license tag and there they went. So yeah, that was me. What are the odds of that? I don't know. 50. No, seriously. What are the odds of that happening? First of all, what are the odds of my sitting out there waiting for a bus? And it was really a bizarre thing. It was a happening. But anyway, which game should we made into a post sports license? I'm looking on the pole that you're taking and I look at it and I thought, what is this all about? And so I opened a pot and listened for five minutes, which I never ever do. For five minutes and I'm going to tell you, George and Josh there were having a greatest time in their lives. And because the phones were ringing off the hook like we're giving away a hundred dollars, they're be caller. Yeah, unbelievable. Which game should we made into a post sport? And I will probably tell this audience that let's see. The only ones on here I've ever spent a bottle of course, Alderman Frisbee, Fuzball, Airhockey. Those are the only ones on here I think I've ever heard of in my life. I mean, knife chicken, guard the pin, how about guard the min pin? I'm Jewish and your neighborhood and all those stories that you tell. Bloody knuckles. Never had anybody to try. Full chicken, monkey bar fighting. You fox ball. You know those guns. Just never ball. No, I don't know these names. Pick the pin. Pick the pin. Please, touch the ball. The ball on a rope. Steer down contest. Burn ball. S. Burn what is that? They had to tell me about that one. King of the Hill. Thumb wrestling. Pistol fighting. Never heard of thumb. Paper football. Oh, this is a beautiful thing. So anyway, it was a tremendous response, George had it. I went right to the edge of my balcony and kind of played a jumping. I thought I'd have to knock. Why the hell about it? Why haven't we used the time? You know, with my luck, I'd probably catch my leg on the legend. You broke it. I've heard you say it. Yeah, that's what I always say. Anyway, we got some heavy-duty stuff on our website now. How about that boys and girls before we get into this? People who's a real f***er will in case anybody doesn't know that. And David Ross also was a real f***er, a cheats channel. Who are you? People kidding. Who are these people kidding anybody? No. Another one of these open up a pot and put a bunch of crap on. In fact, we've been taping the goddess on there. Wow! That tape's on here. From the day before. So it's going to be really timely, not. Oh, it just, it just makes my teeth ache. Thinking about what these people do, they got that 50,000 watt signal. And just in the middle of the night all of a sudden on Sunday night. Oh, we're a WI and Z again. Super stupid talk. Haven't we already been there once before? Several times before many incarnations of that, including Rick and Suds? Stupid talk. And we got Aramaica. Maybe we got Randy on tape in case you missed it that day before. We got Alfred and I can understand as about his exciting is listening to milk curdle in a glass. We got this Yahoo guy, Ed Schultz in the afternoon, who is on about six little tiny markets like Geneva, New York and Amor, Emerald Texas, places like that, that nobody ever heard of. And then we got more tapes of the goddess and then we got you in the grapple at night. Oh, what did he end with that? It just makes me sick to my stomach the whole I mean, if they would have put something good on there, we would have appreciated it. We would have liked it even though it might be competition, but this is just so lame. I mean, are you people crazy or what? Yeah, just keep struggling to that and of course whatever whoever they had on Fox Sports, which was a piece of crap anyway, but whoever they had on there, who was on live, forget about that. So keep channel continues syndicating every radio station in America. Everyone just open up a pot and put somebody on who didn't have any idea where you know anything that relates to your life, didn't know anything about it. It's just a tragic. Anyway, let's do the first poll today before we talk about the movies on our website and all of that good stuff. Who can he sell aka? Here's the first poll because the second one later is going to take a long time. I haven't even thought about the second one, but I think it's a good one to take. Maybe they had some of that blue uh, cause it could stand. Whatever Mitch could stand. Would the bush people try to postpone the election if they feared losing and who's the one guy who's been telling you for a long time that there might not be an election? There you go. How many months have I been saying that? You sure are funny. Bob Birdman. Yeah. If they get far enough behind, if nothing would surprise wouldn't put anything past this crowd, we'll see if you have any When the party ends with the ones people really try to postpone the election if they feared losing, Four choices. Yes, they'll do anything to stay in power. Why not? They stole the first election. Know they're too honest for that or no they'll win honestly. In other words, they don't have to do it. They don't have to postpone it because they're going to win any of us. Right, they leave anything off of their. Sounds like it. Sounds like a winner to me. And the second poll we're going to take starting at 11, and boy, I got a lot of crap here. A lot of heavy do-be-stuffing. including some important people died over the weekend What restaurant anywhere in the world outside of South Florida is the best? You know, I put outside of South Florida because we've done that a million times and we don't you know Plus it's that time of the year it's the middle of the summertime people are traveling maybe if they go to some place you've been They might want to check it out Right, right can you so stop and think about that as I Huh like Niagara Falls What does that mean? Like what what's a good restaurant Niagara Falls so when I go there to jump Oh for my lady for that poor brother that she was trying to jump and they wouldn't let her jump She probably had a bad day at the spot Maybe she had some frogs sit down next to her to machine she just got through playing a wooden for grand like I had happened to me. Oh, I'll brother You watch that video like a hundred times or so? No, I saw three or four times said it looked to you like the one of the fireman was smack in the crowd thought of her Pissues resisting them Yeah, okay Well, what's wrong with that? He was saving it.

Yeah, there is, yeah, I don't like Jefferson as much as you do But I do like him, you don't like the Jefferson's? I do like him, oh that is much as you do Why is that? It's just not as funny as I think you think Okay, whatever you say, and by the way for the Jefferson's fans So what your name is, is it Val Sanford? Florence, the maid? What about her name? Whatever, I don't know what the woman the actress, what her name is But she's about 100 years old now, and she's at Irma on passions the last couple of weeks She's making one of those cameyers like Ruth Busy, Lines here And we got at Irma on there, you slap you, drop you a heart, she's great Anyway, Jeff Smith, the White Bird administer, became public television's popular The first time I saw it, I saw it through the approval gourmet Before a sex scandal room, this career died on Friday, he was 65 Mr. Smith died in his sleep Wednesday, he had long suffered heart disease And had a vow replaced in 1981 In the 60s, Mr. Smith, a united Methodist minister Did you know that? Nope, I do know Before teaching course at the University of Puget Sound And to Colma titled, Food as Sacrament and Celebration Program and Local PBS Affiliate Cooking Fish Creatively And his career took off on the appearance on Phil Donahue's talk show The Frublegrour may became the nation's most watched cooking show It was a good show, you did watch it, I'm sure No, and a series that, no, the only reason I watched it Has he did a lot of shows in Italy? Oh, that's phenomenal, a lot of Italian food too And a series of a company couple of spro-cales workers for the category It was no Iron Chef, but in 1997, when a nine-five of the lawsuit legend had been sexually abused by Mr. Smith as Yutes Sixth said the abuse of court while they worked for him At the Chaplain's Pantry, a restaurant he operated in the coma In the 70s, if you can't get molested in the... Right, right, you molested in the pantry The seventh alleged Smith of youth after picking him up as a hitchhiker In 1992, he denied the allegations whenever charged A crime, y'all, y'all, and he's a... He survived by the way by his wife Patricia two sons He had a wife, you know? Yeah And then again, Isabelle Sanford, forget about the Frublegrourment Fuggot's some of the George even knows, like, you know, better than her She's more the queer Although Sherman Hemsley's on, I'm sure that's probably why you didn't like it Might he call him, but he was funny Actress Isabelle Sanford, best known as Weasy Louise Jefferson on the television sitcom The Jefferson's That Financial Consors Republics has said yesterday she was 86 That's old enough See, I don't have to worry about since I'd like that anymore Don't I think that's why my mother made it to 91 and then she You're kind of like departed because I always said, well, 90's old enough she I'm gonna show you a thing or two And she made it to 91 and bye-bye Does anybody want to hear more about the funeral? The only thing I will tell you is that I got to report did not go But I got to, and I'm glad I didn't go, just if for no other reason this part They still do the barbaric thing, I guess it's a Jew thing Where they lower the casket into the grime, and then everybody who's there Attending has to take the shovel and put a shovel full of dirt over the casket I mean, if that isn't sick, if that isn't barbaric and just gut-wrenching I guess the idea is to give you the most for your money, right? I guess, a little bit of a mystery and the most grief and the most Shrying and carrying on, I don't know, this should shave some Cost off of the funeral if you're doing it It's a matter of fact, another good reason that I wasn't there is if I would have taken a Shereville and gotten a shovel full of dirt, I would probably not have thrown it on the casket Because there were some people there, well Sanford died Friday at Seederside Medical Center Where she had been hospitalized since the 4th of July, her daughter Pamela Ruff was At her side, her health and weane after undergoing preventive surgery on a Nick artery 10 months ago, Sanford Coast Guard was Sherman Hemzley 75-85 10 years it was on and you don't like it Okay, I don't know, on the Jefferson's has been out for the proper Mysteries all in a family, well, I don't understand what is not like like it I think you've been reading too much Tom Zikolavit, you said all in a family Had the Jefferson's or the two best shows ever That's not what I said, I said time the top 5 or 10 Okay, that's my personal, that's my personal take along with flipper I'll put it in top 10 In 1981 Sanford became the first black woman Are we seeing any for the best actress in the comedy series for who work on a Jefferson's Isabel was our queen And that's what we called her on a show Said Maria Gibbs who all there Maria Gibbs is who's on passions this week Thank you who played the Jefferson's maid Florence Gibbs said that even before the hit sitcom Sanford's comedic talent's Reverend and during acting auditions This is about what come in and just light up the room and start telling stories Everybody would be in stitches, Gibbs said Sanford and Native New Yorker was joined by Jefferson's creator Norman Leard others in January when she received the star on a Hollywood walk of fame And I great that before she croaked they did something good for Nice going you go as about We haven't moved it all night I don't care what George says, I've achieved even Josh likes the Jefferson's Yes, pretty good Pretty good, see he's not going to go overboard He's going to be talking about Schmier the queer and the fuzball again no more On our beaten curtain today we got some heavy duty stuff man I'll tell you that we got not only Connie Salica Now we don't know what time that picture went up yesterday the Q and booby trap No, but it is the dog days of summer You can't even walk outside because of the smoke and the all out of the cramps Especially in Dave County So as a result we want to give you something to occupy your time Keep your busy keep your office streets keep got it trouble right It's a it's a pubic service.

There you go. And we also still have on here And I asked Josh he didn't have a clue. We got about three or four pictures that left over hold over from page Davis Huh page Davis. I guess the three or the three or four pictures that are there between the booby trap and the Rest-duty penis As a page Davis and there's a bunch of pictures where she's like playing grass and getting the doing ass to ask And then you go back to the booby trap and the movie mouse around again a little bit. There she is. Yeah, page Davis because the the inquire or one of those magazines had these pictures But you know how they put the the oops star over the top of the the part they don't want you to see So I found pictures without the star of scuring her butt.

This is what they've been talking about they've been dropping these hints after what's his name Not that what surprised me there was the I mean when you go to the lights they did to steal a first election in 2000 light. How wouldn't they do this now? And this and what it really is terrible. Let me just read this and what could be viewed as a desperation intent to hold on to the presidency the Bush administration is preparing plans to postpone the November presidential elections by claiming the threat of a terrorist attack would disrupt the process not an actual terrorist attack happening, but just the threat of it So I can just see on November 1st the day before supposed that the election here comes Tom Rijigan But at boring look on his push comes out and has a press conference to announce well We have some non-specific, but we think that maybe somebody open the mail and found some powder in it In fact, we're going to have the president check the powders Sources within the Department of Homeland Security confirm the agencies preparing legal steps to postpone the election and can do so at a moment's notice when the orders come from the White House Michael Isakov Newsweek magazine is also confirming this in this week's edition they're working on it they're getting ready The Department of Homeland Security has to justice to department last week to review what legal steps would be needed to delay the election The Department was asked review a letter for two rage from the forest from Jeff De Forest stories Sorry, who's the chairman of a new US election assistance commission The commission was created in 2002 to provide funds to the states that have replaced punch card voting systems and provide other assistance in conducting federal elections I hate to write the news to these people, but the executive branch doesn't have the authority to postpone the election only the Congress can do that are you were that I am now that's about the one thing even Of course it's the Republican controlled Congress, but it's the one thing you ought to keep in mind, okay, that might the well my causes to have an election WRA effects dropping sports roe Jim Sarny on Friday, I'm telling you that Jim Sarny what a nerd this guy is there any doubt Wow, what a piece of turd you are Jim if you took him and buried you.

You know, never let me see my thing cuz I already told you about this or anyway So my mother died a week ago yesterday, okay The next day the following day not because I thought about it not because I was depressed Amarost she was 91 like we're going to go through that old story The next day I lost my sugar craving. It just just went away. I've lost five pounds in a week without even trying And so I'm convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt That it was not physiological but psychological as in because she was smothering and Suffocating and just always somewhere in the middle of my work brain There was this thing about I don't know what you call it What do you call it some 40-and-thing some fruity and thing right there? It is some fruity and things In food and now it's just Navi she ain't there to nag and convention I lose some weight you're killing yourself That's all now. I don't have any sugar craving so it certainly was no physical thing Right Release my brain is cleaned out Nobody's probably your body. Oh, follow hopefully right there you go The sugar cravings are gone. I've had no ice cream no candy no no crap no no cake No pie no mother Hubbers pie no no no Tim Horton donuts not that stuff How do you like that and I'm not even interested I walk in the market and I walk past this stuff I used to be I walk past where the ice cream is I try to like have blinders.

Peter Lugger steak house 18 air mill seven rosewood grill five after that It's let's get some more names on or what do you say I We're not let's do some spots first I In local We're sports video five 60s You a M Another thing It was a me one of the big star My Yeah, whatever Oh, why hey you What a wife I want You Oh Oh In Oh In Why you why you I want to spend you That I know my smell of Tracchu Thank you But unlike that you You've still got your I feel just like And you are my In Murder And what you do with That's why you are so much Fine It's It's I'm going Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't Don't I'm On Show And You In Two I Can't Do I Don't Right That's enough I I want to hit that guy's I'm not sure Yeah Alive bromine Be I tried To Do you Drop Take in the dm4, okay, so it's stale stuff. There is nothing worse than stale stuff. It's like when I used to play the best and you'll crap all men if you had any idea how I hated that. Alien and the Pope, alien and the Pope, no matter what was going on in the world, I'm sitting there talking about alien and the Pope, right? And the fact that they're doing it or whatever was all about, oh god, and one stinkin' tissue and they can play an over and over again. And then we put George on there to give a change of pace, so we can talk about important things like Schmier the Quir, right? Now we're cooking. Let's put another thing. A lot of these facts as you sent me, I can't cut off at the bottom, the one about kissing my ass here about how I make you laugh. Okay, you got the original? Somewhere. What do you mean somewhere? Well, in the pile of, I've already factsed factses. Yeah, well, whip it out, let me find that one. What does it start with? It says Ray 940 Fox Sports like Air American WQA, which is the reason Tony Bruno and Jim Romar entertaining is they make you laugh, what a concept for a sports show. They discuss other things than sports and rip people at a servant. Other than you know what on WQA makes you laugh. They're all such boring drones that isn't between the 45 minutes and our spots. And that's where it ends. It can't read the next. Really? That's far as you got? Yeah, that's all that's cut off. The rest of it chopped off on my facts copy. Randy Rhodes on tape is there more and more annoying voice than that. Well, Goldie Tommy and the Big O come close. Well, wait a minute. What? I think that the Big O is rock solid. There's no question. If we have to do that one more time, see? I want to hold that up and oh, stop. Man. I mean, I like our rock lobster once in a while, but rock solid. Oh, Julie. We told her that he's head again. What solid? Oh, it says it's the same something here. And I can't read that. That's a sentence. So you must have missed something there. Wow, I'm going to refax it. There's like a whole bunch more. Oh, good. Then I'll read because if you start reading, then we're out of business. That's one good choice you made is not to like imitate because first of all, they hate you when I read the stories. And he said, he said, but if you do it, oh, brother, because you just, you can't read. No. Not mean you can read, but monotone, not or allowed. Anyway, here's the fact that this is I had heard or read a few weeks ago that Howard Stewart will be a monotone point one beginning Monday, July 12th. That was yesterday. I tuned in yesterday and heard nothing, but music. Do you know what's up? No. Anybody know what's up? Nope. Josh? No. Anybody out there? Why? We'll find out. No. I thought it was the 19th. I think it's next Monday, isn't it? The 19th is next Monday. Right. And I'd that's the day I think he starts on 103. Hey, well, promote everybody. We don't care. We're doing this fine. We're kicking ass. The checks keep coming in. They keep clearing all the time. That's all we care about. We're not sitting here pretending. Oh, gee. We don't want to talk about. We're going to promote the era of America. We don't care if you want to hear Randy on tape. Go ahead. If you want to hear Alfred, can put you to sleep. We like kicking a nice CES to after lunch. Man, the stuff I'm hearing about him. Not just from George. Oh, everybody in there, brother. Call my inducing. Pondrous. Freakin pondrous. Anyway, so that's the answer to that. I think it's next Monday. How would on another sorry or not, I went to the Marla game Friday. Even you saw it for a minute. You're sorry. Asshole. Stumbling around on the lower level. He was carrying around the same stupid ass. How sweet it is, sign. We're checking. He's picked you up on it. He's been carrying the game since about 1993. They were running Gilbert Solomon. Still walks among us. Oh, what tragedy? He walks around in the ball games with the Jackie Gleason picture house. Sweet it is. God. P.S., the Franken Show, couldn't be more boring. I'll give it about 10 minutes and bailed out. Excellent facts. Our Englishman and Miami says, Tallyho. He says, any public in lunch serves up better in fresher food than the crap over here. Now, I find that most amusing. Right. Because the brits are famous for crappy food, okay? Robert, Swill. Oh, brother. What does that meat pudding? What are they calling? Yeah, with on the pole on the gross foods. Oh, Jesus. Anyway, it says, if you need the name of the beef eater as many little cases in the UK, so put the beef eater in the UK, okay? If you make this limey bastard happy, he says, P.S., what happened to where the tiger guy never heard any follow up is he day? Well, the good news is, but in the rack of the street covering, the bad news is his boyfriend there. What was his name? Siga, Sigmund, Sigweed, they old or one of them. They kicked him out of something. They split up. They hit a fat. Okay, here's the rest of this law. You're right. Very long, Fest. It's the same boring callers. Why in complaining? Oh, yeah. It's the Shack Attack. Shack. Shack. Shack. Shack. What kind of a carpet do you like? Shack carpet? Yeah. But we do the drug concept spot. They do a great job. They do a check carpet. The same boring callers in wine. It says, it's in between the 45 minutes in our spots. I tried 14, I read less spots, no talent. Boring. I can still listen to Fox Sports on XM set and the internet. I try to America. I'm on the left by really don't need depressing political talk all day. I try to outfank in for five minutes. Boring. See there you go. Boring, man. You're boring. You're right good stuff. But you're not a broadcast number. You're too, you are freaking ponderous. Oh, I'm sure people are interested in it. Especially now we got Georgia on this summer. We're going to make some real big in roads on there. We're going to knock that bag it off the air. You know? No chance. No chance. This is Randy Rhodes on tip question mark. Is there a more annoying voice than that? He says, well, Goldie Tommy and the big come close. Don't be not going to big. Oh, he's rock solid. I got to have that tomorrow morning. I mean, not tomorrow morning. I can wait till Thursday. Right. It says, I didn't have George compared to Goldie. George is John Fesenda. John Fesenda to the NFL games. High-like games and the films for years and years. Great. Deep voice on the frozen thunder of Green Bay. Yeah. That crap. Okay. The bottom line is the. I bet you Josh knows John Fesenda. Never heard of it. You know, Harry Callis? Of course. Okay. He does. He does now because John Fesenda can't do it anyway. You want to know why John Fesenda isn't doing the NFL games anymore? Okay. He's going. That's it. There's a little clue for it. That's why he ain't doing it anymore. Harry Callis is so spastic. This guy's been doing the fully and the eagle games for about 100 years. And it's a, he's just, I can't even imitate him. We're just spastic, terrible. But he's the closest they could come to John Fesenda with a great booming voice. You've got to talk to some of your sports people around there. They'll tell you who John Fesenda is. Maybe they'll even play us some tapes. You know about broadcasting man. You better start getting with it. Hang around with that David and boring. No one of you don't know John Fesenda. Anyways, his bottom line is this. South Florida is a close society with no sense of humor to which I would say you are. Absolutely correct. It says, thank God I traveled 20 weeks a year. And thank God for me. I'm out of there about 45 weeks a year. A. Oh, Canada. Boy, I'm telling you. There ain't nothing like it. On my way to Atlanta today, where the people smile and speak English. Be in California and Vegas later this month. Looking graduation just keep traveling. Maybe that's my advice to all of you. People stuck in South Florida. Keep traveling. Keep taking trips. In fact, if you can't take a trip out of town, Georgia, I'll if you take a trip. He's got some good crap. Thank you. Oh, whatever. The barber shop this morning. Here's one that says for the poll, let Beck Finn in Philadelphia. Sounds like a frog place to me. Can you believe that frog sitting next to me at the casino when's for granted about 10 minutes on a machine? And I just moved my ass off the chair. Just moved it. I just, oh, Christ. Do you use the ball you're getting those daytime games when you're on? You spent it. Doing what? The day games that are on one on this show, the game's well, you wish. Those baseball games, so you get these short show as see. Look what we do as you all look. Look. Let me just say this to you. Okay. Next Thursday, I would rather work the whole four hour journey than I would rather gotten the foreground. Now that it's got to change my life. But just out of principle, I can't stand it with some obnoxious bastards, some frog with big humongous, boofle eyes, it's sitting next to me. And then he's bitching about the fact that I'm the one he got 25 out of bus. The other, the third matching one was done the line below the pay line, you know? Oh, gee, look, if I would have just had that 10 grand, you have to keep a new module piece of crap. Yeah. You want great for you ought to be kissing that machine. You ought to be kissing my ass that I moved it off the chair. You fat frog fart. Look at that. I said all those things and I didn't have to dump any of them. Because that I was thinking something else would be a little like the Dick Cheney word that it's not with enough. Yes. The Dick Cheney word, man. Anyway, what restaurant anywhere in the world outside Florida for us, we should change it or it is or was the best ever. Peter Lugerstake has New York 27. Airmills in Vegas nice choice.

See some people with some serious taste. The Spanish palace in all the ins and got three. The rapsity we got at Spelt right and the George has got the only vote. I would have voted for that if I thought of it. That was that was just outstanding. Probably too good was very good like flawless. Yeah fabulous. Really gourmets though. And all of the desserts there. Not that I am in the mood for them. But oh man. And that's why I had my first banana sposter man. Well, I think in a foster he would have been an azilla. I think we had that there too. Rapsity in Vegas said one. A beef eater's got one and that's it. That's our list so far. Well, it's Spanish is relaxed. Oh yeah, Rapsity was pre-moment. I was just fabulous. But I would say the crown of the tropical. Have you ever walked through the tropical where the he drove the parrots in the hallways there, and everything? It's a neat place. I like that. It's a little shaky. And one. It's a little one. She. She. Swishy. No. See, I was just about to talk about the slots again. No, one thing about the slots in the tropical. Yeah. They're either. They're kind like some of the brawl. They're either really loose or very very tight. Yeah. Nothing in the day. No, no.

See we sure might say I'm the only one. Yeah, yeah. It's the 12, 3, 5, 60, W, we got another death. But you're not going to know who this is. I'll give you a little clue. How's that? Well, Carl Perkins is already dead, not Chuck Berry. There's all this. Elvis is dead. Legendary Clevelandist, doc. He built Randall who was instrumental in producing out. When you listen, you might learn something now. Besides, a fuzball and a shweer of the queer, coupsball. Now, what is smear of the queer? What is it? They changed the name because of a political and corruptness. Yeah, we like that smear of the queer. Now, discuss this with Joe in his day. They called it, kill the man with the ball. Like somebody would have the ball and then everyone would try to tackle that guy. So he'd be in the end of that point or throw it away. And it would just run around like, it's a field game. It's a field game? Well, no, you play it, maybe. Legendary Clevelandist, doc. He built Randall who was instrumental in introducing Elvis Presley to the American music scene. As died of the age of 81, says WRMR AM. They said his last show was in pre-recorded was broadcast Sunday along with a memorial program. Randall is credited with bringing Presley to American radio. And over the years, he up the careers of dozens of other stars including Tony Bennett. What a shame. Bobby Duren, Rosemary Clooney, come out of my home. Johnny Ray speaking over a fae and fat stomano. My favorite right, fat stomano to the fat want man and Juan Fath stomano. Great. Nobody don't like fat stomano. I bet you Josh don't know who fat stomano is. Sure, you do. He knows him as a notorious B.I.G. Randall arranged in 1955 Cleveland performance for Presley with Headliner's Pat Boone in the box and Bill Haley in the comments. The two concerts only, probably, second gig in the North became part of Rocklore because they were filmed for Universal Shorttitled, the Pied Piper of Cleveland which was about Randall. How do you like that? Doesn't say, yeah, he was 81. If you can't go for a red, but you're falling at police, police, fell off all. So maybe he and Elvis are hanging out together in that big, big control room in the sky. Here's a big and a control room. Here's a fact that points out. Maybe the other person that facts before that couldn't hear Howard was in Dave County. I didn't notice. Because in Dave County 103.1 is a top 40 station in Tavre near in the keys. You can't pick up the 103.1. The buzz from my Palm Beach isn't it? The buzz is a mess. Josh, that's the buzz. The buzz. You can't get a buzz in there. Dave County. Against the law. I'll assure a lot of smoke out there. Maybe that's what all that smoke is from. Here's the right back. Here's a facts from Judy who says, Good morning, just wanted to let you know. I sent you to the tropical candidate with your friend over 10 years ago. Thank you, Judy. Your favorite restaurant is gone. I knew that. The new one is proper candidates called Pietrose, but it's still the same chef. So I bet it's still outstanding. I didn't know that. Thank you, Judy. She's going to hook us up as well. Thank you, Judy. You're the best. Love you. By the way, a push with my husband. I'm moving to Canada. Can't blame you. Oh, and you know something I haven't talked about? That. Because it's my first opportunity. Wait, I'm sure you talked about it at length in between a football and Schmerley Scharzer. Did you realize surprise? No. You haven't talked about that? Which one? About finding Osama or else? Oh, well, everybody's talking about that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I didn't bring it up. It's just out there. When you mean you didn't bring it up. But it's been talked about. I'm just unbelievable. I mean, how can anybody vote for these grave robbers? Assuming we have an election, which we might not? I mean, they're telling the, they're telling the, I shot Mochera for over there in Pakistan. They're telling him, hey, they're Osama by a before the election. There are no F-16s, baby. We're going to make you know for you can't refuse. And then we're going to turn around and say, Yamama, we're out of food finish with that. We rather say Osama, but if he forces to say, Yamama will say it. And then incredible or what? No, very credible. Wow. I got a whole story. It's on our website with new Republic Pakistan for bush July surprise, question mark. Late last month President Bush lost his greatest advantage in his bid for re-election of poll conducted by ABC News of the Washington Post discovered the Challenger John Kerry was running even. I'm a critical question of whom voters trust to handle a war on terrorism. This spring, the administration significantly increased its pressure on Pakistan to kill or capture Osama bin Laden, his deputy, Eman Alza Wahiri, or the Taliban's Moor Omar, Moorullah Omar, all of whom are believed to be hiding in the lawless tribalaries of Pakistan. Kind likely lawless tribal areas of date county. A succession of high-level American officials from outgoing CIA director George Tenet to Secretary of State Colin Powell to assist in Secretary of State Christine Arraqa to state Department counterterrorism chief co-for black to top CIA's South Asia official have visited Pakistan in recent urge prison, perfect, mature government to do more and the war on terrorism. In April, Zalne Khalilza, the American ambassador, all these names are the same to me. American ambassador to Afghanistan publicly tried to the Pakistanis for providing a sanctuary for al-Qaeda and Taliban forces crossing the Afghan border. The problem hasn't been solved needs to be solved as soon as the better he said. The public pressure would be appropriate even in the law to have had it not been accompanied by an unsimely private assistance in assistance that the Pakistanis deliver these high-value targets HVTs before Americans go to the polls in November. So maybe we put these two stories together. You see? If we can postpone the election in November even a few weeks, it gives us more time for their good buddies over there and maybe some of our undercover people to be looking for Osama Yamama. We must find Osama before anybody's allowed to vote. Okay? The Bush administration denies its gear to war on terrorism to the electoral calendar and the two nations have been the same since September 11, in terms of getting a high-value targets off the street and that doesn't change because of an election. The security council spokesman Sean McCormick bought. There's a big butt, back them. But the new republic is learned that Pakistanis security officials have been told they must produce HVTs by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful inter-services intelligence, the ISI, the Pakistani government is really desperate once the flush out been lodged and went and outlets flush them out. And as associates, after the latest pressures from the US administration to deliver before the upcoming elections. Introducing target dates for Al-Qaeda captures as a new twist. In US Pakistani counterterrorism relations to coordinate recently, a departed intelligence official. No time tables were discussed in 2002 or 2003, but the November election apparently is bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt. Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security explains the Musheref government as a history of rescuing the Bush administration. Now they want Musheref to bail them out when they're facing hard times in the upcoming elections. Oh, a third source who works on the ISI's director informed the new republic that the Pakistanis have been told at every level that the apprehension or killing of HVTs before the election is an absolute must. The last 10 days of July, deadline has been given repeatedly by visitors to Islamabad and during meetings in Washington. I'm aware of no such comments as McCormack. He don't know not, you know? He didn't know no Godfather. And it goes on about how Paul did not commit the US to selling F-16 to the Pakistan, which had desperately wanted to tilt the regional balance of power against India. And Pakistanis fear that if they don't produce an HVT, they won't get the F-16s. Equally, they fear that if they don't deliver either Bush-ray prospective curb administration would turn its attention to the apparel of Pakistan's security establishment and facilitating their illicit proliferation network. One Pakistani General recently, Washington confided in a journalist if we don't find these guys by the election, they're going to stick this whole nuclear must up our f***hole. How do you like that? He said, right up our f***hole, meaning, right to him, right? Stick it right up our ass. And a public suspect, and why isn't the media screaming about this? Why are the Democrats screaming and curing on like crazy about it? Oh my God! What kind of a bunch of whips have we got? We don't have a two-party system. We got a no-party system. The party's over, baby. Oh, by the way, what's your name? It'll work at the Cox anymore? What's your name? You're a good friend, Cheryl. Oh, she doesn't? Thanks for the message, Cheryl.

Now let's see for our pull. Let's get some names on his pull. I got a few more here for you. Here is one. I wish I could change my vote. The Prince spaghetti house in Boston. Oh. Now you're going to say, well, how great could it be? I could put that place in Alan. Alan, great could it be. I went from the place in Rome on it, but I don't know the real name of it. I'm always raving about by the Starmuch of a whole hotel. Oh, my mummy. Is that it? It's so good you could cry. My mummy! But the Prince spaghetti house in fact, what are they? What was it? Two-tier Wednesday is Prince spaghetti day. The same. Who is the one? Whatever in Boston. And if there were Prince spaghetti houses, it was a shame. All over the city. A man. They had like 60 different kinds of pizza. I mean, of spaghetti. With the sausage with meatballs, with this, whatever. It was fabulous. That's right, gained all my weight. That's why I got fed as a cow. So anyway, let's add that on. And also, we got a couple more. And you're right. You're right, Rick. I'm so sorry. I apologize. I got to have that clip also Thursday morning. Okay. Along with. Right. Well, that thing is a panic, isn't it? Wow. I never thought I'd laugh at anything he said.

Well, you know, when you're only on two days a week during these summer months, we don't have that much of a chance to ramble and just to rip everybody in ads. I've got some things like that. Wow, what? Somebody QA in. Hello. Yeah, burnt steakhouse, baby. Good one. How could I forget, man? I apologize again. Vroom steakhouse in Tampa. That's not South Florida. Where do they want to say South Florida? We're talking about date, bro. I'm probably South Florida. Yeah. Vroom, now you've been there, have it you? No. No. No. Holy moly. And now he's dead. Burnlacks, you know, that's because he died early because I said a million dollars worth of business over many years when I was in W. snooze and I won. I've never forget that time I went there and met him and he gave me the tour of the place and said, well, I never tried to repay a kindness with all the kindness, but accept my best wishes. In other words, he was still going to charge me for the freaking me. And back in those days, I wasn't making a big box. You know, a nice free meal at the burn steakhouse. Would have been a nice, nice gesture on his part, you know? That would have been cheap pasture, but now he's dead. But anyway, now they also got this big dessert room upstairs and it's different from when I was there. And you pay by the pound. You pay by the weight of the steak. Oh, that was the steak. All right. No, not by your weight. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That boy walks in there. They put him on that meat scale. That'll be $4,000 for dinner, Mr. Ruffman. Yeah. That's a good idea, though. That is a good idea to be in fact, they should do that. I'm going to be free. And courage, you too. Yeah. That's a great idea. Oh, but there's a Sunday brunch that I go to every week with a friend we've been going for a long time here. And if you could see there's one guy comes in there. How he sits in one chair. How he puts that huge, large ass in one chair just beats the crap out of me. He did just enormous. And he comes back from this, I don't know how many tips he makes to the buffet. Not third man on the brunch, but he comes back and I'm his plate. He's got piled up all of his bread. Okay. Do you know what I mean? I mean, I guess he goes there to like keep up his bulk or something. I don't know what that's all about. The good thing about his heft. It's kind of disgusting. Any buffet you go to, like our friends at the Amel Coast, you can go there in the food is great, but you'll see some of the customers there. Any brunch or buffet. There's always a bunch of huge, quirky people there, load them. Just what they need. I can't begin to tell you what a difference is. I don't want to sound corny or over emphasize this. I just have, I just lost my desire for all that cram. It did just went away. Maybe because you're so depressed. Yeah, that must be it. Can't you tell? That's right. You can't eat your sober, you've got to try it. But like PD Lenny said, thanks for the card, PD Lenny. He's the only one on the staff present or pasted Senate card. Thank you. Thanks for the flowers Greg, even though you're out of town. PD Lenny sent a nice crisis. He hopes that I find peace.

I'll take your word for it. Oh, it's the 14th, but it's the 14th of June. Nice going there, Troy. You idiot. Oh, brother. We got a sales staff or what, huh? They put the the Troy.

She's just a staggy old pool is what he has. 1233 27 to one and five sixty WCM. That's good news here for you. Statewide poll released on Friday shows. He wrote in support for President Bush among Cuban Americans. And could open the door for Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry to make inroads in that community. According to the Latino think take the connected to the survey. You know there was the Latino think tank? I do know. The poll done by the William C. Velázquez Institute probably came to Jorge Velázquez in his son, the John and the Mirror Ram group. MIR. R.A.M. The Mirror Ram group has in Kushmir and Taukes. A New York based survey research firm found that 66% of Cuban American registered eligible voters in Florida support Bush. That's down from the estimated 82% who voted for Bush in 2007 on Toneau Gonzalez president of the Institute. He'll present anything. There was alarm going off. A danger signal for the president Gonzalez said this is a very important constituency for him. 82% down to 66. Oh my God. Because Bush won the 2000 election by 537 votes alleged in Florida. Any decline in support by Cuban Americans traditionally largely Republican extremist voting based is seen by many as they threat to his reelection effort, which is why they want to postpone a election. They'll do anything. Maybe they'll be like paying their pants anything they can do to postpone it. Until we can find Osama or somebody who looks just like him. The findings echoed those who are appointed earlier this year by FIU and partnership with the soft floor to Sunson on WTVJ Channel 6. Is that NBC 6? Okay. I hate when they do that. Can't stand that. That survey showed that 58.4% of Cuban Americans in Dayton, Broward County said they definitely are probably would vote for Bush. That's under 60%. Totally in Moly. Gonzalez said the Kerry campaign could woo away a significant number of Cuban Americans. But the poll results showed that even if Bush lost about a third of Cuban Americans supporters, those supporters are not necessarily in a Kerry campaign only 16% of those pulled supported Kerry, but nevertheless, if they stay home, right? It's Bush and going to get in. They're going to have to like fabricate with a bunch of dead people voting. Most of those pulled were registered voters and the rest were eligible to vote. All of his bonnet's were from Florida. The majority from Dave County, somewhere from Tom Beats and Hillsborough counties. The poll was conducted by the Cuban American Commission for Family Rights and Organization that opposes the Bush administrations newly implemented travel restrictions on Cuban Americans, which only allows Cubans to travel Cuba once or three years, and reduce the list of relatives on the island that they can get government permission to visit. Most of those pulled said they approved the new restrictions with 50% saying they strongly approve among those who disapprove about, but third man said they strongly disapprove. Alvaro Fernandez, president of the Commission, said most registered Cuban American voters are older exiles who tend to prefer a tough stance on Cuba. Fernandez said his group aims to register new or Cuban American rivals who are more likely to travel to the island. How do you like that? No, my, no, my, no, my Bush.

That's why this country is filled with some of the most disgusting obese people on the globe. Certainly no obese British men are there. Like that wine's. That's why I'm Churchill for example. Now, most of the British people are skinny and pasty and looked like they just went through Auschwitz, like the Dutch. And as for George's Port yesterday, you should have put chicken on there. If the people in this country knew what was in the chicken, they eat. I hear a tea with a top to list. Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken all the time. It's easier. Do you really believe there's enough chickens to be this overweight country? Know that chickens are pumped full of chemicals and crap and fed fates of feces to fattin them up. Lovely. Should have put that on your pool. Then served to us. Ask yourself this why why are females in this country sort of helpless such an early age? Not like that in Europe. You see girls over here getting their periods when they're eight and walking around like a fully grown woman by the time they're 12. To which everybody in America says. Oh, right. What's that to like? It's very sad that there's nothing that can be done. But if you're ever in England, go to the beef eat or have a nice English supper and you'll change your mind. First of all, will I ever be in England? No. There's about as much chance of my visiting England as there is in my visiting Israel. On a scale of zero minus infinity. Okay, I give it a big point. Yeah. It's slightly safer in England. Oh yeah. Of course, thank goodness that their meat supply, that their food supplies nice and safe like with that mad cow. Yeah. You can check it over in English cow any day. Yeah, or someone who's other delicacies that you people eat over there like that spotted dick and all that other crap and the bangers in mash. Oh, God. Fish and chips and tot in your whole. Oh, brother. Even Richard gear gets up so when he hears about that. Maybe you know why. But they have those bug eyes. Like they got it sat down to man and the casino next to me the other day. Oh, man. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60, not the A. I mean, America, I don't care what anybody says. I haven't been in Asia so I can't talk about there. But of the places I've been there a lot of things in America to criticize. But of the places that I've been and I've been a few quite a few countries. America's got the best variety of food anywhere. Sure. The best choices. There's no plan in our tied in food certainly. It leaves much much better than no question. But you're not going to get a great stake in Italy. I haven't found any or not that I wanted it. But I'm just saying that's not their bag. That's not their thing. If you want to tie in food you go to Italy for the best. But as far as a country that's got phenomenal Chinese food and any at the group you name, Dutch German, right? Right? Because we got them all over here. Right. So don't be a sour crowd. Okay, my British friend and tot high and whatever. Which up? 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon. And how's that man calcum in by the way, huh? In fact, I think one of those summers was about three years ago. That was an Amsterdam for the whole summer. Remember that? Yeah. When you're wife pulled that summer surprise? Yep. Or maybe that was the July surprise that article was about. But anyway, that was when they had the big man calthing and everybody even in Holland was panicking because the abrits are right there across the North Sea. Well, please don't let any of that nasty British meat in here. I can vouch for that. WQAM, hello? Hey. Yes sir. How you doing? Pretty good. How you doing? Okay. Listen. Yeah. It's time to print the bushes. Yeah, okay. Great. 560, 560. What was that Billy Shears? 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Line 9's ringing WQAM, hello. How you doing Neil? Pretty good. Hey, best restaurant I think is probably greened off and in. That's in Cape Alutra. And I think. It's somewhat? Cape Alutra. It's a sunny island. Cape Alutra. Alutra. Oh, Alutra, okay. Yeah. It's Alutra. Probably the other one's got to be Domonico's in New Orleans. Okay. And we can't really cork these out. Alright, excellent. Thank you so much. Time to zoom. Hey, might not hire him David Ross. At least to put a little humor there on your day 940 on your stupid talk. Alutra. Yeah. You got it? Okay. Wait till I see how he spells that. I think it works my back. ELUTHRA isn't it? I don't know. I'm good at spelling, man. I am good at spelling. I'm good at spelling. I'm good at spelling. Oh, boy. Peter Luger's steak house in New York. His number one, the best restaurant outside of South Florida all-time prison past. Is or was, right? That Eric Man, he is, uh, is better. All the terrible things you say about him. I think, I like I'm just just drop some little hit in the man. He is right on it. It's a laborer of love, man. Peter Luger's steak house is when it hands down. Man, I wish, of course we got all these New Yorkers, you know. Now Josh said he was in New York. Where do you see? He went to some skanky club. Scores. Oh, no, good club. That's right, because we're going to be doing spots for them. So we got to say it's a really great place. I thought you went to some skanky place. Like club 54, which I'm sure is long out of business. Scores. Right, did you score? Yeah. No. Well, I went to, well, what's the point then? Because there is a lot of sex in the champagne room. Oh, damn it. What a bad break. Oh, and you didn't get to Peter Luger's well as only about how many thousand Ray restaurants in New York? I'm 30, man. Say what you will. Just like I said about the US. Say what you will about New York. So man, there are restaurants there. And I haven't been there in a long time. I have no desire to go there because if I want to see a lot of Jews, I can go to a sunrise. But it's just amazing that number of Ray restaurants. So I'm sure you didn't get to Peter Luger's and plus it's the way out of your budget anyway. 46 for Peter Luger is what I great stake saw us. Burns stake house in Tampa 19. You see Burns move up the list from nowhere. Oh, it's great place. It's fabulous. Now see, you should go over there. Yeah. You're going to take your whole family over there to Burns and let Greg buy a nice dinner. It's a leestie can do for you for all this hard work you do in all summer long. What are you laughing about? Or just take your girlfriend over there to get the family. And we'll send Vegas 17. Rosewood, Grill and Vegas 15. Commanders, Palace and Noilines 15. No boo in New York has got 12. What is that? We know that. Yeah, it's owned by one of the iron chefs. Isn't it a Japanese? Yes, it is. Well, sounds like it to me. Well, I mean, what kind of people do you think? I mean, what kind of people eat the Japanese food like, like, Reg Reed? So I'm saying it to me. You like Japanese food? I don't know why you hate the Japanese. What did they ever do to me? I don't hate the one that I ever say that. They can put it to their food and you've never had any. Yeah. Well, I like the brits, which I do hate most of them. I have had their food in its garbage. The Japanese, I don't know, probably then they're very obedient civilized people. And they just goose step right along as to many of the food is. And of course, the Chinese that's, wow. Did you see the thing that on the, on all the, Oh, man, all the rip off stuff, those Chinese, you've got to watch out. We're going to be our undoing. You think? Yeah. You think? Lime in the Virgin Islands 9. We got 400,000 Chinese people here in Toronto. You don't mess with our Chinese friends. All right. Nothing could be fine of them to see your body on Spadina. But anyway, Lebeckfin and Philly 8. Befeiter when you case six. See, there's six post for you. Limey Bastard leave Malone. Prince, we're getting house in Boston five. Oh, this is so great. Chin Tiki Detroit five. The Coral Gables in Michigan. I mean, couldn't you put East Lansing in Michigan? Jesus, a judge? Like you don't know from East Lansing? Three. Perhaps any of Vegas two.

Post associated with some of it in Cali. Al Harbi surrenders to the Saudi security officials in Tehran. They're schlepping around in a wheelchair. Cali Paul Harvey. They can't fight Osama. They said he'll do. Page two. Exactly. So there you go. I don't see on the there's a big red thing breaking news on the CNN website. I don't see on the budget report yet, Miss Fudge. You better get your finger out of your uh... Back to get with him. Of course he ain't listening right now to watch anyway. He's probably under with the old the Frankenfire. Bad news for all of us dog lovers. Greece to gas 15 thousand dogs before the Olympics. No matter what old saying, I'll be aware of geeks bearing gifts. Right? Experts in fact uh... what they used to say, Greece beware of Greeks bearing back them. Experts fear up to 15 thousand straight dogs will be poisoned before next month's Athens Olympic. So the city looks pristine. Well, isn't that lovely? Remember that we'll be with John Stockwell pristine about that car? Right. Authorities in the Greek capital fear the son of Pax roaming the street will damage the country's British show its modern and civilized. Yeah. We're really modern and civilized. We just gas all the animals out there. Maybe if we have any street people will gas them too. Greek animal welfare groups say slaughter of the city's estimated 15,000 Strasis started 80 dogs have been found dead in Sardonia. I'm sorry. Sardonia is uh... the Tadiano. Uh... Sardonia is a coastal resort where members of the British team are expected to stay. Sardini excuse me. Be the Spiachi. One animal welfare activist said there's been a big increase in poison. Things we expected to rise sharply in poisonings. David Bowles of the RSPCA International has been helping to train Greek officials to catch and treat Strasium mainly. He said we're seriously concerned that thousands of dogs will be poisoned so Greece can show Athens as a pristine modern city. It would be our barbaric and sobbing. Yeah pristine and modern. Even though it's things like crazy there and it's filthy and filthy as hell. And nobody with a brain goes there. The only people who go to Greece are the islands. Meconos. Places like that. You what? I said that's where all the uh... Ma decoines go. You can not see anything on that uh... on that uh... The Fudry for yet. That is embarrassing to me that CNN will be like a half hour ahead of her. Wow. Talk about the Don is slipping. Okay. Maybe this is Fudges slip. I'm seeing on there right now. 560. 560. The best restaurant of all time outside of South Florida. President passed. Povity QA in hello. Yes sir. Yeah. May I speak to me? Speaking. New? New? Yes. Uh... I had uh... First the best um... restaurant in Europe. And then uh... Uh...

Five six seven. Oh, five thought it was a lady and it was on a little kid. Well, it's uh... kids are out of school now. Right? Yeah. Kids are out of school. I got to have something to do. We certainly want to make very sure that none of you kids out there go to neo-rodges.com If you're not at least 18 and have several pieces of ID, don't even think about. Clicking that thing on there under right under John Askcrofts. And look at all them booby pictures because God only knows the punishment you're going to updo in hell. You could bet your life on it. Five six seven. Oh, five sixty. The Philippines are bailing out by the way they came in over that truck driver. You know the hostage that they're going to be hit. And it said, oh no, please, please, please. Pretty pleased and they okay. So I guess they're going to let him go that uh... whatever his name is. What's every, don't know what his name is. The truck driver. Flip. Yeah. Flipy. There's a lot of flippies here, man. There's a lot of everything here. This is an amazing place. You just uh... we would be lost. You wouldn't know what whether his scream read a banana. I'd uh... he both. WCWM hello. Not there. Not don't like that sound. WCWM hello. That can't really, right? You suck. That can't really, right? It was like that. He's practicing for the sports shows. All right? Just relax. Jack and Jack and Jack and Jack in the big shack attack. And yeah. Really terminal really pondress. Although I'd said, tell one thing, be good pulled for tomorrow, who's got a bigger head, shack or your rose. WCWM hello. Not there. QAM hello. Is this George? Yes.

It's George Eddie. Okay. It's off of Ohio in downtown Chicago. Gee, Neil might have heard of it. Great, great, great old Italian steakhouse. All right. Thanks a lot, George. Keep up the good work. We'll do. I'm thinking of myself, you know, because everything seems to, don't forget to tell me what that guy said. What? About Gene's in George Eddie. Oh yeah. Hey George. Don't be interrupting what I just had a brainstorm. I'm thinking of myself if these people were smart, what they would do is they get a whole enormous can because even though he may ask me that, well, I'm thinking is that if I'm going to continue this deal, another like maybe three, four, five, six years, I think maybe like during the summer two days a week we're extended like maybe June July and August. And during the rest of the year, like Monday, Wednesday and Friday, we like just flip flop. Okay. Don't you think that's a good idea? Sure. I think that's a good idea of me going back every day five days. I don't think that's going to happen. Can I get paid? Well, of course. I'll let them take a chunk out of whatever their paying me. I've got a few extra bucks in here somewhere. You see what I'm saying? I think that's a great idea. A record course luckily is out of town, so he won't be here in that. On the other hand, probably is here. Oh, gee, who you say, you know? Oh, my God. Because naturally he's trying to feather his own ass because he knows that I walk out the door for last time. He's asked, I'll be right behind me. I'll be looking over my shoulder. Trust me when I tell you. I'll be having a rear view mirror clip to my cat. So that's something to think about, Dup, okay, and clearance. Something to be deponged or get yourself secured for another couple of years. Because I could handle like two, three days a week. That's fine. Doing this crap every day. I think, no, no, it's just you got to be a lunatic. Would you agree? Oh, no question. You have to be a meanie. Well, I mean, especially, you know, I had that thing with a table in there. I had that collision with my dining room table. We were like two colliding forces here. Then it was like having a car accident. Right. And I still have like, you know, I must have like a minor concussion or something. They still have like, uh, and it's going to take me weeks. Right. Maybe that's why you don't remember any of those games we were talking about. What? 12 minutes after one at 5. 60 WQAM. Hey, you're on the right station for games. Baby, it's all the game. Oh, real good. People can be a way to. That's right. How about a little Schmier the queer? Hey, when you're here, looks like somebody smear you bad. You know who I'm talking about? Absolutely. Yeah. If you look really like a clown, here's the answer for you. Charles Alfieri has been doing it right for guys for more than 35 years. He's been on Good Morning America.

Think, if conventional sleep issues with settings like gentle rain and bathing brook don't help. Get the John Kerry sleep machine. It laws you to sleep with the mind numbing sounds of a John Kerry political speech. I used to toss and turn for hours, but now I just turn on my John Kerry sleep machine. I International Strategy is centered on an arc of light. And before I know it, I'm surprised to be here. The John Kerry sleep machine offers four different policy settings to suit every mood from text reform. My new payroll tax credit was yours. And getting so sleepy. We're going to die today. To the economy. Before we can lay the foundations of economic pursuit. As a complete foundation. Get the John Kerry sleep machine today. And with any luck, you'll sleep right through the election. I'm John Kerry. And I approve the John Kerry sleep machine. Available where only I sleep machine approved by John Kerry. Let me say something. One 18 is five to please do on the speaking of Schmere the queer. That's a Bush administration's favorite game now. Isn't that all the other stuff that's going on in the world? And what are they bringing up this week? Constitutional Amendment to band game area. Oh, right. Good timing. Right. You fake it to get nippity. There you go. Saudis and how is it that CNN got this on their website? Miss Fudge put a link on there, but this is going anywhere. You must be in progress. He must have heard me a bitch in about. I was going mad. You're really slipping your old age sweetheart. Probably got that big hat on too tight. But he's also got a gigantic hand. Joe Rose, a shack and misdraged. Who's got the biggest heid? Want to get them all together? There you go. I don't think Joe wants any part of a misdraged. Maybe shack. Saudis have been lawden aid surrenders. Across the social media about cutlet or salami mom who didn't lot with flown from Iran to Saudi Arabia all day. After surrender, the security officials of the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Khaled Al-Aharbi, they show him here in his wheelchair, just smoking on in there. Was believe we've been living here in the Afghan Iranian border. Video aired by the Orberg television network Al-Arabia, two days ago. Al-Aharbi, whatever the Harvey, Paul Harvey being carried from a plane in place in the wheelchair. Al-Aharbi's believed we'll fall with bin Laden against Russian forces in Afghanistan about 20 years ago, Saudi officials believe in return to Afghanistan in the 1990s. Joena Pudal Kada. In late 2001 he was identified on a video tape conversing with bin Laden about the 9.0 news of the surrender comes after a Saudi amnesty offer in late June for Al-Qaeda fighters to surrender with a naman. And Robert Waxler was on a CNN about a half an hour ago, just ripping the Saudis and Bush and asked, nice going, Bobby Waxler, you go boy. How about Bobby Waxler, for President Damit? He's great, you know? He's good? Yes, he is. Outstanding. He's also trying to make sure that your vote might count as a lesson if we have an election. A couple of votes, I don't have time not going to read all this boring stuff. Electronic voting critics sued, doubled under whistleblower, law on San Francisco. Critics of electronic voting are suing, doubled in, under a whistleblower, law of the company's body, building equipment, exposed California elections to hackers and software bugs. California's attorney general on the lawsuit Friday was filed in November, but sealed under a provision that keeps our actions secret until the government decides whether the joint of plaintiffs law makers from Maryland, the California are expressing doubts about the integrity of paperless vote internals made by several large manufacturers, which up to 50 million Americans will use in November. How do you like that? And Florida's relatively new touchscreen voting machines targeted as a solution of the state's 2000 presidential election meltdown didn't perform as well as the machines that use an order technology during a statewide election earlier this year, according to an analization by the Sun Sentinel. Records from the March 9 Democratic presidential primary show that votes were not recorded for one out of 100 voters using new ATM-style machines. That sounds like 1% to me, I could be wrong. That's at least eight times more than number of flawed votes cash in the same lesson with Pistol Mars on paper ballads, touted by an optical scanner. Experts blame Florida's political leaders for embracing the relatively sophisticated touchscreen machine before they were perfected and made more user friendly. Fifteen Florida counties now use touchscreen machines, including Palm Beach, date and and... I'd be like that. What I have bought these men in December 2001, Broward chose a 17.2 million-dollar touchscreen system over a pencil and paper system press no more than five million earlier that year and made Palm Beach County, Greedepay 14 million for touchscreen compared to three million for the simpler system. What I have bought them, no Broward election supervisor Brenda Snight said about the touchscreen's. We started a supervisor after the machines were used. Were we too fast? Yes. In fact, who will... What have been the election supervisor in date County and Broward rather during that time? Who's on trial right now? Maryam? Yeah, there you go. You go, girl. Far away. Speaking of girls, here's a facemconic Rick who's just, I mean, just... I think, get a life Rick. I have no life. Your good friend Lynn Samuel says blasting your website on serious for all the girl look at the page Davis and be the curtain. Maybe she's got the hospital page Davis, partly. Or maybe she's on our booby page. I did. Also, it says Mr. C's has one vote. And he knows the connectively as well. Well, that's good. Thanks for reminding me of that Rick would just to get a life. Your Omaha's got great food. I'm telling you Omaha's a place that would really surprise you. You'd be shocked. What restaurant any in the world outside of South Florida is or was the best where you had the best meal, it just was like orgasmic and then some. 278 votes. There are 220 votes. Very few votes because most people have written these places, right? Right. And plus I'm babbling and babbling andcessantly. That's okay. I'm enjoying it. Peter Lugherstake has New York 52. Burns Stake has in Tampa's kitchen up close 45, which I'm sure. And I might have a chance in winning because it's so much closer, right? Right. You got to go there. So take Josh over there this weekend. Not this weekend. The next weekend. All right. Commanders Palace in New Orleans, 20. Well, I mean Hank was always taking his producers out to lunch.

That Cobi V. is supposed to be the best. He's on trial. V. F. E. 11. Lyman Virgin Islands 10. Lebeck Finn Philadelphia 10. Chinticky Detroit 6. I'm amazed that many people remember. That is, in fact, he just went to seven. As I said that. Prince spaghetti house in Boston 6. Two days spaghetti day or as a Wednesday. Prince spaghetti day? Wednesday. What's the answer? I don't know that. Ericsson. Well, how does he know? Apparently, he knows. Well, I think with Eric every day is spaghetti day. O'Donnells in Maryland 5. Rapsity in Vegas. Rapsity is got three. Crowle Gables in East Lansing 3. And Eric didn't change that. For Michigan to East Lansing, please. I'm so embarrassed that just as Michigan. Because that letter that when you say Michigan, people think of an arbor right away. The University of Michigan because mad dogs always talking them with Michigan. Oh, right. Fair. He, uh, an arbor's for glam. Mr. season. Omaha's got two now. Rills and man. Hoover's got a pair. Ross's stay cast in Omaha too. The green dolphin and a couple of three. One. Gene and Georgia.

Oh, I mean, you know, it's been a few minutes. Every single day, even on the days when Georgia's doing the show, I'm, what do you think of that idea, mind? I think we really should pursue that. Yeah.

I'm an old, dottering fool man. I don't want to wind up in a box like, like, ma, well, maybe 91 would be, okay.

And thanks to the rabbi who never, even met my mother, but obviously was the nice bright. I didn't hear it. I was there. Yeah. Well, first of all, why did we, why did we have to have like a Jewish funeral? She was as Jewish as I am. You know, it was a, it was a, a dietary thing. That's true. I remember the funerals are for the living. So therefore, yeah, they're going to have a cat. So that's why they got to put that, they have to be put through that excruciating thing, is shoveling a shovel full of dirt on the casket. And I thought that the years ago, they stopped lowering the casket into the ground. I thought that they just let the deer on that lift and then everybody walked away. And that's how they did it in our family, but we're not Jewish. Well, that's how you're supposed to do it. It's civilized. I mean, when people go crazy is when they drop that thing into the ground. It's like the final eye. I don't know. That's when they start losing the coffin climbers. Like quasi-moroid mean. Hey, if you're on the Ankeens diet, South Beach sugarbusters are it.

I don't watch the work and I don't even just think about it. But just think about it. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Come here. I'm going to crush you and then look into the window. One, thirty three mad dog get to a clock. You as military not a rake is behind the topic of the statue. I had that on our website last week. Did you talk about that? No. Nobody knew that because in one of the books that I was recommending. I can't remember which one because after you read 40 books of the same stuff. You got all blends together. And remember I talked about Christian. I'm on board just happy to be there with her. See an end crew when I was going on. Just can we conveniently happen to be in that spot. That's a quink. Right. I always book a was it was the, Let me go to the home page. It said paperback. Okay. No, I can't even think of the names of the name. We're just one moment please in Ontario. It was. Not that one. Yeah. Spitting on the access of evil. There you go. By Scott Taylor. Anyway, US military not a wreck is behind the topic of the statue. In other words, there's no more conjecture about it. This was in the LA Times last Monday. We go yesterday. The US Army's internal study that were in Iraq criticizes some efforts by its own Siyah units, but one spur of the moment effort last year produced the most memorable image of the invasion. As the Iraqi regime was collapsing at April 9, US Marines converged on fertile square and central Baghdad, set up an enormous statue of Siyah Hussein. It was a Marine Colonel not Jewish Iraqi civilians, as was widely assumed from the TV images, who decided to topple the statue of the army reports. And it was a quick thinking army Siyah obtained that made it appear to be a spontaneous, Iraqi undertaking. After the Colonel was not named in the reports selected the statue was a target of opportunity, the Siyah obtained used loudspeakers to encourage Iraqi civilians to assist, according to an account by a Siyah team member. But Marines had ripped an American flag over the statue's face. God bless them, but we were thinking from Siyah school that this was just bad news. The Siyah member wrote in the report. We didn't want to look like an occupation force in some of the Iraqis we're saying. No, we want an Iraqi flag. Somebody produced an Iraqi flag in a Siyah surging quickly replaced the American flag. Ultimately, a Marine recovery vehicle toppled the statue with a chain, but the effort appeared to be Iraqi inspired because the Siyah team managed to pack the vehicle with cheering Iraqi children. How do you like that? All right. What you see is not what you get. Usually. Just put that. Of course, there was CNN going right along with a, oh, carry 48 bush 45% in Michigan's real close in Michigan. Two close when you say, for comfort. I would settle more like for 98 to two points with some, but I would say, yeah, me. Government intervention, not just a better diet and daily exercise is needed to combat obesity. Public health advocates and government officials say yesterday, I do want to say one thing. All right. And I know it's going to sound, well, 100 things. It's going to sound very insensitive. You see, you know what they don't understand? It isn't, it isn't the method. In other words, there is one of us who's been fat for many years who doesn't know how to lose weight. Right. And what not to eat? It's doing it. It's how to be able to do it. That's what they ought to be centering on more is the mental aspect of the whole, like this thing with me. Or I just, just all of a sudden, lost my whole sugar craving. You just disappeared. Once I got the monkey off my back. I mean, once I had that tragedy in my family, see how it works. Once you get over your grief, you'll be back at it. No, no more crap for me. You know, the crap is what makes you fat. Even the late restaurant reviewer Peter Clayton, I used to tell him if you just quit eating so much crap. You'd be in better shape and he just wouldn't do it now. He's dead. Remember Peter Clayton? Nope. I've told you about him. Poor from you, yeah. He ate a lot of crap. With about 400,000. And you know, that's attributed to obesity. Speakers that they roll obesity cumbersome. I said, come on. I can't stop thinking about that. That's disgusting. A combined effort from the food pharmaceutical and healthcare in this reason, conjunction with the federal government is needed to shed society's extra pounds. If we don't do something, we'll have a horrendous problem on our hands, said US Food and Drug Administration can make your lesser Crawford. Their relation to Keith Crawford drives once in a while in Michigan. 64% of the US population is over way to rogue bees. 64%! Not right. How do you like that? Public advocates of the, well, I, British guy was right. Because the idea is, poopercise it, poopercise it and make it bigger. And even at super talk, everything has got to be bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and not better. You wait till you see the numbers they're going to put out. Man, you're going to need to mount Palomar telescope to see those. I call it David Ross and PD Bulger, you idiots, you morons. I'll say it again. We all know how to lose it. How to do it? That's another story. Follow what I'm saying? What are you saying? Quit eating a crap. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Like doing today's show. Sam, I'm talking about all these great restaurants, great meals we've had. And it is making me the slightest bit hungry. I, the other hand, and so is Josh. Yes. We're hollowing over here. Yeah. So I didn't order some food when Zach worked that one week. There was food coming in there. What was that one place, Josh? The joint. The joint. We had the joint. I've been working on them for a long time and they won't respond. Yeah. Well, it's like they're not there when Josh calls him. Maybe they're avoiding him. I don't understand what that means. I'm missing something. I was like, like during the, you're, your whole week vacation. I kept telling Josh to call them. Apparently our contact isn't there or is never there. Well, then how come they send food in when Josh and Zach were there. Maybe they don't like you. Maybe. Maybe Zach has the connection. If it's involved with food, Zach's got it. And I don't care what any of you say. I've been thinking about it for at least 10 seconds. He has he has some kind of a a vocal problem because of that weight. He can barely speak. He just, he just makes sense. Wouldn't be the food. You're in your responses. You've got a husky voice. He's got a husky body. Not a husky voice. And as a result, he can barely speak. Like that. It's a lot of weight on his head. Exactly. There you go. We want somebody that's rock solid. We don't want somebody to talk like that. Rock solid. That is. Just when he got, Man, he gives me the willys. They he be. He's not even Jewish. Brother. Funny till 2 at 5. 60 WQM duek up every morning in a crowded bed. I only wish.

None of those interlopers who didn't belong there showed up there which is very nice. Also kind of bizarre that I didn't for all the flailing and gnashing. I'd regret we did send the biggest bunch of flowers there to the funeral which was nice. But I didn't have one sympathy card from anybody who works inside of our building. Now some people you know made a comment came in and said something they out across the line here like before to show now. That was sufficient. But it seemed to me that if there was such concern and such gnashing and carrying on, just like I didn't talk about that it would be nice to simply be card with suffice. I mean what I get a sympathy card from PD Lenny Knowless who works at 850 up there in Palm Beach for that Tashmendric up there. Whatever his name is Steve Lappa. He's just another Lappa dog up there.

Because I did read it. I don't know what they always. Let's see. This is the day. But I'm going to just do this couple of paragraphs again. Because a lot of people didn't hear this. This is devastating. Vice President Dick Chini faces criminal indictments for illegal activities. While CE, a vendor G-Gian, however, and also illegally intervenes to cure a $7 billion No-Bid contract for his former employer after his election to office. The Vice President is currently under investigation by first authorities for bribery, money laundering, and misuse of corporate assets while at Halleburton. Also faces a U.S. Security's new change commission probaby. $180 million dollars slush fund that may have been used to pay bribs. Those who have read the analysis say it presents a devastating case against the Vice President concludes that Chini is violated both the spirit and intent of federal laws on conflict of interest. Even worse, Chini faces indictment by a French court on charges of bribery. Money laundering, misuse of corporate assets, because of fraud.
