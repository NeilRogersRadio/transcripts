There's Lady of Time. She's a Mother Dark's Jew. And she needs to buy bread that is unleavened. And she buying reddit seven. He lay them them. And the bread is unleavened. And the bread is unleavened. And the bread is healing unleavened. And the bread is unleavened. Making peace is hard to do. Don't take your rules. I'll end from me. How about to town south of Galilee. Leave us afraid that you still hate Jews. Because making peace is hard to do. I know that we, we used to fight. I need your help, baby. I'll have time. What you ever, even just want to. How about to run back and go to? It's true, you're not that weak. No, what more can I change? My own people is to answer my head. This is what you got. I will pray that I might end up in front. And once it comes, I'll never die. We will get this fun. But I was shaking hands with rain all the time. Let's get a beating again, and I'm in the bottom of the crew. Because making peace is hard to do. I can't beat pork, you're smunk. I can't beat it. Let's roast the pig for a piece. What do you say? Okay. Or let's roast the beast. Same difference. 10 or 3 and 5 and 60, WQAM. Well, boy, I tend to, this is going to be some week. Make no mistake about it. You know, can't you smell it already? See, and just another force I have. And I said, can't you smell it already? Are we still going to have 360 there? And instead of getting what I wanted to get. More on that. We're got absolutely. Bad news to get started. We don't want to do that. 10 US troops killed in Iraqi violence. 10 more, but of course, as somebody we know would say, it's worth it. George is on vacation this week. So I haven't anybody to say it's worth it. Come on, say it. It's worth it. There you go. You don't say it enthusiastically enough though. Sorry. Supporters of an anti. I can barely hear you. Are you like under the table? I'm right here. Supporters of an anti-American terror-created in four Iraqi cities. Yesterday killing 80 US troops in one Salvador and soldier in the worst on rest. The spasm of looting and arson immediately after the fall of Sodom. The US military yesterday reported also two Marines killed in the separate enemy action and bar province. Raising the total of American service members killed in Iraq to release 610 and the carnage just continues, but it's so well worth it. And Bush is still making a joke. I've been looking for those weapon-device destruction. And now Colin Paul says, all of the CIA gave me some of them information. No. You know, but those mobile labs and all those chemical weapons. And all those maps that he had there for the win and the road map to peace and all of these things. All of these things. All just what? He got some bum information. So another finger pointing is going hot and heavy. Got a lot of very embarrassing stuff this week, but does make any difference because it's a holiday. Kids are all out of school for a rum. Let's see. And you'll ever notice how the Jews in the Goiom always have holidays that like the major holidays overlap, so nobody gets left out. Well, Christmas and Christmas of Hanukkah. Same time, right? Yeah. Same concept. Give presents. Good gifts. Good for commerce. Easter and Pace-off. Right? Right? Always right about the same time. Sure. You got your good Friday. Come up this Friday. You got Pace-off starts tonight. Right? It's on down. You got it. So there you go. Don't need no bread. I'll think that right now you're going to burn in hell. Make no mistake about it. I got my wheat mothsa. Do you really? Yeah. You're still going to burn in hell anyway. Natasha Kinski. Now do you know her? Are you familiar with her? No. Should I tell her who it is? I have no idea who she is. You're out of the loop band. Anyway, she's actually pretty old. She's 45, born January 24, 1959 in Berlin. And she's a model. She was all kinds of movies. Who the hell is who she is? She's on our thing today. You had to be there for your over the age of 75. And you have 14 pieces of ID and lettuce from her great grandparents. Maybe you can take a quick peek at it until John Askcroft catches you with your hands below the table. She's got very tiny boobies, by the way. Am I a opinion? Could I be wrong? She was in paradise. Found all around the town. She all kinds of TV movies and nothing really made you know. She's more her model than like a major actress. Natasha Kinski is there. They just read it. Perusing you is whatever you want to do. Now I got some bad news. Or actually it's good news. I think. That I finally wise up. I got tired of being a fool. Amor on. Amor on. All these years. The fundraiser that we were going to do. And I'm going to say again that we were going to do. I want to first thank even Greg Reed popped in the 500 bucks which for him was like a major miracle. And the mufflands he contributed and Rick Shaw called in which was very nice. Thanks anyway Rick. But nobody's going to get charged because luckily Eric had like a kind of a permonition. That we might be following you to a bucket of stuff. And so he didn't deposit any of the credit card the contribution. I wonder why Miguel was asking me now you didn't donate any money. No. So somebody worried about it. I wasn't worried. Yeah you were. Okay I was worried. You were going to get into a bucket of stuff and we'd have them all. All the people called Miguel by the way if you're confused about this. We'll be able to number a little bit later. Call him up in promotions. They will anyway. Yeah. But we're just in deposit and the contributions. Quite frankly there was not much in the first place. Like over the weekend. I think we had about how many more dollars. About 30 men. Yeah. So and of course Scott and New York and these probably listen right now. How many how many thousand scots do you think are in New York City? About 30 men. I would say it to very least. We don't have this guy's last name. When Eric offered the extended hand a friendship. I mean this is just one little radio show in one little market. We're not syndicated. We're not reaching anybody. You know how many people we got on the internet? About 30 men. Just keep pumping that thing. They like it. So I mean what are we going to accomplish on this one radio station? Why the hell should we be the conduit for trying to like drum this stuff? I did this 17 18 years ago. I didn't learn my lesson. I got burned then and I would get burned to get now. And I'm not going to take people's money in good conscience. Not that there was actually pouring in. But I'm not going to take a dime for anybody. And then find out that though it is guy. Doesn't we who knows what the story is with this guy. But it comes back to Eric with a line like, well, I got more right at the moment. I got more signatures than you people have money. Well, what is that? What kind of a line is that? That's his response? Yes. He's got more signatures than we got money. Is there is if somehow we're in competition with him? I wasted the last three weeks of the show with his stop at CC dot com. I was going to accomplish something being the more on that I am. And right. And look, this industry deserves whatever it gets because like I said last Friday and this is the truth. The broadcast industry blows. It's full of the most scourly, the most spinyless people. No back goal whatsoever. And whatever the FCC tells him jump this high. They'll say, well, how about if I jump a little bit higher just to make sure. Just like our weak need pansies, we got running around the recue way. I'm old. I think I heard something there. I think it's a lot though. I don't want mention any names. You know. Was that. Yeah, I don't want mention no names. Duffing clearance, but nevertheless. I think we better have a better bleed. You know. Yeah, we need a better bleed. That's a new deal now. The search for a better bleed. How about this one? Yeah, that's a little bit louder. Yeah, yeah. So I'm just not going to do it. I appreciate the people that did want to help out. And there weren't really that many of them. But that's figures anyway. You're not going to raise money. Now the thing that where you tell me before the show about was the beast. Where you told me about the Orlando. But what? The fact that they were there was at Miguel tell me about how they were calling into raise money to send him to the, you know, you told me. Yeah, yeah, there was like back just after the NFL combine. Orlando's. NFL combine. Are you ready for that? The big ol goes on the air. He pays for his own trip out there, which was what a child he is. So we can go on the air and give all that big information on his sports and her dub session. And the audience is calling it. No, where we want to donate the money Orlando to send you out there because we should have to pay for your own way. And they're sending him checks, which of course he couldn't accept and had a send him back. But for that, they'll send in their money. But for the first amendment for freedom of speech for whatever they want to hear on a radio, watch on TV. Oh, we can't be bothered with that. That's so when they take away when they take away in a few months, all the shows you want to see on cable, when MTV starts playing the path boom records all day long, don't be blind. I mean, don't, don't look at the rest of us. We gave an opportunity. Nobody really cares. Nobody gives a crack. A lot of us we have the games, man. That's right. That's how we care about on QM is ball games. Okay. We got the big Marlon over which we're in the like static. I have, well, I'll be a big Marlon fan again. Any day that they're playing a day game that starts before 2 o'clock. I say, let's go. Marlon's you. I'm a big fan. I'm not going to pretend to be a Marlon fan. I don't care about baseball. I just don't care. Unlike so many of the people in South Florida, maybe a majority of them front running phones. Oh, we love them. Remember that panther business man seems like a lifetime ago now. That's the only reason we got that macarines sitting there right now. Because Wayne was able to suck the blood out of South Florida, playing at one big year into the building there now. Where they keep announcing 17,000, 15,000 and you look around over where are they? They all are getting something to eat now or what's the identified out that happened got free tickets anyway. Which is the nice way to piss off the season ticket holders. Or honestly, nice way to f**k off the season ticket holders. I don't know if you can get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance. about the screw those people, okay? With a 30 million year. There's the guy who's who ought to be doing something about it. If he really is the one that they're all coming after to try nail his assing and to knock him off the other, why isn't he doing it? Why isn't he to want to run into campaign? He's the guy that the Scott kid called first, not this show, but he's not doing it. Oh, here's a lovely story like this a lot before the break. Being a new Englander yourself. Yeah. Police rescue to Boston woman from the jaws of her seven foot Burmese python after the snake climbed out of where Arm and started squeezing. He was squeezing it. Wanda Nunes, 43 told the Boston hero that their python mama went for arm surely before she planned to feed her two rats, Saturday morning, I'm assuming for breakfast. She must have smelled the rats because she reached back and lunch from my arm knew he said, before I know what she was all over her racked around me every time I tried to prior or move she just got tighter around my leg. For 13 year old son called police after trying and failing to pull the snake off his mother. Police officers were able to pry mama off noon. He isn't put her back in her cage. See back in the day I had so many lines I could use in the story about a better not. Yeah. Newness of the snake was part of the family. He had no plans to get rid of her. The police wanted to put her down and she said, but I begged him not to put her down. Oh, come on with me. Have you ever heard a line like that? Have we heard a snake? I heard a like a we guard away. A horse, a dog. They wanted to put the snake down, which is probably a good idea. They found the employees goers now. The Janet Jackson top of the store comes complete with her away Velcro top. Mom, I can see Janet's movies. Hey, they're cool. The Janet Jackson top of the store. They're bacon. The ladies all kinds of bacon. Put naked in school. That's sassy. And coming soon, the Michael Jackson's hero way Velcro moves. I got your nose. 10 17 at 5 60 WCMS. We asked out in Friday. What is the worst sit down restaurant chain in America? No drive through that was the that was the a dividing point. Otherwise, if it has a drive through that. So I got a fast food joint. Denny's wins hands down your pants man. I'd even close 509. We despise Denny's. We can't stand it. It's nauseating. It's for like trailer trash basically, right? I like the service. trailer trash and drunken macologes kids who go in there about 3 30 in a morning. Yeah, you can't complain about the service attendees because basically there is many. The oligarden 256 magnificent choice. Crap pure crap. Anybody that eats at the oligarden? I'm guarantee also eats vanilla ice cream. I like the tour vitally. Waffle house 2 16, which I haven't eaten in one of those in so long. I couldn't give you an honest opinion. Apple bs 163, which Josh was not there the first hour this morning because he's doing something. Apple bs 163 used to work there. He said it sucks. I hop 158. I think if you drive around America, one of it probably the most. The most out of business buildings you'll see is I hops. You know what I mean? Yeah. Shows of a building. It used to be oh yeah. They look like it used to be. I have. I think there's one down in South Miami. They turn it into a adult video place. There you go. 158 probably even better stuff inside. Or can say that. Pizza Hut 142, Red Lobster 129, overpriced, uh, Crap. Shownies 114. I'm disappointed Matt. Anybody ever eat at the Shownies out there in a debut road extension? No. You know what I'm talking about? I've seen it off the side. I've seen it off the side. I've got the Hestation in Godfathers. I know it. There are a long, long time because back up North Shownies and last brothers big were pretty good. You ever ate at a Shownies? Once. Until that could? Yeah. Great strawberry pie. Golden Corral 105. Eat in there? No. That should be right up your alley. It's a smorgas board. It's a bluefeet. Pick it all a cafeteria 99 crackleberry crackleberry. Cracker burrow head AB. Chilly 61. Morrison's cafeteria. Oh, 160. Melting pot 57. Stookies 54. But man at peanut brittle, especially the stuff from 1932 is dynamite. Ben against 45. Fun rockers 45. They butter the bun. Friday's 41. Rascal house 40. The outback 38. The macaroni grill 35. That's a cheap shot. What's they're not to like about the macaroni grill. Besides the guy to get up on the table and sings old man a black river or whatever he sings old man river. Don't you like the macaroni grill? I do like the macaroni grill. Keeping in mind that they bring us free food all the time in their fine sponsor. They're great. The bread steak factory. I don't think I ever ate it. There's one in the sawgrass. But I stay away from the sawgrass. Perkins, packing has 26 which I like a lot. Hot 24. The ale house 20. Tony Romas 14 and Bobby Rubino's 10 out of almost 2600 votes. What's not to like about Tony Romas and Bobby Rubino's? What's what's they're not to like? I don't even know the Bobby Rubino still existed. Now I'm pretty sure that he's dead. That's his shiller around. I believe. So that's a poll from a Friday. Here's today's poll. It's not very exciting. In fact, the poll pushes out there that we have the audience. If you got some good ideas for some polls, thanks a minute. Because I'm really running dry as the expression goes. After a while, after the first 80,000 polls, you start running dry a little bit. Oh, let's do one we never did before. I don't think we did this one. Based on your knowledge of history, which in most cases is probably pretty limited, name your choice for the worst US president ever. Now Miguel's probably thinking this is just another chance for a cheap shot at Bush, right? Isn't it? Yes. Oh, and in fact, why don't we also put on here George Herbert Walker? How do we do that? George Bush the first? What does put, I could play H. W. But they don't know whether George Bush won. So here's the list. George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, Gillesie's S. Grant, Ronald Reagan, Herbert Hoover, Bill Clinton or George Bush the first? And they can add some art of this if they will. All I can imagine, probably who's the one Andrew Johnson was impeached? Not convicted though, just like Bubba. It's so sad. John Dean tells that Bill Moyers that Bush should be impeached. And you know what? He is right on it, man. Those hearings should be going on right now. Bill Moyers from Reconcil the present John, let's see on Friday with Bill Moyers. Former council the present John Dean tells Bill Moyers that he believed this is so poorly written. I can't even believe it. Tells Bill Moyers that he believed the Bush administration secrecy and deception over the war with the raction resauding impeachment. Clearly it's an impeachable offence. He says, I think the case is overwhelming that these people presented false information to Congress and the American people. And like I said now, here's Colin Powell running around. Oh, well, I got that information from the CIA. Let's hang George Tenet from an oak tree somewhere. Okay. Let's blame him. Telly. Man, you talk about scramble and the public is still right down the middle of 50 50. I'm going to make sure that the money we're spending actually. All right. Not to mention $100 billion. They're fussing on the toilet and it gets worse and worse every day and more and more dead bodies. And they hate us like poison. Not just an Iraq but all over the world. This was Dean's first TV interview about his new book Worst in Watergate, the secret presidency of George W. Bush. And the interview tape Friday in New York, Dean compares the Bush in Nixon White houses. There are many things worse than Watergate. He says taking the nation to war in a time when they might not have had to go to war and people dying. Did you see that? Was on Friday night? I'm sure you saw it on PBS. No. Why the hell not? It's on our website. So we actually'll transcript the interview. It's on there. Oh, and speaking of what comes around goes around here. Some good news. Yeah. Operishio investigated for indesensiv. All right. The crackdown on Smut on America's air waves is entered new and surprising territory following reports that less than open-minded federal regulators have turned their attention on unexpected target. They apparently perineally popular Oprah Winfrey show. See you made me brush my teeth to make them dark and talk. Got like fruit mouth. I know I have that every day. On a rampage since Janet Jackson let a breast slip from her costume during the mid game music show at the Feverfrey Super Bowl. The FCC has acknowledged that it's looking at the complaints that Winfrey may have crossed the decency line and at least one of her shows. Winfrey has Howard Stern, America's favorite radio shock jack to blame for her troubles. Stern himself has been the target of a relentless pressure from Washington to Tony on his broadcast and recently struck back by suggesting to his listeners that Winfrey was surely a worse offender. If they find me, they got to find Oprah the darling of the world Stern told his listeners to which to go. The DJ directed into his website where he provided a transcript of a Winfrey broadcast about teenage sex and included instructions how they could file a complaint with the FCC sources at the FCC confirm the agency had received about 700 complaints about Winfrey while most of them have might have been spurred by Stern apparently they've been enough to prompt a formal investigation. So far Stern's been able to cling on to his perch offering a mix of music and sometimes Emodus Chichet every morning on K-rock in the Urkund by Infinity Broadcasting who's already been fined for somebody's told his listeners but another broadcasting chain clear channel dropped him from any of its stations last month and it goes on and on about Howard this and Howard that got you out of yoddy. And about his stunner equal fools day when they did the first hour and no forty five minutes with some guys in their pretending that he got canned, etc. and so on because it's all about him it's all about more publicity for Howard and that's the sad part you know as if he really needs it. That's what he's all about. 560 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line look at that full man it's smoking at it oh yeah tons of people so our poll today is calling it name of bunch of prisons. Right? Yeah that little little do it call it a name some presidents okay like Calvin Cooler, cheers a good one. There's a bad one right there he's speaking right now. I just voted for George W.

Survey about politically this and about the acubines are much more Right wing than the rest of it is if we didn't know that The Miami hero that from there should be no more English version of the hero Just L. Harold would suffice please no more They're not kidding anybody President George Bush first asked Tony Blair to support the removal of The Sodom was seen from poverty private by house dinner nine days after the terror attacks of 9.11 9 days after According to Sir Christopher Meyer the former British Ambassador to Washington was at the dinner When Blair became the first formally to the visitor mark after 9.11 Blair told Bush he should not get distracted from the war on tears initial goal Dealing with the Taliban and al-Qadnaf Ganesh Stan Bush claims Meyer replied by saying I agree with you Tony we must deal with this first but when we have dealt with Afghanistan We must come back to Iraq Regen changed was already west policy It was clear Meyer said that when we did come back to Iraq it wouldn't be to discuss smart assinctions Elsewhere in this interview Meyer says Blair always believed it was unlikely that Sodom would be removed from power Give up his weapon to mass destruction without a war Faced with this prospect of a further war he adds Blair said nothing to demurre In other words he didn't disagree Details of this extraordinary conversation are published this week in a 25,000-hour article on the path to war with Iraq In the may issue of the American magazine Vanity Fair provides new cooperation to the claims made last month And a book by Bush's former counterterrorism chief Richard Clark that Bush was obsessed with Iraq as his principal target after 9.11 But the implications for Blair may still be more explosive The discussion implies that even before the bombing of Afghanistan Blair already knew that the US intended to attack Sodom next All of it continued to insist in public that notices have been taken until almost the moment that the invasion began March of 2003 His critics are likely to seize on the report of the two leaders exchange demand to know when Blair resolved to provide the backing of Bush saw And it goes on a great length. It's really well worth reading From the Guardian the British newspaper the Guardian Bush and Blair made secret pack for Iraq war nine days after 9.11 And the Bush are crew the neoconcerary decided on this long before that Well, what does that mean neo what is that prove? Nothing nothing I guess It's worth it like George says it's worth it It's worth it Now this this story here this really just drives me up the wall American justice jury acquits Texas mother who killed her sons You see this no you know the story of course. Yeah, how she bashed in their heads with rocks. Yeah The woman who claimed that God ordered her to bash in the head of her sons was acquitted of all charges by reason of insanity Saturday and Tyler Texas after a jury determine that she Didn't know right from wrong during killings A jury found that the Anna Laney was legally insane may 9th when she killed her two older sons ages six and eight in the front yard Let the youngest now two mained in his crib Laney 39 would have received an automatic life sense as she even had the convicted of capital murder Laney broken in tears as divert was right or husband keep Laney set solemnly with his head down a few jurors cried and struggle to maintain their composure State medical law allows Laney to be committed to a maximum security state hospital medical evaluations will dictate when she'll be released When she'll be released jurors deliberated about seven hours before reaching their verdict in the deaths of eight year old Joshua and six year old Luke in the beating of Aaron Defense attorneys argue that insanity was the only reason why a deeply religious mother who home schooled her children would kill two of them and name another without so much as a tear She deeply religious and insanity seems to be the being redundant there. There was no crime said Tom to carry one of Laney's lawyers. She was insane there can be no other answer See I am an asking for years. I don't I mean you think Ted Bundy was saying David Berkowitz no John Wayne Gacy you think that those people were saying never makes any difference in those cases You have to be insane to do the things that they did but when it comes for the purposes of of American public's anger We want justice so we like either fry those people or the law prohibits that we put them away forever But in this particular case because she was a good religious lady deeply religious home schooled her children she must have been crazy at the time All five mental health experts could sell it in the case including two for the prosecution one for the judge concluded that a severe mental illness Cause later had psychotic delusions that rendering capable of knowing right from wrong during the killings These standard for in Texas for insanity Psychiatrist testified that she believed he would definitely chosen by God Just as Mary was chosen to bear Jesus to kill her children as a test of faith and then serve as a witness after the world ended She all sounded he crazed you then any other religious person quite frankly Crazy In closing arguments earlier Saturday prosecutors portrayed the killings last mother's day weekend as the separately planned and coldly executed It was graphic. It was horrific and it was brutal Prosecutor Matt Bingham told a jury Bingham pounded as fist in his hands. He recounted Joshua's killing. He got strike after strike after strike on his head at the point that his brains were coming out of his head like liquid Prosecutor's portray the killings as deceptively planned and coldly executed. They said that even if Laney Belichi was doing right by God She had to have known she was doing wrong by state law her first call they pointed out was to 9-11 to some of the authorities So she was crazy after do it, but she was saying enough to call 9-11 and say hey something wrong just happened here Maybe she had picked up the wrong phone. Maybe she really wanted to call the bound the bat line talk to God And see if he was happy now to cut the wrong extension. Yes. She just got the wrong extension. Good point So she's going to go away to some institution somewhere and then we'll you know slide for on a rest of come out again. You'll keep your eye on that down the road She'll be carrying a heavy load down the road. Look at this planned ball baby. I'm seeing it in you know basically The last year okay, you wanted one more year where you might think baseball should be banned I think they just should end up right now. Why it's dramatic the drama again blows. No, you know, you don't even like baseball. I love baseball based on what It's a great sport. It's boring his helmet. It's not even a sport. It's boring the intricacies of it. It's dramatic is what how many times somebody scratches their private's in between pitches How many times somebody like pay rod for example or punch how many times he crosses himself before each pitch. That's pretty dramatic You're just you're just negative about everything. No, I'm not a mess. I'm not negative. I'm standing up play awesome all excited about your on America. Friends you about that. What you're on American. You may have a point there Based on your knowledge of history name your choice for the worst US president ever I'm certainly not on America when it comes to football in the your patriots. That is true. You know what the really sad part of that is Yeah, that had to be the probably the most exciting Super Bowl game in history I don't think there's too much debate about that nobody nobody remembers not only who won the game, but the game itself All they know about is Janet's booby. That is true. Now, what does that say about America A phenomenal game the Patriots win the Super Bowl twice in three years. The dolphins are foaming at the mouth I think it's great that J. Feele is going to be back for another go go around Do you have any idea how bad that often is going to be this season AJ Feele man. Yeah touchy Feele touchy Feele And if the N. A guarantee of Michael Powell finds out about that you won't see him no more touchy Feele They're going to be really bad But so I guess it was a propitious moment for the people of South Florida Even though we lost freedom of speech it was well worth having Janet pull at the booby out because everybody forgets about it There was a ball game and who won the game Here's the final total now on his first poll which really sucks I like to wonder about the Marlins video we do it every year and a lot of people lie a lot of people lie like crazy Just like all those people were going to send in money first stop FCC and we're going to do that now you're not full of crap 321 votes based on your knowledge of history name your choice for the worst US president ever in a history of the US of a a George W.

What could you be doing more important than sitting on this very important show? You might actually learn something all the way out in your case was it's hopeless. I'd be listening to you feeling No, you would not My knowledge of history name your choice for the worst US president ever now. Yeah, we I guess we currently put a put JFK on here We'd had 800 votes oh The BF pigs BF pigs with hell you know all about your people you know somebody's to go But they're all listening to WCMQ FM anyway Now you should be able to tell us what they're playing on CMQ FM. You should know it's probably your crowd They play a lot of old Spanish we know that give us some names give us some art What what does that mean? This is so typically Cuban man. It's like it's like that other Francisco Ruka is the best way to show on him. What what what time is he on? I don't know yeah, I don't know he's the greatest in the world, but he don't even know what time he's that much less I'm just going to tell you what he's talking about as the same thing with CMQ FM You talk to any a Julio down here in South Florida. Oh, yeah, well, CMQ FM is sticking out as they're playing oldies Well, well give me one That's not not the whole playlist give me one artist that they're playing I wouldn't like that they don't know they're playing disco too Disco what disco duck like disco music you mean American disco music? Yeah, oh No, didn't we already go through that would smigmer radio with cheap channel? We already go through that phase and we got real hot for a couple of months Hey everybody wants here that again, and then after they heard it they if you know 8,000 times Okay, that's enough. We like the beat. He's been not that much. We like KC. He's not a battle queen, but at that much, right? So that's what they're playing. That's what they're playing American disco yeah on CS say M. A QA F A N A Holy crap. Well, I can get some of that out. I like that a summer Anyway, worse president and his major is WB267 71% hate him like poison Jimmy Carter 38 He felt that malaise through the country, you know, and now of course now that he's no longer present now all of his studies Running around the world. He's making peace over here. He's making peace over there. He's a piece of this piece of that I thought it was cute when he said, you know, he didn't invite he didn't invite Howard Dean The Georgia that was cute. I think they're kind of sealed his fate Bill Clinton 25. I don't understand those people have got to be no speaking glazed grub because eight years of prosperity Things were wonderful. He didn't kill too many people in close to my just enough. Well too many Richard Nixon 15 Hebert Hoover 10 Ulysses S Grant the drunken general 8 Ronnie Reagan seven and George Herbert Walker, Bush seven See he was you know kind of small potatoes very whiny wimpy Now no taxes that was here to him. He was a wimpy and why as opposed to a son who's really just them in See, I don't think most people had really strong feelings about Bush one Am I right? Yeah, he kind of passed on to the radar. Yeah, he was just saying yeah, you know a whim Just like his opponent just like Michael do caucus is the Democrats once again Here's the only man in America who probably could have outwim George Bush the first Herbert Walker Bush and that was Michael do Kaka house kitty doing Carlisle Now this facts I'll tell you one thing. What he said it is the holidays wait till you're this one from Mark Happy pass-off Two things I thought the reason for pass-off and Easter always being so close was due to the fact that Jesus was Hebrew in the time of his crux of occasion I'm not even sure if I can say that on the air. I think you might need crucifixion and Hebrews reselibrating pass over On another topic just look for thought not wait till you hear this see if you can figure this out If JFK meaning John Kerry wins wouldn't it be ironic that we'll now have another chance to fight another Vietnam But this time he'll be commander in chief so if you realize that Kerry was so anti-viet after his tour of duty where will he stand out that he's the commander? Do you understand that? No, I think what he's trying to say is that we're in a crime liar right now Just like we were in Vietnam and Kerry after his tour of duty over there spoke out very strongly against the war just like anybody else with the conscience and a brain did See all this crap about oh what he came back and he was one of those war protesters Well more power to him there were 58,000 kids came home and body bags Didn't learn our lesson Traject Then here's the stuttering girl who means well his pool. I don't I don't what to do about the presidential election If it comes down to Florida voters he's got four choices a lot of bushes army to invade Florida A lot of the SEC to bleep out all the Kerry's votes Don't allow the southeast part of the state to vote or none of the above. Oh, I'll start over kill. What while you're head yet? It will go to one last time kill. What your head? 560505050 Now this this is terrible this thing of your friend mode. Did you make this picture up? Oh my god, Gellie the muskrat from Hebrew is on top of Mozhead He then Moz Moz did do a go jet sting Wow, how are you for new governor of Iraq? People are really whacked out too much wine. I think with a monster and I haven't even really started yet Fine, let's go to a say there. What do you say you want to go to a say it? Are you going to a say there? I'm not no Please don't you don't need the no you don't need any more excuses for eating okay? Just like me Don't need any more excuses to be eating just stop eating. I think is a good idea Just take a nice deep breath of fresh air That's it. That's enough. Okay. Here's our next pool. Here's this pool for the rest of the show We got that we're gonna look nobody can blame us. Let's get this town with that for tomorrow. What do you say? Oh? What's up into a frenzy 50,000 plus screaming raving fan are gonna be there tomorrow? Because it's opening day. I still say I don't understand that baseball has successfully unlike any other sport There's no other sport you can name me We're opening day is got the significance that baseball has created in the minds of the public. It's a it's a state of mind thing That'd be correct. Yeah. It's a state of mind. Oh, but it this is a special way It's opening day, but there's on ridden 61 other games. Oh, but this is opening day. Yeah, it's spring again It's you know flowers are blooming time to go see the ballic symbolic example symbolic of one A new season You want to marry what about what about the first and let me ask you this. Yeah, which sport you think there's more interested in South Florida Just New Sample the NFL or baseball NFL right now the first dolphin game home game Is there anywhere near as much interest now for example in college they have the home coming thing But that's I don't that's just a silly other tradition, you know But in the NFL the opening game isn't the mean any different from one of the other games No, the first game of the season down here is pretty big you're wrong for the dolphins and in fact I'll tell you how wrong you are Last oh, do you got yourself into a by now man? Who did they play opening a home game last year Houston? He's been right which they lost by the way And if you recall they had I have the local team and they had the local affiliate buy up the last tickets because the game was gonna be blacked out And you know what I am? Right See just because I have the body of an elephant doesn't mean I don't have the mind of match That's because people don't go don't go to games down here anyways And what about all the other games that weren't blacked out? See they go to the games based on how many people who support the other team show up how many tickets the other team buys hockey games basketball games football games and baseball games like when the Yankees if the Yankees play here to meds Right, yeah, there you go red socks. Yeah So the fact that it was Houston the anxious Houston Texas a second year expansion team What did that say? That's why they weren't gonna sell it out In fact if you recall the first bills game went right down to the wire also almost wasn't sold out to Buffalo bills right The arch rival Buffalo bills they're not exciting So in other words, it's another another deal whether they're excuse yeah any time there's an excuse we won't show up. Well, that's why I'm taking the pool because it's the biggest excuse town anywhere And when they would Samson when the owner Jim and Rennluria when they say oh well That's nice you to offer to build a sustainable over there or give us the original, but that's not good enough No, how about over here now? That's not good enough either. What a bunch of morons man Anyway, let's see not a bit not a little bit zero teeny tiny bit not a that's my vote I'm just being honest with you. I'm not gonna be a phony and jump on a bandwagon 85 votes already just went up there for crying our love not at all not as 028 I'm a fan. I'll go to a few games 24 and I'll let's kind of like you know like both of you That's what I voted right in the yellow go to few games because he gets a tickets free Yeah From me. Well, I'm glad I mentioned it. Do we have the tickets? May it What does that mean not yet the opening game is tomorrow right there? What is Ray Perry standing out on the street corner selling those tickets now is this another one of our revenue stream Just like that phony auction that QM head last week a shame on you people.

It says half off a guess what it only applies to limited selection by them That you'd never choose anyway everything else is full price and then they probably doubled the regular price first And it's supposed to seal merchandise and you'll probably never be able to make a first change if you don't like it either but At dialometrist the rides have no tiny print notice claimers when you call 1 800 mattress You'll see their prices are so low other stores have to offer half off sales just to be in a ballpark to compete See there it is again ballpark go to the seat of Marlins dialometrist got a no risk 30 day comfort exchange policy All beds including the one you buy don't forget when you call dialometrist at 1 800 mattress you're getting company ranked the best anywhere in overall customer satisfaction from candlestort Palm Beach to Ford Myers and dialometrist reminds you to read that fine print because they watch it Know what you're buying even if he decide not to buy from them.

I am giving up that that is correct I'm not gonna argue with you about that. I'm giving up. Let me ask you this. Why should I be doing this? So what has the champion the cause but but someone who's got an audience? We know and we don't reach enough people we can't do it. I wouldn't mind being the catalyst That's what I tried to do see. I'm not even in the beginning even as optimistic as I was I'm not that stupid to think that I might have me on some stupid ass sports station with a crappy signal That I'm gonna like change the world But at least I wanted to be a catalyst We try to like spread this around a little bit whip up the signatures Hopefully get some people to call some of the talk show people around the country get them to promote it didn't happen Are they gonna participate? Oh, no, wasn't gonna happen Nobody cares I'm not gonna change your human nature. I'm done. I went through this thing 18 years ago We took out ads and radio and records at Billboard magazine all this crap and then the people in the business didn't care They just don't give a crap Take something right now I don't want to start mentioning names because we have a lot of people in the building who do help Whether it's our whether it's our charitable with the best stuff stuff every year that we do You know Hank always helps out big time in the mad dog and Greg read and screw in there. There's some people that are tough always never let us down Always come through But then there's some other people for example us since we just had that cartoon even even your good friend that mole myster when we did the best of this past time Let us use his Drop-ins for the key change right right because he's an animal lover a dog lover and it was a good cause. You know all that stuff Right But we have some other people in the building who are like in a they're in a vacuum They're in an island somewhere. They have nothing to do with his show They don't know from it and then that's that's fine. That's up to them I'm not gonna mention a names guilty. This is an example 567560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless law let's get let's get a thousand calls on between now and to what do you say? Okay You think oh no because I only took one at a first hour and a half here now and it's so that was the guy who said that Lincoln the free to slaves How much do you care about the marlins not at all zero not a 71 that's 41.2% and I appreciate the refreshing honesty I'm a fan. I'll go to a few games 38 22.6% a little bit 39 and a lot I'm a huge fan honest 23 13.3% 172 So the bandwagon is still overloaded with those 50,000 plus people are gonna be there for Opening day tomorrow because it's a happening baby. It's a thing. It's a thing Opening day why near this is opening day for Christ say yeah, what does that mean? I mean I was a baseball fan since I was a little kid you know before you guys were born right long before you were born because I'm an old fart But I don't I never was able to understand that opening day. It's a holiday. So what happened with you in baseball? What happened with the means like a tired of pampered over put over played jox Wining and crying an addition to which as I became a little bit more mature as I got a life I realized that sitting there watching his crap or is it's boring now? Let me ask you an honest question Okay, how many baseball games on television forget about going to a game and having a couple of hot dogs and being there Where there haven't a few laughs how many games do you sit and watch from their first pitch to the last out? The whole way through I can't How many NFL games do you watch when you start watching you watch all the way to the end unless it's a blowout a lot more all of them if it's a good game. You like all the way to the end and beast Yeah, I'm run the sand pages me go. Yeah, so now what's the reason for that? It's different It's Ball A baseball game you're once you're at home. Okay, see when I was a child I used to listen to the games on a radio and it was my island and red barboring There was Bob Prince and Harry Kieran. He made it very exciting and all these guys get quinn on huh? You got boog now make it exciting And then we got the balance that out we got that stiff there Dave Ann Boy which everybody on the station for some reason Shills for I have no idea why just because he's got a bad hairpiece and lovely wife What is this story with that why do people stick a he is so poor that call that they played on the promos for the marlins It's a miracle they sold any season tickets The marlins win the world series that the world champions holy car, you know, I mean that was pathetic Now if the booster be under doing a whole game then I'd say now we're talking I saw a big piece of the paper very jackass everything on Tommy Hutton Tommy Hutton is good. He doesn't do the play by play on TV does the color. He's very good. Yeah. He's pretty good. Can we agree on that? And who's the guy that doesn't on TV? Do we even know his name? Yeah, Len Casper who? Len Casper Oh, you speak in Milwaukee. Is he friendly? Yeah, really nice guy 27 past 11 at five 60 WQM if you're a dead end job like the beast Who's just barely making enough to keep up the core can take every day if you're underpaid no for work Maybe like have yourself a new high-paying career, but you just don't have four years to waste on college or the cash it takes to go to college for four years if this sounds like your situation Then you ought to call our friends at fast train seriously even though it's a top record count call them at one 866 fast train because these people can have you train and certified for a great high-paying computer network professional career And they can do it in just four short months.

We don't have that all far to the I was they're opening day Who was the old Nakaball or Charlie Huff member there? Yeah opening day tomorrow Ons actually was a fan until I just decided how boring baseball wasn't about how greedy these guys are and I'm on payroll Got the 25 minute you're that at that point I said okay, that's it. I'm headed. Bye-bye. You're out American. No, I'm not I'm ready American more and more people would agree with me to be in fact both of you agree with me that baseball is boring You both agree with me You You play the tape back you both said that it's boring and it's like you can actually an entire you can rarely sit through an entire game That doesn't mean it's boring So why can't you say the he-be-gb's is that it? I mean the snow was waiting for and the table maybe you can smell the Kentucky fried the other room. What's the excuse Mr. There's so much time in between pitches you feel you can flip chairs so much time in between pitches which makes it Ballroom there's no barbecue. There's no beer. It's not sunny after you get to the ball back from the catcher And he stands there and now he's rubbing the ball. I mean can I still say that he's rubbing the Right and then maybe he's even rubbing his own yeah, maybe that too. That's why I'd like to watch him That's what she wants to see. Do you kid you're hockey the sports fan my ass okay? Put see that's another thing about the suck holes we got working on that station You got to you got to pretend to be that that's one thing I'll say for a little drawer, okay? Because he's a hard ass and usually when he's on vacation I represent but I'll stand up for a minus He doesn't care about sports. He's not gonna pretend that he does We would go back a girl. What is it? It's because he throws like a girl. Oh, you haven't confused with Duff now He doesn't care about sports and he's not gonna put on an act and pretend like Duff for example Or some of the other people in the building or not sports fans at all, but because it's part of this Greg read this mental illness that he has that he suffers from it So sad and so Greg is so mad on himself with these these Jocks nippers like screw in who wants the sniff OJs Jock strap from back and it was buffalo bills days. You know, oh, give me a good real old rancid one. You know That's what we got Gary Sarner He knows from you. Oh, sports nerd sports These people don't know from anything else.

That's my opinion on that's my take All this begging and begging. Oh, you got to build a system. We already built Wayne a nice bigger way to their embrouder We got to a decent team. Oh, we got to play off team. Oh, do you realize beast at that team of both of you? Yeah that team has made the playoffs How many times in its existence Give me a quick answer. I'll say three more than two less than four that is absolutely And the big year when they won the well-arweight of the finals and got swept by Colorado That was the great year that was the only thing it kept the franchise in town and built Wayne that's arena He stepped into a bucket of stuff again like he always does Then it was the year that they played the Rangers and they lost in seven and then there was here They played they when they had the great team with Burai and Whitney and Melon Biel's guys and they got swept by New Jersey for straight So if the last 12 playoff games they've played and they've only played in the playoffs three times in the entire team existence They've won one in lost eleven Not an impressive record not something that should inspire people to continue paying those gigantic prices to come there See what I'm saying I fall in a heart girl. They say oh well this team needs some defense, but now they got the money They got the money to get the gonna spend the money. Remember how they were gonna spend the ten million dollars from a Pavel Burai Yeah, I was gonna say did they spend it? Oh, no Because they're loo they're drowning in a sea of red ink and I'm cool and you can keep making you can keep making up 40 attendance numbers All you want especially when Gary betmans in the crowd You're not fool on anybody.

Anyway, Miss Fudge says, three university-amurlin students are facing disciplinary action for shouting questions and comments of the vice president's wife Lin Cheney, washed in postes reporting it's today's editions. There was no open microphone at Cheney's February 2, and at the parents' guests had been told a submit questions for in writing. Instead, two of the students called out their questions, one on game marriage, the other on slave reparations. The third student loudly uttered a vulgarity in response to one of Cheney's answers. Two of the students said they've been accused of disorderly or disruptive conduct on a university policy design, a protective rights of speakers, from a shut-up off-stage or ground-out by contentious audience members. The students said that they weren't disrupting Cheney's speech, that were just asking questions. And in her cases drawn the scrutiny of civil liberties advocates who said the university's action and fringes on the students' right to free speech, what the university officials appeared to have done appears not only to be in violation of their own speech, but also the first amendment, what's that? The first amendment? Oh, says Susan Gearing, in no relation to Hermann Gearing, but spelled the same way. Executive Director of Maryland's ACOU. All of these guys were just speaking out of turn. Cheney's speech was a precise ban and CNN. Certainly not news. Is that something? Something. She had Muslims erupted by and by and by and by, and not job. And to me, they've got a search warrant out for they have big, much kea, hope it had. They've got a search warrant out for the big guy. The one that gave the order. They said, don't ever give an order like that again. Oh, speak it all in Cheney. A publisher is cancel plans to reshrew a racing novel by Lin Cheney, wife of vice president, Dick Cheney. After she said the book did not represent her best work. You didn't dump that now, did you? No. No. Don't you dump anything? In fact, in your case, maybe go take one. By the way, Josh's hair and Miguel's gone. Well, thank God for that. No, Miguel's okay. Miguel was good today for Cheney. Well, it's because you were so bad. You were pathetic. Now, you're going to put you up this last day. We only got two hours tomorrow. Try to save your amateur for 10 to noon tomorrow. Not after we're not by the ball games on. All right. We got the Marlins on deck at the 1245 Marba. The good news is we got real excitement. We got old penis phase. Joseph Gacky, new to 1245 with P.P. Park tomorrow to get the build build up for opening day. It's opening day. Don't you understand what that means, Neil? It's awesome. Why couldn't you save the day van horse stuff until Josh got here? Maybe Josh would like to comment about Dave and Bore. I don't have anything to say, I'm here. It's a good guy. I'm talking about his performance on the air as a baseball broadcast. You don't start all like this little simple and tough a crap. You've got sitting across from me now. What's your opinion on Dave and Bore as a broadcaster? He's been doing it a long time. No, not I don't need a chronology. I don't need a lesson. I was in Montreal doing the games on the internet for crying. I love nobody would even put him on the air. He's all right. It's fine. Now you're lying. What am I wearing? The lio meter has never exploded. The way it just did there like that. You're just lying to your teeth. Why are you doing that? I realize you're making 15 cents an hour. And I know this also you started to talk to your teeth lately. Are you trying to be? What's the guy's name? The Erica that does the heat games. What's his name? Eric Reed. Eric Reed. You try to like emulate him. I don't even know that is. What's your talk and through your teeth now? Who that is is who he knows what he's been beastly talking through his teeth. He must be a broadcaster. I start to do his teeth. Don't do that. Welcome to the QM School of Broadcasting Live on Air folk. Oh, right. We're trying to butcher the beast up a little bit. I'm as well try and him. It didn't work on Duffer Clarence. Anyways, we have a Lynn Channey and her Dijk novels. New American Library, an imprint of Penguin Group, was going to reprint sisters. A historical romance published in 81 that includes brothels, attempted rapes and a lesbian love affair. Oh my God. We felt interest was growing because it was an election here. We decided it could be a timely books at Liz Pearl Executive Director of Publicity at New American Library. She told the AP on Friday, Library. And of course Dijk's are in now. The current of Cheney's attorney Robert Barnech, he did not even know about the reissued to receiving calls last week from the media. Barnech then caught in the contact in the publisher, which agreed this week to pull the novel. I told him she didn't take the book was her best works at Barnech who represents numerous political leaders including Bubba and Hillary. If there's a series demand for this 25-year-old book, I'm confident America's youth bookstores will be able to satisfy Barnech said. I didn't like that. She doesn't want the book coming back out again because it's an election year and she wrote a bunch of Dijk stuff in there and she's got a daughter that's a Dijk. There has been a fricking liar who said a couple of years ago back in 2000 during the campaign, he thinks people ought to be able to marry whoever they want to marry and the Yatiya and again, and get involved in any kind of relationships they want because he's got a Dijk daughter. But now that El Presidente is chandling hysterically to the religious right to the bigotry of America, well now Dijk Cheney says he'll support that constitutional amendment after all. So that's why Lin Cheney is trying to cover up her Dijk novel from 23 years ago. But quite frankly, Dijk's weren't anywhere near as much in as they are right now. Were they? No. How do you like that? I like that. Fascism man, you can hear them boots. At least there's a little bit of the pressure really now that Miguel got out of there with that whole exile thing. Wow, it's so sad. He's really a good guy, but he doesn't have any ability. He is the classic example of a brainwashed human being right there. Am I right? Yeah. That's all he knows. That's all he knows, the beginning, the end, everything in the middle is speed del, speed del, speed del to hell with the del Castro de Est Castro de la Comunista. And that's it. Common hysterames with the Tista. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and rise in wireless line. Last time I checked by the way, but Tista was a fascist. It wasn't a leftist. He was a fascist. Like we've got it in Washington right now. Just kind of leza a police a condolesa. And you're like that story about the fact that they forced her to testify that they headed the 9-loving commission was going to put those pictures out in the spread of on every front page of a newspaper. How about that? Yeah. All of a sudden, well, guess what we decided would be a good idea to have condolesa testify publicly. We decided it would be really good. We're not there's precedents now. Mm-hmm. WQM, hello. QAM. Nobody there online for. Pretty sad response here, man. We're trying to get everybody whipped up about that Marlon game tomorrow about opening day and about Dave Ann Boring. What a great job he does and was Marlon game. 560, 0560. He's the Teflon broadcast. Do that must be it with him. Is there something I'm missing here? Because anybody else they just ripped them in ass. They have no compulsion. They're no problem at all. Just ripped ripped ripped. But with this guy, it's like, oh no, you're wrong. He's an excellent broadcaster. Even rumors said that. Because I think Dave Van Boring's got naked pictures of Rimmer from his days of Montreal doing the Canadian games. I think he's got naked pictures of Rimmer and a moose. WQM, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Okay. I just want to say something. I've been calling for 50 minutes now. Okay. This is my 42nd phone call because I've counted them. Right. For the phone rings 30 to 40 times and you get this continued. But third man. Right. Exactly.

And what about Dave Van Boring? What about you think about him? I don't, no, I like Len Casper. And I'm going to ask him about. See, here's another thing. I don't listen to it on the radio.

Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Nice job there. Josh, you let him call 42 times before I picked up the phone because he knew that I was going to rip our good friend book. He was a little not to like boo, but first, see, I don't understand it. He doesn't like boo. But when I ask him about Dave Van Boring, see, he does listen to the games on a radio. There's something going on here, man. I'm, I'm not really. There is something going that I'm not getting to. I think when we finish with the 9-11 investigation and when we finish investigating the FCC, we need to investigate the Dave Van Boring. The Dave Van Boring factor, you know, there's something. He must have, they could purchase everybody in town. He's got to have. I want to see. Wow. It's a 1213 at 560 WQM. You know what to deal is? It's so cold here that actually have my clothes on today.

I'm a baseball fan but not a Marlins fan See this is a whole different dimension of this question Right, in other words there might be people who are like Yankee fans, God forbid or Red Sox fans beast Yeah why don't you admit it, you're Red Sox fan, you don't care about the Marlins I like the Marlins but I like the Red Sox fan You like the Marlins? No conflict, they're in less than a Marlins fan And if the Marlins played the Red Sox in the World series, I'd root for the Red Sox Okay, well it's just like me in the Leafs, I'm a Panther fan But I'm much much much much more of a Leafs fan And if Leafs in the Panther is a plan to play off, if the Panthers ever make the playoffs, which I doubt But if that happened to be I'd certainly be like when Leafs played in the regular season No, we see you in that Leafs jacket, they'll go to them real happy for it Leafs number 4 seeding the conference, doing just fine, thank you One of the last two games with shout outs, nice going Eddie, shut an out buffalo, two Nothing right there in Buffalo and then whipping those, you want to think about auto I don't want to get hockey intensive, have you noticed when it gets to the when it gets to be crunch time when it's the big game Auto folds up like an accordion, have you noticed that? Yeah, they really suck And anyway, I hate to break the bad news to be you realize you have to play in the first round of the playoffs, your Bruins, Marrell Which they have a long sad history of the Montreal of kicking through a Zassan play on I know he's expected to And watch out for that Josie theater man, she is really tough How much you care about the Marlins? We're adding on on a baseball fan, but not a Marlins fan, however you want to put that on there Well, well way to get the new one on there, I should have done that in the beginning Because I'm sure that we have other people who are, you know, they're excited about the Cub's fans Right, the Braves fans like Moe That's a little bit intense to be a Marlins fan, but see I don't understand how you can be a fan of two teams in the same division That makes those sense I mean, how can you be a Braves fan and a Marlins fan and say, well, I'd run for the Marlins and set one there playing the Braves Well, they're competing with each other in the division Well, he's a jet set a dolphin fan No, he's not he's a jet fan Oh, right, his whole as whole family were his jet's paraphernalated the dolphin game and people hate them for that And rightfully so Disgraceful I mean, cut the abilico cord with you, Moe You are so full All the crap you could unwrap Now we know that 560560 On the 1810 Parisma with a 10 Kennedy on Larry King that I'm a King monster I just mentioned that Don't you just love 10 Kennedy, well, you want to be a Vine from Boston? I voted for him There you go Uncle Teddy Well, he's so liberal, yeah, he's the one liberal who isn't ashamed, you know, the right wingers have made the word liberal a dirty word over the last many years 10 Kennedy is the one liberal is not afraid to say it It's right He's going to kick some ass on Larry fact I'd like to see him kick Larry's ass tonight Just start stabbing his suspenders Debbie fun WDQA and hello QAM Not there 560560 Pound 560 on the I guess all the enthusiasm about this Marlon thing is all gone And they won't they won't come at about Dave VanBork Because they probably don't even know who he is He's he's like a non-descript You know what I mean? He's like a non-descript Now when Jo Angel was doing a game You know who Jo Angel was because he's got his own free Just think to stop Sure, brothers are in the win column Dave will Brian, Dave will Brian to me And I'm so glad to see that he's like basically vanished You know he does the ESPN stuff he here once in a blue moon Because there's a guy that was so arrogant, that's such a big ego And then he got into squeeze out Jo Angel and fire his ass And then he he high tells it off the ESPN After they fire Jo Angel to make him the big superstar for the Marlon Broadcasting And he leaves and goes to ESPN He's a you know he reminds me of he's a cookie cutter announcer He's generic it's just like the stadiums that they built the three rivers and riverfront Either they once and all look the same that that's him the cookie cutter announces They all sound the same it is high and outside of all Second all those has a graduate from Syracuse They're like programmed like Bob Costa's like a guilty Here's line 9 QAM hello What was it what do you mumble never mind?

Sports nerd Must have been a radio answer it again you're sure without a sports show to which I say thank God Thank God for that If there's anything worse than a sports talk show man I can't think of what it is maybe terminal maybe terminal cancer but I'm not sure it's a close battle Could you just do it once just a sports show? No no no Now Clarice must be feeding your lines again And always feeding you something Sports Okay, let's see no how much you care about the Marlins and You know something see this isn't a fair representation. This is a representative representation of the general public. That's the idea If you ask the sports nerd question, it's like it would be like asking a bunch of people who are on a website that's all about the Britney Spears Okay, well, do you like Britney Spears? See yeah, or does that make any sense to you? No, of course not How much you care about the Marlins not at all zero not a hundred and forty nine or subludes? Aren't you excited about the blue date? For SNFHG, no only on Rogers digital cave. She even got my own digital cable deal. We're on up here. Not at all zero 149. That's a third a hundred that's 33.1 percent Of this audience you turn a little bit 117. I'm a fan. I'll go to a few games 115 a lot. I'm a huge fan on his 66. We believe you 14 and a half percent and I'm a baseball fan But on a Marlins fan only three so far. Now that's just went up there, but that's not like a whole lot Now maybe some of those other people might have voted that if it wouldn't have been for Josh coming in late. See if Joshua would have come in on time He would have thought of that said, you know, you didn't put it on there fat, so he didn't put this on it But Josh was busy his apartment was burning down or something like that. Yeah, something like that. What was it? I had to get the rent in. You had to pay your rent? Yeah, basically. Well, you do that in person Today is the fifth so I had to drop it off at his house. Yeah. Oh my god. What a schlepper man. Why didn't you tell George before he left for vacation? You need to take care of it for you? Five six seven. Oh, but now what is this that you just dissent me here? This looks better than excellent check it out three days and two nights What is this? Is this an an or this is an an I just got on my fact. I said. You what? I didn't set it to you. No, it's an ad that I just got a fabulous minivan case in calling would just 90 minutes north of Toronto and heart of Ontario's four season vacation Wonderland sounds pretty good. These ads you get on the fact they just won't leave you alone no matter where you are. I'm actually even in prison. They probably have like you can't make phone calls from yourself, but they'll make an exception if it's a solicitor, you know Five six seven. Oh five sixty. We got the mad dog at two we got Joe's a gacky it for for which we apologize profusely in advance for the Hebrew hammer Who's doing a final four crap? Joe will be a chualestate to my me lakes Seven o'clock in suracle in hotline. Have you participate in that who does that show Joe's doing it today? I do it sometimes you really do the show Yeah, well, I hope you're more animated than that show than you are today for the big I'll hit a clock any k10 and then overnight we just sign off Russia's a junkie head Oh, that was pretty strong Medication Like always Russia's a junkie head You're good Oh, I was in a gation Or my back here I shut the gation I can't even escape I don't know where it is Russia's a junkie Russia's a junkie Oh, what the fuck was that? Oh, what the fuck was that? The fuck was that? It brings me down It looks a whole lot better than millions of movies I've got to hide that I would flow Still rehab at least one totally We're inny Of Russia's a junkie Russia's a junkie I'm off, I'm off, I'm off, I'm off I'm off, I'm off, I'm off All right 33 and speaking to that Speaking to that, Rars Limbaugh may be a flash-plot of inflamed opinion in rhetoric, but it's the dry 20-minute quarter appearances attorney will make this week that matters most. Limbaugh's attorney Roy Black will argue Wednesday before the fourth district court of appeals in West Palm Beach that Limbaugh's medical records were seized illegally and should be returned to him. The appellate's courts ruling could be an end to a possible criminal case against Limbaugh or a beginning. Oh, right! Without Limbaugh's medical records, prosecutors may have nothing to base their prescription drug investigation on, with them, they will may have. Limbaugh 53, why has been charged with a crime yet is being investigated by the state attorneys or a office allegation to the doctor's shopping, which is dupping a practitioner in the giving overlapping prescriptions. The crime is a felony implored, otherwise we're early prosecuted. Limbaugh and Black, and on something that would be, uh, when we already done that poll, I think we did a few days ago. And then we bought, who would you rather see in jail? Mark the Stewart. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we did that. Yeah. See, thank God for Josh keeping a little bit of trash. At least he listens to the show, not that he wants to, but at least he's a gutter because he's a captive audience. Unlike the sports nerds that we have on a station, who are busy sending feeds over the stew gods at the competition at WRFX. Nice going, or clearance, you idiot. You see, if I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but if it's me, and I find out that my program director is feeding the competition context of the news stories on here, I fire or is that that day? No questions, I fired. No, I mean. Yeah, OUT out. Is he out again the beast? I'm right here. Oh, that sounded like Josh to me. I can't really tell you. You start a sound alike, which is not a good sign. You're not feeding him extra food now, or you know us fat people, we like to make it not important that you lose weight, but they make everybody else fat. That really is the secret like fat rich. It's the same thing with all the fat people I know, including me. It's not important that you lose weight, but that you make everybody all fatter than you are, which in that case, please do better get several lunches ordered for him. How much do you care about the Marlins opening day tomorrow, man? It's a special day in America. Opening day, you can smell the leather. Can't you? Yeah. Now, what bars that were you smelling the leather? Not at all, zero, not a 162 probably the stable mastery in Amsterdam. You're probably going to some of them. Parties. Not at all, zero. 162. Why can't you see the beast in Amsterdam? And you would just go nuts there. Have you ever been there? No. Oh. If ever there was a person that I know that it's their kind of town, that's perfect for you. Why? You want sex? Pay for it. You want weed? I mean, it's all over the place. It's just your kind of place. Okay? There's a lot of strange people are a little bit hundred hundred twenty seven, a little bit about the Marlins. A little teeny tiny like maybe an off-blast no one or two pitches. That's it. I'm a fan. I'll go to a few games hundred twenty four. That's a good sign. We need your money for that new stadium now. A lot. I'm a huge fan on a 76 all the way up to 15.3%. We love the Marlins. We're all fired up. That's right. And I'm a baseball fan but not a Marlins fan only five. I've almost five hundred four ninety four only five people are baseball fans like the Cubs, the Braves, the Metz, the Jankies, the Tigers. I'll be likes the Tigers. Now see there's a good example. See they built a new stadium? Yeah. Detroit? No one goes. Anybody going there? No. They wouldn't any games? No. No. I mean, Marlins, yeah, they won the World Series twice in what? Uh, 70 in six years? twice in seven years? 97 in seven seasons. Right. Right. Pretty good. If you ask me, pretty outstanding. Right. The only problem is nobody really cared when you saw people looking for refunds that after that big ticket tape parade in downtown Miami when people were trying to get refunds for the Marlin caps and merchandise. That was not a really good sign. You know, that wasn't a real competence booster in terms of how solid the support is. 560, 050, 50, 50, pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Marlins line it's a screenless money because every day screenless on a show. Not much action there though. You see that? That's because they're all getting a cause it's a holiday week. I'll be honest. We're actually doing a little better than the half. I thought we would this. Why don't I take this week vacation here? We're much luck. Go to the right thing. Huh? Take this week vacation. There's no one around. Okay. I'll start right now. Bye. 560, 050, 5060, pound, 560 on the AT&T line. Hugh A. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Pretty good. Good. I got a future poll for you if you want to hear it and I got a couple people on the list that I want to propose to you. The poll is which of the following on the list despises No hour David the most. I got about. Oh, that's a little crappy. They're the mob pools. They're so it's an interesting story. And I don't want to pee on your parade, but it's just it's old stuff. Why you just I would like to know what the audience thinks more and anything. Okay, all right. You know Joe Rose or you or keeping guilty because I don't think guilty likes to me either. Hey, some. And so I I you don't leave off the beast or me, you know, put me on the list too. Okay. Josh and Miami. Thank you. Okay. Thanks Josh. That's not a bad idea. We I guess we did the long time ago. We might bring that back because he's kind of like fading into the world. Absolutely. Like furniture, you know, refurbishes image. The polish up that must red and bring it back and show them out to the world. Look, look, what we got. We got Howard in the morning. You want Howard in the morning? No. Not that one. That one these days. What do you think? We definitely put the beast on her because the beast hates him probably about as much as anybody ever meant my life. I mean, I mean, I'm not just a regular ordinary hateful with a and intense hatred so deep that wouldn't surprise me if he's occasionally tended to do something rash and violent like stabbed a muskrad or you know something like that. I would like to pull it off us head though. And the muskrad too. We've often talked about that. Have you really? Yeah. Now, let me give you a little I don't want to make the audience think that I'm giving you pointers on how to give some of your nervous breakdown. But many years ago Jerry Wichner, do you hear the hear the name? Yeah. Jerry Wichner used to do overnight send W to use back in the day when I was doing eight to midnight. Jerry did midnight to six. He was one of the most red and he bigoted Yahoo real red neck. And Wichner used to be this lucky WYNZ back in the day when it was like a real radio station before they run cheap jail wounded. And he was very popular DJ and he would go out and do record hops and stuff like that. So he went out and had some high school or somewhere did a record hop and the kids haven't only got on the, it didn't take a genius to figure it out because it was even a worse piece than what motorways. It was like multicolored. I used to call it his comedian hairpiece. It changed colored. And so they ran up in a they stole a right off his head. Well, the rumor is and again, I wasn't there because it's so long before I came to town, but rumors that he just they're lost it. He just the kind of disappeared for a while and had a calm down before it came back. Good thing that was before Jerry got all on pieces. He used to walk around with. I just came up the Ho Chi Minh highway. Oh, he was he was something. He was if you can't ask me who is the most bigoted person you've ever known in your life. I think it might have been an old Jerry. We're sure he's dead now so we can say that we just got some new lovely t-shirts. Did we and how much you have to pay for them that we can't t-shirts now. We're going to be auctioning these off on the Beesley broadcast for profit the website. What what's our D for? For the Beesley charity and the revenue stream. In fact, we understand that the reason that we don't have the baseball tickets in there yet is because rate periods auctioning off Marlon tickets. Probably my tickets and Norma kids tickets on the corner of 441 and I was jury road and the four. Oh, yeah, four hundred and county line road. Right up here with the homeless voice people are. That is so sad. Where am I Marlon tickets Ray? In quarry mines would like to know opening a day as tomorrow last time I checked probably I got some people that would like to go on opening day. I would think. Sure since it's a tough ticket again. I got those great seats. I would have some people I know who would like to go to that game tomorrow. Ray Perry get with it, okay? What does he do there, Ray Perry? I'll let him give the tickets out. Does he do anything? He's our go between between the teams and the station. Yeah. He's kind of like the middlemaston from my O.D. Do a he's the imp. He's the sports pimple. 19 to one is for Miguel says he has your tickets Miguel's got the tickets. All right. Oh, and he's probably leaving through their furiously and frankly for him right now. That's how he can do it. How are you told him go ahead and the leaf through and then Josh probably wants a few two. Sure. Now to beat the beast. I'm sure you get your own tickets. So sure. I have a press pass and I'll get tickets for what do you need tickets for if you got a press pass. I want to take the girlfriend. You get you get to have now with all the big shots up there. You get to have now with the booster and with the lend Casper your good friend David boring. How about that's why the beast won't rip David and boring because you got a face him up there, right? Not not exactly Josh does Josh does what Josh works with them every day. Well, that's why that's why why didn't you tell me that before you put him on a spot and you had to make him say what a boring third burger he is that was bad Speaking of boring third burgers if your carp is looking a little on that side like not too good these days.

I wish he would have gotten to it. The Japanese have household appliances that separate water into alkaline water and acid water, the former being for drinking, weight loss being water the benefits and the latter being good for bathing. And of course the French they use both for the same. They be the and the drink it. I just drink it break by the way made by one water. You'll be pleased to know. A lot of it. Because when you drink gallons of caffeine free die, coke every day, it's you know. I'm sure it's not good for you. Ask for payment good for you right? It makes a wood alcohol in your body. Right. And you're like fried all the time. Every time I try to do the nutritional thing, they always like the first thing tell you stop bringing diet soda. Right. Well, okay fine. I'm more than willing to do it. And I've got plenty of markets and supermarkets, whatever. I can handle the freight. I can deal with. When I asked the guys of the question, and I, what should I be drinking? Well, you can make your own water. Well, I'm not going to make my own water. Are you? No. Of course I'm asking a wrong person. I asked you. No, I would not. Josh going to make his own water. No. No. I don't know anybody. It's going to be, you know, see, this is the problem with the nutritional freaks. I mean, maybe this guy may be 100% correct. But the fact that matter is that when you carry something that's such an extreme, it isn't practical for most people. I'm not saying make it simple for me. Don't send me anything. I don't need you to send me anything. Just tell me what to do and he wouldn't do it. But I beat, but I beat. But I know. Thanks a lot, Eric. Okay. Jericho. I know he's got a lovely Japanese wife. So he knows all about that. Japanese stuff. 560560, pound, pound, five60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Yeah, let's talk about maybe that'll be our polar tomorrow. What's your favorite drinking water? No. Yeah. Better than your favorite flavor of toothpaste. I like the spring water. Spring water like Mount Valley. Sure. From a hot spring's Arkansas. There used to be a spot to mine while back in the day. That's good stuff. In fact, once a pot of time you stay with the liver to the house all the time. I can give me some good water all the way. I don't like, now I don't know about you. I don't like flat water. In other words, with no gas. Huh? There are two kinds of bottle water. There's like plain with no gas. And there's Gassata, like the Italian's with the little like carbonated. Like the the Pelligrino. San Pelligrino is excellent. And that the carbonation gives a little. It cuts to the the flamin among your throat. I hate that. I hate that. You hate what? The sparkling water. Really? My mom drinks that. It's horrible. No, it is not. Why do you say it's horrible? It does. There's a lot more people drink the sparkling water. If you're a person for bottle water is huge, then drink that flat water. That's a, oh, maybe. So drinking alca salsa. No, it's that. Let me ask you if you got a bottle of coke. And I'm assuming die coke because when you waste out of her pounds, you ought to be drinking. And to say to me that it doesn't make any difference with the drink to sugar or not. I got my little diabetes. Need to in the other room. They're my acute check. And I guarantee if I said or drink and I don't ready to be on the floor. I'd be in a diabetic coma. If I was drinking as much coke with sugar or some drinking dyes coke. No, no, no. There's no doubt that the real thing is bad. Really bad for you. What? And you kind of real soda with all that sugar is really bad for you. With regular soda with sugar, of course, it'll can you man. It's pure sugar. Make your blood sugar skyrocket. I mean, this guy's talking to a diabetic. Anything. I don't know what it's. See, I can't stand the, the nutritionistic stream is they're all experts. And then you look at them and they look like itch about crane on a bad day. Oh, yeah. I used to have a sponsor many, many years ago back in the day. I'm I'm a beach on KT and this guy was the nutrition store. Health boots throw on a beach and all rotors somewhere. And and a guy. He had this customer who used to the we used to call him the garlic man. Now, you couldn't get within 50 yards of them because he's stuck like garlic all the time. He, he weighed, I mean, soaking wet after a heavy shower. We went about 40 pounds soaking wet. He made current carpenter look like mama cast. And you know, if that's your idea of being healthy and being, whatever, I just, I'll pass on that. How much do you care about the marlins in about bottle water? That's our pool today. Not at all zero. Not a 2029.7% it dipped under. For the first time, it's under 30. It's exciting. I bet today David Samson is dancing. Kizazuki would Jeffrey Lourier right now. 600 80 votes. I'm a fan. I'll go to a few games. I'll go to some games. First of the tickets are free. A little bit 170. A lot. I'm a huge fan. Honest 114.8% that dipped under that 15% mark. It's not a good sign. And I'm a baseball fan, but not a Marlon fan 19. That's pretty low totally. You know, and I guess the other people already voted for the other stuff. It's a beast bad. No, well, Miguel's bad. He wasn't, he's not there. And I was blame him. Miguel's bad. Should have corrected me. So how about put this in there, right? All Miguel. Of course now that we got that Cuban population. We're going to support that baseball, right? Right. WQM Hello. QM Hello. Not there on two or three. And these must be, I don't know what these people are today. These must be the people that are off this week because of the phony holiday. WQM Hello. Yeah sir. Hey, near the expecting one 35,000 at the Marlon game. 50,000 man. They've sold over 50,000 seats. I'm going to go Wednesday when they're expecting about 7,000. Right. You have a lot more elbow remote. I love the stadium when there's only 7,000 there. You feel like you're the whole same here yourself. Right. Yeah. I think the only problem that being at a good way to get a ticket out of town. But there you go. There's a guy at the likes of when it's empty. Has elbow room. It's not crowded. I understand what's coming from. I like it. I like it. I like it. I'm a two man. Can I tell you where I enjoy sporting events? The most. I'm a company. I'm a company of my sofa with my fan asked sitting there watching. That's why I enjoy it the most. Typical self-large of sports. No. No. Not at all. Not at all. Fact out your R&T. I've got a more dolphin games in my life than most of the people listen right now. You're in T of that. And paid for my own tickets back in that day. But I got tired of the drunks of the people spilling their beer all over you. Of the fist fights and the stands of all the crap of the people that stand up when you try to watch the game. It's like going to the Panther game. I mean, a few people that are there. You think with all the empty seats you might actually because I got a great vantage point there at the arena. Got great seats. But the problem being they're standing up. The usher's are letting them come down when the game is just starting to go with a face off takes place. And the guy I'll never forget that guy that's up in front of me talking on the cell phone was buddy down at the other end. While the game is going on, that all the action is down at that to my left where he's standing. And I said sit down. He says, how common. I said, because I want to see the game. What game is that? And what? This is for 205. You and the two. The ball on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority. Neil Goon. Jessica with us. Yeah. Let's let's the trick to achieving longevity. I'm sorry. I think about often. Completely madly abused drugs. Yeah. Party. Just take some calls. Johnson City Tennessee is on with us. You've got Nick and Jessica. Go ahead. Hi Ryan. This is Andrea. Oh, hi Andrea. Jessica. Is it true you don't drink milk because you can't sit your head in the curtain? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, is it also true that you hired a private detective to find out if you've related to Homer and Bart Simpson? Yes. I don't know what I'm going to do with her. She's out of control. I love this Ohio. You're on. Yeah. You're touching the Internet about it. Nick and Jessica sex tape. Is that really you guys? Definitely. Yeah. Will we have a clip? Take a look at that Nick and Jessica. Nick and Jessica. Yeah. Huh. Wow. Why can I get a copy of that in stores? Yeah. Okay. I know we're glad to. And deciding to do this. Oh, no. We're so happy. We are so happy. We could off on stuff like that. 133 you know I interrupted myself. I was gonna put you on a spot when you said you hated the carbonated water Yeah, now what if you open up a bottle of coke Diet or regular whatever it was and it was flat, but you know how you open it and sits there for days and yeah And it's flat and there's no carbonation. That is hard that no But do you say it's horrible? Yeah, so then why would you want to drink water with no carbonated? Because water is meant to be Yeah You're supposed to drink water that's not that's flat not bubbly Some of the where somebody told you you're supposed to drink it. That's the way I like it better I like my water better. I think it's more refreshing not that little bit of that effort Vesson doesn't like put a tingle in your tonsils. No, but it's just a flat. I don't have any tonsils Neither do I but still puts a tingle now see what just watch yourself because now we got that nervous Nellison or cheap ray he said You gotta see it's it's one thing to react with all the SEC business. It's going on. I've come to the conclusion After after seeing the way that certain people like every time I ask a quote oh should I call up Naples and I ask it? No, you should not call up anybody and ask stop creating more problems where they don't already exist, you know? See what I'm saying yeah. I mean I ask an opinion and of course since I can't get an opinion because and I should be asking opinions I'll use my own opinion. I'll use the judgment of being on the earth this town Long time I think I got a real good idea where the line is even the new line the heavy heavy thick heavy handed line I think even I know I got a pretty good idea where it is and so if there's a little F*** that doesn't quite meet up to the muster some people in there too bad. Okay. Let him go take some pills Let him call up Wilma and Self-medicated little bit in calm down, right? Yeah, you know I'm talking about yeah Everyone machine names now listen, Lloyds of London, Susan Marlins I don't want to put this story on here that they be for opening day because that would not be good Would make it appear it's in a hurl though Alice Hernandez made $35 million pitching for the Florida Marlins even though his once promising career pretty much into that first season And remember all those Julios that we're gonna come out to see Alice for and is did they show up now? They're like everybody else they're much of front running phony's there. They're no different from anybody else. No, we're right If it's a winning team hey, we love them. Marlotte. You know all that crap And if they stink they'll stay home The team which guaranteed his five-year salary through 2001 turned a lois of London recover about $7 million in disability insurance for his injured shoulder the team's injury claims sparked a bench emptying legal brawl The extra money would obviously help the financially struggling world serious champions But the team isn't likely to see it anytime soon after the Marlins suit for breach of contract The world's best known insurance underwriter alleged that the team defrauded the company by submitting to identical law spams the lois and the Hartford life insurance company for for and is his torn rotator covering a 2000-2001 seasons The Hartford company didn't know the team already had disability coverage with lois because the Marlins and Fernandez never disclosed it on an insurance application Core record show the Hartford firm and later Lloyd's accuse the bulk of reaping a $2 million profit through a lead deception The Marlins eventually settled their dispute with Hartford and sure which wanted its money back So they've lied to the Hartford company They've lied to the underwriters at lois and it gets much worse than that Lloyd's Miami attorney Fred Rick hasty the turd said an August court hearing Lloyd's then hurled another charge the Marlins trainer or team official Placed whiteout the correction fluid on Fernandez proof of clay a law screen that was submitted to the London based underwriter In court papers Lloyd's lawyer is alleged forgery, but didn't explain the significance of the material allocations on the injury claim They wanted something out Now Lloyd's pants asked former make sure we understand That we're not talking about the crude ownership our good close personal friend that Hank whip the last last week I was going there, hopper. We're talking about John Henry They plan to ask former Marlins owner John Henry now part of the red socks what he knows about the whiteout and an upcoming decision Before the case goes to mediation in August 12th after November. So what it gives us that position? They're gonna say come on. What do you know and he's gonna say? I must be crazy. I must be nuts. Yeah, that's your guy by the way I'd be pretty embarrassed. I've done in the own any or all of my team I'd be humiliated to be a red socks family. Can you see the owner?

Bush's campaign work has hit on the age-old political tactic to deal with a tricky subject of global warming, deny and deny aggressively. The observer in England is obtained a remarkable email set to press Secretary's of all Republican congressmen advising them what to say when questioned on the environment and the round to the election. The advice tell them everything is rosy. There ain't no problem. There's no global warming and the whole story is on our website. Also, big Arne says, Coca-Cola's great flat. I love to bottle it, open it, throw away the top, and then dear to its awesome. It becomes like cola punch. Give it a try. And to prove that Arne is at least consistent. Also, it goes well with soggy salad and he says he likes soggy Cheerios too. He's got Magnificent Taste, which is why the Guardian listen to the Arne. Am I right? Okay. Anyway, the mandags coming up next and then Joseph Gekki for the upper and fourth. Marlins baseball in Nuna Mara, we salute those Marlins. Bye, bye, bye! In the fall, the suck in already!
