people at calm now this is a whole new floor mad man we got to figure it out listen if anybody wants to fact I have stands for let it happen on purpose the Ly hop theory puts forward the accusation that bushing is people allowed these September 11 to text to take place despite the fact they've been repeatedly warned of an impending strike the Ly hop theory is straightforward in the month before 9 11 American intelligence agencies received ominous warnings from the intelligence services of nations like Israel, Russia, Egypt and Germany these warnings were pointed and attack involving hijacked aircraft and prominent American landmarks was imminent our security forces were told bush himself was briefed these warnings weeks before they happened instead of responding vigorously to these warnings the bush administration and its security apparatus did nothing Ly hop is of course the purest breed of conspiracy theory involving high-ranking members of government from both parties as well as the CIA the FBI and the NSA like all good conspiracy theories Ly hop is surrounded by disturbing facts and bits of evidence that are difficult to ignore the warnings from all those foreign intelligence services after all are quite real Egypt, Germany, Russia and the Israelis were both syphores in their concerns the German intelligence service BND told the US and Israeli intelligence that Middle East terrorists were planning to attack commercial aircraft to use his weapons to attack important symbols of American and Israeli culture the BND's information came through echelon the American control network of 120 satellites that monitors all worldwide electronic communications Egypt voice similar warnings that say month regarding aircraft the text delivered just before the G8 summit in Egypt's alert carried such weight that any aircraft batteries were placed around Columbus airport Niddly the Russians were the US at the same summer of 25 pilots who had been trained for suicide missions and put themselves delivered the warning in the strongest possible term to the US government the Israeli intelligence service massade delivered a warning to both the FBI and the CIA detailing a major assault on the US against the large scale target that was very vulnerable the Washington Post is reported that the NSA intercepted two messages on September 10, 2001 warning that something was going to happen the next day tomorrow is zero hour was one of the messages the NSA's charter is to intercept translate and pass on to FBI and CIA operatives important electronic signals from all across the globe the echelon satellite network which provided the German BND with their 9-level information last June is part of that system according to the NSA the September 10th data was not translated until September 12 but it stands to reason they were privated the same electronic data the other foreign services were using as the basis for their warnings one US intelligence source claimed that had provided no actionable intelligence a fair claim given the vagueness of the messages in the volume of material NSA must deal with yet in combination with the stride and foreign intelligence warnings the words intercepted by our large electronic ears on September 10th the other one is the one on September 7th then there are the threads a female official told Dan rather that the disaster agency have been at the world trade center at September 10th why Governor Jeb Bush of Florida side executive order number 01261 on September 7th putting his states national guard on heightened alert status essentially placing Florida under Marshall law for no demonstrable reason why attorney general John Ashcroft stopped flying on commercial aircraft in the week before 9-11 something he had commonly done since his entry in the administration why at the core of the lihab theory lies motivation what possible purpose could be served by the Bush administration allowing a terrorist attack to take place on American soil it is flatly inconceivable the most Americans that Bush and his people could demonstrate such calisdous regard for American lives and accusations that they allowed an attack to happen week of the worst kind of poisonous partisan politics why have theory however is not so easily dismissed two French intelligence analysts John Charles Bersard and Gium Daske he had published an extensively research book entitled Osama bin Laden the forbidden truth in it they alleged that the Bush administration put energy policy before national security concerns according to Bersard and Daske a fondering pipeline project into the state of the country's list of the national law that was being done by the Bush administration when it arrived in Washington January 2001 the pipeline project with sought to bring oil and natural gas from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan to a warm water port had been the brainchild of American petroleum giant unicell from much of the nineteen ninety unit cal that's not where allowing came from is it and how many cars i after the destruction of two American embassies in Africa nineteen ninety eight by Osama bin Laden the Clinton administration for bad any American companies from doing business with the Taliban which had been celebrating uh... bin Laden Afghanistan you to cals pipeline project was frozen after the Bush administration came to parb restarted in desk he alleged that re-invigorating the pipeline project became a high priority matter of policy assistant secretary of state Christina rocker was dispatched to Pakistan to discuss the pipeline with teleman officials in August of 2001 rocker a career officer with a CIA had been deeply involved in agency activities within Afghanistan according to documents for sard and desk he claimed to hold the main subject of the discussion was oil a Pakistani foreign minister was also present at the meeting in witness the exchange how does this pipeline relate to September 11 according to Bersard and Daske the main obstacle to completion of the pipeline was the fact that it had a pass through Taliban controlled afghanistan the project would have would receive no international support unless the afghan government some of the king legitimized and targeting for the pipeline the bush administration demanded that the Taliban re-instate the post king Mohammed Zair Shah's ruler rafghanistan and demanded that the Taliban handover Osama bin Laden for arrest in return the Taliban would repuntled billions in profit from the pipeline according to bersard and desk he part of the bush administration's bargaining tactics involved threats of war if these conditions for the legitimacy of the generation of afghanistan were not met the BBC of London reported on September 18, 2001 of the existence of war plans on bush's desk aimed at Afghanistan the as night performer Pakistan foreign secretary stated that the war plans were slated for October 2001 condition set by the bush administration to avoid war involved the Taliban's handover bin Laden and the acceptance of king Shah and iquenso far as to doubt that america would hold off on war even if these conditions were met the reason the bush administration very much wanted the unicale pipeline to go through and put intense pressure on the Taliban to see it happen as this was happening American intelligence services were flooded with warnings of an impending attack on american targets by bin Laden and al-Qaeda the decision was made let the attack come in an ensuing outrage american forces can carve out the guts of the Taliban government like a right-goard replacing them with a legitimate regime or receptive to the pipeline plan did the bush administration have an inkling of the massive death and destruction that would come on September 11 those was spoused a lot of theory disagree on this point somebody hang on one second because i have an interloper coming in my apartment right now even though i have the do not disturb son on the door okay for you sorry i have to go back to you i'm pretty old home and day yeah i'm gonna think of it on the door every week i come back at two but she obviously no speaking lies you know how that goes anyway that's where you would know your mimey did the bush administration have an inkling of the massive death and destruction that would come on September 11 those who espoused a lie hop theory disagree on this point some believe that the famous presence of ground zero on the day before the attack coupled with specific language within the international intelligence warnings pertaining to aircraft and high profile targets our prime of a she evidence of specific prior knowledge others believe that the bush administration only knew vaguely that in tack would come but not where or when they did not proceed the level of destruction ever caught flat footer when those planes appeared along the earth skyline in the end lie hop theory can encompass either view whether they had specific knowledge before hand or merely decided let some attack happen somewhere the final results were the same the Taliban were routed and replaced by an interim government headed by a man named hamed car's eye car's eye was recently elected president of Afghanistan and his own right legitimizing the Afghan government soon after this car's eye announced the opinion constructive a pipeline that would exploit per communist and natural gas reserves he names unit call is the lead company for the project before becoming president car's eye course was an advisor to unicall you guessed it for lie hop theorist the evidence is clear the bush administration got the pipeline it wanted along the way they use the horrors of nine eleven a place themselves above reproach it was in the patriotic fervor that resulted from the attacks both the press and the democratic opposition were bracketed by the administration espoused idea that any questions or criticism were ten amount of treason the passage of the paper and the entire act is given the west government sweeping abilities to stop the sent by the finding it as terrorism thanks to the loosely defined wording of the bill bush enjoyed stratospheric approval ratings that persisted this day this was as a junior two and of our concidices were given new enemies to hate the defense department and the weapons contractors who cater to them received billions from the federal budget to do with his day plays in order to address the objects of that hate the most hardened political observers must admit the dismal truth September 11 was the greatest thing ever to happen to the bush administration attorney Stanley Hilton has brought lie hop theory into the federal court system with his pass action suit and with the families of nine eleven victims he represents it will be interesting to see what transpires when these two facts collide in an American courtroom given the current climate doesn't seem like they'd want to come up after all these conspiracy theorists are just a bunch of nuts right right that's what he says right Williams rivers Williams the rivers pits

pretty good idea the one we posted was the one and only nip shot that was the only one the only one worth posting well that's your assignment now Georgia's scouring the universe now and maybe somebody else out there's got some booby pictures some booby traps and got all those what else of christina although I must say that Anna Farci pal see whatever name is farty falch and a falch he's he's uh I have a lot of the hotter than christina would ever dream of being well any command well i was not the truth she's a but love Swiss she is uh flawless I would say that's a great way to describe it from Swiss flawless there she is right there she makes christina look like uh stuff that I dropped in a bowl this morning okay in fact even without her christina in my opinion I she's just mousey looking you know real mousey but would lot of makeup with all the tricks that they do they can make her look really hot you know she looks like crap christina but I think she and the Carson daily are the same person look at that look at that Anna falch you man I mean what's not to like there that is if you're not hopped on that thing right away at least a picture and a forestart when we in cruel springs is I just found out I missed the first this is great I missed the first half hour your showed it a what kind of crap is this you said the show starts at eleven now I find out that some people get it at ten thirty what you just don't have the right kind of radio Greg who are these people are they special yes how do I get on the preferred list of meal fans I've been listening you for over twenty years and resents some nearly come late the getting more of you than me please put me on the preferred listener list a bass in that last trend with the miracle we have any kind of list of that you only right wingers and red necks which is the same to and sportsners got the reason they are months of September how many diaries did actually get sent back but thirty men because of the hurricanes on this stuff it was it was it totally bogus month which isn't rationalization but anybody with a brain knows that Howard Stern didn't have a one point to me share and men in the banana clock hour I mean that's uh it's just ridiculous and that let me also know that party radio didn't make this uh phenomenal comeback like allegedly it's number one in the afternoon anybody with a brain knows that that's my opinion I'm like this they know that party radio is that is a durney or the same six records derooten whatever they're playing that's my opinion I'm like Disney all right we got it and anybody also with a brain knows that there are no head of a sexual males under the age of four hundred listening to love ninety four so it was just all a pile of uh duties what it was speaking of that here's some good news carry has lead in date poll says this is by zagby international democratic presidential businesses in the harrelts or might be true John Kerry holds the comfortably among date county voters much as former vice president al-gord in 2000 Harold Paul says the biggest exception we say with great regrett and spite of rumors to the contrary the biggest exception is the Cuban American vote okay which still overwhelmingly favors bush they just can't get it right there in little havana they're still living in a path even though now catheter says he's not gonna take American dollars anymore and we got this uh he you know he's gotten all pissed off and better to shape because of this new bush uh hard line so that the people's relatives over there gonna have to suffer even more than they ever did before but that's okay they just can't stop with a bush crab the poll conducted for the hero by zagby international shows carry favored fifty four to forty one in date but among Cuban Americans of voting blocked target by democrats nearly seventy nine percent say they back booch booch booch if you talk strictly numbers carry is in very good shape in dates obviously said but if you talk about intensity Miami is a testimonial in many ways to where we are as a country high intensity polarization there's polarization in the organization for the poll seven hundred fifty likely voters recall October twenty two through the twenty fifth margin of error is plus and minus three point six percent zagby whose company is in yudica New York where they drink uc of course uc club uc here we're here though spot course not cause you never look down up sitting here uc club uc and probably out of business said about ten percent of the poll workers were floated as spiny all date county that most highly populated county in this important swing states been the focus of a political batty adi adi adi adi adi adi adi adi and listen at all the other crap another gonna be able to fix it again in date county in two thousand let's look at these numbers okay because right now it's carry fifty four and bush forty one over all in date in uh two thousand it was fifty three four four forty six for bush so it carries doing three points better than gorded right now current the poll among human americans nearly seventy nine percent of the favor bush it also falls close to the total four years ago when just over eighty percent of human americans vote of work so in other words all this crap about well the humans have learned their lesson their pissed off at bush they're gonna vote for carry how many are we talking about about thirty men right bush all the way said can swell of illamani seventy four a human american woman who participated in the poll he says what he means it means what he says in other words abugar raped right the other guy flaps into wind like a sail Mike melnick a Jewish voter from north Miami Beach so he was findable for carry because bush didn't have a grasp of the complex issues that threaten the middle class what an understanding of that is I don't think we could be in more shape melnick said carry understands the issues he's addressing the issues important in the middle class by the way how about that reduced that low consumer confidence in number yesterday huh wow took a huge dump the biggest dump at about four thousand years in a month of September the poll show is Jewish voters and in the county supporting carry eighty two to fifteen percent oh a larger margin in human american supporting bush only problem with that is if they're gonna like compare one of the other there's a lot more humans than they've counted than there are Jews see so i'd be said bush had failed to make inroads with a Jewish vote bush campaign spokeswoman mercy viana shlap she's no shlaperman said that bush's message in his candidacy of strong support and data who cares what she says or be the carry guy so there you go Dave county so far as the latest i'd be poll fifty four percent for carry forty one for bush bush bush and if we'd stop letting them old cubans vote we'd be in love with her shape now and proud what we got a message in like that guy who called me for a better call then it was the next one point he made i hope you people stop and think about that about how fraudulent your elections have become when i was a kid 400 years ago election would take place and if they were going to fix it they do it behind closed doors real quiet and nobody had a no about it now we got hang in charge we got balance being torn up where the stations being torn up absentee ballots not being mailed out i mean god only knows the kind of crap they're doing because sure the brown county board of supervisors election office pointed a finger at the u.s postal service yesterday for nearly sixty thousand missing absentee ballots but took the blame for having a phone system that was being overwhelmed by calls from first rated voters were pissed up and fired off while the post office denied responsibility for the missing ballots proud county commissioners anxious to avoid another field election offered to send county employees to help with the phones doesn't employ is could begin assisting the elections office see i don't even know if my vote's going to count you know right i have sent he ballot i mean it was mailed the eight ages ago days i don't even know what's going to count dozens of employees could begin assisting the election office today to answer telephone calls and the process voters at the uh... fourteen early voting sites what we're seeing is unprecedented so if the supervisor election sees our help we will help county mayor i mean the leverman said it's a week to the election in voting is a basic right in our country you go i mean what a perspicacious observation on her freaking part just six days away from the general election they supervisor elections office has fielded hundreds of complaints from people who have yet to receive their absentee ballot they are pissed up and fired off countless more of an unable to get to the election office to complain or get their questions answered i tried for the last week or so to call the elections or a fist and it's just busy continually said policy box in seventy who's four week old-request for an absolute ballot's gone on answered i want to vote election officials also said they launched an investigation found that many of the missing ballots fifty eight thousand of them were sent on a trover seven tonight to probably say this is something that's beyond our control deputy supervisor elections just sell a salice post office officials say they're not at fault we have employees that we assigned a handle the absentee ballots are come in said you know or rice booksman put the postal service out for the district so all the absentee ballots that are received by the post office are processed and limited immediately in other words probably the other fifty eight thousand we just borrowed Schmidt-Canderson these four people voted five sixty double you can say I'm in a middle reading that story about a half an hour ago and there's a tap at the door which I ignore of course because I'm in a middle reading the story on a year doing a radio show and it's the salice illegal alien made again coming you're out here there you see him nine votes absentee ballots there they're all over the workplace there's so many people voting in a state where money like that so we got ballots up the ass baby all over Florida back home all over the place so I have no fear the election will be stolen parents square just like four years ago okay how would stir and get it away he did exchange with FCC commission chairman Michael Pollard in radio call and show yesterday with the shockshock saying the only reason Pollard in his position is because of his father US secretary of state the anxious colon pal who always gets left off the hook because he's like complicated there was let him off the hook you know again the other day there were show no scrips of him sitting there in front of congress and in front of the uan you know both clips lying and lying and lying we got the maps they got all these chemical steering center friend told him the commissioner was going to be on the show and decided to call because Pollard consistently avoids me and avoids answering my questions does it make you nervous for you to talk to me's your anast know it does not poll reply moments later sir and called poll and and nigma and said you're the judge you're the arbiter you're the one who tells us what we can and can see on the air got he didn't even look like joys and yet I really don't even think you're qualified to be the head of the commission you deny that your father got you this job's your anast I would deny it exceeding before sir and hung up poll told him good to talk to you yeah good to talk to you wow so I guess lying runs into poll family right to what's in and goes on about clear channel paid this and this one paid it poll was appointed by the way the FCC by president Clinton proving that nobody's perfect and promoted a chairman by president bush because daddy of course is secretary of state and nobody don't like daddy for least if they do it can't say it in public because he's a like-complexed dark guy now now I like the way that we get to take the calls in the fact in ten thirty be perfect time for how to say goodbye which of course he'll say goodbye when he feels like it every day but it worked out well today you know it because then we can make a lot of appointments for people to call like a ten forty one uh fit a bit yeah well we'll give you a fit secret plans for the war in Iraq were passed to British army chiefs by u.s defense planners five months before the invasion was launched a court martial herds today this is in the independent UK you sure is how I could read in the u.s weekly reader the revelations strengthen suspicions that Tony Blair gave his agreement to president George bush to go to war while the diplomatic efforts to force automosand to comply with he went resolutions were continuing while they were continuing with that dog and pony show for public consumption to make it look good. Allen Simpson the leader of labor again you and showed that clear short was right to a certain her book serialized in the independent the mister Blair had noingly misled parliament. The plans are revealed during the court martial of uh e and blame or twenty three from leads who charged with a manslaughter of a combat while serving in Iraq sergeant john night and gale thirty two a reservist from west Yorkshire died after being shot in the chest September twenty-third last year. The court at Kattarrakerson North Yorkshire heard that contingency plans were drawn up by lieutenant Colonel Christopher Warren staff officer at land command south-bray Wilcher who was responsible for operational training. Lieutenant Colonel Warren said U.S. planners had passed on dates for which the invasion was planned the hearing was told at army chiefs one of the training for the army to start at the beginning of December 2002 however due to sensitivities the training was delayed sensitivities in quotes. The court heard the training for the TA began two months late and for the regular army one month late lieutenant Colonel Warren was asked what the sensitivities were he replied because in December there was a world interest if the UK had mobilized while this was going on that would have shown an intent before the political process had been allowed to run its course the hearing was adjourned. I didn't like that. So it's right it was rumored for the war was cooked up by peanut and all these lunatics including your fat ass governor jet bush by the way who's a prominent member of the project for the new American century a bunch of neocon lunatics and guess what it's blown up in their face and everyone around telling that John Kerry is an armchair quarterback all these draft judges all these chicken ox all these guys who never held it higher than their waist and a gun either. How's that pull coming I'm getting whipped up about this damn crap we only got six days to go you know we can't afford another four more years of this crap and you think freedom of speech is limited now you ain't heard nothing yet which of these is most interesting the U.V.

Probably most tight-pisted in a whole bunch, you know it. Yeah, probably 3 at 5.60, WQA and happy Wednesday too. We got the mad dog. We still rise right on cloud nine after that big dolphin went on tonight and it hit 10. Here's a fact that says, please give more info on the article you're ready concerning days before 9.11. It is, isn't on your website. Well, I'm sure it was once upon a time back in the day. The articles from June of 2002, it's written by William Rivers Pit P.I.W.T. Got it. P.I.T.T. as in its deputs. If you want, you can just Google Stanley Hilton because I just during the break read a whole bunch of other interesting articles about how they broke into his office and told a bunch of files. He's a bad man because he told too much of the truth. I wonder how long he'll be walking around. Anyway, Google has Stanley Hilton to a search on that or just go to truthout.org and to do a search on William Rivers Pit and some of his articles. This one is from June 2, 2002. Got it. Got it. Think they're going to do that? No. No. No. They're busy looking at on a faulty and who can blame him when he can write down to it. And they're looking for a lot more information about Miss Kamal. Right. Miss Kamal and that evil Kamal. Well, they could go to busheslored.com for a few laughs that they are not too busy. Okay. Well, we got a busy week for them though, between now and next Tuesday. And like the guy before was saying, you know, carry in bushesl. It's getting pretty pondrists, but you know what? And another four or five weeks when they're finished counting the votes. Then we can move on to something else. Right? Right. Another four or five months when they're through countenem chads and all the core challenges, etc. Questions, Mount overfated to hit is our Cowies camp. Here's something you ought to be thinking about if you're in your car right now on a way to vote and you're like sitting on a fence or maybe even thinking to vote for the Eoneo cons again for the right wing Kaba. As the toll of Mayhem inspired by terrorist leader Abul Mubusha administration made a mistake once before the start of the war by stopping the military from attacking his camp in the northeastern part of that country. The Pentagon drew up detailed plans in June of 2002, giving the administration a series of options for military strike on the camp. The camp mysteries are Cowie was running then in remote northeastern Iraq, according to generals who were involved directly in planning the attack and several former White House staffers. They said the camp near the town of Kermal was known to contain mysteries are Cowie and his supporters as well as al-Qaeda fighters all of whom had fled from Afghanistan. Intelligence indicated the camp was training recruits and making poisons for attacks against the West. Senior Pentagon officials who were involved in planning the attacks said that even by spring 2002, Mr. Zarkoway had been identified as a significant terrorist target based in part on intelligence that the camp he early ran in Afghanistan had been attempting to make chemical weapons and because he was known as the head of a group that was plotting and training for attacks against the West. He already was identified as the ringleader in several failed terrorist posigins to Israeli and European targets. In addition by late 2002, while the White House was still deliberating over attacking the camp, Mr. Zarkoway was known to have been behind the October 2002 assassination of a senior mercenep med in Amman Jordan. But the right-and-misters are Cowie didn't take place. Months passed with no approval of the plan from the White House until work came down just weeks before March 19, 2003, started the Iraq War that Mr. Bush had rejected any strike on the camp until after an official outbreak of hostilities with Iraq, ultimately the camp was said just after the invasion of Iraq began. What have been bad timing see? What have really bad? What have messed up all their plans? Like Tessio said, you know, Mrs. Uppal my plans. Can't do it, Pally. So there you go. There's a little more insight as to why that guy still running around be care about. His mischamal and at 14 year old boy. He just wanted to be a father, a forever father life, forever father. He wanted to father him and mother him and brother him and... Nozzle. Who knows what? But what do you see? The people that I talked to who are obviously a little more in touch with the whole South Florida deal. Nobody that I know is in the least bit surprised about that whole story. Some of you are very naive because you see people on television and think, you know, I don't know what you think. He's on television. He's the weather fairy. I've been telling you to weather fairy for a long time. This is the one place where you heard it right here on his show. Because he's gay doesn't make him a child molester, which of course, that's all the more reason this is a grotesque story because it feeds that, you know, popular misconperception. All of them, Faggot's, they're its pedophiles, maybe they're child molesters. They all want to hop into sacwood and 14 year old little boys. None of them just the show business one. I see. That's what the Josh Cortes said. 560, 560, pound 560 and the Verizon and singular wireless lines. Yeah, maybe you can interpret for him when he is that conversation with your little buddy there. Don't laugh. WQAM hello. This is no tomorrow. Let me fit. Okay, great. WQAM hello. Nearly, nearly, nearly. Yes. Hey, man, the lines are incredible. Good. Excellent. It's going to be a landslide man.

What are we going to do about the old Cuban so, man? A date county. What's all we're going to do with them? Show them in the legs. He's a pirate. That's a very psychic day. Is it really everybody's in? It's in the leg. Oh, no. Just above the ankle. Okay. We don't want to do any serious permanent damage. Although if it's wasn't down and they got misroading, that would be good. Army unit not ordered to make Iraqi explosive surgeons, but all is so in the days that they're given you about the timing of this story and about the weapons weren't even really there and all is other crap. Well, guess what? The first US military unit to reach the elk. Oh, and I love the way people are pronouncing this. The last night. Yeah. Last night the guests on the Lou Dobs were saying, al-Kakah. But Lou Dobs was saying, kakah. And that's what he was saying. The first US military unit to reach the elk. Kakah, I'm going to introduce you to the followback that. I don't know what you're laughing about. The good enough for Lou Dobs on CNN is making probably $80 million here. It's good enough for me. He is so full of himself, man. He's full of it and he's full of himself. Like ain't Lou Dobs. Why do I watch that? I don't know. Can I get you this story, police? I got a great coming here. Is it a long break or a week break? A strong break? I tried to forget how prankens I now. If you want to hear some really insightful, we didn't to do the job. And this is one of the jobs that needed to be done this really. It's kind of like guarding those nuclear weapons. They're in the former Soviet Union, which I'm sure we're doing a fabulous job of that. 1213 at 5.60 WQA.

The Nevada turnout is spectacular too, because they had advanced voting. Everywhere they were, they had the early voting. It's just people are turning out in rules. And you want to know why? Because people are pissed off and fired up, baby. People are whipped up into a frenzy. The great, whatever it was supposed to be has split this country right down the middle. With all the dumb people on the one side and all the rest of us on the other side. In fact, Molly Ivan says, what a great lead in. Cool as people love Bush. You go, girl. Fuses owe you sweet innocent care precedes and non-swing states. You have no idea how much fun and slime you're missing. This is a dayline, St. Louis. In the swingers, Wolves stalk us mercilessly as the pro Wolflobby points out indignantly, no one has ever been killed by Wolves on US soil, but try arguing that in the face of the relentless new TV ad campaign. Breaking news everywhere. 380 tons of high explosives in Iraq left unattended. Stock market down the years low. Leading economic indicators down more tragedy in Iraq. The swift boat liars are back. More Haliburton scandal. George Tenon said the war in Iraq is wrong. It feels like you're dodging meteorites here in the final days. Actually, the best evidence who just we need to slow way down and go way back. Because far from being able to take in anything new, it turns out many of our felon effect been abandoned shortly after the 1st Gulf War. Bush and Cheney miss led the country into war using these two false premises and it turns out an enormous number of our fellow citizens still believe both of them to be true. It's not because they're stupid, but because an administration they trust is still telling them both, phony propositions are true. I'm not so sure it's not because they're right. Anyway, Molly Ivins says normally when you get a situation like that, where people are simply not acknowledging reality, it's considered a cult, a form of group thing based on irrational beliefs propagated by what is normally a charismatic leader. So those carry volunteers, earnestly engaging bush supporters on the latest outrage, our way off-face. They need to go all the way back to the two great lies that got us into this. Many American soldiers marching into a rack believed it was payback for 9.11. A third slightly blinding fact to me is that more people now think carry behaved chenclin regard to Vietnam than did W. Incredible. What brazen lying will do, isn't it? A friend of Bush's dad got him into the champagne unit of the Texas National Guard, a unit packed with the sons of the privilege trying to stay out of Vietnam, and he failed even to complete the service there. Carry is a genuine bonafide war hero, the men who served on his boat are supporting him for president, but those who didn't serve with him who weren't there who don't know what happened have been given more credence, wolves will get you. In further unhappy evidence of how ill informed the American people are, blame the media, the program on international policy study attitudes on bush supporters consistently ill informed about bush's stance on the issues. Carryins by contrast are overwhelmingly right about his positions. 7% of bush supporters in the key favor putting labor and environmental standards into international trade agreements 80% of bush supporters believe bush wants to participate in the treaty banning landmines. 76% of bush supporters believe bush wants to participate in the treaty banning nuclear weapons testing. 62% believe bush would participate in the international criminal court. 61% believe bush wants to participate in the Kyoto Treaty on global warming. 53% does not believe bush's building missile defenses them aka Star Wars. The only two bush stands the majority of a supporters got right were increasing defense spending and who should write the new Iraqi constitution. Carry supporters by contrast know their man on 7 out of eight issues with only 43% of his standing he wants to keep defense spending the same but change how the money is spent and 57% believe he wants to up it. So what's going on here? I don't think carry people are smarter than bush people so why are they better informed? Maybe a small percentage of ideological right wingers don't believe anything the established would be media say but I don't think it's a matter of not believing what they hear it but of not hearing what's factual. The great triumph of the political right in this country has been the creation of a network of alternative media. There are people listening to Rush Limbaugh for more hours every day than the branch of Indians listening to David Karesh. Watch Fox News read the Washington Times, hey that's what the bush administration does according to his own words. But it's not just the right wing media per veying lies they're quoting the administration. These misimpressions come directly from the bush administration still over and over. And they do they like crazy and they're a lot of I think she's wrong about the one thing the stupid part right right right right right right right right Not a stupid people out there Molly trust us we talked to a lot of them every day. Believe me.

Or wait a minute. For sure, it's a good as Eddie, I have a 40-year. Anyway, David Sunrise says, is an almost lifelong fan of you in your program. I ran across a how to use the valuable voting machines video. It originally came from an Instagram website that's got that in L, which means Needle-Lines, Nevilleans. Oh, no, no. Oh, gee, you hear Nevillean just talking about Catherine Harris playing crash. You oughta be fired? Yeah, guess what website I'm never ever looked at anymore. Nobody else with a brain ought to either. I don't know. Richard Melon's Schaith funded right wing piece of self-hating fat crap. The fudge report. I never, I think it enough my thing. It's off my thing. I never had. I want to read right wing propaganda. I can go to newsmax.com or something. I can get some real hallucinatory stuff. For Fox News.com. A silver Cadillac spread toward the group, but as Sarah showed an intersection last night, then swirled at the last minute before driving off according to police. Oh, my God. Witnesses gave the car as license plate number to police and they attracted to, very em-sulture, 46. And his brother Alka. He came to the police station today and complained to officers that Harris supporters had impeded traffic. You go, Barry. I intimidated him with my car, soldier told police. Otherwise he was just trying to move them, paying the S people, or impeding his way. Move him out of the way. Okay? Don't be so strong with that. Nothing. He was charged with aggravated the assault with a deadly weapon. A call for comment to Harris campaign secretary was not immediately returned. Harris, a civil-suit of Republican and one of the prime pictures of the 2000 election a miserable nasty bitch is seeking a second congressional term after serving as Florida's Secretary of State during the protracted 2000 presidential fixed race. And of course, when the neighborhood is making like I said yesterday, Catherine seemed like a piker by comparison, like a small potato. That's right. Nice job there, Glenn. Getting the Ralph Nader on a battle. I'm sure that was very, very ununpartisanly listed the way you know, make sure it's fair. Speaking of Ralph Nader, Tim Robbins was on one of the talking hits last yesterday, sometime. Just see him? Nope. Now, unfortunately, like Phil Donnie, he went some other very night. People back in 2000, Tim Robbins was a great guy and is coming from all the right places. He endorsed Ralph Nader, supported Ralph Nader and voted for Ralph Nader. This time he's spending all of his waking moments running around the country, speaking to other Native people telling him, don't do it again. Don't do it again. Don't screw us again. Like that song says that the Vspoir sings, screw us again. So that's what he's doing. That's his act. Join George and poker Brian today for happy hour five to seven at Treasure Island.

I will read it in the sound. I'm going to get bunch of calls. Yeah. Is it fully bedded? Also, I like this. This is from the Guardian. I wish we had the Guardian in the US instead of just in the UK. Yeah. And like somebody said, the internet's. But the internet's is where it be. You know, the same guy that said, Abu Garra. Rebe. He's the guy that told you, find a real crap on the internet's. Let's see. Steve says, You've got to check out this website. It's a hilarious game trying to give Bush a brain. Im gag.com. You're going to take a look at this also. Yeah. Why do you got a whole bunch of homework assignments there? Well, I'm doing these boring bedtime stories. And taking a few very, very important calls to, of course, that's our bread and butter. WQAM Hello. I don't know why you're coming down on Bill. Wow. You're not doing anything. Yeah. Reverend Jones. WQAM Hello. Hey, Uncle Neil. How are you doing? Pretty good, pal. I just turned the radio. I had to call you for two reasons. This is Virginia Key by the way. Oh, Virginia Key, hello. I actually converted a Cuban and got into vote for Kerry. Oh, my God. That is astonishing. The classic thing was actually being in the room. Actually, it could be across the room when I heard it talking to his mother on the phone. Yeah. And how many did you call this Cuban? Probably. He did. 4445. Right. And I could hear his mother screaming on the phone. Good. From the other side of the room. I can see, I'm seeing as a heart attack. And then she can't vote on Tuesday. I know I'm familiar with public enemy number one. Excellent. And to that idiot that calls you at the end of yesterday's show, which one? The one that the idiot that was saying, how come, you know, your liberal and how come games are liberal, and this and this and this. Hey, hey, buddy, why don't you go have a meeting of your house in log camera publicans and then give us a call, okay? Yeah, right. And by the way, log cabin Republicans are not endorsing bushless here. Even those right when you self-hating Fag gets something to it. How do you like that? You know what he should have them over for a wonderful little, he never over his knee is what he unhooked. Maybe over his rectum. Okay. Thanks, pal. Have a great day. Good job. Nice going. There's one of our people in it. We're building votes for Kerry one at a time. Once you're a QA, one shmuckin' sandwich board out there and like it road mall, where nobody speaks English anyway. I heard a rumor that I think you started it. Yeah. But all the traditional South Beach crowd that they're like all fleeing out of there since the hip hop crowd came moving in. Did I start that rumor? I don't know anything about that. I don't know who started that. I've been hearing that from a lot of people. That like even in the middle of a down a sunny day, like a noon that's getting really dark on South Beach. That's what I'm hearing. That was that true? I don't know. Or what do you mean you don't know? You used to watch the Amy? Yeah. See, that was the... Remember I told you that was their whole prime of the prime of the premise? The idea that, oh, South Beach, that's where it's at, Hall of South Florida. Whammy! Damn it's not. It sure did. We're still in the embarrassed and humiliated by it. Which goes to show you what a putts very diller is. But if all the people in the world would big money, he is one of the worst. He is one of the most idiotic schmucks. Very diller. I'd rather a work for Philistroiller. Don't be confused by the tide of contradictory voter surveys. Bush is in trouble, writes, mark, molotass, what is it? Molotsis. Mark molotsis was having blitzes for lunch right now in England somewhere in the Guardian UK. I'm not reading this because this is pretty interesting because a lot of people out there they're getting so buffaloed by these poles even if they live like in O'Neighana. They're getting buffaloed by the poles, and especially seeing them, which shows those gallop poles over and over again. Even a Massachusetts, I wouldn't be surprised before Tuesday, and at CNN, shows all of Bush's just moved ahead of Massachusetts. You're listening to Neil Roger. Ray Roberts, Riders, Nazi, and QAM. Is sending the newest version of Hooked Down Fonics. The all-new George Bush Fonics. Now with 30 easy to use computer games to make learning fun. That's why the fighting surface surface, it'll make it less likely. Less likely we have a financial accreion, financial f***. The IA is, and f***. If you send me next message, it's in this nature, so I protect American along, we're almost f***. They're there, they're jerkawing. And I'll be going on. I'll be going on. Ray, see you in prison in your child's reading in four weeks of your money back. It's a native to... Call now 1-800-ADF-ECD-EF-E-T. How 45-5-60? What was that F-E-G? Something? That's what I heard. And before that other story about, don't get all panicky, but these pools embedded reporters saw no explosive search. Ed. That was more of a pit stop there for us, and you know, the searching, I mean certainly some of the soldiers head off their on and their own, look through the buckers, just to look at the vast amount of ordinance lying around. But as far as we could tell, she said there was no move to secure the weapons, nothing to keep looters away. She told MSNBC that there was no talk among the 101st of securing the area after they left either. She said the roads were cut off, so it would have been very difficult, they believed for the looters to get there. So there's the latest in where this is that story, keeps expanding and embellishing and just getting bigger and bigger, like I'm gigantic mushroom. There's nothing like a gigantic mushroom, you know? They're good. Unless of course it turns out to be a toad, stool. Pigeon. Where to these is most interesting, that's our poll question. There we got six hundred and three votes. Tons of vanished weapons in Iraq, 213 one. Before we knew the poll result, I wanted to do it again. It's, it'll be pondered to some of the people, but it's very necessary that we do this. Because I think I finally stumbled in the answer to our starting at different times every day problem. And that is that those people have been kind of like put off by that and wondering what those go in on. You can tune in to love it a clock every morning. We would like you to tune in like it's six with Howard stars. But I mean, if you're one of those people that isn't a stern listener or you're here or there, whatever, you can tune in 11 and you won't miss so much. Hey, I miss some phone calls, but we're just going to take calls between whenever Howard ends. Not the last two days yesterday and Monday. It worked out perfect because they went on right to 11 o'clock. Which would be nice if they would do that every day. Although it's even nicer now that we can make appointments with colors for them to call between like say 10 30 or 10 35 and 11 o'clock. Right? Right. Yeah, you can make an appointment and we'll give you your own line. You can call in. We'll give you like five 10 seconds to weigh hang up on you. So that's a deal. So from 11 to two basically is the meat. That's the meat of the matter. That's the heart to guts, the bladder, the liver, the pancreas of the show. And the rest before that is like whatever case the rossera. And once in a while, if we don't get any phone calls, we'll drop in something really cute like. And if we really want to be like that, cutting edge like Al Franken. Anyway, which of these is most interesting to you, tons of vanished weapons in Iraq 234. Bill come all busted and fired 138. Recuperating Clinton on stump for Kerry 79, red socks may be world champs 73, humiliating Ashley Simpson lipstick on SNL. That's God. But third man. Dolphins finally win 126. Don't hold your breath for a repeat on Monday night. The NHL lockout 16. That just blows me away. You know what? That many people claim to be concerned about the hockey. The strange part, the year before 60, seeing times. Short as a flu vaccine nine and the patriots win their 21st and a row three. So you want to think about up here, we got hockey going until it's coming out of your Iraq. When he does, he comes back to Belgium. You see what I'm saying? We got hockey stuff going in 26 hours a day. Look at that. It's a certainly one. You see it. This election. It out there. What is the government of Arkansas? He's trying to deny because they just show the new pool, the state pool, 48, 48. And Bubba's going to be there on Sunday or Monday. In Arkansas. Put the carry over the top and get all end dark and collected people out of there too. We did do the break. Didn't we, we did. I just forgot to cross it all because I'm getting so far ahead of myself. Now that we officially have basically with the three hour show. Right. Right. That's fine. It's always 11.05 to me. So I don't even know what it is. Well, that's right. Now in other words, they still haven't got the new clock in there. Clarence can't even take care of that. He can't get my paychecks on time anymore, which I'm sitting in paradise crab. And we can't get a new clock in there for you. I wrote a little travel. That's a tremendous expense there for Beesley broadcasting, which is listed on the NASDAQ, which is supposedly a real responsible broadcasting company. A real honest, they got not just a salmon pop bunch of rednecks. And they can't even get a freaking clock in there. Look at that. Coodle oil is down to 5360 in that bargain. And the markets are up there again. 52 up on the Dow 20 and up on the NASDAQ. I wouldn't be surprised if they goose it up over 10,000 again. If they get their way, even though that consumer confidence yesterday was not good. Bad, bad, bad, bad. Now what tell us this? Frank in Melbourne says, what happened to Frank that was doing our electoral votes by the way? What happened to him? Remember him? I guarantee he's probably like a scared to do it now because... I thought the thing in the other day, that's the T. At least that's the day. That always the days ago. Okay. Days ago. You're stuck in the past, man. You better get with it. You didn't even know about bullying for soup. Who? Frank in Melbourne says, on Amendment 3, I'd like to point out what I think is the worst part of it. I don't want to go through all of this. I mean, Frank in Melbourne, I don't want to like, denigrate your facts and the time you took to write all of this, I mean, the public needs to remember a flag waving corp. Okay, just vote. No, I'm Amendment 3. Okay. Where are these we on now? We don't need to like make the case. On the eight amendments. Here's the answer to. If you two ladies you look at our website, we've got them all listed. There we have a link so we can read it in detail. I'll make up your own mind if you really are capable of doing that. Or if you just want to go with us, just go. No, no, no, no. Got it? Got it. Okay. Now, what was I just doing here? Don't be confused by the tide of capturing three voters surveys. Voices in trouble. This is by Mark Molitzus in the Guardian UK, which is a great publication. Everybody ought to be forced to read the Guardian UK. That left wing rag, we love it. With the week and you notice if there's like anything that's the left of a till of the hunt? Like occasionally CBS comes to like like leans over there because the heat bush like poison. And he's oh that's biased and it's that liberal media. But it's okay to have Fox on there 24 or seven. It's okay that CNN MSNBC are both attempting to be Fox light now, assuming that they're going to draw those viewers in which they never will. Hey, Fox is fair and balanced. Yeah, right. That's a remark, man. He never saw a fascist eating like. With a week ago, it says Americans are being inundated by poles. And most of them spend a lot of time bowling. It says at least 112 have been published for the presidential contest in last week alone. While it's tempting to look at the jumble or results in the clear polling hopelessly useless, the fact is poles have a great deal to tell us about the state of the race. And out of the way the people generally assume, now I want you to listen to this okay can you handle it? All right. He says poles are always reported as though there's a winner and there's a loser. So a pole showing bush leading 45 to 42 is headline Bush leads by three when a reality is that Bush is actually losing. In US elections, any elected official gardening less than 50% of the vote and polls is considered vulnerable as democratic polster mark Blumenthall notes, voters typically know and comeets well have strong opinions about their performance. Challenges are less from it. You're invariably fall short on straightforward comparisons of experience in the presidential arena command to foreign policy. Some voters find themselves conflicted. The satisfied with the incumbent, it also wary of the challenger and many carry that uncertainty to the final laser the campaign and sometimes write in the voting booth. Among the perpetually conflicted, the attitudes about the incumbent are usually more predictive of these conflicted voters final decision than they're lingering doubts about the challenger. Thus in the campaigns last hours, we tend to see undecided voters break for the challenger. Testing this theory, Blogger Chris Bowers examined presidential poll results in 1976 and calculated that undecided voters broke for the challenger 86% of the time. It's a dynamic that clearly weighs heavily on the Bush campaign, speaking to conservative bloggers at the Republican National Convention, Bush's poster Matthew Dowd said that 50% rolled into a plot of the president. Based on the polling data they've aggregated on undecided in battleground states, the Bush team has compiled the following profile on the side. They're overwhelmingly white, tend to be older, go to church often and describe themselves as moderate to conservative, doubt says they can't find any self-discrab liberals remain undecided. As a result, he's pretty guessing. Some get it right, some get it wrong, and have the time the luck is probably involved. That's why Spestal Look at polls in the aggregate, easy to do given the sheer number of them or at the obsessive of any special one. With that brief polling primer, anyone could take a look at the numbers and get a sense for these state of the race, and a strict by the numbers calculation shows that Bush is in serious trouble. In Ohio, Bush numbers range from 43 to 49% failing to break 50% any of the 12 Ohio polls. Indeed, in October, there are signs that Bush is essentially abandoned this state, working to build a selectal majority by 1 and 3 out of 4 in Florida, Iowa was constantly Mexico, but October polling in those states also shows an incompetent serious trouble. In 14 Florida polls, Bush hasn't broken 50% since the survey USA poll conducted between October 1 and 3. A subsequent survey USA poll now gives Carrie 50 to 49 lead in the state. In Iowa, single poll has an 51% while six others range between 46 and 49, which causes him to give him a crats heartburn, but Bush breaks 50% only one of the nine polls this month, two independent polls put him as far back as 43%. New Mexico has Bush in a 43 to 49% range, anemic numbers in the state that grow 1 by less than 1,000 votes last time. Much can happen in one week, and Republicans are doing their part to prevent a fear election, perhaps the Bush can't bullsewer if like any other stuff from the last 24 to 36 hours, but the missing explosives in Iraq, and those explosives are going to blow up all right, right in their pussy, you'll see. About 57 at 560 WC, I'm speaking a post if you look in the mirror at your ugly pussy, see that big glaring ball spot. It doesn't make you look at a younger, any better, it makes you look nasty and old as what it does. Well Charles Ophiric can help you make you look great because he's been helping the famous and not so famous look their best for about 30 years now. But third man, that is correct. It wouldn't even recognize Charlie's work when you see it because it doesn't look like a piece. The most critical area of any here system is that hairline and Charlie's new skin like her system is 100% un-detectable. That's right. The hair looks like it's grown right out of your scalp. And Charlie's work is completely guaranteed, you have nothing to lose, but that ugly glaring ball spot, because you try Charlie's system for a month about 30 days. 30 days and after a month of year, all of the way looks in the fields and smells, if you're not getting laid like at least 20, 30, 40 times a day. Just say hey, I want my money back, here's your hair, Charlie didn't work. I'm sure that won't happen though. Make that call today. Tell Charlie, heard about it here on the Neo-Warge show and get your special QA. I'm $200 this time off the regular $800 price of that natural hairline system. 1-800-321-2413. Don't forget the secret to a great hair system is make sure that nobody can tell you're wearing one and Charlie's new skin like her system is as natural as it gets. 1-800-321-2413, run that wicked web. It's Charles Alfie or E.com. You're listening to Neil Rogers. The Red Star is on the plastic surgery. QA-AM. Here's a facts from a can who says, Speaking of Katherine Stupid bitch Harris, he's got a website, A.L. Uh, yeah, a link. Links to a story about a C-SPAN camera picking up her and fellow Weasel Republican representative Rick Renzi, connoodling in the background while Republican Rob Simmons delivers a speech on a floor. The video goes on for a few minutes while these two married fools Renzi has 12 kids, court each other in a background, too bad though, the video stops right as it looks she's ready to do um, f*** on him. I don't want to read that. Rubber double. Rubber double on him. Wow, what did you take a look at that? How about these other things you've been looking at? Another, the Bush brain thing is up and it works just fine and done. Right. You should play test your skill and the other is going up as we speak and I'm checking this one out. This is daily cost.com which is a great website. We love that one. We love daily cost.com. Do we not? Yes. Here's see and I was no sooner than I asked her Fred and here's his facts. Boy, you people sometimes when you least expect her way to man you right on top of it. Subproclaimed exclusive Neorodgeshow poster Fred would one week to go says, he has carried winning 289 to 249. Now let me just take a puke because I know a lot of people out there are very lazy. All of some people aren't sitting at a computer right now. Some people don't have access to a computer and some poor slippers out there don't even own a PC which is very, very unacceptable at this point. We think it's unacceptable. Bush's Iraq is a dangerous place. Ha ha ha. Man. Maybe that's why we hit all those people by when he told Pat Robertson there was going to be no casualties. Maybe he didn't realize it was a dangerous place you think? It's possible. That might have been it. What is the Bush getting you took it for you? Now important prescription drug coverage. So we're searching drugs for being a carnival part of the mancare plan. Oh, that is beautiful. Now how do you, now let's see. I see you have to click it to try to drop the brain right. Right. Oh, they don't keep you busy. It'll keep you up the streets for hours today, man. Give that to ourselves department. And don't forget about management such as it is. Okay, now what I was going to do and how do I got to stop that? Jesus. Okay, I lost. I couldn't get a brain in his head. Then we got M&M's Mosh video, which is great. And then I'm looking. Look and look at here. Where's our thing? There's no no no yes yes yes yes yes yes. Here's the electrical footprint to try. I know what it was. And I'm just trying to compare. Which it wasn't really good news for the carry people this morning. That it's not the administration's fault. And he even criticized those who raised the subject. Anyway, it shows Bush 274 and the carry 257. But also this one gives Bush Ohio, which he's acquired their latest pull two points And Florida, which it shows him four points ahead, which both are certainly up for grabs. It also shows Arkansas here for Bush six points ahead, but the latest pull beyond this shows it 4848 did even. And this one also still shows the Bush up point out why there is no way there's the Chinaman's chance in Honolulu that he's going to win Hawaii. They've only had two pulls off here since the point started. Ain't going to happen baby. So it's a dead tight. Anyway, here's what Fred says. Did you get that? He says he has carried winning 289 to 249. And we'll let him go. Many states have moved it down competitive now like Louisiana, Arizona, Missouri, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. Perhaps they were not competitive from the start. Anyway, they're no longer in play. He says I still refuse to concede New Mexico. North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia and the Bush may looks like he'll take those four. Finally, the battleground or toss up states, any of these could go either way if sent perhaps Pennsylvania and Hampshire, which looks solid for Kerry. Block solid. As is Nevada for Bush, I'm not so sure about that from what we're hearing from Nevada today, but never less. It says the other six are truly too close to call, even including Arkansas where bubble will be in a few days. He also says what that was up with Iowa and Wisconsin. Both Gorsdates last time that Kerry's having a hard time closing too many white folks there, I believe he says. Although if you look at Iowa and Wisconsin, I like Wisconsin Minnesota on the electoral map, the tracking map we've got on our website. Today, finally, Kerry ages back ahead in both Wisconsin and Minnesota and they've got Iowa even Steven did even flatfoot. He also says Fred C. does. I have carried winning all three big states, not just switched full thinking unless Jeb and the hood get in there and mess around again. It's looking like Kerry should win the three big inch allowed is Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Well, we'll see six days to go, man. The pressure is so great. Can I almost let go? Let's get in a few thousand calls. 567.0.560 pound five 60 on these Verizon and Singular Wattess lines. WQAM hello. Hi, Neil. Yes sir. Hi. Just wanted to let you know there's an option for this website real clear politics dot com. Nope. It's really an excellent one. And breaks it down by state, state by state. You can see all the polls of the past and the new polls. Really, really clear politics dot com. Right. And you go to the undersided states and then breaks it right down there. It's very good. Well, what are they showing now? They got a total. Ah, yeah. They have a total and they have all the different polls. You know, all the different ones from who does Watt poll. And you kind of get a trend in the sea, who's favorite in Bush and which one's favorite. Kerry. Right. That's kind of interesting. Yeah. And they asked guys think about ways they're going to try to steal it. I was thinking, is there a way they can steal through the electoral college at the election done? Well, yeah, because there's one elector in West Virginia who says he won't vote for Bush no matter what, he's going to vote for Kerry. And then a Colorado that thing is on a ballot, which for the life of me, I don't see how they can pass that and then enforce it in this election. Right. But I think we're going to try to. Or they proportionally give out the electoral votes like they do in Maine. And if that happens, that could be pretty interesting. If it's really as tight as people think that could change all election. Yeah. And now, get the election. Well, election was going to try to do that. Wouldn't we, everything was up in the air down here. Whether or not he's still trying to get their own electoral electorate and up there no matter what happened. Well, no matter what happened, Bush was going to win. Now, his brother was going to win last time. He called him on a phone until it don't worry the fixes in. Yeah. Yeah. No. So no matter what it took, whether they had a bribe, a clearance Thomas or give him some good weed or whatever it took. Now, that was then they did it. Yeah. I like Pally early and often thanks for the website. Realx. What is it real clear politics dot com? Do you check that out? No. Well, I will do in a break. Well, that's not up your alley. But that literally is there's not any cartoons. What? I'm downloading that canoodle video. Oh, the canoodle one. Let's get all of this stuff on there. Okay, keep people really busy. It's after all Wednesday already. We just got a few days left. Haven't seen six days. Is it five? Six. Three. Two. Two. One. Yes. Yes. You know. How many QAM? Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Is this George? Yeah. Hey, George. I have a quick question. Listen up. I'm getting ready to revoke. Right. And I was told that if I don't vote on each candidate, be it, you know, a senator or whatever the case may be, my, my ballot would be, uh, that is entirely a lie that is untrue. Okay. You, you could go there and just vote for president if you want. Good idea, but I mean, you could just vote for anyone. If you wanted only vote for the Senate, you have to vote near be raised. That's idiotic. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Do a good job, pal. Bye. See, there you go. People, people, I don't know anything about voting. I'll make up all of this. Cravenous poor guy or you got to vote near be ready. You don't have to do that. There are many people that just vote for president, which we certainly want to vote for Betty Castro for senator, right? Right. Because we got to hang out of that Bobby Graham seed. Keep in mind, that's not a seat that the Democrats can gain in Florida. That's when they try to hang on to. And that, actually, suddenly, the newfound right wing fanatic Mel Martinez, who would have held needs his crab, okay? So while you people have to go to vote for carrier or whatever you're going to vote, I mean, we got to get Betty Castro in there. And also those amendments, especially number four, because I'm a degenerant. I want to slot machines in there at the race tracks, especially a pop and a park, but all of them. And all that money for education, which has to be new funds for education. Well, by the way, tonight the 649 lottery here is 22 million George. So have a good time. All right. What are you laughing about? I came with, oh, I still can't get over that. The timing would have been so perfect, but my luck, you know, that would have been so great to have that number 13 instead of 14. That's what Bill Cummals are too. Just didn't work out. Simon says, I walked out of Broward County, courthouse with the powers to be looking for 58,000 absentee ballots. Oh, God. Hey, we got it under control, baby. What's a few hundred thousand missing ballots here in there, among friends, right? Right. It's going to be, you think the last time was really, wow, oh, because because that was basically down to Florida. And by that time, everybody else had fixed the, the fix was already in. But now you got to Ohio and you got Florida and you got Minnesota and you got Wisconsin, and even got maybe Hawaii by the time those votes come in five, six days after. On real. Pumma to 10 to one at five, 60, W. If you have an S, why we got all this inspectors like the guy to call us in the first hour there. From all over the world, like it were like where a tenth world country, we have thousands of people coming into inspect the elections to see if the United States of America can hold an honest election on be livable.
