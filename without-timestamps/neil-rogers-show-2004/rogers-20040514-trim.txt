Harry Sarner was there smoking and drinking. Drinking and smoking. Not any of that trade food. I'm sure. I don't know. We all have witnesses about that. And the bad news is that he got back safely from the York. I just plain didn't crash. Well, we wouldn't want to plane to crash because a lot of innocent people would have been done. Probably on a good people. Right. So we'll find some other way for Gary. I'm sure. So in any way answered all your questions that you were asking during the open there. Does he really? He does. And. And wait, he's got a waterload of the microphone. That's a long trip for him. Come on. Let's go. A cue ball. Joe's out here because Goldie has his charity golf event today. Joe is hanging out with Goldie. Yes. Maybe he ran the herald this morning. Maybe. Goldie was there last night. Who's too. Our pretty and tight. I'll take it as they are. Joe Rose and Kelly. And I'll take it as a break. Oh, I know. I know that. I know that. You're going to get an answer. No, I wasn't asking you a question. No, he's just a babbling. Sorry. But why do we have Tom Jick on here? Because any K is going to be doing Hank's lot. By the way, Dave Johnson will be calling that 11. We'll give you the winners in the pre-gnist again. Just like I did in the derby. But why do we have Tom Jick on here? Is that the best we could do? And why do we have the big. Oh, on this morning. Oh, my goodness. With Mo and a big O. That is painful. What's the answer for that beast? Look, he doesn't that one. The Omo show. Isn't one Omo enough? I'm a home. Anyway, let's cut the crap. Some Sentinel has a nice error on their sports section. At least on their website. I don't know about it in the newspaper. It says sharps and flyers when playoff series game three. Yeah. I actually went to bed. I didn't watch the rest of very boring sharps. Calgary flames game last night. Charms one three nothing. But the flyers did not win game three. They got beat by 10th of a very, very solidly four to one. They got walloped. nicely. Ice going lightning, baby. So here's the Sun Sentinel once again. Showing their ass to the world. We'll have Tom Jick on tonight. At the 10 o'clock right after the Marlins game at St. Louis. There'll be Philan for 80K. Philan for 80K was Philan for Hank. Who is not going to be on because Joe Rose was a guilty's government. So Jeldi wasn't going to be on. So we had the big. Oh, what a mishmash man. That's one of the problems with his radio station. That nobody ever knows who else going to be on. What's your number one complaint? It was our pull question yesterday. Probably should have put that in there too. What the hell is the lineup? A QA met the only station in America that's got you can pencil in the lineup. 1971 votes. What's that all about? Pretty heavy duty total. Would you say it?

My wife isn't bisexual 68. South Florida driver 65 the American media sucks 55 and we know that's. That's a lootly correct. I live in Florida 47 pretty bummed out about that. Mohour David had still on the Air 46. My boss is a pull 33. How about my bosses and emotional cripple? That's the case here at QAM. Our boss is an emotional cripple who needs his we team and now to come him down this morning. Muff is in their spoon feed into him right now. Come on Greg. Have another. Come on. Come on. Here you go. This a coming down. Give him some doggy downers. Okay. Man. What an emotional cripple. What a lunatic. I have no line. Get a wife Greg. Doggy bug me. The homeless voice 18. O.J.

It's a big thing of things happening. Very jackass writes in a hurled this morning. He says WQM is considering pairing Steve Gully Geldstein. With Joe Rose 8 to 10 AM. Weakday speaking of joint at the last. Currently team with Howard David at 5 to wait. And Goldstein said he's speaking with Panther officials about the team's vacant radio play by play job. Alright. Let me just. Can I interject one thing about Joe's McDonald? There's another one with no like. Get a life, Joe's okay. Quit emailing to Rimmer. All kinds of rumors. Our needle is ripping you and how come you're going to lunch with him? Because I'm buying. That's why which I did. Although the goodness is Rimmer only had a bowl of Montevall soup. Because they didn't have his kishki. Oh, so I lucked out. And he actually reached for where his wallet was supposed to be. Oh, I don't think it was really in there. You really saw his on moves. So go up, Jogs. Okay. And quit being a dotting old fool like like Mohour David. Alright. You already retired just sit back and enjoy life. Go out and play some golf model around. Anyways, as meanwhile, WQM is considering we hiring Joe Costello to work on Howard David's morning show. Wow. Poor Joe. The Mojo show. The station fired him in co-host Mark Eisenberg from their late night gig earlier this year when Internet picture surface of them fully clothed with naked women in WQM studio. Right. It's very jackass. Indianapolis Sportscaster Dave Benz. Formally of Wami, 69 in Miami, remains suspended and definitely by station yesterday. After helping the heat market in department can access to the Colts locker room at the, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Of course he wants work. Once upon a time works for Wami. Do you have any idea who that is? Wami. Got it sucks. So that's a, huh? Beast does. Who's the Dave Benz. He was on their sports desk show. I heard he does the deep knee. Benz. This is what I heard. Nobody cares about him. Nobody cares about Wami. No speaking in place. There are any more either. Another one of those spik stations. So that's the LA this done at. That was our poll result. That's the very jackass column. Which is much to do about nothing. We like Joe Custellable. That's all I'll say about that. We'd like to have him back on here. That's all I'll say about that. As far as him working with more well. You know, I wouldn't wish that on Hitler. But it's a paycheck. No, it's a paycheck. It's a paycheck. As far as guilty being hours. Joe Rose. I'm a little bit skeptical about that. Because even though I know they just love each other like crazy. Uh, Joe did just great in that last book yet. A 5.3 share in the eight o'clock hour. A 5.3 share in the nine o'clock hour. In other words, no matter how you figure it, he did a 5.3 hit a big book. Nice going Joe. Little dog. Blockhead. So why would you again? Why would you think you were around when you got a guy that's doing so great? How much is signing a contract with a guy and putting him on a payroll? That would be good Greg. Another net just leave the hell alone. Quit dittling and dittling and dittling man. He just never leaves bad enough alone. Did we just have a great book? There's a what the hell's it probably? Leave it alone already. Put Joe on there with mull and then leave a guilty go do the panther games. Like guilty go hang out at Jugs House. Which is a good idea. By the way, I'm hearing rumors about how much money guilty is making you. I don't dare tell you even off the year. I don't you would you'd never be the same again. Whatever. No no. You would not say well. I'm used to it. Now trust me. All right. What we got behind the beaded curtain today. Lisa Bonne. See. She's not one of my favorite looking people. I'll tell you that. Nevertheless. Nevertheless. She's like she was born November 16, 1967. If you got 75 pieces of ID, you can take a look at it. Right there behind the beaded curtain on the arages.com.

But she's also sometimes credited as Lisa Bonne. Never Bonne, Moroni. Look. And sure if that fanny. No Lisa Bonne. I don't think we can even say that.

And then, not that, the big of a deal. Anyway, so there she is. She's on our website if you really desperate. Just keep your hands under the above. I mean above the table, under your knees. Now, we have to do the break. Got a lot of heavy duty stuff here today. Here's today's poll question. I don't, there was something I inspired me to do this. I don't know what it was. I don't think we ever did this one, exactly. This way. I don't know. No, we just recently did the one about the worst. None. The worst. Chain. None fast food. Remember that? That was the last food thing we did. I think years ago we did something along these lines. Maybe we say. Well, let's do it again now. They all forgot. Because it's a list. Oh no, got for it. Jason's not there in four is it's Sean? That's Sean. For Sean and is the beast going to be hanging in there or what? He's hovering. He's hovering as long as there's food going to be coming around. The beast will remain. We're more I'm hearing is that he sucked up lots of food at that party last night. That's what I'm hearing. We all are very sarnetful. My good close personal friend Yuri Sarner. Who's a schmuck? Here's today's pool. What's the best sit down? No fast food restaurant and software to today. We're not talking about restaurants from a hundred years ago. The famous we've done those a million times. Open today. Open for business. The best sit down. No fast food. I put down roots. Chris. That's what I started with. And it can be any category. We're not going to be like while steak houses on Monday and Italian on Tuesday. That would be ridiculous.

You'd use to the torture cause we're just playing their game in the past. It had to be worse with the dumb who's saying. 10-17 at 5-60, WQAM. Now somebody's lying. We want to suggest that your government would lie to you because that would make you very cynical. We don't want you to do that. That would be bad. You've got to believe everything your government tells you that would never lie. They're good people. They're there because they want to take care of us. They want to work for us. Take care of our business. Why would you doubt that? But somebody's lying because diplomats email showed that Nick Berg was in custody. A US diplomatic official in Iraq told a family of Slain American Nicolas Berg that he was being detained by the US military when they lost contact with him for several days in early April. According to emails provided by the family yesterday, they got the emails there. They are right there. US government officials, though, have said Berg who was found dead last week in Iraq that was detained by a wrecky police and was never the custody of American forces. How do you like that? So who do you believe you believe your government? Only if you're a moron, only if you're a total moron. He has believed him in kidnapped within days of his release by either a wrecky police or coalition forces, and later be headed by militants who videotaped the slain as we all well to know. Bad. To back its claims that Berg was in US custody, the family showed the associate of press and April first email from Beth A. Paine, the US consular officer in Iraq. Who said? I have confirmed that your son Nick is being detained by the US military in Mosul. He is safe. He was picked up approximately one week ago. We will try to obtain additional information regarding his detention and a contact person you can communicate with directly the email said. And two emails later that day, Paine wrote that she was still trying to find local contact for the family. Berg's brother David Berg called on the government to come clean about its contacts with a slain American before he died. The family is blamed the government for keeping an custody for too long while anti-American violence escalated in Iraq. In other words, he could have gotten out when it was good, but they didn't let him because they were holding him. Now they said, we didn't have him. Well, if they never had him, how could they have offered him that free ride home? Whatever that was their story a couple of days ago. Now they're saying they never had him in custody. Right? Right? Are you doubting again? Yes. Because your government lies to you, Democrats lie, Republicans lie, in the pendants lie, Ralph Nader lies, the green people lie, the purple people lie. All the lies all the time am I right? Absolutely. You lie? Yeah, you bet. Just like if I were to tell you that I worked for like a real radio station. Oh man, that wouldn't be, that would be like a sick joke, not a lie. Now speaking of sickness, New York Post today, there's all kinds of stories, the new inquiries I'll tell you, please know that. We got the MS on the John Vanne Killer who committed suicide, the real killer, now that, what's his name? What is his name? What's his name? Daddy, he's running for Congress of Michigan. Oh, I thought, did you know that? I don't know, but I have no idea. No, Patcy and John Ramsey. And that is he? I guess? I don't know, I'll decide that out of mind. I haven't even talked about them a long time. We want to apologize, in fact, you ought to apologize because you've been playing at nasty. He made time for me to open the hall. He made time when he took me up in the hall. See, now come to find out that the real killer is committed sausage, it says the inquiry, and the inquiry don't make mistakes for you often. But we'll get to that eventually. Iraq's feared Abu Graib jail was one big sex rom sometimes by candlelight with an audience watching you as troops said yesterday. Your girlfriend, she was real busy. Sex and booze were commonplace in soldiers frequently set up candle at rooms for a voyeuristic sex shows, and a soldier who served at the set of soldiers served the notorious prison. There were lots of affairs, there was all kinds of adultery and alcoholism, and all kinds of crack going on. Said Dave Bishal, a national guardsman with the 870th military police unit, who returned home from Abu Graib last month. There was a bed found in one of the abandoned buildings, there was a mattress on the ground that had chairs all circled around it, and candles all over the place said Bishal adding that chairs were obviously for an audience. Maybe Alex Bennett was there. They had a live studio audience. The soldiers said the ex-witted liaison said the prisoner made easier by its maze-like layout, and that other troops frequently turned a blind eye to what their pals were up to. One of the female soldiers supposedly had sex in a gang bang said Terry Sto and MP from California, from time to time things like this would happen, a gang bang. The horse Virginia did it at all turn. News of the shocking sex campaigns in the controversial lock-up come as a friend of the disgraced reserveist Lindy England last out into the fence yesterday saying, Tates are having sex in the prison where personal or her and her boyfriend with whom she is in love. Right. Congress members of huge shocking new pictures of recently Iraqi jails at England appeared in a sick-o video, having sex in front of prisoners in Abu Graib and that she was stat in graphic sex acts with other US soldiers. But one family friend and sister the Racy V. Ziris had sex only with her boyfriend's, a specialist Charles Granger, one of six others from the 372 military police company facing charges for the abuse and that the pair are madly in love. He said the ex-rated tapes have been taken from their foot lockers. We were all amazed by this, he only had sex with him said Kenny Flanagan was known England since childhood. The pregnant England who's now stationed at Fort Bragg North Carolina met Granger 35 of divorce father of two, shortly before the Paris Merlin based unit was posted to a rack. At this particular article about, it's, Granger is charted because there's more. I already smicked it, but I'm going to dig it out of the trash. They want about the inquiries to it because it says that she's pregnant but very likely not by him. You following that? Yeah. Well, you haven't had a little gang bang. Maybe they were having like a little Sodom. And they could have a morey povichou just done. What's wrong with a little Sodom? You know, a little Sodom wouldn't, but Sodom might. A. Granger is charted with overseeing numerous abuses of Iraqi prisoners in Paris and several photos of the on private living at Himalayas and Iraqi captives. Another soldier involved in a scandal, specialist Jerry Jeremy Sivitz told Army investigators, Granger would mock the detainees and brutalize them. The LA Times reported last night. In one incident, he allegedly punched the detainees so hard he knocked them unconscious as eyes were closed. He wasn't moving. Sivitz was quoted saying, afterward Granger shook his fist and said, damn that hurt to report said. Sivitz, who the paper said is expected to plead guilty at a court martial proceeding next week, also disputed England's claim that she was ordered to post for the snapshot that shocked the world. One picture showed her holding an ikka-diracchi men on a dog leash and in the others, she shown making thumbs-up signs in front of a pyramid of ikka-diracchi men and putting at the generals of an ikka prisoner. Sivitz at England was laughing at the different stuff that they were having to detainees do. He also shocked on her claim that the soldiers were ordered to abuse the prisoners and said, Granger warned him not to tell a higher-ups about how they were being treated. Our command would have slammed us if it said. New photos and videos revealed by the Pentagon to lawmakers and private doing Wednesday showed attack-daw sterling at countering prisoners, Iraqi women forced to expose their breasts, and they could prisoners forced to have sex with each other. I better get the other one out of the trash. Because you are sure when he heard a lot more about Lyndy England, I'm all they are people to the villagely, banging. But MSNBC reports, photo-made show intelligence officers in charge. So in other words, somebody again may be lying here. I realize that's very hard for you to stomach because most of you folks aren't used to having people in charge, people in authority, people with uniforms on a liety, like police and military government officials, things like that. A abusive treatment of the supervision of military intelligence officers may have been intentionally used as part of the interrogation of Iraqi captives at the Abograe Prison According to a previously unpublished photograph of US soldiers, another personnel obtained by NBC News, have you seen this one? It's on our website. No, go there. The photograph was taken during the interrogation of several Iraqi prisoners who are depicted naked in a heap on the floor, according to a military police officer, faces a court martial, a connection with the alleged abuses at the notorious facility on the outskirts of Baghdad, the officer, again its Charles Granger of Green County, Pennsylvania, is leaning against the wall of the photograph, which is provided by his attorney, guys, Walmart. Granger identified for their soldiers in the photo labeled numbers 4, 5, 7, 8 in the copy of the private NBC News as military intelligence officers, when we said we're in charge of interrogation at the prison, a civilian translator's labeled number 2 in Granger's number 1. The involvement of military intelligence officers encouraging obesity trainees is emerged as a central question of the burgeoning scandal. Representative John Merthodim, a member of Pennsylvania, said last week that Granger had his photo taken with prisoners as proof that military intelligence officers force him to take part in abusive behavior. And of course, on and on, you can read the entire story of very long story of like nine pages, okay? Long story. There's the picture, okay? Which I'm sure that most people are much more interested in looking at the picture. Right. Where is it?

Absolutely. WQAM. Hello. You weigh them. Thank you. WQAM. Hello. Uh, Ruben. Ruben? Ruben? Ruben's cafe. Ruben? It's on commercial and federal highway. A Ruben can't find it?

I forget about that. That's Ruben Jones. 5.670560. I thought it was him. And I thought, why he's actually seeing the name of a place. Don't even put it on there. Okay. Don't even dignify him with a response. WQAM. Hello. Yes. I have an entry for the pole. Yes. My suggestion would be to use MAMBO Chombo. It's a Latin American cafe. They have one in Western and one in Cull Springs in there. Their fabulous presentation is good. It's not just the one for beans and rice. They're really good. They're great. I hate a lump of beans and rice. So it's certainly beefed that. Is it MAMBO Chombo, MAMM and B.O.J.A.M? J.A. M.B.O. Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. Okay. Friends, soldier and prison love child scandal. Is one of the prisoners the father of the child she's carrying? This is in the inquiry. No. The female. The female U.S. soldiers become a symbol of the torture, readie, Iraq's oboe grave, prison is also the center of a shocking love child scandal. Oh my God. HeFC, Linda, England, 21, son of photograph smiling in 20 and naked Iraqi prisoners, worked at the prison to be a close-to-where lover, specialist Charles Greiner, who's thought to be the father of the child she's he's expecting, but there's a big button there, okay? Correct. Don't say it. But sources of toldy inquiries exclusively that there's speculation among guards serving in the prison that she may have had sex with an Iraqi prisoner in the Hukud be the father of her child. On May 7, England, who is more than four months pregnant was shard by the military with assaulting the detainees, conspiring to mistreat them, meanwhile, Granger was said to have relish supervising the brutal treatment of Iraqis as well as posing himself in a dominating attitude over prisoners forced into humiliating positions. When England was present they delighted and sexually humiliating Iraqis while carrying on hot love-and-pre-themselves, a military source toldy inquire. Other guards say they often sneak off to have sex and it seemed to fuel their delight in pushing naked Muslims to tears, desperation and near insanity. They talked about being engaged, but no one was sure that that was true after sex in the prison barracks, they'd return to humiliate naked prisoners. He sneered at their distress, she took her cues from him, they were both amused at her treating a prisoner like a dog, leading a moron on a leash. There was a strong tinge of a rauticism underlying their cruelty they were getting off on this stuff, but they were shocked when the scandal broke back home. And just when they thought things couldn't get any worse, she told him she was pregnant and being sent back to the US away. They? Many of the prison guards were breaking the law and convinced they were getting away with it, one of them was known to be having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner who wanted special favors. There were also questions of whether England was having sex with an Iraqi prisoner who could be the father of the child she's carrying, she definitely had an eye for some of the better looking guys being let around naked. She had an eye for the good looking Iraqi guy. Satan's so litty. England who was married in divorce before she was 21 real trailer trans, worked at a chicken processing plan of West Virginia in 110 pounds to become a meteorologist. It's the weather lady. Green is friend and union town PA neighbor Tom Zavato told the inquire Charlie spoke to my daughter about two months ago and told her that he and Lindi were planning on getting married. Charles and Lindi decided to wait and see when they'd be returning home before making any wedding plans. The military source added England and Granger have brought dishonor and disgrace to our funding men who are being killed gets pregnant and nobody seems to know quite for sure by whom. Nobody knows quite for sure by whom. This love child scandal is just part of an ongoing mess that's bringing on this honored or hard press troops. The other military and started told the inquire there's absolute fear of the highest levels that this love child could be the product of England and Iraqi prisoner of war only future DNA test will absolutely prove that the child is Granger's or not as the case may be. My God, your breath, our beautiful son of a shield. Gildy Young's Dean stars as Big Mackey. I've got none to say to you, Matt. You're a bad man. A very bad man. I'm gonna point your face on the snowy. I don't want to keep it on the rat. See? I don't want nobody know what we're on there. To be my career. Good, good. Hey everybody. Captain. Important people. You can have your joes. Okay, you can have your crabs. They got that blue liquid, by the way. It's real good for that stuff. Keep up the good works as this facts are and keep. I love this expression as he keeps speaking the truth with candor. Well, I may speak the truth, but certainly not with candor. Who's taking it? I'm gonna start lying a lot. Seems to be the deal. Let's lie like crazy. Oh, look at Catherine Harris. Look what just happened there. 560, 050, 560, 080 and 10 Verizon. Catherine Harris just had a remissive bed BM. WQN, hello. Hi, talking to you. Speaking. Neil, good morning. How are you? Pretty good. How are you doing? Good. Thank you. Isn't it interesting that will do you agree that the current administration is in a bond with respect to the prison? The Ask Go. Do I agree? Am I in a debate? Well, given that, do you not also agree that they need to divert the attention? Well, my, my, my, why do you keep saying you not to agree? Do you have not also agree? I mean, I mean, you can say whatever you want, but does do I have to agree? No, you know. Okay. Isn't it interesting that these guys are supporting? They'll makeburg rather than when the Muslims take credit for and are supposed to be hailed in heaven or wherever the hell it is? Right. Do something like that? Yeah, when they go to the early gates, they're for all those virgins waiting for them up there. How they're going to recognize them? Well, then why is it that two days later? The administration claims that they know who it is that was the hooded man who killed me. Well, sir, how we end? Of course, we also have reports that he was already killed months ago. So, you know, just like chemical Ali, some of these guys, he come back more over and over again like Jesus. You know, what I think that it was the administration who did it. Somehow, if somebody had to do it to divert the attention because of the attention. There's an article on our website. There's an article on the website that I read yesterday that about the whole deal that pretty much says the same thing. I didn't realize that. I looked it up. Okay. Thanks. Thank you, sir. I mean, we don't want to get too carried away. But the timing series offers strange and the fact that they lied about whether or not they had him in custody. So, it didn't really stinks there. And then, of course, they leaked out this stuff about well, you know, he was on the same bus in Oklahoma with Zacharias, Masawi. And he let him use his password to get into his computer to check out the email. And his password was found on Zacharias's ass. And all of these things, see? So, right away, let's start turning around. Let's start ripping Nick Berg and let's start ripping the Berg family. Let's, it's always the same crap. But the timing of the whole thing certainly was very, very bizarre and peculiar, wasn't it? Although it doesn't seem to be working, does it? And then, of course, you've got these clowns out there saying, well, you know, if the media would spend as much time exposing these barbarians who are decapitating our mind young Americans. And don't you think he's talking about that? Thank you, Panky. There were those prisoners in Abu grade. And then we'd have a little bit of parity there, you know. You see how important it is for us to be there, see what kind of people they are and why we need to be there. Right, exactly. Why we shouldn't be there. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly the reason why we should not be there is a matter of fact since you mentioned that, I'll use this story right now. Outrageous kiss player mouths off on the Muslims, Gene Simmons, who spent last night at the holiday in Express. Yes. But nice Jewish boy. I don't believe it. Kiss. Born in Israel's matter of fact. Had those, you know that? No, I did not. Gene Client in Israel. What is it? Gene Client is Israel name. Right. Are you start with your anti-Smanthesis again? Probably remember the kiss army, thank you very much. Kiss based player, Gene Simmons is caused an upper among Australia's Muslim community by launching an attack on Islamic culture while in Melbourne. The lizard town rock god who is touring Australia with the world's most enduring glam rock band, Lutz and attack on Muslim extremist during an interview on Melbourne's 3AW radio including comments which were labeled inaccurate. Extremism believes that it's okay to strap bombs onto your children and send them to paradise, paradise. And whatever else in the behead people is said yesterday. Absolutely. The Israeli-born US musician, when on the SA Islam was a vile culture that treated women worse than dogs. Muslim women had to walk behind their men and were not allowed to be educated or own houses. You said, your dog, however, can walk side by side. Your dog is allowed to have its own dog house. You can send your dog to school to learn tricks, sit, bag to all of that stuff. But none of the women had that advantage. He went on to say the West was under threat. But what's wrong with having your wife being taught to do tricks and sit and bag into all those things? Yeah, totally. This is a vile culture we said. If you think for a second that it's going to just live in the sands of gods, armpit, you've got another thing coming. They want to come and live right where you live and they think that you're evil. Evil! 7 said that you went approached did not work and at the West had a speak softly and carry a big stick. The radio station fielded calls from Muslims upset at the comments, including us ready in Muslim of the year, Susan Carlandous, that us ready in Muslims rejected extremism, had did not fit 7 stereotype. Ms. Carland said she had two degrees was doing her honors and certainly did not walk behind her husband. Behind her husband's behind. Chairman of the Islamic Council of Victoria Yasser Solomon said, Simmons comments were very unfortunate. I wonder if he's can do Abraham Solomon. His very famous obviously in Papadana's Result in Pohentile, he said, mixing the entertainment world with political and religious world as a mind-vealed. He said Simmons had begun by talking about extremists but had gone on to vilify the entire Muslim culture. A number of his claims regarding women and what they're allowed to do are not correct. He said, I thought women were doing really well in Iraq. Shut up. Simmons had a right to free speech but this had to be bounced against the damage done when us in people. He said, I think it would be good for overseas speakers and commentators to be given some sort of advice regarding our vilification laws here. He said, they leave and go back to where they arrived from but they leave behind a big mess that we have to live with. They leave their entrails behind. I think it's what he was trying to say and we have to sweep it all up and sniff it. I guess I got to burn my kiss records again. There you go. Well, it is more crap coming in here on this fax machine and that's not good news either. Most of it is from Clarence and he's really getting them. My nerves big time now. Man, just wait till I'm there. Oh, brother. I'm going to give him a piece of my mind. Join the QMQ East tonight from 6th to 8th of gas bees and Davey located off 5.95 and University Drive stop by for specials on bass beer. Plus a chance to win Marlon tickets other prizes. That's our usual low budget stuff. Six o'clock with bass beer and gas bees and Davey and join George tomorrow. Here's the important stuff because he needs the money badly, especially since he got charged so much to fix his car at Kim Boa Boa. Boa campers place. That's all good though. No, that's how it I heard. Should have been a freebie. Come on, Kim. Straighten that out. This guy's working for peanuts. Anyway, I'll say I just throw a little thing in there. Maybe he'll knock off a couple hundred. George tomorrow 11 at 4th of Pompano located at 1,000 North Federal Highway. Stop by the spin the wheel for prizes and joy. Free food from Atlantic City subs. That's with George at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning at 4th of Pompano. George will tell you about that great for that he was driving while his car was being fixed. Oh. There's a reason they call it a focus. See, at that point when I got through saying that, that's when you should have done one thing and that was dummy up. Here you go. The blue moon fish company says bill and four lot of day. Oh, they got to bill and blue moon. I've heard of that all along. Yeah. I've heard of that. I've heard that. That's very good. Look at you. Good list of restaurants. In fact, you cannot only vote on a pool. But then when you get through reading a whole thing this weekend, go out and eat a one of them. You know, or two of more three of them. WQA. Go to your own hotel. Yes sir. I like to at your phone. I have a comment. Go ahead. Arturo's in Boa and Boa Boa. Okay. And I like your said. 560, 560, 560. What is it this week? This has been the week that these people all of a sudden just like a mushroom climbed up inside their ass or something. It just started expanding. These people are just gone wild. Just gone insane. Gone way way beyond the usual call of duty if I can still say that in the air. Hi, how are you? What do you mean? What do you mean? I don't know. Man. WQA. Hello. Yes. Yes sir. Does it matter? Does it matter? Does it matter? Because it is matter. Because it is matter. Because it is matter. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I'll make sure that you get to eat there. I'm sure that what that steak house in New York that he ripped because it didn't kiss his ass. I wonder if he likes a lot. New York prime. New York prime. That's the one. New York prime in Boa. And he went there. And I guess they didn't like immediately sit him down and pat his muskware on the top and give all kinds of special treatment. I didn't pick up the check and so as a result it goes on the riffs him and ass. And Hank, I think if there was any chance, not that there ever was. But if there was any chance of the Hebrew hammer and mole like bonding a little bit, that was really the point. I would say just took different paths that came to that folk in the road. And Hank of course was working his fork and I very heavy duty, which is why he maintains that tremendous strength and mole in the meantime was to visit a trying to rearrange his muskware. They kept crawling down the side of his head. They hate you mole. Let me tell you that right now, they despise you. Can you imagine poor Joe Costo having to put up with that guy's crap? And what did I tell you about Geldi getting off of that show, huh? We know that I've been predicting that. He wants off of their bad desperate. He didn't even really talk any mole is what I was the tool last time I was there. And he moped. Don't talk no mole. I said to Geldi, I said how you and the old man get along these days, that we don't talk. Yeah. No mole. No mole. No mole. No mole. Can't imagine why. I know the beast is gotten back into good graces. In fact, maybe it'll be Mojo and the beast. It might be. You think? It could be. Wouldn't that be something? Wow, wow, wow. Just kiss and make up. All is forgiven. And where does that leave Moishi? Whatever his name is that they slept down from New York. What does he do on? Shai. Shai. Right. He would say the loser. Hold Robert Grippers hand, huh? Right. Who loved Jews? Okay. What is the best sit down restaurant in South Florida today? Not fast food. Ruth Chris 40. Joe Stone Crab's 10. Casa de Angelo 4. Kenyan's 3. Sage Cafe's got a pair. Emerald Coast 2. Foxes here went into. Mombo Jambo 1. I know you don't need it for a Blue Moon Fish company. We better get with it. Can we put our Taro's on there? I thought we were not because that was a uh. Nah, come on. Put our Taro's on there. I heard it's pretty good. Just because it's Jeff Heiz boyfriend. What do you want for me? WCWM line 9. Hello. Yes sir. We are also. I've been questioning that. But Nick Birnting. And I saw the whole video. And if you's why. Because you know what real? I'm tired of vanilla. I have to feel something. I'm tired of the media. Glocking over the sheer brutality of what's going on over there. That's why I had to see it. Okay. And when I did see it, I noticed there wasn't a lot of blood. Like you would expect coming out of a major artery when you put it. So what does that mean? I mean, it's it's it's probably. He was probably already dead before they did anything. But I mean, how could he have already been dead? You see him sitting there. I didn't see the whole thing. But I saw right up until the slicing the neck off. How are you been doing? I mean, something was going on. Because there wasn't as much blood. I mean, there wasn't. I mean, you would think if you kind of major artery. Yeah. It's called a lesson. George has got a list of good stuff films for it. I got a lot more blood. You'll enjoy them much more. Oh, I got this. Oh, I don't. It's just a joke. Google. Just a joke. A sick joke at that. But I mean, why are we arguing? Who's dead already? He's sitting there and moving around for quite a while. He's the thing. He was alive once upon a time and they found his body so the timing is really moved. Don't you think? Yeah, really. Whether or not there's a lot of water. A little bit of blood there. Monday or at least. Exactly. Right. Here's one. It says, please add the big cheese to your list. It's located on US one in 67th Avenue. Miami Great Food, Casual atmosphere and the beast still sucks. Well, if we're good, the Fax Elmer, thank you. Elmer says he's still suck beast. He's like that. Hey, Daniel. Stop back in the same facts over and over again. Well, what is Daniel got? He's the he up. We already got his and he wanted both of them on there. Well, what is he got? Just give me a rest and so. Okay. Don't start playing hard. Ask for these poor people. It's the one you already got. What? It's a Joe Lion. I'm old co-host and Joe Lion. And he keeps practicing. You forgot Joe Lion. You forgot Joe Lion. What? What is Joe Lion? That's Joe Lion. Joe. Diane. 1057. Maybe it's Joe Mama. I have no idea what he's talking about. Just once isn't off okay, Daniel. You got the Emerald Coast, which we love and that's fine. It's on. Otherwise, uh, just get lost. Okay. What's your problem, Daniel? I have no life. I can love. I just just watch when you're thanks to you. You way am. For you talk about punctual man. Dave Johnson, you could set your life by him and your watch. Right? You're there. I knew. Well, I just I just looked over because I thought to myself. It's 11 o'clock. Dave's going to be calling on you second and sure after the line is flashing. And you like I said, you could set the atomic clock on your head. It's post time. And not only that, but uh, you're talking to the guy that gave you the triple in the, uh, Derby. You are the king. You are the best. The king. No, I did not. Oh, listen, when you make it a big box, you don't have to like be vetting on silly things like horse races. But you, you were very, uh, negative on imperialism. You said, uh, that horse ain't fast enough. I'm sorry, and you let you pick that one. But we were both on the winner. That's the main thing. This is this, that's the, how many years, uh, where we've been begging. Not third man. Or a real great story. And of course, with all the grotesque things happening in the world right now, this would be so great. Have a real, nothing that's going to change anything. But you know, a nice story. Smarty Jones. It's a great, uh, the whole thing is bizarre. The story about the owners getting shot and the, uh, everything. It's, uh, it, uh, it went Joe Hirsch, the wonderful turf writer. He used to be come to the Derby. We always used to say, Joe, who do you like? And he'd say, the best story. Well, boy, he didn't come this year. It's the first year in 50 that he's in New York. Uh, not feeling that great. But this is the best story in the game. Speaking of not feeling that great when the owner is breathing oxygen, man. I thought to myself, this, this is, you couldn't have written a script like this. You know, he's breathing oxygen from a tank. Yeah. I thought that when the horse crossed the, uh, you know, one of the race I thought he was going to like loser right there. He just about did, I think. They're very nice people. And, um, you know, the money doesn't mean much to them. It doesn't mean I don't think it means anything to them. Well, then you and I can split it. I take them. Okay. Smarty Jones. I mean, obviously we're going to pick him again because we want a triple crown winner. We want a champion for years and years. We thought it was going to be funny side. We thought it was going to be, uh, who? No, no, no, I never thought it was going to be fine. I never liked funny side. Really? No, I didn't like him at all. I did. I did Empire Maker in the first. And, uh, I think I forget maybe peace rules in the second. No, I didn't like him. Well, but, uh, hey, that's water under the bridge. I think it a water, the track of course in the derby was like a mud, you know, was really a off track. Oh, it's awful. And it was splashing through the track. Now, what's it going to be in Baltimore? You're there right now. It is, it's dry and hot. They, they, they, we might get a couple showers, but it, uh, it appears that it's going to be a fast track. And they'll have to put water on it just to have a little bounce to it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a little bit of a sour thing that's stored Elliot was find, uh, the jockey. He, of course, like you said, he came from obscurity and to be like a bass shot went in the derby. Uh, he, uh, neglected to mention, what was it that he was convicted of? You know, I don't think, I think he just played guilty to a solving of, uh, and I, and it was, uh, must have been some booze involved. I think I was a pretty good drinker when he was young, but, uh, I'm wondering how many, how long, when you have to write it, suffocates, why not? I understand he's on the wagon for a couple years. So, I, I, I've given the benefit of it, out. Absolutely. Yeah. That's just adds to the ambiance of the whole thing. But even though jockey, let me ask you. Yeah, I know he is. I actually saw him write and suffocates down. Some of the 10 people still living went to suffocates down. Really? Even when they had harness racing, 100 years ago, with Eddie Cobb and Alex Winger, but that's another story. Wow. Now is the cliff edge in or out? Uh, as of right now, he's still in, but the, the way I saw him walking around the shed row yesterday, he looked out to you. So, uh, I don't know. Uh, I know Nick's either won't run him unless he's right. Plus he's got another horse in the right way. So, shackled him. Yeah. But they all got to beat Smartie. Yeah. Now, how much of a difference do you think that the Obtrag made in the derby? You think that was part of the effect or not? Probably not in Smartie's factor, but a lot of the other horses didn't fire. But the Smartie Jones is one five races on her on a fast track. Right. He, he, he probably, you know, loved this fast track to mom. Well, I'm, I'm, I'm, what I'm going to do is the same thing. I mean, why go off when you got to win or why go off. I'm going to do the same thing I did for the derby. I'm picking Smartie Jones to win imperialism to be third and then just use the all in the middle. So, what's seven all eight? What about the Lionheart? Do you think he'll finish second again? Could be. You know, now you've been going to the track for about 100 years like I have. And so many times when you see similar horses, the same horses and a race together. And you see them finish one two. And you just are looking. You're trying too hard to find something to beat that combination. It happens very often that that's, well, what, what comes out? These are the, maybe these are the best two horses in the race. But history is on the side of Smartie Jones. I think this will be a lot easier for him to win the pre-tunist in the Belmont. Why do you say that? Well, in the last seven years, the derby winner has won the pre-tunist five times. That's pretty good. So when it gets to the Belmont and they get on first of all on that track, which is totally different than of course the mile or half. That's interesting. It's a different ball game. Yeah, that the mile and a half is the, is the killer. I'm not, I'm, I hope he wins the pre-tunist because I'll, I hope that he wins the triple crown. But I think of the three races. Don't you think the pre-tunist is the easiest of the three to win? It seems to be, even Ronnie Franklin couldn't get beat in a, in a pre-tunist. Ronnie Franklin and Howard Cook fell to a vertical. Oh man. That's a shot at Porrani for you to put him in the same category with Howard and go sell. And we'll throw in more Howard David it. That's what you're at it. Brad, but what a trifecta that is. Holy cow. Ronnie Franklin is young as he has no hair. He's completely bald. Well, it was probably that, that riding a Belmont is what he did. Somebody should have told him was a mile and a half and out of six for a long sprint. He just forgot about that. And then of course, buddy, Dub Kim goes rescue make-out that story about the safety pin and a foot. That's too bad because I really like spectacular, but he was a member of my favorite all-time horses. But just one of them. I mean, buddy, Dub, he was honored yesterday here at the track. And he's still training in a very, very nice way. Yeah. Like I said, he covered up form real well. So anyway, what's your pick? I gave you mine. Seven all eight. The smarty Jones imperialism on the for third. I'll take smarty Jones on top with Lionheart second and the all button for the third spot. That isn't going to pay too much, Dave. We're looking for some cash. Hey, the favorites finished one two in the Derby and the superfacti-pate 41,000. That's what the superfacti-pate in the Derby. Wow, I wouldn't realize that. With the favorites finishing first and second. Because I saw the triple with my imperialism in there for third pay 940 sum out of bucks, I do believe. That's a signer, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Last time I checked, that's what fat rich tells me. Are you in Canada or the United States? I'm in Toronto right now. I'll be in Florida next week briefly because you know, I don't know. It's just one of them things. I keep coming back. I don't know why. Do you ever go to any of these race? You ever go to the Belmont? Why don't you come to the Belmont? If the Smarty wins. Oh, no. I don't want to start that gambling thing. You know, then you become a degenerate in your whole life. Changes and then you want to put GA in all of that. I just, you know, I just like talking about you. It's like I have the racing channel here and I watch the races from all over the country, especially my harness racing. And you can't lose the dime on it. And it's sad part of it is as you know, you pick all the winners when you watch. And when you have no Bitcoin, oh, no, probably you have a program. And you still pick and winters left and right. Just like Smarty Jones. Yeah. I think that's a new spaper article here in Toronto. Based on the story behind it. Is that right? Well, let's see. Get where a hand. Come sure. Hank is around. Are not too far. I saw him at the draw on Wednesday night. What a great guy. He's a real. He is a he is a super person. He's a giant in the broadcasting and in the Thurbred industry. Make no mistake about him. When you guys get back on TV on ABC, if that ever happens, then we'll see you guys together on TV again. If that happens, that would be great. Why are you chuckling when I say that? Because I don't think it'll happen. But if that's that would be great. I'd love to work with Hank. There you go. Well, listen, give him a big kiss for us and keep him away from that buffet. Please, we want to keep him around a long time. I'll be in front of it. Don't worry. Have a great race. Dave and we'll see you in the Belmont. We're talking in three weeks. Take care. Bye. Dave Johnson, who they called on the radio, the pre-nistemorrow. Smarty Jones and Imperialism. I didn't realize the super paid 41 grand. Jesus. He just played it right. Nobody sent me any money saying, hey, here's the horse of the money. You want me in the Derby? Do they just listen to me? Okay, let's see. The best sit down restaurant, the Raskelhouse. Oh, my God. Holy moly. That other business. If you also, it says in this recipe, you don't put the pizza loft in plantation and Davey ponytail will have a fit and brick and nail. We're not putting the pizza loft on air. I mean, pizza loft is excellent, but it's the best sit down restaurant in South Florida. It's just like this other one. Here's Smokey Bones, Barbecue and the Fountains shopping center. I mean, I don't even like barbecue, but if I did, you can put that on there. You can put pizza loft on there too. Make Jeff feel happy. I don't know. Especially with all the meals that he can't keep buying the rimmers. It's one I'm here. That's what I heard yesterday when I was buying. Smokey Bones, Barbecue. See there you go again, Judge McDawable. But you get a life in turn off the radio. I have no life. Go hook up with Mollon. Go on and play some golf. Get some exercise. Man, you actually, if we didn't have the hair, he looked just like the beast, Judge McDawable. He's the beast with bad glasses on. Or no, he don't have the glasses anymore. He's got those contacts. Although, you know, it didn't help much if you listen to the games. Police revised rules after 97 year old ones. See, one thing I can't deal with is sensitive people. It just bothers me. It bothers me. It's just a radio show, okay? Could you say your sense of politics? I don't have any problem with you McDonald personally. He's an ice guy. He certainly was a humongous improvement over Chris Moran. I got who used to do those Panther games. I mean, that's like the difference between day and night. Just hearing Judge McDawable's voice. You say, hey, there's a hockey announcement. There's real broadcaster as opposed to Christina Moran. Yeah. So I don't have any problem with you, Judge. But just don't be so sensitive. Don't be so uptight. Rimmer and I are good friends. It's cost me a lot of money, believe me. But he's okay. He's a good guy. Means well. You know, it's always a disaster. But he means well. But the jugs and mo and somebody's old. And he's always the old buddy, Dougdies and mo and you hear what he said about me? You remember that and we're from the very beginning. Right. You say the things that they're saying about me and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the. Well, what may have been the greatest call of all time. I got to find it now. Oh, here it is. This may have been the all time best. The doctor that performed the surgery on the J.C.L.S. Some didn't need the same doctor that performed the procedure on your Q.A. Um, Um, The doctor who performed the surgery. What's think about that? What's his name? Klein. You feel a doctor? No, I don't know who you, you, you're a call. I'm going to come back. I'm not sure where you're. I'm not sure where you're. I'm not sure where you're. You go to Holy Cross. I am. Not sure. Well, bottom line is that. The doctor's can't tell. Oh, and Jay is going to be out. No, you're not sure somewhere. At least the month could be up to eight weeks. Some were in there. While he had the old, you're on Q and M. See, the whole deal with that is that he had the Robert, whoever was in there dump the call because he didn't want to go on here. And that hadn't been very early on in his Q and experience. He didn't have any idea how to hold the lay thing work. Right. So he thought that if he just paused and stalled along around long enough, somehow that that would be the way it wouldn't. It wouldn't get on the years. I don't know. I don't know if he was going to refer to it at all if they dumped it. Right. He just could have put the realized that. We never understand that. So he was like, uh, well, it was the name of that. And then of course, Gully. Well, like, you know, boards a little bit there, which is what makes that whole bit. He was going Gully's for me. We're not talking these days. No, not very much. They just sit in there. It's kind of like an iceberg. In that studio when Mo and the guilty mice do in there. So that's probably why these deals go on because Gully badly wants off of that. He wants badly to work with his good buddy Joe Rose, who is real easy going. Really easy to get along with a good close. Close tight. Chums. Yeah. They're real tight. Anyway, what's the best fast, uh, Bams are a best sit down. Not fast food restaurant in South Florida today. I don't think I'm getting my email again today. I think I haven't some, it's not me.

Jombone killer commits suicides as the inquire about this authorities have ignored suspect for years. According to then, the man who killed six-year-old Jombone Ramsi's committed suicide, the inquire was learned exclusively in what's more may have even left a deathbed confession. That's the stunning evidence the inquire is uncovered. Oh my God. I knew investigation of the little beauty queens Christmas 1990s is murder and border Colorado. During our probey of Tain Police Photos taken at the scene of the suicide, they reveal clues that like to victim 26-year-old Otto Jumpyard worker Michael Helgoth to Jombone's brutal slaying. Clearly, visible our pair of high-tech boots and a stun gun items at the center of the Jombone case. Another item also stands out, a mini cassette recorder close by Helgoth's limp hand. The recorder vanished in the 30s looking for what's there could be a confession on it. The encar also learned that home video is found hidden in Helgoth's house. Each or random shots of young girls and a news clip on the still on Sold 1993 kidnapping a murder of another Colorado girl. And we discovered that Helgoth told a friendly was involved in Jombone's murder. Helgoth has body festooned with tattoos of the grim reaper of Robert Greeper bearing the word next, and a skeleton dripping blood, shot himself dead in his boulder home on Valentine's Day 97. The day before then bolder district attorney Alex Hunter edition of Warning to the Killer, he was hunting during a televised nude conference. We will see that justice is served in this case and you pay for what you did 100% as he stared cold item to cameras. Of course he wasn't talking to him, he just talked to him in general. Helgoth came to the attention of a 30 shortly after his suicide and it goes on and on and on forever. Boulder and it goes on about the police weren't really all that interested in him. They focused on the parents. But John Kennedy, a friend and co-worker of Helgoth grappled with his conscience, Kennedy 50, told the inquire that before Helgoth suicide, his friend told me he knew something about Jombone's death that he was involved, that it was a kidnapping gone bad. I had a little bit of a moral conscious. It seemed to me he wanted to confess. Three weeks after Helgoth suicide Kennedy said he set that with boulder detective Jane Harmer in a relationship Tommy Harmer, one of the cops investigating Jombone's murder. She took my information and never contacted me again. He said, I like that. So many bad police investigations, you know it? But, to the essence of the story, it says, relatives of Helgoth vehemently deny it, anything you do with Jombone's murder, to anyone trying to link Mike to the death of Jombone. Ramsey, I would say it doesn't appear that way to me, Helgoth's uncle Dick Helgoth told the inquire. I don't believe it was a killer. I know Mike had a pair of high-tech boots, but so does just about every outdoorsman in Colorado. Because a stun gun and high-tech boots were found in his body. And of course they were like, huh? I have a stun gun in high-tech boots. Uh, George Dunnett, because we have a never-before-seen crime scene photo here. And, well, it's just got all bunch of crap. So there you go, believe it or not. And then, of course, John Ransy knows running for the Michigan House. He's going to be a politician, not, I thought he is nasty wife. Of course, he's got, she's been dying a cancer for a very long time. Hasn't she? Yes, she has. For a very long time. Too long, if he asked me, I mean, even if she had nothing to do with it, I still just don't like her. Isn't that bad? She was a pageant mom. She inflicted that on her little kid, which is 10 amount of child abuse. And that's where everybody might say so to her. That was the raspberry, but it was a way for anybody that's sitting out there. Don't get all panicking now. That was the raspberry Danish. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. They're very best sit down restaurant in South Florida. I got to be honest with you. I mean, seriously, why compare Ruth Christ to some of the other names that are getting mentioned on this list. I think of myself, man, what a bunch.

It's just dawn at me all the times that I've eaten there. Probably me and the rumors and Sid Levin are the only Jews I can. Mostly like old white-haired Graham eating it Ruth Christ. That probably because of where it is in Florida, you know? See what I'm saying? It's not really like a, it isn't what you can like Jesse would call Heini Town. That part of town. It's a gay hood.

I remember that one day we had those people calling in all those conspirator lists to believe all the crap that's on the internet. I just don't believe that. I drink gallons. Gallons of nights, so in every day. Like I gave it up for about two days. And then I said, I must be nuts for years. Right, for years and years and years. I don't, I'm not in great shape.

As patrons leave the theater, I'll give them a copy of the interview with Saddam Hussein. We're glass-be gravel to him. Very good Jim, excellent. See there are some people even in spite of the fact that they tried desperately to keep this stuff under rep. Are some people like Leakin out the truth? Oh, but he was an evil man and he used gas on it. Yeah, he used chemical weapons on his own people because we sold them to him to use against the Iranians so that we could keep that word going. We could keep the stalemate between Iraq and Iran so that we could keep the Iatrol on his heels. That's what it was all about. He was our evil doer. And anybody who tells the other ISIS is a freaking liar, especially that crummy rummy man. Who goes over there yesterday with a dog and pony-shoulder, try to resurrect his image and try to save his fattled, wrinkled up ass. Who's he kidding? Obviously a lot of people because about 60% of Americans- Oh yeah, rum-strel's great. We got to keep him in there. We don't want to change your ships in the middle of whatever. He was so brave.

I got one. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bit closet. Yeah. And one thing don't be concerned about it. I don't get how many day go get any walk, free smoke, come bust, come out of the one one. Right, don't worry about that. Well seriously, it's a great place. Vinter a long time, man. That's one of the oldest, uh, that's still around. And they give you, I mean, just the enormous amounts of food. And I'm not talking about for me, special. They know who I am in there. But I'm telling you, they just give you enormous amounts of food, like muscles and all kinds of appetizers. And by the time you get to the main course, you're like, oh my god, are you kidding me? I'm going to eat more. Anthony's run away 84. Get that on there. It's one of the reasons that it is outstanding. It all in me for a year when I'm back there. I'll get, uh, Derek to fix you all up. Okay. Right. They. And hopefully in fact, maybe if, you know, I want the whole family to come out of their alive, we can probably fix that up to. Uh, here's a fact that says from Bob, just a few things. I did this is great because now there's a big, you know, I, I have to apologize to that to dark and click the guy to call before about the hidden blood. Because I didn't watch it. It says I didn't watch the video, but I saw still pictures from none other than Fudgy, Droggy site. There is no blood. And the picture of them holding up his head, there is no blood. How is that possible if he was alive when he capitated? Why was he wearing an orange jumpsuit the same as the US uses on its prisoners? His body was reported to be found Saturday, May 8th, but he was killed Tuesday, May 11th. How is that possible? How do you like that? And that's got some links for us to check out. For what? That worth. Yes. We have the video. If you want it. I don't want to see it. I don't want to see it. Did you watch it? No, but I have it. And? And I don't want to see it, but we have it. Did the beast watch it? Beatswatched it. And? I saw it. And to me, when they be handed in, when they chop this head off, they looked like those pools of blood. But when he did the fascist right, when they held up his head, there was no blood. But who knows what the time difference was? Right. Yeah, it seemed to me that they're probably after the head. I mean, I don't want to get to graphic here, I'm almost at lunchtime. But after the head is severed from the body, there really isn't that voluminous in a amount of blood in the head. You know, once it all spurts out, and it may be, who knows, like you said, how long they waited before they cleaned it up a little. But so do recognizable. They held it up. I don't know. And anyway, there's a bunch of big bloggers.berg execution video. Mystery Shows hostages Iraq trip. FBI told police to hold burg. Fissie circumstances and flawed timelines surrounding America's Americans be hitting from infowords.com. Says these are just a few that raise very interesting questions. Lies, what lies? I guess Bush, Rummy, and the rest of the neocons, including pill popping rush. Don't consider them lies until they actually get caught. Even then we didn't hear what we really heard. We didn't see what we really saw. Lies to them involve only a stupid crap like VJs in the over-eocons, and such not war crimes, WMD, 911, etc. And also for the poll, I vote for Alexander's implantation says, Bob, thank you, Bob. Put that over there, keep it all website. Oh. So I guess we better maybe we've had an outplay that severed head thing. Today, here's this story. Miami, a Nicaraguan immigrant filed a lawsuit against the arts dice. These have Miami accusing a form of priestess sexual abuse 20 years ago. Another one of these isolated incidents to have lines is lawsuit legislator. We bought a priest rape teenage refugee in 1984. A refugee in Ola. Wow, that who cares? The suicide cloud by the now 33 year old victim was identified as John Doe. One, though. Is the fifth implicating Ernesto Garcia Rubio? In the suit, the plaintiff alleges Garcia Rubio approached at our lady of divine providence in sweet water. Rape to the 1984 when he was a 13 year old refuelier seeking asylum. Garcia Rubio was removed as pastor that person 88 commit claims he had sexually abused several Latin American refugee boys. The Vatican removed him from the priesthood in 1994. The suit filed in date circuit court yesterday alleges that the art dice these of Miami knew he had a history of sexual misconduct when he was hired. A statement released by the arts dice he says today said, Garcia Rubio is not been associated with local Catholic church for 15 years, but declined to come and unrelated lawsuit of course. The suit includes confidential church documents showing the late art spissor of Coleman F. Carol have been told, serious difficulties of a moral nature force Garcia Rubio to leave Cuba. But the documents did not suggest his problems related to pedophilia. And in arts dice, he's background check found no evidence of wrongdoing of course. Garcia Rubio became the spiritual director of a make-it-little sound high school and co-kind of Grovin 70. It was moved to the sweet water perished five years later. And once they start moving them around, you generally configure this pretty good reason. Two lawsuits against Garcia Rubio were said a lot of court for 75 grand each. He belongs in jail said attorney Jeffrey Herman who has filed all the one lawsuits against the arts dice he's involving Garcia Rubio. Just another isolated incident. How many millions of these uh... Bob Birdman? Line balls, yeah. Here's the facts. It says the best restaurant in South Florida is Michael's kitchen, Dany Beach, even at their own website.

Emerald coast 15, the big cheese 11. See when I put the big cheese on her, I know it's, I shouldn't say this, but it makes me think they're like Chuckie cheese. Right. And that's probably very bad, but that's what I think of. That's that. It's bad. Blue Moon Fish Company 9 Pizza Lothus got 8. Holy moly Jeff must be going nuts. Kenyan 7, Casa da Angelos 6, Mombo Jambo 5, Christie's 5, Sage Cafe 4, Edward or this Nangel 4. Senan Hel, the palm 4, Fox is sharing in for Smokey Boons Barbecue's got 3. Smokey Boons Barbecue is the best. Sit down restaurant in town. It must be great. You don't even have to take the metro rail to get through either. Unlike shorties.

Silent whose scenes got a pair of black orchids got 2, 1 for our touros, 1 for Cafe 1909, 1 for the Rascal House. Texas David Azil has got 1 and none yet, well they just went on there. These are the ones Anthony's runway 84. Alexander's Michael's Kitchen, Crabby, Jack's and La Varandata over at Little Over 200 votes. Lots of time I'll have a list of maybe a thousand of these by the and then all we can log you can prove them and then you can go try them out. And then I'm Monday and say, man we tried that one there and it really sucked. Or the other way around. But no he's so floored, I'll say, I always have a awful one and then we had a pay for it too. WQAM Hello. Is this Neil? Yes sir. Hey Neil, how are you doing? I got power. Once for your pull there. Okay. It's a casual place but it's often called Cafe Tex-Mexing Kendall. Okay.

Okay. Maybe it's me. Let me read the question again. What is the best sit down? No fast food restaurant in South Florida today. I don't have a problem with this question. To me it's as simple as just peeing in the in the bowl. You know, as it just what's the best sit down restaurant in South Florida today? It's nothing complicated there, right? How many can I name it? Bob Birdman. But he he meant well. So cafe text message will take the first one and then that's it. Can we ever put Christie's on there? I don't think we did. Did we have a beer? That's the beast fall. Let's blame him because he's a geables guy. Well, his UMKRA. He's our data entry guy today. Yeah. So like I said, oh, Christie's got five. I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm sorry. I glossed over. Chris Christie's is great. There's another one in the Gables which I don't know if it's in business anymore. I can't think of it. Man, I used to eat there all the time back in the day. God, it was a great place. I mean, it really, maybe it was Christie's. I don't know. It was really, I think it was Luke Christie's. 560560, pound 560. That's our poll today. What are they 85 best restaurants who beat net this week? 560560. 380. 380. Your, you, you, you, you, you. This is Dick Kenny. I'd like to relax by having my mental massage. My balls while listening to the new rotis welcome one hour. Mm-hmm. Hey, there's more hot weather than I've been in it. But he grew home on the age of the day and riverdale. Now, you might be in school the, uh, attribute it to the flat out he in the paradise. Well, it is. But not for everybody. That's why my parents retired the Florida. I sent them back to the Bronx to live in the Hebrew home at the age of the back in 61. Not only was it cheap, but they got so cool. I remember my mama was saying, who needs flat? We got to pull right here. It's with me three months out of the year. And who I should? They get lots of activities there. Like, um, right in my, John, and followed then the races. Not to mention the food. Oh, the food. Let me tell you nowhere, but the Hebrew home at the age of the riverdale. Will you find soft good jell-o? Not the kind of turns to rubble about. I was almost like was from bed by John Wilson himself. Man, and they got them, uh, mobile turrets and wheels too. The Hebrew home could he age it in riverdale. A nice place to send your folks. And, in fact, good about it. 12, a lot of five 60 by the way, more on case you're listening. I'm sure you are.

Now, you don't want to go there during the early bird because it's a sea of just, uh, not just blue here, but of white here. I mean, just unbeleivable. Unbeleivable. Is one of those? You're going to yesterdays? No. No? No. Well, why not? That's right. Not anywhere near you. Anyway, we'll put yesterdays on there. Amendment proposing slot machines at South Florida Tracks and Frontons gets court nine. Oh, right. That's what I mean, it's going to pass, but anyway, we got to start somewhere. Maybe bring Florida into the 15th century at least. A proposal, let South Florida voters decide if they want slot machines at Doggahor's Tracks and Highlight Frontons to a key hurdle for getting on the November ballot yesterday. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the ballot measure proposed by the group called Floridians for a level playing field meets the legal requirements to get on the ballot, namely that it sticks primarily to one subject and that it's clear enough for voters to understand what they're being asked to approve. So better be very clear because it floated like that. Kind of like our poll questions every day got to make him very simple. They still don't get it. It's back. There's still need to get nearly half a million signatures to get the measure before the voters advocates for the proposal are about halfway there with elections, officials having verified just under quarter of million signatures. The measure would answer voters state why if they want to change the state constitution to allow datan-browered counties to old referendum, some other to authorize slot machines, and existing per mutual facilities in some cases, would also give the education programs any revenue to state gets from taxing the slot machines. Let's get with it. Okay. It's long overdue, baby. Florida voters have rejected similar gambling measures three times in last 25 years, but track owners say they need to expand their options to be able to compete with gambling and indeed casinos see they weren't similar measures. That's not what the measures were. That's not what it said the other casinos gambling, but this is a sunset and again where they publish a lot of crap. Maybe one time jick is on for ready-calf of the ballgame that you want to call them ask them how come his news paper puts so much crap in there every day? Like the flyers wonder game three last night against Tampa Bay? The first thing that came along was the lottery and that was devastating said Frederick Cabinet, keep executive of Flagver Greyhound track and Miami. Then we got the Indians and the votes to know where they're totally unregulated and totally untouched. Well we're saying his taxis are regulated, us and put us on level playing field. He is absolutely... Absolutely correct sir. Measurebackers also argue they can help boost education spending at a time on the state is led by officials who are adamantly opposed to most tax increases. Enko's on about the opponents say this and they say that and then we'll have casinos and then we'll have this. Governor Jamborset gambling is not a panacea for tight budgets and said he believes increased gambling increases crime. I'm going to vote against it, Boiset. What a slime hole you know what? Careful. What a class hole. I'm going to vote against the courtiest because he's a goody too she was scony baloney. He's still busy trying to keep that sniff alive. That's what he's worried about. With Terry's law, he's going to go all the way to the Supreme Court of Fiesto to put on his grandstand act. Let me say it again. W's bad. Jeb is 10 times more dangerous. Keep your eye on his ass and believe you meet its plenty of territory. Line 9 QAM hello. Hey Neil, how's it hanging? I'm Ryan. How about Jackson's stay couch in Waterville? I heard that's great. Where's that? It's downtown Waterville. Kind of like by the Los Ols here. I've placed that also stakes. Okay. I'm going to be a Jeb at that radio. Boacraft is why we're calling all Ron? No. Go to Big One O. We had that on yesterday. Okay. Or where? But it comes to radio man. We're on it. Yeah. It's 2. But it could be on 109.5. Or maybe 11.5 would be good. Anyway. Have a great weekend, Pally. Thanks. Paul and old Ron are going to Big One O. Sixth year. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. We're going to go to the next one. This is so good. It's long though. No, no. No, it's not that long. Now I'll put a couple more names for the list. But this is so good. It's by Mike Furner with uncommon dreams.org. It's on our website. Am I email is screwed up again. Do you ever have that happen? That's twice and long for me. You did? Yeah. We have an email screw up. It doesn't happen often with Yahoo. Well, this is twice and long week. I don't use Yahoo. I know. But at any rate, this never happened to me before twice and a week. I said, Eric and email said, send me something for a test. And I haven't gotten anything. Maybe I did now. Let me just take a look. After I got from one or one or stream to the other. I used to be a very anti-email guy. I remember it packs and they wanted to email me. Oh, and ratings from all of them. Email. And I'm just faxing them. And they don't email or I was a penny. Yes. You know, move on. Outward upward. Oh, man. No. I don't have any messages on there. I don't have any. Nothing. Try email. You try email me something while I agree this piece. All right. I'll say you'd make a picture of York. Of whom? York. Oh, no. Anyway, my fernar writes, shocked. I'm simply shocked that abuse is going on here. George, that's not the way Americans do things bushes outrides. General, those troops let us down, Kim it is outrides. Senators and congressmen are outraged. Everyone is shocked. Simply shocked here that abuse is going on an abode grab prison. Of course, it's an outrage that American soldiers and mercenaries are torturing Iraqi prisoners. But ask anyone who's gone through military basic training. They might want to ask you. Well, what do you think was going on in Iraq? What could be more naked abuse than custer bombing children in terrorizing whole cities? What could be more obscene than sending armals and legless dies home by the plain load? Our leaders are outraged at what's happening inside Abu Graib? Well, they know full well that next door in Haluja are troops were killing so many people, including women and children, that the soccer stadium was turned into a cemetery. There have been pictures of all of this, too. Not on 19th century fox of other corporate news outlets, but there were pictures of plenty. In 1984, Orwell describes how big brother keeps the citizens of Oshianna in line with a daily televised two minutes hate direct explanations public enemy number one. He was the primal trader, all treachery's acts of sabotage, heresy's deviations spring directly out of his teaching. He seemed like some sinister enchander capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization. Once the good people of Oshianna work up a good hate, they're ready to let big brother do whatever he wants to protect him from their supposed enemies. Vom them killed them young and old put them in places like Abu Graib. We of course don't do this personally, we're preparing vulnerable segment of our own population to do it for us. It's called basic training. We take kids helping for college looking for direction, heads full of myths about how Oshianna always stands for freedom and democracy. The system adequately dehumanized them in basic training and teach them how to dehumanize others over there until those others become the enemy. Surely whatever happens to the enemy is fair game they are after all, the enemy. Consider this from Hal Musket who went through basic training at 4 ticks New Jersey describing a frightening scene during bayonet practice for a thousand young men. In between the call responsive, what's the spirit of bayonet killed killed real unthrufted dyes would pick up mega phones and scream, see those 130s landing, bringing in bodies of dead Americans killed by gooks, the gooks murdered our soldiers, do you want to be a body on that plane? I can't hear you, what's the spirit of the bayonet? Every once in a while a devout would pull several of us aside and give us lessons on the proper use of bayonet and performing a field abortion. Stick the bayonet in the gooks, I can't say the word, and pull it up toward her throat, but dead gooks and the womb saves American lives. Or this from Roger Dama Galsky, discriminated with told us of a coolness duties after basic training. From the first moment we arrived we often heard the words, girls, ladies, sices and worse when insulting us. And there's another one we can't say. Thus women as a whole become a derogatory concept, very sexist, very dehumanizing. I've been dehumanized to such an extent that I completely like all empathy for these frightened new trainees. Instead of treating them decently, I'm as treated them as I've been mistreated. Once a dehumanized a person you need to maintain control because such a person's libel to do anything from a relatively mild hazing eye engaged to. To the Nazi-like tactics used by the guards against Iraqi prisoners, yes basic training works all to well sometimes. Should we be shocked that good American kids are filling phallugious soccer fields with corpses, torturing prisoners in obograe, braving their own female comrades? While in Baghdad recently more than one Iraqi asked me this tough question, how can your soldiers do these things for America? Don't you live in a democracy? Perhaps someday we will live in a democracy no longer train soldiers to do these things in our name, but until then we continue to live much closer to the condition Eugene Demtus grabbed in the closing months a World War I's Butcherine is famous Canton of High-O speech. When the feudal lords concluded to enlarge their domains, they declared war upon one another. But they themselves did not go to war anymore than the modern feudal lords, the burns of Wall Street could have war. The service of Intatably that when they managed to defy the war upon one another, it was their pay-threative patriotic duty to come on another's trotes. The working class who fight the battles and furnish the corpses have never yet had a foist needed a clearing war or making peace. George Bush can be outraged as the news from Ibo Grey, but he is the one who unleashed the dogs of war at the behest of our modern feudal lords. The result is never pretty. Are we shocked? Mike Furner visited Iraq for too much earlier this year. He served as Navy Corman during Vietnam, member of the Veterans for Peace and a former military to leader Ohio City Council. Good night, sir.

And joined by the Catholic action league, we sure know about them, 11 state lawmakers in conservative legal groups in Boston, Michigan and Mississippi. Matthew Staver, president and general counsel of the U.S. Wright Wing Liberty Council, had argued that the state's high court overstepped its bounds when a rule denovement that gay marriage should be legal in Massachusetts, he pleaded with the federal judge of her hunt as constitutional train wreck. How do you like that? A state attorney arguing on behalf of the Supreme Judicial Court said that the court based attuning on the Massachusetts Constitution and the case did not belong in federal court. The Massachusetts Court ruled that city and town clerks could begin issuing marriage licenses to gay couples starting on Monday. Oh, right, you go. Get on that plan, Beast.

Bird 26 was the owner of a permitious methods tower sir we know that. How do you like that? Before heading to Iraq March 14 he built an 854 tower for civile's country. W H W can bring him to New York did you know that? No I did not. Little trivia there for a late Nicholas bird. So we got two more fided guys man everybody's getting fired in this business they're getting fired again suspended they're getting like a whole weird fine. Find it at all in their case. Yeah well deserved. Sean had it he played the audio tune I don't know what his comments were whether they are appropriate or inappropriate but I think him getting fired will be a real plus from Fox News radio but he won't put that out of it. All of these people are cool as it said not the best restaurant how about Jimmy's west of president circle in Hollywood. It says old waggle's home cooking fresh veggies great soup and one price dinner very good dessert. And then scum another one. It also says goodbye Paul and Ron. Well there you go. See we deemed himself right there the S into that fact we even put or not as whatever you want from that because it sounds to me like sloppy but anyway the best sit down restaurant Metro kitchen in varney aster hotel on Washington 10th and South Beach the Metro kitchen in var. What ever happened to some young guy what's the name of that place? Side home short. No no they are Thai Tommy. How? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm Thai Tommy saying fun a best Thai food. Yeah whatever happened to that guy's he ever go out of business or the be says it's still there. Still there Thai Tommy. How do you like that? Well mean there's a lot of other people like to want to rest around with it some nice nice white people. Uh-huh. Or maybe some even not so nice white people. I would prefer to go in a restaurant where the food was good. I don't get a crap who's eaten in there. Unless they're like real smart me you know. Like a glass glass. In the rascal house I'm going to tell you right now man it will be very very foreign few places in America other than maybe in somewhere in New York. Where the rascal house would stay in business. And I have been in the near so maybe maybe they're really nice in there. You think maybe the services great and they treat you really well I doubt it. Probably on Beyoncé's the whole barbaric idea of being just showing the food at you treating you like crap like Joe's. I still see that college kid sitting there with those nice pants with a crease in the whole deal dressed up nice and they orange juice spilled just running over the table all of his pants and she takes his sweet times and says I saw that he'd let you be a west problem. I want to get up and slap the bitch myself you know. And anyway Izzool at the manvid Oriental hotel Izzool was recently voted one to world's 50 best new restaurants in condoness traveler a hot list of one of America's 10 best hotel restaurants by food and wine magazine as well as being the best restaurant 2001 by escar magazine. Azul at the Mandarin Oriental hotel where when I was the Mandarin Oriental hotels that on South Beach I don't know I do where there is. Bricle key. Oh really? Bricle key well as skew is me that's a little bit beyond all of our scope in it. It's where the beast lives. The beast lives on Bricle lots right. His folks have got the big bus. That's why he weighs 600 pounds and they keep pampering him and you know I'm using him. I'd sue their ass if you want to get some big bus sue your parents for parental malpractice. How's he gonna do that when he's dead? Well we'll take it. We'll head a look case for it. We'll get normal can't see into him or she's lost humanly. The German restaurant you think about on federal is the very invillage. Thank you that's what somebody else said to in your right. The very invillage was very very very good. Of course these days you know that kind of goose stepping sound gets a little bit nervous but that's okay. WQAM hello. QAM not there can't imagine why WQAM hello. For a wheel? Yes. How you doing Neil? Pretty damn good. I got 17 restaurants for the pool. Okay let's have the first tip. I know it's probably not an issue in the public but I like a place. Listen don't apologize it's your taste man it's what you like now let everybody else like. It's right and I guess in your book if you're a poor car I guess I'm a poor car too so I like big portions and big portions of pretty good food that the cheesecake factory. Ooh okay. Alright Neil enjoy your Louisville thanks Pally see at the sawgrass not there are other people that are reading a meal I've ever been important they were decided to serve you with the foods okay the cheesecake yeah I've heard so many bad things about that I mean their cheesecake is outstanding it's awesome you can stand here for a half an hour wait for a slice to take home set the burn half an hour waiting for a waiter then set the right hours waiting for your food right of course now is there another one beside the one in the sawgrass is that it doesn't want to have a turn right oh there is they're all over the place really yeah the cheesecake factory well that's good because I sure is how not going to the sawgrass even was very close by main convenient when you park and after walk 16 miles just you get to the purple parrot entrance it's a little bit disconcerting you know all they have to walk off that cheesecake so that's good I still don't understand for the life of me we've been asking for what year did they build let's see I'm trying to think it must have been uh it'll have been a must have been 13 14 years ago they built the sawgrass mills mall because I watched them build it from my backyard my old house my previous house and for the life of me and all those years I keep asking people why do so many tourists go there why they bring these busloads of people what is the attraction is it like a major store there a chain a map what what do they show up therefore state of mind I mean they got a couple of food courts in there with the Nathan's which are like Nathan's hot dogs but I'm sure's not going to slip over to the sawgrass and walk four miles to the purple parrot to go into the by a hot dog and you know they're just I don't get it and a place is always packed nobody in our spaghetti in glaze all these Brazilian people which I'm sure they're very very nice that they would speak Spanish which they don't what they don't speak a day speak

Let's see there's an article on our website that they would you really ought to read You ought to read all of them, but even though I know you won't Where was the press when the first Iraq prison allegations arose? It's a long article by Greg Mitchell and editor in publisher magazine, but I'm not going to read it because most of it is an interview Is the press tried to make up for lost time once again. The media is now bursting with a counts of prison abuse and I'll be gray Another Iraqi prison, but where were they last fall? Whenever it's a wrongdoing started to emerge when a public accounting might have halted what turned out to be the worst of the incidents It was not an officially sanctioned story that begins with a handout from an official source Charles J. Hanley, pull its your prize when in correspondent for the associated press told me this week Hanley was the first reported dig in the accusation of abuse when he returned to Baghdad for his latest to her press duty last September I've led to a series of stories culminating in a shocking report shocking I know, remember first of last year based on interviews with six released detainees he is still amazed that apparently no one else was looking into the allegations And no major newspaper picked up as reporting after it appeared. Why? That's something you'd have to ask editors that major newspapers. You said because there does seem to be very strong prejudice toward investigating U.S. officials statements with credibility while disregarding statements from all any other source and in this current situation your mackey sources Investing U.S. officials statements were incredible just like the stuff about the depapitated one Really sad. Yeah, all well, we did never had them in our in custody. We never got a hold of him right and And that email they must have just made that up Right, it wasn't really stories like fall toll of detainees being attacked by dogs humiliated by guards spending days with hoods over their heads Now from in your images in the urban and American minds even after the Pentagon promised an investigation in January and us to rest in March Handly was surprised when it was not more interest in investigative reporting done It's hard to fault my colleagues and bag that considering the pressure and danger they feel many stories are missed That's the way it is in more but clearly there's a mindset in the U.S. media that slows the aggressive pursuit of stories that make the U.S. military look bad And that was not what the whole interview and you can read it on our website By a great Mitchell They've known about it for months and months and months and again the tragedy the thing that they're most The Smate about was those pictures That's the problem. That's what Rumsfeld is pissed off about. That's what bushes humiliated and disgraced by the pictures getting out Okay, can you please hold those pictures for another couple of weeks over there at CBS please? No, can't do it can't do it, pal. I Because if the pictures never would have gotten out the same craft would be going on right now You're girlfriend Linda English.
