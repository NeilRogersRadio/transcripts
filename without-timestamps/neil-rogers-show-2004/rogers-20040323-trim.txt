Did I hear Joseph and Moe was very entertaining? Absolutely. That is a shucker. Oh, that was a good idea. That was a good idea. Thank you very much. Why you gave me a good job. Everybody's gonna die. People will party, we burners and high days, I bet that in a magazine. It'll come in both stores. If you believe it's the end of the world, and choose our market, ration again. We're gonna be the man we have so long to have. So come to the parade. Be a friend. Be very afraid of your tenure as Secretary of State. We lost 224 people. Pretty excited. The 9th of 11th commission is finally meeting. How do you like that? Is it kind of Lisa gonna testify in public this time? No, no. He just got through saying we are encouraged and we wish he would be here and reconsider any odd yoddy. And it was like a sitting ovation, but she ain't gonna do it. Which 10 out to at 5. 16 WQAM. This is a little bit disturbing. In fact, I probably should have waited to play. Be a friend. Be very afraid. Until I've heard mentioned this. And that is really defensive. What was that guy? He was something. He once ate halivai and Tel Aviv or something. I've had a conversation about it. They're not the call yesterday that you said showed up in the current. Oh, he's a guy. I don't know. Yeah. He's a former Israeli army guy. He made me a good guy, but he's for a crap. Israeli defense minister Shaul Mofaz and his security team. So decided to try to kill the entire Hamas leadership without waiting for another terror attack. Security sources said they they're going to kill them all. Also the Israeli army chief ended that Palestinian leader, yes or Amafar, could be in the cross here as for his Israeli attack soon. So I'm also a bit afraid. Be very afraid. Yeah, there's a lot of crazy people running around in the world where we're just trying to stay alive. That's all. That's all we want to do. Minor old business. Enjoy life a little bit. That's all. While it lasts. Right. While it lasts, while he leaves us alive. Just enjoy just a teeny tiny bit. I mean, we can't say. And we can't do anything. But now today we will get to 10,000 on our stop at CC.com. We're brainstorming. It looks like if USA today will take the ad, which I think they will. Why not? So what did I say? We need to raise to get the quarter page ad and USA about 30. Yeah, about 30 is right. I got to hear some or look at in the bat. I do have the book in my hand though against all enemies by which your day Clark and Saddamerca's war on terror. I read about 27 pages before I finally nodded off last night. Then good. How about better than the polo in your book? The only book is okay. It's got its moments, but I don't know. It just leads me kind of limp. Just like polo neo himself, please me kind of limp. You agree? Yeah. He's kind of kind of. I mean, you know, I'm not not going to be mean. He never stole a freight train, but he just had, I don't know, he ain't no Madeleine Albright. I did a favor of military action. Well there you go. See, see what I mean? She just, she just knocked him up against the wall sideways if he just gave a one dirty Look, that'd be the end of him. At any rate, Richard Clark happens to be registered Republican. Were you aware of that? Yes, I would. He's registered Republican. He worked across for four presidents, Reagan, Bush one, Clinton, and the Bushmaster two, W. And so those, that freightic attack that came out yesterday, just, I mean, hysterical, the ghost to show you man, if they are dropping some bricks up there in the out of White House. Can I still say that they're dropping bricks? I don't think so. Well, I mean, who knows, maybe there's a little construction going on. They're dropping bricks. I think I can say that. Although, Duff is probably just, Oh, gee, here when he said, Clarissa, oh my god, let's do it again. Bricks rhymes with, Hicks, right, spicks. And that's it. Don't see, don't start this game. I'm telling you right now. In fact, I have a suggestion for you. Be a friend. Yeah, yeah. If they're a friend. That's my suggestion for you. Since Greg already hates you like poison. You're a small potato's, Mr. I keep trying to tell you, mind your piece and cues. Can we say that? Well, we adults depends on what the piece stands for, but the cues stands for it. That's the operative question here. Q.A.M. Q for Q.A.M. Let's hear it. All right. And of course, queer. It stands for queer. We can still say queer. Can't wait. That's good. Can't be one. You can't be one. And you can't think about that stuff. Oh, and speak out of that. Let me get to a couple of things first. First things first. What did I just do with that? Oh, here it is. Thing you just sent me, not too important. The Miami-Dade Police Vomsquad is investigating you suspicious package. Fog near the bird road exit just east of the palm of the morning. The FHP shut down the expressway in both directions around 745 as a precaution. NBC 6 says that more information is the story develops. You might want to take a puke at their website and see what's going on. Or might even want to take a puke out on the tube there, which would be the Scraise. How does you watch the metal and all bright? Well, as a secretary of state on terrorism, we'll have Secretary Powell follow you. What percent of your time, if you can give us a rough estimation, did you spend? You had Middle East peace. Certainly, we're one of the driving forces in being a hawk with respect to co-civaled, using our military there. What percent of your time can you best estimate that you spent on counterterrorism politics? Yeah, good answer, Madeline. You go, girl. Anyway, we got a lot of stuff to do here. We don't have time for this. Those people are want to listen to the hang on every word. Have a good time doing it. Let us know what they said later. Look for the QM fan from noon to two today. It's senior hysteria located at 9019 West Pines Boulevard in Pemark Pines. Stop by and spin the prize wheel to win tickets for tonight's Panthers Devil's Game at the ODC. O'Reilly, orifice depot center, or they have that fantastic lexas park. Which makes everybody else walk about 500 yards extra so that the hot shots that travel lexas can park up real close to the escalator. Well, it's too bad, lovely. That's noon to two at senior hysteria on Pemper Pines today. Who's going to be there? Is it going to be Miguel? No, I know. Scott? Okay. Okay, what? Sure, if you say so. Well, no, is that the answer? I think so. Oh, by LeBlanc. Oh, certainly Scott will be there. Strange squirly, not surely, but squirly. He has a squirly dude with a red push and just a strange, the whole other hold on beyond. So, go over there and have a chat with Scott. And, you know, let's spin the wheel. My Winston games to the tickets to the hockey game tonight, where most people get in there for anyway. And the people I did want to pay, they're just doing everything under the sun to piss them off. I mentioned that yesterday. I also forgot to mention a stir about my neighbor. Yeah, you did. Yeah. Well, see, it didn't. It stuck in my crawl enough that I was taking a shower this morning. I thought, dang, hot, dang stuck in my crawl. I forgot how much I asked you today. Gosh darn. No, I even think of those terms now. Yeah. I don't think to myself, even in any of those words that we can't say no more. No, I just cleaned up my brain. We'll speak a little louder, speak. So, gosh darn, come to find out that John went outside to check the mail or something like that a few days ago. And, uh, one of our neighbors, I don't want to say which one exactly because, uh, I don't know. No, no, I mean, I don't, since my friend Bernie, uh, his wife passed away and he moved sold a house and moved since he moved out of the hood. I don't really have very much to do with any of the neighbors. I don't know about you, but, uh, I don't know how to deal with your neighbors either. I'm not saying that they ever stole a freight train or anything like that, but I just have nothing common with most of them people and the less I see him, the happier I am. And I'm sure they feel the same way. So, anyway, uh, this particular neighbor who ordinarily hasn't said 10 words since they lived in that house, uh, started a conversation with John and said, well, you know, uh, I see that you, uh, you must have changed your mind about selling the house because we had a foresale sign. You know that about several months ago. And, uh, yeah, it's so what he did was he took, he got tired of waiting for the real, the, the, I'm sorry, the realtor to do it. So he moved the sign, he just put it on the side of the house over on the side. Well, out of you of anybody unless you're looking for it. And, uh, she said, well, uh, I see you've got the sign over there. How long he can leave that there? And he said, uh, well, I just put it out of the way. He said, well, I'm tired looking at it. Right. Yeah. Is it in the front of the house? Oh, is it anywhere near where this person would see it unless going out of the way? No. I mean, I don't, I never heard such a thing in my life. I'm tired of looking at it. See my response would have been, I'm tired of looking at you, bitch. That would have been my responsive immediately. I mean, what kind of a neighbor is that? You don't even live in coral cables for crying out like, hey, if fact, I might just have him just lay it right out in the middle of the lawn. They're just as a protest. I don't know what that means. I know how suitable offensive the game. That's unacceptable. That's just not very neoliberal. Another nice. So, my new home business in Quittstan and on a ladder and looking at the see if you can see the For sale sign, okay? In fact, maybe it is still for sale. And if you keep it up, it will be. Keep up your crappy, too. Okay, lady. I beg your pardon. You should go nail it on there for a little bit. I think that's a great idea. In fact, the sooner they move the happy well, I'll be like, how do you like that? And I had nothing against them. I don't even know them really. I mean, just, you know, hello and goodbye. Get lost. But in any way, that was a very sad experience. That's a typical Florida experience where the people are surely hostile. Just, unfriendly folks, most of not all of them. There are a few people in South Florida. I'm tired of me. Are nice folks that you like to, you know, wine and wine with them. Maybe have a little chat, little verbal intercourse. Can I say verbal intercourse? No. Little verbal, f**k course. But, um, that ain't one of them. I find that to be just inexplicable. It's not like there was ever. Oh, she also inquired about the health of my two dogs. How are your dogs? See, can't you? So I would suggest that she's probably a little bit out of touch since they both been dead for quite some time now. They're very, very dead. And it's not like they're coming back anytime soon because they were all cremated. So if that maybe I can get the ashes still and sprinkle them on her lawn, the fertilizer would be good. You think? It's a bit of what you use for fertilizer. Uh-huh. See, there he goes again, Josh. It's very early in the show. We haven't even done the first break yet. Can't say further. Right on to that. There he go. No, no, no, no. It's a, you're talking about substance. See? That's what you're talking about. What you use for fertilizer. We know what, though, we catch your drift. I can sniff it. Talk about nitrogen. No, you're not. Here's the poll result from yesterday. With all the FCC crack going on. Neil should just keep ripping bushing ass. 1542 out of only three shy of 2300 votes. Twenty to ninety seven. That's shocking. 1542, 67.1% said, keep ripping bushing ass and I will. And even metal and all parts were thrown in ass. We're helpful. See? Keep going is bestie can for 142. Retire! 130, 5.6% that flirted there with a 6% for quite a while. And then they said, ah, that would be boring. 5.6% which is perfect because it's a 560. Do a hockey show 59. A hockey show. Go back to a bedtime story. It's 54. Where did that come from? Uh oh. Do a sports show 54 and play music. That was my vote. My first choice only 16. Dang it. See? Too much a party poopers.

Now, they're not responding to the TV show. They're responding to the book. They're responding to Dick Clark, and his American van stand. It says, if Bart Simpson says something about the present, will Ms. Rice respond? I'm aware of it, but get telling you what's wrong with that. Probably. But she'll do it only behind closed doors. Not in public. Kind of Lisa. She looks like a really, um, do I do even say it? No, no, no, I'm serious. She looks like a burnout old hooker to me. Kind of Lisa, would I gap tooth and a black eye man? She's a nasty looking bitch. You see her yesterday? Yep. And then we, then we, then we, then we, then, Wow. She was just stumbling and fumbling all over the place. Well, we got two polls for you today. Two for the price of one. First, we'll do just, I don't know, our, our in some minutes. Because I don't think we'll get to, you know, some of those we need to leave on there the whole time. I mentioned this, uh, the other day tomorrow. Tomorrow. This Supreme Court justices will hold a one hour hearing with attorneys over the meaning of the words and a pledge of allegiance, affirming that America exists under God and response that lawsuit by the gun, California. A phrase that an appeals court said a must-way religious exercise and must be omitted when public school children recite the pledge because obviously in public schools religion ain't got no place, please. Cracker, please. So we're asking today just like the apostint globe pull yesterday, although the third one I could throw a choice I guess a little bit different. Do you think the words under God should be removed from the pledge of allegiance in public schools? Very straightforward question, very easy, I think? Sure. Yes, get religion out of public schools. No, it's part of American life or who gives a Schmidt. Do you think the words under God should be removed from the pledge of allegiance in public schools? Yes, get religion out of public schools. No, it's part of American life or who gives a f***. Good flying f***. Right, crap. Or we can still say crap. Aren't you excited about that? So it's like that. The situation when the FCC has gotten so grotesque now that what we're going to get from the beastly this week is the list of the words that we still can say. It's going to be very short list. Like hello. Goodbye. How are you? Yes, stuff like that. We could just use those fun with tick and chain books. Oh, look at this already. No, it's part of American life or 11. Who gives a Schmidt 10? And yes, get religion out of public schools. Seven. That's interesting out of the first 28 votes. Huh. But of course, it's American example. Pye and these people most of them are so conditioned into thinking it belongs in there, which it never was in there in the first place. One nation under God, the invisible god of yada. It was never in there. Right. I mean, if they want to say one nation under. Oh, good. That's a different story. I have no problem with that. Although we will copy right it. Make a few bucks. Now, let's see. That's our poll number one. Poll number two. Well, we'll get to it later. Because then they'll start calling in with that stuff. Now, I don't want to do that. What did I do with that thing from USA today? I give up. That you, huh? Why not what I did with it? I folded it up and put it in my against all enemies book. I don't want to do that. We've already, Eric has already got away for good out for us to raise some cash. And I will say this. It's not going to be one of these deals where all well is it going to be a not for profit organization. So we can deduct it from our taxes. No, we don't have time to register and go through all of that stuff. Do we know? You don't want to know? No. No. Now, we don't have time for that. So if you want to donate because you think you're going to get a tax rebate on your 50 bucks or 10 bucks or whatever, forget about it. And the next, sometimes the next few days will tell you exactly how we're going to do this. USA today requires only a couple of days advance notice for ads. We got their national rate card. And a quarter of paid black and white ad in the USA today, Monday through Thursday, cost $31,600. How much? About 30 grand a little bit more than that. So I'm confident if I put in the first couple of grand and then we get some other big shooters out there. And if we get a whole lot of people are really care about the first amendment and saving freedom of speech and nipping in the blood and getting this. See the purpose of it in case you tuned in the middle of this whole deal we're doing. The purpose is to get a million signatures on Scott's petition. Scott's a guy in New York was a Howard Stern listener. Called in on Stern one day got a minute very abrupt on there, but nevertheless plugged his stop FCC dot com upside which he's doing a great job. And we're helping out. We've got a lot of for ratings to sign a petition to. And if we get a million signatures at that point members of Congress will all of a sudden open the rise and realize that people are pissed off and fired up if we still say that. And of course by then maybe we won't be able to say that but let's hope we can. I'm trying to get on that thing again and I can't do you think it's all jammed up. Stop FCC dot com. Are you on it? No I'm going now. You're going now. Well let us know when you get back. It's why? Let me give it a shot. I can't get on it. I'm not going there girlfriend. Well I'll be down. Well at the beginning of the show we had 9747 from there. And what does it say? 9757. Okay 9757. So we need 243 during the show now. Yesterday I made a bad mistake of going for 9000. And much too late. We didn't get started like about 1220. That was a bad move. I mean not that these individual numbers are really in a contest with the other states. Although we're proud number three behind Texas and California. But it's just a way of trying to motivate people and try to like reach another hurdle every day and get more and more people who are disgusted in the scared crapples. If we still say that about what's happened with as they make it up as they go along. There was a peace last night on MSNBC. But I can't tell you who really is awful. Just awful. Who's awful? And when you talk about MSNBC that covers a lot of territory. But Dan Abrams, you know the attorney, a punk, he is just horrible. He had on some broad who's on Howard Stern all the time. I don't know who she is. Some comedian. And then he had some guy that some were some crusty old guy with the bifocals that used to be something to do with the FCC. And man, I'm telling you it was the most pathetic, the most tragic thing I've ever seen in my life. I've got that issue again. But of course it always has to come back to Howard. Howard does have a good idea though. And as to get people to go after Oprah. And the thrust of the discussion was Oprah has these discussions about teenage sex. Well you know if it and in the past when people try to protest against Oprah. The FCC's response was, well if it's in a clinical discussion and if it's in that context, then it's okay. So you can discuss tossing the salad and anal sex at oral sex and masturbation and all of these things. If it's in a clinical way and not to titulate the audience, you know, full crap. See the FCC for purposes of their own censorship. Evidently decided, nobody's got a sense of humor. No, no, no. You know, that's a deal. So a lot of the stuff that we've used to do, like the fart noises, for example, which there is no, I don't care what comes out on that poll. We did. Nobody with a brain or any sense of humor could possibly be offended by that. They do it on cartoons and kids shows kids cartoons. Yes. They do it in commercials with farting horses. Some of the ideas that everything is definitely serious now. And we know what you meant by that. But well, the course you don't. Of course not. So everybody is scared to do anything at this point. So we need another 243 people to sign a petition between now and 2 or clock to get to 10,000, which would be a nice, nice hurdle to hop over. Wouldn't it? Yeah, would. In just a short period of time. So go to stop FCC dot com. If you haven't done it already. Let's go. Let's get with it. And I'm threatened. I say that's our cash. I don't mean threatened in the literal sense. But I'm a promise that this is the week. This is the week that just may be possibly that the week, the week that just may be easily corporate attorneys will get their crap together. And they'll give us a list in some of our specific. As it is now, we're just driving or flying blind. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know you mean. Look, you hop on your, you're playing the New York and about, you know, halfway up the coast. On comes the captain mode. Good morning. It's your captain. My name is Stevie Wonder. My co- captain is Ray Charles. And we're hoping that we get there safely. We're flying blind. Same thing. To which I would say, my, my, my. Let me out of here. I feel like a little worked up here this morning, which I probably shouldn't be. Let's try to calm me down. Give me all. Yeah. I'll riled up. 107 votes on a pool already. Do you think the words under God should be removed from the pleasure of lesions in public schools? Yes, give religion out of public schools. 51. Well, thank God. Good. And they're trying to get in the right answer. I hope you've given this myth 31. Or no, it's part of American life 25. Whatever that means, but I, you know, I couldn't freeze it any other way. How else could you justify it? It's a tradition. Just like slavery was a tradition. Just like, you know, all of the other bigotry is a tradition. So therefore must be okay. Like beating. Right. White beatings of tradition. Let's keep it up. 27 after 10 at five, 60 WQM if you're planning on replacing your carpets. It's going to cost you a ton of cash to put new carpeting down. Don't do it.

You heard a rumor, lost and just fell and was a tie. The time I remember was so well. But not that we watched a very brown. I have no right. All the phones were written that we had that we watched a very brown. All the people were sling in. Now that's so easy. Maybe something over me, brown was a dangerous cow. Most lived in our TV. And a child of Hitler has been the dance reality. How he's walking, he pulls on a clown. Had a hand in bread and looking calmly down. We're from learning how to explain when he's in bread. He's got my nature for some of the same. Boy, the night and pray what's perfect brown. All the phones were written that we watched a very brown. It's water singing. You're a blow or soup. But maybe for now that you take it far too. I sure was going to make him farting sounds of those cartoons. That would really get done upset. 1034 at 560 WQM. Let's take a couple thousand calls before we get to any more stuff. All right. Go for it. Good news is 9783, we're only 217 signatures away on those top FCC dot competition from 10,000 Florida and a grand total 74,836, which means we're just 164 away from 75,000, which is a far cry from where we need to get, but nevertheless 75,000 is a nice hurdle to hop over right? A week ago today when somebody turned this out of this website. They were like 41,000 signatures, so it's almost doubled in less than a week. We're getting there, but if we get that full page ad or a quarter page whatever it's going to be new I say today, I'm also thinking the national inquire. All right. Although they have a very long lead time. In addition to which I think that the people, I don't think they'll accept an ex for sign of the petition as much as I love being inquired, don't get me wrong. But a lot of the people who are reading inquire have like no teeth and they do send an ex for the signature line and stuff like that. 5,670, 5,60, pound 5,60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line QAM. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, I was listening to that car thing yesterday. Yeah. And I mean, how obvious is it? And all these other people who have blown the website on this administration, how obvious doesn't have to be for people to finally wake up. I know. I've said for a long time that Bush could all of us in walking and is hearing they're having them right now and say everything which your Clark wrote in the book was true. We were after a back in the first place and we just used 9,11 is an exusue to exploit and back to go in there and and the public and still his bushyes out there would still believe him. I mean, they wouldn't believe this until support him. It's like a movie. People and the reason again, he doesn't want to talk is because he has something to hide. It's like criminals. Right. Right. And when I was on the top of the show, I think it caught why? Because they got something to hide. And just like this administration is criminal administration. We have an asses government. You know, getting the whole world mad at him, getting them, you know, a good percentage of Americans is mad at him. That is correct. I mean, you know, just how quickly they responded to this thing. In fact, they had a story on last night that even before the interview with 60 minutes because they knew that it was coming. Condalisa had written a point by point response to what I guess they got an advanced screening of it from MoCBS. And she had written and sent to a CBS a point by point rebuttal towards your clock and then of course they brought out Cheney on with Russia. Today, they were forming at the mouth about this. They have a nervous breakdown rightfully so because it's coming out. The poll administration when they first of power, the main concern was getting this treasury. Given those attacks, all they talked about amally, were attacks on the rich. That's what big business is. Right. Sounds like Reagan and Bush wanted to be a whole world. And it's kind of like a real business. And then in the doughnuts. I'll see. They chopped this bowl. Have you seen that? I do. Uh-oh. And that ties right into the story here that you sent me. The new Bush agenda government even spying on you. They're spying on you. This last guy, sure, hope he's okay. He sounded like a pretty good guy. Hope he's still alive. The Bush administration's efforts to create a citizen's snitch core failed when Democrats in Congress got winded John Aschcroft's infamous operation tips. Americans demanded that the Senate killed George W. Bush's attempt to reward the criminals of the Iran Conference scandal by giving them authority over a massive electronic system to read Americans emails. Listen in on their phone calls, flip through the personal health records, and even keep tabs on their library card activity. Led by Democrats, the US Senate put the leash back on Bush's plans for total information awareness. You think the Bush administration would have learned Americans just don't want homeland security agents searching through information about their personal activities. We don't believe that our government is the right to spy on us, whatever it wants to. Would the defeat of these attempts by the Bush administration again unlimited spying power over American citizens? We thought we were safe. We thought that Bush asked Croft and Tom Rage and given up the fight for the right to snoop. We were wrong. Thanks to some hard work by Senator Diane Feinstein, America's learned that George W. Bush and his top 8 are still trying their daughter to be a part of the country. We're still trying their darnedest to gain the power to spy on the private lives of citizens. I'm sure they said darnedest. During a detailed review by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein spotted a single paragraph that would give the military and the CIA, the legal power to search through your credit card and bank records, your email logs, and even your telephone calls, without ever having to get a search warrant to show probable cause. According to the new plan, this information could then be legally forwarded onto the new Department of Homeland Security or directly to the White House. Whatever they want. Imagine that you're going about your daily life and George W. Bush is trying to gain the power to personally review the details of everything you do. W would gain the power to see who you said email messages to, what you're buying with your credit card and who you're calling on your own telephone. What's more, Bush could send his agents out together this information about you, even if you're not suspected of any crime. Believe it or not, the wording of this paragraph came directly from the Bush White House, this new plan for massive electronic surveillance of law-biting Americans comes directly from the Office of George W. Bush. Just what is Bush up to? Has any heard of the Bill of Rights? Has anybody told him that Americans have a constitutional protection from unreasonable search and seizure? A good quick summary of this White House insurgency is provided by journalist Richard Reeves. George W. Bush and Republican AIDS have demonstrated this strange obsession with gaining the power to spy Americans' private affairs. Just what do they plan to do with that power? When will George W. Bush and the Republicans learn that Americans don't want his goons spying on their private lives? I have a feeling he might learn that lesson in 2004. It says here. Wow. Just mention that in passing. Free anybody that might care might be concerned. And our message again, listen carefully. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Or not, is the case maybe, depending on how astup you are.

found an email from webmaster at stop at cc dot com people using a well-bels off other providers that utilize a spam trap for email needs to be checking it you need to stress this over and over again we need votes i'm a registered republican believes in less government our life keep up the good work and let me say it again this is not a partisan issue there are three republicans and two democrats on the fc right now and they're all about you're lunatics they're all rabid they're forming at the mouth and all they did was use the janit Jackson and just in think about flap at the superbowl uh... less than two seconds of partial new to the of a breast as an excuse to all of a sudden start singing dutch land uber Wallace and censoring everything we're gonna find you we're gonna fire you we're gonna take away your license this is madness is what it is and and and the obvious question is based on what well don't ask any questions we just decided what but we just made it up like they've always done they make it up as a go along that's why nobody can understand the ruling of indies and see nobody certainly understands that business of course language what the hell is that she they could say right there or you said hell that's course language everything and anything it's a catch all it's just a trap is what it is i think basically the what they would like to do is catch all of us so that they can just have rush and uh... a shun Hannity in bill or rally and a few of the right wing lunatics on here and everybody else goes by by that's it that's it see uh you finally did uh

in general what did he say i thought talking about that ad we were in uh clearance his office while he was looking at those uh prices and and that's it do we have his support meaning meaning that he

take that away then you can't make any of those noises again right right mr wipple might not be too happy about it nine eleven panel sites bush and Clinton in action that's all one word in action the Clinton and bush administration decision used diplomatic rather than military options against al-Qaeda allowed the nine eleven terrorists we loot capture years before the attacks of federal panel said today the Clinton administration at early indications of terrorist attacks to osami amama and future nine eleven mastermind kali cheek Muhammad as early as ninety five but let years pass is that pursuit criminal indictments and diplomatic solutions to subduing them abroad it found bush officials meanwhile fail to act immediately on increasing intelligence chatter and urgent warnings in early 2001 by its counterterrorism adviser Richard Clark to take out al-Qaeda targets according to preliminary findings by the commission reviewing the attacks how do you like that how do you like that so maybe he's not as lacking credibility is kind of liisa and many other rabbit right wingers would have us believe yesterday we found that the CIA and the FBI tended to be careful in discussing the attribution for terrorist attacks to bipartisan reports said the time lag between terrorist act and a definitive attribution route a month then years as the evidence was compiled hey let's do a study former representative lee Hamilton appearing on CBS is the early show that they said the commission will not make any final judgments about the Clark allegations or other assertions until it's reviewed all the evidence madeline al-Bright told the commission at president Clinton and esteemed everything we could everything we could take out based on the knowledge we had to protect our people and disrupt and defeat al-Qaeda they preliminary reports said the US government had determined been lawd was a key terrorist finance series released ninety five but that efforts to excel him from Sudan installed after patent officials determined he couldn't be brought to the US without an indictment a year later been lawd and let Sudan set up his base net Afghanistan with no resistance and a

What a very new cock isons. Look in the middle, take a picture, take a picture. Look in the middle, take a picture, take a punch. Look in the middle, take a smile. You can think what they want, sit behind your head, plains your clouds, show them if it's a scarlet or a landsっぱys that you keep on your head. Look in the middle, take a picture, take a picture.

A friend, who does what you want. Look, and they just don't love людей. Don't need money, they'll get arrested, they'll get arrested, they won't die. I'm the old 10th of Texas, you're the best guy to do what they say. What I swear, I will start myself today. This is just amazing. Anament I'll read the facts that was the inspiration for that. Wait till you hear the story that I just came across from the BBC. A Brazilian pastor has died during a screening of Mel Gibson's controversial film the passion of the Christ. Yeah. Jose Haraldos Sottis, a 43-year-old Presbyterian, had booked a whole cinema to view the film of this congregation. Aha. And guess what? He died. And you got it. God called the whole. halfway through the movie his wife noticed that he was no longer awake in a doctor in the audience confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack. Friends denied that violence scenes of Christ beating in crucifixion had caused pastors Sottis to expire. He was calmly watching the movie next to his wife said, I'm not a cost to a family friend. Mrs. Sottis noticed that something was wrong when her husband didn't reply, but she spoke them during the film. The couple's two children were also in the cinema in Bellar Horizonte, capital D, Southeastern State of Minas Jedi. Okay. I don't know. Something in Portuguese, I'm sure. Oh. The film was open in Brazil on Friday has been criticized by some of the considerable violence in its bloody portrayal of Jesus' final 12 hours and it's alleged anti-Semitism, but Catholic church leaders in Brazil have praised the patch of the Christ as an accurate narrative of the biblical events because of course they were there and they know. He died. Yep. You don't think it was an act of God. Do you? Is it everything? Wow. Yeah, put that on the t-shirt. It's meals fall. Anyway, this, the reason I played that Gandhi man, we got a bit for everything. You know, some of them would you still play? I'm good man. How do you like that? We got about 30 bits of the DCS out of about 6,000 now. We can still play. I'm not sure. It's going tough. And Clarech, you doing a hell of a job of clarifying all this for us. Get on the phone right now. Okay. Give them what for. Just scream and yell. Get on the phone to an apos and just like that. Make a good one, Oasis. And see, you're not going to stop calling them and bug them until we get to some clarification. Anyway, the fact is as we should leave it one nation under God. They're to pacify the most dangerous. 40% of Americans who live outside the coastal urban areas. The endothels who will never crawl pasted artis of their shotgun-productive caves, it's a non-issue let them head their god references. Okay. If honest and selfless our leaders are clever enough to separate church and state regardless of the green tooth demands, but our leaders are money-grubbing a leaders hypocrite or hypocritical warlords who govern them and who purposely feed them their fix of backward dribble to perpetuate their beliefs, which in turn roses all back in the same dark cave they live in. I hope there's an escape word like Alza Wahiri had there in Pakistan. Assute. A tunnel. We will all live in the squalor that's being foster orchestrated by the few self-appointed a leaders for the purpose of raising themselves above the masses. Neal can we ever get to the very achievable revelation that the most powerful and influential nation in the world can define strength by demonstrating a show of peace? No. I think we're closer and moving every near as a nation to linen than we are to Gandhi. Says he worked up to a frenzy fangser. Atheon 9840 on a signature from Florida on uh... stop fcc.com 160 to go to get to 10,000. Which would be a good start. 100 and what we got? 9847. 153 to go. What will do that one way? Easy. I'll guarantee one thing we'll do those 10,000 by two o'clock or I'm not coming back to rest of the week. That's just I don't like treading the audience, but it always seems to have a great effect, especially when I'm threatening to put you on. Sure. And they just had a couple weeks ago, a whole week a unit loved it. They enjoyed it. You were tremendous to the wonderful job. That's what Josh said. Right. Oh, that Josh. Yeah. On our clearance. Clarence can't stand you because you ain't not only don't you talk about sports, but you hate sports, you hate it. You're too much anti sports for clearance. You don't like you at all. I don't. Alex and my image says love your show and strong with support. Stop the fcc and the doing so from the first day you mentioned on your show. Thanks Alex. I emailed the link to everybody in my address book and courage evidence the same. What I think is funny is that your new list of forbidden words is not like you say the debug, but on fear factor last night in BC, one of the contestants clearly said, debug, right on prime time TV would know, believe their consequence. I just don't understand the fcc either. Well, don't Alex don't assume that the fcc told us that we can't say debug or s-bag or a hole. This is a list of words that the corporate attorneys at B'sley just pulled out of their ear or some office. It was passed along to us by a very petrified muff who's peeing his pants right now. Look at that, 594 votes on it. Pull. I wish Eric would take that down already so we can proceed with the next one. Would you please tap on a little message here? Say take the pull down already fat so and thanks for that extra link by the way, Eric. It's great. Do you think the words under God should be removed from the Pledge of Allegiance in Public Schools? That's the pull question today. The first one. Pull number one. Two pulls in one day. I got a line for that but I can't say it no more. Yes, get religion out of public schools 250, 42%. Who gives a Schmidt 133, 32.4% and know it's part of American life 151, 25.4% brainwashed to God people with God's squad. They like it that way. One nation under God, indivisible. But liberty injustice for us. That was we like, for a few. For a couple. For all good, the goose stepping right wingers, everybody else screw you. This is the best facts we've had in a long time right here. This is outstanding. Be afraid. Be very afraid. It says the headline read today is real tense to kill all of Hamas leadership. He says I'd like to thank all those Christians and Jews who love Israel so much. You made it clear to this peace loving atheist who the real terrorist are. Sign anonymous and then it says. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Oh, man, you got your thumb right on it, pal. Can we still say that? Oh, no. I didn't say on what. Everything you say now to love you. Can we say that? Look for the QM van from noon to two at senior hysteria. Look at it at ninety nineteen Westpines Boulevard and pepper pines. Stop by and spin the QM prize wheel. That's obscene to win some of our low budget and bursting prizes. And when tickets to for the night's panther double game at the Yenta Center, the panthers and the devil's the that's noon to two at the senior hysteria and pepper pines. See, it's probably not a good idea. I don't want to give advice to Alan Cohen and my friends in the panther organization my former friends. They've been pretty nice to me, but to the rest of the fans, they treat like crap and they do a lot of stupid things like that. Less is parking zone. People are pissed off about that. And when you have a team that never makes the play off. See, I was just thinking about this last night. Now that it's almost mathematical and it is a certainly the panthers will not make the playoffs again this year. They just don't make them. They've made them three times in the history of the franchise. That's that's not a very good what you call track record. If you catch my drift, okay. It's not a really good incentive for people to come out. So when you know that you're not going to make the playoffs, that the team is like the youngsters in the organization, if we're a lot of really good ones, but never less, I just can't quite not good enough for prime time. And then you go out of your way to like, see, it would seem to me also before it again when they start blaring that music for people to get there early. That somebody from the organization would go downstairs, wander around in the stands and fight out of the side of the music is so bone crushing, ear piercing, gut wrenching loud that people can't even hear themselves think and it's hurting their ear grump. I'm really happy I did to give the high sign up, say, hey cut that back a little bit, okay, schmuck. 19 till noon at 5.60 QAM. My, my local ear sports video 5.60 QAM. It's day in Miami town of Bootin at 5.60 WQA. He's an American music icon, the original country punk. And now he's reaching across the Atlantic to pay tribute to England's greatest punk band. It's the best of Johnny Clash. The show's ready, the whole like it. Walking, the Casbah. The man in black is back. I'm track with a very special version of Train and Vane. Did you stand by me? No, not at all. Did you stand by me? No way. Yes, London's calling. And they're saying hello to the best of Johnny Clash. If I go there will be trouble. And if I stay in Willby, double. Hello, this is Johnny Clash. And I shot this commercial in Reno just to watch you buy. My brand new record. So you got all that mean. Should I stay? Or should I go? The best of Johnny Clash. Look forward in the combat country section of your local record store. Hey, Johnny. Okay, Johnny. Take care yourself. I just discovered something astonishing. I got a new hobby now. Okay. This is unbelievable. I thought I knew a little bit about the internet. But I don't know crap. Do you know that you can actually, which one of these things do I have to click on? Here it is. You can search the traffic on any website that you wanted. Did you know that? You did? More at Walgreens with the Alexa toolbar. It's easy. Right. It lacks a fantastic. It is the best of us. Anyway, let's not want to get into that right now. But that could kill like a whole life. You wouldn't have any time to do anything. You're just looking in search and reading and dittling around. Pretty interesting. Anyway, what American entertainment family do you think is the best of all time? Or I suppose that's our second pull question. Before we get to the results so far, which we just tripping a few vote. 98.54. That's the latest total of I see on stopfcc.com from Florida. 98.64. Like I said, see? What that means, we mean another 136 will make 10,000 in about a week. That's pretty good. Consider what a bunch of lame assa deadheads most globally in ZAR. 9864. I'll take you to the people are really ought to be on this and be assigned it up as the people at lost stern on big. And let me also remind you, which we don't do it often enough. If you go to the arangers.com and you're through looking at our naked picture that they were Becker gay heart. Be hath the beaded curtain. You can look back on there and see which are the eight stations there that you might accidentally listen to. Never listen to again. The clear channel station in South Florida. Don't listen to them. And positively absolutely don't ever tell anybody that you listen to those stations because something evil will happen to you. You'll die and go to hell. What they did. Right. Mike says, I'm a 55 year old white man. I never voted. I consider myself fairly liberal. The next is for me was when Ascroft drape draping something or statues and cloth. God forbid we should see a breast. I'll vote for Kerry. God knows he's a piece of terror. But consider the alternative. There you go. My God. Bad. And then somebody about one nation under God. He lists several of the gods. So the gods of all these different religions, Judaism, Bahai, Spiritism, Sikhism, Kuchikuchi, Kuchikuchi, Shinto and so on. We get, I get the message. Thanks a lot, KP. Cheerio and Medita Springs who just is out of control says, I'm sure somebody else was to just the founders today. That's a great one. That's why I won't read just them. He'd like to vote for the caradines. God was great as a preacher Casey and the grapes of wrath. Look if we're getting David Curating is in Kung Fu. A lot of people like to forget he said that they still remember Keith Curating is not seen in the new HBO series Deadwood. I haven't seen Robert Curating in a while. Maybe it's his turn to dry out. Yes, the caradines may all be crazy, but I like their work. That's a great family there, Jerry. Just like they see on the family feud. Great family. Even though you're dumb and you lost the show, but never another great family. Good answer. Or like they said when Richard Cart said Iraq had nothing to do with the 9-11. Wrong answer. The buzzer went off. Wrong answer. Can you believe that? Do you believe that? Do you believe they flew in what's his name? Special Richard. Richard, what's his name? Richard? Not Richard from family feud. Oh, that wrong answer Richard. Dawson? Dawson? How come we both had a little brain fart there? Richard Dawson? All the drinkin? Trying to forget. How many of you have been here? Hello? Hello, Van Nio, not you. Yes, sir. Hey, good afternoon. Good afternoon. I'm not sure what time it is. I do need to. No. Please forgive me. I'm not sure if you've already covered this turf with your poll question regarding the Pledge of Allegiance. But I believe those two words and questions were not originally in the Pledge of Allegiance. That is correct, sir. That is correct. Isn't that something? But now that it's there, it's like a new, it's a new holy war. Right. That's the God squad had those words inserted. I think during the Eisenhower years they had that inserted. Look at the Eisenhower. Yeah. I don't know. My job McCarthy was like a conner, but a communist. Yeah, it's right. So the FCC, can we change the spelling of that organization? Maybe to ask. Yes, sir. I already have five, six, six. You count five, six. You count five, six. The only AT&T. And Verizon Wireless line. I think we got cut off from that guy. You're going to go in, hello. Deal. Yes, sir. How you doing? Pretty good. I have a suggestion for the poll or for the family family. Go in ahead. In the family. How about I know one that you've really like, Mo Howard, curly Howard, Shem powered. Yeah, the three stuages. There you go. Sensational. Sensational. Absolutely. That's a lot, pal. Thank you. And don't forget, I'm listening. 24 hours of coming to Newpool. Get out of there, Mo. Get lost. I'm still at the end of the evening. Where did he get in? Hold on. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't really. I don't listen that much, but they're really into it big time. I think it had to do with that little handicapped girl or something in his comments about how she hates Joel. Oh man. This Mo, you talk about an old turret who will just never grow up. Hello, perhaps never grow up, and never has never even began to be close to being a human being. If you wonder why everybody in the building hates you, Mo, just look at the mirror. 44 votes.

Bush the one person knows more about a solid been law than alcada than anyone else in his country he devoted two decades of his professional life to combat in terrorism Richard Clark served seven presidents and worked inside the White House for George Herbert Walker Bush bill Clinton and George W. Bush until he designed March 2003 he knows better than anyone the hidden successes and failures of the Clinton years he knows better than anyone while we failed to prevent 9-11 he knows better than anyone how president Bush reacted to the attack and what happened behind the scenes in the days that followed he knows whether or not or not a representative terrorist threat to the United States and whether that were hidden cost of the invasion of that country most disturbing of all our Clark's revelations about the Bush administration's lack of interest now caught a prior to 9-11 from the moment the Bush team took off his decided to retain Clark in his post as the counter-terrorism star Clark tried to persuade them to take alcada seriously as had bill Clinton for months he was denied the opportunity even to make his case to Bush encountered key officials who gave the impression that they had never heard of alcada who focused incessantly on Iraq who even advocated long-discuited conspiracy theories about Adams involvement in previous attacks on the US. Clark was the nation's crisis manager on 9-11 running the situation room a scene described here for the first time and then watched in dismayed what followed. After ignoring existing plans to attack alcada when he first took office George Bush made disastrous decisions when he finally did pay attention. Coming from a man known as one of the hardliners against terrorist against all armies is both a powerful history of our two decades on confrontation with terrorism and a serving in debtment of the current administration I'm just going to read one paragraph okay from the first how many pages have I read? But third man! And he's describing what happened in the moments after the attacks? Can I get to this one page? When later in the discussion secretary Rumsfeld noted that international law allowed the use of force only to prevent future attacks and not per retribution, Bush nearly bid his head off. No the president yelled in the narrow conference room. I don't care what the international lawyer say. We're going to kick some ass. And look, this is for 236.

Why would they? Because they went to work for Clear Channel. That was their worst mistake ever. Clear Channel bought out the station that they were on. And that was the Kissedette for poor Rick and Seth. That was the end of them. So I mean, I'm not even an A.M. Station anywhere we're taking them up. David, I mean, they've been on the Beach a long time man. Listen, Neil, how you still live in Tampa? That's why I first started listening to you guys. I'm sorry. No, what's your, your taste?

Uh, for about a week, yeah. Yeah. I guess there's all high, huh? I think they suck. I mean, I just be honest with you. If I thought they were any good, I would tell you, but I thought they were pathetic. And then you notice when I came to Miami, Ron Diaz didn't even have the balls to, uh, to be with a show. He just disappeared off the coast of Rico somewhere and vanished into no man's land. Well, that was life time of age, I think. That, that, he was making jokes about that on the air. So when I had nothing to do with his lifetime, he was making jokes about that just like, uh, some other guy that, who's the guy that they had on the morning with, uh, Ron, uh, Bennington? He was making jokes. He was, who was it? Bill Hayes. He was making, no, no, that's not the one. Well, I'm glad they had on there was making jokes about his handicap kid. Remember that? Billy Hayes.

Ron and Fez is somewhere and D.S. came back someplace else. I don't know. I know that I really enjoyed their manager Tommy Cramer who didn't do drugs in the 60s when everybody else did.

I don't know the Amiel Zola story. Civilization will thrive when the last stone from the last church falls on the last priest. Oh, that's the best. This of course could apply to our original. I'm saving that civilization. Well, thrive when the last stone from the last church falls on the last priest. That's good stuff, man. Wow. Or when the last altar boy falls on the last priest.

But nevertheless, nice try. How about the Eglacy's family? Somebody says the Eglacy is not the like, right? That's bad. And then for a lot of not, you know something? What? Speak of the Eglacy's.

Nazion, Harriet, Rick and David, and the kids, and all of the long here in all of these things. The Nelson's. What's not to like? It's a special thing. No smoking forces taking new territory, the Beesh. Ten years after California said a national precedent by banning smoking and restaurants and bars, and months after prohibiting it within feed of government buildings and playgrounds, many of the state's coastal cities, and out banning smoking at the Beesh. Health and environmental officials say the moves are a logical extension of smoking bands and other publics. And our necessary to meet state and federal anti-pollution requirements. Some legislators have referred to the government as trying to far into private lives, with our necessary and overly pure technical victims. So, Lanna Beesh was the first California city to ban smoking at the Beesh when it enacted as prohibition lines of timber, saying, for many imposed a similar ban last week, Santa Monica's likely to follow suit on Tuesday and in Sanitus, they vote on the issue within a month. With a momentum of early victories and a smoking activist or a technique arguments to other coastal cities, from San Diego to Manhattan Beach, or most of the beech heading to Beesh, Newport Beach and beyond, Los Angeles is also graphing in those smoking ordinance for Venice, Doc Wiler will Rogers and Cabrillo Beach as well, Cabrillo. Whatever, I don't know. This really is a very basic issue, which is that the community is standing up to protect its youth and citizens from tobacco smoke and litter, said Judy Strang, executive director of Youth tobacco prevention corps, a group of teen activists that set the legislation motion two years ago at Solana Beach. The group would seek smoke free beaches, parks and recreation areas, approach three city councils in 2002 for provisional one week ban, as it goes on and on and on and on and on so sad. So sad. Let's start punishing the smokers. They're addicted and nicotine, just like us fat people are addicted to refined carbohydrates, but nobody wants to believe it. And I still say with all these gigantic antide tobacco company lawsuits, that when they decided to throw out the lawsuits again, of course that was the big business people. I was the Republicans. Oh, you can't see McDonald's anymore. Tant's who Burger King, why not? At least not for a dickening you to their food because they decide because they said, what do you mean why not? Are you starting again? Yeah. Shame on you. 560560 pound five 60 on the AT&T in Parisomar, let's line. Don't forget the QM fan right now with the anxious Scott. Go take a look at that.

Yeah, let's put them on or even I can't stand either one of them. He's nested porters too. Oh, like I said, the Van Dyke family. Study, cutting calories extends like a study in my suggests that a low calorie die could help extend life even if the dietary change doesn't start until all day. The study appearing this week in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that mice that they relatively advanced age of 19 months that were placed in a restricted calorie die live 42% longer than littermates who continue to be the standard die at littermates. Other studies have shown that young mice put on low calorie die live much longer than mice fed the standard fair, but the new research suggests it's never too late to enjoy a life extension benefit by reducing calories. Cut the fat. Stephen R. Spindler, the University of California Riverside leader of a team conducting the research said, there's little evidence yet that dietary restrictions will extend human life but in mice at least, sensible eating even at older ages, purely has longevity benefit. He said in 19-month-old mouse's age equivalent of 60 to 65 years in old in humans. So, in other words, don't feed your mouse too much. Spindler said old mice placed on a restricted calorie die responded quickly with better health med eventually the animals lived up to six months longer than littermates fed the standard die. If such findings translate to humans he said, this could mean a lot more years and a lot of good years than mice on caloric restriction live longer and they were healthier. Oh, right, I like that. So cut the fat. When it's out, cut it out. How are we doing on stop at CCL.com? Let me look, let me refresh. Let me take a look at that. Stop the miserable obnoxious disgusting as I'm seeing.
