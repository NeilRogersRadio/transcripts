Maybe we'll extend it tomorrow. Because I'll tell you my choice in this poll. I'm going to get any votes beside mine. Right. How did you, let me give the poll question. What celebrity or well known person is your all-time sexual fantasy? And being the old fact that I am in just, I guess coincidentally, what inspired me to do the poll today was watching Christine last night, came on screen TV. Christine with the Keith Gordon and the very lovely Alexander Paul, by the way. Now, how come nobody ever talks about her? I do all the time. She's hot, man. She is beautiful. She is. She played the girlfriend who unfortunately in the end had to get in the, get in the thing there. What was that? Into the thing there. Or cliff? Okay. Sure. Yeah. That was a tractor of folk with what was that? You're into these horrible, you were my 10. Well, whatever it was. She was with John Stockholen. John Stockholen was my choice because he just a fine, all-American young man. At least he was back in those days, back in the day. And we didn't have far, so we didn't have farming equipment where I was. He was also in the top gun with Tom Cruise. He was in losing it. Yes, he was. And he was also in my science projects. John Stockholen. See, I'm tongue-tied. I can't even say it. I'm so excited. He don't look all that great right now. He's 43. He's a writer director. He's a writer of the movies, but he was a fine fine. He was a fine in my mind. So that's my choice and your choice was Jessica Beale. Jessica Beale. Yes. Right now that I think about it, maybe I'll vote for Howard Beale. Jessica Beale. Good choice. Maybe the beast would like to toss one in there. I'd have to go with Brittany. Brittany Spears. Well, sooner or later she was going to go on there. Brittany, but you know, she's going to win. Yeah, she don't need any help from us. So there's the beast choice. So what celebrity are well known person is your all-time sexual fantasy. We got John Stockwell. Jessica Beale and Brittany Spears. So far. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T line.

With good old bandar Bush. The Weinstein's who run mirror Max films bought the rights to the movie from the Disney company which owns mirror Max and refused to distribute Fahrenheit 911. The Weinstein brothers will personally find answering control distribution and marketing they say yesterday. I'm grateful to them that everyone who wants to see it will not have a chance to do so more sudden this statement on behalf of my stellar cast. GW Dick Rummy Coney and Wolfie. We thank this incredible coalition of the willing for bringing Fahrenheit 911 to the people. Disney cheap executive. At least he is for the present moment and we despise him like poison. I swear. Michael Eisner said the company that won a film in the middle of the political process because he believed that Team Park and entertainment consumers don't look for us to take sides. What are convenient excuse? I swear. That is. In the settlement reached last week the Weinstein's repair repair their parent company for all cost of the film to date estimated around $6 million.

My friends, I'm sure that Halle Berry is a lovely meager in the fun actress as well as Chuck Berry with his jungle music.

And in the Regenium Orleans at the PPP Park at 105, you got the Humper at the Belmont after the Ball game. Then that's set of clock tonight proving that nothing is perfect. We got the big at the Dolphin banquet no less. What's he going to be doing eating? I don't know. What is that if a Dolphin banquet, we are just pathetic and we apologize in advance, 10 o'clock it's at a K and then overnight. Vanessa, what if somebody says, where you're roughly, that's good. Because we don't have a lot of time. So let's build this. Let's get a city of names on here because not everybody. This is going to be difficult. Not everybody's got the ultimate same sexual fantasy, right? Although Brittany has expected his shots of the top. So to speak. Alex says, how about Pam Anderson? I think he did that just to piss off George. He can have my port. Well, he's thinking back in the day when she looked pretty good and you have to did that I admit that there was maybe a moment maybe a half an hour in her life right between the ages of eight. Whatever. But you know, and then he's also broken. Joe Pissie, Penn stabbing scene is definitely from casino, not good fellows. Oh, thanks. I'll mention that in more OK. Please. It doesn't sound like this. Other people like Pam Anderson. What? Anybody can like her as long as I don't have to. We wish him the best. Right. Sophia Vergara. Absolutely. What do you mean? Absolutely. It's their fantasy. You don't. I mean, if you want to reinforce it, that's fine. I mean, we want to go. I want to go. I want to go. No. Maxwell who's a screaming fag says, from your favorite limey queen, Maxwell from Surfside. I favorite of all time, sexual fantasy is a local boy who did well. Adam Stannians. Now, there actually is such a person. Another one of these lifeguard, boy. He has made a number of local films, but struck Peter in the watermelon chronicles. I remember that. That was my favorite. The watermelon chronicles back in 1984. And then it says, wow, whatever local nation points, top-toe Maxwell tots. See you at the pot. 5, 6, 7, or Chalabi tipped their ran about codes. We got to stick some of this stuff in there. I got to interspersed even though we're very sure on time today. Ahmed Chalabi, real slime bag. Can we still say that? I just did. Yeah. Yeah. That's new espag word slime bag. Former Iraqi ex-Aherisseli lost his standing as a special friend of the Bush administration. So many special friends. And they're all such wonderful, upstanding people like Kenny Boyle, all of that crowd. Tooled around that the US had broken the code of its intelligence service, going to broadcast and published reports. CBS News initially reported Tuesday that Chalabi had told an Iranian intelligence official that the United States had cracked its codes, allowing US agents to read a rans secret communications. Revealing such information would expose one of the US's most important sources of information about Iran. I think that following the broadcast report the New York Times, L.A. Times, the Washington Post followed with similar stories all quoting anonymous US intelligence officials. So here's a guy who's spying for the much hated Iranians, which the whole reason that we back saw them in the first place to CIA and Iraq was to achieve that stalemate.

From Friday, June 4th, Amores couples can call a telephone number. 6, 9, 6, 9, 6, 9. That's the number. An white band featuring a large red condom with wings as a logo will deliver them a packet of 10 prophylactics. Just 69, 3 times. Dial it. That is. We need to increase the usage of condoms and Carl Asvald, marketing manager for the Swedish Organization for Sex Education, the non-governmental organization behind the initiative. It's 50% of our pregnancy and 50% about sexually transmitted diseases. The ambulance's will operate in Stockholm and the seven cities of Malmo and Gotonberg. The service aimed at young people who run until June 25th, the available between 40-1.9 and 9.9. A packet of 10 condoms will cost 50 crowns, which is about $6.72. Less than the cost on average in the shop, so that's only $67 a piece. A bargain. The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases increasing rapidly in Sweden and not enough young people are using condoms. Asvald said, we need to change attitude to condoms.

Anyway, a radio station suspended its airing of an ad for black Republican Congressional candidate, Vernon Robinson, that rails against illegal immigration signs off in Spanish with awards. Yol Gringo. This is in Winston, Salem, North Carolina. Your territory. North Carolina. Yol Gringo. WSJS, AM, said it made the decision over the holiday because it was unclear if the sponsor was clearly identified. The otherwise English ad, which contends the prevalence of Spanish spoken in the West can make Americans feel like they're in the twilight zone. Only the final line is in Spanish and words the translate to, Yol Gringo, this episode of the twilight zone was paid for by Robinson for Congress. Robinson said Tuesday that the tagline was intended as a way to underscore his message, but he grudgingly agreed that the station edited into English. The catchphrase, Yol Gringo, I contends to a Spanish term for Americans, remains. There's nothing in a regulation that says you can't run an ad in Spanish on a policed radio station said Robinson. Why did he's considering finding a complaint with the FC and C? FCC spokesman, Rod Royce said he didn't know immediately whether there was a requirement on the language of political ed disclaimers. WSJS manager Tom Hammelon said other political ed were temporarily suspended on the station until the problem with Robinson's ad was resolved yesterday. In a statement Robinson said the flap over the last line does not change the overall message of the ed to show the importance of securing our borders stopping the illegal immigration invasion and making English the official language of the USA.

He was okay. He was kind of fun, right? Tug McGraw, the old Tugger. Twelve minutes after, twelve minutes after 11 at five, 60. Q and we got the Marlins on deck coming up at 12 30, but at 11 30, we got those Transcum and baby and there are people in that building and all through the radio industry. We're carrying a heavy load as I speak. My life and low, this is for 205. Two and a half. Let me remember, I think I think of big o'plippers on what I think of the coverage. It's even better than it is. Oh, well, we got it. It's got a few rules. We got the week out, one and a half. One of them were drawn on one very wide. We're gonna be going to like my mom and I have a pretty face. Good and shingy because nothing is true. It's all matter of opinion, baby. No matter who you choose. Well, I'm just like the little different friends. We're gonna be all along John Steve and Tyos, but by the way, if I do you a full thing, I'm out the way. Oh, where am I going? No, I'm just even talking. You asked for, and you've always made me want to shoot myself with a gun please go away. Ooh, friends, a little purple, baby. So don't move in the old and no glue. Ooh, I agree with it, baby. I'm much taller than clay and much cleaner than the root band. I'm a choice free. Ooh, that's a nice effect. I won't have to kick in my teeth. Oh, it's really mild. I can't watch that's great. Oh, hell, without hearing your crawling little shriek. Who brought your knives? They stole the funding, they're no reason. Ooh, you're certainly welcome, I am sure. I'm not that you've gone you must be really. Oh, you can't laugh some props to it going. Just like a warm summer time breeze. Like a warm breeze over my bare butt dog. You're about to go. I'm out the door. There's a hero more. Oh, we're gonna run just even though he has bad vibe. If only to you are someday I'd have more way. Please, dear, the harmony is maybe all hard work for Jones. We're gonna run just even though you had fun. You boys, maybe one of you myself will have gone. You guys go away. Ooh, I found that bloody humor. You sure know who be on the same. No, no, no. The ones out. 1118 at 5.60 WQAM Marlins Baseball 1230 Pre-Game. I don't know how to spell Marisa Tour May. That's obvious from the facts. It says TORME would do, but I'll line her biological plug. She was in a movie that I don't think we can say the name of it on the year anymore. The Tom Kee movie? Oh yeah, no, we can't. Can we say, ready, got no finger? No, we can't say that. Okay, to think about it. Anyway, Nadine says, who's just obsessed with Johnny Depp and is just, for Morris Plains, who jersey Nadine the Queen. She says, what a bummer to have to write and rewrite my letter appropriately. I can only imagine the hoops that you book a bride and staff need to go through to do the show during this rain or fear and censorship. What surprises me is how quiet all the local New York City radio personalities are regarding censorship. They don't come near the quality of your show, your excellent town or your sophisticated website. They suck. Oops, can I say that Nadine says the answer is no. For your pull hands down, his pants Johnny Depp is my love since he was 12. As I've told you in the past, my daughter Julie's boyfriend and Miramar is that in Sestuas who cares? Anyways, his Johnny's already on a poll. How about Tom Welling, Mr. 14? And then it says, Daddy can't ain't small potatoes either. Well, I haven't seen him, but I'm surprised nobody has said that. Some lady or some queen? Well, there he are. Huh? They did now. They did now. Well, not a talk about Tom Welling, talk about John Schneider from back in the day. From that awful, awful, awful one of the all-time more shows in history. So bad that even as good as he looked, that's what he doesn't have to. But it is on again now. It's on one of those retro stations that you don't get. Somebody says, well, we got two here for Beyonce. Got that? Got it down now, Beast? Are the other. Good. Van Diesel. Ha ha. Van Diesel. Van Diesel. Van Diesel? I know who it is. We've been on as the Indian of our polls. We just relax. Jesus, you're starting to get like a Marvin the Rom man. Remember what happened to him? No. Van Diesel, believe the Williams, and also Beyonce, has also Serena Williams as well. Okay. All right. Somebody says, Ellen Nordgren spelled very badly. Tiger Woods, Beyonce, thank you Rob. Put you up a little line, Screlling. Charlize, but on. Well, what's not to like? So that's good. We're getting a lot of facts on this because time is a waste in man. Look at this. It's already 11 to 11. Can you imagine the sounds coming out of the programming office? That programming office is probably a few and some out right now. Sound that we can't play there anymore. Craig Unger writes the greatest scape in New York Times. It's short, but I got to get it in. Oh, you're going to read something. Yeah. Americans who think the 911 commission is going to answer all the crucial questions about the terrorist attacks are likely to be sorely disappointed, especially if they're interested in the secret evacuation of Saudis by planes of began just after 911. We knew that 15 out of 19 hijackers were Saudis. We knew that Osama bin Laden, Saudi was behind 911. Yeah, we didn't conduct a police investigation of the departing Saudis of whom 2,000 were members of the bin Laden family. That is not to say they were complicit in the attacks. Unfortunately, though, we may never know the real story. The investigative panel has already concluded that there's no credible evidence that any chartered flights of Saudi Arabian nationals departed the US before the reopening of national airspace, but the real point is that there were still summer strictions out of American airspace when the Saudi flights began. In addition, new evidence shows that the evacuation in Bobber than the departure of 142 Saudis on six charter flights that the commission is still investigating. According to newly released documents, 160 Saudis left the US on 55 flights immediately after 911, making a total of about 300 people left with the apparent approval of the ambush administration for more than's been reported before. The records were released by the Department of Homeland Security Response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by judicial watch, a conservative nonpartisan watchdog group in Washington. The vast majority of the newly disclosed flights were commercial airline flights not charters, often carrying just two or three Saudi passengers, originated from more than 20 cities, including Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, and Houston, one Saudi Arabian Airlines flight left Kennedy airport September 13 with 46 Saudis. The next day, another Saudi Arabian Airlines flight left with 13 Saudis. The panel is indicated that it's yet to find any evidence that the FBI checked the manifest of departing flights against its terror watch list. The departures of additional Saudis raise more questions for the panel. Richard Clark, the former counterterrorism, is our told to Hill newspaper regionally, that it took full responsibility for approving some flights, but we don't know if other Bush administration officials participated in the decision. The passenger should have been questioned about any links to Osama bin Laden or his financing, we've long known that some faction in the Saudi al-Aliwis helped funnel money to hislamist terrorist inadvertently at least, Prince Ahmed bin Salman, who has been accused of being an intermediary between Al-Qaeda and the House of Saud, boarded one of the evacuation planes in Kentucky, was he interrogated by the FBI before he left? If the commission dares to address these issues, it'll undoubtedly be accused of politicizing one of the most important national security investigations in American history and an election year or less, but if it does not, it risk something far worse to be trail of the thousands of people lost their lives that day, not to mention millions of others who want the truth. That's written by Craig Unger in the Atimes that he's asked to rob House of Bush House of Saud, which is one of about six people that got piled up in the other room, and instead I'm reading them like all at the same time. I mean, yeah, little of this, little of this. Yeah, exactly. The chapter over here, a few pages over there, it's going to be easy to get it done. Okay, let's take a look at that pull. Let's take a peek at it. We only got seven minutes till those numbers start coming out. Oh, wow. Just hang on tight, though. Hang on to Clarence tight.

Thank you. But unlike Zack you. You still got such a... I feel just like that you are my dear brother. And what you need to do with none. That's why you are still not buying. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm on a show and put you in a kitchen. You're just too much of a little fun. Not all right, that's enough. Level 32 is 28 to 0.560 WM-1230. It's Marlon's on deck. Reds at the Marlon's at P.P. Park at 105. The Humper from the Bellmottage 4. And we got the big... Oh, 7 tonight. Any canterr with that. The Bockel finishes. I don't see any stuff but puking off the fax machine yet. No, I ain't got nothin'. Nobody's come rushing in there yet and say, Oh, guess what? I'll be damned. Maybe they're kind of like covering over the fax machine. You think? I'm sure. Maybe they're just hanging out together. Clurrence and the... Duff. Well, we'll see. It should be intimate. And now I got a great brainstorm. But that is once the number star come in, since it just rest me. Beast hasn't got anything to do with that point. It's seven we do the breaks. So the beast will take your calls off the ear, right? And maybe we're... What? Come on, boom. I bet you pardon. I thought that was a spectacular idea. What's wrong with that? This guy even hooked up. I don't think the head's there. He's not in here. It's not even hooked up. We're gonna hook you up, okay? That's fine. Let's go. Here we go. The one at Randy left here on Markon. As a matter of fact, why... Why just today? Why just today? Why? Because the beast happens to be there today. That's why. But I think everyday the beast should take all our calls off the ear. They're the whole thing. That's right. Josh thought he'd come up with ideas. How to keep Dave in, boring, a wick, and other strain out his therapies. So Josh can't be bothered with that. Plus Josh is still busy trying to figure out how to sabotage Eric. So we can get involved, make some money off that website. But in meantime, Beast think about much going on. I'm sorry. And I thought it was a good idea. Because otherwise we'll have a short list. Then I'll say, well, gee, when you get by on the way. I'm sorry. Short list of the 700 names up there. Well, that's not enough. There's even infantices out there in Randy Orlando, man. And believe me, you ain't one of them. And either, he threw up the rest of us. Wow. What I'm motley looking crew. I don't know. I'm sure that there are some people out there while they're listening to show. Oh, they're pretty pretty worked out. Well, somebody could just came in. Yep. Okay. So now the Beast will take your calls and edit whatever your choice is to our list. Well, we have ponder-robedies numbers. Who just popped in there, Duff? Yeah. And what's that look on his face? Is it good? Good. Good. Good. There you go. Nice going. Duff. I'm coming to the without you, Duff. It's not for baby. Lacks once again. Oh. Okay. Just come down now. So we'll see how these numbers plan. Now this is just a trend. This is February March and April. I could explain to you how these radio ratings work again. They got a big 10 gallon head. And they stick a whole bunch of numbers in there. And they just pick out names or radio stations. It's kind of like the drop for the Yavelma. You know, I don't want to blow the surprise. But our morning guys beat big. Well, so we're going up and the small 106 formerly big takes the, oh, brother. That takes the pipe and keep in mind. That's still a gluten February. When big had a 9 9 with sternon there, okay. It's February March and April. So can you imagine when the next trend comes out? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's going to be deadly. For, and then they'll say, well, and we got Paul and Ron in there now to go. Those numbers back up. Yeah. Well, goose this. Okay. Man. That is really something. And you know, I can just wait for Howard Cohen in the hero tomorrow. Right. Well, I don't know if I'll remember to play it. Oh, hello. How would you know? What's the secret government agency? Welcome to the federal community. You look like a bad black man. I think cold. Just stand there and get stabbed. You must put your hands on the pants of the woman. Don't you care. I think you're going to give it to the light. And we have the life of the school. You've never done it. You've never done it. Look at the end of the year. How do I kill it? Hell, John. Wow. Now, bam, Duffham, a radio near you. Exactly. So anyway, thank goodness that they want to see say taking a big hit because their clear channel put all those stir pulls turn off all their stations. What a bunch of idiots. You people that they're all are. Have no shame. No embarrassment. Don't worry about getting it right. Just put a bunch of crap. Just fill up some space in between the ads. That's all it is. Like worry about whether there's anything. Huh? Like us. Man, well, now you got a good point there. Well, at least we try to be a little bit accurate once in a great while. You know, like our very scientific pole. Is the beast taking the names off the air or not? He left. He's gone. What do you mean he left? He ran out of the door. He said come back. He wasn't serious. He left. Why was that such a bad idea? No, he's still here. But it is a bad idea. Why is that? It sounds like gratuitous work for no good cause. Okay. That's work. Just taking people off the air after you're not going to do it. We're not going to do it. And then you decide whether you want to stick it on there or not. That's all. That's the thing in my name. You're not a lady. You lazy fat turnover. You know, one of your despised in the building. Why does that mocan get along with you? No matter Joe wanted you off of that show. Faster and you can say, uh, salami sandwich. Well, that sounds pretty good. You know, salami and Swiss sounds. Hmm. Sounds great, but it sounds pretty good on Rhino less. Now, let's see. I'll give it me. The reason I'm stalling is you want to give me the 12 plus numbers. That's what we got. That's all we have. I understand that. They always bring us these first. And these are the least important cause 12 plus reigns. We're not a party in everybody from the age of 12 up to a 155 from little tiny kids to Methuselob. Who cares about that? We could pretend they matter. Well, we don't. WCMQFM is number one. But they went down from a six to a five seven. That's not much of a drop dropping off that big January. Damn it. That must be because that year, most shortscrug they got on. Power stayed right there at five five number two. Good old power. Good old. What's his name? Kids. That's not 105 4.9 and this no change. No changes. Life dropped a little bit. There. I'm seeing anything going on here. EDR dropped from a fifth or two went up from fifth to a time for fourth. A radio man V went up. Also, we got another heavy spick trend here is what we got. Radio man V old. But old spicks. 3. It up to a 4.2. A radio on more. 4.3 to before. 2.WMI B. 4.4 on very little change here. Man. Very flat. Kist 360 with 3.5. What else? WQM on here. 12 plus. I would D3 2 down to a 2 7. Uh oh. QM2 into a 2 4. Well, they dropped a little bit and we went up a little bit in 12 plus. So how do you like that? We'll take it. We'll take it. Big 2 out of a 2 oh. But again, that's not it. See any and their Howard Colonel say, oh, there's no more change on big. They stated at a 2.0 share. You don't understand or ratings and you're writing them what's supposed to be a major market newspaper. Whoever you are, Howard Cohen. Boy. His name is probably Lipschutz. Anyway, oh, here we go in the morning. Drop to dump that. Have you heard of it? How are you doing? What do you just say? Are you crazy? That's a name, man. You know? That's a name like Van Diesel. Or you guys are like a little bit emotional. Are you kidding me? Okay, here we go. 6 to 10 a.m. Hot 105. Number one. A radio mum B. Number two. Oh boy. And again, this is 12 plus and who's all those old beeners. Four six to a five point. Oh, I'll write you a mum B. Radio on more. Okay, let's forget about. Let's cut to the chase. Okay. Let's see about the station's anybody cares about. Radio, romance. Look at that. M.I.B. Where does anybody? Again, it's 12 plus. Why do you do this to me? W.I.O.D. Three, four, and a morning down to what? Two, seven. How do you like that? Yeah. We love it. Q.A.M.1.8 up to a 2.4 12 plus. All right. Oh, this must be what Duff was talking about. And big one from a 2.7 out of a 2.2. There were on a 2.2 over there. Probably old polys were an acting. He's wearing a 2.2. But again, these are numbers that mean absolutely nothing to anybody. Oh, God. And in a mid-date, we'll take it. You know, if we get a little goose in there, which I doubt. Let's say, or Duff's. Huh? Three, five, up to three, seven, and a mid-day. It's not even enough to talk about. Doesn't really mean much, you know? 12 plus. But CMQFM is still number one. But from a 7.5 to a 6.5, so all those rigged dire. I mean, I'll let the baloney day head before it's starting to wear off. That month, the January disappeared. CMQFM-I.S. I think Bill Tanner is responsible for that. Even though it is the Tanner building, we have nothing but content for Miss Tanner these days. We're supposed to need a 5.6. U.A.M. Better than a man, or nearer. Jump in, the taxi car, but that driver, the drop-hunter. You look that mean, so quish-a-gling. I can tell he was in a dog. So I acted out my pop-shared and with my arms, the trees I made. No bug, speaks English, and a momma. I went down to my, yeah, I made a wish where the weather is nice. I'm so mean. I walked into a little bus call, but the guy there talks real fun. I asked him, what kind of fortune be-me just not to end up. What does that mean? The butt is too English, and I'm momma. That corner deline. Hell, I think I've been Pakistan's thick English mill. Are you been your back to the wall, alright? I can't hear. I can't hear. I can't hear the go-go. Learn my ABC. I don't say much as gross here. I said pretty pretty. So get yourself to a classroom quick, you're an American now. Stop making me sick. You know, but as fizz English, come on in here. That's pretty obvious. I'm looking at this many team plus, a radio mom B from a 4.0 time for 6 to 4.6 to our number 2 in the market. So you got CMQ FM, no speeding place. A radio mom B is second in the third in men, a team plus QM from our 4 to up to a 4.5. And why have the pages stopped coming across by the way? I don't know. I thought there was a jam on your eye. No, I was going to ask you about it. There's a jam on my end. I think you're pardon? There's no jam on my end. Maybe it's a tough thing about it. Pick it up from where it was. Boys and girls. I'm a refaxing from where they stopped. And yes, you want the persons 18 to 34. Absolutely not. Okay. On persons 25 to 54. What do we care about those? About 18 to 34. Why do we care about that? Just really interesting though. It's quite a hard cone. The allegations of the hero are inappropriately by the way last month. That in the morning now, let's see. Our morning guy is 3.3 in the, I was, when are book up to a 4.2 from 13th all the way up to 7th. How do you like that? I'm Joe. I'm in Jolimo and Gildi and whoever else in it. Okay. Let's see. Who's number one in the morning? WXDJ FM. What is that? Is that another one of those? No speaking English stations? I don't, I don't, I don't say yes. WXDJ went from tied for fifth to numeral uno in a morning in men with a 5.6. Radio Mombi. Oh my goodness from a 4.9 to a 5.3. This is exactly what it is. CMQ FM 6.4 out of a 5.3. I totally dropped it and I'd definitely not done that to the big phony January. I mean, those were varies. I mean, look at this. And WQBA is fourth in men in a morning and then WRTO. That's another one. I rode it. The top five stations in my, I'm in market in a, and men in a morning are all no speaking English. F-D-J. Radio Mombi. W-C-N-I-Q-A-L-F-M-A. Q-B-A. And Radio Hitmo. Then Z-4, 1-2-4-4. Now much of it rise there with no stern on the air two out of the 3 months. Now much of it increased their poly pretty weak, pretty lame. Man, that is pretty freaking weak. I thought you didn't facet me any attend to 3 numbers now. Now you're skipping over 10 to 3 in men though. What's that all about? It paused and numpping up again. Oh brother. This is Radio. Is it that bad the number? The anticipation. It's what? Wild anticipation. Well, it can't be all that great. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Okay. Well, don't, don't, don't wait. Oh, it's fine. Oh, we're fine. This is, I don't see the beast answering any of these calls either. Do they have you? No. I don't have the equipment in the bus. Really hate you. You don't have the equipment. All right. Between the ears is where you don't have the equipment. What the wild event is you that you hate them so much. Really sad. I just thought it would be a nice for the audience because I can't possibly do that and do all of this at the same time. And I'm, you know, stapling these together and doing my little handy work here. I'm trying anyway. Better idea. He can go downstairs in the lobby and we can invite people to come and talk to him in person. And he can take us to jail. We can go out on the street corner there. We can invite people to come and run his ass over sounds good to me. I don't see any midday here. You did for whatever reason. The last page of the morning drive. I think that got screwed up then. Let me re-facts the mid days. This is really very unfortunate that this I'm just thinking about. This is especially just a trend that they already find as ponders had best in there. Already looking like play in part cheesy. They go on to the shuffleboard court. Anything besides listening to this. It's only an insider radio thing. But when you see in a morning the top five state. And you know who's fault that is. Don't you know, is dust still in there? Yes. Which is over for more staples. They're just right. It's your good post personal buddy Tanner who lobbied the arbitron. Oh, we are getting up his spandic representation. I got it all on that book. Which is why if you'll notice not just in our market but the whole nation might in the last book. All through the roof like all of a sudden they're multiplying like rabbits. I'll do you how who he owes out there. Oh, they are. Some of us. I still don't have no midday. This is this is how we're going to do. This is no. Jesus. Well, how come I'm getting 25 to 54 first because you're behind it. I beg your pardon because it might be behind because of your big fat behind. All right. Let's see how Hank did here in the afternoon. Let's take a look at the hump or okay. Who's on once in a while. I don't even have that. This is this is an abortion is what this is like I like starting with number 17 in the afternoon. That's the kind of this is the kind of sloppy. We got the beast there who won't answer the freaking phone. We got between Duff and George and Clarence and the got to miss. Oh, they were hitting. Huh? It's the machine. Who's machine? Somebody's. And then you've got a machine. I got a clean machine. Mr. Mam machine is the premo is against. So anyway, in the morning we did nicely. In nighttime we went up a little bit with at Marlon's goose to the from the hockey. Anyway, the hockey's a death wish. I feel like I've just been left out and I got six am to midnight. Person's 25.54. What in God's name? Because I was already vaccine that we'd already fact-stall of the. Oh, man. Oh, bro. Oh, bro. The machine seized up. Your machine seized up. Bro, we're talking to you. You're on the machine as a piece of crap. Yeah. Who bought that machine? You? Oh, sorry. I'll get a better morning I come back. Alright, let's see what we got here. Monday through Friday, Persis 20, I have nothing that I have, you know, I just just asked them a second time. Oh, here we go. Oh, we went down in men. Look at that. We went up a position, but we went down in the number. All over, we're damn near. In fact, tend to two, we might be number one. You realize that? In fact, I guarantee we are. Oh, I know. We are. Man 18 plus WCMQ coming off of that bogus January when they. The 11 shares supposedly from a 9.0 in a winter down to with 6.5. Still number one, but hang it up by their fingernails. Thanks to that Guillermo Schwarzscher, they got on noon to two. We went from a 6.5 from number three up to a 6.3 number two. W, I O D went from a 6.8 down to 6.1. How do you like that? Radio, mom B went way up. So this is a heavy duty, uh, holy oboken. Of course, the 25, 54 numbers will give you some insight into something. If you, if you could see them, I have laid out here in front of me. It was an opportunity for a man of mine. Even, even, dotting old fool like me as well. This is sad. Look at this. I got, lug 94 is eight is 17th and men. Yeah, so my God. All right, let's get back to mid days here, okay? CMQ FM QAM I would do an audio, mom B life magic. Magic dropped a little bit. Looks like to me. Would you say that that's an accurate assessment? From what? From where they were in the wintertime. They dropped a little bit from the last time. I, what about the rest of the afternoon? Are we going to get the rest of the afternoon or not? You're getting everything now. I'm getting you. I'm getting hemorrhages. They're popping up like crazy is what I'm getting from this. All right, I'll tell you about. I'll take a couple of calls myself here since the beast is too much of a hot shot to do it. By the way, this is the beast last appearance on our show. It's been nice knowing you. W QAM Hello. Yeah, can I ask for a request? A request? And what would that be, sir? Kits and African American good morning. Can her work be with Sam? You want to hang up on him? What you want? What was he saying? Nothing. Did you dump whatever he said? Yeah. Oh well, I just did again. What was he talking about? Nothing. Okay. Ficing. I told you the beast ought to take these calls. But no. I did. No way for me to take a call. Why? Why? Why? Why would he just? No equipment. There's nothing to take a call with. Well, did that just happen today? Did the ear of the head said apparently? Somebody ran off with a headset. So if we wanted to put the calls on hold, if we wanted to have the beast talk to you, folks and take your in a crash. We can be from a whole. We can be from a whole. But. I said, forget about it. Thank God for that ball game. It's all I can say. Let's see how the Humper did in the afternoon here in men. Number one, baby. All right. Nice going fat man. Man 18 plus an afternoon QMX and same thing. Drop down in the share from number two a 5.3 and down to a 5.1. But up to number one in the standings. That's all we care about. We don't give a crap about to share when you're number one, right? Nope. When you move up a notch. WEDR 4.9. Number two, how are we afternoon for 5 up to a 4.7. CMQF and they're starting to drop that away. They belong in the middle of the pack. They're not full of anybody. WID, the Schmidt nice there. So I think that as you see bushes numbers drop and you're going to see that right wing crab drop and two. They're finally they're finally giving up some of them. The ones who aren't the absolute religion is the real true believers. The diddo heads. They're finally giving up on that crap and same well, you know, guess what? It turns out to be a polycrap. Maybe we've been lied to a little bit too much and we don't want to be that embarrassed or whatever. Maybe they just didn't get the virus more likely. And anyway, they've down from a 5, 7, to a 4, 3 from number one and they have to know in men to number six. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just trying to get organized here. Okay. Like why pile of mess that we got here. Then did you get all the many team plots or do we have to tax in that? Oh, I got them all right. I got all the men I can handle right now. Great. I don't have John Stockwell, but he's old and wrinkly now anyway. So who'd he'll give the crap? Persons 25 to 54 Monday through Friday. On the first sheet, you've passed me for just a second. They're I thought we were number one in Persons. I almost passed out. Moll, nice job. No number 17. I'm sorry, but from a 2.3 up to a 2.8. We're making some serious progress. Okay. Let me sort some of this crap out here in the last half hour. I think I might be what's going on. And then we got the Marlon ballgame coming up. In fact, we got Josh slap and Dave and growing around at the ballpark right now a little bit. Get some circulation going in those cheeks. Slyp, I'm on a face one time too, Josh. That might help. 1157 at 5.60 WCM. We apologize profusely for the mess that this half hour has been. This has been very sad. I'd all know it. Keep you on your toes. And me too.

Less than half our way. Thank God. Thank you God. Okay. Now let's take a look here at 6 to 10 a.m. Persons 25 to 54. Okay. This is men and women. Hot 105 is number one. 8384 about the same. WXDJ. You see, every time it seems like there's another book or another trend, some station comes out of nowhere inexplicably and makes this wild increase. You know, I'm talking about like wire diaries. I mean, wild increase inexplicably. Explicably. That's very well put. Right. WXDJ, which to be honest with you, if you put a gun to my head of your stock on Uzi up my rectum, I wouldn't be able to take it where that is on the dial. I have no idea what that is, what they play. Just like the CNQFM thing. They had a 4.4. They were number six in men in the morning back in a winter book. And now all of a sudden they've got a 5.4 share. They're number two. Their QM is just gone skyrocketing. They must be playing the CD accrues all day, isn't it? That's the one that's playing the CD accrues record, I think? No, we could do that. I actually have losing the damn dead now. But that renapping when I was alive. I really didn't do any more. I really didn't do any more. I really didn't do any more. Radio hitmo is number three. So again, here look at this. In the morning 2554, you got a black station number one. Hot 105. You got SDJ. No Spigiting Place. WRAMA. Radio Romanceas 4. WAMR. Radio Amoris 4. Time for 4th with RMA and AMR. I think they just can't tell the colors apart. WCMQFM is number six. Oh my god. And then power is number us. Time for six. Right. All ethnic stations, man. All the ethnic summer. Are there any like white non ethnic? No. I think you had the right idea this morning before the show. And what was that? Somebody's fault. I think they're ought to be elossed. Oh, Bill Triner. I think it sounds like a lawsuit to me, Greg. I think we all the whole state needs to assume this Tanner. She's the Tigrin wood pile. We're paying him. She's the one. He's supposed to be the consultant for all of our stations. Not just for our power, but for all of our stations. And yet he's running around open up a big YAP with Arbitron. Well, they're a Spanish stations are represented. They're under Sample. They're at Bologna, okay? If you would have believed in this Tanner, there's only like 18 people in a whole town who was speaking English. Why 100? What? You got a 43. There's six in the morning and whatever this is. Zeta. Three, five to a four. They made an increase there. How do you like that? They actually went up. See, I don't lie about the numbers here. Paul and old Ron. They did all the what did they do in men? Did we figure that out yet? Or do you over that big part? How did they do in men? Four, one to a four, four. A slight increase there, many team plus nothing spectacular. We'll see. But they did a nice increase there. And perces 25, 54, 35 up to a four point. Oh, with Howard Stern was okay. Oh, by the way, we have a headset update. Yes. I went and searched the studio and found where somebody had stashed it. And where was that? Oh, on the other side of the computer on the floor. Like somebody had just thrown it on. Like somebody shmicked can it? Somebody just threw it away from them. You know what I mean? And it went right behind the computer behind the camera. I was going by the way, definitely. And clearance, I'm keeping all these spaz holes out of our studios there tonight. Very nice job. So we read all these two's this time. See if if you would have said that right in the beginning and so saying, Oh, stop it. Do that. It's a bad idea. If you would have just said there's no headset. And I would have this fun. Oh, I still have that idea. It wasn't anywhere near it. It's not a bad idea. Why is it a bad idea? Would you subject anyone to talk to the callers? So another was it's okay for me to put people. I like that smuck that we had a dump before we didn't pay a lot of money to put them on the air. And what's he getting paid for to sit there on a spad ass in the food? No, right. Oh, well, now that clarifies a lot. Mid days. Let's see. How do we do 2554 men and women? Now we have no women. So all I do is like double the number. We went from a 4 3 to a 4 4 from 9 to 6 tied for 6. So we went up a little bit so the 8 8 we did about an 8 4 8 5 and men. Sure. That's pretty darn good. That's certainly a well enough number number one in them. 2554. That sounds like a bonus to me. Chacheng. Of course this is only one month. Only one month. Don't get too carried away now. Let's see Monday 2 Friday 3 to 7 in the afternoon. How did the a hump or do there? Humber. Where are you? 3 2 to 3 4 from number 16 to number 15. So you take the 3 4 in your double it is 6.8. So we got about a 6 5 going there. It should be enough for number 1. I think we're going to be number 1 in next 2554. We stopped the book right now. You got a horse that's three likes to head to the top of the stretch. When you're tripled, you got all three your horses are leading the pack at the top of the stretch. You're saying stop the race now. Stop the end of course they never do. No, don't stop now because if that CMQ trend continues. That's how crazy drop they made. Well what do you mean by that? We're going to pass them. Right. He's going to pass them like they're standing still. How did they do in midday? Now they mentioned that. CM4. We take a look at this as a significant story there. Oh yeah. 6 1 down to about 5 1 from second down to 4th and midday. Oh you're looking at the persons. Right. I was looking at the man. I don't know. But 2554. The men includes a lot of old men. Yeah. No, obviously there were a lot of old Julios who got that. He's in this. Well I mean there's no question. Yeah, but I know that. I think you'll mind that. That one I would nickers man. That one I would with the Chiquita banana. That one I would dizzy our knees. I'll let it crap. I'd rather you on more my ass and not you. Oh, oh she's. It's a miracle. Let's pen ourselves in a back big time. Okay. Yeah. Oh, sure. How do you do in the market where nobody speaks English and half of the ones who do speaking with pretend that they don't? How do you compete in the middle of that? Okay. What kind of a bunch of crap is that? And then you got a consultant that's running away. Arbitron company saying, Oh, you're under sampling my spix man. You're under say all the other garbage. Which you'll notice all across America. At least he's having some impact. He's having some cloud. That's screamer. He's having some of the 70560 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. What celebrity are you? Let's get back to the poll. Okay. Let's get back to the show. That was a 48 minute disaster. Or 30. Whatever. It'll see. Oh, it. Huh? They love it. What do they love it? It was in for a hearing. I still don't know what talent's all about. All I know is we must have a pretty decent month. Did the dumb up extrapolate any of this? Not yet. Well, I'll do it right now. I'll tell you where we had many team plus. What do we just have in here? Well, dude, we actually go down a little bit a little bit. A 10th of the point. Yeah, but I don't think the individual month was anything or right home about. Well, the hell did we have in there? Can I find it? Can you find it? We got a search party out here. We're looking for it from there. It is by the 6.3. Ah, 6.3. So that means the 9 18.9. And we had the, let's see, what do we have? 6.6 in the 6.1. I think. Some of that 12.7. So we had a 6.6.2 in April. Okay. Well, that's okay. Not great. Huh? That's 10 to 3. Now, the mad dog, he always holds his own. He's always throwing it in a good number. So we'll see. That's only one month. But it means time. Biggest falling off the face of the earth. And Ron and Paul, he picked up a little bit of the pieces there in a morning. Not spectacular. Nothing sensational. And he heard once again, sucks the big one. Okay. I mean, they're just outrageous. And Tom, Jacob, where are you, huh? You got a major FM there with 100,000 watts on the dial. It's been like a major player. Thanks to Stern. And now they're dropping off the face of the globe. We even beat him in the morning 12 plus no less. Is how bad they're dropping. And he can't be bothered right in the bottom. This is the kind of urinalism you get in South Florida. Man, you got two fish wrappers and it's really pathetic. That's why you'll be your ought to read our website. I get it back like I started to do the pull question. And it's a damn good thing that the beast didn't take anymore names. Seriously, you're right. I mean, we got how many names we got on there already. I'm good man. We really do. Yeah, 55. 55. I mean, that's plenty. 418 votes on there already. What celebrity are well known person as your all time? Sexual fantasy. And if yours is none, here start thinking about some of these. Maybe it'll do something for you. Ridney's beer up. Ridney's beer is 55. Howly, Barry 36. Rack Hell, Wells 23. Heather Lockleer, 21. Selma High, AK team. Anna Pornakova, 18. Angelina's your lead, 18. Johnny's depth 15. Phoebe Kates 15.

I'll say one thing. At least the beast can spell Barbara Eden 7. Jacqueline Smith 6. Until he got to that one. Catherine's native. 25. What? George give it that one. No. I think it's JACL YN and maybe I can't about out loud. Who cares? Rachel Wall award five. Jenna Jamison's got five. Jamie the Curtis has got five for them. We're like at the Diky. Elizabeth Hurley for Shirley's. They're on for she ought to be doing better than that. There ought to be a lot more people fantasizing about Shirley's. But that's the Williams 3. Beyond St. Louis 3. Serena Williams is got three. Sally's brother's tree. Marisa Tormay, Misspelled 3. No I. John Stockwell's got three now. How do you like that? Samantha Fox 2. Cindy Crawford and everybody else really teeny tiny taters. Marlins pregame at 12 30. I feel see this is not right. I feel like I've done about a 75 hour show today. This is how it's spelled right. It is. I checked. How come I I looked at it checked in myself. But it's one of those deals when you type in a Misspelled. It'll just to be friendly. It'll go along with you like no matter how you spell it. You could spell the THZX and it would still come up that way. You know. You're right. Bastards. Providence passed noon at five 60 WQM. Everybody in there brother now is trying to set you a hairpiece man. Absolutely. It's scary and that's because just about all of us when we're later faced that male pattern baldness. Now if you want the beast look, that's fine. You can walk around like a bowling ball hit all your life and of course, in this case does it really make a different? No. In my case does it make a difference? No. Absolutely not. But a lot of you guys see you got a chance to look at a lot better in younger than you ever thought you could.

Male service cut off in cross springs area after acid bombs found. Do you see this story? Yeah, all over the place those punks. The Generalites. Like I said. A series of five acid bombs placed outside four cross springs homes. Yesterday morning damaged tree curbside mailboxes. And one vehicle across mail service. Nearby temporarily suspended. No one was injured in the incident. The court decided to reach the court. Police spokesman. Postal inspector Debbie Allison said mail service was temporarily suspended. The area with the devices exploded. As police officers check mailboxes. The livers in the area resumed. Some areas like to the afternoon. The audio. Tuesday's discovery followed six other bombs being found across. Spring since May 24th and three mailboxes. Okay, to just down the street for one or two days. Bomb locations have been set on fire over the weekend. In the past, these usually been perpetrated by kids. Of course, we're going to be looking at it that way. The Corvo said, but it could be an adult. We don't have any suspects. In mind at this point. Ain't that lovely. All they got to have something to do up there in Corvo Springs. Carries Riverir Abit stop reinforces Florida's importance in the election. You see, uh, old Carry Meister. The Herman Munster was in Riverir Abit. I'll throw him on the TV. Cho as a scenic waterfront spot with Rose of Onion with the uniformed and unformed law enforcement officers behind them. To launch his latest attack on President Bush's National Security policies. He still looked like a dead man in the suit if he asked me. He received rousing applause from a crowd of 300. In account he there remained so riled over the 2000 election that a winch had seen obvious. You people in Palm Beach County better go out and drove in November in the thousands. Okay, you may get all your dead relatives to vote to get him registered right now. And those absentee ballots better come pouring in by the millions. But Carries speaks at the Port of Palm Beach mark his third visit in three months to Palm Beach County Assignities not taking votes are granted. And even they traditionally democratic strongholds of Eastern Florida that helped delay President Bush's win in 2000. Bush won the state in the presidency by only 537 votes with the Democratic Palm Beach County. Best known for creating the infamously confusing butterfly ballot showering much of the blame. Yeah, all you old Jews up there that voted for Pat Buchanan. Oh, shame on you as you was silly old Jews. Why? Because those silly old Jews made the Al Gore lose. And you don't like rat. You're spitting. I'm spitting a man. And maybe they ought to be going in toose to vote this time. Those silly old Jews. Better be news. Just cruise on off your vote and spot man. Anyway, I think in Palm Beach County it's not a question winning it or losing it. That rap crap man. Anybody that calls that music. And just like I was talking about yesterday about those nostalgia things I was watching on biography. Any while you name me a rap song. That's going to be remembered like 30 years from now. But 30 man. Just name me one. Or a rap artist. And don't give me no 50 cent. Huh? I'm talking about a live one for example. Wait a minute. I got it. Yeah. I don't think it would be it. And don't pick you up me that M&M crap. Okay, I'll let you like the M&M. Pretty good. I think in Palm Beach County it's not a question winning it or losing it. But what magnitude of it you they can achieve said David, and associate professor political science at FAU because the essence of the democratic masses. You can lose almost the entire state as long as you win a big enough margin of few of the counties. Like Dave and Broward and Monroe and Palm Beach. Niven said the late governor of Lawton Childs walking lot in the hecoon defeated Governor Jeff Bush in 94 by winning only a handful of Florida 67 counties. The populous counties of southeast and Florida could liberate similar victory for a carry this time. We can only pray. We can't afford to have a close enough so they can have those goons from out of state. All those paid goons come in knock at the doors down going. Let us in. Let us in. I'll let fake crap that went on there. And immediately just buying right into a man. All the media was obsessed with a show and us that judge was staring up at that whole of the Ovalet that's all that's the only thing they cared about. We must have seen him how many thousand times. Twenty thousand times and that was just in the first month after the election while I recount was going on. Before Clarence Token Thomas said, Oh, send it up here, baby. Send some good crap and send it on up here. We'll take care of it for you. And that and scolier said, Oh, sure. Okay. Yeah. We'll do it. So anyway, that's the deal. I think we'll see a lot of John Kerry and Palm Beach County said, Niven. I don't think we'll see a lot of George W. Bush because an unpopular political figure tends to increase turn out. And the more people that vote, the more you're going to lose that county by George W. Bush doesn't do himself any favors by showing up here in Palm Beach County said, How do you like that? So the Bush mice do ain't going to be showing up in much if at all. You know, we're he'll show up. He'll be showing up in telehassy. What is brother? He'll be showing up in two egg. Tampa. All the mugwon parts of the state. That's right. For all the tree climbers are hanging it out. We're all the abeasies are up there in the hangout in the tree and hanging by their limb. Anyway, we got the ball game coming up and I'm so delighted to be getting out of here today. You have no idea that like this is like your husband. I have an idea. And out of body experience and additional watch there wasn't all that much change anyway. It's so perfect at big. And we actually look at the, I think I threw away all the numbers. I kept up. Oh, no seriously. Did we look at what they didn't men in the morning? In 18 plus my moment please folks. Let me just fumble to this one more time and try to salvage something. Big 106 which were always number one by a mile when Stern was on. Big 106. Look at that. They already had dropped from first to fifth with a four six in the last book. And now they dropped from four six and number five to a three three and number 14. And it's still with that huge month of February in there. What's the next train comes out big 106. Well, basically, Spanish from the face of your radio. I don't like that. But they got Paul and O'Ran on there to bail him out. Think that's going to do it? No. No. A little bit, but not not much.
