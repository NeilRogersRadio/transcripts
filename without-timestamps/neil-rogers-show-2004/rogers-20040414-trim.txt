My heavy Ford's mother-jee. Here we got our new TV here, baby. Oh! There's George Tenidou said... This is your company. Uh... That's doggy. Hello! Hello! Hello! Tabimotova residence. Oh, who is this to me? No, this is the wife, Talia. Pracha! I like to speak with Tommy Mitoya. Hello! Tabimotova residence! Pracha! What are you saying? Girl! No, no, Talia! Talia! Talia! Let me talk to the devil. Please, hold on! Tommy! Tommy! Yeah! Tommy! What is it? You got the phone! Oh! Oh! Hello! Tommy Mitoya! Speaking, this is Michael Jackson. You lost your job! You lost your job! Oh, no! Hey, I didn't lose my job! I stepped down! Or sure, however you want to play the picture. Whatever you want to tell yourself in order to say some sort of face you'll do it, but you will lost your job! You know, actually it's kind of nice to hear your voice. What? Kind of nice to hear anybody's voice. If you're talking about... Yeah! Can you hear that? That's my Mexican wife! Let me tell you! It was cute for maybe five-pin minutes a day. But if I got to stay home on her every day, I'm going to go crazy. You're getting your justice, search, Tommy Mitoya, that devil. Oh, we do! Is it Mexican food? Chimichangas, burritos, toastitos! I got more gas than Exxon! And you deserve to have the bloat! Oh, listen, Michael. I'll reserve for somewhere. I'll start another label. Sure you will. So you can destroy the career of other budding artists. Oh, we going to Chevy? Yes, Tommy, we're going to Chevy. Thank you very much, Clara. Oh, geez. If it's not Chevy, it's it's chea cheese. If it's not chea cheese, it's what's that driving place? I don't know what you're talking about. I called to be right you. And all I'm getting is dribbled and chimichangas. Mmm! And minute, I was the reason you were forced to be fired. Right, I know, because I'm very, very, very devilish. Mmm! I want to live in a mess! I want to live in a mess! You're living in America! Alright, hey, look, Mikey, I got to go, okay? I got to take over the Taco Bell. Chevy! Okay, Chevy, you want to come with us? No, I don't want to be seen with you. You are the devil. So at this point, I am finding myself having some sympathy for you. Mmm! Alright, alright, alright, alright, I got to go there, Mikey. Let me tell you something. If I were to find right now, after neighborhood, would go up. Mmm! Oh, God! Don't do it! Don't fart, Tommy! It looks like life's as baby. 10, all 3 at 5, 60, WC, and there is no point there. We got a Taliya story today, and a Michael Jackson story. Oh, it's not to life. But look at those eventually. Here's the most important story of the day. And say, let her to the editor in a herald. Or should I give the death count first? I ain't. 83 US troops killed an Iraqi in April. Nobody cares. For American forces in Iraq, these are the deadliest days of the war. At least 83 US troops have been killed in action so far this month. But the most recent death announced yesterday. Also this month more than 560 been wounded and two soldiers declared missing. At least four American civilians were killed. One contractor was captured by gunmen, six others missing in fear of abducted. And our president, he last night says, ah, oh, we're fine. Alright, that's basically what he said. I didn't watch it. I saw about two minutes. I was enough. I can't take it. I guess, then, can I watch it? He just makes me gag. The number wounded so far in April exceeds the total for any other full month of the war by more than 220. Should every death sentence again? The number wounded so far in April exceeds the total for any other full month of the war. It's only the 15th by 220. But El Presidente says, oh, we're fine. It was worth it. It was worth it. It was worth it. We're going to have good months and bad months. I like that idea. What I had politics, religion, money, and golf. And professional victims like our mothers, both our mothers. Professional victims. Oh, my God. I thought she would never leave. Oh, it's got the crap. I know. She just, she drives me up the wall. Oh, I speak to my mother and your mother. Here's the letter. Judith Cohen, an adventurer, writes to the Miami Herald this morning. You'll love this. Listen, the heading is wrong word choice. Ah. Ray Leslie, a bravinel's April 9 column. New Yorkers have planned to bully you over. I was extremely disappointed. The choice of words to describe the people who may frequent the Ivy restaurant in Avintura. Oh, the term Yenta is derogatory and bigoted. The Yenta is who subscribed to the Herald frequent the restaurants and support upscale merchants, other ones, who make Miami a desirable place to visit. Why choose to offend asks Judith. Let me answer your question, Judith. Yenta. See, Yenta's not just an offensive word. It also was accurate. And not only that, but first of all, how many Yenta's are there really in Miami? Aventura ate Miami honey. But if you talk about South Florida, the Yenta's are one of the reasons that this place is so disgusting and despicable and obnoxious. Just like the Yenta's who were gathered at Pompeto Park last Saturday in the Alob either, screaming and hollering for their free programs. That's a Yenta. Okay. That's a quench. Oh, no, that's my mother. A professional victim. But at any rate. Is this perfect? Oh, me. Why choose to offend? In other words, the truth hurts Judith and Aventura. Okay, you can't handle it. It's obnoxious. It's disgusting. The behavior is subhuman. I wish I had her problem. Don't be a Yenta. Okay. Oh, I could be having like a coin in the barbarian times this year on. Okay. Here's the poor result from yesterday. I'll be for that. Patsy Kenset. I have no idea who she is. But she's behind to be the curtain. If you're over the age of 65, if you're not a Yenta, if you got 55 pieces of ID, if you got 45 grand parents who will vouch for you and you never freight train all of these things, then you can take a little quick peek. Keep your hands above the counter at all times because John asks cross eyes are following you. Oh, he said Clinton did it. He did. And then when they didn't believe that, he said the dog did it. But he's dead so we can't testify. He flew the planet. But he, uh, buddy done it. Maybe that's why the Lord's smoke. And he's smitten by the Lord. Don't forget he is risen, by the way. The Lord is risen. And just like a bad spun cake, he just fell right in again. Yeah, he keeps falling down. Somebody must have slammed the other. He's kind of like fat boy tries to rise in more. He just keeps falling down until he gets that nice cane. He's got. What a, what a tub. Patty Kensett. I mean, I'm fat. But I just, what did I call her Patty? Patty. So Patty, Patty. I was thinking of fat boy. Why would I want to say Patty? Patty Kensett is our lovely, whatever she is naked. Naked. Oh, no, let's not ask cross-five out about it. You have to be over the age of 75 to see it. So don't worry about it, John. She was born March 4, 1968, Hounslow London, England, and the UK, which makes her 30-6. If my math is correct, it is. Here's some of the films she was in, who's you daddy? Shelter Island, celebrity naked ambition. That was a TV made for TV. Darkness falling. One and only. Bad karma. Let's perfect for this town. Bad karma. Don't be a yenta. Loves music loves to dance. That was a made for TV movie. Things behind the sun. Aladdin, best worst. The pavilion. Janis Beard, 45 words per minute. Eh, I don't know what that is. It sounds a little strange to me. Made for TV, a human bomb. Oh, she's been in like, oh, brothers. Isn't it? Leitha weapon too. Their skipper. Chicago, Joe and a show girl. Does this mean we're married, Blue tornado. Blame it on a bellboy full of clips. Boy, the video collection. Better harvest. Fall from grace. Turn of the screw. A turn of the **** can't say that. No mole. Am I right? Absolutely. I'm listening. I'm responding with my close personal buddy this morning. The a moment. If I count my card's right, I can miss him next two mornings as well. Because the last thing I want to see early in the morning is him. Absolutely. God, what a thought. So do you think glue or tape? I'm thinking, no, he's not a snappy guy. So we don't have the snaps on the forehead like those other people do on rail. Now, they have a snap on piece. I'm thinking like Elmer's. Elmer's glue. They're thinking spirit gun. Spirit gun would be interesting. Maybe we can get somebody to spirit him away. I know Greg would be happy to see that. The Holy Spirit. Right. The Holy Spirit is the risen by the way. Ninety never had 71 votes on a poliest today. Which of these people are things? This is we're going to do this every day the same question with different categories. Which of these people are things you care about least? Almost 2,000 votes. 2,000 votes. 2,000 votes. 2,000 votes. 2,000 votes. How come I can still say that? It's not a word. What is a lot of things that aren't a word? I mean, it hearts not a word, it's hard sound. But anyway, the Pope wins 387. Silly old, cheeky man, who's like only a breath away from death. The Pope 387. Rush Limbaugh 334 who's only a breath away from another oxy. Kate Moss 320 is only a very thin breath away from a fell falling into the floor. Mirah, the mommy he 265, I'm delighted to see that because the NBS pure crap. It's not as much crap as golf. Because the right actually, some of the flutters has been involved not too much. Because you got 12 foot guys. Jan was slam a jam in an attend foot high basket, not too tough, you know. Game marriage to 16. Al Franken 1802 is just awful. Ralph Nader 148. He's the anti-Christ. Mindy Dolphins 94, because nobody down here unless you're a fan of the Patriots like some of us who have got better taste. Nobody don't love the fins. Mindy Dolphins 94 and the Warner Act 25. That's almost enough to, we needed 40 to counterbalance to a swap for the hostages. So we'll start with the first 25. Just line up at about 230 outside Melissa to have the bus waiting for you. But whatever you do when you get there to bag dead, don't be a yenta. I don't think it would probably be good. I do to be a yenta and bag dead right now. And in fact, I would change the head gear is what I would do. Sure. The more I see these stories, you see the story about the little girl that was of been picked on. Yeah. That was in Boyton Beach, I believe, that's some school up there. And she had the, what do they call that? Not the Berkha, but they have the, what are they called or head gear? Smata. Well, yeah. It has a real name. I don't know what it is. I know. And I'm thinking of myself, the whole world is, I keep making a joke about that. But we do that's what it boils down to. It's a battle of head gear. I head gear's better than your head gear. Yeah. And that's what it is. I got the yarmic and I got the Pope with a bini. I got the the Berkha, the Jerka, whatever whatever I got. Right. It's a battle of who's got that gear. And of course, we got the women behind the whole thing. You were certainly don't want to see those women. I believe you don't. Yeah. No, trust me. The ones I'm doing. You don't want to see him either. I don't want to see their feet anymore. No, change. You want to see nothing. In fact, I'm not sure they got what you are interested in seeing. 5, 6, 7. Okay. Here's the pull for today. What's it these people are things you care about least least. NASCAR. Thanks to our friend in South Carolina who facts and that's exist in yesterday and we got today. Which of the in fact, you might see you make suggestions for tomorrow. On the fact machine, not on the phone. We want important calls today about head gear and golf. Which of these people are things you care about least NASCAR, horse racing, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Israel, Donald Trump, Sports Talk, or Arnold Palmer.

You a-yeah. Nobody should talk to me at that way. How are you talking to me that way? I mean, how can you talk to me that way? I work here. I didn't come in here to be as creative. Not a much, please. That's what I, I, I, I, I can't let a work today. That's why I come in. I'll let you know. That's why I came in here. I thought lunch. I don't want to go to the line. Go to lunch, George. Where does he get off talk that way to a working man? Well, you take it outside. We have people trying to do business. That's what I came in here for. That's what I'm trying to do. I mean, I mean, I mean, to stop with that excuse me. I mean, to stop with that. I mean, to stop with that. That's not right. Cough. That's not as long as I do. You get out of here. Will you get out of here? Will you? I'm trying to run an office here. Now will you go to lunch? Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? When you really rather have a pizza, a pizza, a pizza, a 15-on-fuel. Now for 15-on-fuel. A pie with all the sauce of bars. I was really with rather have a Cuban dewy with all new Cuban engineering that converts a boat of a car into a boat, a ride on Sherlock Joriously in a real juvenile. With tailwinds high enough to sell your throths the lanes and into the sea. Has it inflows? When you really rather have a Cuban dewy. A Cuban dewy with a pizza, a 15-on-fuel. I'm trying to run an office here. A car that always was a thought. It's 10-17 at 5-16. I ordered from Bokeh. WQAM. Anyway, here's the face I can't figure it out. Marcello and Pemberg Pines, who are kisses my ass, which is fine. I really love an enjoyer. I never communicate with radio programs, but yours is the exception because it's the only sign left in our airway, but there's still hope for us in this crazy town and country. I have to say historical, puritanical junction. You see that sign when I was coming in off the turnpike. Right. Puritanical junction. Yeah. If I may respectfully suggest an idea for a poll, which I'm always wide open for polls. One of the things that I can't make this out, it's got to get some ink, man. Get some ink, man. Get some ink, Marcello. That the struck me is unbelievable when I moved to my amuse. The fact that I'm almost anybody can get their own street name. Any other city to world streets in and after national heroes, world renowned artists, philosophers, other intervals, like a president for example, and howly would they do have all those presidents name. Here in Miami, however, we have Jose Conceco Street, Emerson Fiddepaldi Street, Jorge Mosconosiblevard, Jorge Lestconosiblevard, Christina Serailegui. I don't know who that is. See, a pattern? The criteria here is different. Right. As long as it's a spick-lass name, then it's okay. Has to be a Cuban. Alex, but Picania. Alex Lungle Reagan. Alan Rangel Reagan, turnpike. It'll be a bitter and white thing. That's a state thing. No, no, no, no. There's a Ronald Reagan Avenue. Alex Pincous, I mean. You know this has to say in George yesterday, we really hit the jackpot. He didn't realize how big he hit the jackpot. Golf, we can't say, uh, a fool anymore. So I said, I'm about golf hole. And of course, there are 18 golf holes under the course. It's a sports. And I said, we can't say, Bags, come up, golf bag. Right. I can't play golf without a golf bag. So we got two new things. If we said a president say, golf bag or golf hole, I think we're actually going to both counts. No, I did not watch that stuff last night. I do want to repeat something else you said. It's morning, you're on a roll. And that is that this is just these 9, 11 hearings. They're a dog and pony show. That's all this crap is for the victims. For the victims, and of course, for the talking, they had never worked. Oh, yeah, they got to have something to put on there. Because quite frankly, if you listen to the interrogators, the question is, it's almost all political. And they make these long like Bob Kerry. I don't know why he just doesn't stand up and start, you know, pumping his fist in here. All they do is just making speeches. The question last about 10 seconds preceded by a three minute speech. Right. To show us how much they know and to give the country their opinions and their take. What's your take set of the Kerry? Or somebody should have told him that was Dr. Rice and Dr. Clark last week. That would have been nice. Well, Dr. Clark, he must, I'm only times did he say that. Bob, good. And he finally got, I was even rooting for her once. He said, I don't think I look like Richard Clark. And I was saying to myself, no, he's probably pretty pleased about it too, because oh, brother, is she ever me as? Anyway, thanks Marcelo. I don't know what to pull it. It says, I'm sure that many more are names. And brothers of the people as much as you know, maybe what does the, what's street name bothers, I think it's a bad idea. Thanks anyway, Marcelo, but it's a bad idea. Right? I don't understand the question. I don't really care about the names. I don't know, I don't either, but I think what he's trying to say is like, which name or who does the re-sweet night after them or so. Yeah. I don't get it. Like Apple's way. Who was he? Computer guy. Oh. Anyway, what do we got so far out here? Which of these people are things? Well, I just said that because you hate Bill Gates so bad. I don't know what it is, but I've been buying all this computer stuff. Yeah, we're not going to be happy because it's making Bill Gates money. I don't like why. About a new world. Well, they're a choice. I can't even get that nice Sony. Well, that Sony isn't him. Sony a flat screen monitor. 19 inch. He gets a cut every day. I don't got a great new brother, a fax, a scanner, copy, or just like the one I haven't teoned. Oh, no less. Because I, you know, actually, all by myself, nobody ever taught me any of this stuff. Not that I'm such a genius. And I didn't need to call a friend last night for a couple of little pointers to finish up, but installation with a printer just make sure I hit everything right. But I'm like, learn in myself, and this. I, that may be the best way to learn the computer stuff. Right. Well, it's easier now that it used to be. Right. Even more on like I can do it. Right. Well, not all more on. I'm listening. Okay, just calm down. A good close. My main man. My main man. My new main man. I see, is he pathetic or what? I don't realize how pathetic he is as much when I'm by long distance, you know? Right. But even though I haven't really bonded with him in these three days, I've been back. I just just being in the same building. Maybe I can smell that piece that you listen on the way in. When you're coming in. Oh, sure. This morning, he said he was promoting using my Joe Rose show next. And then the man who has been the, the biggest ball bust there for the last 30 years in town, he'll Rogers must have been watching you. The biggest ball buster. I thought that was kind of a nice. I think he's still trying his own desperate way. He's reaching out. Well, he knows that ain't going to happen with Joe Rose, you know? Howard from Boca? No, it just ain't going to happen. In fact, Joe was ripping him and asking in today. Bad. That's going Joe. Always like Joe Rose. And mad dog. I mean, even though it's he, man that you won't say it because he can't because they have to work together on those games. And the dolphin broadcast. That's the centerpiece of man to his professional life. You know, he talking about his construction business. I'm not talking about financially, but I'm just saying that. I don't even have to ask him. That's where it's at. The jewel in his credit. Right. So that's he, he will even make the ultimate sacrifice. And he's working with a man he despises like poison. So he kind of like a down plays at the soft pedals it. Hank, of course, began to shadow about. I think the hopper despises him were the night. Which I never thought was possible. So he's reaching out desperately. Did that the last time was here when we had that sit down. Confed on the bench outside in the, you know, in a parking lot. Right. It was touching. And that lasted one day until I came to my senses. Cause I kept thinking of myself. And then he spoiled it himself when he came in and started ripping the rag and on the beast again. I see when you get to be that agent you start carrying that much about the little people around you. What is the beast? I mean he's annoying and he's incompetent on the ear and he's a yenta. Oh, I'm sorry Judith. But, uh, seriously, but why would you care about him? I do it. Right. Exactly. He's like a fly and just the brush it off. Not really. Oh, he's just a few things. I'm going to be friends with him about. Oh, come on. After all the stuff this old man is pulled. All behind the lens. All behind the scenes in his place. That's the thing on the ear. Oh, I'm just a wonderful guy. And I'm a great play by playman. And I'm the expert on this on this. Whatever. But behind the scenes the most cherished, the most obnoxious, the most disgusting, the most unacceptable. And I guarantee you that there isn't anybody in this building. Anybody who wouldn't kiss the ground if they could find some amazing way just to make him disappear. I'm listening. I'm just making him go into this. Just to find a bucket of money. Oh, look at this. Here's the money to pay off. I'm all Howard David and bye. Have a great life. You know that. Yeah. I do. I'm going to. Which is why Greg keeps feeding very jacks and all those lines about well, if we could just find a way to put Howard's third in a morning. And of course, every time, over here's that he's like probably hyperventilating. Right. Because, uh, I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I mean, how could you put Howard's third on there? I'm working here. Yeah. And that's your reason he doesn't. Anyway, well, how did I get off on that 10? He doesn't take me much to get to go on him because he just he's just a creep. He really is. And my point being, more you've just, you've just done too many vicious nasty, hateful, destructive things. And most of them failed, by the way. I mean, he did get Carolyn off at that show. But of course, he's got the inside in this place. So she's over to down the hall of power. He got beast off that show. But he's got the inside with clearance. So you'll never see him dump it out here. He got Zach off the show. Which means Zach can do his other job and, uh, hang around with all the hookers. Strippers at night. And, uh, you know, it kind of sleep a little, uh, extra late. So I, and I will say this, you know, well, what's his name, uh, shy? Shai. He's a reproducer that he had brought down from his, uh, pyzons up in New York. He seems like a pretty good guy. I was, he was sitting in the bullpen. They're this morning. I thought, and I met him yesterday. And I thought to myself, how does a guy who's like seems like normal? I mean, I could understand like Scott Junior or one of those people. Like, you know, what he, I did this guy. But how can this guy possibly, uh, it's just going to be a matter of time. Is that, yes. And, yes. For that already happening? No, nothing like that. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, if something were to happen, we wouldn't know about it because Shai, the kind of guy, he's a little shy to fly. He's a little drum-shai. Right. He'll, uh, he'll keep it to himself and keep the job. I'm going to tell him to start the festering. He'll start boiling over. It's like, yeah. Yeah. The point, critical mass. Uh, and then, of course, there's Galilee who, uh, has a lot of fun, but I'm just going to tell the ex behind the most back to me and everybody else. Maybe with a couple of drinks, let's take him up for beer. Who killed that? I hear Galilee's little shy, too. And if you had a voice like that, you probably would be as well. Anyway, well, look at that polls, got some votes on there already. Which of these people are things you care about, least, the least. NASCAR 38, Joe Costello would be upset about that. Any updates on Joe Costello? Oh, I'm sorry. No. Hey, call me Joe. But he hasn't heard of word from them. He's just just being just posturing for the public. Just like this dog and pony show with these 9-11 hearings. You know, like you said, it's for the families of 9-11 victims to pacify them. But it's not going to accomplish anything. They're going to find anything out. It's just, it's just the blame game. That's all. Well, you did this and Bush did that and tended to this and the FBR and Competit, well, that's, we all know that already. Right. You know, so what are we going to do about it? That's the obvious question. What are we doing as opposed to having all of these geniuses sitting there and showing us this, participating in how Bob Kerry knows this and Richard Benveniste knows that. And Jim Thompson's a Bush, you know, sick of that. NASCAR 39 Donald Trump, you know, say, didn't say liquor because I can't say those things together anymore. NASCAR 39 Donald Trump 25 is real 18. If you do go as real don't be a yenta and don't be a sitting target. It means multiple. Arnold B. Arnold Palmer 16 sports talk 10 horse racing 9, Fox News 6 MSNBC 2-1-1-1-per-cNN. CNN's on right now.

They're actually our people who are building talking about the fan, 1400 about that other sports station at the we referenced yesterday. Of course, which makes me wonder what in God's name is wrong with these people. Didn't they do that the first time with the other people? But that station had some people I mean, you know, they may be a little teeny tiny book on a Witton scale I was about it. But this station first of all you can't hear it anywhere that's number one. And number two, Carl Foster, I'd rather have bananas foster, okay? Any day of the week. I mean, nobody knows who, and there won't be anybody on that station, anybody knows who from, oh, they are. Plus nobody can hear it. But I'll not do that. They're going to do great. Sports. I said, oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. Religion, golf, politics, money. What's not to like? We can't talk about sex anymore. We can't have any. So now we're left to that. So sports is right in there. You got it. Glad that clearance got you brainwasse efficiently. 167 votes, which of these people are things you care about least. NASCAR 51 Donald Trump 32, we'll get change in. So a book of rangam you inspired me for yesterday about era America. Okay. She's been listening online. All right. Since they got only four stations, but at any rate. And I've been reading great things about the goddess about Randy. She didn't Reveuse. Good. A gugogurl and one of the reasons being that she's a broadcast. I know that sounds silly on my part. What a concept. A radio person on the radio. Oh, no. Yeah. And Brian was told me that it sounds like a bunch of kids sitting in room. They have no boardops. They have no technicians. I mean, it's a technical disaster. You know, just some people who wanted to like, you know, put across political opinions. And all of a sudden, they're broadcasters. It's pathetic. You know, it's just like taking somebody that's been hanging around the locker room in Soul Life. And all of a sudden, you're a talk show host like, I heard from Boca. Yeah. There's a good example. Happens all the time. Right. Poof your broadcaster. In fact, I'll give even a better example. That part of the job accuracy is Coach Salus de Colette that really frost my old ass, which is one of the reasons that nobody can. What's what's happening with this thing? Did I kill this thing? Uh oh. Wait a minute. One moment, please. But I sure hope this thing go down here. And I got it. Just relax. Like, uh, Merit, Merit, Merit, Merit, Merit. Yeah. My late little dog, my menpin, Restin piece. He could have been a bit of broadcaster than the crow. I mean, you've got to be shmentin' me the crow. And then we got that little element out there order. That's a racial thing. You people need more black talk show host out there right. Like Jim Verri, he went over big on the fan. He was really, if they were out there. If they were available, if they were articulate, if they could speak the language, if they could get gerade an audience, they'd be on, I guarantee you that. They'll kiss your ass for like us five or six year in man. For a seven or eight year, like some of the rest of us got. Well, I can't tell you what they'll do after the finisher with that. Thanks by the way, Clarence. Good job. What are you laughing about? Oh no, that's all the stuff I got here. You think you have more people? Yes, he in, muffle, boat.

I believe we all have the right to express our views After all the right to speak for you is a basic tenant is that a George tenet of art ofocracy However, I believe that the FCC legislative bodies and media entities have the responsibility to ensure that an appropriate Balance is made between the right to free speech and decent standards for broadcasting content over the publicly own air wave As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over the FCC I'll be participating in hearings on this subject. I'll continue to monitor the debate in the progression of related legislation I will keep your views in mind your communications important. It will enable me to serve you better in the Senate Sincilly bill Nelson. Well, that's not a bad response. You know it's a formula. It's not bad.

You got to sense the humor or learn brinstone so I'd be bombarded since he of course is On his Senate Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over the FCC over these word police Nazis that we got now who just keep making it up and expanding and expanding see This is what a lot of you people don't understand It started once upon a time. What's ahead? No business in doing it in fact. I got a right story here if I quit Babylon I'll get to later on eventually. Oh, yeah Bob bachelor is the FCC working hand in government Republican party good story But back in the FCC acted 1934 they were a regulatory agency to regulate the technical aspects of broadcasting period There was nothing in the FCC act of Congress of 34 that gave them the authority to like start being the word police Then a few radicals like Jesse Holmes radical right wing lunatics and then this idiot out there in a Kansas Sam Brown back and a few others They just keep egging them on and imploring them. Oh, you got to pass more laws and pass more bills So that we can clamp down to get all this forth and discussing crap off here so we can censor anybody We don't like we said that's what it really is all about And so they just they make it up as they go along first it was George Carlin seven words Then it was they think within decency sexual activity expatory or is now we got a new list of words now we got fart sounds Now we got this and we got that and you can and we got any million reasons why you can't entertain anybody Or have a sense of humor or do anything anymore so forget double on tundra I've double on time and triple on time.

But I'm going to sit there with my new brother, uh, facts copy or prettier. It's a nice number. Yeah. No, seriously. It's the brother MF, oh, we can say M. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Back up. 4800. That is one fine machine. About 275 bucks. Yeah. Black and white, but you know, who would I want some color printer? What? Cool. It's cool. Now back in the day before they invented those. WQAM. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. What's the poll again? Because I just tuned in. What do you mean what's the poll again? I don't understand. Something about who doesn't like people or something. Yeah, who doesn't like colors like this? All of us. We don't like colors like that. Okay. We don't like people like Connor. What's the poll? Go to your computer, okay? I'll tell you. Or listen to the show. See, you know what frustrates them is that this all this week. Now that I told them I'm making my own list. Oh, yeah. Yes, they were trying to do additions to it. It would be like, which was your favorite present? And we list all of them. And then they tried to add other ones on. You know, like we had them all on there. About rock fell. Yeah. What about Bill Gates? What about V Gates? Which of these people or things you'd care about? At least that's our poll. Okay, pal. That's our poll. Get with it. NASCAR 165. Trump 120. Horse racing 61. Israel 56. Arnold Palmer also Q 56. C.K.L.W. Mark and Tom. Sports talk 43.7. 7.7%. Carol East. They don't want to hear all these scores. And they certainly don't want to hear the big. Oh, I mean, he may be the nicest kind of world. I don't know very well. But the approach that he takes to the whole thing is so humorless. So deadpan. So deathly serious. And I really think he believes that. That's what scares me. You don't better than I do. Yeah. And if I were wrong. Nope. Well, that's scary. How can anybody, how can anybody that's lived more than a week? Take all of that cockarise? So seriously, man. He's just, I don't know. He's like, oh, and the big news from Puerto Rico. I mean, he just approaches it would like the fact that every pitch, every scratch at a cross, every, every part of every game is so freaking. It's so freaking important, man. He's passionate. Oh, really? Sports talk to, I said, you know, better night. It was sports talk 43, Fox News 42, MSNBC 6, and CNN still got only four out of 553. So if you do the inversion layer, then you turn them upside down. They, they were glued to, which is sad. But then again, they don't get the BBC, even the CBC A. So that's what they have to count on for news is that sugar coated propaganda with that simple idiot that the solid, ethyl Brian. I'll tell you, I'm starting actually like a little bit. Got Judy Woodruff, Jack Capretty. Okay. Yeah, on occasion. He has some lucid moments, you know. He's like me, he's getting along in the tooth. But he has some lucid moments where he's really, he really kicks ass. I mean, he's, he really ripped the crap out of Bush's so-called press conference last night. Good. You go, Jack. He ripped him an ass. I was like, I like it a lot. He said, well, he tells. He said, the same stuff. He's been saying, and he's a speech is all right. He's always nothing new in there. Why didn't answer the questions? He was, I couldn't believe it because he doesn't know any answers. I mean, this is on the certainly not news network, which are the AOL time order people are getting fine by the SEC because that $400 million of revenue that turned out to be bogus. But, you know, what's 400 million? Yeah, right. Queen friends, what was it 400 billion? Well, I don't know what it was. They probably don't either. It's kind of like the Parmalod people in Italy. Yeah, so, 14 billion to support. No, well, I'm sorry, was 17. I was 18 billion. Well, what's 18 billion Italy? Right. When you talk about it, there's a number of scones got that much in small change. That was a mattress. And by the way, we got to go to the mattresses now. What does that mean? What? Going to the mattresses. You don't know what that means? No, but more to it come from. It came from in a mafia when there were wars between the families. Yeah. They had places like an old factories and places where they had all these mattresses. And all the mobsters would hang out there and they would sleep there and they would live there. And they would find the hide from the other families. Go to the mattresses. You didn't know that? No, I didn't know that. I can't believe I knew something you didn't. That's a mirror coming about that anyway. I know a lot of things. That's what you want to know them. That's exciting. Yeah. Come on, man. You're saying it right swear. Can't swear anymore. I'm a shoulder, my grandchildren. And I will not be able to break the peace from me here today. I'm a shoulder.

But they forget their line and they just leave it in there because it works fine. It's always great when you go like in the film. When you go to the godfather and I mean back in the day. And there are people talking out loud because the one, the one, not you can make kind of movies that the dialogue is very hard to hear and understand at time. At times. At times. I talk. Right.

Because now I'm going to the Fritter's skull. I'm going to the rear room from... So is this a maribob. No Michael Jackson. Here I go. The blue suit is what I'll do. How will I keep this? With that land journey. Oh, that's the sheet. Ritor's skull is back. Here, girl. I have no life. I have another bomb. I have a shirt and a hotel and a bag. I'm not going to make any long trips to the shirt and a bag. Last week, they were shot and they didn't do well. They just did it again. I'm not getting too much information. We're not getting anything from your favorite news. They were seeing in. They were oblivious. They're putting out a bunch of old crap. It's what they're doing. Oh, no. Jaff is in circle for a possible move on. Al Sardar. You know, mo- mo- mo- Taba? What about how his name is? Oh, and of course, if we're actually going to get it because he goes into these mostly, surrounds himself with thousands of his supporters. Right. Right. So it creates a little bit of a logistical problem for us. Well, no innocent bystanders will be there. So if we're going to get him, we're going to have to do is kill some people. Right. And it's not what we've been doing over there. Kill some people. Right. R is there. Is one over here if you're over there. Thought a pain in the answer is in bystanders. Right. We'll be more than scared away. Oh, look at this. Here's somebody sent me a couple of blank pages on the facts that's good. Very good job from on hold productions. Oh, here's here is the link. I don't understand why he sent three pages to send me. Oh, Charles and your field beats. You're slipping, Charlie. He's under a lot of pressure. Not that I'm back in town for a while. He says, here's the link that will take you directly to the original script of the Godfather. I got it simply by bringing up Google and typing in Godfather script. You can find this script for many major motion pictures this way. I don't want that, Charlie. Thanks anyway. I'd rather watch the movie over and over and over again to get the inflection right. Right, exactly. Reading it off a page. Don't do it. You've got to hear. Daddy Fontay will never get that over. I don't get how many. Take over. Get any what? Great. Come on.

Mark another date. Because you've got another three months. And then they will decide again. Maybe another three months after that. We didn't say this year. Right. Good planning. That's going W and all your neocon chicken hawks. 595 votes. We're doing fairly well considering considering that we're I don't understand one thing. Yes. Yesterday. Well, when Voker came in he said, but this is like a ghost town. There's nobody here here in the building. Right. Well, both. And this morning I came in here. It was like I'm not coming fairly early. But geez. It's like, well, I thought the holiday thing was all over with. They've been having these meetings around here. I mean, I was worried about why. I don't know. I'm not included. Who's having the meetings? Well, I've just came out of one. Let's ask him. I don't think we want to hear about what that was all about. Not on the year. Which of these people or things can you care about least? 595 votes? NASCAR 180. Donald Trump 126. Horse racing 66. Israel 61 Arnold Palmer 59. Samuel Coot. Golf hole. Fox News 51 sports talk 48 7.9% almost 8%. How do you like that clearance? And by the way, get off those horrible things off the year. Those regions they're doing on the sports shows. Those attempt people attempts at comedy. Man, that stuff is cock on man. It's horrendous. It's awful. MSNBC 6 and CNN still got only 4 out of 601 votes. They trust MSN CNN. Even OCN right now, Scott. Of course, we'd like to see other countries. That bitch on here from the Pentagon. They even know that the shirt and hotel got hit again. I don't have time to do this before to break. Don't let me forget this article about the FCC. Right. The public ends in ball of stuff that's going on. Nothing's going to change anything. Also, panel says, Bursa repeated warnings. I got time for that. And Brittany. Brittany may get a wrong reality TV show. Nicky. Well, maybe not well. Back in the day, she might only make it. I didn't know. No, no, no.

Brittany's spirit's naked in Pompano Park in our hot to try celebration this weekend. Wouldn't it be something? See it. I'm going to go ahead. Brittany is. So, sister's brother's rose. Joe and Pete. But at any rate. It's the best we can do on a low budget. 560. Here's the ideal. By the time a CIA briefer gave President Bush the August 2001 presence. Daily brief. The PDB. Headline. Been allowed in the term of the strike in the US. The president had seen a stream of alarming reports alarming reports on al-Qaeda's intention, so says this morning's Washington Post. So, advice President Cheney and Bush's top national security team according to newly declassified information, released yesterday by the Commission investigating 9.11. In April and May of 2001, for example, the intelligence community headlined some of these reports been lawden planning multiple operations. Been lawden networks plans advancing and been lawden threats are real. The intelligence included reports of a hostage plot against Americans. It noted that operatives might choose the hijack in aircraft or stormy US embassy. Without knowing when or how the terrorist would strike, the CIA consistently described the upcoming attacks as occurring on a catastrophic level indicating that it would cause the world to be in turmoil, according to one of two staff reports released by the panelists today. And that bitch, Condoleezza, goes on and says, well, you know what I mean? We knew Al-Qaeda was bad, they were evil to us, but we didn't have the exact time placed in date. They didn't set a telegram saying, hey, be waiting for us over here on the street corner. Like those geniuses that were shooting up the cars, you know? Now, hold in my hand, my hand, my shorts. Reports similar to these were made available to President Bush in the morning meetings with George Tenith commission staff said, The information offers the most detailed account of today of the warnings the intelligence community gave top Bush administration officials, and it provides the context in which the CIA briefer put together a memo on Osama, Yama, and the logistics briefer Bush. So if the Clinton people wouldn't have had to be tied up with Monica and a blue dress in the stains in all that crap for like two or three years, and a $70 million they wasted on that, and if the Bush people wouldn't have been so intent on worrying about when we got to be able to invade Iraq, what excuse are we going to use, et cetera. And of course, the drug, the war on drugs, and the war on porn, and all these other real evil things in the country. Words and war naked statues and the word police, all of these things, maybe then maybe something might have been done. And when the FBI's got two of the guys addresses and phone numbers, phone numbers, they're going to give them a call. Well, what did you planning these terrorist attacks? Thank you. Yeah. Oh, that's right. I forgot. We had a couple of interpreters, but they were facts. So they got a fight. Yeah. We had to get rid of them. Err, it's speaking fake. Yeah. Thrat, smoth their heads. 10 past noon at 5.60. WQAM. Bush, Mr. Terny General, Governor, thanks very much for joining us. Well, my God, the things he's the former governor of Pennsylvania. Yeah, we know. He's boring as you are, Wolf. Hey, if you're going to do that in job like Wolf Blitzkrieg. Oh, he's good. He's man. Whatever they're paying him, it's too much. You know what I mean?

Viewers of Fox News are the most misinformed and national survey reported October 2nd. October 2nd, this is from 11.103. If you're going to fast me stuff, at least have it sometime in my lifetime.

Where members practice serpent handling. They wrestle with him snakes. Back in there, I could say something about that, but I can't know anymore. Parsons says long was holding a rattlesnake during an Easter service when the snake bit him on the back of a finger. He says the congregation prayed for the minister, but no one, including long sought medical treatment. The sheriff says he doubts any charges will be far because his words it's their belief. Why don't they take a day charge the snake? They also drink strict night. Do they really? Yes, they do. What? Talk to how God will not let them die. Oh, all right.

Restressants apply rates. something to change monthly 4.21 APR Each week about 40 million households tune in to CSI Cramcy Investigation, featuring the cerebral guild grism, or CSI Miami with a compassionate heracial cane, the success of the franchises both of the CBS fortunes for several years, a CSI New York is even in a works. In addition to familiarizing the public with various lab test chemicals and other tricks of the Cramcy Intrade, viewers also get a realist to compete with an actman of various violent crimes, a kind of inside the body of view of death. A recent show, for example, depicted a bullet rattling around a victim of skull, then lodging in her ear with accompanying sound effects. Is this in decent programming? Depending on the view as squeamish level, a reasonable argument can be made that these scenes are more in decent than either Janet Jackson's breast, or remarks made by radio personality Howard Spurham. Should Congress the FCC the Bush administration and various pro censorship advocate groups target CBS and its top rated shows? Since Jackson's ill-fated Super Bowl halftime wardrobe malfunction, the nation jumped on the indecency bandwagon perhaps like no time in its history. Suddenly the laws that have been placed for years are being revamped and finds increased geometrically. In the first three months of 2004, the FCC leveled in decency finds totally more than a million dollars according to the Center for Public Integrity, this amount exceeds the previous nine years combined. Finds and not only becoming more frequent are getting costlier, rather than hand out one fine, regulators are penalizing each utterance of deemed illegal. A recent published report in Trade Magazine broadcasting in cable reveals that the FCC is going to find an infinity broadcasting more than a hundred thousand for a stern broadcast. This round of finds will add to the nearly two million already paid by infinity for stern show since 1995. And to the upheaval the House voted 3901 to 22 in favor of the broadcast decency enforcement act, which increases the maximum find the FCC can end out from $27,500 to a half a million dollars. More importantly, the new legislation enables the regulatory body to find and retains directly, not just the companies they work for as court guidelines stipulate, the Senate has yet to vote on this bill. It's not much of a stretch to see the political motivation behind this movement, and general terms the kind of people of support restrictions against the decent programming. Our voters George W. Bush is seeking, while those who don't want limit free speech are usually in democratic challenger John Kerry's camp. For a bigger picture perspective though, these changes lay this down a slippery path. The issue at hand is adding to attempting to adequately define an decency profanity of sending other terms used to label art and expression. The FCC's in decency for example hinges primarily on sex, decrying language or material that in context depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as measured by the problem is that the FCC has developed its own universal definitions for these terms, but they fly an opposition to the idea free speech with Zative 5 which is a defining American trait. People simply do not want a governing body or anyone really telling them what they can or cannot watch, listen to a read. Established by the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC regulates interstate and international radio television, wire satellite and cable communications, however during the great depression and had a simpler charter to ensure that radio that is latest technological innovation serve the public by broadcasting valuable government information like weather reports and educational programming. Oh, here's the weather. The scope of the FCC seemed clear but a closeness charter related to the notion of public interest gave the regulatory body almost a limited power in exercising this power the FCC concentrated on fraud and enforcing standards of decency. The star reaching powers backed by federal appeal score in 1975 which declared Congress has made the FCC the guardian of that public interest. Despite the government decision social norms change and performance such as comedian George Carlin fought back, his indecency case went before the Supreme Court 1978 the Supreme Court ruled against Carlin effectively banning the seven swear words from being broadcast during hours when children could hear them. The challenge in today's battle is that supposedly non-political enforcement of FCC regulations sniffs of a political agenda. FCC chairman Michael Powell is particularly suspect considering that he sent a secretary of state colon Powell, the bipartisan commission appears to be waging a political witch hunt which has both sides of the dispute in an upper or critics contend that a bit of panoring the conservatives especially in the name of saving children from indecency helps the current administration in its re-election efforts. As soon as the reports surface about possible fines against steering he told his audience that the battle was political since he'd recently started public criticizing Bush. In a tight election vote the radio person now is approximately even in listeners could have consequences if properly mobilized. Ironically for all the bluster coming from the FCC the regulatory body really has very little power over what people view its jurisdiction is limited to broadcast television and radio stations. Yes the FCC may succeed me moving steering from the air waves but can do little or nothing about cable TV satellite radio the internet other forms of media outside of its boundaries so far. So where does Janet Jackson's breast fit into this mess? Like the Lucco crystal violet grissam and cane used to detect trace amounts of blood at the CSI crime scene Jackson's ridiculous plea for attention serves as an assalamant giving today's puritanical crusaders reason to go after people in ideas they don't like. Think of what you can see her latest seat is think of that when you see her latest ed on the shelf when you walk into the election booth in November. What do you say? One of the parts that I like is about the FCC wasn't created for that in 1934. It was so everyone could have a place on the year. Right.

Is broadcast television ready for Britney Spears? No. Representatives for the pop princess are shopping a reality series featuring backstage footage of her life on tour. Now, we're sure it's how not going to have to see what that little tour parway. Bye, bye, bye. Or that redneck from Louisiana that she supposedly was married to for about ten minutes. Being pitched with a pun style title on tourage. Or neckhute on tourage. I get it. I get it. The series would follow the lives of the Spears and her fellow dances on the upcoming European leg of the onix hotel tour for steamy concert series. Oh, I think you can forget about this. On tourage is being described as a cross between MTV's The Real World and 1991's Madonna, Truth or Dare. Spears would I don't remember that, do you? Yes. And well, what the truth or dare movie? Yeah, bad. But what a surprise. Spears would narrate even wheel the digital camera. Oh, I can't even imagine where she'd put that. The chronicle her adventures with her dancers, body guards and managers from the tour bus to the stage to the toilet to the bedroom to you name it. Get a 98-year easy. Even Michael Paube, watch an ad. It's a good thing he said him that towel. The six week shoot, excuse me, the six week shoot would produce six episodes that Spears team would hope to have on a year as early as the summer presumably providing a boon to the already healthy ticket revenue. She's generating. Spears speak at a boon, I think, or more likely to get a reality series featuring Pat boon and Britney Spears. Speaking of boon, or maybe Debbie boon. No word on whether any of the particular networks host a deal, but the front running network will have to act fast. Spears European tour kicks off in London April 27. Another potential hitch.

If it was like maybe 10%, you'd say, hey, he's got a chance. Maybe if we like try to get along with the better. If we go along with his new Cold War or hot war, but you know, this they are going to be a great event. But it's just too small of a part, too small of a, you know, peace, peace. Give peace a chance. What are you saying? Absolutely. WCWM, hello. Yes, sir. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I know I do who that is he mentioned it he just said that you're back in town and he got a Tom vows… I didn't get to hear how to go, but Tom vows you're talking and we're talking and now you come down, you're, you're Tom Fox again. Well, what does that mean? Well, like, you know, you come down and you va Vielen people, but you don't, you're not like a player in the high and you come down from Trona, he said it's not like its really the top from a couple hende miles away. He mean like 1,200 miles away. What what, what decisions you make where you're sitting when attach. What kind of grandpa's act? I don't know this. I don't know this can't know as you or whatever. I never heard of him in my life. Have a great day, Pally. It's really easy to talk from a lot. Talk about what? What you talking about? Talk about how their station blows. I guess he's just looking for a little publicity attention over there because now that Stern is off big one. Oh, six. You saw that first week in the train. Yeah. You wait till the 20 out to this month, which is now only, uh, let's see. Two weeks from tomorrow. Buckets of tears in the sales. You talk about desperation, man. And there are numbers. You can't complain about the numbers. They're going to have because they're not going to have any resumes everywhere. Right. In fact, they're changing the logo now to not so big. 106. Yeah. They're going to say, hey, remember back in the day when we had audience? Dude. Dog. Remember their numbers before? Pre-howered. Right. Now the big. Oh. And now after Howard. Oh. Right. I mean, the drop that they miss seriously in just one week out of 12 weeks in the train, that is shocking. So it's going to be precipitous because it's going to include an entire month minus during the morning. Yeah. And I mean, I like the guess who when I like a step in Wolf, you know, what, uh, an up is enough already. You know, I'm saying, first the crap that they're playing over over and over. They're like a magic one or two points seven on acid. 5 670 560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line QAM. Hello. Yes, sir. How are you doing, pal? I'm doing okay. Pally was up. Uh, nothing. Sup, just I just wanted to call you. What up? Hello. What up with that? Yes, sir. Um, then I've got a chapter. I saw last like presidential conference. No, we don't want to talk about that. Uh, why would I waste my time talking? I didn't watch it. And I wanted to discuss it. I mean, there's nothing. The idea of sitting around and talking about bush socks. He's a moron. We already know that. It's boring. Okay. It's terminal. It's ponderous. We already know that. Scary. And the point of it is you got a chance to vote against him in November to get rid of now if we vote by any humongous numbers and say bye, bye, bye. He's making human sacrifice out of hundreds and hundreds of American people over there. He's killing thousands, uncounted thousands of innocent bystanders who are just getting into the way of his plans. And you got a chance to go vote. So, you know, call me every day and I'm tired. He's boring to me. And when I'm boring. No, no. I watched the hockey games last night. And George would make fun of that. But in the meantime, it's much more exciting and interesting than watching Alfred E. Newman, right? Anything would do. In fact, I apologize to Alfred E. Newman because at least he's funny. Right. Which this guy is not. I just, I can't deal with it because he blows. WCWM. Hello. Not anymore. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Who cares what the president says? As long as I got my marlin string, right? There you go. Hey, exactly. Listen. I'm listening to Bob and Tom on the morning now on 90.7. And excellent choice. They're great. The best. Love you, Neil. Thanks. Bob and Tom, baby. Good choice. Two bad we can play most of their bits. One. What? What about Hitchham poop? Can we play that? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. What is coming in? Oh, how was it? Prison. No. Literally. Can't. No. Yeah. Oh well. But we, I tell you one thing. Oh, and you don't even have it in here. You know what? That's one of the reasons that I can't, I just can't be here. Because this DCS is like sterile, right? I'm, you have no idea. This is better here. I know I don't because I've for keep forgetting that you don't have anything in here. Because it'll send it to us. I mean, as soon as I get some good stuff, man, it goes to my DCS. It's loaded with all kinds of stuff. Especially now, now in the day, in this day, in age. When I have to make sure that everything I stick in, it would little star as to risk on it. So it's much easier. Right. It means a little septic. I've got like a little symbol right next to it. Yeah. Make sure I realize that it's been approved for a adult and juvenile audiences. And juvenile members of your government, including the FCC, and those five holes, golf holes.

Oh, well, what is he taking everything so seriously? Why is he so intense with his sports garbage? He's enthusiastic. No, no, no, no, it's not that. He's just he's like. In the same is what he is. He's like a crazy person. That's a bonus here. Yeah. 5 News 70. Sports Talk 62. MS and BCA and CNN still got only 6 votes out of 795. Almost 800 votes. We trust CNN. So we're in a lot of trouble folks. Because you people trust CNN. Can you believe that? Well, I mean, compared to what I think. I have any good choice. Oh, man, the lay person. Where are they going to go? Uh, you're right. No, that is the correct answer right there. Even though I voted for Arnold Palmer. That's that correct answer to be on the bottom. Right. Right.

There has to be a deal for them to be able to call and say whatever they want. And as long as they want, nobody calls back to show more than once. Unless it was like maybe over the years, maybe five times if there was some special Extending waiting circumcise. And you made it pal. You're not it.

Jesus has been afraid in our Lord. Jesus is doing all right. Jesus is doing all right. Jesus gets him a spare time. We're going to put him in a QM line up to replace our from Boca. Anyway, what to do this? Here's the story that you were searching for before. Not a big deal. US warplanes and helicopters firing heavy machine guns rockets and cannons hammered in surgeons today in the besieged city of Haluja and the command of the US Marines here warned that a fragile truce was near collapse. First we're going to kill some people. Then we'll go back to the truce. A rocket hit the Sheraton hotel in central Baghdad breaking windows because he no casualties in the heavily guarded compound. Then houses many foreign contractors in journalist. A second rocket failed to go off was found on the street outside the hotel compound. With officials reporting four more Marines killed the death toll of 87. This is just in size I sat down at this morning. The death toll of 87 US troops in April made it the deadliest months since the military set foot in Iraq. The truce in Philadelphia was severely shaken by fighting yesterday and the this morning. I will Marines underline their halt to offensive operations was still in effect. Even though of course we got a kill so people and but it's a truce. What kind of like that Middle East roadmapsing? The truce is all shut and free. I beg your pardon. Uh oh. Wow. I still can't get over that puts it called here three times. Three times. The former listener. The former listener the one that we lost like I give a crap. You know what I mean? Now you lost a listener. Yeah. Because of the fact that he just don't want to play by the rules. You don't call twice in one day. You said you're thing and that was the end of the one of them say his thing. You say I see well I don't want to let him say his thing. It was just I had a little verbal intercourse with him. It's not like I say goodbye immediately which I should have. And that was it. When you hear the dial tone that means we move on. That's the way it works. See freedom of speech is great. But freedom of speech and calling a talk show are not the same thing. Oh we got it right. That's what the talk is. Yeah right. The constitution doesn't say that you got a certain number of seconds. But 30 milliseconds to call it on a talk show and say whatever it had you want. We're here to entertain the public to amuse to inform to whatever we're in Agrovade. That's what we're here for. In effect, agrovade. Do you want to be pleased? So bye bye. Are you still listening? 5 6 7 0 5 7. I mean that's just it's so sad. You just lost the listener. Great. Great. Maybe you'll call tomorrow and tell us that he didn't listen. Right. 862 votes which of these people are things you care about. Least. I don't think we're going to catch up from that time thing from a clock. No, it's bizarre.

I could tell you about it anymore. You already told us when a man's considering a hair replacement is greatest concern is how natural it's going to look. I'm saloon.

Because Paul's solo album's tank. And there's nothing in our piggy bank. I'm listening. That's why they're willing both of us on stage. Despite our age. To make the sounds of senior. We broke up in the 70's. And now we're nearly 70. Our old boy is no longer planned. And we are both wearing depends. And we won't have the slightest idea what we've played. No hearing aids. To catch the sounds of seniors. Still lots of rupees come backstage. But they all smell like Ben Gae. Most of them got in the show for free. Thanks to the discounts from ARP. And when we come back on stage, you give you the hardcore. We're gonna snore. Because that's the sound. You've seen your... Oh! 147 at 5.60. And now this thing is kicking in gear in the hours flying by. The fun serious. That was the most incredible 4.5 minutes of my life. It was like actually 24 minutes. It's one of those time distortion experiments I do. I'm sitting here and I kept looking up. And I'm thinking to wait a minute. Wait a minute. What's going on over here? And I look at my watch and it's almost 125 already. Like swimming in the shore and getting closer. Well I'll tell you, Duff and Clarets. You're doing a home job, keeping us placed really in tip top shape. Keep everything going. It's just a beautiful thing. It's just a lovely thing. 5.670. 5.660. Oh, I better do this. New reports on US planting WMDs in Iraq. So just keep this in mind. It's on our website. If you want, probably a good idea to print it out. Yeah. And keep it handy. We get our October surprise September surprise. Our July surprise. Whenever it's going to be, then you'll say, Oh, I got this story. Here we know about that. Fifty days after they were saying that US forces were unloading weapons. The message struck in southern Iraq. The first reports. New reports about the moment of these weapons have been disclosed. Sources in Iraq speculate that occupation forces are using the reason on rest in Iraq to divert attention from their surreptitious shipments of WMD into the country. An Iraqi source posted the Bazaar Governor's office told the MNA that new information shows that a large part of the WMD, which was secretly brought to southern and western Iraq over the past month, are in containers falsely labeled as containers of the Marysk shipping company and some consignments bearing the labels of organization such as the Red Cross or USA in order to disguise them as relief shipments. The source was spoke of course on condition of anonymity. And did that Iraqi officials, including forces lawyer of the Iraqi Governor and castle station in southern Iraq, have been forbidden from inspecting or supervising the transportation of these consignments? I can't imagine why? He went on to say that the occupation forces avoided Iraqi officials to forward any questions on the issue they coalition forces. Even the officials of the International Relief Organizations have informed the Iraqi officials, they would only accept responsibility for relief shipments, which have been registered by the organizations. The Iraqi source also confirmed the report about suspicious trucks with fake Saudi injured Indian license plates entering Iraq. At night last, we were stressing that the Saudi injured Indian border guards did not attend to inspect the trucks, but simply delivered them to the US and British force station underwax borders. However, the source expressed ignorance, whether the governments of Saudi were injured or aware of such movement. Right, we don't know no. No, no. Saudi's or Jordanians, we don't have no deal with them Arabs. How do you like that? I hope that stories like that come out of it, even if they're not true, just in case, you know what I mean?
