A QA at Sports Time is 10 o'clock. No Rogers coming up next. What do you say? Let's carry that mall in game today. What are you saying? Oh, Grash. Come on. No, no, we are sports-renuable. I see you. Tell me you QAM. Yeah. Yeah. People are ice-holes. Jesus Christ. No peace-door. Yeah. Are you a bell-git-chants-ed-in-one? Well, now you used to be the star of Lincoln Webvin. Now we're making movies that recruit the vicious. People in the theaters are a pound-ass. It was okay, but what did I put as bad Max? Jesus Christ. No peace-door. Rex, read and the Pope, get it, give it for us. Jesus Christ. Take them look. Don't see the film till you read the book. Jesus Christ. On the streets. Where there was no part to see. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. No peace-door. Jesus Christ. No peace-door. Are you a bell-git-chants-ed-in-one? It is that it was. And all other Cockarite 10.02. 5.60WQ. And Boba got a heavy update today, man. If you're up. Heavy duty plate. Joim Mark, there are fired. They got screwed over off the hill, story. I'd sure like to know the name of that individual back there in the sales room that the stood on a crap up. I'd like to have that name right now, okay? Because I think we'll take up billboards. As if we don't have a bigger fish to fry things to worry about, but QAM is just like Jim Sarni said in the Sun Sentinel of A. The circus at QAM continues. And you are. Absolutely correct. You thumb right on it, Jim. It's a circus. It's a zoo. It's not a place of business. Forget about radio stations. It's not even a Chinese laundry. It's not a place of business. It's a place of monkey business. This one's getting suspended today because he talked bad at this one. And this one's getting suspended because he was drunk at the QAM party. And this one's getting fired because of some picture that was on the internet. Seven months ago that somebody happened to see him passing walking by somebody else's computer. This is not a place of business. And of course, the tip of the iceberg, this, this, all really started. I'm not saying that that he's responsible for all of it. But the ugliness of this radio station started two years ago today. That's a looting. That's right. Somebody this morning. Oh, it's my three year anniversary. And I'm wonderful. And I don't get in the dirt when all those pigs have got right. That's right. That's when it started to go downhill. That's when a whole thing came on glued. And tattooed. And even though he has nothing to do with this latest episode, maybe it's appropriate that he is sporting news radio is a lead in that. Huh? Maybe he can get a zero point zero as his lead in. For that lame ass crap that he's passing off in a morning to that bunch of misfits like old Joe there with the thick voice heard him this morning. Still on the hockey fan. Oh, speaking hockey, let's get that surround right away. Get out of the way. Vancouver cannot forward Todd Bertoozy's been suspended for the remainder of the season, including the final rubber girl season games plus the entire 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs. In addition, Mr. Bertoozy's eligibility for the 2004 or five season, which courses kind of a music is isn't going to be one. We'll be determined by Commissioner Gary Betten and prior to the start of training camp. The suspension is the result of a blind side punch that injured Colorado Avalanche forward Steve more in any shell game number 1028 on March the 8. Enico Zonevallacy, we're two-seable forfeit least $501,000 of his salary. The Akanuk organization has also been fine 250 grand, which that money goes to the NHL Foundation which in turn makes contributions to charitable organizations. In Anico's. So there you go. He's done. And like before the next season, whichever season it's going to be, he's going to have to meet with Gary Betten and decide whether he's eligible to come back. Which I think is appropriate and fine and then let's put his essence in jail on top of it. The course last night, some of you probably saw the the tearful apology you want to apologize. I'm not that kind of a guy. Yes, screw you. Screw you, Bertoozy. Get lost. You can't. More bad news though. A lot of bad news. It's bad news Thursday. QAM. In fact, every day seems to be bad news. A QAM. Yeah. Because Greg just can't get his ass his act together. You're really running a home railroad. Greg let me tell you that. Oh, speaking of railroad. That was a bad choice of words. Powerful explosions rock three Madrid train stations today just days before Spain's general election. Selling more than 170 rush-hark computers and wanting more than 500 in Spain's worst terrorist attack ever. This is the bascepartist group eta. That's what the four-master and a palacio said. It was eta right now. We have to wait till we have an official statement. But it's eta. Which is a lunatic's team. Outlawed basc party, the armed separatist group and yada yada yada yada. Yeah, they want their country back. They want their own country. So, instead of the continues round the world, bad news. In both those papers today, we have stories and I should like to point out that Jim Sarny and Barry Jackass both contacted a radio station and contacted Joe Costello. He did not initiate the calls. Contrary to what was reported to me by a 10 second party this morning since Greg doesn't speak to me directly. He doesn't have the balls to and I don't want to talk to Greg because, by frankly, it's embarrassing. Esmeriz general manager. I mean, you're running a crazy house. You're running a nuthouse and I realize that the industry is under a lot of pressure right now. But if this is the way corporate's gonna react every time somebody first, we might as well close up and open a Chinese laundry. What is that? Huh? Being closed anyway. Chinese laundry right there in a corner of North West, second Avenue and 441 no ticking of shirty. Right. Chinese ficken laundry QM used to be a radio station now. It's a Chinese laundry. Just follow all your garbage. Will we sure got plenty of garbage you're own on the inside? Jim Sarny writes, hey, Goldberg's back on the air. But now Joe and Mark are gone. It's the suspension or firing of the week at QAM. And he says the QAM circus continues. Well, I love, I love that. I'm a frameless article. Whatever I said in the past, Jim Sarny, you're all as forgiven. Okay, you're still ugly as hell. But then against so am I. But I mean, uh, it's all forgiven. You know, you're a puts. The QAM circus continues and you are. Correct. I think I said that but you can't say too often. Absolutely correct sir. Joe can't sell it. Mark Eisenberg, the co-host of the Joe and Mark show two to six a.m. By the way, I hate to break the university. There's another mistake. You're already two to five a. Take away most five to six hours. Especially on his anniversary on the day of his daughter's wedding. The Joe and Mark show were terminated the the Joe and Mark show were terminated. Yes, oh, the co-host. No, the co-host were terminated Wednesday over some old internet photos. Vladimir Lusant and Anthony Jamie. They're not pronouncing me last name. Right. Who the hell knows? Vlad and Anthony were the show's producers were also fired. Did it? You're fired. The photos of adult entertainers taken in the QAM studios appeared on the show's website. But we're quickly removed last September. This is seven months ago boys and girls seven months ago. That's also an error. It was not on the show's website. No, it was on a friend of there's a personal website. It was not on the show's website. It certainly was not a QAM website. It was not our website. Which by the way, we want to make very clear our website has nothing to do with QAM. They don't have a link to us. We don't have a link to them. And the Yamama. Okay. That's just a little disclaimer. There are cases of beesleys are peeing their pants again this morning, which I'm sure they are. Report and Mark keep in mind that this is the guy Greg Reed that put the Scott for well on the year for six months on his radio station. But anyway. Reportedly the photos resurfaced when someone in the years sales office didn't internet search. Then we're seen by a female employee walking by who complained the station management. Oh my God. Oh yeah. She saw it on somebody's computer screen on the monitor. And made us think about it. Now see, I still can't get the message. She filed a formal complaint is what you're telling me. That's what I heard. I don't think so. I heard that she went to the water Nazi who then went to Greg and then of course so this. But why the hell did this some was this something that had to go to corporate in the first place? Why did the people the nose pickers and apels have to get involved in this in the first place? This wasn't somebody on the outside saying, Oh my God, there was something grow test cap in on your radio station. It wasn't even something that was on the air. That's one of the best parts of this whole deal. Anyway, Jim Sarnie says, I runically, Kestella and Eisenberg had changed the tone of their show in recent months and that's also correct. They weren't doing anymore that stripper, Newly we want to be a Howard Stern junior kind of stuff. We'd been getting away from the dirty boys image that Eisenberg who worked at QM for five years. That's not the type of show we wanted. We've released ourselves by taking these photos off the website six months ago. In fact, who was it that coined that term the dirty boys? I think I know who it was. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Meanwhile, Goldberg returned Tuesday from a five day hiatus following a parking lot incident with a sales manager. The umptious unacceptable Luan Winnick. That bitch. We had a meeting and everything is fine. The homper said, the Hebrew hammer. Hebrew hammer. WQM management would not come in on the termination saying it was internal matter. Right. And infernal infuriating matter is what it is. As we continue showing our backside of the world. QAM all asked all day. So let me ask you a question. And here's the very jackass column which did not come from Greg. Greg went out of his way to called up to tell me to pass it down the line. Duptole clearance and parents told George and George told me because Greg told and said, tell that fat olfag that I didn't call either those guys well, that's about time. It's that's once market down George. That's once one time he wasn't the mole. He wasn't the spokesman for Barry Jackass. Million times. As the radio station turns WQM bears the Brut Rights Barry Jackass. Nice going very little putwacker. It says WQM fired overnight host Mark Eisenberg and Joe Custellaw on Wednesday at the station found pictures of them would make it women on the internet, Eisenberg confirmed. Their producers Anthony and the Vlad were also fired. Eisenberg and Custellaw 31 year old so at host at a Ronshi sports in Guy's talk show from 2 to 5 a.m. week that's C. Sarnia Lee's Barry's got the time right. Had pictures taken of them fully clothed with a naked adult entertainer inside the WQM studio on two occasions last September the two women who appeared new in the pictures had been guest on a program which aired with its Zairn'on QM since January 2002. The first new took to pictures who Eisenberg identified as a friend of the program posted them on the internet. Eisenberg said he immediately asked his friend to pull the pictures from the internet but they resurfaced recently and see they thought the pictures were gone. This makes it even more damning as far as the beesleys are concerned. They were positive those pictures were gone. They did everything in their power to make sure those pictures weren't on the internet nowhere know how. But they resurfaced recently where Brutte managed to be attention by a salesperson at the station and by the way it's a power 96 salesperson. Now whatever our anxious QM salespeople but a power 96 person is in work for QAM. You bitch. I'm embarrassed Eisenberg said we apologize it's youthful and discretion. Costella who also hosted a Saturday morning Motorsports show on WQM said it's a bummer. It's a shame something we realized at the time was a mistake came back in bitters. It makes QAM look bad and I feel really bad said Jojo who I talked to last night and uh he's not happy. And I'm real unhappy. Because first of all it was presented to us in a way that yesterday's he and if they would ever give us all the facts. I mean if they say don't talk about it which I didn't yesterday until after they said you can talk about it it was officially were fired. I don't talk about it. But give us all the facts that we have some idea what's going on as opposed to well there was this thing on the website. I thought it was just something that happened in the last few days on the heels of all this FCC hysteria right on the FCC's a Michael Powell's nervous breakdown. That's what we thought it was. And of course if that had been the case well there you go and kind of indefensible. This is over a picture that kind of on somebody's website of some strippers they had on the show seven months ago back in September 2003. And so now we have sporting news radio and at slot 2 to 5 in the morning we had the only live local show overnight in town on his radio station and we continue shooting ourselves in a feet and various in ourselves. That can't afford like a bunch of minor league assholes and we're getting sick and tired of it Greg you're clown. But it was corporate to survive don't give a crap we need strong leadership man we need somebody with some backbone. Somebody with some judgment wasn't going to put somebody on the air for six months ago it was going to jeopardize the station as licensed in all of our livelihoods. Well said. But nevertheless you know when you break like I told you when you break the thing in a first place you can't put those pieces back together again it's the Humpty Dumpty syndrome all over again. He broke the morning show and now we just can't put them pieces back together again. I look what we got now pop I jenco. Absolutely. We got. Hey speaker that are you in a dead end job?

We thought that the QM sales department was bad, but let me tell you something right now. Compared to the Power 96, the sale department, we got a bunch of rocket scientists. Can you imagine one of our people that have our nitwits back there, walking by some of these computer, and look at on the monitor and see some nude pictures, something like that, and then registering a complaint to management? Can you imagine that? No, no, in fact, probably the pictures would have been there anyway. Maybe High Boy, he's kind of sensitive. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a sensitive, black comb, big one. But you people at Power 96, man, you wait just wait and see. I come back to time. I'm going to go right back there and pee on your CD pay off players. Every one of them. We're going to tell all kinds of stories about KidTree and Anna's squeak. You'll see. Ah, we know all those. And of course, the stories about our good friend that used to be in the morning, they're Boa, jangles, Griffin. Oh, and you know something, that inspires me, boys and girls, okay? That inspires me.

It will be my plan that we've played all the time. I don't want to hear no one in doing makeup action. You said it. I didn't say what? I said you said that word not me. You said that word not me.

That's a beautiful thing. 1036. That's a true story. It's matter of fact. Pretty close to it. Other than the fact you didn't blow anybody away. But not right. Sort of that. That we know it. Yeah. Well, she got her wish. Joe got fired. It wasn't because of her. But eventually down to her. Maybe she put a voodoo hex on him. Maybe she got a whole miscleo on it. Two of them put a voodoo hex on Joe and Mark. A jury awarded more than $950,000 when the structure of Roman Catholic principles who accused and out of the cease-priced of punching or during an argument over how to teach. The jury voted $930,000. The jury voted $950,000. Grant to Maria Vega 57 for emotional distress, defamation and battery. Said a returning victim, George. Vega said she was teaching cataclysm at St. M.D.S. Church in November 1999. When the Reverend Dennis O'Neill disagreed with the way she was teaching and punched her right above the ear. What do you like that? And John Gallon is a Jesuit priest and an international and on scholar and author was traveled to the were leading seminars on Catholic, Liturgy and Worship. The jet setting charismatic clerk is also accused of having a sinister side as a child molester. Oh my God. Find the gallons been barred from the Ministry following allegations that he sexually abused the 16-year-old Sylvania boy in 1980 at St. Joseph Church on South Main Street where's this is Delito. The victim now 40 and living in Kenosha was escancing. We received a $50,000 settlement from the Jesuits in 1994. But continued to pursue his case with the Catholic Church until last month. That's when he learned that father Gallon, no technically still a priest, has been barred from performing any priestly functions according to a letter from the Milwaukee Archdiocese of Main Body Toledo Blade. Just a couple more isolated incidents. FCC Chairman, the Anxious Michael Tollis said yesterday that legislation meant to crack down on indecency on the earwaves could run a foul of free speech rights and underbind the overall effort. Well, how do you like that? Could run a foul of free speech rights? I didn't know we had any left. The House and Senate Commerce committees have both passed bills that would sharply boot fines a television radio broadcast to the Violet and Dsansi regulations. They'd also require the FCC to hold a hearing to determine where the broadcast license should be revoked after three violations. Three strikes you out. After speaking to a group of state regulators, Paul told reporters, there are a number of things that give me pause because I don't want to see the remedies being captured by constitutional litigation. Things like three strikes in your mouth, I think, is an understandable idea. But when you think it through, I can imagine scenarios where it can be more problematic than not. Paul also expressed concerns that additional provisions like the one in the Senate bill that would put new media ownership rules on hold, pending a review of links between indecency and consolidation, could end up scuttling the bill altogether. Good. The version has the three strikes provision and permits the FCC to weigh heftair, have to your penalties against the person who orders indecency material on the ear, as well as go after the network that broadcast the material. The FCC can now only find the license station that air the material, and has limited ability to penalize the announcer who will be saying it. The Senate bill escalates fines as much as $500,000, but only once the broadcast has been found to a committed authority in the decency violation, it also has the three strikes in your out provision, yati, yati. So now all of a sudden he's worried about free speech. He's not worried about that. He's just worried that the whole thing's unconstitutionally. He knows that on a phasic, he knows it. He knows it. He knows they're just trying to make things up as they go along. Well, free speech means whatever we say it does. That's basically what America's all about right now. But if I don't give you a solid advance about John Kerry's in that the Republicans are a bunch of liars and crooks and veterans. So on because he's absolutely, you go John, no apologies. You don't know apologies needed. I will let you to see. A good show of involvement should there, even though we didn't know the mic was on. Nevertheless, stand by your guns, baby. Here's the poll for today and it's a we pick up part where we left off yesterday with this. That list we had of the hundred most often mispronounce words and phrases in English. What butchered word or phrase bugs you the most? That's our poll question. It's up there already. I voted for axe. As in, let me ask you a question.

Children die to get astruth in all the resources of the world. Where they look from left to right, when three thousand people die, each accept their life-easy, I was talking about the U.S. or QAM. 1046 at 560 WQAM and I said that with some embarrassment maybe a little bit lower WQAM. I'm thinking of myself about the Howard Stern show that's a taped and broadcast on E on the E network and how it has some of those scantily clad guest on there some of those slots that he has on the board right scantily scantily scantily scantily scantily scantily they're right there on TV on e for people to see all around the country all around North American cable right run and run when they were on w i o d which at that time was owned by religious goodly to use buddy bud packs and run and run had the skankiest nasty strippers used to see I know this comes to the shock boys and girls but this is radio I used to try to tell them that this is a radio the fact that you got all these strippers these brought around naked it you know it may be wonderful for you guys and of course we know what was going on the hallway which I can't say on the year but in a meantime it doesn't do much for the radio speakers you look at the speaker you don't see anything I got to make a stripper on my head right now but the point of the thing being that nobody got fired for that stuff no and how we're sure was still on e as far as I know isn't it sure it is yeah so what's the big deal what's the tinnist that they had a couple of strippers in a building and they had some provocative pictures they had all their clothes on jule and mark and the other guys it's not that they were involved in some kind of a wild orgia or something like that oh by the way yogurt the newspapers won't the floor cut the yogurt why yogurt one of the girls put yogurt on herself on her top yes being careful and the other girl uh removed it and that there you go that's what was that was the subject matter so what does that have to do with anything no just you know just splashing it out for you there yogurt when that's what's the yogurt out let's flavor wasn't sure if I did it have the fruit on the bottom I'm sorry maybe a freaking cross would have been in the fruit would have been on the bottom because I understand that's coming for him anyway I don't want to listen I don't want to go there you know girl friend we have to be very very careful we don't want to go there even at one word there I noticed in at the in the bow and josego but nonetheless that's a comedy but you know we've played it in the middle times the inward old jeet and too bad there's a cleaner bit the uh boat got the power I don't want to play a cleaner bit there was nothing wrong with that bit but everybody is so I mean seriously if you're going to get we might as well just play music okay I'm really really mean this if you people who own this radio station and who are running it and I use that term very loosely if you're that panicky about everything let's just place a nice safe music we got out of jingles right we got all the more jingles we could uh you know crank up on a blast from the past right now all right that's one of my favorite rices matter fact he's right yeah but anyway something to think about nothing of my contract is I have to do with talk shows has been a ranger show you a ranger show could be playing oldies how much has started that today until these people come to their senses till it gets a better grip on life let's start at the beginning I've seen some people come on glued but I mean you talk about a real desperate reach to come to a rationalization to fire a bunch of young guys and the sad part of it is these are good guys these are guys who are going out of the way to try to let go over to line they've cleaned up their act the last several months they get at the understand they were going to a lot more scrutiny and pressure now they get it sure happens to be a good guy good friend of mine a good friend of George's never stole a freight train no and uh that's a good job I mean it's a it's the only live show in a market to the five more so you suspended guys for a week okay to pacify the nervous neles over their enables corporate you know you'll be a suspended for a few days doctor pay which I'm sure I can make much different anyway yeah like hey more to be on exactly but to blow them out of there to fire them they's the um the fact that we got some humorless bitch in the building that I accidentally supposedly walked by somebody's computer and saw a picture on a website and went crying wow I'm offended everybody's offended it's like the show is though this one's offended by this well you know something if we had a worry about offending people all the time we wouldn't say anything because you can say hello reverse you might just defend somebody am I right absolutely yeah here's a guy I think about him I'm offended without hearing anything from him I'm just offended no one that he's working there still would have story about the bullet my head and uh let's get George fired I mean they're they're talking about uh um an unacceptable workplace did he ever get suspended oh did he get canned oh no nothing happened to him to get to find oh no he's done a zillion things at least I've heard of that any normal workplace he'd have been can't a long time ago but again they're peeing in their pants they're scared of his lawyer and they're scared of this one they're scared of their own shadow must be those big numbers he's good now must be why he's still there and I just use more than example they're I don't want to like pick on him do I yeah he's an excellent example very very sad I'm I'm gonna crank up the music I think we'll get a few more choices for our pool here what do you think I think you should start at the beginning of the oldies like the very first piece of recorded well how about the rock around a clock by bill hey it was the first rock and roll record so they say in the first uh like on the tin foil on the hand crank Mary had a little man was it all right I think it was it let's go to the history the recording industry right but I don't have that long left on a deal let's see unless you finish it on sure WQAM hello yes sir how does one person get somebody fired from what the contract their live with it four people four people got far not one but I mean one person made a complaint right right before people got canned so that mean if I make a complaint against something can I come down there get somebody fired or get a commercial taken off the air probably if you're chicken working here probably I mean I don't I don't have a lot of power I mean it's an American somebody hasn't got you up here it's really a miracle they tried they tried pretty damn hard for long time yeah that asshole in Miami I'd love to see him in person JTO whatever's like I said I don't know whether this one works or not five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a 18 year horizon wireless line always always the setup calls always a little test a little ain't gonna work ain't gonna happen WQAM hello yeah yeah yeah yeah you really sound like these guys uh they kind of look pretty cute to get rid of these guys because it doesn't sound like anything that would about to a firing offense to me no of course not so you know it's kind of scary what's going on was what's on the radio these days when it and I haven't hear them you go overnight and uh they were kind of railing against the FCC against Bush and uh you need to think that that was linked to it so if that was the criteria you know I mean you know if if not in Bush was uh get you off this radio station I wouldn't have been on this morning you know I've been off a long time ago well different with you though you see if they take you off they'll be a pretty large human cry so you know if they take these guys off and you know of hardly anybody notices but it's kind of scary what's going on and you know I just don't actually good people keep getting jerked around away Hank got jerked around last week and these guys getting blown out of there this is this is unacceptable the overreacts of the century I mean you know if they would have done something that put the license it's jeopardy or or done something a harm somebody else that works there but but you know for something that innocuous it's pretty pathetic it's embarrassing thank goodness that they decided not to regulate cable but you know these these people are they you gotta have people right the FCC to tell them you know you have to you have to be proactive about that because it's it's really scary it's the first amendment we're talking about here yeah it's uh it's supposed to be a free country good luck was paling yep see you at the port okay see if the reporter control five six seven all you know and never even mentioned this the other day after Robert passed to rally daddy was only forty nine who played the the scuba house painter painter held in on Murphy Brown okay you didn't know who that was what they showed it on the news they said to that was but I never watched Murphy Brown yeah uh corners office said I might have been a drug overdose that we

Eldon's work never seemed to get done because of his high artistic standards spend much of its time mentally and Murphy's life often dispensing sage advice he finished work with John Kervolder last month on the movie be cool the sequel to the comedy get shorty he played a hitman and now he's dead he died yes he did five six seven oh five six give it get some more choices here for our poll I'm sure what to butcher to word or phrase bugs you the most so far acts as opposed to ask how can a s k b acts okay is there any exynat how about triple x oh god forbid acts for ask is got ninety four already 137 nuclear nuclear for nuclear which are a little bit president says thirty four especially for especially and I don't want to say where we hear that all the time six jewelry for jewelry

nothing all me mister oblivious I'm an idiot and that I'm lousy at management too I've got the right at a two four when things go wrong you know I just ignore it my life I said he said inside the abbreviation and I've got more money than you call me reprimand civil why not your dispense of all outside of the relationship I don't care what you say or do I've just turned the other cheat when the sales polls lie on me and the number's died down the truth so not just a single boy in me it's just a great bit quite a me I've got to get to my trailer by truth to pick up my brand new books rubber Oh!

Don't think I have to parade the mommers parade, the homers parade, so we can't play that. Go seriously, let's play some duo, what do you say? Yeah, why not? Gotta feel like I'm going back to the beginning. It's a few end duo shots! Or people who listen to that duo upcrack, man, they need mental help. What is that? What is that all about? Bad. The duo upshot. It ain't really good. What do you mean, is it, though? Well, I still say that Bob Hamilton, Magic's an asshole, even a way to cancel and do up myself. Because he took off that guy that had the duo upshot, and it got a lot of people really been out of shape. Right? Right. 560560, pound 560, on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. 127 votes for Axo Far and Nuclear as opposed to nuclear is about 42. Everybody else, small potatoes so far. We might not have a long list today, because I'm just in that kind of got to hear up my ass. You know what I mean? Rather real, real here. Here's line 9, QAM. ADL, I don't. Okay, sir. Now, we want to add to the list. Yes. I was just thinking about this. It's that, you know, the word with WITH. How about with? In the list. I brought my gloves with me. That's a classic example. You know, WIV with IFF. Oh, with me. But what about with me? With, yeah, with this. I think with WIT's more. Yeah, it's new now. Okay, thanks, Paul. Okay, bye. See? Make a hole for the runner. Put it on her. Or with or with. I mean, WITH with is not all that difficult. Okay. With not that tough. Hey, everybody. Everybody. Everybody. Who's the one. Who's the one. Who's the one. Who's the one. Everybody. Who's the one. Yeah, I think we ought to go on strike the old station until Joe and Mark are reinstated. You know, suspended for a few days, pacified the corporate and get a back on here. Quit the crap. Quit sticking with his radio station man. What's going on? These, uh, few last couple of weeks is unbelievable. This is, it's unacceptable as what it is. I'm just, I mean, we could just hit still a roll over for it and watch everybody in. All the pieces of the puzzle just dropped, you know, piece by piece. Oh, what do you got up? God tell you what you got. Let's crap. You got nothing left. I said it yesterday. Yeah, even the day before before we knew that this crap was going out with Joe and Mark. I said it the other day. I'll say it again. It's like sitting inside the ruins of Pompeo and it's all just crumbled around you. And that's what's happening. We're seeing it. Just crumbling. Just peeing their pants. June Allison, I understand is over there in Naples now. Doing a killer business. Handing out the pants by the boatload. I like this story. Son of Game Marriage for Wedd's in San Francisco. This is great. This is kind of like Dick Tainian is a dick daughter. David Knight, son of the state senator who was the author of the California ballot measure The Spanish name of the Spanish name is Marige. Defied his father's law and wed his partner of 10 years Tuesday in a quiet ceremony, attended by just two friends in San Francisco City Hall. A rockstone loudwriter tried to put me down. A top to grand staircase of city halls wrote unto the night and Joe Lazarov Baltimore stains the rings and were pronounced spouses for life one month after senator William Peat Knight. Republican upon day proclaimed San Francisco same-sex marriages nothing more than a side show. He said pop to you pop this. What is that picture again on CNN? There's father Tuesday cut. Yankees and the Eut Jersey and Delta's people in the head. You clown you. Yeah. Oh here it is again in slow mode on CNN. On a safe. That's nice for you. There it is. Big shot for the head. Here it is. Here it is. Again. Fuck. Bird man. Wow. Like I said, why not put it on an endless loop you crazy bastard in CNN? Just put it on there over and over again. People I wouldn't know a hockey puck from a lender's bagel and they're just showing it. Be just to make it look bad. Whatever they can do to make it look grotesque. Because of one incident. Let never less. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon world of slime. I got a lot of music. In fact, I could go out today and buy a whole bunch of music. What you don't have, we got here. That's right. And I forgot about that. WQM. Hello. Pretty good. Pretty good. What's going on in that station? Yeah. It's pathetic. I'm a loyal fan of Joe Marks and I will admit it. Right. My judgment might have been clouded but when I hear it's this. I mean if it would have been something set on the air with the sexual connotation or some Right. You know, considering the political climate going on now. This is a bunch of BS. It's totally BS. I'll picture on our friends website that they thought was the race was long gone anyway that somehow and this is what I loved and how come the power 96 salespeople managed to pull us up and leave it on a monitor somewhere so that something could walk by and see it. But somehow somebody saw it and it got offended by it and made a big think about it. This is so I mean such a reach and a stretch. It's just pathetic. And even I like to show it because what you said. It was a local show. Right. It was a good start. It's a local interest and it was good. I know somebody started on the overnight. You know how that's the beginning for them. They could have worked the way up to it but you know better time slot. Eventually when nothing new in the dinosaur but you know what I'm talking about. Dara you know move on to the world. Right. You know and they started everything. They've been over backwards at that station for them. You know to go to QAM management as I asked them to do things and they've done it. First of all they started they were money to Friday. Okay. When most of it started his little BS about how to leave it on Sunday. Then it was Sunday through Thursday because Mo was bitch and belly can he had have a lead in. Exactly. And then when the whole change over was got he came over that they took away one of the hours from the show. They said finally. And then I know for a fact that working without a contract so they got blown out. Well I don't know money to back them up. Right. You know and that's what pissed me off. We want you on mark back on next Monday night. Next Sunday night. I agree with you. If I want to finish this thing. I don't listen to him. I only hear five minutes when I first come in here in the morning and get everything straight. No but I don't have any idea what he was saying. But I think that everybody on this radio station ought to go to bad for Joe and Mark because they're good guys. I mean he overnight isn't like a major component as far as ratings or making any money. But it's just a principle of it. I mean there's nothing that these guys did here that should earn them getting canned. Nothing. You know and that's what makes me more man than anything. I agree with you. I'm going to spend a week or two weeks of I got back to pay. I think they knew we were said it would have been fine. But to get blown and not just one person four people got a set of others. And four people that have been loyal to that station. Okay. And they're just I don't understand what's going on Neil. I mean obviously there's something going there's gotta be more of this story than what's going on. There's personal way to have an act to go in with them or something. But I don't even understand that because Joe Mark like. If you keep in mind this is somebody inside the building who doesn't even work for a QAM. This is some sales bitch from power 96. Well I wish I had that name. Hey well I'm working on it. Take a new. You too. You know they not only are showing the virtuos the more thing they're showing they just had a montage of hockey collisions and fights. And catch and make the postseason. They'll be no good. Oh my god you people at CNN. Seriously they ought to be pulled off here. They're obscene. Make them a stake about if they need to be yanked right off the earth CNN. The world will be a hell of a lot better place for it. How many people have been? Huh? Maybe they could sell a highlight tape of that montage. Oh man. Just frost my and here I thought all the same everything was going along so well. We got to humper a crisis straight enough the other day and we go from one crisis to another crisis. We had the feral business and then we had the hank business. And we got to do a mark business. We had the never ending mob business. Yeah. The mob goes on the mob not just gets. I'm happy anniversary by the way. You have no excuse discussing old Cooot. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh. If you look up old Cooot in the dictionary there he is. With that piece. How come this thing doesn't want to play? I can't even play my music now. I'm getting my CD player when I'm strike. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. I like that. The moon is part of it. The kakamunes. The moon will blow. The moon will blow. Oh the moon those.

I think we're losing contact with reality. At least I am. I'm speaking for myself now. I think that the QAM effect is just, I'm just losing it. Now, reality's boring anyway. That's true. Who do you want to be a real? This is real. Oh! Oh, rock! I think it's a part of your story. You better not pick on Ann Murray. She'll come to your house and beat the crap out of you and your whole family, man. She will. Yeah. It's a man who picked on Ann Murray. Or is it? I think the name is, there's a commenter.

By the way, did a Johnny Depp pictures come out? What's it called? I don't know. Yeah, you do. A secret window I think. That's a secret window. The thing about Johnny Depp, we signed a fact that he's such a great guy. Looks pretty good. Uh, that makes him a great actor. You know what it is? What? He never is the same twice. If you think all the different movies he's been and he's always he's never Johnny Depp playing somebody else. He's always some different freaky strings, whatever, you know? Right. Like Johnny Depp. As opposed to like the actors that, well, I spent your Tracy who was always a Spencer Tracy. I mean, no matter what. No matter what. Yeah. I hate to say it like all the Tina was becoming. Al Pacino's become the same thing except the course that one. Glenn Gary. As a matter of fact, I don't even know if you're aware of this.

What do you see get off talk that way to a working man? We're taking outside. We have people trying to do business. That's what I came in for. That's what I'm trying to do. I mean, I'd be disabled.

You don't see no pornographic pictures, no more. On somebody's monitor. And the way to solve it is just to keep them blinders on. Don't be taken a peek every now and then. Probably a good idea. WDQAM. Hello. I knew it was up, man. Yes sir. I was over to you on Mark, man. You know what I meant? They need to handle there right now, man. I want to know. I want to know that you heard the song.

Don't be hungry. You and precious. WQAM, hello. I knew this is Kym and I got another highly mispronounced word for Kym. Okay, Tim laid on us. What is it? Birthday. Birthday. Birthday. B-I-R-F. Birthday. Yeah. My birthday. Exactly. Well said. Thanks a lot, Tim. Okay. Why do people say that? I mean, I just don't get it. See, the thing to me is when you hear other people speak and you hear them say, can I ask you something? Why do you say, well, ask me anything you want. I don't get that. I don't understand it. You can hear the way other people speak. You hear the way the word is supposed to be pronounced. And you just talk crap. I don't get it. When those other people are a different color and you have contempt for their color. No, what about nuclear? Nuclear. Oh, that's just a literacy. Chiny Carter. President Bubba. Are you picking on our president Bubba again? Well, this one. Double Bubba. Good. Rubba Bubba? I think that's in the mic. That's nothing. Rubba. 560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless 9. If you tune in late, we've had a real massive QAM again. For sympathetic advice to ourselves, Bitshit power 96, who was offended by some images on somebody's computer screen there in the power 96 sales department in the bullpen, whatever they call their thing, and the bullshmit pen. And what crying demand is meant in the course management rather than handling it intelligently and just saying, well, let's give her an apology and it's unfortunate. They got to go to corporate crying, oh gee, we got to make your problem here. Oh, it's you know. And corporate said the fire is you and Mark. And the to and Mark and flight and Anthony, they're gone. They're done. They're fired in history. And we're trying to do whatever we can to bring these people back to their senses. And if you want to, like I said, suspend him for a little while, cut off those big pay checks, but cut the crap. Okay, quit this embalming, this radio station. What is it going to stop? That's what you're seeing. You're seeing the disembowling of WQAM, which is pretty damn strong words, but that's what they're doing to it. You need a lot of, I guess because it's a sports station, maybe if it's right, you need a lot of an escrow card and a pencil that a bigger racer on it. WQAM, hello. Hi, is this George? Yes. How are you? Pretty good. How you know? I'm all right. Wanna speak to Neil? Yeah. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Pretty good. Let me just hang on one second. Go ahead. Just want to net down. I want to let you know that your show is phenomenal. It is. That's phenomenal. And the price is right, too. And what the basis me is how little down here, in self-lory, you can listen to. And what I can't get over is the, how this country is going exactly in reverse. And I wonder, what I'm wondering, is, could you comment on why in the hell are we such a concerned? What do you say why in the one? Why in the heck, I'm sorry. Why is this such a, I imagine a musco back to the puret and found it. Yes, that's right. It's just incredible to me. I mean, I, I, I, I sent an email that night that I heard about how we're going off. To clear channel to the FBC. It's just, it's just incredible. I'm like, oh, we becoming a third world country. I mean, here I'm, I'm sitting here. I've got a computer that's got like 5,000 comedy bits in it. And I've got to sit here, ping in my pants. Try to figure out which ones will not offend Michael Powell, which ones we can still play on here. And we've been playing this stuff for like 20 years now for, for more than 20 years. And students been doing his act for over 20 years. And now we got to cut this out and we can't do this. And we don't want to offend him. This is really scary. And a public is just oblivious. They just have to prove it. I agree with you 100%. CNN is busy showing a hockey thing a 4 million times an hour is opposed to saying, hey, guess what? The bill of rights is going down the toilet. Absolutely. In fact, to me, the only news that I can watch is the movie. The only news like I watched down here is BBC News. Yeah, very good. Because the rest of it to me is totally tabloid nonsense. In fact, I'm glad you mentioned that. The state of high-end alerts prior to elections. Well, no, we knew that. There you go. They're showing all embodies and Madrid now. Let me ask you a question. Where do you broadcast from? Where do I broadcast from? My apartment in Toronto, man. Oh, you're living up there. Well, I would go part of the time. Interesting. Because I'd love to go to work for you guys. Because like, I'm sure. I'm sure. Well, stay tuned. I'm going to be a lot of opening soon as what I'm hearing. I'm very. I said, good luck to you, pal. Take a good look. He'll keep up the good work. There's like, okay. Don't step up a 4-0. Because it's a famous in death. It's not out of you. It's a 4-0. It's a 4-0. What? Yeah. You want to work here? I'm going to leave you. Thanks a lot. Okay. You got it. What is it? Oh, no. You're never going to hit. You're going to show me the 186th dead now. More than a thousand who didn't know 10 blasts in Madrid. From those, uh, relax. Yeah. I'm both fast. I'm going to go on the top. I'm going to go on the top. I'm going to go on the top. That's wrong with the little moatown. I think we get at least a 2-0. Don't you? Yeah. I think that would teach them a lesson in Tudu. Start is start re-evaluating their whole approach to life. And this this Greg read, you know, Cowering off into closet somewhere and telling Duff and clearance to come and tell me this and tell me that. I mean, come on. Grow up already.
