No, we're gonna fight it, man! Go! Another thing. Yeah, those are the main words of the mixed law. I know, but I don't know. It doesn't mean it fits. We can watch how you expect to get anywhere in a beauty field. We can watch. We can see you. If I can make a difference, I'd rather have a little bit more. What just happened? What just happened? What just happened? What just happened? What just happened? What just happened? Yeah, what about? So, why did you? What do I do? What do I do? I'm gonna fight it, man! I wanna die! I'm gonna fight your tech every day. You know, Joe, he'll be a little bit more. I'm gonna hit the cold. I'm gonna fight it, man! Why you, why are you the special? I know my skill attract you. But I'm gonna fight you. You still got such a... I feel just like that you are my kid, brother. And what you need to do with that? That's why you're so much fine. I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! I'm gonna fight it, man! Alright, guys, that's enough. It's 10.02 or 5.60WQ. I'm happy Wednesday, too. What the hell was that that we get our following now? What was it? Ben Hitler. I'm not talking about the song, which as Grootessia's a was. I'm just talking about that. Whatever it was. I don't know. See, we, we on this show, we have our own personal program director. Right? I'm thinking maybe eight to ten should have its own personal program director. First year, so we seem to be having some problems there. Last eight to ten, we had some very serious problems with that whole deal. As you may recall, I'll take your children. Salam, just in Haitian. Right? And now the correct eight to ten, we seem to be having, I don't know, what, where was it? Joe Rose this morning. I don't know. And then, of course, we get the big, oh, is really like a stance through our heart. I mean, that's just unbelievable. In prime time when people are awake, when people are like, really listening? Oh, man, that is brutal. Not a bad guy, you know, we have a story of freight train, but Jesus putting him on the ear. What do you think about guys? Man, that is tragic. Anyway, and I guess he was given away more marlin tickets. I don't want to hurt her at the end of my correct about that. I don't hear these things. How can you miss it over that Van Halen crap or at the end of my heart? Van Halen. That sounds to me like sabotage. That would be like, hey, Luis Miguel records at the end of the show. There's a thought. Yeah. I like to mad dog. We don't want to do that, Tim. Well, thanks for the copy of that boy. Long overdue, you idiot. Man, that cares another one. Another real, oh, when I'm all listening, everything's fine. Oh, we're fine. Except more dead people all over the world. Carbom killed 68 in Iraq. Suicide attack was detonated. Samletin is carbom against police buildings during rush hour, den a killing 68 people, including several children. As many as 20 children. In the bloody state, this man, the Shiite city, since the US, and occupation began, here we go. Since our Iraqi attack. Iraqis pulled charred and torn bodies from angle vehicles in front of the Saudi police station, located by the Saudi police station, located by Bosworth, Crowder, Main Street Market. One of three stations in a police academy had just after 7 o'clock a.m. There are time by total of five carboms of about 200 people in the city of the dead were wounded. Two bands passing by the Saudi station were destroyed. One carrying Kindergarteners. The other taken girls to middle school. Dead children burned beyond recognition were taken a hospital morgue. There's the operative sentence in this story. Oh, thank you Mr. President. Thank you Tony Blair for all of our dead bodies. Thank you for your emancipation by the capitation. emancipation by elimination. Dead children burned beyond recognition were taken a hospital morgue. Now of course some of those apologists for the bushmyshter would say, Well yeah the Americans didn't do this. Well that's the point. The fact that there were there this is why this is all going on. That's why we turned that country into like a a festering nightmare. And. Explore. It's heard in the Saudi capital. Oh, right. I'm thinking that myself that is an all bad. No. It's good. I mean if they're going to be terrorist activities, let's have them all happen in Saudi Arabia. And maybe a couple of them Pakistan. I'll be careful because they got the bomba. I'm going to bomba. Good. And they see maybe several explosions have really damaged the headquarters of Saudi security. Today, coming to people into her injury, dozens of police officials said, Initial reports indicated the blast came from at least one car bomb, but other than that. Oh, we're fine. It's been out of my last night for the one big parade. Or talking to one to a clock at the morning here last night. A nice bomb boys. Now let's move on. It's still for the office. It's going to be brutal. But anyway, we don't want to get in that hockey talk to me. The big story that A.S. seems to me in addition to the grotesque stuff happened around the world. And of course, this is how I write into it. Is this talk about the, do we dare say that five litre word? Sports? Draft. Oh. Wow. The field of rap in here. Only then I have no window open, but I feel a draft. Yeah, they're talking about it. What's that all about it? A senior Republican lawmaker said that the theory rating security in Iraq thought everything was fine. Oh, we're fine. The theory rating security may force the US to reintroduce the military draft. Oh, my God. There's not an American who doesn't understand what we're engaged in today and what they've prospered out for the future. It said Senator Chuck Hagle, Republican in Nebraska. He told that to the Senate for relations committee hearing on post occupation, Iraq. See, one of the problems along with all the other lies, and all the other BS, and all the semantics of the trying to play. Is that they had an entrance strategy, but they didn't have no exit strategy. Which is always the easiest part, you know, getting in, especially when you've got more troops and you've got more bombs and more money and more everything else than anybody else. It's always really easy to go and invade somebody else, but as we found out in Vietnam, and we found out over and over again, and it ain't so easy getting out. They had no strategy for what we were going to do once we got in there. None. Zero. In fact, I noticed Joe Biden and Carl 11 and the hearings yesterday. The Senate hearings were just both busting a gut, screaming, yelling, carrying on about how these people, these supposed military planners, didn't have any strategy for what they were going to do once they won the warface so called. We were supposed to have to do anything flowers and that's where I can be a flower. They thought it was going to be a walk in a park. Didn't turn out that way, did it? No. Our hand picked government. They were supposed to take to them. Chuck Hagle says, why shouldn't we ask all of our citizens to bear some responsibility and pay some price? Are you in that we still encompassary military service with force or citizens who understand the intensity and depth of challenges we face? So we're going to be sending us some people of the borders here in Canada because there going to be a lot of visitors try to come in. Knock in the doors down. I'm not going to get an against down trying to get in again, just like very Vietnam. Not too many people. And not too many parents are we going to see their kids carted off and be slaughtered again? It's like we didn't get non. I'm sure everyone will be proud. Another network that's totally unjustify, totally unnecessary. that has nothing to do with the security of America, nothing over the world. They had him by the short hairs, they had him right with a wanted woman, they could have kept in their dang-lan and that line for as long as they wanted. Old Sodom. But nevertheless, Hagle says that a draft which ended in the early 70s would spread the burden of military service more equitably among various social strata, right, like we're really supposed to believe that the sons and daughters of the elite are going to be a march-dock towards. Anybody believe that? Oh, as a matter of fact, during Vietnam, when we had the draft, were the sons and daughters of the elite who were brought back in body bags? No, no. 58,000, most of the middle and lower class people, many, many minorities, they're the ones that came home in body bags. Oh, would they look that happy to get with it? Because some of them are elite. I don't want to mention what last name I might have, like, say Bush, some of them are elite. They want to put, you know, a funny, balloon military service. They don't want to get in the middle of the crosshairs. Those who are serving today in dying are in the middle of lower middle class so they're chucking, and that's exactly the way it's going to be. The call to consider it imposing the draft comes just days after the Pentagon moved to extend the mission to some 20 and 135,000 troops in Iraq, and they're not done with that, by the way, we don't have enough troops. For all the adventures that we want to carry on around the world, we have more than enough troops to get as far as taking care of terrorism. But if we want to start adventureism and invasions and occupations, that's in a mystery and palpitations, some credits of the US law documentation complain that military planners use two few troops to subdue Iraq, and then insist that more military muscle will be needed to restore order. Now that we've gotten ourselves into this mess from which who knows when we're going to execute us. They're saying minimum 10 years, naturally we have to mystic. And by the way, they need a lot more money too. Oh, yeah, I guess I'll mention that. I got it right here. The pull we took yesterday, the most important editor, while we before we do that, two things. Heather Graham is our behind-the-be to curtain our gal today. We'll give you an order. I'll never stop Josh that run in the sea so fast. Really? Yeah. She's there. Quick and quick. Okay, click this.

Norris McWorder co-founder of the Guinness Book Records, the final arbiter on everything from the fastest time of honor to the world's longest hot dog as died, he was 78. There was longest weeny. The court has suffered a heart attack yesterday after a month, Monday, I'm sorry after playing tennis at a sermon, Wilchurch, Southern England, a family spokeswoman said. The first Guinness Book appeared in 1954, Edited in Coupard by McWorder and his twin brother, Ross, who was murdered by the IRA, the Irish Republican Army in 1975. Norris McWorder continued Edited the Guinness Book Records to the 1980s, since remaining as advised we had to re-till editor to lie these things. What do you say? By 64, the books were selling a million copies a year. Sale top 40 million in 1981, the 2004 edition nearly 300 pages long with world records regarding everything from war piece and politics to astonishing feats of food consumption. Why didn't know the Beast made the Guinness Book Records? Did you? He will say. He sure will. He's blowing up like a gigantic balloon like somebody stuck a gigantic bicycle pump up his ass. Wow. You talk about June, he's busting out all over. Man, oh man, a beast. A giant in the broadcast industry five years, say so myself. Well, we got a lot of fat people.

Christians maybe even some of them Jews they wouldn't be killing so many people but because of the fact that they're like gutter muslims man because they worshiped that Mohammed because Christianity and Judaism are not Middle Eastern religions after all and don't forget nobody ever got killed in the name or Christianity or Judaism that I Maybe by accident I got no way of a bullet that is correct let's all these little kids this morning. He said to go to school Here's the apple for today the most important athlete of the 20th century was or is Here's what I got so far what I put on in myself because now see open up this panor and of course No athletes are important that thought that was important to put on there because there are a lot of people in our audience It'll give a flying crap about sports and they'll enthusiastically chime in and vote for no athletes are important Even though I didn't have a they may have a point But then again you could see no entertainers are important knew everything is relative You just based on your own gut feeling. Okay the most important athlete of the 20th century was a Babe Ruth Your Montana Dan Marie note a pass by the dolphin people Thai Cobb Jackie Robinson of course Robius reasons Joe de Majio Jim Brown That's a list I got so far. I don't think I died on the facts in all the era kind of original facts We as a let's say you got him we got him You have Jim Brown on there. I know that you said that no I did not I said you're long time ago You even know who that is Who beat up his wives and girlfriends actors and Brown was the one who he said it was all of them So what are you talking about them? Don't tell me you don't know Jimmy Brown about 30. He was great. He was great And then of course he turns out to be a Doodle bag or what do we decide on and we didn't decide on one for that We got do bag, but then what's the S1 we haven't done that yet? How about a slum bag? Okay, I noticed it's like since means Yeah, and I slug sounds too much like Fag we got all ready to you maybe It does How about this? A scrum a scrum of course is very big like in some of the British sports in rugby where they'll get around on it And they're all gravity tellers, but I've been doing Scrum bag. What is this? I like that a scrum is when you get down on the ground and all they throw the ball in the middle Everybody tries to grab all of this And the ball too. We can't even talk about that and how we can Scrum bag I think that's fine. It's got my squeal of approval. How do you like that give it a squeal We'll thank you It's got the Q and squeal of approval is scrum bag. Hey, if anybody wishes about that You know what they're gonna have to come face to face no so no toe to toe with me. I know my scrum is okay And we got a few scrum bags in Ed building most of the sales department and engineering So anyway, that's the whole question. We'll get a lot of choices now Tucker fast and of course I was way ahead of you Tucker on this one because I knew people would be saying this and I agree Without question well, I wouldn't go that far Jackie Robinson is the most important athlete of men who transcended sports Actually made a difference in the real world. Well, he broke it color variation baseball no question about that I got one yes, I just drove to Matthew. Oh, who I voted for yes? What about the Jesse Owens Jesse on 1936. Pizzo Hitler. That's right in Baris Hitler said hey in his best year She said what does that scarcy do when I've been money? You know I thought was most of the czar Jesse Owens A man who was running for his life. I think it'd be a little bit of a She Munich but yeah, you ran like a man a life like a man a life like a dark. Oh, it's good one so fast I always told you that because they got a lot of practice over the years from being chased Yeah, in fact even Jessica Lynch made some comment about that because when she came back from overseas They had a regular like a Lynch mod the meter But it anyway, so Jesse Owens great So that's our list so far. I'm sure that this the suit audience will add lots and lots and lots and lots more names even more than we really want tomorrow. We got a fantastic day. You want to know why? Why? Because we got a ball game Marlins who won last night three to one. Maybe Philadelphia was you know who was don't you? Don't trail learned this spell with Don Trello give a bully for hits now. He gave up a run Dang it. It finally gave up a run. He only put six and two Thursdays and so what's that all about huh? We're getting pretty excited. We're getting pretty exasperated Dr. Clasi went over three to play and I take the box score We went over three so we got the a win and it was nice another nine and four, but you know come on, Don Trello Let's watch it up a little bit all right this business you give enough a couple of hits in her and not getting any hits yourself That's no more than you want to say No, what do you say?

I have a lot of respect for Howard Stern I have a lot of respect for his view pollot holds San Donelson During the Paris course annual one on one interview at the show It just doesn't happen to be the law Indeed, Paul noted that it's the law he must follow regardless of what he made feel personally because the Supreme Court's already ruled That in decent species only partially protected are the first amendment and broadcast in decent C can be punished by the FCC Paul said if I go out on my own because they have a different view of the first amendment than the Supreme Court That would be an application my responsibility in a dereliction of my duty is what he said what a pile of crap duty Yeah He's doing his best to do his duty like a good boy scow, you know just like daddy good scow Even though he knows that a lot innocent people are done and that the whole thing was a sham in a charade from the beginning just like daddy The end of good scow for the atroops Speaking of talk radio It was on then it was off then it was on again and out of the off again boy Aroamerica radio the recently launched liberal talk radio never they begin in broad last week in a financial dispute with the owner of its Chicago An L.A.

The CIA makes judgments that they now regret. Falling into terror is a fall on seas. We just need more answers from the men who seem to need to know. We need to know. What for sure about 911 we need to know. What for sure about 911 we need to know. Yeah, how come he sold a handset with Prince Eddola? Because they don't come no more duller than him. I'll tell you that right now. How so Bush House has said the answer to that book, Carl Unger, was the next word on the Overson Ungers. He was on one of the shores of the night. MSNBC, I believe. Okay. And then we're talking about this grow test this. And in fact, even on CNN on Crossfire yesterday, believe he or not, the Republican guy they had on there. You know, whether you're left against the right now that can try and crap. Even he was excoriating the Bush people for this grow test relationship. They have a lot of Saudis. And they showed all the stats about 15 of the 19. High jackers were Saudis. All the southern Garbage. And of course, the wasabi. I mean, Wahabi. All these, no, seriously, all these schools that they built, not just in Saudi Radio, but in Pakistan, they export this hate of the West. And so on a one hand, you know, like I said, a plumber would one hand kiss in with a mouth and then stab in you back with it or hand. It's pathetic. I say, let's bomb Saudi Arabia right off the bat. And if I let's not do it, well, let's just Tom, we're going to do it. Yeah. I told you this the other day, just send him all to the French Riviera. Let him take a few billion, you know, just like you have a good time. And it will just hook up our hoses. 50 cents a gallon for gas, tops. Hey, Aaron, somebody says, how can we leave off? You're old, number 44. Henry Aaron. Right, Josh? Right. I think that's a very nice thing is a scandal. I'm disgusted and nauseated, but even though we got some people on the station who kisses ass, I mean, his, whatever he accomplishes, in fact, I noticed that his last home run was number 666, which I find that's something appropriate there. Don't you? 666. Oh, my God. Yeah, he may be the anti-Christ, very bonds. Stir-roid, laden, phony piece of crap. Put an asterisk on any records he says. Tell me of that right now. Here's odds. Let's see. I'm a die-hard, cartonless fan, but this great center of field where for the carton, single-handedly destroyed the sport of baseball, you're right. Kurt Flodd, three agency. Kurt Flodd, you got it? Got it. As in, flooding your pants. Casey Stangle, my favorite line says this fact, so he mans one of the teams in the 66-all-stair game and saying, Lewis, it was a hundred one degrees officially, a hundred-twenty on the field. He was asked what he thought of the new British stadium. He replied, it holds the heat well. Not bad. Not bad, Casey. Right anyway. See, you would have enjoyed Casey Stangle, but then that was back in the day. As a, as a, what? Before, as a comedian, that's all the way. He was a funny guy. All right. I'll watch a show. A journey, Trister's Bush, Blananza, even more in green is embarrassed. I'm not going to read the whole thing as too long, but I give you like a little tease. The man who stopped the money, we can't make skinny millions. This is from the village voice. Roger Stole in the jury tricks half-gablet of Republican politics as exploited his Bush connections to become an influence-punnery force in a $13 billion Indian gaming industry. Stole's booming business in such a federally regulated enterprise makes his recent pro-blonor orchestration of Al Sharpen's double-ed presidential campaign and even stranger covert Capert. The long-time GOP consultants reward for fomending the Brooks Brothers mob at Chetown, the county recount in the 2000 election was an invention, an invitation within days of Bush's election to serve on the Department of Interior transition working group, helping his own words to staff its bureau of Indian affairs to be IA. Stole, in a sense, used as an announced purchase to market himself to trap his developers from Louisiana to California, earning fat-based and contingent percentages of future casino revenue just two of the five deals examined by the village voice I projected to pay him at least 8 million, perhaps as much as $13 million. Time, the Washington Post and the New York Times have published exposés about Bush's BIA with a February story highlighting $45 million in payments to 2 GOP lobbyists from Fort Trash since 2001, even D.F. faces turn and red. But no one has focused on stone's profiturion which unlike the payments to registered lobbyists did not report in any public filings, he has routinely brought in the casino deals in part because of his precedibility to win Bush and or Republican congressional support, a role in consistent with his financing and staffing of the Bush-Bashing Rearbunds campaign. But it was sharpened himself who focused the voices of attention on stones balancing indicating that business voters pushed on to take over the campaign. It's all about Indian gaming, he said, when pressed recently to a plain sharpened said I will not spell about it. Maybe because he can't spell it out who I'll know. In fact, stone is a history of bizarre political operations beginning with his watergate era infiltrationally, the government campaign, and sharpened as his own buckle background, beating up on Democrats to benefit behind the scenes GOP allies like D.M.A.R.O. George Fittack, he and Mike Bloomberg. I help sharpen because our like him says stone of Edwin of the Nixon Reagan dual and Bush campaigns who steer 220 grand the sharpens national election network last year. There's no connection between helping sharpened my business. Who would advise his stone scripting sharpened any damage the Reverend might do with Berners Stone's bonafideies with Bush, thereby bolstering his leverage for second-term gaming deals. Stone in Shrepton can see they still talk and stones ally Charles Halbin remains the manager of Shrepton suspended campaign, organizing fund raises to pay up a $634 debt. $134 grand of a due to five stone-tied aids. And the story goes on and on about stones multi-million dollar motivation. It's a long-served privilege for us to tell our subscribers it's disturbing. You see basically what we're dealing with is a bunch of quirks and new people out there have been brainwashed. I feel sorry for you because most of you, whether it's the religious brainwashed encrap or the political brainwashed encrap or both is the case in so many cases. And just can't see the fore enough, Jeff, the fore for the trees man, that's a problem. There are a bunch of crux. After reading that crap about Kerey again was really, I mean yeah, I'll vote from 10 or 20 times sure. He's the buffer. But he's weak, he's a lame ass is what he is. Bathers me badly. And I'm sitting there trying to think of a politician and don't tell me John McCann because what a sellout he is. I'm trying to think of a politician that I can really respect to, I think is honest. And I'm thinking well he killed a girl, you know. Teddy, Ted Kennedy. Right, love him. But he killed a woman. Right. And so now you understand, like, Bob, it looks so good, you know. So, okay, was it getting a few, well, we can't say the J's on the side, whatever was. Yeah, but he never killed nobody. Never killed nobody because presidents and senators don't have men killed Michael. Who's being naive now? QU, U, U, or C, U, K. Man. Very sad. You're all bunch of crooks. Oh, you're so cynical to him, I'm just some new way to his, okay? If you want to be star-eyed and believe all these people are altruistic and they have our best interest in heart, I'm going to look for you, okay? Line 9 is headed again, W.Q.M. hello. And you know what's going? Pretty good? Actually, I'll see you all for how about David Beckham. David Beckham, he's making a big bucks. Yeah, I mean he's a packer.

Very good. What do you know who that is? You're a sports nerd? Of course. Of course. Pretty boy, right? I would not say he's a pretty boy. Oh, my God. Oh, geez. J's. J's. Kordes just said that. That's what they, whoa. Man, your stocks just went down even the marketing full on that man. Although I ain't looking to good. That's because Alan Greenspan was on their own. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Interesting heights are in the future. We can't say it's a little matter of, you know, it's just a matter of time. You just wait and then all you, and that's another thing. Whether it's the religious BS, the political BS or the the investment BS. We're all about your suckers. We all get laid down the garden path. Pretty say. How's it going so far here? The most important, definitely, the the 20th century. 319 that's 20 almost 30 percent look at that. Not 30 minutes. No athletes are important.

You are correct. Absolutely, right? So I said, so in 96 years George, Facts is back again and we'll be more than glad Because I'm sure during that period of time Tom Brady We'll probably want several more Superballs Absolutely, right? How many? About 10 minutes! So at that point he'll qualify, no problem Some of these people, man, silly people Right in here, this from the Australian newspaper Proofing men males are a biological thrill Japanese and Korean scientists of Korean-made healthy mouse Board with no males genetic material at all Kind of like freaking Carlos, no males genetic material at all It's a process called Prarthetto Genesis And until now is never happened in mammals from mice to well men It says, in contrast many insects and reptiles Not to mention plants, take advantage of this all-girl form of reproduction Because mammals are inhibited from reproducing by Prarthetto Genesis We decided to study by sperm and eggs that require Formal development in mammals Team leader Tom Ahiro Konos said, from his office at the Tokyo University of Agriculture Professor Konos wrote discovered that the stumbling block was a phenomenon called genomic imprinting A process that turns off the domain or female version of a gene When eggs inspire me to produce an embryo It sounded esoteric but the finding in the sense The embryo was remarkable, so embryologists Patrick Tanos in the University and Westmeads children's medical research institute According to Professor Tan in Prarthetto, he is like the sun birth defects And that's another thing about your president by the way People with diabetes like me, people with all sorts of ailments People with spinal cord injury, like Christopher W. even 1000s and 1000 maybe millions of others They could be walking today, they could be healthy But we don't want that stem cell research because it's the village And it said, the pulper, I'll bend out a shape about it See, this is what keeps the world in the stonate This is what imposes and inflict so much misery on people Is the fact that religious crazy people are ruling the world And they have a sense of beginning of time Just about as you read your history and of course your just an expert on meaning of the story As you read it Oh look at this, this is really cute Another phony answer is What did you send that to me? I thought it was funny, it's cute, read it on here It's a... Side Michael Palo's cute Here you go, John, just funny Back Michael Palo probably likes this, so sure He likes our experiment, it's just that he has to follow the law That's all, he can't impose his own personal views Right Speak at a crazy religious people, the Bible College that leads to the White House From the independent UK and some of our website again I'll read just a short part of it I don't want to get too a newsy here Okay, get the one guy I'll bend out a shape I don't want to sit here and be too pedantic And read and read I mean like who am I reading this to? Who am I reading it to? The children The children, read to the children The campus is immaculate, everyone is clean-cutting Sure, full, but just what are they teaching at Patrick Henry College And why do so many of their students end up working for George W. Bush? It says it's worth making clear from the outset that Patrick Henry College in Roe Virginia is not your average American university At Patrick Henry the students about 75% of them been taught at home rather than schools Are required to sign a statement of faith before they arrive, confirming among other things That they have a literal belief in the teachings of the Bible, literal belief Oh my God At Patrick Henry students must obey a curfew, they must wear their hair neatly and rest modestly Can't like the Mormons I guess? Yeah Students must also obey real estate and then if they wish to hold hands with the member of the opposite sex They must do so while walking, standing while holding hands is not permitted Keep moving And at Patrick Henry students must sign an honorplied as it bends in from drinking alcohol Less under parental supervision So let me ask you something, if you're holding hands with the Saudi prince, can you be standing still? There we were moving, if you saw the tape they showed it, they were moving In fact, wish almost called down Maybe the prince was holding him up Yet these things alone did not make the college special error after all number of Christian establishments across the US And in force such a strict fundamental scope for their students No one makes Patrick Henry, and he is the increasingly closed critics say a alarmingly closed links This recently established right when Christian College has with the Bush administration and the Republican establishment is a whole School of the W Just like Bush This spring of the almost 100 interns working in the White House Seven are from Patrick Henry, another intern works for the Bush-Hain and we are less in campaign While another works for President Bush's senior political adviser Carl Raven Rove Yet another works for the Coalition for Regional Authority in Baghdad Over the past four years, 22 conservative members of Congress have employed one or more Patrick Henry interns Janet asked Crop to wife a Bush's Bible-thumping attorney, Jennifer was one of the colleges trustees And this is no coincidence Rather it is the very point students had planned for Henry are on a mission to change the world Indeed to lead the world When after four years or so a study they leave their neatly kept campus with its close-moan lawns They do so with a drive and commitment to reshape their new environments according to the fundamental right wing vision of their college Critics say Patrick Henry system cannot help but produce narrow-minded students with extremist views But the college has openly stated aim is to train young men and women who will lead our nation in shape our culture with timeless biblical values Oh my God Nancy Keenan of the Liberal campaign group people for the American what he says the number of interns from Patrick Henry going into the White House scares me to death she says People have a right to choose where their children are educated but work concerned that they are not exposed to the kind of diversity This country has your training people with a very limited ideological and political view if these young people are going into positions of power They have to govern with all people in mind just a limited number.

Suicide bombings in Vosera. 18 school children, little kids and a little school. I just wish you that in passing. See, it doesn't make any difference because television has so de-censitized the work in public that nothing goes on, whether it's column-bind, whether it's all of this massive. Notice now they got a new deal on CNN. They used to be Operation Iraqi Freedom. Now it's Mission Iraq. Whatever it had like me. I have no idea what it was. I mean, well we're out of business. To do what? Shut up. Anyway, in fact they just changed it. It was something else last hour now. Now it's Mission Iraq. They just keep changing it. John Nichols got a good column here in the nation as usual. Remember you wouldn't. Congresswoman Gerald the era Elizabeth the Holtman from New York. No, you're going to take Gerald the era. Now, why so we're all there both in New York so it's a Freudian sub anyway. Freudian timeframe. History used to provide the roadmap for the president. Unfortunately, leaders failed to consult the map. That's certainly been the case in the 911 Commissioners prepared to hear behind closed doors testimony from Vice President Dick Cheney and President George Bush at the same time. Members of the Commission for the most part members of Congress have attempted the secret testimony and accepted the secret testimony arrangement. But why? President's has testified before investigative authorities before and they have done so long comparable issues. Former U.S. representatives of Elizabeth Holtman reminds us that in 1974 a mid-national firestorm that followed President Gerald Ford's pardon the former President Nixon. Ford voluntarily appeared before a house somebody that was reviewing the pardon. The president came before the sub committee made an opening statement was questioned by the House members. Although each of us had only five minutes, I was able to ask the president directly whether it did been a deal with Nixon about the pardon. The public could determine by Ford's demeanor in his words whether to believe his impact in the island of any deal with Carl Soltman was the young member of the House was a key player and they do this year a committee's investigation in the Watergate scandal. The fact that important questions could be posed directly to the president and the fact that the president was willing to face down his various critics in public were healthy things for our country and not even the staunchest Republicans complained that the presidency was being demeaned. By recalling the history of Holtman Rises that President Bush could and should simply appear before the 911 Commission. There was no constitutional crisis here and there is no dangerous person that could be established and there is no question or proportionality. Certainly the intensity of the demands for explanation of the Nixon pardon can appropriately compete with those for an explanation of how the current administration was spotted to terrorist threats before and on and after the September 11th of 2000 attacks. As with the Nixon pardon, the events of 911 called huge national concern response, the victimist families as well as millions of others have asked why it happened and what if anything could have been done to a virtue tragedy, these are simple reasonable questions. The best response to those simple reasonable questions the whole of Holtman Rises would be for Bush to volunteer to testify in public and under oath to be national permission on terrorist attacks on the U.S. Bush would be wise to take a page out of Ford's book. Americans could then decide themselves whether to agree or disagree with Bush's 3911 Congress or not. They wanted trust their president. They wanted to know that he acted with the best of motives that he used good judgment that he's a leader. In other words, that a chief executive, he knows when and how to mobilize the government to take action Holtman asserted and an opinion T.C. wrote this week for New York State News. If Bush refuses to answer reasonable questions in public, the indelible impressions left at something to hide. That impressions being forced by the White House's insistence that Vice President Cheney's sit with Bush at the hearing. The president who cannot afford to convey the image that he's afraid to appear on his own, and needs of the 911 Commission or the published permit aid behind closed jurisdiction for anything except national security information. The same principle said replied to testimony of former President Bill Clinton. Holtman's wise comments, big one question. Why didn't anyone think to put this former member of Congress and even New Yorker on the 911 Commission? There are a number of information that is we share her experience including the course Richard Bevris State who hated Bush's department's Watergate Task Force 73-75. But we'll see that the Commission could use someone who recognizes the Holtman that there is no better, crucible in a public hearing who happened to be sure that the truth will come out. The idea could happen though. He's got to be holding Dick Sand. I said, he's got to be holding. Yeah. Just what I said. Kind of like Prince Abdullah, Dula, from Saudi Arabia. That picture is just a mind-blowing, especially when they showed it several times in Slummo and Free-Sherry-Mlyce, not innocent, you see. The most important athlete of the 20th century is or was, no athletes are important, 163 said that Jackie Robinson, 112, Miami, all these 76 V-25, Jesse Olin's 52, Michael Jordan 29, Dan Moreno's 17, Tiger Woods 12, Land Armstrong's 10, everybody else single digits. Even for George Armstrong's Chief. 560560, Con 560 on the AT&T in Verizon, Wireless Line. I just don't know what it takes anymore to get the American public pissed off. You are box cards. I'm not sure. What does it take? It's got to get me fired up when I hear someone say that. I mean, $2 a gallon gas. That doesn't seem to bother anybody, even though we were supposed to get, it was part of the deal. Going to get all this cheaper gas. We had that Iraqi oil, you know. Well, if they, of course, even though we weren't going to take over the oil fields, just for going in there, you see the whole of the oil's down to this. Back to the original, the first Gulf War 91. We didn't give a flying crap about two weight. That was the reason that we went in there. We went in there because our close dear personal friends and keep in mind who was president. That time, his life thing happened to be bush. Our good friends, the Saudis, were peeing in their pants. That once saw them finish off with Kuwait. He was going to go just keep marching right on his Saudi Arabia. Take over the oil fields and kick their Saudi ass out. That's why we went in there in 91 in the first place. I just, I just mentioned that in passing. Saudi Arabia, that is the sand, children of the wood pile. Okay, make no mistake about it. 560, 050, 050, 056, the only AT&T in Verizon, Marble Slime. W.M. Hello. Hello, the owner. Yes, sir. Are you going? Um, somebody, you know, personally, be tamper. There you go, why not? Okay, now I have two Q&A and Spire reports.

I heard it. Now he says that. He's in deep doodle man. He's in deep whatever we can't say anymore. Craft. Why didn't they dump it? Why isn't there a suspension? I have no idea what's going on with that crowd there. There's something really in a course robber creeper. He's like a alien mess. You know, he's the on touchable. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know what to make it pictures of. I think it might be a curse in Greg. And I mean, I mean, the duffer, the whole tree of Madrona. I don't know what it is. The whole man is the team in this square and pivot girl. But I mean, what is that all about? See, if they were wordless about eating all the free food from how he's doing in the morning, under the in these trying times that we're trying to survive through right now and more worried about monitoring very carefully what's on here. We wouldn't be having these things. I can understand the old mole man. Absolutely. This is silly old-footie. No, the anyway. Okay. Boy, how about Pete Rose? Somebody says that a posture or why not?

I'll tell the story. I'm going to make sure I get it all right. I. She was strangling if she could get her hands on him. Destroy this one's life. That's Pete Rose. And they are good. Should you be in the hall of fame? Let me answer you. Whether Pete Rose should be in the hall of fame. Who gives a flying crab? Okay. All the things they're going on in the world. All of these things they're in the world today. All of these things. And they were there. People out there worried about whether Pete Rose should be in the hall of fame or not? Screw him.

He's adding the meadow just taking his face that some boys who were down by the print. There being the water, there ends on their marbles and play things in and at last forth, their table, young ladies, she looked like a pretty young creature, she sat on the grass, she pulled up her dress and she showed them her ripples and laces and white luck beat dark. She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spin. While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling, wrapped you in later, but yesterday's art, for the girl in the meadow was rubbing her eyes at the pillow, down by the dark. In the black-up man with a size of more home in the country with a big fence out front, give me as her phone like they should show him her little pet dog who was subject to spit. And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender hands with her movement so quick. And then she bent over and sucked on his panties so tasty made of butter, sky. And then he spread with cream all over her cookies that she had left out on her shelf. If they just sit there, you can go through yourself. Come on, Tina, five, six, you're doubting QA. And here's one of those that we still play, how do you like that? Great. Like a lot. Anyway, I see it's your fault today, so you've done a band thing. Uh-oh. You haven't kept that leash short. You're leaving, let me go off to the Pentagon and give me all whipped up into a frenzy about all this crap. What? I'm loving it. Feat that sports business. You're a seeer, you're loving it because you're not the barometer of the audience. The audience out there wants a little bit of a few chuckles. See you like that. That sports. Forget about the sports part. But all this business about like changing the world and all been on a shape because all these leekers are liars and thieves and crooks and gypsies and tramps. So what am I going to do about it? Oh, you're not going to change the world, but it's fun to hear you're powered on the desk. Who else pounding on the desk? Oh, you know, it's a figure speech. I see. I said. Without the desk. That was the desk. Okay. Hey, if it wasn't, you probably heard one of those. Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Choices for the pull line, of course, any other fantastic information that you have to pass along. They got a call before. Well, this says about the pull. Can I discuss on their love course? Of course. But, you know, we never assume we're going to get those kind of calls because how many years have been doing this? Not good man. We're going to about that. That's why we started doing these simple and pulls every day because otherwise, if the audience doesn't have like a one-word response to give, it's, uh, oh, we're like we're including on their, uh, gray and their gray matter a little bit too much and a gay matter. Follow my drift. Don't you hear me? Hello, not there on line one. WQM, hello. How does this? Jesse, always make it on the list yet? Not having made it on there yet. We're working on it. WQM, hello. WQM, hello. Deal. Yes, sir. I got a name for your list of your female listeners from Road 4 and it's not John Holmes. How about Billy Bull guy Jean King? Billy King, somebody suggested that earlier. I'll tell you the same thing I said. Oh, no. Why would we put Billy Jean King on there? I don't know. But the most important aspect of the 20th century was Billy Jean. Okay, put around here. It'll make this guy happy. Billy Bull like Jean King matters to you. Put around here, Billy Jean, and then we'll have to put, uh, what's his name? Bobby Riggs. And Jack Riggs. And I'm just joking about that. I better say that because he put Bobby Riggs on there. I just know it. How about I had a quarter of COVID? Put Jack Riggs on there. Former voice of the hazel park. I think Jack Riggs retired or died one of the other. You know who Jack Riggs was? No. Good. mr слож p URL. Come at us. Jared fr Come look up our post onoo. Not too well. 560, put our old Tomaron Airport to Golden Bear Jack Nicklason and let's get a bunch of golf guys on here so this old tow that just got them in to go with a phony voice. Come on let's go. Let's put them on. 560, 560, pound 560. See you know what this really proves? How important sports really is. Yeah. It really does. I mean other than Joe Noondike and Eddie Belfort, who else do we need on this list? Am I right? Who? Who? And what about Gary Roberts? Who is that? Don't put him on there now. I have to clarify each and every one. And the audience is probably wondering why do you keep saying that because if I don't clarify it, he actually will go ahead and put it on or what does he know? Well you know who Gary Roberts is. Josh? No idea. Suddenly I have this pounding headache. Why should he do? I have this shrubbing pain in the what they call it, the makeup of my neck. What they call that? That is like you're on the stirms in the front. I want to call that. How about back go? And that's what they call. I got to paint in the ass. I don't want to go in with it. Okay. I mean we got, we got sports on this station and then they hear that guy tell me about what he's doing. Oh, how come I knew that? Not just a music he played there. Because he couldn't finish the two minutes without that crap. He haven't had lead. Couldn't, you've given away all the tickets that he had to give away. But a bunch of stupid, pretty equations. And he had nothing left for two minutes. So he plays music for two minutes. Is that brutal or what? That was our lead in. I don't want to play a bunch of boss again, Duff. I think you idiot. But if you ever put the big, oh again, there's a leaving this show, that little be it. At that point, at that point you and I, part company, we no longer will need our own program director on this show. If we have to be proceeded by the big, even if Duff had to do the show would have been more entertaining. Even if Freaky Carlos had to do the show, at least it would have been good for a few yucks. Yuck. Yeah, yuck. That's what I'm thinking. Every time I think of Freaky Carlos, that's the word that comes to my mind. Yuck. Yes. Staff. The big. Oh, man, he's brutal. But are your people? No, what are your people? What are your folks? When you're silly people? No, he's not one of my people. Is a sports guy. I'm not. Oh, sports is for idiots. WCOM. Hello. Yeah, I like speaking. Speaking. Neil, how you doing? Pretty good. Listen, I just want to think about talking here. You know, you think that we're at hold in your using.

To the most important athlete of the 20th century. Put him on or sure. What about what's his name? That loan the Louvre Gis Glove. What was his name, Josh? What's that? Wally Piff. He was the real Piff. Yeah. Louvre Gis is wally. Lomey or glove. And like 3100 games later, Wally still sitting on the bench cooling his heels. You just, you people don't know nothing about sports. So that's what I would love to expose on this radio station. It's supposed to be a sports station. Most of the people we got on here are sports pretenders. We got a couple of guys on you about his gambling. Okay. That's it. Gambling. And then we got a couple of guys that used to wear a drop strap and take showers together. And pretend to know something about sports. When a sports nerd when he sports star of the future sits there and tells me, he don't know who Gary Roberts is. I have to raise four eyebrows on that. And say, holy crap. Yeah. That's two sports star of the future who you talking about. Trots corners. He doesn't want to do those sports shows. Hell you don't. He don't. He better changes absolutely do about that. He'll see you how fast he'll be sitting out there in a street corner right there by Chuck Subcenter. What is some of?

She was a friend. She was the friend. With the same name as me. She was a friend. With the same Johnny G. And our day was going near. So are you doing? I'm making no big... Oh, you are. You have to put the depth on land. And to the rebellion hands. So you can only be one. I think if you all die, right? So they stopped into multi-slaps. I have a drink with pots. At the start was not what can't do now. But with creatures you've ever seen. You know, he has the flowers, all the flowers they've seen. You know, music and laughter that old Jedi members have the song. So tattooed, I saw more name with songs. I'm so he was a pilot. With the breath that it died. And his mouth will walk back wide there with two five-guys. He runs a little deep. They met with luchin' only one. About the millennium, funk and docking, they nightly. Just don't you, for that jerk, don't. With the flash of Ben's light. And he's a little bit odd. All the flowers, all the flowers can't be enough. So with creatures you've ever seen. You know, he has the flowers, all the flowers can't be enough. Music and laughter that old Jedi members have the song. I'm sorry, I'm stressed for a little time. The more I'm reaching I'm scum and to the man. The story is his name was Yoda. He was a muffin. He's a muffin. He's a muffin. He's a muffin. He's a muffin. He's a muffin. He's a muffin. He's a muffin. He's a muffin. He's an egg, a corn ball. He's a gully footballer. He's not a lousy day, both of them. That was for me. Jabban had bad eyes. He's open-wit. He's nails a bromac. Back on time, too. Wean had the flowers. I know what can't be done. So with creatures you've ever seen. You know, as a star was, all the flowers can't be done. Music and laughter that old Jedi members have the song. I can go back to the vehicle. I can't stop. Okay, that kills him so I'm thanks very much for requesting that that was very pleasant. I'm sure some of the curie people, who are new, will say now he's turning on John Kerry. I'm going to vote for him 50 times. Maybe at least not right. I'm just, he's very disappointing so far. Because under the present circumstances, even with these stupidity American public, I'm going to bring Washington to get from the news media, even with all of these things. He ought to be about 15, 20 points ahead, the very least, ought to be. You would think, especially with the body count rising your retainer, rack, and all the growth test things going on on a hand, and all these hearings going on all the, all you do understand that, Bush and Cheney are going to be testifying before 9, 11, and come in in the White House and not under growth together. Together, they're going to be holding hands. He doesn't have a lot, like Prince Abdullah. That's right. But they're going to not be testifying the growth. Now, of course, even if they raised their hands and put their hands on a Bible, they would still lie to their teeth. But now they can say, oh, well, we had to, we had to like heads to the truth because of national security, some crap like that, not under growth. I just mentioned it in passing. And there I go, as soon as I'm getting off the Yamgin off the top again, getting real with the Favotec grant. Nothing I can do about it. Other than vote a few times.

I'm a baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby Yes, I hope he brought you up, and I hope he surprises me, I hope he can bench him just really invigorate him and all the other stuff. By the way, you see the Heinz company, you know, his wife Teresa Teresa. His wife Teresa Heinz is, of course, the heir to the fortune, and the Heinz company is donating to Bush. I did better that. Well, now you know it. We're supporting the Bushmeister. But let's hope Kyrrkin catch up. That was bad. And anyway, I don't want to turn on Kyrrkin. But it's just the fact that he's so far, he's been, no matter what the issue is, whether it's Iraq, whether it's, you name it. Week, does the Israel thing? He's a Pandor. His wife is worth the all-ar, but I mean, he just, over the top. Let's bring back Howard Dean, okay? Almost forgive him and how he come on back. What do you say? Dr. Think? Can't wait. We're going to South Carolina and also home to... ...Ahhh, North Dakota. We're going to California and Texas, anywhere. We're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan. And then we're going to Washington and these theaters, they take the way down. Yeah! I see he was more animated than that one speech and he was trying to scream over the crowd as we know. But he was more animated than the one speech and Kyrrkin has been the whole time. He said real things. Right. Concreate that. He didn't just say the things that were politically correct all the time, which is the reason he ain't going to be the candidate. So, I have like stepped out of line, stepped on a lot of toes, said things that, and then the media kept saying, Well, gee, he really is going to be a lot of trouble for saying that. Why? Because it was the truth. Why, see? Just like when he captured Sodom and he said that we were no safer, I mean, that was he was right on man, is the britsay he was spot on, he had his thumb right on it. When he captured Sodom and tried to give us a big song to dance about, Oh, what, you know, we're fine. Right. Tell all the people who died since we captured Sodom. That's why they got to put on the kid. That's going to be the next headline on CNN, Teos in Iraq. And that's what it's going to be. I'm telling you, instead of Operation Iraqi Freedom or whatever was, and mission Iraq, next week it'll be a chaos in Iraq. Chaos out of a different world. Because this bows over God and there in his neocons, this is the God squad and the cons squad, which is the main difference between the Gus God and the Kwanakanskwar, all of those same people. Here's another nut case. Gun found in Congressman's carry on bag. A US Congressman was briefly detained in the Kentucky airport for two days after 30, saw the loaded gun in his bag. A screening checkboard, authority said. He said, but it's good enough. What's that was in any of the Oklahoma coach? Come on, how could I have a brain fart in that? To my help me out, Josh. What the sooner's coach? Yeah. Option. Who? Boxtooks? No, I'm not. Now I'm talking about the great all-time Oklahoma coach. I had the gun in his bag at the airport. Oh, my God. Does this child know anything? Wow. And the important things, not that. No, the important stuff is very, very slow to not. And I want you to embarrass you forgot that. Sorry. See, I haven't seen some of the dodging old fart, but you have no excuse. Sure he does. You've got a life. That's no excuse. I have no right. You know what it? Representative John Hustettler, we're public enough in Indiana. Completely forgotten, had to go to his bag, he preferred to take a US scareways like the Washington for the first day of work after two week recess. I guess he was never recessed in his head. A whole non-secured department official said, Hustettler had a loaded 9mm block pistol in his bag at Louisville in an Azure Airport. The Congressman said he didn't know the gun was in the bag and a followed guide. Well, that's okay as long as he follows the eyes, right? Just like Arnold's followed the eyes all those bras that he groved. The group and either. Oh, or he, if he gets selected, he's going to look into it. And again, the media puts that on the ear like it's a legitimate answer to a question, okay? Well, I'm not going to get bogged out with that now. I have to worry about the election, but if I'm elected after the election, I'll look into all of those things. And then the election came and he wins an landslide and did you look into it? Oh, forget about it as what he said. How do you like that? After all about he says, but got about it. Yeah. Ever see him in motorgivin? Yep. 560, 5056. He's the terminal. He's the terminal. He's the terminal. He's the terminal. He's the terminal. In fact, speaking of being terminated, that thing we heard about this morning that we were, we didn't sound a good. We got a zero tolerance policy mode. A zero tolerance. That means you get a few slip ups saying, no scrufs. I'd like to know what the Robert and Zach are doing in there together, why all the stuff is going on now. I'd like to know what that always do. He says eating free food. WDQA and hello. Pretty great.

You know what I was doing? You know what I was doing? Right. Tondrous. Anyway, 27-2-5 60-WQM, TV never school on passion, and they'd better cool off that passion, they're going to get what for for Michael Powell. Despite being the year's biggest boss-orifice blockbuster so far, the passion of the Christ seems unlikely to find a home on the four biggest broadcast networks. No, Gibson's eye-to-eye productions has been shopping the movie to TV. Only ABC is confirmed turning it down, but as I can speak on condition of anonymity as they as they always do, said it was downfall, for CBS NBC and Fox 2. The movie's graphics scenes of Jesus Christ's crucifixion were said to make broadcast through a skittish, especially in the wake of the Janet Jackson business when government officials are closely watching what goes on TV on the tube, but closely watching your tube. There might be a lot of baggage because of the violence said Brad Edgate, endlessly Edgate by former Horizon Media, what a great name that is Edgate. That like Watergate, is that what we have on this radio station, Edgate? Edgate? That can put some fresh run advertising not to buy this, he said. Fox is the way you invite a way to send this broadcast to the department before making an assistant, whether it pursue an airing at the University of Tennessee. The Hollywood News offering, a licensing deal, never somebody have of Icon Jeff Bird, would not Jeff Bird, oh my god, would not come on any negotiations. Jeff Bird, a what if his name was Birdstein or whatever was. You believe that? I believe it. He's just a businessman trying to make a living. But it says it could be a cable could be where it's going to mind a phone. But they better hurry up. Before cold and towel in his buddies, Edgate Michael Powell, you're a hold of the cable thing too. Because he said it again, if Edgate was yesterday morning, I forgot to mention that. That's what they really would like. Cable satellite, books, newspapers, magazines, private conversations, right. Telephone conversations, all of these things. All of these things. Besides the film's violent content, a TV network that airs the passion would also inherit controversy about it, some Jewish organizations have directed the movie for Fearwood Cause. Bad blood. Here's the greatest line in the history of the human race. For Fearwood Cause, bad blood between Christians and Jews. That's, that isn't a warman. Oh, God. We sure wouldn't want that. Bad blood between Christians and Jews. Is that can't ever happen? Got along for so long. Never be let's say the bad blood between Jews and the Palestinians. The Hindus and the Muslims. Bad blood. By the own blood. Remember that? Was that by Neil Sedakah? Neil Sedakah. Sorry. He wrote it. 560, 1050, 5060, on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless 5. Guess we're done with a list as far as any more names on him. What? I mean, I guess we are. Well, I mean, we're open for any more, but I think we've got the important people on their dough. That's all. Although then, well, I'm trying to think of some of Mayor of Laftad. Drake for our housekeeper. How about Jesse Owen? Now there's something to think about. Put him on there. And what about Alexey Panaquerowski? We might think about putting him on there too. But I had a quarter COVID. WQAM Hello. QAM. Oh, I like the sound of that though. Not a good sound. Hmm, it's a beauty. WQAM Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I read in sports show, sir, that your boy Tommy Brady was over the Vatican getting plastered by the Pope. Oh, my God. I wonder why the Pope kiss him? Oh, I bet his mighter got a little tighter when that started happening. But anyway, moving along. Yeah. I heard a rumor that the elf friend can show they were going to try to punch it up by getting someone in there, you know, that he could verbally start with like, canity and comb kind of. Oh, boy. Well, I'm going to nominee Ben Stein because then the show would be Frankenstein. Oh, hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not bad. Not bad. Good luck, your pal. You'll need it. I like that. Al Franken. Oh, God. What a bad mistake. I did not want you a long time ago. Yeah, you did. Did I say that's never going to fly. You wore this. But they wouldn't listen to me. And of course, normal. She's too busy normally. You weren't about to sag away to worry about, you know, taking care of his clients. Getting my like 600 video stations. If you saw a fool's wouldn't have had a fever in his heart. I could have been a contender man. Could have been bigger than Murray Tyler Moore. Bigger than certainly. Forget about normally. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Baseball cards and factory. That's it. That's the man's life. I have no life. WQAM. Hello. Yeah. I have a. A four figure for the 20th century. All right. I thought I didn't mention that you're obviously. Jackie Robinson that's a good one. I think of all the pulls we've ever done. It's a good sign. It's a good sign. It's a good sign. It's a good thing. It's like it is. Because what it says is there's a very limited number of these people in the whole hundred years who really have an estimate of even think about putting on this list. I mean we did the entertainers yesterday. What do we do the day before that? The world leaders. whatever we did. And I thought, well, why not do the Appalachian, which was one way of keeping them off the other two lists, but I think well, I gotta be something. And after we don't have any votes, we got, look at how many votes we got. 840, we're doing about like about 900 votes during the show. That's not too bad, right? We'll take it. Well, especially considering where we are, see, I want to say this to you, and I really mean this. One of the things that our website has taught me is that a lot of the impressions that I had in the past were, they were correct, but they were understated, right? Remember, I used to bitch every year about the worst week of the year for doing the show was the Easter and, uh, pace off the Passover business. Right. And I was right, but little that I realized that the demarcation line, it comes in phases. But phase one is positively that week. That's when everybody starts feeling on this town. And then you get the week after that. So everybody who, uh, hung around for a week for whatever reason, then they start feeling on it. And of course, it raises the question, my mind, what happens when we get to like what when a kids are all out of school like Julian Joolie, when George is going to be on their turning over an empty microphone, July and August most of the days, what happens then, yeah. Why? I don't want to get you any pressure. I don't know what I'm saying. It's, huh? Whatever. I'm used to it. But it's just that you see nobody there. No, we'll have a job share to talk to it. When it's super hot and super humid and super bowl, it's long past, even Janet Jackson's boobies, it's similar to the ancient past. Oh, pretty, back up. Top it back up one more time. Oh, don't let Michael see it. We'll talk about the other one. Michael Jackson that is, first you've got to move on that with he hates boobies. 20 till 25 60, 72 and the man who loves the big ones, Jim Man, he should be along it too. The Humper Hank Goldberg at four. He's seen one or two in his town. The Marlin pre-game at six 30 Marlins at the Feliz 705, 80 K to follow that. And then overnight. And then of course it'll be interesting in the morning if what that color said is true, either I don't know. You don't mean a very dubious about anything the color say about most of the, one of those this morning. Wow, to be man, oh man, because it's zero. I hear it's zero tolerance. I hear that they are dead serious on this and that if anybody should, any of the people on here, especially go over the line and really just let something just wouldn't doubt word it out. I'm listening. History. In his case, ancient history. You heard about the big demand of the high pay potential for computer professionals. Have you ever wanted to square might be okay for you?
