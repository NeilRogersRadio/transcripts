And since it was in his last place too when nearly 1400 votes on stupid religion which is certainly redundant. No question about that. Because people generally are wicked.

And she speaks like a real person but then again when you see all in a family. Almost everybody with all in the family thinks of a curler kind of artie and she's a good girl. But her acting in that show is just fantastic. And poet. She was what was all about right it. Okay. How do you mean to say eat it anymore? I'm sorry. I apologize for you. Gene Stapleton. You got a choice? Underrated actress? I'm not thinking about it a couple of good words but I want to think of it. Okay. Ponder it. So we'll get some more from the audience for that.

I just discovered about Zach. He has one talent. It's called eating. That's it.

Man, don't be bugging me. I'm eating over here. He just carted those up and Josh was playing those. Right. What a joke. We got to go to something. Yeah, that's right. He's good at it, man. He can clean the plate, clean the table. I'll be watching the dude here at him. Anybody drops a few crumbs on the floor. He'll clean that up for you too, man. He'll look it right up.

We're going to do this very brief next couple of hours that we got four to the wait time is slipping away already. And that bad. Oh, right. Oh, man. Love me short shows. Present and George W. D. Votious taking powerful anti-depressant drugs to control his erratic behavior, depression and paranoia. Capital Hill Blue has learned. This is a great website, Capital Hill Blue. And they're not like liberal and I've conservative. They're like right down in the middle. But they rip everybody who deserves it, which is a lot of people. The prescription drugs administered by Colonel Richard J. Tubb, the White House physician, can impair the president's mental faculties and be crease both his physical capabilities and his ability to respond to a crisis administration aids admit privately. His mental faculty is limited as they already are. It's a double aid source says one aid. We can't even fly off the handle at this size provocation. We also need a person who is alert mentally. Tubb prescribed the anti-depressants after a clearly upset bush. Stormdob stage angel, I, a three-fusing to answer report is questioned about his relationship with undiated and run executive Kenny Lay. Keep those mother efforts away from me. He screamed in an aid batch stage. If you can't, I'll find someone who can. How do you like that? Now how come the mainstream media has been reporting this? So come way after read about this in Capital Hill Blue, which is on our website. Now seriously, how come the mainstream media has been reporting this? How come both blitzquake is not there shouting this from the rooftops? And Dan Radar and Tom Brokeh, but his bad freaking speech defect, huh? I mean we saw the video clip of him storming off the stage and that's the end of it. That's all you hear because it's bad for business. It's bad for the bush mice to win for our Nazi leaders. Keep those mother efforts away from me. He screamed if you can't, I'll find someone who can. Bush's mental stability has become the topic of Washington, Whispers, and Recent Months, Capital Hill Blue first reported on the 4th of June 4th about increasing Concern among White House Aids over the president's wide mood swings and Upseen Outbursts. This is the man who was going to bring morality and decency back to Washington and his vice president's drop in F bombs in Congress and the Senate and this mother is dropping mother efforts towards all over the place. Upseen Outbursts, how do you like that? David. Although GOP loyalist dismissed to be purchased anti-Bush propaganda, the reports were later confirmed by prominent George Washington University's psychiatrist, Dr. Justin Frank, in his book Bush on the couch inside the mind of the president. Dr. Frank diagnosed the president as a paranoid, megalomaniac and untreated alcoholic whose lifelong streak of Satan's emerging from childhood pranks, like using firecrackers to explode frogs to insult and journalists glowing over state executions and pumping his hand briefly before the bombing of Baghdad showcased Bush's instability, in other words he's, are waving lunatic. I just mentioned this if you think about voting this year. I was really very unsettled by him and I started watching everything he didn't reading what he wrote and watching him on videotape. I felt he was disturbed, Dr. Frank said he fits the profile of a former drinker whose alcoholism has been arrested but not treated. Dr. Frank's conclusion has been praised by other prominent psychiatrist including Dr. James Grotsstein, Professor at UCLA Medical Center and Dr. Irvin Yalom, Chalom Yalom, MD Professor Meredith Steadford University Medical School sounds a couple of year laughs to me. Dr. Frank is also worried about the wisdom of giving powerful anti-depressant drug through a person with the history of chemical dependency. You follow me miss? Yep. Bush is an admitted alcoholic although he never saw treatment in a formal program and stories about his cocaine uses a younger man stories about his cocaine use as the younger man haunted his campaigns for Texas Governor in his first campaign for president. President Bush is an untreated alcoholic with paranoid and megallamaniac tendencies Dr. Frank gets. The White House did not return phone calls seeking comment on this article. Although the exact drugs Bush takes to control his depression behavior or not know why House sources say they are powerful medications designed to bring his erratic actions under control. Occurrental top regularly releases a synopsis of the president's annual physical details of the president's self and age drugs between the numeracy are not public record or are guarded veilously by the secret of cadre of AIDS that surround ill president. Veteran White House Watcher say he built a control information about Bush's health. Either physical or mental is similar to Ronald Reagan's second term when AIDS managed to conceal the president's increasing memory lapses that signal the onslaught of Alzheimer's disease. It also brings back memories of Richard Nixon's final days when the as soon to resign president wandered the halls and talked to portraits of former president's the stories that the merchant till after Nixon left orifice. One long time GOP can something who for obvious reasons has not to be identified cities advising his Republican congressional candidates to keep their distance from Bush. We have to face the real pot. Oh, this is this is the best paragraph I've ever read on the year. Okay, I want you to open up all right years. Open up every echo more fishing your body right now.

adventure for time, one sunny day So we're arriving, if we don't mind our fare So, what's that? 1047 at 560 WQ and happy Thursday. It's good. And we got every crazy person in the university's will this day, which is sensation. We have to face the very real possibility that the president of the United States has looting tunes. He said sadly, this long time Republican political consultant, that's not good for my candidates. It's not good for the party, it's certainly not good for the country's way said. I just thought I mentioned it again, like on every break. Of course, some of us are totally surprised by that. Somebody says, Linda Blair, which is interesting, because we were just listening. I was watching her this morning on screen TV without being a father. It's just one, two, three. I corrected their spelling for the poll. Okay, Linda Blair, it's just guilty qualified for your poll. Okay, I'll change my vote if you don't. Okay, I'll leave it on the right. Okay, you don't have the right parts. That's what an effort motels me. Anyway, Homeland Security authorities, he's shocked down the port of Palm Beach and evacuated surrounded neighborhoods yesterday after police stopped two men of middle eastern descent who were driving from the sea port authorities said. I swear by current is what I'm hearing. My Kim Curry. FBI agents question the men that released him because they've been this identified and done absolutely nothing wrong in agency spokesman said, but of course we always are wondering, are you sure? We hope at the end of the day this will turn out to be just a very good exercise. Review of each mayor, Michael Brown, be saying. The incident started about 3 30 yesterday afternoon. I remember here a peach police pulled over a car speeding in the 1700 block of old Xie Highway. The car carried three men to a middle eastern descent police said, middle eastern area. Oh my God. Police ran a background check in the Arabic name of the driver popped up on a terrorist watch list it popped up. As a person of interest by law enforcement police spokesman Roseanne Brown said, question further the men of purity, face of and change their answers to the same question that just raised a lot of suspicions, mental police. They have left three containers at the port considered one of the company's biggest terrorist targets along with the next door FPNL generating station. That's when the US Coast Guard closed down the port. The government stations broken after the talk show is to invoke the T word. The terrorist returned to the same county, traversed by 12 of the 90 men involved in the nine-level text. Apparently the answer is, no, apparently not. By 5 PM, law enforcement officials announced that the men in question was not the first on the terrorist list. By 615 they reopened the port. The men were US citizens of Jordanian descent who were shipping furniture by both of the US Virgin Islands. How do you like that? The FBI would not release their identities because they didn't do nothing wrong and they don't want to have like a whole bunch of you folks out there. Stationed down just because they happen to be from Jordan and a bunch of brown-skinned Arabs, right? Right. So leave them alone. Where are they? For the time being. Mother of the terrorists somewhere in Jupiter. 560, pound, five 60, pound, five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

Yeah, it's already, that was all in the family. And I think also, Grovid Al was related to her as well, and Al was a little more aristocrats from the Wiemann. Two in a slot. We have to face the very real possibility that the President of the United States is looming to and since there's a long time to do a people political consultant who probably is reasons as not to be identified. That's not good for my candidates, it's not good for the party and certainly not good for the country. In other words, and they're given them all kinds of medication, no, it's right at the commas, as down. During the break there, I heard my cell phone bringing another room, I thought, who would it call me? And I go in there and look at the number, it's an 800 number. Dear, how about that? So listen to this calling on my freaking cell phone, which I very rarely use. How do you like them, apples? I think it's everywhere, come on and go on. Gene Stapled in God 67, nobody's going to catch eat it. Francis McDormand 27, the most underrated actress movie or TV of all time, Helen Mirren 16, Natalie Portman 10, Joe Bladell 8, Emma Thompson 6, Tallya Sharers, God 7, Jennifer Tilley's, God 7, Linda Bladell's, God 5, Joe Allen 4, Jennifer Jason Lee 4, then Hamilton 3, Amanda Pummer 2, Penelope and Miller 2, Ellen Verstins only got one, Scarlet Johnson, when I Louise, what you don't have any, all my God. That is scandalous, don't you think it is? They probably don't know who that is. They don't. Well, why not? They're stupid. Oh, I see. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line, lost record of vote in O.T. Florida Race Concerns O.F. or races of concern. I'm sure you talked about this. Oh yeah, at least. Almost all electronic records from the first widespread use of touchscreen voting in Dave County have been lost, stoking concerns, that the machines are unreliable as the presidential election draws near. The records disappeared after two computer system crashes last year, County of Lexington's official said, leaving no audit trail for the 2002 Golden Aterrail primary. A citizen's group on covered law theory of the swath after requesting all audit data from that election. A county official said a new backup system would prevent electronic voting data from being lost in the future, but members of the citizens group, my many dead election reform coalition said that now function underscore the vulnerability of electronic voting records and wiped out data that might have shed light on what problems the country still existed with touchscreen machines in Dave County. The groups of plot results have been requested that you are times. This shows that unless we do something now or maybe maybe very well be too late, Florida said it to her being the next Florida. Kind of worded the well. Other words, I said, leader Rodriguez Tassaf and attorney was chairwoman of the coalition. Florida said it to her being the next Florida. All right, he didn't say very well. I was going to be the same crap we had for hours ago. I thought he was viewed in 2000 presidential election. Anyway, Michael Morris says he's going to be scrutinizing Florida. Let's see. He's coming on down. In fact, you better watch it, Jack, because if you I would stock up on my crispy creams right now, there's once Michael Norgets in town, I won't be any less over for you. I guarantee that he sell them to a big afford. You can bet your fan ass on that. Fair and height 9, let them tell make her Michael more promising. Yesterday, the train, his cameras on Florida come election day to prevent a repeat of what some Democrats call the stolen election of 2000. I am committed. I'm coming to Florida more. I said to allow chairs from Democrats that they Florida delegation breakfast in Boston. Together we will guarantee that every floor of the city in that their vote will be counted this year. Morris promised comes amid milding criticism and concerns about the accuracy of the touchscreen voting machines. That replaced Florida's punch car ballots and questioned about Florida's ability to hold fair elections four years after the debacle of 2000. In Boston, Democrats will stay at the living of complaints about Florida's election system this year, ranging from criticism of the state's creation of a new possible fell on voter list that contained inaccuracies to concerns about electronic voting machines that do not have paper trails that can be manually recounted to allegations of voter intimidation in 2000. In Dave County, County officials confirmed a report in the New York Times yesterday that the electronic records of the Democratic Governor-Turro primary between January and November, and have been largely lost because of 2003, compared to a higher-compareding cracker like a decision. And until a handshake governor, a jab voice-tube notice and a sign is on presser consecutive secretary to handle the criticism, state election officials are heading to date to investigate. Right. He wants to investigate, like setting the Fox to check into the Fed ass governor of yours who, how anybody could have voted for an act of just boggles of mind. How is that possible that anybody could have been so stupid? Now, if you know this, since you don't know who he is even, but we didn't have one call about Barack Obama, right. Who will be president one day? I'm telling you that right now, or at least vice president, for start. His speech on Tuesday night was sent, stationally, was great, what should I say?

Oh, and by the way, speaking of actors and actresses, actor Anthony Anderson, you know who that is? No. Oh, he appeared in films. Me myself and Irene and Barbara Chop black dude. Okay. All right. Yeah, no. He was charged yesterday with aggravated rape. After a woman told authorities, she was assaulted on the set of a movie. Anderson 33 and Wayne with her school in 42 both of LA, were taken into custody to the internet to the woman reported the assault. Said Steve Schuyer, the relation to the former dolphin coach, Shelby County Sheriff's Department of Public Affairs Officer Anderson was in Memphis shooting a film titled Hustle and Flow. With this film's crew, Chargeny and her father against both men, he has to be in the afternoon. Schuyer said bond was effective. He said it's 20 grand for each man. He'll be right in general. Says in court this morning, quite a Jennifer Donalds, communicating director for the Shelby County VA's office. Schuyer said the crew had been shooting at the Shelby County Correctional Center, a work farm for jail inmates, and the assault allegedly occurred at the state at the site after production in two days. Schuyer said a nice to trolled up in these that she was lured into a production trailer by Widdyspoon. He told authorities that Anderson was already in the trailer, and that both men sexually assaulted her Schuyer said. Widdness is reported seeing the woman leave the trailer screaming and without any clothes on. screaming. Time like that. Hacking guy. Did that be any driver's enough? Yeah. Why don't I do that? I don't know. I like that. I just thought like it. What's his name? Jeffrey Hacking. Michael Hacking. O.J. Hacking. The woman was taken to hospital authorities. We're not saying she had been released. Spoken from Granderson, L.A. released a brief statement when they sang the actor absolutely nized the heinous heinous charges that made against him. He's a hapling-grade family man. He's never been accused of such crap. In addition to 19 movie critics, Anderson co-created and starred in a TV sitcom all about the Anderson's on the WWE channel. Got the idea. There you go. Another famous actor in trouble. No unusual? Oh yeah, they're out of this. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Things are sitting up just fantastic for this afternoon's volume. See, at Carerson they're getting all all bent out of shape. Always raining and I think we may have a, you don't have to do an extra hour and a half. No chance sweetheart. No chance. But as much as I do in that today is so you didn't laid some time this year. I'm Josh Pekkin. WQM. Hello. Hi. Dr. Neil. Speaking. So I'm Neil. Yes sir. Just called to confirm that yes indeed I run no long visit the Atlantic. Oh no are you kidding me? About 45 days ago. I'll be damned. I haven't found that worries moved on to. But second thing I wanted to dash is you seem Fahrenheit 9, 7, 9, 9. Yes, sir. Why is it that there were no senators that showed up to sign all these people's petitions? You mean including John Edwards and John Kerry? Yeah. And Nelson and everybody else. I mean at any Senator could assign that right? Yeah. I guess one. No boss man. No boss. Not Larry. Larry's self. Right. Unbelievable. You got a new year. That's yours man. And when I, and I, I'll let you know. You have a big kiss for our Staxelot Valley. Where was Bill Nelson where was Bobby Graham? That's it. It's kind of the same philosophy now you know the Democratic Party decide well we don't want to continue doing this and for the good of the country we'll just let it go and right. Of course there was gore himself standing up there presiding over the session. Did that not make you want to cry? It made you want to screw not cry. Maybe want to scream. What is wrong with you man? And he's gathering in the shouting them down and shutting them up instead of in someone. While they're trying to do like a real pubic servant say hey this. This was a fraud baby. Democrats. That's a problem. I mean you want if you're a, you know, to the left of Hitler, then you certainly are probably going to vote for Kerry or at least to hope that he wins. But the fact that a matter is that if I'm a credit party for all the hoopla this week of the convention is so weak need and yell a yellow belly that live or live or do all these other things. Which is why they're trying. We don't want to make any personal attacks. We don't want to be a shrill and so why not? Every this minute time and history of this country where we got this rampant fascism going on where we have an illegal war based on a pack of lies that there's no question about. Then it's right now. And instead well we want to rise above that and provide a positive message. Which was right and which was on their last night and for all the hoopla about it. I didn't hear anything new. I didn't hear anything really strong. I just, you know, he looks fine. You know, he looks like a guy. As a canned spam speed. Looks like a 51 year old guy who looks about 40. Okay, more power to a misrespected one is wife was about 51 looking 80 when she comes on here with her to resahines hairdo. And I do think that Theresa May have been heavily medicated when she made her speech on Tuesday night. That's the rumor. That hair man has just got it on course when he was a billion dollars. Right. She said she looked her hair ain't quite as good as what's on it was wife. I don't know. I don't know. Bill. Yeah. Bill is bills but she's trying to catch up as what she said. There was a man. How come they make the Heinz Cage of Nouners upside down bottles? How many years they've been doing that? Not sure the man. That's the greatest idea since sliced bread. Yeah. Then we could buy all's upside down. We're at least with the variable. Don't get that watery stuff. At the top. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. Can we catch a B1 and a Y? Catchups for Goil? No. It's loaded with. Oh, carbs. Sugar. Yeah. That's a carbs. It's loaded with sugar. In fact, if you look on the label on Heinz Cage for a hunts or any of the other ones, you'll find the lots of azukar in there. But I don't eat sugar anymore. No more. I just mentioned that. I want you to jack up. I'll eat sugar at all. I love sugar. I'm fine. You're going to die. I will bring a couple of bottles. I'll say, and who's a pretty good guy. I have much to say. And he couldn't speak because his. See your vocal cords are being the reason you have such trouble speaking. It's because your vocal cords are being choked by a sea of fat inside your throat. We'll get a nice bouquet of doughnuts for his calm. Yeah, that would be good. We'll get a crispy cream bouquet to stick right on your tombstone. How's that? I like it. I like it. Watch your back, Zach. I want to tell you that right now. Absolutely. 560, 750, 50, 60. Pound 560 on it. Is anybody going to talk about baroque Obama? Man. I saw Cartillion where was that? I guess it was in the National Post here this morning. They showed a picture of the TV was on. There was Obama speaking at the convention here tonight. And one of the president's aids is saying to him, Oh, it looks like they finally found Obama. Oh, you had to think about it over the way about it. Yeah. Well, what do you know Obama from more son? From Abu Garza. Right now, either. Come to QA and hello. Hey, how are you doing? Pretty good, pal. I'm not sure you got many moves to go. When I was a good looking guy. Man, it's a job, Georgia's age. Back in the collection, Chevrolet. You bought a core of that for a month. Okay, great. Just call it a lecture. You know, one thing that's on my mind. I was in my love house last night. I watched it as far as TV. And I got all these mayoral candidates throughout there. And my god, what up? Jack and cards. We got the shoes from here, Miami. All right. But I want to borrow. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I want to hear views on that. I'll hang up. See what you think about that. Okay. Now, I don't five, six, seven, five, six, six. I couldn't even. But Tom five, six, three on the AT&T in Verizon. Well, Carlos Scott, I think that got lined with date. Yeah. Well, what was that all about him? He told me a card collection, the collection or whatever a core vent. I don't think I ever bought a core vent at the collection. Now, what he said? What do you say? I'm sure we do. Whatever. What ever he said? I got a tune about when you're being picked up. I see. And excuse-fouting bushes busted by the 911 reports is Robert Cheers. time to read this whole thing that now I know.

I've been telling you about a laser recharge, the toner, recharge, cartridge specialist for the past few weeks. A lot of you call 1-800. Oh, and by the way, before I do this spot. Oh, yes, you did it again. If you have something to do, you can leave now because in the noon to 12 30, are we have nothing but spots? We got three breaks to throw again. Proving beyond a shadow of a doubt. All we want is the money. Maybe we're still number one. They still have a so much they can't turn it off. We got spots up the old uh... Recto mass. I haven't heard about a laser recharge. The toner, we turned cartridge specialist to the past few weeks. I'm sure a lot of you have called 1-800-2-8-7-9212 which we're glad to hear. And you save a lot of money on your printing and office equipment supplies. For those of you who haven't called yet, what are you waiting for? A laser recharge is about injects, thermal carbon paper supplies. They provide service support and maintenance for most makes and models of machines to make them run just like brand new again. When you call 1-800-2-8-792-12, you'll talk to just Bob the solar and earth vince of plan, but this isn't so float or what they need. In most cases within 24 hours. A laser recharge can save you up to 50% on new cartridges as compared to depot pricing. And I want you to keep in mind that all the cartridges sold by a laser recharge are re-manufactured not refill. Just about anybody can sell your cheap refill cartridge but you only get what you pay for. Re-manufactured cartridges are the only smart way to go and a laser carries a complete lot of cartridges for printers, copiers and faxes, along with brothers and girrox drums too.
