Maybe that's why he's leading our pull out of the first 76 votes He's got 46 you think that might be part of it. I got 53 for him. I just refreshed like I said it just went to 53 out of the first 86 Michael Jackson's got 11 I got a really a blockbuster store and I go I didn't say blockbuster Sorry, I apologize a gangbuster president Bush's public support dropped sharply over the past month All right, especially among older voters who are the ones who happen to vote by the way political independence and people in the Midwest and AP poll found And for the first time more voters in this polls two years of tracking the question said they would definitely vote against Bush and said they would definitely vote for him Bush is approval rating stood at just 47% of the AP if so's poll taken early February down from 56% approval just a month ago half or 50% said they disapproved in latest poll Bush is 47% approval rating is exactly the same as his fathers at this stage in his presidency 12 years ago before he got pummeled by Bill Clinton in 1999 Just under 4 and 10 37% said they would definitely vote to be elected Bush's president while 43% said they would definitely vote for somebody else According to the poll connected by by AP another 18% said they're considering for somebody else Haha, oh, not looking too good W so he'll be I meet depressed this Sunday and Tim Russell throw them softball the old Mr president Mr president all the sudden crap you just know that Yeah, I think you said are right he's gonna fill up by the president back to with honey and just suck it out with a straw so get the honey Tim Yeah, he's just gonna want move on that org is got another interesting thing here disturbing interesting they do a good job. Yes, they do says we didn't think the hypocrisy at CBS headquarters could get any worse, but it just did As you know CBS refused to run move on voter funds child's pay add perhaps the most tasteful and unconversial advocacy had in history during the Super Bowl CBS executives claim they had a blanket policy against so-called issue ads Yesterday we learned that the network plans to broadcast an ad promoting the Bush Medicare prescription drug law This is part of a $13 million taxpayer finance TV campaign to take the heat off the White House for pushing through a drug plan that benefits drug companies and insurance companies more than Medicare recipients The White House had features the tagline same Medicare more benefits, but a report by consumers union last month said that most people covered by Medicare wind up spending more for prescription drugs As we as all of the provisions in the law which favored drug companies According to the Washington Post to campaign is intended to counteract democratic criticism that Charge changes to the Medicare program will harm older Americans Now that is in the controversial issue, why don't know what is but since CBS appears to be changing its policy our voter fund is submitted our own Medicare Which exposes the facts behind the spin campaign to run on CBS so far we haven't heard back Please give CBS a call today. Let them know they need to either pull the White House add or run hours And it's got the Viacom CBS's number their email their shoe size their whatever the else so I call that number and that's same email mail boxes full well good Keep calling it okay 212258 6000 for Viacom the C.P.

He's just to make it a lot of noise. Oh you people were gonna come after you. Yeah Oh, this is good And took almost three days, but the first lawsuit has been filed a connection with Janet Jackson's breast bearing is in during the Super Bowl halftime show that he liked that Oh, yeah, got the right poked out TV watch you Terry Carl and wants to make a federal case out of Miss Jackson's bare breast.

Tonya their sharp and point me like brain damage which according to the one I'm reading here. It doesn't sound like she's got the equipment for that But Miss Carl and who works in a bank a lot of explains a lot. Yeah, doesn't specify the type of injury allegedly suffered The lawsuit sees billions of dollars in compensator and punitive damages mean while CBS already facing an FCC probe for the halftime show said it would grow While we already know that the five minutes away in the Grammys Oh, and listen to this Access Hollywood as we can say yesterday reported Miss Jackson been uninvited into the Grammys on Sunday, but it remained unclear as of now Whether she actually would appear or not, maybe she's just gonna like sneak up from behind just in like whipping right out Oh, but we got a five minute delay so only the live audience and whatever that wherever they're doing it.

All the Janet Jackson stuff for the couple of days of leave. Reverend Jones, might not have been, but I think it was. You think? Close it up. You were close enough to it. I'm yet like you now. If it even sounds just a little teeny tiny, but you're going. Sorry about that. Not just the way it goes. And if it's make and lady don't like it. Blow it out your ass on hand. Call up tough and complain that him. We hate you. You're a crazy person lady. What the? Hey, how you doing? Pretty good sir. Speaking. Listen, understand about Janet Jackson, but I want five minutes alone. It's got to Sarah Sodom man. That's ridiculous. I just want him. I want to do something. And you know he's going to have a defensive journey. There's a long ponderous trowel he's going to have all sorts of song and a dance in his story. They should just kill him right now, right on TV. Right now. Right. I will be more in the happy to help. I'll be right there to have a happy out. I'll hop on the first plane. Hey, got me to dad talk and back at you. How about you partying? You can let the dad have a word with him. You mean the dad that was in New York? Right. Here's what the inquiruses about Janet's flash gate. Peanut, uh, titigate, nipple gate. Half time gate. Janet's flash, accidental question mark. Sure, Justin. Justin, think of elsewhere as he exposed Janet Jackson's breast by accident at the Super Bowl, but he deserves the Super Bowl boo-be prize for that fifth insistent insider. The performers planned their moment of shock and off from the get go. After Justin yanked off part of Janet's sexy leather outfit exposing her right breast during their halftime to wet, the booze embodies an MTV which produced the entertainment of apologize. Justin called the exposure of Janet's breast covered only by a unique sunset metal decoration that was attached to the nipple. A wardrobe malfunction and regrettable. But in fact, Janet and Justin wanted to create the same kind of sensation-britney spears in the Don Ignited when they kissed at the MTV Video Music Awards Charged the Insider. They'd rehearse the number of several times with Justin reaching over during the line. I'm going to have you naked by the end of the song and exposing Janet's booze deacety insider all along. They were planning the split second flash flash. It became an escalating game of sexual one-upmanship among the pop celebs because sex sells. Last year Justin grabbed singer-carry menogues boo-dee during a performance at the BitterWords in London and then of course there was the Brittany Madonna Kiss and the Perseultment Video. After Janet's juggernaut, uh-oh, before a hundred million viewers CBS was flooded with protest. Now Janet's just embarrassed and Justin's on edge about the backfired stunt because he's a spokesman for family-friendly McDonald's. Oh, that's why he's apologizing so much. Yeah, Janet and Justin just wanted to titulate but man's don't even irritate and offend says the inquiry and the inquiry rarely makes mistakes. Okay, your fuller crotch Justin. In fact, I got a great new song for him and his friends and in stink, it's called the one-boy boy. Yeah, you freaking little liar pans of you. Man, he is such a twerp. Now we just, I'm so embarrassed by this and my whole family's so sad. But I could say was, you could catch those runaway s's in a butterfly net and him at the same time, by the way. But I have a tight wee. Who are you kidding you? Little pansy. Oh, he did written a spares right. Right, and I just did the Tom Brady here on the floor of my apartment. Right, I was great. Uh, the biggest asshole of the new millennium so far is, look at that, George's WD of Bush don't get no respect. He's like a Roddy Dangerfield of Presence. 141 votes for W. Rush Limbaugh 33. Michael Jackson 28. Michael Paul 13. I'm lucky never Mike. Donald Rumsfield 10. Dick Cheney's got eight for Dick. Justin, take a bell seven, Janet Jackson, two kind of leaves of that's doctorized to us. One. That Chevron goofball. A colon, Paul, and Arnold Schwarzenegger have none yet out of 243.

Even though he's for civil unions, but not marriage. Because they want to just hang him with that, you know. Yeah. Sixty two percent for carry in Michigan in today's pool. Sixty two percent.

Here's a group of people nobody voted for them. They're not elected. They're appointed by their a bunch of cronies and goofballs. And they're a funny goody two shoes attitudes. Pandering to the right wing fundamentalist crowd. And Wow, we can't have anything that has to do with sexual organs or expiratory activity. Now what can you tell me what expiratory activity is.

Told a woman in a restaurant that what she was doing when a scene that she was violating some sort of affinity laws. Right. And the woman in her husband and to leave the restaurant and they did. And they filed a complaint. Oh, I think that's story on her head. Oh, okay. It's against the law to deny a woman the right to. Oh, I'm so sorry. I misunderstood. So I'm not sure.

I bet you're turning green. I've got her in you, do not. You're getting she's so fun. When you look at her online, the teacher, then she's online. We make it my girlfriend. She likes me, man. Every day my hands are gone, her chance. Britney is my girlfriend. She doesn't look at me. But I see that they don't understand me.

Yeah, well, since I'm the father of three girls, I think when a person commits a sex crime against a child, they should be castred and put in prison for a long time. If they kill the child, castrate and hang them, fry them, and we're at lethal injection at top of it all off. This planet needs less people who killed people, and more people are sick of the senseless murdering that goes on every day, especially in the US. This guy may have killed many more, and that's the way it goes in the US, the more people you kill, the less lucky you are to die for it. Someone needs to take this guy out before it gets locked too deeply away. Well, when and down, take him out. I'm all for it. Go get him. Oh, this is on CNN's website. This to me, this is so perfect. This is so American. Wait to hear this. Okay. The Jackson stunt, what now? It questioned Mark is the headline. Super Bowl flashy may encourage crackdown. Let's crack down on his longevity in his perversion, and these bullies, man. We got guys killing little girls out on street corners. We got 560 some on American kids that are dead in Iraq over war that was based on lies. We got the public being raped by corporations that are exporting all of their jobs over the over season. We have a slave labor. In fact, I got the 10 worst corporations of 2003 coming up a little bit later on. Yeah, including beer and clear channel. Oh, clear channel. Oh, no, you're one of the 10 worst corporations in the world. Clear channel, chief channel. You guys suck. Anyway, it says the one second flash of Janet Jackson's breast at the Super Bowl. Can I have a putting the breaks on years of plunging standards in the entertainment industry? Isn't that great? The AP of plunging standards. I thought it was going to say plunging necklines. Oh. This particular event might end way to the who who is saying this. You are going to just, you better get out the toilets. All right, I got the roll. Because you're going to drop a big brown load right in the chair. Oh, that's extra activity. Can we say that? No, like I said, you're going to drop something. That this particular event might be for the moment. The straw that broke the camels back on the patience of the audience said. Talk to your host, Carson Daley. A veteran president's presence on MTV, which produced the offending half time show. Tolerance of this sort of sexual imagery may have reached its peak. Oh, my God. Carson freaking Daley. I'm going to tell you. Exactly. A punk piece of crap repulsive nauseating. Unlike other, my, and of course he presides over the TRL thing, which is nothing but a bunch of hormonal little girls mostly. I'm moving around. Chasing after some fat boy. Unlike other milestones of indecency, Rockstar Bono using the effort on 2003 Golden Globes were Madonna pretty spares, tongue kissing and MTV. Jackson chose to be be able to suffer before the largest TV audience to there. That's what made it bad. As so many people's brains and futures are been polluted and destroyed. And she did it precisely when federal authorities are mulling our crackdown on broadcast in decency. They're going to come and get us, George. Yeah. See you better go through that DCS and Daley. Not just that one thing, but everything. Okay. Everything. Farts on. Verbs. I'll just purge it. The Jackson case could have a galvanizing effect on the move to tough and standard said FCC commissioner Michael Cops, who's one of the word Cops, who's complain this commission has been tuteless and responding to complaints. At the very least he said it punctures the argument of people who say that those who are bothered by such things on TV, you shouldn't watch. How do you turn off the Super Bowl Cops as turn off the half time go get a beer, you schmuck. Like most directional people go get a beer, go take a leak. All right. That's right. DC commissioner is doing not take a crap or a leak because that's ex-cateri activity and since they will all you talk about it, it must be really sick and disgusting and perverted. This is going to be a national conversation on this had Brent Bozell, president of the parents right wing television council, which is long complaint about sex and violence on the tube. They're quoting it. It's just like MSNBC put in a follow-up on there. And I'd all, what a surprise you're here. What he said, right? Brent Bozell. Right wing asshole. Hey, how'd it go, John? Here were the list of things going on. About the Grammys and the Fibment Delay. And about the banker from Knoxville, Tennessee, in her flash action lawsuit. About in the C cutting out a scene from last night's ER that showed an elderly patients of breast. They said that the current atmosphere made it too difficult for a affiliate to air the segment. The current atmosphere, which makes all breasts even those 80 year old memories. Just too, a little too spicy. ABC said it would add delay for its February 29 broadcast of the Academy Awards. TNT also said it was considering a delay. The entertainment portion of the NBA All-Star game featuring Beyonce, outcast and Christina Aguilera. They're going to take away her cheese. The NFL kind of half time production number by one of Tinkerbell's instinct bandmates, JC Shazaz, whatever's name is. Is that it? That's what it says. C-H-A-S-E-Z. How do you pronounce that? Never heard of it. Plan, he's the one who really ugly ones the Bollay Aller. Plan for Sunday's Pro Bowl and Hanalulu because Shazazazz's song contained towards Hornie and Nauti. Oh no! Oh my God! Hornie and Nauti. Are you ready for that? No, I can't imagine any soft respecting. Broadcaster? Performer using words like that. Meersha Hornie? Uh-oh! He'll be replaced by Hula Dancing's and Local Singers. Hula dancers aren't they, we're not like them. Hula Whoops Rasmurts and Coconut can't go into their own. Chicken or Buddies. Yes they are. Shazza's intern is rifty and a film refuses to sing the national anthem to begin what you've been asked to do well How we're gonna survive that? I I'll never be the same me so horny a while spokesman Jim Whitney declined to come and I reports that the company would seek a refund of the seven and a half million dollars if paid to sponsor the half-time show shock and titillation in popular culture is nothing new From Elvis Presley's scandalously swirbling hips to aziosborn's bleepest on his MTV show performance of fact an outrageousness to excite an Insight an audience and let me say it again on is it CTV here? Global one of the other that shows the aziosborn show there are no bleeps Air v one of the words is on over the air TV not just on cable over the freaking air, okay? Okay How is it that just across the border here? We could be so much more progressive and not all a tight about eight things that people are saying on here Unless it's done sherry It's I don't want to get in with that. They're all better shape about him again Boy, well, that's cousin to hockey things. That's what they get it he came oceanal about here You can swear you can show breast you do anything you want basically smoke a lot of weed around the sweet corner But if you start picking on hockey icons like Don Cherry then it causes a big Carfuffle as they say You can you say That's a one of your favorite words here. Carfuffle. Oh, I can make it's a good thing a little silly You know, I say How's that pull coming before were you I read you are great article by Dave Perkins and yesterday's Toronto star NFL must be high five in behind closed doors The biggest asshole of the new millennium so far is we got to 125 votes Not too bad for less than an hour, but not you know not not the herniatic response with which is good because we couldn't keep up with that No, you know, you know, even Eric was just he was even in a bigger panic than usual What are we gonna do? You know this kind of honor. I'll take care of it All we are gonna have a lot of naked pictures on our website Yeah, we are What and what's the FCC going to do about that? Did they regulate the content of the internet? Oh no? No, they don't yet just what's right you and what's the big deal of some 15-year-old kid or 13-year-old kid Goes online and sees naked pictures of Hallie Buries movies or something like that. They'll go kill a bunch of people But they might actually touch themselves The biggest asshole of the new millennium is George W. Bush 181 out of 325 votes 55.6 percent that's the only pull that he's doing over 50 percent Rush Limbo 45 Michael Jackson 41 Rumsfield 15 Michael's Powell's 15 Dick Cheney 13 Just in think about nine Janet Jackson only three see more people hate him because they like they're proud of Janet They want to see the other one kind of Lisa that's Dr. Rice too Colin Powell one Arnold Schwarzenegger is got one of 537 votes everybody nobody don't like Arnold right? The group the data that's because he's dumb the governor Yeah, and if I must be high five of you behind closed doors right so Dave Perkins and the Toronto star He says the National Football League is loving every minute of the debate over Janet Jackson's peatio The NFL is in perfect position here. It gets to tuck-tuck and claim the high moral ground that such a terrible De-prey-fing could have ever happened on our dime When in reality the holiness of the two and a half million dollar commercial spot is not only maintained it probably is enhanced You think anyone is ever gonna try to stage a lingerie bowl again You think anyone's gonna be stupid enough to take on the greatest God in television is super bowl with egg promises of pay for view to the nation The Super Bowl is already delivered the real thing Bosco at gave you the other Jackson There'll be no one trying to upstate next year's halftime show It is to laugh here Paul Taglia boob and the blue suits ring their hands about what those roughings at MTV did to our precious halftime This from a game that only promotes Dallas cowboy cheerleaders and 31 other team sideline QDs But new the much-eyed TV advertisements with feature farting horses and products in it for our erections Simbolized nudge nudged by a gothroom of football through a tire The NFL didn't even know crotch grabbing an overt sexuality with a staple of the network's videos Sure, it's not difficult to believe that no one at the NFL or CBS knew what was coming It's impossible to believe that we're launching a preemptive strike against lingerie bowl two while assuring that this corner They super bowl would remain a lively subject of public discussion for days There are high fives behind the closed doors of the NFL these days When CBS did the good corporate vertically Verticality thing a higher than TV its organizational subsidiary to produce a show featuring pdd Nellie kidrock injection it automatically knew nobody over the age of 35 would watch and anyone who does watch this stuff Those videos can be pretty naughty fine who cares the NFL was used to produce super bowl halftime shows with those show-tune singing younger Republicans named up with people or worse orange juice queen Anita bride was content to aim younger Into exactly what it was doing the tears are now the crocodile variety MTV which he he spells it out EMPT Y MTV also knew how to impress one presented for the first time in its history with a hundred million viewers in a lump Janet she had a new record coming out the next day What could a less-grace exposure hurt for weepy apologies prolong the matter and don't hurt the cause either The other laughable her bump from the NFL came pregame when it threatened several Las Vegas casinos with lawsuits for charging admission to super bowl parties It forced the casinos to pull the plug on the affairs for what nickel and dime better as pay a few bucks for a t-shirt hotdog Enchance to watch the game on a big screen with several like-minded individuals This is the NFL pretending to be concerned about gambling that we all of these Las Vegas handles more on the NFL in general Unsuper bowl in particular every year Gambling is one of the undeniable lifebloods of league and not one petter missed the game or canceled his vet because of this grandstand play As usual the big players were to silly parties They were being caught by the casinos who hire NFL players to hang around in former NFL players to hang around and sign autographs If and when the NFL decides to stop giving out detailed injury information Who's accuracy is enforced by threats of fines for lying that'll show itself to be serious about stopping the flow of gambling on its games Until then like this Janet Jackson thing it's all about perception and pretending to take on the high road It's all a great big con says they perfect. Oh, you don't think they could have known it was coming to you Well, that's really bad In fact, you know what most America would want to see most of the rest of the world a lot more the same Yeah, they want us to be other who be first for like for starters Then next year at the Super Bowl have time we've got to see Brittany. I want to see even I want to see that when it down Just whip them out sweetheart You think they had 90 million people watching as you they have all 300 million people even little infants to be watching the ones that are breastfeeding Oh, mommy that looks just like yours only a lot better than here sir 11 13 at 560 your booby station Q.

I should point out with a K. I just mentioned it in passing up to their son, Olman there. As in Carl Marx, Carl with a K. I don't want to get our spelling right, Eric. Was Jackson Confession taped? In the inquiring, exclusive as usual, these are the same people that told us about that Jesus Jews long before the rest of the mainstream media was telling us about it, and all of most of the rest of this scandal too. And also about the Rush Pill Pop and and Realman, all those things. Did Michael Jackson admit to nation of Islam leader Lewis Ferrican that he molested a child and was the stunning confession caught on an audio tape without Jackson's knowledge? A long time member of the nation of Islam, which they keep referring to as NOI, which we'll call, Oh, noi. Makes the bombshell allegation that Jackson did confess and claims he obtained a copy of the incriminating tape. Now the member who says he walked out of the controversial organization in mid-Jayney where after a 20 year involvement claims he's seeking protection from federal authorities being square was learned exclusively. And if the tape really has Jackson admitting to criminal misdeeds it ends up in the hands of prosecutors, it could be the ultimate smoking gun. That sends Jackson to jail. The 45 year old superstars pleaded not guilty to 7 counts of 20 glue dacks with the child of the age of 14. During an intense investigation the inquire came in contact with a former NOI member, nation of Islam, and met twice with him on the West Coast January 21 and 22. The inquire was withholding the identity of the source because the man said he fears that the NOI would harm his family. He claims he's presently working on a deal to have himself in his family place in a witness protection program, and the change for providing information in federal authorities about his claims of blackmail and intimidation involving the African-American Muslim group. In a telephone call with the inquire on January 27 he said that his part of his deal was turning over the alleged confession taken to officials from a federal agency he would not identify. They can have it because holding onto what is only going to bring them the NOI after me he said, I fear for my life and the lives of my family. The source claims that the nation of Islam conspired to blackmail jacks after the set of our registered attorneys office filed child monostation charges against the senior late last year. The nation has an audio tape recording of Jackson admitting the Lewis Ferracom that he sexually molested the young boy claims the source. The tape was made in December 2003 when Jackson secretly flew to Chicago's mosque, Miriam. Remember Miriam? No. Hey, do. I'll just come in here. Oh, that area. Court of the Service. We show it. And in choir reporter what he claimed was his copy of the tape on the tape Jackson was asked. Did you molest the young boy Jackson response? I did it. Claims the source. I believe the nation recorded Jackson without his knowledge, not to help out authorities, but to use it if it needed to restore it money from Jackson. In mid December, select members of the F.O.I. fruit of Islam security detail. Let's appropriate that the fruit of Islam should be connected with Michael Jackson. We're called to a symbol early in the morning at a warehouse near Torrance, California. About 25 members of the group were briefed on the plan. Several members of the N.O.I. including me says this in former promised hundred thousand dollars by the high ranking members of the N.O.I. for our work, but we had to be willing to do whatever was required. Soon afterward, we loaded an into about five SUV type vehicles and drove to Jackson attorney Mark Garagos office 20 miles away. High-level members of the nation entered Garagos office in mid-Geragos privately, while remaining members waited outside. Inside the members of the nation of Islam offered their services of protection to Jackson exchange for a five and a half million dollar donation. In quotes, donation. Jackson's people were told that if they didn't want to give the national of the nation of Islam a donation, their safety couldn't be guaranteed. After discussing the issue with Garagos, Jackson finally gave the N.O.I. the five and a half million dollar donation. The N.O.I. deposited the money and one of their accounts and switched to lender of the Cayman Islands where a campaign detected by the West government claims the source. Not only is the nation of Islam recorded donation from Jackson, but they're slowly taking over his neverland ranch. Maybe that's why he had live in there no more. Dr. Wilbert White, a former member of the N.O.I. in the line, author of the book Inside the Nation of Islam, a historical and personal testimony by a black Muslim, told the inquire that the intimidation tactics described by the source are not in common for the N.O.I. The Nation of Islam is highly militant, they'll use intimidation by all means, a professor at the University of Central Florida who was appointed a White House commission in 1996, and they will take record absolutely he said. But turn him in! That's true. That's right, next one. Face to my experience, N.O.I. is probably isolated in my clothing, have an N.O.I. member around him 24-7. And what's the N.O.I. is it it's like hell to try to kick them out his involvement with the N.O.I. will ultimately destroy Michael Jackson says this professor. What little reputation he has left will be irreparable. Inquire where phone calls to Mark Urgos and N.O.I. spokesman Durah Mahamid, we're now returned there for the inquire, was not able to confirm the sources of claims with him. Is there anybody in the N.O.I. that's not named Mahamid? No. But a top criminal defensive attorney told the inquire that if the audio tape does turn out to be legitimate, it could be used by prosecutors in the case. If Michael was in a room in Elanoa and admits to the crime, the people in the room and doesn't know he's being taped, then that tape is admissible in court, L.A. defense attorney Steve Cron, who's not involved in the Jackson case, but is following closely told the inquire. There is no expectation of privacy if you're sitting in a room, you can surplish itly, tape someone without their knowledge. So stay tuned. In about a week or two, they'll be telling you about this on a mainstream media. As they point out here, as their patting themselves on the back, Jackson's scoops are old news to readers of the inquire. Newspapers and TV news shows around the world made a big deal of the magazine's supposed scooperies, and Michael Jackson gave a line to an underage boy called it Jesus juice, but the inquire broke that straight months ago, which you heard on his show, I should point out, since the inquire is our Bible. In our issue dated December 16, 2003, we reported that the victim told a thore's Jack O'Servant in wine from a soda can, and called it Jesus juice. There's the latest integrities. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line. We need how many more names would it pull? About 30 minutes. About 50 on there, keep it occupied over the weekend. How is Osama Yamama doing? Because you can be sure he's going to give, but what's he got? Yeah, he's got nine. He's moving it up slowly, but surely he's climbing up that ladder. Always got a long climb to get near the top because the bush marsh has got a head start, 443 votes, and W if you haven't 232. WQAM Hello. WQAM Hello. QAM Ola. I'm very attracted to you. Wow, I'm really happy for you, the feeling of mutual. Bugs off. WQAM Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I got one for your full buddy. Okay. Still angry. Are you sure? Are you sure? Okay. Want to put a fill on there? Yeah, yes. So he's really, a lot of people are pissed off at him because all of a sudden he keeps falling off for right side of the bed. Even his wife is complaining that in the middle of the 90 keeps rolling off the right side of the bed. Always the right side, far right. Yeah, put him on there and what the hell? Okay. And he don't mind. 21 till noon at 560 WQAM, the mad dog, Jim added to 2, the hump or ATT, the World Caribbean golf tournament at golf tournament. Yeah, that would throw to 7 to 7 a half noon boys golf boring or low. Yeah, you know, it's a hanks making a few bucks. You get out of that studio and I go on hopper. Joe and Mark 7 to 10 tonight.

Absolutely. 17 to noon at 5.60. WQM happy Friday 2. You're not to show you how desperate it's becoming. Talk about the dumbing down of America. It's scary now. It's the point of insanity. Celebrity justice. You know that website in that show? See. I'm not gonna read the whole thing about Janet through being half time show. But listen to this. After they have time show it says moments later CBS narrowly avoided another violation. When they managed to keep a streaker off their ear. Just before the second half kick off would. World famous career streaker Mark Roberts stripped down to his G-string at the 30rd line. What your line was at? About 3rd man. Why would a guy in his G-string cause a violation? Is that also what was that mean? I don't know. Is that pathetic? Yeah. They narrowly avoided another violation. In other words, if we've seen this guy in his G-string. Well maybe we would have seen his ass. Well, that's what we saw. Mommy's ass with the 10 year old kid sitting at the breakfast table. Looking at Mommy's ass as she was reaching up and covered. Oh, like old mother Hubbard. That's okay. With the hot ass. He was tackled by Pages Linebacker Matt Chattam, hogtied and carted off by security. But damage caused by the chant and Justin countered already been done. Wait, wait, did he hear this? Offended viewers flooded CBS and the Houston Police Department with the phone calls. The man in the... What the... No, no. The man in the criminal charges be brought against Jackson. But H.P.D. officials quickly determined that no charges would be filed. Still, so let me just as this has learned the FCC's investigating, which came near the close of a busy day for federal watchdogs earlier Sunday. LA Lakers stars Shrikello Neobanov on an ar-weighted tie right after his team's victory over Toronto. But whether or not the commissioner will take action, that case remains to be seen. And the FCC has yet to decide what to do about Nicole Richie's 4-letter frenzy. Last year's Billboard Awards, and they initially decided not to find Bono Yadiyati. And so, but they're gonna look at that again. Oh, good. God, it just wears you out. You know, America grow up like you people most of you say over half in a pool we took a few days ago. Grow up already, Woya. Jesus, effen Christ, man. They called the police. They called the Houston Police Department because Justin picked that thing off Jen and its TV. What did they report? A straight... One away, bro. One away, booby. Well, that's why they call it the booby, tooby. Oh, my God, and. Over at Warner Brothers. After receiving assurances of support from Andrew NBC Entertainment and News President Jeff Zucker, producers of ERW or Shocktiller, and yesterday that the breath revealing scene would be cut near our shore last night. According to a source NBC affiliates when overzuckers had to complain that in view of the Jackson incident, they believed they would get a big fat in decency find or record Washington, if they are to split second corner shot during a 10-pea medical drama. This is a 10 o'clock at night, keep in mind. In which an 80-year-old woman shirt is ripped off so doctors can give her emergency treatment. Ah, like I said, I just want to fall on a floor make gutterable sounds. In consultation with our affiliate board, we've asked ER to remove the shot, the GE division said in the statement, though we continued to believe the shot is appropriate and in context we would have heard. After 10-30 p.m. Eastern Pacific time is when it would have been on, we have unfortunately concluded that the atmosphere created by this week's events have made it too difficult for any of our affiliates to airless. After 10-30 at night, it would have been on, not in that family of viewing time, which is what the excuse they gave her to Super Bowl on that hoopla when little children were tuned in. 10-30 at night. ER's executive producer John Wells responded angrily in the statement, while the unexpected exposure of Mr. Jackson's breast during the Super Bowl half time show was inappropriate and deplorable on a broadcast intended for viewers of all ages. ER's incidental exposure in an elderly woman's breast in the context of a medical trauma is not comparable, no Schmidt, basically what he's saying that some saggy old 80-year-old woman's boob is not comparable to Janet Jackson's. What a revelation, huh? Oh my gosh. Shocking. Grow up America before it's too late, your sons and daughters are dying based on lies halfway around a freaking world. And what's the far right these lunatics worried about is a little vitty titty. I never did play that yesterday, so that I got in with that. Well, I will today, but while we still can. Probably Duffel, come on in. Oh gee, you're back out and you can't say titty. Sure we can, but you may have to listen to it. Since everything else it's not, you're from the hate said titty stuff. What a pity. He don't always titty. I'm telling you right now. What does he know about titty, huh? He said, what the, he said to me before the show on Monday, more so what was that thing? I said that was a boob. Oh my god, he said, never so one of those before. Anyway, oh after, after, well, that's right, we got a few minutes here. I'm getting ahead of myself, just slow down, just relax. Because I know we got a lot of really good calls to get in today. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. We should have many more names on his list, but they just, they're not, their minds, their hearts aren't in it. You know, we still. Maybe they figured they just can't compete with the top. We've got such a good list, a very strong roster. The biggest asshole of the new millennium so far is 481. We'll have 500 votes by noon at him too, bet. We won't make $1000 a day though. Josh, don't get all carried away. We'll never make a thousand of that. I just want you to be prepared for that. Okay. I don't probably destroy your whole weekend. George W. Bush 249, Rush Limbaugh 69, how appropriate man. Michael Jackson 54 as in Car 54, where are you? Let's play some more of them. Show to the theme. Just to stop that. You make it work. You get to say show to the. No, I was not as a matter of fact. Okay. I was going to say show toons. Oh, oh, what do you know me? Michael Paul 22, Dick Cheney 22, Osama Yamama is moving up very strong now. He's coming on. He got it. We got left in the gate at the start, but he's making a big move. In fact, even talk off his burka. Don, the lawn 21, runs failed 16, just in Tickabell's got a dozen. But Janet Jackson's got five and a lot of people want to see the other four. Kind of leaves has got three. Carl Roe of three. Wayne Hyping has got a pair. Arnold Schwarzenegger's got two. Colin Paul one and no votes yet for Dan Marino or. Phil Hungary. Are you sure? I just looked at it. I just took a peek at it. Oh, somebody will vote for him because they're disgusted and nauseated with somebody that we used to really like a lot. But you know, you find out what a person's really all about when the push comes to show. You know, when it's really all online. I'm how quick they sell out. I was speaking of selling out. This is one of my favorite stories in history. But we ought to take call or two first. QAM Hello. Yeah, I'm Daniel. Yes, sir. Yeah, put it back in your pants, mug. Yeah, you can either lump them with a idiot brother or you can use them alone. Governor Jeb Bush the worst governor we've had in 30. Jeb Bush is magnificent. Thank you so much sir. Okay. And have a great weekend. How will we leave him off of there? That's Reverend Bush to you, by the way. Yeah. Reverend Jeb Bush. Hi. Come on. 560. 560. How long I told you this was to grow. But I shouldn't slowly. We can stretch it out. Yeah, cruise. Just don't let any way see it, but stretch it out. WQN. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. Yeah, I think the meal. Yeah, I think the meal is going to be fine. So, speaking. Leo. Yeah. How are you? Okay. The reason why Ben Laden cannot be found is because he's hiding at the Bush Ranch. WQN. Hello. Shomba. WQN. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi. Ha ha ha ha. That's shimpen came in. You see, it always comes in when we release the expected. Nobody ever tells us, bastards. Where do I get on the list for that? Your would like to share. In fact, you know, past maybe that's why my mom was out this morning who's getting his share. See? Everybody gets theirs. Everybody gets it on, except us. WQN. Hello. How you doing? I'm going to get it. WQN. Hello. WQN. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, Leo. How are you doing? Great. I agree. Still Henry put him on the list. That's my vote. Yeah. What, what a disappointment. And this is not a joke. When you all become the loser has a super tanker, a Chevron super tanker named after her. That's she really? Yeah. If you are a fashion, I read it somewhere. I'll try and look at that. If I did it, tell her. Is it called a doctor, right super tanker? No, kind of leisure. Doctor, right, doctor, kind of leisure, super tanker. Okay, thanks for the good news, pal. Why are we talking about? Do we start about? Yes. You do? That's the ancient. I never heard that before. We'll see you. I learned something. Do I care? No. Ten wars corporations of 2003 by Russell Moe Kiber and Robert Weissman. For our day? Well, Robert Moe Kiber or whatever his name is, editor of the Washington DC based corporate crime reporter, Robert Weissman editor of the Washington DC based multinational monitored their co-authors of corporate predators to hunt for mega profits in the attack on democracy. So already we like them a lot. 2003 was not a year of garden variety corporate wrongdoing. No, the sheer variety reach in intricacy of corporate schemes. Candle and crumbs was spellbinding, not in these years to pick the 10 worst companies for sure, but multinational monitored magazine cannot be deterred by such complication then so here follows enough medical order. Our list for multinational monitor of the 10 worst corporations of 2003. Oh, right. Magnificent list. Starting with? Bear. Oh, absolutely. Your own standards of the stop-opens track of everyone. Right. 2003 maybe remembers the year of the headache at bear. Which we applaud. In May the company agreed to plead guilty to a criminal count and pay more than $250 million to resound allegations that it denied Medicaid discounts to which it was entitled. The company was beleaguered. Ah, beleaguered with litigation related to its anti-cluster all drug bank call, pay or pull the plug which is linked to sometimes fatal muscle disorder from the market, but is facing thousands of suits from patients of alleged they were harmed by the drug. In June the New York Times reported on an internal company memos which appeared to show that the company continued to promote the drug even as its own analysts and revealed the dangers of the product. Bear of course denies the allegations just like they probably been on making that poison gas during WW2. Bear. It's a court gas. Oh, that's number one. Number two. Boeing. Order. I knew that was coming. And one of the greatest schemes of corporate welfare and recent memory. Boeing engineered a deal whereby the Pentagon would lease tanker planes. 767th that would fuel fighter planes in the air from Boeing. The price tag of $27.6 billion was billions more than a cost of simply buying the planes. The deal may unravel though because the company November filed for wrongdoing both the employer that negotiated the contract for Boeing, the company's chief financial officer, and they employed the negotiator the contract for the government. How could Boeing fire a Pentagon employee? Simple. She was no longer a Pentagon employee, Boeing and hired her shortly after the company, clinched the deal. Start to see these things fit together the case of the puzzle. Just like Billy Toeson down there in Louisiana and his friends in the pharmaceutical companies. Company number three, the worst of the year, and I don't know who they are, Bright House. Give her her that. Nope. A new AG advertising consulting strategic advice company, Bright House is claimed to inform me as it's Neuro strategies institute, which undertakes research to see how the brain response to advertising campaigns. In a cutting edge effort to extend and sharpen the commercial reach in ways never previously before possible, the institute is using MRIs to monitor activity in people's brains triggered by ads. Okay. In fact, I think they got Sheridan on passions as all type of machine. Sheridan gets the juice again today big times. Quartz 40 May. Wow, it is a beautiful thing. Clear channel. Oh, I'm going to squeeze myself as I read this one. One of the 10 worst corporations of 2003, Deep Channel. The radio B-A-Moth clear channel specialized in consuming or squashing locally owned radio stations, imposing a homogenized music playlist on once interesting stations, and offering cultural support for US imperial adventures. It is also compiled a record of repeated law breaking according to our colleague Jim Donahue, violating the law, including prohibitions on the set of advertising, and I'm broadcasting conversation without attending permission of the second party to the conversation. I'm 36 separate occasions over the previous three years. Not to mention of course the bookkeeping problems that they were recently fine for, and the 755 grand that they were fine for for indesancy, not to mention those things of course. Next one is Di Bold. Oh, there's this ambivalence on here. But I think we better do the break, because I don't want to rush to all of these. Did you say rush? Don't want to do that. Four minutes to load at 5.60, Q-A-M. This mark, Morgan, is the 12-1 hour on Q-A-M. Alright. The new time is seen that we're lagging in the cold. Hey, bro, about a headline that will be you by the cold. You say, and say, is the one, again, now they, I only want to take the day, take them away. Don't forget about sugar, we've got it. Now we're all cooking and saying, you got it. You don't need to take this, though, you got it. Where is the light to go? You say, my love is what they got you to do. Can't get any gum, but the one, on it, could have been. You believe what they say, and they say, like the cold, I look for the whole, as they do in their days, thus they're in a state for their call, and through, for the election of, without us, who shall die in any new figure, and then on your knees, we got it. You're a true man. You got it. From the United States, WQM, Jimenez, the two, the Humperate, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, the Gulf, largest U.S. voting machine manufacturers and an aggressive peddle of its electronic voting machines, dive-old has managed to demonstrate that it fails any reasonable test of qualifications for involvement with the voting process. Its CEO has worked as a major fundraiser for President Bush, computer experts revealed serious flaws in its voting technology, and active as show how careless it was with confidential information. It's written lawsuits against activists who published on the internet documents from the company showing its failures. Next. Haliburton. Now, the owner of the company, which initially drafted plans for privatization of U.S. military functions, plans for active during the Bush-Wanted Administration when current vice-president former Haliburton CEO Dick Cheney was secretary-defense. Haliburton is pulling in billions and revenues for contract work, providing logistical support ranging from oil to food in Iraq. Tens of millions at least appear to be overcharges, some aimless say the charges for oil provisioned among two highway robbery, and of course the meals and yoddi-oddi-oddi-oddi. Haliburton. Haliburton. Half-south. 15 of its top executives had pledged guilty in connection with a multibillion dollar scheme to defraud investors, the public and US government about the company's financial condition. The founder and CEO of the company that runs a network of outpatient surgery, diagnostic imagery, and revealed to F.A. of health care centers, Richard Scrashie is fighting the charges. But thanks to the slick maneuvering of attorney Bob Bennett, and appears the company itself will get off Scott-Free, no indictments, no pleas, no fines, no probation, no sticky nor washing. In a med. The California Base Company sought FDA approval for a silicone breast implants. Even though it wasn't able to present long-term safety data, the very thing that led to the FDA to restrict sales of silicone implants a decade ago. And light of what remains unknown to know what is known about the implants affecting including painful breast hardening, which can lead to deformity in very high rupture rates, the FDA in January 2004 denied in a meds application for marketing approval. Merrill Lynch. This company keeps messing up. Fresh off a $100 million fine-levy because aimless recommending stocks that they trashed in private emails, the company saw three former ex-ex-indicted for shady dealings with and run. The company itself managed to escape with something less than a slap on a wrist, no prosecution in exchange for oversight. However, they're still looking over their shoulder and they're laughing. And last but not least, although we don't have them in San Florida, Safeway, you heard of them? Sure, shopped their office. You did? I had in Montana. And elsewhere, sure. One of the largest US grocery chains, Safeway is leading the charge to demand kick a give-back from striking and locked out grocery workers in Southern California, along with Albertsons and Ralphs, which is part of the Crober chain, Safeway's vans and pavidians stores are asking employees to start paying for a major chunk of their health insurance, under the company's proposals, workers and their families will lose four to $6,000 a year in health insurance benefits. So there are the 10 worst corporations in 2003, and I would say let's be easily offer probably a bubbling under. Spopatever, Boeing, Bright House, Chief Channel, DiBold, Haliburton, Heltsouth, Inamed, Merrill Lynch and Safeway. What is that scumbags? Joseph Petersmith. On the authorities, went to arrest him and said, let's go to an alisance. On related drug charge. So of course, Brad, you see probably behind me. There are some flowers and centetti bears and people walking around with Carly Ribbons on themselves. I'm glad they found him, but they also find those tablets that he's been hiding in Surasona. 5605060, pound-560 on a AT&T in Verizon line. Biggest asshole of the new millennium so far is, and we got a very impressive list. I'm sure we can add some. We'll probably get like two or three more real calls between now and two, and two, and two, and two. Maybe, one, two. WQA and hello. So not yet. There's one. No. WQA and hello. Neil. Yes sir. For the poll. Dennis Miller is a magnificent choice. Excellent. He was a funny 10 years ago. He's not funny now. He couldn't be a sportscaster. What better qualifications to be talking to him on a news channel now. On a right wing news channel right. I had a Fox news with him. Thanks, pal. Alright, thanks. Dennis Miller, he'll get a lot of votes. Osama, your mama's moving up steadily though, but I don't know. This will be up there all weekend, this pool. So he's got a shot. Osama's got a shot. Preferably between the eyes. 5605060, pound-560. My microwave is like beep to second time in oath. That means more water. No, I don't think that. That means it's done, dummy. It can't give me. But you wish to look to it. It'll take me like 10 seconds. Here we go. Plus that after a few seconds you're giving the right wingers the Ditto heads in opportunity and plenty of time to turn over to IOD and Hirosh. Hirosh. Let's hear the inside story. The Clintons are still murdering people. Everywhere. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised it was the Clintons that done in Sirus Odenothi guy. If you don't have diarrhea, the Clintons did it. 560505060. I don't think I've ever, well, maybe I have. Don't that be full. Of course, the bad part of it is when you grab the handle of your cup, especially when you head into the microwave for two and a half minutes before the water was in there. It tends to be just a little on the warm side. WQAM, hello. And back at you. WQAM, Ola. Hello, yes sir. Yeah, can you put that asshole that just killed that little girl on your pole? Joseph Smith. Okay. That's a good choice right there. Let's go get him in. Yeah man. Pick it up. Here. What's his last name though? What do you mean by that? I thought it was Joseph Smith something. No. It is? I don't know. I don't think so. Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith, boy? I'll tell you they're killing me then, bushes. I don't believe so. Joseph Smith is good enough. How about Sirus Odenothi? Sirus Odenothi murderer in parentheses. Otherwise, I'll think we're talking about Joseph Smith. We'll get the Mormons all been on the show. I don't want to get my buddy dining Osmond upset. What? What do I want to do that? No. So let's say do that. Sirus Odenothi. How are we going to say? 560 pound, 560 on the AT&T in Verizon while the slide. WQAM, hello. Hi, Sally. Yes sir. I don't know if you happen to see Rumpfield getting grilled a couple days ago. A little bit of it. Yeah. And your buddy loving there with the glasses and said, yeah. Yeah, but it was by vocal vases. Yeah. But you know, hey, because the good thing someday, they're rick them over the calls and they fumbled and stumbled and did a usual tap dance and dance round everything. But it was good. I love what the new line is now. And of course, the media's letting him get off the hook with the net is, well, even if they never had any of these weapons of mass destruction, he was a bad guy and we still do the right thing. I mean, duh, what is that? But the world's full of bad guys. Yeah, right. And most of the market may have bad guys that we stuck in there. I mean, including him. But, you know, I'm gripping it. I'm like, I've got it for as well. Good. Good to see you tomorrow. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon while the slide. Oh, there's Colin Powell. He's saying the same thing now after they took him out to the woodshed. So solid intelligence base. When we present to the case to the United Nations in September, here before last, the president took the action. This is totally justified. You're right. See, now this is really interesting. How they really whipped him in the shape. I think they made him an offer that he couldn't refuse. Toby, could that get there? 560, 50560 on the AT&T. What's wrong? We're replaying that, you know. That's okay. Well, we're seeing again. They had a, say, the other thing. He was a bad guy. He stole a freight train or two. And for that reason. WDQM. QM, Ola. You need to include some fair and balanced angles to your list. They're like, uh, the, uh, and cultures, Sean Hannity or Bill Riley. That's, uh, three good ones. Okay. Thank you so much. And culture and Bill O'Riley, who is the, I'm Sean Hannity. You know, let's put all three of them on there. I'll tell you what, man. He doesn't get too many votes because nobody knows who's, we don't want to pick on this fudge. Now that they guy talked about his book. I didn't even know he had a book. Don't they all? I guess everybody wrote a book that said me. I'm going to start writing it right now. Tell me all about Greg Roe. All these people go straight. The books. You don't have to do any work. Somebody asks you a few questions. They write. You get a check. There you go. Sound excellent. Rush did it. Hats stern. All these other people. Yeah, but those are like big fish in the big pond. I'm like a little teeny tiny fish on the station with. A little, uh, a little, uh, signal stereo though. We got an international audience on the website. That's right. WQM. Hello. QM. Yeah. Can I talk to Neil? Reconfer. I'm calling from Wellington. Let's go to Wellington, hello. Neil, uh, I wonder how to ask you quite a lot of take views. All right. Hey, there was a game. Wasn't there a ride? All right. That was a game. I'm from Boston. But I just want to tell you a quick little story. I don't like to, you know, call one, show and talk. I call, uh, I'm driving the other day. And this genius that's on after you is saying how this riding and fires and horrible things happening in the city of Boston. Yeah. Um, I'd say I called yes. There was. What? Otherwise, there was one horrific automobile accident where a, and that's you V-drove, uh, into a young college. He backed up. He backed up through a crowd of people and they were fires. I saw it myself with my own free eyes on. I was a, you know, I'm from, you know, don't ever come to your boss from the South Florida. I, I, I lived in Boston for two years. I love Boston, but that doesn't mean that there aren't barbaric assholes in Boston because there are no, of course, though. But what do you find it? What are you trying to say? Why you picking up my good buddy, the mad dog because he's probably going to like a one. Probably got an IQ of minus six. I mean, I listen to him. But is that you be by 15 points? Go back to Boston, okay? I'm straight with your boss. Go back to Harvard square. Schmuck, go back to Kenmore square. Jesus. See, then we want to talk about the game. This is what really gets me. He's all uptight. Now, Boston is light, light years at a South Florida. The only problem is there are a bunch of blue nose assholes. They're in some other assholes. They want to censure this and censure that. It's, uh, everything is banned in Boston. In fact, this guy was probably banned in Boston, which is why he went up in South Florida. Right. Loser. That sucks here. That's why he's here. That's right. That's why he's in South Florida right now because it sucks so much. At least I'm out there. I'm on the air. There is survived. They out of there as much as possible because it's filled with too many people like you. It's a miserable nasty rotten, full of hate, full of crap. Man, just in a minute and a half, he sped so much crap there. We all saw the story. It was in a, I mean, you know, maybe somebody can read it to you out of the newspaper out of the Boston Globe.

Great column in the British newspaper The Guardian by Peter Bowes. US Apoplexy over Jackson Flash. Two seconds of bear flesh and America's be cited self with Indignation and outrage, Janet Jackson's Super Bowl stunt, which he says went further than she planned, has left the US in a state of mass complexity on the subject of taste and decency and broadcasting. A few moments after the now infamous wardrobe malfunction, a great ingest and Tinkerbell told the ex-Sahalibu TV show, hey man, we love giving you something to talk about. Ready for that? Yeah. See there's the exact quote. That's putting it mildly. It says here, I know many people in other countries are scratching their heads and thinking, what in the world is the big fuss over there said Robert Thompson, directly the Center for Study of Popular TV at Syracuse University. That was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in a sports spectacle said baseball coach Tommy LaSorta. But this country takes exposed breast very, very seriously. We get very exercise about such things Thompson said, there's no denying the level of public fury. Within minutes of the Super Bowl halftime performance the internet was a buzz with angry chatter and phone lines to CBS's New York headquarters word Jand. They were jaminate. This was the most disgusting thing I've ever seen LaSorta said, in Los Angeles. They just absolutely ruined the fact it was one of the greatest Super Bowl games ever seen said Tommy who's over spaghetti like crazy. He's up to about 400 pounds. Timothy in the UK said there was more naked flesh on the show in the Super Bowl advertisements than Miss Jackson's performance. Where's the outcry about that? But on a scale of terrible things that happened in public is a fleeing the bear breast so terrible? No. Jand had been just in mortal owners sitting in questionable taste during the Super Bowl. The telecast also featured sexed up commercials for beer. But there's a lot of sexy up going on, right? Remember Dr. David Kelly? Oops. Also featured sexed up commercials for beer and they say it worked. I love it. And add star starring a flat shell in horse and others for erectile dysfunction drugs. But apparently they don't compare that with the impact of exposed body part. Maybe when we left the old country we somehow froze certain attitudes, Mr. Thompson said, he's not saying we're pure tactical, is he? While other attitudes began to evolve elsewhere we had we held to many of them very carefully said, there's a paradoxical part of the American character where we simultaneously are arguably the most obsessed about sex of anybody else on the entire planet and at the same time the most uptight about it. Televisions most of the TV we played moments provoked a level of debate that is unprecedented and there have been many calls for sweeping changes in ways broadcasters are regulated. While the Jackson breast exposes a easily upstage the entire Super Bowl event, the commercials Iraq and the Presidential Lush in campaign, the online issue is nothing new for U.S. broadcasters. There has been this dynamite and culture wars, the idea of what is appropriate and what is not appropriate on the public your ways, and it's been sitting around waiting for a long time to go off and Mr Thompson, how do you like that? Have cues. So the bomb went off baby, just smell it. Was either the bomb or maybe just in court one when he ate that thing up? He made this sudden motion. And why does he talk black all of a sudden or did he always? Oh, because he's he's it may he's He didn't call you he's a rapper not to listen He's a little fancy man. He's a little butterfly just in all of America's looking at you and they're going Hit loss take a hike soon As John Kerry would say don't let the word door hit you any ass on a way out So John Kerry gets endorsed by him. Who was it? Oh, get by dick. Okay. Who are give her this morning? We're excited about well it's a good union thing. You know to give art the union people still I he's a pawn of that mean he's a very popular with unions And Kerry has pulled on 62% of Michigan going into the big du caucus tomorrow See I this whole thing with some states have caucuses and primaries some state just have caucuses some states have just primaries They it's all a pile of crap and you wonder why so many people are interested in that when it can be all excited about Jan's Titi the biggest asshole of the new millennium so far is George W. Bush is hanging on to a very strong lead 297 50.3% over half of you said that out of 590 almost 600 votes Rush Limbaugh 78 Michael Jackson 60 Osama Yamama who's the late edition and we apologize for that 47 we got one we give a little handy kep there Michael Paul 25 Dick Cheney 25 Donald Rumsfield 19 Justin Tinker Rell 14 Carl Roe for the case got six Janet Jackson five kind of Lisa three Arnold three Danny marino's got two That's disrespectful is mad dog would say it's got two Wayne highs in good two Dennis Miller one colon Paul one Joseph Smith. See I think we're gonna put the murder over there But these only got one We were supposed to but Eric didn't hair I get with it Maybe Sean Kennedy's got one and no votes yet for Jeb Bush Bill O'Reilly and Culter You see how that spelled KAL TER Call if you don't have any votes or Jeb Bush and Phil Henry has still got the big off are you sure positive 27 pass no and 560 Q AM You In celebration of black history month CBS television proudly presents 16 average Americans are abandoned in the middle of one of the most unforgiving places on earth It's survivor come to who will survive that drive by both as The two tribes And my baby daddy's Compe for the immunity bling and not get voted off the hood The pilot by at two and a half wife man on CBS 31 at 560 WC man. I'm just thinking to myself. I got a whole bunch of stuff here, but I don't want to sit here read for now on a half Okay, and probably what's your name's listen to our Jamaican friend yeah, and she was so distraught that we didn't finish with all the TV themes Just read show her here from my big pile of the CD What we didn't come close to finishing did we? So for whatever her name is Rosto Lady. Yeah, oh, yeah, I'm gonna stick some of these back in here again because we just we've only begun to apply this crap On you know the one I really like is the one the TV classics. Yeah, the one that's got like some of the live Some of the old commercials that some of these people did you know the one I'm talking about for example Well wait, man, let me give you a sample It's queueing up just relax. Don't get off. Don't get all panicky. I think it's queueing up Maybe it's good. Oh I Reforce with a speed of light a cloud of dust and a hearty high-o silver The lone Ranger Why thought it was gonna be about Pete Lenny there. They're they're loona ranger So sure as good if we don't have to see him anymore, isn't it? Although we'd rather have him back in your rid of time wreck any day the week. I'll take it that So we'll get to some more though is just to piss off that one lady so she can call him up again on Monday Oh, gee, I did like that man and that was so bad that Paul question was so I didn't like that knee there I bet your cash money. She's on the phone right now with moth. I was probably out to lunch I bet your cash money on that. Yeah, if it meeting this morning at about eight thirty said Somebody just want to kind of talk things over and see what that was going on And he said why should be the last one until that? Well, he's a little bit of a loop these days. Yeah, he's doing his fruit loops McCain will serve on a P. War Intelligence panel. That's the good news out of these Of course the president's picking them that's the bad the above bad news and even worst bad news is that we're not gonna fight out of up their investigation until after the election Right. I mean, what if they finished by like say November 1st of this year by October 25th and they say oh my god, we found out a whole lot No way We don't want to be injecting no politics into your revelations We want to make sure we can try to fix it again to get him in there and then we'll like water with down to make some death threats and things like that And it'll be just like with George ten of the other day, but it'd be better. But it will blow out you know things like that Wison probe looks for truckers for help You see this nope now maybe we'll have some happier because obviously the FBI and all of our other Police agencies across America Can do nothing with the anthrax probe how many years has that been now it's getting two and a half years right? or so Yeah Since the anthrax business right there in Lantana. It started and then kind of spread to DC and elsewhere I have no result. We didn't have that person of interest though He's likely destroyed but other net not too good So in a nationwide hunt for the person who sent rice in through the mail and uses the name fallen angel Federal officials have sought help from trucker talk radio shows and web chat sites that have attracted heated debate about trucker safety regulations that took effect January 4th Them truckers man there on it. We got a lot of truckers listen to this show But we have got no rice in law enforcement officials say they've also begun scouring the rosters of trucking companies nationwide Try to develop leads from a flimsy set of clues. I didn't even heard about this. Did you know the clues that they got? Though in an type note left along with a small file of rice in an email facility in Greenville, South Carolina in Minottober Which they hadn't told us about until a couple days ago The perpetrator is time to be a fleet owner of a tank company with easy access to cast or pulp from which the deadly poison rice in is made a second letter and I why didn't they tell us that right off the bat when Bill first was up there about a week But it would but why didn't they tell us that right away? Don't ask questions a second letter. We've treated November 6 from a mail facility that serves the White House contained an identical letter and a similar file of rice in powder Authorities revealed that mailing this week after rice was discovered the offensive of a cemetery in the Middle-Farth. So the resistive been going on since October then again November here it is almost a middle of February Last week of the request of the FBI Department of Transportation Dale Summers No relation to Suzanne Summers or Aaron hosted the property of truck and bozo radio show broadcast out of Cincinnati It's the old truck and bozo show Spent three nights on the air appealing to the person who planted the rice and package the facility near the greenville Spartanburg International Airport Summer city was contacted by FBI agents in Greenville including Merit and Martin Brown who's heading to bestugation air and by Heather Hollowell With the transportation department in specular generals office in Washington who has that the broadcast information about a hundred thousand dollar reward Posted for information leading to an arrest Tom O'Neill spokesman for the FBI office in Columbia South Carolina said agents have been following trucker websites and trucker oriented radio programs including summer show and another popular radio show hosted by Seattle cowboy bill Mack it's the truck and bozo in the Seattle cowboy Max producer Ken Johnson said the show is mentioned the rice and matter of an out-of-a-s discussions on it Summer said the message is left in Greenville which warned federal authorities not to expand the time truckers Must spend resting and sleep or birth from me to ten hours Makes it clear the person is either a trucker or someone is affected by these new rules and if Michael Powell wore for give me Maybe he's a mother trucker. Can I say that? No, like I said I beg your forgiveness put it in me now I don't want to play these but Well work you know I'm so happy about that Never one green one green one of the many Americans who believe in the Protection like old Girlopa´s Stop the machen show № 2 wszystkieanders ⇯ curiosity is quite important for comparison 💜 2 fifty µ  Hey, this is joke karar Wang Hi, son The rifleman, this is the truth of the rifleman. Are you serious? The rest of the says here, and that was your child's honor on your advancing. I hope the rifleman started with you. The soldier's honor started with you.

This is Clint Eastwood saying so on the best of lunch. See if that's what I'm talking about. We were rolling roll and rolling. Though this means it's all in them. She then all is rolling roll and roll. I've ran into it in the way. I've been forever. I can't fly my side. All the things I've been through. Who's been serving this? Are we in a deal? I don't know. I don't know. I'll bet. Well, you know, this is a kind of fun and everybody likes it. Except for that one lady. So I'll ponder during the break whether we want to continue doing any more of this. Because we still have an hour and 20 minutes to go to salvage what we're doing here today. Sure, which we could see her while this is going on. Oh yeah. I sure love to see the anguish looks on her post. And see her frantically. She's got that baby on speed die. I'm on your wall. This is for 20 places. You wait. Hey, you bastard.

Last week our former chief weapons inspector, David K, reported that Saddam Hussein's regime had weapons programs and activities in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions, but no weapon and was a gathering threat to the world. But no weapon. Dr. K also stated that some pre-war intelligence assessments by America and other nations about Iraq's weapon stockpiles have not been confirmed. We're determined to figure out why. We're also determined to make sure that American intelligence is as accurate as possible for every challenge in the future. Right.

No. Send himself a fire at his parents home. And you know what happens to when you set yourself on fire, you become FUNNING! Right, gay. Hubbard who led the Roman Catholic D.A.C. of Albany since 1977 said he never met these delays and he had new of no records point per 10 of the sex abuse. Thomas Lee obviously by any priest who served the Albany D.A.C. He said the Zalay said his brother was distruct because Hubbard had abused him. Well, we don't believe that doing. You know Hubbard.

No. A word from Howard Dean's wife. Hey, tell her. Handacked her journalist, I learned. Why if a presidential candidate Howard Dean. You can call me Judy. Not judge Judy. That's that different reskite. People want to know why I'm hardly ever on campaign trail with Howard. Hey, did you get a good look at me in Iowa? I scared a crap out of myself. I make proud for this and I look like a shane opponent. Stop me if I'm bombarding you with too much, Judy. Anyway, how he says after I showed up his numbers drop it. No, I say that's a bunch of mischagas. For those of you who don't have to compete with, you know, that means crap. How is a good guy? Though he's what you might call a loose cannon. He's got a pretty bad temper on him. I remember one time when the red kids left the cap off of the toothpaste. I thought he was going to blow a gasket. The veins popped out in his head and that white spit strings were born in the corners of his mouth. Even Maschuga, I spent 23 years with this shagots. Most of the time he's a mench, but on occasion, I hate him. I think my husband, Howard, would make for a very good president. One of the things I'm a little peoed about is that how he doesn't let us have a TV. I've got a watch section to city. I got a shut down to campaign headquarters, or to the croggers to watch on some tiny black and white set. I have never seen any program in color, so I'm no Jackie Kennedy. Hell if you look at me, I'm no Ted Kennedy. I don't wear makeup. I'm like a whisker away from being amish. Don't expect to see much more of me during the campaign. The only reason I'm addressing you today is because I was able to chew through my restraints. Anyway, Gazagazon, that's your dish for Dr. Judistain. Over and out. Oi, buddy. I'm going to be like John Kerry. It's a 156 maddog in four minutes to two o'clock. We got to get in a whole bunch of these calls before we go in. We're all way. All of them.

What for does that? I don't know. I heard a goldie says that. Oh, where goldie says it smells like boy. I can't believe Josh is actually paying attention to a best boy. I mean, I wouldn't. I sure wouldn't. Especially these calls today. But he's man. He is hanging on every word you guys are saying. I paid too much attention to what's but these colors because that's where the sports people are going to because you guys are the show. That's what mad dog always says. You guys are the show. Now, people you just really believe that. No, no, he's just he's just trying to suck up a little bit. You know, trying to be humble and things like that. Oh, and you know what I must forgot? Cause I know the mad dog's going to be talking a lot of hockey. The game last night. And I know the Panther company on a Phoenix was great. Lisa, losing four nothing in Ottawa after all. It ended the second period. Four nothing. Okay, calm down Joe. Say your voice. Who's got the old fabric? Have you heard you say something about I thought you were bullying my performances.
