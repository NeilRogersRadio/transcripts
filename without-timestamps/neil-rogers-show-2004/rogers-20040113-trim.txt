That's not too shabby right right by the way Bob for most continues to be an asshole See this is what happens when you put somebody we say well this guy is corporate He's corporate he's with the big shots over there in a bee's leaves and Naples in fact Even though I climb up on one of their three under the limit of the tree and hang out with him once And why yeah the banjo three is the banjo yeah he picks it and the banjo two Hey for both you and idiot many went and changed to be but he's password to get into the computers We almost had a disaster here.

Look how well we've been doing last few years here and can you imagine how much better we could all See now you're starting trouble with pipe dream. See that's one thing about most people in the world most people are willing Don't they'll take whatever comes along. They don't give a crap what choice you got most people are mediocre They don't strive for greatness and And that's certainly is the case about this place man as long as we get the ball scores on it As long as we're doing Danny and Dave and Dave and Danny and Danny and Dave and Wayne and Whatever by the way Wayne you're a fricking liar baby Yeah But that oh it was like dizzy roll over again that thing and when I heard them play this morning that clip Where he was bitching out our our Mundo Suggaro and her video to report it was the beat the dolphin beat writer He was beaten it and he was ripping them in ass for high-fiving and Buffalo when the dolphins were Squeeze out of the playoffs when Denver one you're a liar Wayne Because that's the first thing that everybody thought I have a machin TV yesterday and here comes Tony cigarette a one there and our good buddy Little dog Joe Rose with it.

What was us? See I think he enjoys it he enjoys it. He loves it. Yeah, he thrives on a great All the Patriots and all the insecurity in the paranoia in the back stabbing and he's got the water not to be running around Eaves dropping in a hallway, you know In fact it wouldn't surprise me if the beast is his mole. Maybe that's the mole.

Well, that was a terrible question. You're not fooling anybody. That's the first thing that will come to everybody's mind. Oh, this is a PR move to pacify the angrier angrier anguish fans. And if it's not, well, you know, and then we'll see. Time will tell. So there's our first poll today. What's the last time we took a Danny Marino poll? I guess it was maybe back in Jimmy and Danny days. Okay. And Danny and Jimmy? I think we're going to have like 14 or devotes on yesterday's poll. If we just leave it up there another second or two, we got 13 IDEA. That'll make me very excited. Do you believe that? You know, it sounds stull and off on the most of it. No, it's not only that. I want to make sure that all the Howard sperm people are turned over here. I want the whole world to hear this story. Because this is a, what's today today? January 13, it's Greg Weed's lucky day today. The 13th. And what numbers Danny Marino boy? 13. What number was the shirt? The, the, the, a dolphin jersey that Mo was wearing this morning. 13. It's peace day. It is. So peace on everybody. In fact, we don't like a piece. Oh, let's see. What do we got? 13, 99. Oh, come on. You folks can do better than that. I want to get this thing. Schmidt can already. I'm going to grab this thing up. So I'll give you the brand new pool. Okay. Let's take a look at it. Oh, now they're all hopping on it. Well, like I said, hop off of it. Okay. So it'll refresh on it. All right. I guarantee it's for I would look at that 1401. 1411 on the yesterday's pool, which I already give you the numbers. Okay. Here's our first pool today. The second one later. I like a lot. You didn't see it. Did you? No. Good. Second pool later, which we will build. We've never done this one. Don't accuse me of doing this before. We've done. What was your favorite TV show? We've never done this one. What was your all-time favorite TV character? I don't think we have. Not even close. I got two of them here. I know he's going to win. Archie Bunker? Yes. That was the first one I wrote down. And guess what? The second one I wrote down was you won't like. Because I know you wouldn't like it. Frank Cannon. Okay. Never stole it, Frank. We're not. It's just he was bad. I thought he was neat. I thought that William Conrad was great. And he was a fat. And it was silly. The fact that the day I was going to get this thing. And he was a fat. And it was silly. The fact that this fact guy was wobbling around catching all these evil doers. But nevertheless, I just put it on there. There's a starter. Anyway, here's the first poll. There's very important stuff. Everybody get on the edge of your seat right now. Okay. Squat. Drop a big one. What's your take on the den Reno hiring? What's your take? Come on. What's your take? Five choices. See. That's why I love this time. And the same neurotic repetition. Nothing ever changes. You know, oh, no, it's freaking cute. It's won't speak English. You know, that will never change. Pa. I was watching Gaines and New York. And somebody was on the dox. It was in 1890 something. Doesn't anybody speak English and New York anymore? No. And. Oh, I was at the. When? How was I yesterday? Where was I? Oh, it was last night at the track. And a couple of the bus boy guys that are speaking pet twice. A couple of the Haitian guys. They're pet. And then I got this guy at the table across from me who was Italian or we have not agreed over to real Italian. And he's in a pile of my way. They're going to go down. All right. With his. I'm not. I don't like pet. Well, two pasty and. And. And something if there's anybody in this place speaking English. I mean, even making me knuckle a make nickel was speaking in a four language last night. Hey, by the way, Mickey. Christie. Mcnick will drive us better. And you do anyway. What's your take on the den Reno hiring? I smell super bowl. That's the first choice. Huh? I smell super bowl. Can you smell it? Oh, yeah. I like that flavor man. Hey. He cuts the best smelling for it. And here I thought you might be distracted from your humor. No. By what? Court events. I figured it'd be compelling and reflecting. Court events. You mean the mob business? Yeah. I'll get to that. I want to take my time with that. It's too important. I'm not making light of that either. It was a major day in my life and his two. I believe. It really was. All of us. And you ask. I come back up the elevator. I come up here. And they're all running around. This is a, this is a Kenny place. It's a sandbox. It's a bunch of overgrown children. And they're watching on the security monitor. They're watching the summit that Moana had done in a parking lot this morning. It was summit. All right. Huh? No. Everybody. And then of course, Joe Rose. I find I'll talk about a Yenta. I told he's a little bit of a backstabber. I love the little dog. But he's a backstabber. A little bit. He likes twist in there. A little. A little. What did you just say? Nothing. I told him that he ought to be the next one in a hank. Have a sit down. True. Am I right? Absolutely. And I'll say it again. If Greg read if you had any balls at all, if he had any brains at all, which you certainly don't. You haven't been to one to orchestrated this long time ago. We could have cleared the air here. And life could have gone on. We're still playing that little bit. Some were still having a good time. But at least it wouldn't have been all this hate and hostility going on. Yeah. It's no way to run a business. But Greg, we don't know how to run a business. He hasn't got a clue. He's got that bitch back there who's selling like a dollar a holiday. You know, and we guys sell all these, uh, phony, phony spots, all these free mentions, which I noticed the promo today. But that's right. The Sandbar grill in the grove. Excuse me. There's always at least one, you know. Well, they got to be somewhere. Right. Can't just say it. It's such an assistant address. Anyway, I smell super bowl. That's the first choice. It's a PR stunt to pacify dolphins. Danny's a winner. I like it. It won't change a thing or I couldn't give a Schmidt less. Well, that I guess it'll be your vote. Or maybe not. You're a Danny person. You at least know who that is. It's a Danny person. You know who he is. Yeah. Got them funky. Looks like. Like that Joker on restaurants. Got all the restaurants. Resteront, Resteront, Daisy's got the CBS TV gig. He's got the HB TV gig. He's everywhere. Hmm. Still the give a crap. No. But in any way, the true is a lot of fun for QAM. Every time there's another Danny thing. I'm starting to remember that Jimmy Johnson's coming back to replace Dave Ones. They're right before the season starts. Jimmy and Danny, wouldn't that be great? Oh, together again. I love it. Jimmy and Danny, Danny and then we could play those bits over and over again. And they can talk day after day as a Jimmy's fall. Does it Danny's fall? Who sucks the most? Anyway, I haven't even got, I did. I smell super bowl. It's a PR stunt to pacify dolphins. Danny's a winner. I like it. It won't change a thing or I couldn't give a Schmidt less. There's your five choices. Let's hop on that pole, baby. And what am I voting to get this thing started? I'll assure wish that this, see, I don't, this isn't even set up right here. That's why I hate this studio. The studio blows. It's a PR stunt. Oh, the if you think we're paying them all that money. Yeah, he is. He is. I mean, all, all, he, as soon as somebody comes on and dignity like Wayne did yesterday. And then you know that he's trying to cover up the lie. Oh, look at look at all the hosts on there. I just put the pole up and there's already 52 votes on there. Eric just yanked it on there. Oh, I'm telling you, this is a big winner. This is where it's at, man. Don't think that we can evade this. Just because it's a sports thing. It's more than sports. Dan Marina is bigger than life itself in this town. Can we really is? Right. He's he never stole a free train. Danny boy. Right. He's not somebody we dislike on a show. I always like Danny. In fact, it just paid me that these holy freaking fans down here. Oh, well, you know, he's over to Hill and he never won a Super Bowl. He don't have any ring. Yeah, he's got rings all right. Ring around a collar. Okay. 52 votes. It's a PR stunt to pacify dolphins in spite of Wayne's denials yesterday. Twenty one people said that. Danny's a winner. I like it. 12. I couldn't give a Schmidt last 11. It won't change the thing. Six. I smell Super Bowl. I need to. I'm sure one of those is Tony Siggaretto. You're so silly, Tony, an idiot. You're such a silly goose man. I'm so embarrassed. You know, even the news from Buffalo. I don't care what anybody says. It's not, you know, Buffalo isn't a major market. It's a million people. But even the news from Buffalo smells a little bit more professionalism than the newscast we got down here. And I noticed that Steve Wolford on channel four news is long gone now. He was good. He was too professional for here. Just like John Hamburg was too professional for here. But somebody silly, like Tony Siggaretto, who's just a silly sports, a new M nerd, turned news anchor with a gigantic ego. Him and sloppy Velapi. Is she still around? I don't know. You don't watch that channel. No. But our big head is on there. Sure. I saw him yesterday afternoon. I said, there's my buddy Joe Rose. I watched the All Rod Regas news channel. Oh, channel four. Right. Elliott Rodriguez. Mighty Rod Mega Rodriguez. Rodriguez. The Saul Rodriguez. They're all on there. All Rodriguez all of us. By Rodriguez is for me. If things don't work out here, maybe you know, Oh, cool. I'm here. Because as part of the deal with mole, I can't believe it. So there's the initial results on our pull. Let's do the break. Well, no, because I want to like ease into this. I want to give the whole story. After we take a call or two, we'll quickly. Jimmy and Danny line. Hello. Hello. Your search. You're family Reno's shock, buddy. No. Ha ha ha ha ha. Right there is definitive soft Florida, baby. I like it. Oh. Yeah. It's just a jam or Reno sucks, buddy. That's the first response we get here on the new Rogers show. On the one that's supposed to be negative, right? That's right. Although I did vote for I think it's just a PR stuff. Because, you know, he's keeping, he's keeping the ones that which is a bad bet. Even extended his contract. Yeah. Two years with no play offs, man. The guy is strictly Chicago beers we incarnate is just. Kaka. Poop. And what's the other one? Pisten. What else do we miss it? Everybody off. He's pissing everybody off. So, and they still got rich score. Tina now is the new general manager, which is a joke because Rick are ways about 85 pounds. He's divided a carer than he had that nose problem. Oh, okay. Wait, you're not going to believe the response on this poll today. You're going to be a, a astonished. Are they, is it? No, it's a groupable. 87. It's only been on here for like about six or seven minutes. 87. Vote. Maybe the Republicans are freeping it. Well, keep this on till noon and then we'll start. We'll worry about building up the other one. Or maybe we'll say the other one for tomorrow. I don't know. You think we can build it and then do it tomorrow. Whatever you want. No. Then what do we do tomorrow? Because we're not doing that one in two palliatives. Our no more. That's done. That's over. I get my word on that. See where it works. We're making a whole new deal here in 2004 and giving you folks a little mole. Is what we're doing? Because we're desperate. Wait till Friday. We're just, we're just by the time you'll Friday when that book comes out. It's going to be. We a stinker ruin midday. And the rest of the day who the hell knows I have no idea. Could be all kinds of things. Could be really good. Could be. But we'll see. My good friend, Kid Curry was even sniffed around and they're talking about Anna's squeeze big ass. He did make a comment. He did throw in some kind of crack. He came in the middle of a conversation down there and made some kind of a crack about. Oh, yeah. It's just a radio show. Just ask Anna's squeeze. I give her the squeeze. Yeah. She's got a real big ass. And the Kid Curry's into big ass although a little bit younger. I guess these days. It's 27 past 10 am I right? No comment. How old is his misses now, buddy? 18. I think she just had a birthday. 12. Hey, let me tell you something right now.

Can you hear it? Chunks. 168. What's your take on the Dan Reno hiring? It's a PR stuff to pacify. Dolphins. 63. They're not buying it, Goldie. They're not buying it. I was Tom Mo about the Chris Moore story. Right. Remember the months that I was in Limbo or paid not to work. I remember it very well. Oh, so months that packs and paid me off. I didn't. I was talking about Chris Moore on coming on a station. And tell him the bookstore who ever was on with that. They maybe Joe's a gacky. I think I might have been a gacky. And Chris Moore on coming on breathlessly. I don't think he'll Rogers will ever be on WQA. I mean, if he comes on here and starts ripping Wayne, how's it? Can you imagine the very first day? That'll be the end of that. No. See, even more made of very good put that is Wayne doesn't sign our pay text here. Well, he might sign most pay check for the dolphin game. He don't sign line for doing his talk show. Does he sign your check? No. No, he got nothing. He doesn't own a radio station. He's got nothing to do with it. Okay. So, there you go Wayne. We'll say whatever it'll help we want. Chris Moore, is he still on here here? No. Oh, I don't think Chris Moore was ever on this station. You know, something I don't think Chris Moore will ever do the Panther games. I don't think it will ever happen. Do you? I think yel these got a better chance to do in the Panther games than Chris Moore on. Ratt attack. Anyway, sir. Did you ever see Chris Moore and for all together? No, that's a good point. Yeah. Water pipe sir. Ratt attack, sir. See? Yeah. Good boy. I think it's him. I think that's what happened is they found out it was really him in Dragon. That's what they blew money here. 168 votes. What's your tickets? A PR stunt to pass by dolphins 83. I'm not a six. I'm sorry. 63. Danny's a winner. I like it 42. I couldn't give a Schmidt less 31. How many for that? But third man. I won't change a thing 26. I smell Super Bowl six. We're talking Super Bowl because we're the Denmarino Dolphin. Can you see it? Come on. Sure. I can smell it. I'm getting my tickets. And it's right up the street again. In fact, maybe it'll be safe to be a dolphin again. You know, that woman that got ripped on a show Friday. I think that guy was a little bit. I think that was the point she was trying to make. That about the Panther is remember she called in and she said, oh no. Now it's okay to root for the Panthers again because they're playing for you. She was being a little bit sarcastic. I got called and ripped her an ass. Which was fine. Charles and dear field beats on and when you people lay off and when we did the very heavy Do these serious show yesterday and of course now today the big deal is oh a polo nearly you know may have broken the law. I mean, naturally so it's a meteor for you. What can I tell you? As opposed to saying, hey, you need to say we're in this war because we were lied to and I had this plan all along and they just had to make up some grotesque reason and make up a bunch of lies so that you go in there and to kick some ass and to be up the world fields and stuff like that. Yeah. But that's your media for you. Don't air and the only good piece of news is that young people are turning away from mainstream media to get their news. Even Tom Jerka had a combat that this morning about the um not necessarily the new thing. Yeah, more and more young people are not they're they're not the watch and the ABC or CBS or NBC. Apparently there's certainly now watching MSNBC nobody is or even CNN. Nobody under the age of 100 watches CNN including me. Certainly not news internet news. There you go. That's what they do in their turn to the internet. They're going to the arraggers.com to get the MS baby. They're going to something that might tell they're going to like move on.org. Yeah. And they're still there still plan those hit the rats on CNN. They just they just can't get away from that and it quite frankly if they hit any balls they would use those ads. Right? Because those are the ones that are right on. Okay, let me get to the store right after the break. Huh? I think we've dilly deadly that we had a major summit meeting in a parking lot this morning. Perhaps the most implausible unproductive moment in history of this radio state and maybe in the history of the human race I would say. When you say so far. Try to think of what might have come close. I don't know. But I think the bottom line is Greg it's it's your fall baby. Once again the ball be in drop by Greg Reed anybody seen him lately. Oh thank god. Great, man. fooled. Were you lucky? With that he was the cradle Until we all got through And the other has been a water Through the start of the way So here Grab his hand and Diesing Seek and forge and handle them is done He started acting movies Section Stuart, tell me Hand and Empower With his hands andexclamation We're gonna fake the villains Now, now, now, now, just in our water Who's got the fake? I heard the rots you saved I wait to walk in the water I'm gonna wait to see the stairs Who wait and lock the doors If the huddle is in hand time Well I can't found no fear The water still won't stop the way They still hate to walk they like toys They intend to the complexionist courts in South Florida to make them a sticker by the He's a piece of crap and of course even George was just reminiscing about the Marlins in the 1997 A First World Series victory and of course right after the game Oh, I guess what if you don't build a sustainium We're trading off the whole team and then we're like Kevin Brown couple other players. Oh, we'll even play for reduced salary. Why don't we keep the thing going? No, bye bye Panthers if you don't we already played the clip about building the arena and the blah blah blah I won't play there anyway because I don't want to do one thing and they are any is playing there and then he sold it to this Porsche Mach Allen Cohen And he just continues playing for how's that blockbuster stadium doing? Blockbuster park see if Marlins wouldn't have to be running around looking for a stadium If we had blockbuster park we have it to get built. No, was it a big fat line? Yeah, wow, and how is the people still all that blockbuster stock, you know what a tier in his eye was Miramar's fault See I can't I can't handle ultra rich people I can't stand them Yeah, because nothing is there they never have enough they never stop dicking with people they never stop screwing around with people's emotions You know just take all your money and go away already. Well, yeah, I'm not in the sports business to offer the fans I'm in to make money. Well screw you man It's a reason they're called filthy even though he has nothing to do with blockbuster anymore. He left such a a taint on that establishment That there are a lot of people that won't go there just because he was involved in it. In fact most people think he's still involved in it Right a taint and it's like let's just tell me he is Oh, Wayne's gonna be a blockbuster tonight. I think he's got something to do with it Anyway, in fact, here's a fact that says all I gotta get to my Howard story or baldy went off on a big old because he was asked a question that was correct Not the big old that's Salmando. He's got his fixed confused. He's got Orlando Elzacuiri mixed up with the Amandoza Azel Gwiri whatever his name is Dan is a pitchman great quarterback never coached by the way what does Dan know about the auto business except how to buy a bunch of cars Also how much is a gazillion dollars anyway And that's what Wayne said yesterday I saw the press conference. He's making a gazillion dollars over there at CBS, HBO. What does he need to come here to it? You know Anyway, it says it's kind of ex-dolphin fan Balldy is a joke is what he says. How do you like that pick it on the Wayne mice? You again good nice going wherever you are ex-dolphin Then here's another fact that says Any excerpt from any QM sports show from now to logist host hello WQM collar Dave and Danny Danny and Dave and Ecoson for like whole paragraph A host I see your point, but I think they've been Danny. David Danny and Ecoson for like another program It says host before I take next call I have to do depending on which show it is. Oh, I see You're picking out most head again. Okay, cut the crap. Well this was written before they heard the story. That's right. So anyway, here's the story Get on the edge of your seat, okay? So I drive into the parking lot this morning into my lovely parking spot there And I see off to the side there by where those benches are I see Moe is over there with Giri Sarner to my very favorite people And I get out of the car take my little briefcase here as they're waddle into a door and Giri Sarner, hey Neil, how you doing? Hi, Giri and Moe looks at me and he said I forget what the first word was at you. That's no that was on the very first word Oh, because when I was driving in he said something about The Zach story again. He puts that on here with that story as if we can't let that go already and they said something about well It's better what that cancer we have on the irritant of classes so anyway He made some Grow test comment to admit so as I started to go in the door I said, well, you know cancer might be contagious mole Which is this my response is coming about me being a cancer and he said to me F you feel you And I looked at him and I said well back at you and he said few big round you walk on Never do that If I could find a mole hole Yeah, and anyway And so thank you're he Sarner kind of got up and started getting nervous and doing the same by his dance and kind of waddling through the door So most of them will come over here and tell me something. I said tell you what I mean I don't want repeat the whole conversation But in other words, it started out extremely hostile as as you'd expect and Then he said well and I said to my said well, what is it that I've said about you that isn't correct you said on the air Wow, I named it you know when he went out air so we'll give me something specific So he decided that we were gonna have a why guess it was mutual, but it was I still say 70% him and about Percent me that we ought to sit down and like have a meeting of the minds and he said sit down Just like that sit down. There's two benches out there right I said what you sit down to so we both sat down And we broke out of a lonely sandwich no and Why you know the Jews and We got into a thing about this one did this and this one did that and I said, well, you know I wanted to have a discussion like this year ago in November But Greg Reed of course is always too busy and he's got corporate meeting and he's got this and he's got to go Wipe his ass and he's always got some excuse why doesn't do these things and He told me that he had agreed to it Which I think is what we heard right right? We did but of course Greg wasn't gonna facilitate it Of course Clarence and Duff there are a couple of quizlings men are couple of pansies Oh gee Greg it's a fight. It's a fight. You know, and that's what happens when you run a place like this the way Greg does is that nobody else has got any authority Because he's got to be he's all got to come back to Greg Even silent for like paper clips and toilet paper. That's why there's no pity cash here. Did you know that? No, I didn't see only radio station I've ever only business ever been in my life. It doesn't have pity cash. That's petty. Yeah Because you know he's got he has to have and the funniest part about that I guess that empowers him, you know because he can't write a check All the checks have to come out of Naples probably because they don't trust him Possibly know they got a bunch of degenerate gamblers working here too. So anyway to make a long now Well, that's not a good idea to let people I check the check books, you know We need to have people that are compulsive gamblers then they try to start covering like citing checks, you know Cover this a bed and cover night bed Call him this bookie so anyway to make a long story a longer We had a meeting of the minds and a yeah and and mow very Honestly admitted that he had done some really grow test things like the bulletin at headcomment and apologize for it. I accepted it And that doesn't mean we're gonna be best of friends who that we like have some kind of a love fest But the fact that a matter is the uglyness stops here To quote somebody from our favorite movie cook was nest I play an all right thing, but that's in there now What's in there the all right drought I played all right drought We don't need any sound effects for this. This is serious. This is a kind of a joke. All right Th wrong with you My brains are going top and so anyway I said that he probably ought to have the same kind of a sit down with Hank and also with Joe Rose Now I know it'd be on the shadow of it and I told him this I said a part of the audience is in my audience anyways Gonna be very upset that doesn't mean we're not gonna continue playing a poker Brian bits There's nothing malicious involved in any of those there there. It's humor. It's a radio show and I told him that again I think he understands that finally Good, but I mean there's a difference between shit And Reading malicious crap and it just has gotten to the point of being so ugly around this place and now that I'm back here for a couple of ways I think it needs to stop and if we had any any kind not just this constant absentee management Any emotional cripple that keeps running away and running away and hiding from the problems Instead of doing something to solve them and bring people together That's the main problem of QA. It's not Howard David. It's not your rod Is not Hank or berg it's not anybody else. It's not even that obnoxious beast. It's Greg Reed You don't know how to run a business baby. You don't know how to talk to people and the reason he's uncomfortable in doing that is because he can't do it He doesn't come and say to me, you know, and it's like that He called to tell me that he was firing your ass I'm in Toronto. I answered a phone about two fifteen. Oh, Neil. It's a Greg A congratulations on a great book. Oh, and by the way, I've decided terminate the George Rodriguez Kind of like an afterthought. I said. I don't think so I don't think so And I don't want to rehash all of that too because that was in our repirit That's what started this whole thing with mo But that's the way Greg deals with problems. He cannot I mean it just like a couple of times when a game came so frustrating That I had a call on at home, which I've done maybe three times and then the six years I've been here Plus before we started what I talked about the other day about the studio won't be ready. It's said right so on I mean when you continue digging yourself into a deeper and deeper and deeper hole and lying and lying and He's fading and just like that first show we did on the year after all at history Trying to get the studio built downstairs and he takes his whole family and runs off on a plane to Chicago Hoping just crossing his legs and fingers and eyes just praying that maybe by some miracle We'd actually get to show on here from that studio the next day and keep in mind in those days We weren't even on the air from the studio. They they had a we were going through like by remote Because the the transmitter was over the other joint We had a dial up after we had a dial everything up every day and hope that the phone system would work And of course like even now nothing worse. We came in here this morning and I love our mob room with being an asshole and Changed the passwords and access to all the everybody's computer and the building Everything's an I'm here again But this is the beastly effin way and you can blame Greg Reed you can blame the beastly's But the fact is this is the way they do business they don't pay people in the timely fashion They don't want to cut loose with all the cash they're making they got a bunch of little dictators like Bob vermuth He's got a big ego problem. You know well, we're gonna do it this way and you're not gonna do this and you're not gonna do that Remember the idea we had of doing like an hour on the internet Yeah, well, no, I I think of that time when the a transmitter went out when Ferrell was going to be doing this for a show and he and I didn't I were so on the internet using every word that's ever been invented That was maybe the most entertaining arts ever been on this later station. It was great radio, but it wasn't on the radio But it was on the internet people were listening we got a lot of you be surprised how many people we got Listened out there in the internet at least and people loved it and so we had that idea Wow, we're not gonna do that true because our QM might be responsible and but if you put them up But I'm with you know Which is which is why we don't even have a link anymore on a QM website for the new Rogers website because somebody made a big Timis about the fact we had something on there that was a sub-roso. It was this whatever it was and so they came in right away They always came in that's why Ferrell and here no more because they always came in That's the nature of this place big big aspirations They want to be this and they want to be that but they don't have they don't have the guts to do it. That's the problem And we don't even have the guts to look somebody in a face never real conversation with him And what kind of management is that? It's miss management fact that could be the new name we have for Greg miss management Then we got the junior miss management We could have a page it. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking We got junior miss over there. We got junior miss over here. We got a couple of juniors Yeah Oh, yeah, we'll have a page in it's the junior mismanagement page in a QM I like it. Yeah, we're gonna said that other pull for tomorrow. I'm on a roll now Plus I want to hear all these a Danny and Dave and Jimmy and Danny calls. Why should we why should we pee on their parade? There are such a roll now. Why should we interrupt in the beginning? It's one thing after goes on for about six to seven months And I have to intercede and say hey, these guys are getting a little bit carried away to sports shows Like I did with a Jimmy and Danny think it's getting really a few in ponderous Okay, what's your take on the Dan Marine or hiring this is the big story 286 votes in about 35 minutes Is that shocking or what it is talking we could just go through the roof on this thing today Which is already go with the flow flow I think when that's unfriety we're gonna hit the flow when at bookmza a lot of people are gonna hit the flow including us 26 votes what's your take it's a PR stunt to pacify doll fans 106 Danny's a winner. I like it's 78 that's 27.2 percent I couldn't give it Schmidt less 54 it won't change a thing 37 and I smell super ball 11 Smell super ball That's Owen Nolan's number.

We got managed to do the Lotus 4 with our own, it wouldn't have been 4 to 5. And by the way, every year, good guy, but your voice is terrible. The big summer clock tonight.

Go ahead of your company. Oh, I'm sorry. I was so bad. I'm thinking ahead about two years. Chairman 34 votes. It's a PR stunt to pacify dolphins. 116. 34.7% think you're a liar Wayne. And Spidey or chew it out Orlando, Quirria, is the Gizegiri. Then he's a winner. I like it 84 25.1% I couldn't give a Schmidt list over 20% 68. It won't change a thing 53 15.8% I guess because they got the same coach and they got Rick's Quirria Tino's GM now. And I smell Super Bowl. Look what the number is. Do you see an Oman? 13. Wow. All right. 13. Can't see the number. Well, I can. Why not? Because your computer is a piece of crap and it's not working. 13. What a percent say. We're smell and Super Bowl because it's Danny Moreno. So that's 28.9%. This is quite a day. We got Dan Moreno is the assistant, Cheekook and bottle washer with the dolphins. We got Mo and Neil have a summit in the parking garage down here in a parking lot. And the kids should make up and shake hands. And that's not a publicity stunt by the windside. It just happens spontaneously. And I'll say again, I give him 70% of the credit and I'll take my credit. And I really do think you ought to have a like a sit down with the big dog with Joe who's a good guy. And with the hopper was a great guy, right? On the stairs. Like I said, with Joe who's a great guy and Hank was okay. Even without. Okay. There you go. No, I don't play favorites. They're all good guys. That's pointed out to Mo. I get along with everybody here except up until the day except him. So I don't like it. Is there anybody else? I'm not talking about salespeople or those kinds of people or management. I'm talking about like mad dog. Oh, the hell. We got right with for a few. Joe Rose. Love Joe. The Humper. Any K. Joe and Mark. Right on. Even the big. The big. The big. And already said Hank. The big. Right. Oh, and he. Here's the ever company. And said, you need to always rip me on here. He never said that. Who Hank? No, the big. Oh, I don't rip Hank on here. I've had some fun in his expense. But he understands. He gets it. Some fun in his expense. Oh, no. And his pants. There's an expense in his pants. In fact, he's that's why he was not last week. I have all his pants. Let up. And then come on. Now I'll see him one of these days while I'm here. I'm looking at on the schedule. I see he's in studio next couple of days in today. So I wanted to the Humper. In fact, I might stick around extra one of these days just to make sure we can bond a little bit. And I can take a look and see just how expensive. I don't know what to say. Because I if I told you what I wait in my scale this morning, you would just get up and walk out. No, I used to it. And what do I tell you every time I come back here? You know, because there's nothing else. I'm here to track last night. Right. And just eaten. It's another meal I would've had it all. Now you saw what I had here this morning. I had my interest. I bet it could stay good stuff. That's my breakfast. Going to mommy's for lunch. He's going to try to force feed me and sit there. Oh, you're so fat. Who's the same way? Well, she's pushing right. Right. And that's all that is why I'm here. And the pony tail wants to be in food. This one wants me to go weed here. And I can't do it. Can I do it? Can I do it? Federal diabetic meal? Can't do it. Okay. And now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to let these people. I'm going to save that other pull for tomorrow because yeah. Yeah. Because that'll, that's great to kill tomorrow. Always plan ahead. And number two, the audience is just pent up with the motion about all this. About Wayne, about Danny, about the whole insanity this whole thing. About my summit with more. We just got too many fish to fry today. Hmm. Yeah. That's the old fish fry. 50670560 pound pile 60 on the AT&T. We're doing screenless by the way.

I can smell when there's something to be exploited. I mean really pushed when the audience is on fire. This town is smaller in man. When you achieve something, you got everybody talking again. Now what they're saying, you're probably not going to like because you're a hard ass. You know what I love the best about people with a lot of money. I give up thin skin. Oh. Steinbredder. Big still swing. They're all real thin skin. Are you said that about me? Well shame on you. You know that kind of crap. What would you care? Exactly. I mean I know, you know, I make a couple of bucks, but I certainly not a multi-millionaire. But I don't give a crap on anybody's say. But more importantly, are you wearing that shirt again today? Because you liked it so much yesterday. You're right. I wear shirt two days. Do you? Yeah. Okay. I don't sweat a lot. I don't do any like a manual labor. Man well labor. I wear shirt two days. That's fine. Is that okay? That's fine. Now if I wore it again tomorrow, you said to me why you wearing that day. Then I'd say, well, because I'm becoming a slob in my old age. In fact, you know, if it'll make you happy, what I'll do is I'll wash it. I'll put it in the, although this, you can't put this in the wash again. Just got to do it. I don't know. Probably okay. Oh.

But not that I mind it's put on way too old. I fantasize about feeling bad to do. In a trist with feet low my man friend is in it. I'll just make up with ginger and something. And then ask him to break my bun. Now there you know the again. So I would not feel the most old. And I would not be ashamed about a ginger and more gay union. Just hold him and stroke him away. Boy make a weird that my guy just sounds like a lion year old kid. Only a macho men like him. You don't know this. That makes me flip my wig. If ginger was a lover of mine I'd bury my bulbous mani no. Insight is simply re-written. Did it to the day. Now I would not be a sport old. Now if I was not a clown to the face that's why a ginger and more gay union would make me feel guilty and gay. Oh my, follow my thousand balls. Yeah ginger and more gay union. That would make my sorrow pony ass kill safe. If we had a ginger and more gay union. And he would have to get me raped. I think that's a big news story in a market today not the Danny and Jimmy and Jimmy and Danny and Wayne and Dave's story. But nevertheless what do I know? Three hundred eighty votes on here in a little bit less than an hour. George we're going to get right around 400 in a first hour staggering. It is unbelievable is what it is. And the way yeah as David Paul would say even Dan Paul might say it. What's your take on the Dan Marino hiring? What's your take? It's a PR stunt to pass if I do offense. How are 29 and 33 and about a third say that? You turn. Danny's a winner. I like it. 99 26 percent. I couldn't give a shipment last 77 20.2 percent. It won't change a thing 59 15. And I smell super bowl. We're talking super bowl because it's Tony segretto 16 people. And he's such a silly ass. I hate to say that because your roles near probably pretty tight. Because they're like sports nerds. 16 people say they're smelling super bowl. Chris they didn't say for which team. I'm smelling super bowl for no wait. But again. WQA. GD hear that? That was good. WQA and hello. Hello. Yes sir. Is QM? Sounds like me. That's real. Yes sir. McIllum Wayne. Yes a lot of people. Feel that way. 567. 0560. 556. 18. And Verizon Wireless Line. WQA. Yes sir. I just thought about it. I want to do it. WQA. Hello. Yes sir. Is. Since you may piece with more is Josh now sit down with more to or not. Is George going to sit down with most of his life? Is he on his life? He's going to be like a good. Paul Winshal and Jerry Mahal. He's the one who's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. He's going to be on his own. Am I right? Okay. But it's a radio show. And everything is lightened up several degrees. And we've got an understanding. Oh, speaking of we got an understanding like the Bishop said in the Godfather 3. No, no, no, I got this story. Where is it? The church review of whether woman Catholic Bishop started doing enough to prevent sex abuse show that at least 150, incredibly accused priest had moved out of their dies. These raising words that offenders are living unsupervised in places where most people are in a wrong thing about them. Among those 150 priests, auditors learned that 10 clergymen had left the country, some returning to home die-sees overseas, at least for them, couldn't even be found. The wereabotes of the rest of the group are known to church leaders. And the reports said that where possible, there should be a hand comply with the new policy and send confidential notices to the priest new die-sees that they got like a pervert hanging out there. But victim advocates say that sending a private letter was enough that church is leading potentially dangerous offenders roaming around unsuspective communities they see. And I think they are- That's the little bit correct. But what do I know? Let's see, now here's one message. I just wanted to say hi. I'm your nice Jewish friend. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She doesn't stop doing that, you know? She? Yeah. She's married to a- Yeah, whatever her name is. Oh, yeah, let's do it. She's married. Jewish. Suzanne, you don't have to keep doing that every 10 to 70 effects. It's a cute fact with goofy looking under his ass. It says anyway, I hate all Florida teams including the dolphins. It's about who is a richer and who is screwing up stupid. Oh, who is screwing who? Well, okay, whatever you say Suzanne, just calm down. She always starts out. I mean, you're a Mexican friend. Mary did a Jewish guy in home said, just say it's Suzanne. I'll know who it is. Suzanne. We've only got just a few women listen to them anyway. About 30 minutes. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line. And that's our question today for this South Florida audience. What's your take? And who'd like to take a shower with Dan Moreno? Joe Rose, as you'll have to push him out of the way first. No, you're smiling. They still hang it out together. They do. Think they hot tub it. They air it out. WCOM. Yeah, good morning, Neil. Just like Molina air it out on our differences. Yes, sir. Thank God, man. Nobody's putting the war over the dolphins fans. Right. Wow. Yeah, that was good today. Hey, they're going to be great man. This town is just bursting with energy. This is the best thing that happens is the Inventa Hall of Law. Since they started selling to Lupas on South Beach. WCOM. WCOM. WCOM line line line. There's nobody on there. WCOM. Hello. WCOM. Hello, Uncle Neil. Yes, sir. Okay. Where in this country can you get the image from news? Is there anything that actually gives you the MSBs? What does that mean? I'm just saying, what can you actually get the truth of them going on the internet? I'm being online. You will see BBC or BBC, but only if you got to get those on your directee and your disher whatever. It's amazing because I speak a piece of the mic. I have all those time. There's so many people who are just a brainwatch. No, no, anything that's going on. You can't even hold it in the television conversation. Of course, not the polo and Neil thing should have been one of the biggest bomb in the world. And instead, they come up with a set of feeding the media this crap about, well, maybe he broke the logs or felony this class of undocumented. And nobody's even talking about what he said. So why? You know, I'm not going to keep farting into the window or rest of my life. I did the best I could yesterday. I played the 60 minutes piece. And that's it. And nobody really cares. So, screw him. People really don't. And it's a shame because it's just the matter of time before it all blows up and half face again. But I hope this ruin went off across the board. And next year for a couple more people. Okay, well, we'll make a special invitation for you. Thank you, sir. Good luck to you. 409. And Beast Boys are really proud of that in one hour, George. We got 409 votes. That's real fine. 409. Well, that's where we draw the line. No, just keep phone on there, baby. What's your take because we're going to send this to Wayne and show him that thank God the dolphin fans aren't getting the wool pulled over their eyes. It's a PR start to pacify dolphins, the hiring of Danny Boy 140. 34.2% that number is rising Wayne. They're not buying it. All this crap about well, he wouldn't give up all that money just to be a figurehead. Uh-huh. Danny's a winner. I like it 107, 26.1%. I couldn't give a Schmidt less. 81. It won't change the thing 62. And I smell Super Bowl 19. We're talking supercosets the important stuff. Super Bowl, I'm ring. Everybody's got to have that ring. Grab on the old brass ring and hold onto your thing. 4.6%. So when you had the two positive ones together, look what you got to it. 3.9%. Almost 31% say hey, this just smells pretty good. Well, let me smell it again, Danny. 5.670. 5.6. WQAM. 1. 10. 10. 1. WQAM. 1. 10. WQAM. 1. 8. OK, sir. Are we blessing this time? We got them. We got them. We know and Neil and Mom made up. And what more could you want? We're blind. We're blind. I went Sunday to the three Kings Parade and I went to the three Queens Parade myself. I got a four year old son and then they was just a politics fest. And you know who came down the street, Ilia and the Roth Letterman. I went to wave them my son and I got to him shoot a party. And he shot her a birdie and you should have seen her lift just clicked. Good for him. I say he's the next mayor of Miami man. Absolutely correct. I'm not sure what the real thing is. I don't know what the real thing is. I don't know what the real thing is. But we have to be clear we have to be clear. I just love God. Thank you everything. I'm forks on the renal back. Praise Jesus. Absolutely. All right. In fact, what's that line about. About bush. Which one. The one with boka brown. Wreys says praise bush like Jesus. Praise Danny like Jesus. George was saying before to show that maybe we ought to have like a church. Church of the dolphin. Sure. Church of the dolphin and we can have a gigantic city that big statue of myrre or whatever. Right, you can have Shula on the crucifix. Shula, Shula. Oh, and then they heard something. Call this one was it this morning or last night. I'm going to go to the track. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah, it was last night called eddy k. By the way, any hangs up on everybody. That's the reason I like him. He hangs up on everybody. Good. But then, of course, he's only got the same for cranks. But he hangs up on home. But anyway, he had somebody same. You think Shula's coming back now? I mean, Shula, the shoes might be coming. Yeah. Yeah. And Danny and Donna, whatever. And he just turned 96. I got a look for something else to do. I'm sure, like maybe you have somebody changed your bag, don't. The brain stem. Wouldn't that be something? See, this is the dolphin situation. Let's keep going back in the past. In fact, how about Danny and quarterback next year? Yeah. He's going to be giving all that money, as well. He can like run up into the stands before the game and make all the decisions. And race down there through the entrance on the field with standing Go, patient. Here comes number 13. Damn, we know. Huh? They should just be permanent since they're not going to win anyway. I mean, I think when they put that statue in front of the stadium, and with the first time that a statue was ever built to it for a statue. One minute and a half. Here's the course we need to find 60. You a m. Kick the bat dead, whitt sniffing glue. He goes on a rastrogal and bark. Ooooo! Mounting off the walls and a real hat group. He goes on a rastrogal and bark. Fuck! He goes on a rastrogal and bark. He goes on a rastrogal, fuck! He goes on a rastrogal and bark. I'd roam from God, ate for lent or rotten. He goes on a rastrogal and bark. Florked in and papa didn't eat galactic气. He goes on a rastrogal and bark. Oh Oh Under the rug is where the stories go in He to the rush struggling Fuff Amid controls so they can fit in holding He to the rush struggling Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff Fuff of the day? You know what? You've gotten 20,000 calls on it. I have, yes. That had several scenes that paved the inane mentality of my Miss Sports Hole radio. The movie is at Best Media, okay? And if I told you who started in or worked a screenplay for the movie, you'd read no for a very. Oh, the Rascal House of Print Media, Dave Barry, who's syndicated. Even he syndicated all around the world. They print that crap. He, I might've been a sad again. My waste my time. Anyways, there are two separate scenes where two him and from out of town are sticking out their quarry from a parked rental car in the Gables while listening to a sports show. They stability to other quizzically as the deforest-esque host and a gator fan carry on a ponderous juvenile argument. 560 AM is clearly displayed on the radio's tuner as they switch it off in the scust. Oh, right. I'll shame on him. That part was funny only because we work here. Right. So two or three times during the movie, every time they pop at on it, the exact same conversation. Right. That was cute. I see. Jimmy and Danny, Danny and Jimmy. They be and Danny. That's our poll question today. I think we'll change the poll at noon. And we'll ask, I'll create another poll. I'll send Erica's different second poll about the Emo in the over union. Okay. Well, I mean, don't you think that's an equal of what's your great importance? What's your take? Right. We ought to do a whole series of asking you what I think is more important. Oh, I knew that's right. I've got the thing in your case. Not even a contest. But I will say this. We've really struck a raw near here at Nerva. And you've 445 in just slightly over an hour. They're smoking about this man. They're smoking the good stuff right now. Roll it up in the Harold. By the way, you'll get cancer if you do that. What's your take on the Dan Reno hiring about the dolphin organization? 445 big fat juicy votes in fact. I know it's going to change on me again. So like I said, 400 and 52 votes. See they're coming in chunks. It's a PR. And by the way, people think, well, that's not really a lot of votes on those polls every day. If we didn't have the AOL problem, we'd have thousands of votes every day. Right. Now, let me ask you this. Seriously. Why is it? Well, really when you compare the number of votes we get, other would not talk a nationwide or worldwide like CNN stuff like that. But would like other local polls, even like newspaper polls, we kick ass. Sure. Yes. We put them to shame. Even though I was reading the New York Post poll one day after, well, that's New Yorkers 15 million people. They're, you know, it was like it was in the middle of the day. And bear in mind that I know. I'm a man who would be under votes on it. And many of those other polls that you're talking about, they don't have the kind of safeguard that we have to prevent people from voting twice. Right. So people can just click on it multiple times and still they have less of a result. I see. Anyway, 450 to just over an hour, the people are really forming about this. It's a PR start to pass by dolphins. 145. 32% almost a third of the audience. You turn. Then is a winner. I like it. 119. Let me lick his pits. I couldn't give a shit less 94. It won't change the thing. 74 and I smell Super Bowl 20 were smelling Super Bowl because 560, 0560, pound 560 on the eighth and 10. And Verizon, I remember that the one year and there was Tony cigarette out there doing his little cheerleading thing. We're talking Super Bowl. They had a whole special thing on the channel six. Did they win the Super Bowl? No, they go to the Super Bowl. No, no, did they come close? Oh, well, there's line nine. It's always a hoot. WQIM. Hi, Neil. Yes, man. I'm sorry caught me off guard. I just wanted to tell you that I'm a woman that listens to you every single day. And yeah, and the only reason that the women don't call so much is because we're busy working. We got things to do. Yeah, I've only one of them is not filling out arbitrine diaries. No, because we don't have any women listening. So they say, okay, well, I'm definitely one of them. Every day I listen to you. Also, I just wanted to tell you that my mother listened to you and I met you in the early 80s. I'm sure that'll make you feel very good. And I love listening to you very old. I know, I'm sorry. But you know, you're raising generations of listeners here. And I like to listen to you. Our, she always says a good job when you're gone. And I appreciate you reading the news. It's always very interesting. Okay. Have a great day. And back to you. Bye, bye. Probably the good calls are my line nine. What's it a while? What's in a blue moon? Five, six, seven, five, six, what's your take? Come on, folks. Here's your chance. Give it a shot. We got a shot. W to Q a. And hello. That's real stuff. W to Q a. Hello. Yeah, but Marine are running the dolphin. There's like a play by a guy trying to do a morning show. Oh, no. See they just wanted to lie. They won't let sleeping hogs lie. Bastard. W to Q a. Hello. W to Q a. M. Hola. Okay. W to Q a. Hello. And don't yell. Are you okay? Another woman that listens to you religiously. Now, one ever sends me any arbitrar on things. The fire is nothing. Are you speaking wrong language for that? Well, yeah, good point. But I just wanted to say, listen, every single day I've listened for the day today. Just love you. And it's the seven sound like schmoozing too much. Could I possibly get a shooting list request? Maybe. Sugar shockers. Sure. Okay. Seven really great day. You got it. Go that. Yeah. Like, Oh, shouldn't I say, you got it. We'll have another inquisition. Yeah. Clarence still has to come in here. Well, so to complain about that. Well, he blow it out to your ass. Clarence grow up already. Wait, you overgrown the quizling. He is just really bugging me. How could he be the program director of a major market radio station? Spoons. He said to silly goose. All I guess he's, uh, you know, he's got the inside track. Back to him. W to Q a. M. Hello. Hey, first day I like to say, all the women that are calling you are probably fat Harry Carp and Munchers. How do you know that? I just thought. Oh, anyway. Could be by doubt it. The thing that I don't know, you're not fat. And Harry. I. The thing that you want to see off the right now. I think. We're a pipe smoker. Go ahead. The thing that pisses me off the most. He's rising. Every time he's on TV, rising, rising, Oh, Wayne Wayne, baldy. Yeah. Right. He's always talking to you like a stern father. Right. He's always lecturing. Wayne, I. Wayne Wayne. Yeah. Right. The only event that I would ever pay to see from him is to see him being beaten with a rubber hose by the custodian from the pier 60 60 ohms or Alan fun. That was great. I pay for that too. Oh, man. Let's give them on Candid Camera right away. That's the thing. I'll let up. That's beautiful. Why is everybody so hostile with Alan fun? What do he ever do? That's just that one guy. Adam, that's his thing. Oh, it's him. Yeah. They are. Not just him. I've had other people. It's him. Well, he leases got his own thing. Okay. At least he's got his own thing. Okay. At least he's original. Something different. Okay. And plus the guy's dead anyway. So he doesn't give a crap. 21 till noon at 5 60 WCM. How's Katrina doing? Are we going to see her? Oh, he's good. What? We're got to run her down. Yes. Well, run her down the the Sanctanone and get her ass on a scale. And am I. Here. The parking lot. Part of the same. She lost 15 pounds because I'm sure she's lost more than that on balance for life. And you can do the same. And of course, during the holidays, everybody I speak to. And as is well, during the holidays, I packed on eight pounds. I'm not what I mean enough with that already. It's bad. Not only is it look bad or you've fed as a cow. But it's unhealthy too.

The line and law. This is course way of 5 6. You way. Yeah. Even though the x-wife a record producer, Phil Spectre, and said nothing but me, a hateful thing for the past 29 years. The former runnet has apparently changed her tune. Oh, child. I mean, to tell you, this is a good man. Even though Phil kept me locked up in the basement and fed me nothing but race in our skills. If I got there, even though he beat me when it finished in my life, when it's choked here like canvas, hot hot converse makers. That's a good man. I don't believe he can't let anybody. These are way though purpose. But wait, I'll be a parent at a late childhood movie on New Year's Day. In a lobby from Street Hill Park. I'll be singing VMA VMA VMA VMA VMA Lil Baby. Woo child. I still got the pipes. It's a charity show to benefit me. And of course, this was for the children. There's a pretty good chance my friend, Eddie Money, may swing by. The LTRI to take me home today. Oh, I scared myself, but my mother is boy. Anyways, these choices against my ex-husband, it's fully home, home, home, home. Show he tried to kill me once, but not by his own self. He hired a kill man. That's totally different. We had a different agreement about me on the E.P. Fixie Fix instead of sour skittles down in the basement. And he flew off the hammer and hired a kill man. I was bruised, but not died. Incontutions, let me say this. Failed back up, but in the spot my hand. Until not proven innocent by a jury of 12 people who don't like his 2 pay. I blame Palmer Cotney for this incident. For putting out the naked album and taking all the hard work by my ex-spel and leaving it off the regular down on the floor. That's Cuckah, that's Pupu, and it drove until a killin. That he didn't do. I must go back to Morrow. Ronnie Spectre's opinion is not necessarily with what those of any right-taking person medication during the interview provided by Bristol Miners Webb. You know, 14 till noon at 5.60 W.C.M. So I got the new pull finger down here. But I'd say that this is pressure packed today. Who would have thunk it? I know people who say that. Who would have thunk it? But who would have thunk it? Yeah. That's a sports thing, isn't it? Who'd have thunk it? You know who used to say that D.F. I got it with me. I heard a little bit of D.F. yesterday during a break in our hangar. I was sitting in the parking lot at the Pompatopark. Waiting for February to shut up a momentarily. They're after. And there was D.F. On there. And he sounded just like D.F. Never stole a freight train. Well, he never stole a freight train. Okay. The Indians didn't have any freight trains. He might have taken one. Just with freight. He's all right. 510 votes on the D.F. What's your take on the Danny Boy pool? And then we're going to change it at noon. Here's the new pool. I'll give it to you right now. Give you a heads up. Heads up. What's your take on the new boat? I'll take on the Neil and more reunion. If you missed this story, I don't have time to repeat the whole thing. I'll just later on give a thumbnail sketch of what happened in the parking lot this morning. Totally unexpected. Totally unscripted. Totally unanticipated, especially after the rather frosty beginning. The rather frigid beginning of our meet. Yeah, your meet supposed to be frigid before you hang in the meat locker. It was a little on the cold side. There were a few F bombs thrown around. I got to play that. That's my favorite bid. Did you put that in your hope? F bomb. It's not in there. Oh. Yeah, you didn't bring it. Oh, no. I'm going back. This is not a real, this is only like a lady. I believe Neil Rodgers show here. You tell me what? They don't send the stuff here. Well, why not? They have to do it. But you have to go stand and you have to get it. They don't send it. They don't send it. Period. Maybe they don't like you. Maybe they know that Toronto is where it's asked. Oh, the weather is really cold again. Next couple of days. That's a good news for you. That's a good news for Josh. So we don't have to sit in there. Now, what does he do during this time when I'm here? This Josh Cortis. This? When I'm here. Oh, when he's got the web internet, the other, What is a QM website? Oh, that's the promotion stuff. His other duties. He does. He does. He's like the promotion assistant as he always has been. So he's got a few more hours doing the board here. What happened to the re-managed? Oh. Oh. Let's see. Fill across. Bricks is I have no, I have a well. And I've no problem with the polls. Well, that means that nobody else in your block is got it. Right. Oh, I guess it is voting before she does. In other words, she might be the whole springs as she. He. Boy. Fill a lot. He's a little confused. Fill. He's under a lot of stress. Yeah, if somebody you're like within about a six block radius of you votes on our pool, That's why we have a limited, I don't understand why, though. Well, and I do understand because they well sucks because they don't have enough, Bandwidth or whatever. They funnel various clients through the same trunk as it were trunk. I'm sure there's a technical type of thing. I said I could take the A well people and put them in a big trunk with Luca Bratzi. Because they suck A well sucks. Make no mistake of yours for your grandma. Right. A well is for like old-futty, dirty people. Nobody with any kind of a brain uses A well. Have a couple of friends at you, ZA well, but they mean well, even children laugh at it. Right. That's right. Little kids, little five-year-old kids with their first PC in between, look at it, then, Poor no, sorry, ZA. Say, oh, you're on A well. They giggle. They hear a lot. That's because they're looking at the Poor no, sorry. What's your take on the Neil and Mori Union? I got six choices, okay. Wow. I'm shocked, but please. I'm shocked, but this made. I don't give a Schmidt. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I want he get recognized. I wrote that for my own benefit. We don't need the M in Schmidt. It's great for QAM. Great reason to them this long ago or who's Mo. What? I think I covered all the bases. I like to cover all the bases from A to Z. Because they say that in Canada. Yes. They say that. I got to tell you very funny story about that. I'm on a phone with, um, what the hell airline was it? Maybe it was your Canada. I'm doing one of those frequent flyer deals, you know? And they wanted the number. And the last letter, it was like something something A Z. Or you said Z. And I said Z. Then they fast me the confirmation of it. And it's like they put A, B or something. Anything but Z, right? Something Ryan would Z. And when I call back to correct it, because I want to make sure they I got credit for the frequent flyer miles. They said, oh, you mean it's six A Z? I said, oh, yeah. Yeah, Z. That's what I say. That's what I say. I don't think man. The connects were like the British thumb for so long under the thumb. So they say Z. That's cute. Then I'm on the line with the North West or something KLM. And the North West of course is in the US. And I said Z. And they, uh, what you just said? I said Z. And they were seeing red. They went to Africa. And when that's going to be the poll at noon. Now that we got well over 500 votes on this. I think we got the definitive answer on this. The Danny pool. This town is smoking about it. 500 and how many? But 30 minutes. 530 votes Georgian an hour and a half. Staggery. It is amazing. That's more votes in Georgia. It's on his pulls in a month. 530 votes. What's your take on the Dan marino hiring? I remember that. I thought that hanging. He's hung. It's a PR start to pass if I doll fans. 168 31.6%. Wayne's going to come your house and beat you up if you don't change your mind. Would you change your mind? No. Oh, Danny's a winner. I like it. 27. See, I don't even know what that means. I heard people call him and say that Danny's a winner. Well, he's not playing, though, see. And what he was? He was a winner. Okay. Not a Super Bowl winner. Oh, a winner. Well, he don't have that ring. And that's what Wayne says. Now that we want to strike line that was. Well, I'd like to see him. Maybe get a Super Bowl ring this way. Like through the back door. Maybe he could order one. I think when he said to the back door, I imagine. Back them. I couldn't give a Schmidt less. I'd change it again. 116 couldn't give a Schmidt less. It won't change a thing 84 or 15%. It won't change a thing and it won't get you to ring. And I spell Super Bowl 23. So let's see, positive 31.5%. And a negative way or don't give a crap that the rest. Out of 545 votes. Wow. Heavy, heavy, heavy. Doodie, you could smell it. You know line one's good and that's going to be a delta. Because that thing just cuts off. That's right. WQAM. Hey Neil. Told you. Yeah, the Danny, the Danny thing. Yeah. Only ring, the only finger he's got the need is the middle finger. His money starts screwing up and the dolphin from those in the fans. He's going to hate him like everything else. Yeah, they're going to turn on him like they do here. Yeah. Went to Pomp and OD Saturday night. Yeah. It's a card game. Hard room there. Much of the jittering gamble. There. What the fuck are you? All right, man. I'm out. This guy didn't sound nearly enough to old enough to be in that poker room. Well, that was old cockers in there, but nevertheless, maybe he's in training. 560, 560, Brad Kramer is gone by the way. The only problem is he's in Northfield. Like the cash you took it on Brad last night on the summer cast. Did I cash any tickets at Pomp and OD Park? No, I don't know. Maybe not really. Pretty kind of pretty tough. Pretty tough to catch is it Brucey this race. Is it Walley? Is it Kevin? Is it Joe? Is it Kevin? Is it Brucey? Brucey and Walley? Danny and Jimmy? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know who's turned it is this. I mean, WQAM. Hello. Yeah, I do this. Pretty good. Oh, I have a well, but I don't use this when I go in here. I use the internet explorer. Right? I get WQAM perfect. You bet. It sounds a lot better on the internet than it does not crackly on a M.A. radio. So, hey, I want to tell you. I was, I'm sorry. I was one of the airports facing the Netherlands. And when I was there, like 12 years ago, a Skipple airport had tons of security. I mean, guys with machine guns and stuff. Not anymore. I'm not a thing there in 12 years. I'm just wondering what's happened to the place. It's a beautiful airport. You could probably have your own machine gun and walk right through there now. They've been even looking at you. Oh, really? I was in the airport and they like it scored at me. I'll be playing to my designated driver from the base. Yeah. Now, I mean, I'm just, when you tell me all this stuff, I'm like, wow, this is a mild surprise. Pretty big turnaround, man. A little disappointing. Well, I'm going to get on there. I'm going to get on there. I'm going to get on there. I'll go through the right. I want to tell you, I'm having a wonderful time. I'm doing an air from my manager and listen to you. I'm cracking up. Thank you so much. You're making my day. I'm a breath of pressure. Thanks a lot, Palay. I'll still be in Donkivell. Put scenes. What do you laugh at about this? 5, 6 words in a Dutch? What a horrible language. I mean, you know. It's just, it's so sad. If they would put me in charge of Amsterdam, but that would be a great place. Yeah. No, I'm serious. I get all that scum off the streets. That would be the first thing I would do. I get all that. Ross the trash off the streets. Okay. You've never seen nothing like it. So anywhere you'd say holy crap. Even a druggy like you would just be offended by it. I've been to Liberty City. No. Overtown. No. No. The growth. In fact, the red light and parts of the red light district in Amsterdam make overtime look like Las Vegas. Wow. Look like the French Riviera. I've never been there. But I'm just one. You've got an idea. Well, you said French right. I said five six seven. Oh, five sixty. Let's get these Danny Boy comments in their way. And he's listening right now. He's monitoring your conversations. And he's got Chris Moran on their to censor on. I'll never forget during that Brian Murray stuff going on. Remember those days? Oh, yeah. And there was Chris Moran on a Brian Murray show eight o'clock in the morning sitting there. Screening the calls censoring out the calls from the Panther fans. That was one of the lowest points in the history of QAM. I'm pathetic. WQAM, hello. Yeah. Like to talk to the old speaking. Hey, Neil. I was wondering what your cake was on the Danny and Dave. David Danny. David. I already took what this morning. I had a big I took one. It was great. Well, no. I had to get it out of my system. I think it was part of the part of the catharsic. Effective my encounter with Mo. This morning and a parking lot of our reunion. I want to get all the bad vibes. Evil spirits. All the evil spirits out of my body and my rectum. And I think I succeeded. There was somebody sitting very surceptively and quietly next to me in the big handicap the zone. Yeah, you don't shout out. No, on this wall. Because they were motionless. In other words, when I usually hear somebody rustling a newspaper or like maybe cut in a little tea. That's what it's really good to take. I think the flats of your hand and bang real hard on the wall there on the sign. No, actually, when I got done, I did get up and intentionally hit my elbow against the side of the bug. I got no response. I saw black shoes. In fact, I could probably identify who was crap in the next to me there by the shoes. But right possibly, but anybody friendly. I was going to say friend or foe. Now, in the past, I would have just said friend or mo. But no, seriously, you don't believe me. You don't believe me. I give him credit. And I said it to him right to his face. Because I'm one of those people all say right to your face anything. And I'll say, I thought you're going to beat the crap on him. I didn't do it. But I said, I said, I give you credit for initiating the conversation. And I'd mean that. Yeah, you're a manch. I wouldn't have done it. Well, I mean, I tried to do it before, but that was a Greg Reethon. Hey, Greg, you're an idiot man. Everybody voted on that and they agreed. My life and local career sports video, five, sixty-two and two a-hat. Which is Don Schueler. And I sound like Bob Hope on that, say. And I want to tell you, it's the 12th one hour whatever it is. The final thing I'd like your own man of 96. Now through the standpoint that can go. If you could dollar the dollar of a tattoo, go. If you say, I'm a party guy, murdered boy. Oh, when you take him to the back, it's just a graduate. What the heck, God? Hang on, oh, right. Hang on, that man gets hit, God. Take your low, low, G-lipses. I've got a whole thing down that I can tune a page. Thinking of a big role of his friend. He told me about the spell, if you tell where it's at. Hey, you're an angel. Hey, you're an angel. That's how you get him to go. Girls just are handling bad guys. She know how to make the ball bed dry. That that chick's a shower now. Who would need this gift, my daughter? Oh, no, no, no. Hey, you're an angel. Hey, you're an angel. You're an angel. Come on, three and five, 60. Do you have any of you who have heard the final total on our first poll this morning? And you can continue talking about it. We'd like to hear your take. Hey, we've had great calls today. I mean, none of them were talking about the real thing, but that's okay. 582 votes. What's your take on the Dan Marino hiring by the Dolphins organization? It's a PR stunt to pacify Dolphins, 184, 31.6%. And of course, anybody knows, including Wayne, that there were many, especially season ticket orders, becoming really disenchanted after back to back side by each year as a missing of playoffs. And after knowing that Dave wants that is totally incompetent. He must have naked pictures of Wayne with the Billy Goat. Then he's a winner. I like it. 161. Are you trying to say it's cold in here? No, it here. Oh, it's a little chilly in here too, and I didn't, I didn't the dick with that. Oh, it happened. Oh, the thermostat either. Well, then he's a winner. I like it. 161. I couldn't give a Schmidt less. 121. Almost 21% of this crowd said, who cares? It won't change a thing. 93. 16% and I smell Super Bowl. 23. Wasn't that Troy Stratford's number? Yes, can we? On the Dolphins. 23. I believe so. Hey, Troy, time to suit it up again. Baby, I think Danny will assign him up. Sign up and suit him up. Huh? You know, they have the seniors golf league, though. I mean, he kind of like counterbalances the Ricky Williams hairdo with his adieu. Huh? Right. So it's time to do do do do do baby. 582 do votes on the pool. Pretty. 582 votes in an hour and a half. Incredible. That should be the headline and the hero tomorrow. And by the way, speaking of the headline and newspapers, what do you think is on the front page of the hero today? I don't know. Danny. Ha ha ha. Look at that. I'm back home again. There's Danny. Look at the front of the sports section. There's Danny and there's the Rick Skoor Teno and there's Wayne. And what do you think's on the front of the Sun Sentinel? I don't know. Danny. He's back. And a Johnny either. Look at that. There's Danny with the Zarmus Folder and the very serious luck. See, he's not messing around. He's got the serious look on his post. I don't think he's going to win. I don't think he's going to win. Larger not there on the headline. Oh, he's like. You would have thought WWE 3 just broke out. Are you going to thought that we're all going to get $10 million in cash as you give from Wayne or something like that? But no. Big headline just to make sure I know I'm back in South Florida. Okay, the new pull is up. What's your take on the Neil and Mo reunion that occurred this morning in the parking lot? 15 votes. Who's Mo 5? I don't give a Schmidt 4. I'm shocked, but this made 3. Greg Reachon had done this a long time ago too. I'm shocked, but please won. It's great for QA. I'm not. It's just the preliminaries. Now. Guess who ought to hook up and have a long chat with our close friends. Go ahead. Howard Dean. You want to know why? Okay. Why? Because he says he's tired of being the pin cushion. Well, if anybody we know is a human pin cushion, it's that bitch in sales. Is that what they call her? Human pin cushion? That's one of the things. Yeah. Anyway. Howard Dean from under an apacchanide democratic presidential candidates has last added his opponents. The binding Iowa voters head of next Monday's. Can you believe it's next Monday already? Good. The Iowa. You're not scared at over with already. Uh, then he opposed the war in Iraq a year ago and labeled himself the owner candidate wanting to stand up to President Bush. Remember who stood up to George Bush first. He said it wasn't anybody from the city of Washington DC. He said referring to federal candidates, John Edward John Kerry and Dick Gibhart. At a stop Monday and not President Iowa, Dean Press is attacking and was going on the offensive against his democratic rivals. He said, I'm tired of being the pin cushion here. He's there to get in stock. See, this is what I was talking about yesterday. It goes to show you how bad his advisors are. Regarding pointed comments during a debate tonight before by the Reverend Al Sharpton, who criticized Dean for not having had an American, African American or Latino and his cabinet's Vermont governor, Dean said he wasn't prepared for it. That's not good. No, but maybe it's honest. But maybe honest, but but a week it shows week organization week preparation. If he's going to be the candidate in debating against Bush, you can't say, well, this wasn't ready for that question. In a black and brown debate, that was almost entirely not entirely, but mostly a dedicated to questions concerning minorities and Regretion all of these things. How could you not be prepared for that? How could you not know that somebody, especially when a candidates are allowed to ask each other questions and are mostly pointing at him because he's the firm runner and are going after his ass. How could you not be prepared for that? You'd have to have like a bunch of morons advising you, which is why I think he's slipping a little bit. Take it right, that advice. Anyway, he says he's rejuvenated ready to fight saying that when people attack and every due in it's being a big hurry. He said, I sure hope so for your sake. Howard, rejuvenated. Now, Paul O'Neill, Shesh. Is that that? Trader, liar, what's the guy? The former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill under fire for criticizing President Bush's leadership denied today his taken secret documents from the Treasury. On Monday, only hours after when he acquittesized the President on CBS television, the Treasury Department said it's inspecting general was investigating how a document marked secret was shown during the interview. Speaking on the today's show on NBC, the Treasury Secretary said today that the documents were given to him by the Treasury's chief legal officer after he requested them to help former Wall Street Journal reporter Ron Suskine, right at book on Reel's time at a cabinet, which is out today, by the way, what's the name of that book? Why can't I remember the name of that book? I don't know. I'll find it. And all these articles, they did just talk about that book. Anyway, Ron Suskine, I can't imagine you've got too many new books coming out. I said to him the general counsel I'd like to have the documents that are OK for me to have, about three weeks later, the general counsel chief legal officer sent me a couple of CDs, which I frankly never opened. He resumed above above above. I don't honestly think there's anything that has classified in those 19,000 sheets that are kneeling only that the cover sheet showed on TV board the word secret. Not classified, but it just says secret on the cover. It looks sexy. We didn't even see what anybody said. Right. So this the fact you could take any sheet of paper with a big rubber stand and put secret on it. Well, we're going to investigate that. And again, try to turn in tables because you brought the President out of the closet and the best part of it is the media doesn't care. Because they got bigger face to fry. That is to printed material either, you know. Like audio recordings can be stamped. Secret like this show. Right. Secret show. Oh, it's secret. Don't let it out. Now where's all the response and Danny and David here? Come on, I mean, this is your dolphin station price of loyalty. Who's that? Who? Eric? What's wrong with your, what's wrong with the microphone that it won't go on when I press on? Do I have to? Thanks, Eric. The price of loyalty is the book I run such got it's out today. I go out and get out grab. I'm going to go out and give me one and a book two. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line WQAM. Yeah, that's the thing to get speaking. Neil. Yes. Just want to follow up with you. There was something that you brought up last week and I was just, I want to make sure that you were able to take care of it. Um, thread very neatly. Right, we got, we got that. Oh, you did. About 400 times, but that's okay. Thank you. Fred, very played rerun. Really? That's all I've got. What's happening? What's happening? And don't get that choke infused with the other shoulder was going to be aah. Without one, not exactly the same. The post was a relative, but not same. 53 quick votes here on this pool on our second pool. Let's hop on this. Okay, we'll get to the Jimmy and Danny and Dave and the douchebag stuff. Let's bring back Jimmy Johnson. Choice trafer. David, what do you think? Uh, who else? Mercury Morris, my favorite. Mercury Morris, he can bring us the good stuff. Huh? He can get that team. He can handle the truck lines before the game. Let's bring back Larry Zonka. Oh. Jim Kick. Paul Warfield. Paul Warfield's one of the people who are interviewed for the GM job. They probably all wanted some serious money in and wins as well. We decided that we had the best guy inside. It's just like with the Panther organization lying to you about, Oh, well, we're interviewing Larry Robinson and they never had any intention to go out and get in the real coach. Because of it, it cost them money. So Rick, who put the dud in Dudley, he'll be the coach to the end of the season. You can bet Denise Pat fans life on it. That Rick, who put the dud in Dudley will be the coach to the end of the season. Come hell or hi water. And then I mentioned yesterday I think I did. I got about 7,000 free tickets for the Montreal game for work. That's what it is. Oh. By the way, where's our friend? The other one. What does that mean? I mean, is that better call? Yeah. I mean, it's not like a great emergency. But he better show his answer. Oh, I'm going to tell everybody who is dead. He is off the air course. Once you're taken on a kneel and more reunion, it was a major event here in the QM Parking office morning. I noticed Greg wasn't around to see anybody else in the building. Saw to you, even the power 96 people were talking about. Are you ready for that? Are you ready for that? Sure. That is shocking. There's no medicine. Kid Curry probably went practice. He's got a big mouth. Almost as big as Anna squeeze. As. In fact, the two of them had well. 61 votes. I don't give a Schmidt 20. I'm shocked and this made. Shocked but this made 16. They're just made. Who's Mo 11? Great reach to the dentist a long time ago. 7. That was my vote. This could have been taken care of a lot. And I volunteered to do it. Mo agreed to do it. But no. Not Greg. He's got too many. He's too important for that stuff. You know, he can't change his schedule. He can't accommodate this. You don't have a choice, Mr. I mean, are you running and saying the son of a guy damn radio station, Greg? Anyway, 22 don't give a Schmidt. Shocked but this made 18. Who's Mo 13? Greg read the 9. Shocked and pleased eight. And it's great for QM 2. Thurs. Huh? Thursday. Thursday. That other thing. He's probably taking care of one of our friends. Nursing him back to health. 12 13 at 5.60 WQM.

It's gonna be so bad and you know something You didn't have to be that way either If Greg weren't such a such a an emotional cripple, I think that's the the kindest whack in a scrub our general manager He's an emotional cripple. He cannot deal with things head on. He can't look you in the face have a man demand earth the earth Conversation he can have a man to woman conversation. Ha ha that's an other story 149 votes What's your take on the deal moe reunin? I don't give it to me 48. Well, to you. How do you like that? I care Makes everybody's like a little bit a lot more pleasant In fact, I think it's gonna make a lot not just me and moe. It's gonna make it to the beginning. You see what I'm saying Right to brave new world right that's correct. It's just like when they took that wall down in Berlin Other Berlin wall I'm not talking about these rarelys.

Let's take a card Cona from one of our three important�� batter all run We know. Hi, of course. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. David. Alright, I'm right. It's right. Wow, I'm exhausted. Give me a towel. 14 to 1 at 560W came to Mad Dog. I'll be along at 2. And of course, we know he's got his head way up, Danny's. How does he know? He's in there. And then we got the Humphrey at 4 and then a bunch of other stuff. 5, 6, 7. Let's get those Danny calls on here. Let's get a whole bunch in before 2 o'clock. What do you say? Huh? WCWM. Yeah, hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, Neil. I just wanted to touch base when you want this. So, you know, being hired. Yes. I just eat is really a PR move. And the Dr. Fans that say that they can smell the Super Bowl. That's only because next year I think Miami hosts the Super Bowl. Really? I think so. I'm pretty sure of it. But now I want to ask you something. I'm really outraged that you don't have to Democrats have some real ammunition that on a point that they are person by both Paul and he. I was speaking out against them. Last year you had Christy Todd Whitman leaving her cabin position. Right. His speaker, what's his name? I forget the guy's name. His former speaker. Very flash. Yeah, Harry Fliesha, he'll leave. I mean, next year, but we'll sometimes this year, when surprised me, if Colin Bowlj I'm sure if I mean, then cut so much ammunition. And nobody's speaking out other than, you know, because soon it's just right. And occasionally Howard Dean will speak up. But that's it. The rest of them are just, you know, really they're like, you know, like, how to be like the slaughter that's just following this guy, they keep. You know, I'm hoping that that's Monday Howard Dean loses an Iowa because then maybe he'll wake up and they'll say, you know, you guys who advisors, you're really selling me out. You give me bad advice. I'm going to go back and be in the Howard Dean that I wasn't in the beginning. I'm going to really kick some ass. And I'm not going to be like so cautious. And you know, and the, afraid to step on eggshells, he's got to cut that crap out. That's how I got him there. You know, he, we stopped from the heart from his mind. Right. That's what he was doing his best. And now, and you say he's just following whatever pollsters, perhaps or, or who knows, but it's just not, he's not coming across the way he should. Yeah. Look at that thing. I've Richard Pearl on the around CNN again. They're more all the propaganda all the time. I think today he's going to advocate that we invade. Looked and seen next week. I think we're going to be in there. You know, the other day I was watching Canadian bacon and I don't have to ever seen the movie, but it, it, it, this is what this administration's about. They just have to come up with a new enemy every week. And, you know, let's just concentrate on making them the bad people and the rest of the, a lot of people have come up with. Let's concentrate on the important things, man. Like Danny and Dave. Yeah, there you go. See you. Have a good day. You two. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Speak now or hang onto it and squeeze it forever, man. Let's hear it. Let's hear your take. That's what this radio station is here for. We want your take. WQAM. Yes, man. See now, Carl and Hollywood. All right. I got to answer your polls. I have to say you are really don't give us this about dance safe. And I have to confess those going to say don't give us this about you and Mo. But I don't know who Mo is. Good. Excellent. But you're right ahead of the game. I'm way ahead of the game. I had one thing just to see you because I'm always interested in the polls that you do when you, when you, when you both people, and say if the election works tomorrow, who would you vote for? Yeah. And I thought maybe the next time you do that sometime later this year, I was at the Democrats to throw up. That you do a blind poll and you ask people, who they would vote for if the election works tomorrow? You're a TV wonder or a wait-churls. Well, yeah. That an ask and Mr. actually registered voters. Oh, but they'll lie. Do you think so? Oh, yeah. I know so. That's the big thing. Some of the people have put on our poll five years old, you know, or, mentality anyway. Well, I haven't done this. Have a lot of Democrats listeners, but I'm just wondering if they're all registered a vote. Why see what you're saying? Oh, yeah. No, that's a good point. I see the poll you're talking about. Okay. We'll do it. Thanks. Thanks a lot. First, like I've said many a time. It's one thing to encourage people to register and they think, well, there's some people out there, especially when you hear some of the people we have calling in. And they, uh, stay home is right. So the next day we can do a poll where I'll only ask women. Although this year, I don't think we're going to be so choose you. Okay. In other words, if you vote the way we like, well, you know, to make up for last time. Oh, no. Horses order. William T. Young does it. If I have no idea who that is. Do you know who that is? No. I don't care. I don't care about that. I mean, this guy always practices big good stuff from the Cleveland plain dealer in a plain brown, uh, wrapper. But why do we care about that? Well, here's one in the pink and one in the stink in a plain brown wrapper. Nice going, screw in. Speak of the human pink ocean. A woman who drove a car bearing the airbrush image of a stripper to pick up her daughter with school could face up to three years in prison in Indianapolis. Erica Meredith 25 Indianapolis was scheduled appear today for initial hearing on a felony charge of disseminating man, uh, matter harmful to miners. She was also charged with driving with a suspended license, a Mr. Meiner. The felony charge carries the penalty of six months to three years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Mary and Cady prosecutors filed the charges yesterday. I would concede it is probably a first amendment issue, but not all first amendment cases mean that you can't restrict a page. Prosecutor called Britsy said protecting third and fourth graders from a centerfold on wheels is one of those valid restrictions. What's wrong with a centerfold on wheels? And that's where I probably titties on there. America's really worried about titties, man. Look at John Ascrop. He was covering up titties. An officer noticed the three-by-foot image on the car's trunk Thursday afternoon after police stopped Meredith for driving with a broken tail light. She said she drove the 76-view with the pick up her eight-year-old daughter with school above a block from her home. Meredith who was released without bond shortly after a rest told the Indianapolis star, the car's registered in her name but belongs to her boyfriend. Well, how do you like that? Just as well per veal boys and girls because it is America, the land of the used to be free. You'll be dismayed to know that when they played the National Anthem in Pompano Park last night at 20 to 7, that's where a bunch of old farts sitting right now by the window who did not stand up. Oh, they must have been Canadians. They must have been either French Canadians or just a bunch of deaf old farts. And it would have been up to me if I weren't so lazy. I'd have gone right racing right on down there and said, Get up, you disrespectful nasty old farts, you old ass. I would have. I'd have gone right down there and bitch them out. Freaking $2 showbedders. Sitting there eating the two for 25-hour dinner special and probably sharing it with 18 of their closest friends from cemetery village. Shame on them. I guarantee they were their last money for the free spaghetti dinner. Oh, make no mistake a booted. 560505060 pound-56-de-de-able of bloodstream man. He makes me sick to my stomach. He could easily be the Joseph Gurbels of a today's TV. You know? The information minister. More in register, which called and I'm quoting now a cut above the rest. What were you need you say? Oh cut. The endorsement of Iowa's first lady. She's Christy Gillsack and she's joining us now live from the... She's endorsing John Kerry. Everybody's endorsing somebody. Like I said yesterday, Iowa knew Hampshire what the hell does it mean? You know? Let's take the first primary in Okachobee. Right. In Kassimi. In Pahoki. Let's stick them all in the Pahoki and Pahoki. And have some of that good cherry pie. Don't ever go to Okachobee. Do never go to Pahoki. Do never go to Pahoki with Wayne. What a funny bastard you are Wayne. You such a... such a money-grabbing piece of crap. How anybody could have a name min... And you know, we got people on the station now live. I'll suck them up to what, you know. But the fact that it matters how anybody could have any respect for you. Got to look right in a mirror. I mean right in a whatever. I'll have as much respect as he pays me to have. Yeah. Shfunk. Well, man, what it was that mean. Like all the people that claim that they respect and they got something. Yeah, that's right. They got his name on a check. How's that new pull coming? What's your take on the Neil and more reunion, which we had this morning in a parking lot? If you tune in late, you missed one of the great stories in the history of radio. History of this place. History of this community. Will it make the newspapers? No. No. To be on a front page. 249 votes. I don't give a Schmidt 80. I'm shocked, but this made 54. Who's mole 51? Greg Rejardon is a long time ago, 27. I'm shocked, but please 19. Not too good. It's bad for QM12. It's great for QM6. Coach, I'll the fact that they all think they know something. Oh yeah. They all know what's going on. WDQAM. Hello. Damn. Yes, sir. Follow yourself, bitch. WDQAM. Hello. Dave. What's up, my friend Neil? Yes, sir. Hey, Danny, but make sure he knows what kind of coffee that Wayne likes because I know he's going to be doing. Do you think so? He's going to be fetching coffee for the man. Spencer, your and boy. I'm telling you, three creams, two sugars, and a shimmy in the shake on the side. And a hokey, pokey, and a weekend. Later. All right. 560. 560. We're getting the real calls here. I'm like the sports nerd shows where they get all those deep analization because people really think this is something important, you know? Like earth shaking. Can't you feel the earth move under your meat? Something's moving. Yeah. I already had that. About 9.45. I forgot to do mine and I'm suffering for it. Uh oh. We ever find out who that was doing the quick step there. Next up. Dush shoes. Yeah. Blime. I'll say I don't talk to the police. Probably a sales hole. Executive. Don't talk to the QAM. I, in fact, I thought I might have been, it might have been tough because I heard the sound of a new medic drill. I thought it was trying to drill a glory hole through a star ran out of there. WDQAM. Hello. They kneel. Yes, sir. I toilet is going to be endorsing a percentage because he flushes three times and I carry only pleasure twice. All right. All right. The first of all. I was talking super bull. I know that was the bull I were talking about. No, no, no. We're talking tidy bull. That's a door for him. This is all because he won't ever sniff that except unless they pay admission. But. But, but it is this. This is a PR move by the dolphin's a hundred percent. I mean, how how sad is it that when they said they're looking for a GM. They said, well, after we decide who we like, we're going to go consult Dave and see what he thinks the C of E things we should hire. And that's like me. That's like my company hiring my boss and that before they hiring, talking to me and say, hey, you like that guy. Yeah, I should hire him. Yeah. What kind of action is that? Not pulling anybody way, not anybody with a brain. Yeah. And Neil, going back to the Republican versus Democrats for this election, I saw polls and today that said 85% of Republicans are going to, they're going to, they're going to vote for Bush. And it's just sad to see how those people are still lock stock and they go together and the Democrats just fall apart. Amen. And it's just very disappointing. I'll see you tomorrow in the canal, man. I'll be there. Bye. Thanks. Prop 50, 6 at 5, 60, WCM. We got our fabulous world flaming one to two hour. No more that Wednesday stuff. By the way, we're doing four full hours on Wednesday.

Now, which one of these is the first one is the one I'm not going to play to the Alice in the first? Well, no, that wouldn't be good. You're doing like a low bashing bit. I mean, we're still going to play low bashing bits. But I mean, let's give it a day. Okay. Because I told him. I said, you know, keep in mind it's a radio show.

Danny's a winner, I like it, 161. I couldn't give a Schmidt less, 121. It won't change a thing, 93, and I smell Super Bowl, can you smell it? 23. Say, there's Smell and Super Bowl, now that Danny's in the big Orifice up there in a PPPark. 560, 560, pound 560 on a AT&T, and Verizon Wireless Line, Joe Costello was just in here, getting all the information on the meeting of the two families. Yeah, looks so good Joe, looks like Mary Lange. Looks like you're getting them all the good stuff, they need. WQAM Hello. WQAM Hello. Yes, sir. Neil, I want to call him back before it last. OK, great. WQAM Hello. Yes, sir. What's your point for Neil? Speaking. Neil, you were talking about Condolus the Ricer earlier. Did you talk, I didn't hear your show yesterday, did you talk about the new book by Paul Neil of the television? I don't know, Paul Neil didn't write the book. Right, right, right, right. I did. I played the whole 60 minutes piece on the areas that he would let's see, sir. Fantastic. You should play it. Have you played until the election so that he just can hear it, go. Paul Neil was fired from his job as George Bush's Treasury Secretary. How's that? That's pretty damn good. OK, I want to give the book today and you better get it too. All right, he's called the price of loyalty. At the very steep price, we're all paying right now. You better believe it. Ron Susskahn is the author. He's a pill. It's a prize winner. Absolutely, go get it. All right, sir. How many people are you thinking of this audience? It's going to really read that book. Mike says, my name is Mike. I'm a political science major at FIU. As for the comment you made earlier about today's you turning from the crappy US news networks, you are absolutely correct. It's absolutely correct. On behalf of me and the other 76 years in my American political research course, you sue in your webpage or the ultimate political authority when it comes to our weekly class. Me tell you like that. Mike at FIU says they're holding their meat and they're enjoying every minute of it. And each other's do. My daughter also infected her high school and after school activities with the website. Great. Excellent. Now we're talking. All right. That's what we want. Living and breathing people to see it. Okay. Not those people who got one leg in the grave. Like me and my new friend Mo. We're just trying to, you know, E. God, a living. You know, we carried investors living on a pension. Five six seven. Five six seven. Five six. I wish I was on the inside. I mean, you know, we had to meeting of the two families. Just not the right families. Like the Coral, the only family would have been good. The Rockefeller's. Right. The Kennedy family would have been good. The build-up burgers. The bush family would have been good. Talking about the books. Oh, sure. That's how we got to do. Oh, yes, sir. Yeah, it's a win. Why does this keep so young? Excellent point. Why can't he get some hair? Good point. You think that a goddess got that kind of money could get some hair and go to the dentist. I'm Wayne. It's real cheap. They had that special gum. You can chew that cleans your teeth. Right. Whiteening gum. And they even had like special toothpaste now that like Whiteens your teeth. Man, somebody by Wayne a two-but-two-paste. And you know what you can do with the Wayne? Yeah. At least, I have a nice clean fresh vacuum. Oh. WQAM, hello. Hey, I want to talk to Neil. Speaking. Hey, Neil. I know about it. I hate it going north of sunrise to Brower. And secondly, I didn't appreciate Mo Howard referring to you as The Cancer at 10. You while I said to him, when I came in this morning, that's what started our conversation. I said, uh, cancer might be contagious, you better watch it. And then, of course, he started exchanging the unposed trees. And then we had our discussion and we ironed it all out. Oh, okay. Because I missed the beginning. We're the best of all these now, man. I'm on your side by the camera. All right. Thank you. Thank you. We reached in a combination. How's that? We have an understanding. And that's good. See, a lot of you think that everything is about what's on the radio and everything is show business. Well, that's fine to a point, but come to another point. In fact, he made an excellent point. I mean, I agree with him. Because I didn't mean that. Well, I don't know if he wants me to say it or not. About the diabetes thing. I don't think that's a big deal, is it? Everybody in here is diabetic. Right. So, and he knows what that's all about. And so, do I look at all the perks on the edge of my fingertips? No, seriously, I want you diabetic. The worst thing is stress. I mean, certainly eating all the crap is bad for you, but even worse than that. And even if you don't have diabetes, stress kills. Right. Ages you. Make no mistake about that. Stress kills. Wow. Sure. Hold it. Right. The second kid is here just to follow out in chunks. Mm-hmm. Comes her bleeding. So, you know, I mean, to avoid it's great, everybody's entertained by this and some people think it was stick. And people, well, what it was never was. But we need to have like a civilized environment in this place. And unfortunately, the upper and middle level management in this radio station have never been able to create that ever. I mean, you know, once upon a time, it was fairly civilized, but never really truly. It was always the running one on the hall on the people spying and who's the mole, all this other crap, all the paranoia. And of course, one thing I've discovered in my years, my 800 years on earth, is that people who don't know what they're doing. They're always the ones who are sending out their spies because they're insecure because they know what they're part of that. And those, they haven't got any idea what they're doing. I would tell you right now, I'd look you in the eye and tell you that Greg Man is the luckiest right man in the face of the earth. Next to Bill Gates. Wayne Eisenhower. Yeah. Again. Now they have only one. They did. They don't have. Don't pull me down. We got it. Now we're all hoping and saying, we got it. We won't attack us, don't hold me. We got it. We're the most likely person. You should learn a lesson is what they got you to do. Can't get any money that I won't find a good idea. You believe me, but what they say is like they're going to fall for you. extraordinary all right 560 WQ a man dog coming up next. Humphrey 4. I were a win to win. Okay 4 to 5 hour. How big of a person? Oh, I thought you were that was a command. Humphrey 4. And then Humphrey bit 5. The big, who's not got a kiss no last night. He's going to rip everybody an ass in Espanyol.

Any K-10 and Joe Markov and I 2 to 5 in the morning. Here's a facts from Tim and primitive pines who got some suggestions for some good polls. Thank you Tim or one. He says NBC 6 is having a wish female can make their lips the fattest war and only give poor a Joe blockhead 19 seconds to the sports of the night. Thanks Tim. Good suggestion on the poll. I'll keep it in my pile. My poll pile. I got a pile of polls. 412 votes on an ELN demo reunion here. WQ a man hello. Hello. Yes sir. Were you fudge fack? Yeah. WQ a man hello. One left WQ a man. Ola. I want to be a drug. 5 6 7 0 5 60 I guess that's it for the day. Yeah. They've caused our show today. That's it. Screamless not a call on the board. 5 6 7 0 5 60. We'll see if he give it number slow enough. I've got two minutes. I figured that out. 5 60 on the 18 good. We're here. Turn off the ice. I sure. I want to see him.

Yeah. I got a knockout don't come down. WQ a man hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. On behalf of all just fans and new England Patriots fans, everywhere we're so happy that they want to back again. Exactly. Well said. We love it. And as far as Danny goes, good luck my friend. But I see you back in the studio in about another year or two. You won't be able to take it. Okay. See, it would be a lot of pressure a lot of uh, nationality. But at least now they got another scapegoat. See? Sure. Now they can be in the fog. That is probably why I want to. When for it all the funny part about wants that the unceremonious way, which I heard some people mention this this morning. The unceremonious way in which Marina departed was a little out of hospitality there. In other words there's no love loss between wants that and Danny boy. I say. So that's a little on the peculiar side if you ask me. But nevertheless, maybe they'll be all of the more reason that Danny came and say, well I guess what they've I hate you like poison your fired just before the season starts next year. Make a lot of dolphin fans happy. But this guy said it very well the a paper fans in a word delighted they have wants that come back again for another uh, mediocre. I mean, another great season next year for Miami. For 113 votes, what's your take on the meal and more reunion to happen in a queue and park it off this morning totally spontaneous after a explosive initial uh, meeting. In which we exchanged a few unpleasantries. We finally sat down had a long half hour chat. We ended our fences, mended our ways and it was a beautiful thing almost. I mean, not, you know, for the 13 votes, what's your take? I don't give a $145. I'm shocked but this made 89 they're pissed. Who's Mo 80? Greg Richard done this a long time ago, 43. Had his chance. I'm shocked but please $29. It's bad for QM 19. It's great for QM 8. The great 8. Here's somebody who's great for QM. The mad dog coming up next. Bye bye. Bye bye. I'm Michael show. I'm Michael show.
