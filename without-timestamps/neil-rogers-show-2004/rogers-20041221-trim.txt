Oh, what's that? Cool, baby. Let's turn this mother out. The magic wrapper is on my TV. No one heard of him before all the name is pop daddy. I said that's pop the magic wrapper. Or won't be here that long. Not unless it learns the sing-off right up, and so I said pop the magic wrapper. He's all over and TV. Only because of one shut no porous, be I cheap at that guy. He's the one to tell him making it this way as wrong. Taking that short dead best friends, he came plus fall. Still don't get on the dog. 10, 19 and 5, 60, WQA, I'm happy Tuesday too. But it's worked out pretty good in it. They're best of tape when a little bit long about 19 minutes long, which is just fine with us. We're on the same line. And the good news is you got George's next to Bayes tomorrow. Thursday and even better news is the beefboard. Vision for George's job on Friday from 10 to two. All the pot was off. There you go. So it's the holidays and God only knows. We're kind of crappled foot on here to just fill in the time. Oh, speaking of that, we have a guest appearances. You know from two to four. Do it. Do it. By our close personal body, the mole man who's going to be I'm sure gloting over last night's shocking surprising Super Bowl like victory by that often. It was really like their Super Bowl. What are I telling you, Josh? Last week, what did I say? I don't want to say yesterday 42 to 6, which it should have been if they deployed 60 minutes. What did I say last week? The dog, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, They cannot close it up. I mean, they usually do, but they have a hell of a time closing games out. They look the other team back in the game. Yeah. Now when you were at 28 17 by 11 points with less informants left in Again, you're supposed to win that game. Yeah. But they're defense just, well, we're done. We're through and they just, and you see that so many times in games in the NFL. I've never been able to understand that a team that can't move to ball the whole game all of a sudden. Last four or five minutes every time they get the ball on offense. They're like marching out and feel like the defenses are taking a vacation. See, as the, I don't get that. Your boy Tommy Brady kind of screwed it up to. Well, let me say this to you. Okay, who would you rather have a starting quarterback for the dolphins? Tom Brady or AJ touchy, Philly or Jew, who would you rather have? That's an easy one. Oh, okay. There you go. What would you rather be at this stage of the season 12 and two or three and 11? Are you getting a little defensive? I'm not, you know, I'm not a least defensive. Okay, against the team is one of Super Bowl two and last three times. When's the last time the dolphins were even close to Super Bowl? And don't tell me that 60 two to seven games against Jacksonville? No. Well, good to wow. See, I think it was the orange jerseys last night. I think the Patriots in the last couple of minutes were blinded by the light. Yeah, the dolphins deserved it when again. They played a better game when it counted the most right there at the Ascend and, you know, the Patriots get blitzing and blitzing and they weren't getting too AJ touchy. The, a couple of times, but generally speaking, they weren't doing it. And they blew it. So there you go. It was 29, 20. It's pretty exciting anyway. I saw Danny Boy bailing out of there before the game was over. As the Patriots were on their way to what appeared to be the cementing touchdown there. And he's a kiss in everybody in the press box. He's on a way out and that was the other day of Danny Boy. Anyway, who's our poor? We got the trends coming at 1130, which is going to be very exciting. Or look at those lines line up. Hey, we love the dolphins. They are the champs. That's right. They're front running ponies, man. They're out there. WQAM dolphin Super Bowl line. Hello. Yeah, Neil. I hope you decided to retire with QA. I heard yesterday you were recigning. I thought you'd get hated it over there. Yeah. I like the money. You said that's the only reason? You meant the biggest reason. Yeah. Well, why not? What's the problem? Why do you want to pick up that things? I like you. Why do you see in Miami? Because I like just being in Miami. Plus, I have like radio is like, Who knows if it's going to fly or not? I don't know. Well, if you think you show it to the success if you went to the way mark? If this show was on nationwide, it would be the biggest show in America. That's not ego talk because I have no ego. That's what I believe. I believe that for a long time. But you know, it's just not happening. Seriously, it's had their chance and they're dittling around and they didn't do anything. And they've said, I'm also head like, you know, a little touchy feeling in this school. Like this is a show. You're not sure you said no commas in. Yeah. That's definitely it's a beautiful place. The studios are very nice. Well, what do you mean the studios are very nice? What does that mean? What are studios? They're only the operation in New York. It's very fresh class. Yeah. I know they worked with. I thought they'd be perfect for you. Well, let me let them do it again. They came to us and you know, made some inquiries and nothing ever materialized. So to hell with them, you know. They're watching. They hear you. They hear you. They hear you. They say that they're not really a servant. But they ain't going to happen. It's not happening. They're not serious. You know, I'm saying they're name maybe serious. But they're not serious. We're on concern. So screw them. But no, do you do need a new agent then? Okay. Good luck, dude. Well, okay. I must have been a lot of Howard's boyfriend's. It's something. I'm going to be your agent. Well, I was there seriously. I mean, you know, Stern allegedly from when I was told. And I haven't had no reason to just believe it because it was somebody who's up to tie signs with him. I had them contact me and all we want to know, Rogers on serious. And I was, you know, some contacts were made back and forth with Norma and with them. And I was the end of that and the same with XM. I don't, I don't have time to do a dittler now with people. I like the certainty in addition to which I'm a dottering old clown. Okay. I'm an old fool. And one thing I'm not foolish enough is to like, you know, give me the money. That's all. Just hand me the money and whatever else. And in addition to which I'm not putting up with anymore of the crap that's going on last year or two. I just want to tolerate it. Clorence. And this is like games that they're playing like with this thing with the Beast Nibiting last week and then putting them on again. I mean, I don't have any problem doing Friday. It's that gives you the day. Often it's a day before Rutgers is saying, it's crazy. But we're just, you know, there's not this show does need any messing and a fixing any didlanders leave it to hell alone. Okay. Where about, whatever, whatever other day parts where you have problems like you're going to have mornings when Stern builds up worry about fixing that, not this show. And that's the one thing that they've been incapable of doing. They just won't stop dittling and mess it and change in the time. And that's the thing that infuriates people, including me and the audience. So, Clorence, you can sit in there and play all little games you want. You can do your little UM circle crowd, whatever you're doing in there. And it doesn't, doesn't impact me. You don't exist. You don't even exist. That little you have had in that university mommy, Phantom World and Enclables there. That's that's what he's all about. Him and the Beast. It's always been that way ever since he was in there. In fact, maybe that's where the problem lies. You know what I'm saying? You try to look at the situation. Well, there's a, we got a few problems in here. Where are they really lie? Where's the centerpiece of the problem at QAM? Maybe that's where lies. Right in that orifice. You know, I mean, maybe in somebody's back down orifice. But anyway, just ignore him. Okay. Whatever he says to you just to, Huh? Oh, I got that bad hearing from him. Tell me your pop and oxies like Rush, you can't hear anything. What? Exactly. Here's the poll from yesterday. Which best describes your feelings about Christmas. 1444 votes. Pain in the ass. 473. Right. 473. Pain in the ass. Too expensive. 247. I'll say the thing for you to about serious issues. It should have been syndicated a long time ago. I don't know anybody also. Do you know that even Lynn Saniel's on serious from one to three in the afternoon every day? And let me know. We love you, Lynn. But let's face it. I mean, get serious. Oh, she did. See? Even she's on the every day between one and three. And we're on this station with a fuzzy signal. Let's got this Spanish music in the background. I said it's sexual. Maybe not always exactly on time. But within the day or two, you know, it's good enough. It's called self preservation instead of ego. Those people are want to like keep bail beating themselves on the chest and hey, look at me. I'm a big sound. I'm going to revolutionize it. Go ahead. Go ahead revolutionize the world. Change everything. Okay. Not interested. I just want those checks coming in. Anyway, Christmas to expensive 247. My favorite holiday, 2209 isn't that pleasant? Certainly for Guy, I'm 194. Fun. 194. Christmas is fun. It can't be unless you get too serious about it. I would think unless you get stuck with impine needle. And it's very important the birth of our Savior. 177.4% of this generally heathen audience. Say, it's very important holiday because it's the birth of our Savior. Our Lord and say. Oh, don't don't don't. Our Lord and say, Jesus. Praise Jesus. Jesus Christ. All in the carliles on the baby curtain today, but I better take the break before we are spawning on that. Now, we're going to start with our Rogers morning. Let's go. And we're going to run to find the ship. We are. David's a bit fewer here. You took Flintstone's vitamins to make sure you grow up big and strong. What's today? Big and strong isn't good enough anymore. That's why you need to give your kids Flintstone's chewable steroids. The non-bidiment would be extra fun. Ask yourself, what do my kids need most? Healthy balanced nutrition or a lethal muscle mass that makes them feel like they can crush anything in their hair. Flintstone's chewable steroids come in poor tasting flavors like Fred Winston Dioland, Van Drolland and Oxen Deenor's Reem. With Flintstone's chewable steroids, your kids will love their new Balkan-sriated muscle tissue, and it will be years before they even care about their ever-shrinking genitalia and what little girl wouldn't want to be the first to end her rounding spoof to have her own go-tene. Rock, raff, momma, raff, raff, raff, raff, raff, raff, raff, raff, raff, raff! Nate's your kid up, Flintstone's chewable steroids kid. 10 million strongs and bulging. 1032 to a five-sixty. That was really interesting first call, you know? Yeah, it was. It sounded like a set-up call, like an inside called a main like an insider, yeah. Right. I mean, well, like a really beautiful studio's near. First of all, I'm not going to live in New York, and you don't have to live in New York to be on serious for any of those other, to be on anywhere anymore. Right. There's not a chance in hell that I would live in New York, anywhere that I would live in Miami, most of the year anymore. And I know chance. But that was obviously an inside call, and stuff, the agent that's the problem, it's the people with the companies. I mean, if you are serious, if you're going to live up to your name, then do something, get off your ass. You know, make some of that offer. They've been contact that for a how many times. And I'm at me, but I'm out well fine. You got your super star. They're good luckier. Maybe it's going to fly. Maybe it's going to be really big. I just don't know. And my feeling about that whole business is I consider in belly achary day, but oh, we can't play the far-tiles. It's the callers that do that, generally. Oh, you hear that far-tile sound in that promo, which I even heard until yesterday. I don't need that. Okay. We don't need that. I mean, the fact that we keep getting restrict all this, I'm unhappy about that. And we know every now and then make a big issue on it. But to every single day, well, gee, I can't do the show the way I want here. If that's all you got, man, they're just ain't that much there. Okay? I'm sorry. That's all you got. It's far-tiles and words. Then to me, that's not a big deal. Who can't do that? Who couldn't go on the air if you if you if you put just about anybody who's fairly articulate on the air and you said, okay, you can say anything you want and play make any sounds you want and talk about anything else you want and the most grotesque show stuff you and you think that person wouldn't get a big number. Hey. You know what I'm saying? Oh, I'm sorry. That doesn't require anything special. No, no. Oh, you know, crap. Oh, man, he said, crap. Everybody in the world wants to say something say crap. Well, we've already heard crap on here. You know, it's just it's old. Who needs to go? There you go. How about again? Okay. Twice no less. Here, that joys. Yeah. So anyway, for the guy from serious to just called, I haven't signed anything yet. Although I will be there in a day or two and I you know, plan on signing. I mean, the deal is supposedly written in clay. And we'd like to play. I don't know. And this business about how I hated it. I don't hate it at all. That's especially being away from there. The fact that it matters is that it's not even in there which stop hyperventilating and the getting, and it's taking great joy in trying to ruin everybody's life all the time. Just like leave it alone. That's all. Currents and others just leave it alone. And stick that little maddie bell in the broom closet where he belongs up the other end of the building in power 96. Get him out of our face. That's all. And leave us alone. Just wind it up and let it go. It's one of those day parts on the anthoos just wind it up, let it go. And it's just the money comes rolling in. That's all. Most programmers in the business, they be ecstatic. They'd be peeing in their pants that would show like that. That brings it millions of dollars. And basically is like stress free. Just leave it go. But they he too like poison. That's the problem. And they like the beast. Oh, give me a break. Will you please? That's the first time he's ever sat in that chair. An issue and said anything was last week when he was auditioning for your job. That's the first time ever. Yeah. And we'll see what happens Friday. Not that I'll be listening or that you'll be listening. But that ought to be very entertaining for hours of the beast. As he tries again. WQAM Hello. Yeah. You want to have anal sex arts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 560, pound 560 under Verizon and singular wireless lines. That was, see that's exactly what I was just talking about. Talk about one dimensional. WQAM Hello. Yeah. No. I kind of agree with that call about. I mean, two major really can't go there because they're going to have the satellite radio, Canada, probably next year and I mean, the camera. I think your age is not doing that good over job. Yeah. Well, let me ask you this question. Okay. Do you listen to this show on this station every day or whenever you can all the time? So what's the problem? So there's no problem. You're going to hear that. Let me ask you another question. Do you enjoy the show? Yeah. Yeah. I can show better and how it's started. So what's the problem, I mean? I don't know. I don't know. You know, if you got a local high school kid who was the ball hunter in five miles an hour, okay. You get to see him and enjoy it. Right. I don't know. I mean, I think you were in the same pose. How it's started. Yeah. And so I would like to see you to have that opportunity at the rest of the people in the country. My lawyer can't get it done. Okay. He's too busy with the marijuana laws and with certain local wacky people. He just, he's just got too many fish to fry. Can't get it done. Yeah. I for one, I'm going to call up without that a mic called matters. Or I'm going to call up. I'm going to call up. I'm up in New York. I'm going to call him up and just say. What are we going to look at this easy chain going here this morning? Where did this all come from? No, just, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, because I, I, I want to, I really think that the radio station like you, I am. I really, I've said this before. I talked to the other one of the other guys. I think they might be on their way out. The good ones after how it's turned goes. They would put everything in the house, turn after he goes. These other guys are going to start going. Yeah, they might lose the dolphin. And I'm going to ride them to you. You can be like that movie where the guy was taking a grave in the war. You don't want to go straight down to me. You're going to be here. I'm glad you're here. Careful. Okay, well, I have a great day. Good luck to me. Okay. Well, I didn't realize I was in such bad shape. Ha ha ha ha. This is great. I listen. If you choke up there all we can do is listen to you. I'm just gagging on them. Right. They must have like a, some kind of a Daisy King going here to serious people. You know, you don't have to call. You don't have to talk to. Okay. I still don't have any ink on a paper yet. You know, you could call, but they didn't do it. He's been emailing them and letting them know well where you're getting close to making another deal. And we knew what a naughty, oddy, oddy and this and that. They're just, you know, they're like in a state of suspended animation or whatever. Who knows what their deal is? I don't see other than Stern. I don't see any great town thing I lined up for there with Mel Carmeson and all the Southern crap. Oh, they built this studio is now lay. They did this. Well, that's great. So having a nice studio. The audience doesn't see this studio. And no one reminds me of an IOD. When our engineer was so concerned about the clock on the wall and the fact that it was going to Like mess up the brand new beautiful studio. And I kept trying to tell these people the audience doesn't see this studio. You could be doing a show from a from a toilet. Like in other, as long as the show is good and it's entertaining. The audience only knows what comes over that speaker in their radio. They don't see where you're broadcasting from. It's just like wherever the homestead right now. What differences that make? So the fact that got beautiful studios. That's wonderful. That's wonderful. Letting 40 cents a buy about a third of a cup of coffee. Okay, wolfies. If they open up again. But hey, let's get a whole bunch more calls like that. And that's very entertaining. 5, 6, 7, 5, 60, 5, 60 under Verizon and singular wireless lines. I thought they all become like Rubin. Oh, how about that? It's an offense. Really kicked your team. We have right. We let them off the hook. And like I said, if you can't close the can't close it out. You let the other guys hang around. Every now and then it bites up and hits you in the ass. And what the hell was Brady doing? What was he doing at Bulmer? What are you doing at our time? Maybe, you know, al-micro said it would come in for once. He said it's the ball. The ball. He threw the ball. He had a device, it's even Tom Brady's not perfect. Now he looks kind of perfect to me. Although I've never seen all of it. But nevertheless, he looks pretty perfect to me. But he's not perfect. Guys make mistakes, guys make dumb plays, even the best of him. Look at George. Right. W.Q.M. Hello. Yes. Yes, sir. Yeah, I want to talk about this serious thing in Howard and everything. You know, go ahead. Oh, still? It sounds like me. It sounds like me. We have guest on Buckwell. Phil has him. Howard has him. Can't win it that norma. What do you think? Everybody that loves you down here wants you to get even bigger. And you're here with that with that piece of crap agent. Yeah, you're right. I see the loser man. Yeah, get Buckwell. Then he does a stupid baseball games and baseball cards and we want you to be bigger. Yeah, I'm a bigger. I'll tell you that. I eat a little more. Yeah, not even that kind of bigger. Oh, for you get rid of that guy. You know, he's holding you back. He's he is the impediment of my assistant. You're right. Thanks, pal. I have a great holiday. Whatever you're celebrating. He's right. He's holding me back. You're an impediment to my life. And now he's like, oh, well, you know, I know you're going to give me a summary. He's already getting some cash off of them. You know, for this new deal, it supposedly we're doing. And then he's like trying to stuff it off of me too. Makes up this crap about how every time we sign a deal. I get, you know, we'll see about that. Patting himself on the back for the phenomenal job. He did that. It took about 75 meetings to even get these people to sit that suits you place. And agreed to a deal. Now you're these people are right. But I'm dealing with a guy who's just living in the little leagues. You know, his thing is fantasy baseball. It's a fantasy agent. I had, I was in such a good mood this morning. I'm getting a record. But I'm a nice long eight or nine day holiday. And these people are like, oh, I don't think I'm doing so bad quite frankly. I'm looking at my portfolio. I'm stationed in a way like it's going out of style, man. Things are doing pretty well for my life. I feel great. I do the show here. I do it there. Where would I feel like it? You know, life is pretty good. That'll teach you to take calls. Yeah, no, I'm loving this. I made it. We'll do this all day. I'm just to how we're willing to carlil the hell with the pool. I just sit here and take all these calls. Tell me how poorly I'm doing now. We all want you to be big. Yeah, well, I ain't going to happen. Okay. What are you going to be successful? Yeah, exactly. What are you going to start making some bucks and what is the kind of like, I don't see anything in the newspaper. We're just having chicken and a hero that's done. I'm not saying anything in there. Neal Rogers resigns for with few way in for two more years. I don't say anything about that. When you think that somebody would have said something, I'm not it's a big news. It's not like steering going to serious, which is a revolutionary change for the whole business. But I mean, it's something of local interest you would think, right? Are you saying anything in there? No, I didn't see anything. Of course I don't look. No, these people are too busy playing little games. We got too many game players. They're like clearance. They're like the beast. And all these other little silly children. Children. Not adults. Not professional broadcasters. silly little children who want to play games with the careers of people have been doing this for a long time. So, to manage in this market. And these people are trying to get me all whipped up in New Friends. You have about nothing because nothing is going to happen. Sirious isn't foot me on. Exams isn't put me on. Nor can't isn't give the show a syndicated. I'm here on QA and I'm not unhappy with that. I don't have a problem with that at the age of 110. But these people are informing me, I'll hear me single call that I got problems, man. I got serious problems. Mold tape over Limey. What have you heard? I have a research say. What? I said you better take a look. I better go look in the mirror. It's not a pretty picture. I'll say that. That much I know. QA and hello. Mayo. Good morning. Yes sir. When is this? Yeah. I forget about theories in the satellite. What I want to know is how this man, the stage, and your designate you syndicated. Because I hear all the time of who can replace our that. Doesn't the station make money if you're syndicated? Or is that separate deal for it? I mean, it was here. It still have the show on. Of course, they would still make the same amount of money. You bet. I mean, I think that what everybody is trying to say. I mean, you're making the big work. But it's not really a problem. But it's like, if you know you. Well, what is it? It's not about that. What is it about? Ego. I don't have any ego. I'm one of the few people in this business in show business in any form where you shave. I don't have any ego. I don't. That's stuff that rolls off my back. I don't care about that. Yeah. I'm looking at this market for 30 years. How could you have any ego left? Absolutely. I mean, like you're being like this lady, you can control what you say and everything. And I hear everybody saying how is it? Who's going to replace our turn? I bet that if you were for some reason, we put in the Howard Stern station that he's on right now. Nobody would miss Howard Stern. I don't know if you're going to say this. Yeah, I wouldn't do it no matter for any amount of money. This station offered me a lot more money to do moreings when he gets finished to do six to ten. I'm not getting up at 430 in the morning ever again in my life. There's no money on me in the world. It's worth screwing up my whole life for that. Absolutely. Well, they're lucky. Thanks a lot, Pally. All right, little okay. Everybody's pound. I don't know where did this come from. I don't know, just write it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So Tom Brady said five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty, five, sixty, on a Verizon and singular. This is special today. We got those trends come out, 1130. We're going to kick some serious ass. Howard Stern, Neil Rodgers, Jim Manage, Hank Goldberg. We're going to kick big juicy ass. And I don't even know what's going on with the other people on this station. Where did this all come from? This has got to be a setup. But this has got to be. I mean, this is just like the thing with the beast last week that they were trying to like audition him to take your job. This is another setup deal. Maybe they're trying to talk me to not signing this deal. Maybe that's what it's all about. WQAM, hello. Yeah, I got a setup for Neil. Speaking. Neil. Yeah. Oh, great. Neil, I've got six friends of mine. Two living friends, longer than one living. Yeah. And they want to listen to you over there. That's brilliant. So you've got to go on serious. Well, what is serious? Seriously, isn't going to be on in France and London. They can listen online right now on our website. Anywhere in the world. Yes, not going to be overseas. Start online, radio. And not any time in the next 10 years, I guarantee you that. And I'll be pushing up these easy before that happens. So very. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, god. OK. Well, how can I? OK, I'm going to take it. All right. No, no, forget. Get serious, OK. Yeah, so that's the model for the 2005. Now, get serious. That's why he's to write all those stupid picture cards all of the time. Get serious. That is to write, get serious. That's a little variety. I'm just to be a little too cute. See, it's zero. And here we are, we're getting serious, not. I mean, that's what this sounds like to me. It sounds like it's inserted effort. Like, oh, can we, like, a last ditch last minute effort to like talk me out of that whole deal? I don't think that's going to happen. You don't have hard to find. No. My agent's rate hard to find. He's sitting home, shoveling food in his fat pussy. I guarantee you that. He's got his beeper number and his cell phone number and his home number and his orifice number and his, you know, one of the hotline number, whatever he's got going there, his mirror, one of the abnormal abnormal lines. He's got it all going. Oh, look at this. Hey, that's that. There you go. WQAM, serious line. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I wonder that the week has come out, just watch the ball drop. That was good. I'm not sure if you can watch the ball drop. I'm not sure if you can watch the ball drop. Hey, five-sake, at least I was a little change of pace a little relief from this other madness that's going on here. That's just keep on. I'm going to get a serious face on that first call. That was so obvious. That was like that. Thanks. We got that day about how the beast is such a birthday party. Remember that Josh? Yeah. And that's Tony Facts. And what did I say? As soon as I read it. I said, oh, this is an inside job. This is a setup. Yeah. And I come to find out that whole deal last week Miguel shows up to do Georgia's deal last week and sit on the show because that's why I asked for. And all of a sudden, on the same day that Miguel drives all the way in, oh, here's the beast just half of the show up. Well, I'm doing it. The clearance told me to come here. Yeah. Well, tell parents to blow it out as stupid as. Okay. We're sick and tired of clearance. Take them to the shrink. See if they can shrink it. WQAM, hello. QAM. Welcome to the parade line. Hello. Yeah, I want to talk to you. Speaking. Neil. Yep. Well, I want to give you a fire report. Okay. Listening to a boy down the aisle, dialed there, man. Big dogs. And he's got air three on him. He's family on about how the organization, softened organization, got an attitude with him. And air three goes, Joe, you got to remember their listening. Excellent. I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm listening. And don't forget speaking. I'm listening. I'll be on for a little bit of a day or two of the class. So you can do one of them. I'll have to. I'll have to turn the dial off real quick. Okay. Good luck to you, pal. Thanks. I love you. And don't forget. I'm listening. Five, six, seven, five, six. You had a mow as on today for one of his very guest appearances. He might as well do something. He's getting paid for sitting out. I guarantee he's going to be just all carrying on. Well, that's another reason. If I didn't know that he was going to be on today. I'd have really been rooting extra hard for the Patriots to see a lot. Baby up last night. What a shame. But you know, it's one game, man. It's still 12 and two. It's like life goes on. Not the end of the world. Not looking good for the playoff picture. It's not going to help any. But nevertheless, it's only a ball game. See, over here, there's that big storm that's coming up there. I'm getting off. He's the here is going to be Chicago and say. Woo! That's why I got to get there a lot of here, man. By Thursday, it's going to be like the end of the world. Hear that big storm is coming. Not looking good for Thursday. So George, we got to Marlons Thursday for those of you who like him a lot. And those of you who hate lump like poison. That's too bad. And then Friday, we got to be stunned. We got to be stunned. I don't know who's going to be doing two to four because Beast originally was going to be doing that. Do we care? No, we don't care. Maybe he'll be doing six hours. Maybe he could be doing the same time. Maybe he'll be the Beast all beast Friday. W to Q and hello. Hey Neil, how you doing? Pretty good, Tally. Very good. I just wanted to throw my support behind George. I love him. I hate the Beast. He's a fast blob and goat dealer. All right. Oh, he was still good to get to that last part. I got news for him. Mr. and he, I'm sure he knows this is a stealer strand. There are less couple of games. They've just wiggled off the hook too. They played pretty crappy. They just like the Eagles have played couple of pretty crappy games in Raw. And so, you know, even the best of teams, it's not easy. Just ask those 72 dolphins about going undefeated, right? They're still winning though. Who's that? The Steelers, yeah. The Eagles. Yeah, but you got to admit that. Did you see the Eagle Game in, of course, now that they got the Terrell Owens? Yeah, he's out. I'm sorry, Terrell. I see I can't figure it out. He's out. He's got like, I've got to have an operation on his ankle. He's got his anatorium. He's got problems. He's a finito for this season. And so they got the serious problem. They can be had. The Eagles. But the Seaters right now are the best team in league. Anybody would argue with that. I would tell you, you're full of crap. How do you like that? Being the sportsman, even though I am. The Eagle, the Steelers are the best team in league. And you're who we called back in the day when they just pounded the crap out of the your Patriots? Yeah. I remember that game. I do. Which happens to the last night with the Patriots on the last of the season. No, well, content me, man. I mean, they just pounded the crap out of us. Let's see. We're going to do the new pool. I guess I better do that. Brenda Carliles, the media currently today. She was born August 1758 in Hollywood, California. Uh, ranked number 76 on VH1's greatest women of rock and roll. Oh, man. Several films, frequency 13 going on 30. Not 30, man. Two hundred cigarettes, circulates, Roman and Michelle's high school reunion. Manicom. I remember mannequin. You remember that? Right. Kim control. Wasn't Andrew McCarthy and I movie? I think he was. Don't like Andrew McCarthy. No, but when he started hanging out with Robloin put on that Fony dog and pony act. Fast times at Ridgemont High, she's having a baby swing. She's got a long long. She's been in about 80 million movies, okay? And TV stuff and pop stars in there. The business are going to brown her. What? The go-go is at her singing career. And audience with the BG, she's been in all come. Brenda Carliles. There she is. I'll look at all that great on there. What? But I said Brenda, Brenda, Brenda, Brenda, Brenda, Brenda. Brenda, Brenda, Brenda, Brenda. She used to get pissed off about it. And when her she is, Brenda Carliles, excuse me. Here's our pool today. And this is not that original. Everybody's doing it, but it's that time of the year. It's the first official day of winter. The last two days with the coldest two days and 62 years in Toronto. My luck couldn't get out of here a little. I had the time would have been nice now. Coldest two days and 62 years. And I mean, I don't mean cold. I mean beyond. And then I'm reading in a Harold this morning. Oh, a 35 degrees, the poor homeless author. How about minus 35 Celsius, you idiots in the homeless. Here we got homeless like crazy here. And they're out there. Their heads are like freezing to the sidewalk. So they're tongue believable. It's criminal what goes on with a homeless in this town. Hey, here's the pool for a day. And then we got the trends coming loving 30. I think we got this thing. Look, they will have a whole bunch of people called. Oh, gee, you're agent flows. Yeah, where what is that? That couldn't have been an accidental. You know, that guy called right off the bat. And then all of a sudden we had to be slowly, call in in. You, you, when you have thought that somebody would have said, Oh, hey, it's really great that you're going to be around for another four years now. You know, you just have to. Right. Hey, I don't have to buy one of those little deals now. Right. I don't have to spend any extra money. Listen to the radio and the entertainment is free and granted. We got that Spanish music in the background and your management or a bunch of bulls. Oh, it's, but nevertheless, be nice to know that you're going to be on for another four years of you stay alive. Wouldn't that have been great? Not one. Not one hat. See, and that's our floor. That's one of the reasons I don't want to be there. Maybe more than I absolutely have to be. Too many miserable people that want you to be just as unhappy as they are. I'm happy, man. I'm not the least bit unhappy. I'm a happy camper. Life is fine. Life is sweet. As Defa would say, back when he was killed in them Indians. What was the most important story of 2004 to you? Got a whole list here, including two that I mentioned these two. I don't know. Better change. Better switch the poll on here on my thing. Because I got the power, man. Here you go. You're just switched. Bush wins reelection. Scott Peterson trial. 1,300 plus dead US soldiers numeric. Oh, and by the way, speaking of that multiple casualties reported US base in Mosul, at least 22 or dead 51 wounded Americans and Iraqi soldiers. Another grotesque to a bone of bomba Grande again and it just goes on and on and Bush is saying, Oh, we're all right. Anyway, 13 under plus dead US soldiers in Iraq, Red Sox win the world series, the hockey lockout. That'll be a lot of votes. Oh, yeah. Dolphin season of disaster. And that's even after last night. It let's face a tree in love of his aide disaster. Howard Stern signs with serious radio. The arrived to a senior in QAM. And then I also got the, when you get these at the two. Read about it. Jan Jackson, voop flap. We got it now. And for hurricanes in Florida. I mean, I'm sure there must be some others including in fact, AP has got their own thing the top stories of the past year. Like Reagan dies. You want to put some of these others on or not. Some of you guys, I don't care. Let them call it if it's important to them. Well, no, I'm saying we got now. I've got the list here of the top 10 from AP from the AP and then we got the ones from Wartman's in the next hour and law velocity and no now. What's Albert's name? Not game erages, not I mean, that's, that's silly. Error fact dies. No, that's the, the, uh, I think you're wrong about the marriage thing. I think that's because we're going to be in the middle of the, but what's the question, Gamerage, what? The game erages. Well, what's our question? The most important. Okay, Gamerage. I guess that's the story. Yeah, there is. Gamerage. Reagan dies. You can put that on there. And then they've got Russian school seizure and Madrid bombies. Neither what you're going to get any votes to mean, and forget about those. And I don't mean forget about them. But they're not, they're no more content in our crowd. When you greet, yes. I knew you were. I'm reading a facts. Huh? I said I'm reading the facts. I'm about to say it. Oh. Okay, 1056, if you have our topic today is how Niels A. In sucks in Eul is a feeling really bad and, uh, shame that after all these years, I show us so great. These, uh, got so many important things to say. And if you would have been on nationwide in the last election, Bush wouldn't have a chance to steal it. And I think you're right about that. But, uh, all those other people that promised they were going to get carry elected. And they're too busy worrying about the same old craft. And that's what bugs me. That's the only thing that would be nice is to be able to make a little impact. To have like a million people every day looking at our fine website. That's so many people so much work into like Josh. Oh, I know. And right. Right. Seriously, it would be a little bit nice. But we just don't, I just don't have the, uh, the, uh, power to people behind me. I got, uh, you know, Stern has got Mel Carma's in the head. Now again, it's serious and buckwheat, and all these people. And I got the normal, you know, who's this silly person who means well. I mean, means very well, bless her soul. But she just, uh, over her head. She's grounding in the sea of a little weakness, you know, keep in mind that her radio experience was on the light bulb. And that Saturday morning showed that she wants me to keep plugging out in some station. Nobody even knows where it is on the down or what the conglages are. That's, uh, that's where she, that's her concept of the business. You know, pop that janko. Yeah, look what I got. Very good. I've actually the beast wouldn't come up with that. 10, 50 seven. It's, oh, you just wait till the last show that I do man. You just wait. I don't know when that's going to be, but you just wait. That's going to be one for the, uh, what, it's so an institute for our kids. I'll wait. The holiday season is here. Any truck knows that and the people at Armstrong for the homestay. One of the thank all their loyal customers for the business and trust. Everybody with a brain knows that Ford makes great vehicles. So to be competitive Armstrong for realizes they need to offer more value because you can buy Fords and a whole lots of places. So Armstrong was the first for dealer off of your tires and batteries for life. Plus a Florida sun pass with each vehicle you buy by president general, Mangler David Richen again also wanted to remind you that Armstrong for always has highly competitive prices. Man, you can't beat their deals. You can drive away in a brand new 2005 F 150 right now. Armstrong for just 13, 938 or brand to less tradition for only 24 190. Great prices had to value in friendly service. That's the Armstrong difference. When you're ready for a new vehicle, come to the deal that treats you just like family. Armstrong for the homestead Southwest 307 street US one exit a Campbell drive off the turnpike. Price and include all factory rebates and discuss with the pro credit plus tax tag and fees. Happy holidays from the great folks at Armstrong for to homesick. This is the Neil Roger show. This is the brain. And now here's Timmy Dean, founder of Timmy Dean forksauce with a few words about new Timmy Dean's vagal salmon. Hello, I'm Timmy Dean. You know, as someone to tell me it's 25 years ago that I've been making vagals, I'd have said, huh? That's two food, isn't it? But times have changed and I guess I've got to change with them. But I don't have to like it. You people want your bagels out give you your bagels. What a big old Greece is slab of Timmy Dean forksauce Johnny. New Timmy Dean, non-coachier vagal sandwiches. If you're Jewish, you can buy him. You just can't eat a new Timmy Dean vagal sandwiches. There's a little bit of big it everybody. It's 11 or two. At 5.60 WQM happy holidays to him. That's too generic for any of the people out there whether Jews are glam or my, whatever you are at too bad. Happy holidays can cover it all. It's a nice, it's a pleasant thing to say, you know? Right. And it's considered because just like some of the Christmas cards, if you've seen some of the stuff that these crazy banter Timmy, Oh, they're doing in Jesus name. We wish you a blessed holiday. And you know, they know that I don't believe any of this. Craft it's like a slapping a faith. It's like what we do it. It's like what Pilar is doing to everybody inside on past and it's like, It's like giving everybody a big slapping a faith. If it ain't Pilar doing it, it's Gwen is not in three-cylinder of the bushes there. Trader trashed a recent. That's a great show to bed that nobody watches it. At least in this crowd. You know who watches passions besides women? I call it students. Very big. Now college students don't listen to the show. But that's me son. Yeah, that's you, of course. Yeah, yes. Yeah, we got what are you going to do? Now this facts that you said made the trends will be in it. Love them 30 by the way. That's two thirds of the fall rating book for those who keep track we've been doing that for years. And it kills them good time. This is from the chronic in Cocoa. When as I stop and think about it, he has got to be the most chronic facts you're about. Not a bad guy. I'm sure, but the most chronic. This writing is so, you know what I mean? Right. Yeah, he's chronic, but that's all right. Nice. Good guy. I'm just saying he's chronic although he has had a couple of cranky facts as over the years. He says, hi Neil. I'll defend it that if you're right to work when and where you want. Or retire for that matter. Retire! Retire! However, as a lawyer and a patriot who fears to the future of my country, I desperately want your unique mixture of humor and real moral values, moral values, for I'm in the purple states like Ohio, Iowa, Nevada, and New Mexico for the next four years. The purple states. I see the one good thing about this deal is it keeps me on the release of the 2008 lesson. Right? Correct. Nobody's going to be here. It makes me accept the same folks in South Florida who will all vote for the democrat anyway. And most of my audience. Please do me, you, Michael Moore, and your country of favor. Before I talk about people, see this deal with this reminds me of, Perh. People who get carried away with themselves and really take themselves to importantly. One lesson. I'm going to give all the young people who might be out of school listening. Don't ever take yourself too seriously. Don't get into this syndrome where you think you've been like, change the world. This one thing to be altruistic and to try to do some good during the course of your lifetime. But the more you're around the more you're realized that you're swimming upstream, just like for Howard Dean. Anyway, it says, make sure you're new QN contract has a provision law on other entities outside South Florida. Pick up and we broadcast your internet stream. And we got an authority to get our internet stream on there when some Jack has near friendly decides to open a pond in the building. Right? The language plus the fact that they hit our website like poison that resented because of the fact they're jealous to QN websites like it's in about two years. They were we getting one day and in terms of response. The language should allow you to decide which entities get access and what fees you're going to find if they will pay you for it. If it also guaranteed QN or percentage, say 10% for any such fee received. This approach is painless for you and QN and leaves open a possibility that the great unwarshed masses will finally get to hear you and maybe even wake up I will still have a country. Who knows? Sir us and more may buy a fondric cable channel to reach millions or a serious may slow popularity. Don't foreclose your chance to be a part of it says the product in Cocoa. Oh, what does that mean? For clothes my chance. Just like Salotso said, you know, these people ahead their chance. Right? Right? I am the hunted one. Nothing ahead their chance. I mean, you know, I don't see, I don't like to a business with people with a dilly valley. You know what I mean? I go to buy a new car. What I buy a car I do it over the phone. How do you like that? Do you believe that? Sure. What a true story. I talked to my friend Greg Nelson. I've went to a new Corvette and tell him what I want and there it is and they bring it right to the house. I signed a papers and have an I stay and if necessary, his little sick and you go by. I have a great life. He showed you a little color chart right there on the phone. Right? That's right. I don't know. One of these people at like like when you go into a store, the handling people. Oh, brother. Oh, he's talking about the Canadians. He's got the first Canadians again. You know, just Canadian regular. I got a friend here. They went to the store when I bought my TV. My Samsung 46 inch. I stole over him. Much better. And that came last night. The picture was so crystal clear man. You could have reached in there and padded Tommy on the head and said, okay, Tommy, bad play. But next week, we could be a different story. You know, whatever you want to say. Although next week, you got the tough game against the jet. So that was not a for two at his time for the Patriots to choke in the gag and blow that game last night. You know what? Well, maybe it was though. Why is that? Maybe you wake him up. You mean? Yeah. I do think they were looking past that that came last night. And spread all their comment about the Dolphins. Great defenses. So I think they were looking past because defensively and on the special teams. And they're not just a 72 year part return. But every time every time the Patriots kicked off or put in man, the Dolphins had a big return. They were just they couldn't tackle anybody. They were in their heads. And that defense I watched every game they played. And they just said they weren't into it. In the last two minutes it was like, well, you know, we just can't get the job done. I know what it was. But you know, in sports no matter what, there's a lot of so long season. Nobody's going to be great every week. Except to course certain people on QA and Brian, but all those Super Bowl rings, right? Right. Rings and things. That where we get lunch and time rings and things. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pawn. I have no idea what's going on here today. This is just out of the blue. I mean, it's very flattering. It's very nice. Oh, we want the best for you. And you want you to like a beer. Because why? Well, what difference does it make? What they're damn, they're held that unconvincing me that I'm not happy. They, they sound like a management of QA in there. Maybe it's a conspiracy. Maybe they, at least put up calls are coming from inside the building. Here's line nine. This ought to change the whole tone. QA, I'm hello. There's a buffer. There's a hole in the hole in the hole. Yeah. That's the old. Line nine always builds a sub. Just keep that in mind for future reference. When you're filling in for the beast. Right. WQA, and hello. I'm happy if you're happy, but I'm shocked. I thought I thought some daylight year that you were going to settle. And we could hear the deal rod is show on sensor. I really didn't. That would be nice. I just, I, and then you choked around a little bit. You, you're actually, you're, no, I wasn't talking around. There were some discussions going on. I thought something might happen. But now far, this can't get it done. He's just, you know, how far did it go? You can talk about happy work. I'm not going to make it. For my face to my ass, I would say, as if I've how far it went. No. It didn't as far as it went. Well, there were never any number. There are many dollars, uh, uh, discussed. No, it was never any offer made. What? What? What? Nothing. I'm going to get pardon. It's time to, like, he didn't even talk. No, he talked to them because I know the names of the people that I, uh, uh, we recounted the conversations. There were several conversations that took place. But I think the fact that I still had two years left on this deal. The fact, if this deal would have been ended like the end of this month, I think I'd be under January 1. Well, you see the F. A couple times. Yeah. Okay. Doing the break. I'll say it several times over there. Do it. Just to make it. And I come on. Oh, brother. Just when you think you got a life to get out, and then these people come along, you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know. And then you know.

And then you know. And you know. And then you know that. And then you know. And then we know. And we know. And then you know. Finally. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's a very good place to watch the show. It's like the... It's like the next show. OK.. What's it on IG? Yeah itシ farms a 2 year old computer. Again... Oh. I had mistake when you know what I haven't sent anything yet. Let's take a poll on that. Wait till you hear this. I'm not going to read the whole thing much too long. I'm not reading any long articles today. Not on this day before vacation. I'll let you do it next two days. If you're at least doing it on Friday, you're going to read a whole lot of intellectual crap. Probably about the UM. Smoking gun, present and authorized, they torture red. Abu Ghara, right FBI email says. This is disgusting or what? How can we do it in here about this before the election? Shut up, Colby. Repeat it references in an internal FBI email suggests that the president issued a special order to permit some of the more objectionable torture techniques used at Abu Ghara, and other US-ROM prison facilities around Iraq. The email was among a new batch of FBI documents revealed by civil rights advocates on Monday. Other documents describe the initiation of investigations into alleged incidents of torture and rape by detention facilities in Iraq. The email which was obtained by the ACAU represents the first-hard evidence directly connecting the Abu Ghara prison scandal and the White House. The author of the email whose name is blanked up, Abu Ghara's title is described as on-scene command or bagbed contains 10 explicit mentions of an executive order that the author said mandated US military personnel to engage in extraordinary interrogations tactics. An executive order is a presidential edict, sometimes public, sometimes secret. Instituting special laws or instructions that override or compliment existing legislation. The White House has officially needed to admit it nor denied that the president issued an executive order for obtaining to endure it in a certain way. Abu Ghara, whatever that is. It's certainly. I like that. The whole story of the on our website that's for tomorrow. Send your old bunch of stuff for tomorrow already. Just to give it to myself. Great. One of that that way I figured maybe it'll be on by Friday. What you're having issues, you know, Josh has having some issues with his internet provider. Yeah, I heard it at a pit that would call me back by the way. Yeah, gotta get that straightened up. But I'll leave that up to it the two of you because I'm not going to pay attention. Let's see, here's the fact that his uncle nails butter really kissing ass today. I would like to assure that Neil God will always be number one with me. As far as Howard sperm is concerned, I enjoy his e-show and from time to time. Listen to some of his radio show as far as you're concerned. If you can join Howard on satellite, I would absolutely pay for it without question. But at least get syndicated. At least as far as how you handle your business, I was raised in New York when my father told me to respect the handshake. Unfortunately, the modern business will respect nothing but a high-powered animal for an attorney agent. Even if you're attorney friend, Norma has naked pictures of you dump him. He blows and why wouldn't you? I know he blows. I want everyone in the world to know what we have known for years. There is nobody better. I'm sorry to say that no, this is no such job. The station here runs stands for nothing. Wow. They don't appreciate you. I know that. They certainly don't deserve you. I definitely don't want you off the year even for one day. But I think that my this is just goes on and on. My biggest reason is that if anyone on this planet doesn't have to take crap, it should be you and even the little George. Don't settle. Please take a stand for all of us working, slips and kicks him ass. If anything, sign your dear ear into you, then you do get syndicated and you'll go, wow. Wow. Wow. You're using it here in that. Now, it's like a drum roll or something big, something dramatic. Me. And here I thought everything was going just fine, you know. Well, we're fine. It's called setting your standards too low, man. Setting your sides too low. Shoot for the moon. Right? Don't sell yourself short. Well, that's already happened. But I think the immado has to be shoot for the moon. Fuck the moon. Right. And Norma can't. He's like, you know, like I said, I'll probably handle the league. I'm like, I'm like, myder leagues, literally baseball. G-softball, stuff like that. Yeah, that's especially. Think that things that he can relate to. So now I'm getting like, I think I'm getting sick. I'm going to sort of throw it all of a sudden. I don't want to do that. Got like a lump in my throw from this. Then you won't be working tomorrow. Regardless, I don't want to be sick during my vacation. That's the worst thing that could happen. Then maybe I'll take a couple of likes or weeks. And we can have the B-san filling in for George. WQAM, hello. Hey, Sally. Yes, Sally, how are you doing? Hey, that weather doesn't like such job. That was all true, though. Absolutely correct, sir. Wow. Yeah, yeah. I tried calling you a bunch of times when you're on the Godfather. Can you put the Godfather music on? Can I ask you a question about it? I can do whatever your like, man. Whatever I see, you happy. I can find it, I'm saying just a minute. Okay. There it is. Just a second. There it is. All right. It's in the Godfather part one. When Michael put the hospital and the Baker guy shows up to God. And Michael, I'm going to help me. For your father, for your father, yeah? Yeah. I'll take a take a put your father. Right. Right. He asked us to be a Lieutenant Lee. And the Enzo, the Baker guy, has tried to light a cigarette. Michael thinks his white apartment in light a cigarette. And then he gives that lighter some kind of a funny rod. And when the back to a light that was a indicative of something like a trade or ship or something, did you feel how I applied the movie or is that just, uh, I think you're listening, man. I think he's doing so many bad mushrooms. No! I don't remember anything unusual about the lighter. I remember the scene that we're standing on the steps of the hospital and the put your hand in your corporate lucky have a gun and they dropped by and stopped and they looked and all of a sudden they took off again. And then his hand is shaking as he's trying to light the a fact of the cigarette. Right. But Michael made it. And this lucky look down at the lighter. And it looked like he was reflecting on a memory of something and then gave the lighter back to us. So, let's go. I'll have to watch it again this weekend. Hi. Okay. I'm afraid of it. You too, Halley. All right. I'm leaving. I had my chance. I am. See, Godfather the original one. How we say Godfather one and a good one, Gregor Solves. So there is no Godfather one. Well, you have to differentiate because there's three different movies. Okay. The first Godfather the original. Every actor, every actor even the people with a good part is they were all spectacular. That's what differentiated one and two so much from three is that unfortunately when it became a financial issue. You know, when he stared like cut and corners one was cut back on our expense. They cut corners and it cost him a lot of money. That could have been big. Godfather three could have been sensational without Eli Ward. Without George Hamilton and certainly without Sophia, that's all he did. Oh, okay. I've been mad or could have been mad or good. And even Andy Garcia, I could live without. I'm not the big fan of his. Even before he stood in the street, they're outside Alianito's, uh, Nick believe house. Oh, great. Did on that movie's Kirby was the best. He was the best in that movie? No, no, I hope you don't. Maybe they could be. Here you go. Welcome to QA in. Hello. You know, God. Yes, sir. Speaking. I feel like Howard Veal, I've been calling for the last three segments trying to get through. Okay. Because. I don't know. Thank you sir. Go ahead. Honestly, the reason I'm calling is because I think I can sum up why everybody's saying what they're saying that they are about you in serious. Yes. It's because, you know, Howard fits in niche for the juveniles when it comes to, you know, juvenile humor and things like that. that's great, he's got a great audience. But to be honest with you, you couple with most people think on your audience with comedy and or humor and breaking up the day because we all have crappy jobs and we do our lives and we listen to you to try to get through it. And honestly, I think it would help the Democratic cause if you were syndicated, so I firmly agree you should fire an armicam. Yeah. And because we need you out there more, I think we need to go out and work time to consider you what do you think? I think in clothing and down calling on, I will leave you now because I know you're busy. OK, thanks, they got. OK. Was that a look at our Howard Beal? Maybe it was like a skinnier look at it. Here's the way the polls come in so far. We got those trends coming in just a few minutes. Who's going to be bringing those in? Duffie, I hope, certainly not clearance. Clarence isn't allowed that studio anymore. Unless he's with the beast, hand in hand. Look at that, the sun is shining boys and girls. I think it's going to get up to maybe 32 today. I didn't like that. Like I said, all these silly pansies there. Oh, it's you. It was down to 35 or 40 last night. Yeah, poor babies, man. Poor babies. Oh, look at that. It's only minus 3 of 26 right now. I'm getting carried away. But it's going to be up to like one to day, 34. Aren't you excited? Unthrough. Aren't you real happy for me? That's why I'm getting hot here. We'll find out. Anyway, what was the most important story of 2004 to you? 147 votes on there. 1300 plus dead US soldiers in Iraq 46, Bush wins reelection 36. Neorodier signs to your extent to the QM24. It's not signed yet. Four hurricanes in Florida, 23. Howard Stern signs with serious radio seven, Red Sachs win a world serious seven. Duffin season of disaster. Three in Sputtle last night, which took a little bit of a sting and a stink off, but still disaster. A three. Talkie like out one. That's probably what? Yeah. Game marriage, Reagan dies. The energy action, movie flap and Scott Peterson trial, all of got the big vote. You are listening to Neil Roger S. Clucydlade on 516. Total body. But one man trapped in a strange world must defend his honor, his woman, and also that weird cult thing he's in. No one has a best of a touch. He was the famous man who's ever lived. John Hussies, the last Scientologist. It's as legitimate as any other major religion only for some. The last Scientologist, if you call him gay, you'll sue you for $100 million. But if you call his religion crazy, he'll catch you in half. Likewise, with a four foot samurai sword. Call wasn't so much to his son. But if you're a winner, he will be in the sauce. The last Scientologist. What do you want from me? I mean, which size my fame, my fortune, the plate of soul of my life? Oh yes, my soul. Tom Hussies, the last Scientologist. Unless you count John to both it, ten a health man, and if you are, they're a gullible Hollywood area. The last Scientologist is now playing with your mind in a theater near you. Okay, it's 29 till noon at five sixty about the leave. A leave, which is also an approximation is the drug. It's how I believe is the brand name. Okay, is the latest pain relief, which I get the a cabasht now. The fellow breks, five is his OEA work and advertising. More which is a lie because I son at four at last night. I think during the football game or somewhere. We're not going to advertise anymore, but we're still on a. We still got to get our money out of it is what they're saying. They had that big investment, so they're going to kill a bunch of people. So you're going to have your viox, your fellow breks and I will leave, which are now linked to heart disease and stroke is what they say. Oh my God. Why don't you use it? Because the FDA and the government are really care about you. Not only care about it, the big pharmaceutical companies and helping them make all them either can. You know what it really makes me, I was sitting here this morning. Think about our good friends at very, you know, and about. And yeah, that's a simple thing. Back when we had a real problems in Europe, especially they were getting their ass sued over some of them drug. I figured which drug was back then. And they really need some cash flow. And all of a sudden we started getting these letters with their trash. Show them up. And everybody in their brother was pop in Cyprol and buy an up Cyprol. Remember that? I sure do. Did they ever find a guy who sent those letters with their hand trash? And it now. I don't think so. They're filled with, you know, didn't they, uh, convicted the company? They got a person of interest. No, they just ruined his life and cost him his job. But they didn't have any evidence and didn't convict anybody. I'm sure. Now a person of interest, you know how that is? Right. Okay. Now one of those transvestor companies coming in baby here. This is going to be huge. I always say that don't I. Well, they're always, each, what is the huge unit in the other one? I'm starting to have second thoughts about this deal. 567, 560, pound 560, under Verizon and Siggular Wireless Line. I think we are going to inflict as much grief on them as they have on us. Oh, God, we don't have enough, enough years to do that. Somebody QA and hello. Hey, now what's up? How are you doing, sir? Pretty good. The significance of the writers and all that crazy, as far as I got to start with the memories and all that. Just end those and just shit, we're shaking like crazy. And then Michael took the lighter from him. He realized that his hands weren't shaking. And that maybe he had a stomach for it. You know, I see. I see. He has a true. He's got it. I think he made it somewhere on it. All right. Bye about it. Thanks a lot, pal. Yes, he might go to the horse sale. He made the net this way. Your perspicacious him. And I know what to realize now. That's me. Very good. What? Got to rewatch it? Yes. Something like the least as seen. Yeah. Because the life from this, you know, military, you know, war hero and he was like a good, uh, a good, uh, a good family. Please, buddy. Boy and all of the Southern now of a sudden, when he started came home and got involved in the family business. And then he realized more and more than he was the era parent because they came after his dad had to step up. Right. You know, the step up to the plate, like they say, step up. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Oh, I hit a fast machine run. That's not numbers. Is it? No. Oh, well, though, tell me we're going to get like a stall routine today. It's supposed to be 11 30 this morning. This is September, October, November, which we had that huge October, Steering went through the roof. We went way through the roof. We went all the way to the moon as a matter of fact. What does it say? Oh, geez. It says I'm a 2070 year old South Liberty and hip hop loving punk. I grew up listening to you and my mom's car on days like this with no school. I listened to you, lead. We would more than half of your crap. Well, that's not bad. More than half of my crap. To me, you are more talented than anyone on the dial. Well, that's true. And I do listen to Howard. I agree that more people should hear you before we all die. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. People deserve to hear a voice. Like you're a speaks of do it. Harry, do know what does it say? Do know a harming. Whatever that says. Or happy do know a harming. Harbotic. I can't read it. Harmonity. Oh, great. Thanks a lot. Happy whatever your name is. I got an happy or a monocody to you too. What? You got a lot. You want the end? Nothing. Just 12 plus. What does it look like? Who gave it to you? Clarence. Clarence Dero. Right. Came into our studio. He's the program director. I don't give a crap. What is title is man. I got a title form. And what if you say he said mumbled mumbled something out of it? Oh, what is it? I don't know. I was listening to. Mumbled mumbled. He said something like the other ones are coming right out. Something like the beast is going to have your job before the end of the year. And it's already 20. So second. Yeah. 25. For two nine in the morning. We're what? And 25 to a 2 9. 13th to 14th. Great. That's a 6 to 10 a.m. Yeah. What about 10 to 3? 10 a.m. The 3 p.m. Yeah. Pureless. But in it. 35 to 35 flat. Type for 11 to type for 11. 10. Well, 12 plus. That's for me to. Yeah. That's looking. After noon. 3 to 7. Yeah. Where is it? Well, you know, you got to turn a lot of pages together. That one. Yeah. We're going to a 2 to 2. From 18 to 21. Well, 12 plus in me. We're 12 plus. The audience said there's no understandings waiting. He said, we've 12 plus means everybody can be aged 12 to 200. We want those men 25 to 54 is what we want. We want to be aged 12 to 49. Oh, you know, we're looking for many 18 to 24. But that's another story. How many of you are? Huh? 5 6 7 0 5 60. 5 50. 5 60. On a Verizon. Sing it a wireless line. Son of a, those don't really mean to 1. Looks flat. Well, that's what don't forget. We're going to lose that awful September. We're going to be dropping at the design. That was the end of the world September with all those hurricanes. I think they, I think they distributed like four diaries and all of them were like the trailer parks. What was the most important story of 2004 to you was our full question. 180 votes. Here's what we got. 1300 plus did US soldiers in Iraq 56. Bush wins a reelection 44. For hurricanes in Florida, 31. The O'Rodger stands to your extension with QM28. Red sauce went a world serious eight. Howard Cernstein assigns with serious seven dolphin season disaster only three. Uh, Reagan dies one hockey lock out. One Scott Peterson trial one. Game marriage in Janet Jackson. Ruby flat. Nobody. How do you like that? All the craft that we have to take over that like half a second of a flesh and in the meantime, there's nobody who gives a crap about that. Nobody except Michael Powell and a bunch of other crazy people on the FCC. And Joyce, that's another thing that I don't rejoice about too much. As a fact that we, we have to take an extra pound of flesh out of all of our ass because Joyce is so whatever the FCC is wherever they are in terms of restriction, she's like a thousand light years beyond them in terms of not letting us do anything. Right? There's no question. Absolutely. Oh, you can't play those cards, man. It's not a matter of time. We can tell you in a promo you home all but we can't play it on the year. Oh, I see Joyce where's the ration of it. Oh, don't mess with us. We're corporate. We're corporate. Yes, see, I think that's one thing we're forgetting. Why is anything going to change? Same thing going to change? No. I mean, the fact that Clarence is still trying to stick the beast of both of our ass. I mean, I don't, I just am not so confident that anything's going to change with these people. It is that we've used to get it. WCQA and hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, you remember the the chief sandwich with the vision of the virtue. Absolutely. Absolutely. You bet. Last night I took the most pleasant dump. Okay, Ram, happy to hear it. I've made it look like Maddie Bell. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Tom 5, 60 and a Verizon and singular wireless line. There's a guy that's got Jesus in his bowl or maybe Joe Cephas. WQA and hello. QA and. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, Neil. I've been working here for about 25 years. I think the thing is, I'm about two months ago I watched a godfather or good balance on you with day. Still a great show. I still watched it. But it loses the effect without something of a whole thing. You know what I'm saying? I think that's like your show. If you couldn't, you know, be more free to say what you want when you want to say it. Yeah. I think the show would be even better. Well, there's no question about that. And we've had to give back, you know, a huge chunk of wood and stuff we can play on here anymore. Much less say almost anything. That's true. I think that you have to say the F word, 9152,000 times. Well, you can't tell me. It's totally fancy a big idea. Exactly. Anyway, I have to. Okay, pal. I have a great time. Okay. That's enough. That's enough. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, we're waiting with Bay that breath on somebody side. These 12 plus numbers are the one. They're in sound. They're in sound too thrilling. When you tell the other word. Oh, you got them? Are they any good? I didn't look. I just took them away. The facts were cheap. We know I didn't even look and see what they were. Oh, this is a fact. Oh, I just can't make any good. Why am I texting these? They're what? Persons 18 to 34. I just pulled them back out of there. Howard had Janko. Look what you've got. You've got to go to the mattresses on this. When it's your shot, imagine the nation of what does it say? I don't know. A nation of line 9's. Fire norm. It's not personal. It's business. Thanks to AWS. I say only happy holidays because it takes the Christ out of Christmas. That's right. We don't have to get too specific. Okay. I mean, if you're talking like two religious people to each other, well, married Christmas, you know, or whatever. But when you're talking to people that you don't know what they're like, believe or not, have a little bit of respect, okay? A little bit of respect. A little bit of respect. Is that possible? Oh, crazy boy. I'm out there. I was turned show. Meal Rogers. Mortings and we did. Oh, I was around the clock. The clock. The clock. The clock. The clock. We are. Hill. God. I'm going to call the memory. And every day you gave to us. The little day is so old that I didn't use to go and gather like this, right? And every day is so old that I didn't use to gather like this, right? And every day is so old that I didn't use to gather like this, right?

And every day it is so old that I didn't use to gather like this, right? Yeah. And every day it's so old that I didn't use to gather like this, right? Gordon Lightfoot sings Christmas. Yes, Gordon Lightfoot is coming the town with a swayload of songs like this. Let's take a quick look at the songs we've been playing on the TV. It's Gordon Lightfoot sings Christmas and you'll want to feed him like a drum when you hear his rendition of the little drummer. Who can make so many better of a drum or a drum and a new boy can't deceive him. Gordon Lightfoot has compiled a holiday music collection. You'll wish with synced to the bottom of Lake Superior. Dad, the home with a drum or a new car. Your friends and family will pray for a silent night when you put on Gordon Lightfoot's Christmas. What is it pretty depressing? I'll tell you what I'd say to the writers the trailer for Angela Gotha Diaries again in November. I didn't even get that part. Have a good look at it. Oh yeah, I OD through the roof again here. Number one in midday, number one in man 18 plus, number one in the afternoon. Huge. I mean, wait, I love that. So it's September. They got two thirds. They'll open up on the whole book. They got two thirds of what this is here. Wrapped up. That is just a man. The morning is a little, I don't know, this is pointing to me. It's creeping up. It's just creeping up. Now it's moving in the right direction. But it's a little bit disappointing. Of course, if you take some temper out of the mixed areas, we'd be okay. But it's not like the phenomenon number I'm taking is supposed to be there with all the big height, the hoopla, all the history. You know what I'm saying? I don't know. I mean, we actually went up from a six to the six four, but we dropped from a second to third. Okay, two to hell is number two in the day and man. This is an 18 plus though, not 2554. CMQ FM. Oh, I see. So we had heavy your people again from a five eight up to a six eight. No speaking in glass. I key, which also always seems to go right in line with a right wing, a friend you know what I would think. Quintedance. So there you go. Let's see. Many team plus overall in station is number five. Just from 14th to 6 to 5th. That 14th thing was that September business man. What a hurricane. From a three four to a four four four to a four six. But number five and many team plus into exciting to me. Mornings. WSTJs number one in man. WSTJ have no idea what that is. Obviously, no speaking in glass. Oh, you could have a word. Hot. Another ethnic six point four is number two. Weky. A radio mum bee number three. All the ethics all the time. Wioding number four in the morning from a four six up to a four seven in the strength and then WQM three two to a four out of a four five. Number five in man. That's, I don't know. That's just, it doesn't, it doesn't know anything for me. Look here. I mean, let you live. It leaves me limp like a white noodle. Does it do anything for you? Yeah. What about the afternoon? Let's see. I'm going to go to a four seven out of a four four from a time for second in the last trend down to fourth. Of course, this keep in mind has got that September we might as well have had the transmitter shut off. And based on what I'm hearing about the signal right now, we might as well have a shut off. Let me get my down to it. These are not the kind of numbers one would expect from a highly touted morning show. You know what I'm saying? Fact quite frankly since he's been on the air here. He threw in at one big month in October. And we had a huge month there in October. And after that other than that, it's all pretty, maybe you'll hear when you agree with that. I think you'd be forced to agree with that. Yeah, that's it. Let's see. What about tonight? Well, there's no story tonight. We have nothing on it. We have no hockey games, which is probably a bonus because nobody listens to those. I would be at that three point two. That's the heat and your buddy. Okay. Anything else? Q. I'm two nine out of two six. This was not all that throwing when you came right down to what it was. Maybe you'll hear I guess. We're holding our own. And then we'll see what happens when September drops off. So our fate was hanging there in December. That's the whole thing month of December, which is already of course over with. And then we'll have that tour day in the next month. So now we sit and we wait and we wait and they calculate and palpitate and agitate. And you know, the take of a good at WSDGA. I mean, this is what happens when you deal with this heavily ethnic market. And you get this, you know, and again with the political season going on. October September October November. There was heavy in the election thing. Obviously the right wingers got the diaries because in the mid day, WID went from a five nine and up to a six six and then September October November. A seven point nine share, which you know most of that is rush. Yeah. CMQ FM up to a six point. And now what is their story? What do they play? Is that the one it's got the funny guy on or whatever? Why don't we go find a Cuban subordinate? No. Q I am four nine six two and like I said, we want to have to have two six four. Let's still drop from second to third. You turn. Yeah. But audio mom B, hot 105. Kiss. They're kissing it. What about a lot. We don't have the right to demo. So that's it. I don't want to dwell on those because they're kind of depressing. Here's the fact that says, hey, Neil, happy poor. I love the spelling on it. As an analyst or Howard and you, the reasons why we'll not get serious for the Howard to or these and why is I get order the deception and the lies he's telling his audience is too much. One, they're raising monthly subscription prices. How high at least 15 to 19 dollars a month. You're only work four days a week. He will run commercial spots like he does now just like HBO is he says. Right. What a joke in the serious technology is a generation behind XM and XM has walked man's type units now. And one more thing, the people wearing those sticky filthy yellow bracelets we get it. And all you, uh, bulls with these support our troops, stickers on your cars and listen fight if you believe in this F4 have a nice day. Very well somebody to hit a little bit when and out he's letting it out. That's pretty depressing and demoralizing to me. Looking at those numbers there. After they give us the big booster and October. Oh, look, everybody's happy now. One big month, one month didn't make like a, uh, just like a ball game last night. You know, hey, Tommy, you and your buddies there. You got to play all 60 minutes. Not like 58 minutes don't get the job then. I played about a 50, about a 56 or 57 minute game to pay for this last night. The game goes 60 minutes. Right. And the same with this. The rating periods extend three months. They're always rolling like CCR rolling rolling. Rolling. Yeah. Rolling like your arts. Right. Like you roll in a big fat one in the Harold September October November. And so once we drop off this September, I don't know. Maybe maybe they got the extra affiliations for the individual month or Men. Some of the maybe month, maybe your friend clearance there, your boyfriend. Maybe beast a bottle in with me. And never know. In fact, maybe the clearance will turn into the beast. Maybe that's what I love the more joined to the hip than the arbiter. You know what I mean? Or maybe clearance will all of a sudden puff up and look like the beast. Like somebody stuck a bicycle pump into his back home. You know, I'm talking about he's junior. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6. You know, I'm really depressed. This audience has brought me down to a level of near suicide. And now after these. I mean, enough that they're banned, we actually went out right. But how can you go up and go down at the same time? Somebody else went at more. Oh yeah, they went through the roof. So obviously out of those three months, two of them were like right wing bush people. We can only hope that some people to the left of it till a long got a few diaries and he's never otherwise rescrude. That too. WQAM. Hello. Yes sir. What's up man? How are you doing, pal? Hey, I don't think the often fans, of course. Well, congratulations, man. They played a great game last night. We had a lot of starters out to you, but whatever. I know you guys are still a tall. Also the favorites, like on the second year, that's why Troy Brown was there trying to cover on it, winning touchdown. I was kidding. That was pretty funny. That was pathetic. You turned it along way, twisted inside and out. He was lost, you know. Yeah, I know. But anyway, I know you guys still got a good shot to go on all that. But I think Pittsburgh might take a serious, but you know. I'm be honest with it, they're going to have to show me something against the Jets next week, because the way they played the last couple of weeks against the Bengals and in the game last night, they're going to have to like that defense is going to show you a lot of the way. Well, one thing I wanted to say is I know Bill, Chuck, a genius and all, but I think he's getting a little bit too fancy, schmante there with that one set up with no down defensive line. Yeah. And I think he's just a little bit too, his head's getting a little bit too big if you know what I mean. Yeah, and they've made a lot of mistakes that are indicative of not the, I mean, I know he's great, but some of the coaching, for example, when they did that three weeks in a row, they're a Corey Dylan last week went out of bounds and didn't stop for clocking in last night on the punk return. They ran out of bounds. Yeah, and he ran out of bounds. He ran out of bounds. Right. I wish I would give him a two-man, I don't think he would. A lot of high school level, he should know that, but you know, nobody's perfect. Yeah. Yeah. But you guys still got to get team whatever, and I know it's a fun game, but at least we have something to cheer for a minute. Yeah, it was a signing. It was exciting. It was exciting game. All right. I'm sure it looked great on your TV too. Beautiful man. I was pan-timey on the end of back. You go, boy, but he kind of fell apart the end. All great. They found a happy holiday. See, I'm back to you. You go and he sure did even went down. Don't throw the ball. Oh, geez. Tommy, the guy's got that bright orange jersey on. Oh, so see that? Maybe he's colorblind. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 4. I was thinking like four picks in one of these. That's not good. No, John. Oh, and now you're laughing about it, huh? Let me risk you again. Who would you rather have as you're starting quarterback at your head? You know, if you're franchise, would you rather have Tom Brady or Adriate touchy feeling with his nose pointing toward the west? Come back. You're getting defensive again. Not, not at all defensive. I'm very offensive, man, because it's so obvious. And you guys make some couple of mistakes. There has one bad game. I think I look at that one. I think he's got. I know it's funny. I meant to tell you, when I was sitting in traffic, I was listening actually to the pregame. You know, they actually have a segment that they, they, they, like, they interview Tom Brady and they say, they're like, oh, Neil Rogers favorite quarterback. Here's Tom Brady in the same way. What? Yeah. Who was saying that? It's like those voice, you know, those program voices they have. But it's like before they throw the interview on Tom Brady. It's like, oh, here's Neil Rogers favorite player. Tom Brady. Well, that's true. Well, that was kind of weird though, you know, they just threw it in there at a nowhere. It sounds a little gay to me. When you come right down to me, doesn't it? I thought this was like a macho sport. Maybe they're starting to begin to understand what a, what a sporting event is where a guy squats down and all fours and other guy puts his hands under his ass and starts squeezing the ball. Maybe they're starting to figure out what that means. I am proud of you. I am proud, you know, Russian lateness. And I like scrubbing my smeligery, the house with soap made from jewels. And listening to the new role. Okay, I'm going to use the hour. Hey guys. What the hell? He's really rocking. He's rocking chair, and out he's aggro. And most millions of them can be the rung. So why should anyone care for a patty stroke? I'm a curler. I'm a bright guy. We've got a shiny teeth with a yellow light. The garment teeth and then go buck. We said a patty for you before a patty stroke. These yellow teeth, they die from a brainy old patty stroke. These wadly eyes will immerse their blood out. We must have to pick the check-up for inner patty stroke. And the white shine just like a real one. They may be dying. But he will never leave. And all the eyes of you like a razor leaf. And then provide him. We just for new years he used to be our patty stroke. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And you know, he might just go touch his bones. And he might just go touch his bones. Probably want happy to do it too. We're going to be numbers again. Let's see. Let's see. See, we can. Is that the... there's not too exciting. Now if we had the mumpies of scrap weight, did we got them there? No, no, no. Why not? I'm sure they're working on them right now. They're working on how long could that possibly take you. How long you could do that? You could do it in your head in 30 seconds. Fuck me. I mean, you could. I would need a calculator. I could do it in 15 seconds. I would need a calculator. No, I don't need to a cat calculator. A calculator. No. Yeah, a calculator. Okay. I think we're putting some caca now. If you ask me from what I'm hearing on these bones. Oh, no. I think they got a point. In fact, the one thing that would discourage me, forget about serious, forget about I've said forget about any of these things. All this pie and the sky talk, syndication. The one thing that would discourage me from really putting a pen to paper. I'm that whole deal. Is the program director. I don't like his attitude. Yeah. You know what I mean? What do you mean? I've no problem with the operations manager. And at this point, the general manager hadn't seen him in so long. I don't remember what he looks like. But the program director, I think he as far as I'm concerned. He could be the trigger in the wood pile. He started to bug me. Because he's supposed to be on our side. Remember we had this at IOD the same thing? Who with which one? No, I'm not talking about that. But I used to say the talent needs somebody to go to bad for them. The talent needs an advocate to like be on their side. Even though the, you know, these these people would titles. Of course they have to sue the over management, which in our cases, if a full-time job. And you see what a program coming from with us. And I'm starting to feel there's like this adversarial, this highly irritating, huh? You're starting to feel it. Well, I mean, I'm not starting, but it's becoming intolerable now to the poor. We're not even like communicating with that one. Because he just refuses to get it. That people basically want to be treated like human beings. It's very simple. Very simple. Not complicated. Somebody is a good job for a fine. Pat him on head. Hey, come back tomorrow and do it again. And have a nice day. That's it. But that doesn't seem to be within the capacity, certain people who are becoming like, just like Michael and the guy thought that's a very good analogy, you know, when he was like, like, holding that cigarette lighter and he realizes he, he realized he was starting to get to be another tough guy, you know? And then when they had the McCloskey team and he had to hold them up and smash them and broke his jaw. And that kind of tough it him up some even more. So he turned out for me to really good guy like they're one, the one decent, honest, reasonable person in the family. They're like just another gangster, yeah. Another gangster. Another part of the mafia. Another person above you. No, and I'm starting to see I see the same thing going on there. Anyway, here's Brad says the XM factor is incorrect. He is absolutely incorrect, sir. Sirius product is much better. See, we're getting loaded with, see, a few people at Sirius want the new Roger Shaw. He had it to say, well, here's a proposal. Here's something, Mel. What was the other guy's name, Jay? Who? Did the guy that called? Oh, I don't know. That forgot. I don't hear anything from them. And so all of a sudden that they had a no or just starting to go, they're just starting with a show with a very first call. This guy looks like an inside the old two here. It says Sirius product is much better. They have walkman portable. Sirius has three satellites for better coverage XM has two. They've stated, Sirius, that they did not intend to increase subscriber fees. In fact, Mel has stated, is there an lower than their trackness subscribers? Mel has stated. Mel, like it's Brad's good post personal buddy, Mel has said. See what I'm saying? Yep. I think we're getting a bomb crush. You're like, we got the old squeeze on. You know, I feel like he made the squeeze here. Like I like how Puss pimple you. Talk about it. Just like that like a zip. This whole deal going on. Oh, here's these who gave you these. Oh, stop. See now we're talking about a good guy. There's one guy we can always count on. Kind of like a emotional cripple but a good guy means well. See, there's a difference between means well and means like, I don't know. The other one. I mean, if you could separate, if you could cut, it's like the sign means 20. If we get that operation there, like separate, Clarence and the beast at the hip. You know, on St. E. Trial Fine, it's on the way. That would help. Oh, see, look at that. I told you to remember was not a lot good. No. Six A and we had that big month in October. You take that out and we're like, there's no story there, man. No story. Morning. There was St. E. Trial Fine. Look at this. August, 3-1 and men. September 2-3. Now that we all got, do we just, do we just, do we know Diaries return? Because of three hurricanes. It was, it was a throw. They should have, they should have canceled that month in the Miami market. We're going to think in all of Florida. They should have. October 6, 6, 6 in the morning. Big number there for Howard. November 4, 6. And again, all right, we're going to go through Diaries again. So we get screwed. Then in midday, now look at that. Midday. Mm-hmm. You looking at that? I'm looking at it now. Let's pretty decent to me. Quite, say, 6-4 and August. 3-1 and September 1-1. Holestation got buried. Because we like to say 2 Diaries. 9-2 and October and a 7-4-0 November. That looks pretty decent to me. A 7-point. Oh, men. Which means in 25-54. We've got to be like an 8-1-9. Right. And then of course, any afternoon's like that. So great. 3-7, 6-3-0-3-7. In November. Is that a 6-4-5? I can't read that. In October. 5-3. And October 7. I'm sorry. I can't really read it. And then at night, look at night time, man. We are doing it. They're talking about the tank god, the panches aren't playing. Holy, moly. And October, we had a 3-2-0-0-9 in men. And in November, we got a... Oh, oh! 0.5. Holy, moly. Let's work back at these many team posts. I'm going to slow up, though. Because we got a lot of time to kill anyway. We got like a 4-hour, almost 4-hour, 3-40. 3-40, day for those you keep it tracked. Right on your sleeve. 3 hours, 40 minutes. 3-40. Okay. What is it? I'm looking, though. I want to see the...what's the other sports station? Waxy? They still haven't changed the colors. Is it still...they're still waxing enthusiastic? Okay. One thing. Er...is scare America into too much. A little bit. One, one, one, three, one, eight. They're creeping along. And of course, that was during the political month. Come to November, month comes in after the election. They're going to fall off the face of the earth. We're going to... Mr. Eagle head. I don't know what he had. That's the overall station here, point. I don't...I don't...there's Waxy. One, one, two, one, three in man overall. I wonder about in the morning. I'm pretty bummed out about, steering getting only a 4-5 there in men, 18-plus, aren't you? That's not good. We needed more for him. Well, we needed more for him. We needed more diaries getting some people left to the left of Hitler for crying our lines. That, of all these right-wingers and Julio's getting the diaries. Same difference, I guess. Well, you know, the billboards are just... You know, they have a 10-chant. The billboards. They haven't had a chance to take effect yet. Well, of course, keep in mind November, like ends like in mid-November, like about the 18-for-20. Is something like that? The billboards to take effect. What is that? Oh, look at that. Waxy's making a move, man. Point nine in the summer. One point eight in the next trend. And then a 2.4 here. From 25th, all the way up to number 17. All out. They're making a movement, man. You can smell it all the way up here. There's a movement going on. A little increased there for our mascara, American. Not too exciting. How about in the mid day now? I'll deal with that 7.0. Right, man? How are you going to overcome that? They must add a huge September. They must add a, like an 88-share in September. That's going to disappear when it becomes the fall book of November, December, and September, FLOP's off either the world. It disappears. Like having your tail fall off, you know? Right? Yeah. Talk being a dinosaur in your whole tail falls off. And whom are I looking for? We got a 6-4. We did pretty good with a 7-O, and what's wrong with that? Is that chop lever? What a absurd haven't here? What a stern half. The high-powered one. power to one that we have to make way every day of ten o'clock to let the king of the universe on a stinking for six what's the big semis with that huh and he was going to get uh... carry in the white house and get bush to defeat in the audience and get some lesbian's in her to keep an entertain I don't see it man I don't see it how he four point six I didn't even mokin a dad that he has done that that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying maybe we got the wrong how it on the truth it's a but I'll be on to the for you can probably agree with me on that probably not much else for the real time now I'll get what copy of the numbers and get going ahead to tell the globe this is all I did pretty good to it and I have to laugh at me it all at this and the board on that's bad you are so full of crap man was all the comedy everyone I will say this I will say this you would all the hostility you know in fact that may for great radio and a lot of a setting drama back in fourth and yeah and once that left we had a show that's coming in from uh... syndicated from the work that has nothing to do with us that none of us ever get promoted on or talked about it it's you know where it it's a it's a show in a vacuum and not to take any credit away from stern who's got even after getting the uh... accolades for me he's got this great track record and all these major markets but to fact that a matter is now let me just take a look also in a more in their cf uh... the by showed up again that would be bad members of the school brought in guiding light they didn't kill fill up by the way let's see his daughter with the affony knows killed uh... and i will see the bus they did you show that one month before we had started on the biggest vanished they disappeared in our book they vanished in the thin air so i'm thinking it's more byproduct of the people of got the diaries again dammit then anything else but if that's the case how did we do a seven uh... just like that uh... uh... uh... and so that mister huh with uh... the great help from the staff of how do we do it uh... and i see that you go again getting sorry going to get current to turn on you again just when he was there were a little bit just when they started like cozy up to you little anyway i i just this this whole day today i wish i would tell you hey i'm getting on a plane at

talent like 30 years ago Better the live radio show every morning on TV well just about anything But that hasn't stopped him as NBC from teaning up with radio's original bad boy Who now looks like a nasty old ring listen for a name. I'm a cell and it turned us coffee Yes, every morning see I miss listen to a tape above their people's calendar. This live on the air I did I have it a bite into those month and also I have a fresh one play See his why he'll be behind the scenes at it I'm a year-old. Oh, I'm a cook cook at you and I definitely some fresh coffee in your fire He's irreverent so what's the deal to call? He's top of the what's the deal with his water game? He's in coherent. I'll tell you why that's Well, that's He's I've been standing story and he's only on MSNBC a cable channel nobody watches and a bunch of AM radio stations Nobody listens to them. I'm not so many got some fresh jingles. It's I'm 19 at five 60 WKOM. I just I don't get it. Where's the beef man? Where's the big meat Howard? I thought we were gonna like go scour lock any when we saw those October numbers right? I thought we were on a way that was the trend and instead we have to sit here Pean and our pants shaking our boots every day waiting finally for his majesty to clear the way so we can come on here See that's another thing he's in charge stern as in charge of those three serious stations We're they're gonna put to the you know they're gonna fill up board They're gonna get the talent from they got Lin Samuel's on from one to three every day, okay? Lin Samuel there's two oh Please cracker please But nevertheless the beat goes on Back up to you what I think I think what I'm gonna do is I'll play their game. I'll sound like I'll sign three different contracts with three different And these I was at Yeah, they're famous for doing that Here's a facts from Rick who says just go with a high-spitter that is not QA and Norma is a lazy bum You should have been syndicated a long time ago. You still could be a fintender if you do some of QM put a name no firing clause for George I mean, you know you're you're the meeting between Norma Kent and our general man where Greg we was last Friday And the day before was the day that not lied the week before but we could go Friday and the day before that was the day They dragged you in their twice to what a big son and answer about nothing with that inquisition That's that's always a real good tactic that maybe we're gonna meet to renew your top talent It's just only you should have the part of firema not QA and we want the fart sounds back Your transmitter is effing up again tell mighty ball and Norma to go pee on it at least if he didn't something useful Chances Rick there's Rick let's make him the program director at least he knows what's going on He knows where the bodies are buried he knows who's the real pee in the in the wood pile Man I'm gonna change the pool but I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna be influenced by the audience Okay, I have to decide what's right and what I said before what makes us think that these people are gonna change That's gonna have any more rock monus is never the Chinese call it any more rock monus for those of us on here who bring in the cash Right nothing nothing has changed. I don't even see clearance coming in there like you know You're giving you a kiss give me a Christmas present. He did what he give you a guess certificate clearance gave you that yeah Weekst change gets over here. Yeah I hear telling you he gave you a gift to a different for what Barnes and Noble that he bought I would assume with his own cash that what do you've written him out about? Maybe he's not so bad after all. I don't bitch amount. I like him Oh god I saw that movie gaslight I saw Yeah, I'm sorry about that What I hear he looked on the hates me. Oh he actually likes you What he says not what he told me. No, he doesn't I never said anything new I probably shouldn't be saying that on the air, but yeah, what if I say likes well, maybe there's some maybe if the beast like You know turns the other cheek so to speak now the beast has got that lovely girl I'm never gonna like me that much. I mean come on you never know there's like and then there's all I hear Parents has got a really high girlfriend now too is what I'm hearing yeah, you meter if you go to that Christmas party You could probably meter I guess I won't then be made you said you were gonna go and I'm not well why not you and this is the first time This is I've known you you worked on the show how many years 14 years 14 years 14 years this man is worked on this show And this is the first time and my recollections ever said I'm not going to Christmas party It's the first time that I've ever not gone into a Christmas party And so I just said party animal and confirming guy likes they likes to free food not so much of a company likes to free food in the booth Right, but this year not going because I guess there's some hard feelings there Now he ought to come in there right now clear us and give you like a big hug and a kiss Then I would feel better before I go on vacation for like eight or nine days I feel better about the way things were going I might be more inclined to sign that deal See the Think about the audience they don't understand two things say they really don't since the show is as degenerated in fact not degenerates So I'm right from the beginning from the time I said down here out of nowhere They don't understand I want to money. Okay. I'm not I'm not looking to be a superstar I give that up a long time ago and I realized my agent was a silly person. Okay. I mean That's it. I'm not looking to be a super. They're sure before this election I think I could have made a difference. I know that sounds egotistical and the arrogance I could have made a difference of the people not only here in the show We're to see the stories we have on there some of those people can have them right to them in the red states You know somebody could read the net stuff and maybe that might have made somewhere maybe. Oh, hi Oh, maybe just one state that might have turned this thing around you know All I know is the places where they show was heard carry one big huge in a place where they show was heard Not that they're not heavily democratic usually anyway, but he did pretty damn well right yes He don't play me don't play us we did our part and some of the other us eomaniax out there Talking to big trash. Oh, we're gonna get pushed to feed it and then the people who listen to them are for the most part not political They don't they don't even vote all they're looking for is a lesbian dilidate. Okay, with all the respect to Howard All I want to do is make fun of cripples in the watch dikes or you know He mode about dikes fantasize sit there with their hand on the shift on a gear shift and their truck 50 to what are I just get through Sam? I don't know but the next one I'm trying to convey is that you know I'm not gonna do what the audience tells me to do where all these people trying to suck around and puff up my ego Like I said I don't have an ego and number two I like the money coming and that's it simple And as for the rest of it if they want to screw us over and treat like crap Then I'll just tell them to wipe their ass with the deal. That's all they they ought to start having a little bit different attitude about the people that put the money on the bank And bring in these numbers. I'm looking at that seminar I thought maybe we had a mediocre month. We did just fine. It's bad the fact about when you're zir got a lot of diaries We did good we've gone wrong when you're looking at a four six and a four four and a half noon And we got a seven I think we're still like a king of the hell top of the road Tell whatever it is what's that song?

called the bodily functions aren't just literally with parts out here's my comment I've been listening for 13 years last week show when you're talking to I guess Josh and the beast I listen a book keep your arms around your just great short or any dope smoking pig and we got to stick together all right good luck in power and the beast was okay but he certainly he's just I'll tell you one thing clearance but they the beast I mean he can go in there Friday because nobody wants to work that day that that's where he can come in when nobody else wants it but today that day think he's going to level in there and any kind of a permanent position that's today that I level out okay depend on it get your life on bet Matty Bell's life on it 5 6 7 0 5 60 he's just a silly first okay he's just a wobbling as who knows nothing about anything you wouldn't believe the questions I was asking him did just just for fun but his his lack of knowledge about anything in the world other than you have been sports and the feeding it just not exist in the fact that his you know his folks have got a lot of money and he lives on brickle with their money and he went as going over the weekend with his girlfriend to the west coast to some big posh resort with their money and that's it he just a spoiled fat little rich dude that's all he is not rich but I mean you know it's full bread that's it but he puts out for clearance so therefore he's got an in double Q a m hello yes sir are you done pretty good you were talking about the signal I'm here in the house it no it does good can you hear me not not hear you fine okay well not a phone see the phone is fine right well the signal reference to the the station of community from kibba right well I don't hear that in the background like the music is up what I do here is when I'm driving around you're signal will like drop out and then the kibba station will come in and then you drive around a little bit further and then your that station will drop out and you'll come back in like you know something like really well but you know it's unusual on a and because on a and you'll get that right there's a drop out I'm sure you've heard that on fms your you know so many miles away from the tower because it's line of sight but on a and there's a ground signal so usually you don't just you know disappear well the way things that it happens to you and it doesn't happen to the stations that like rent on cash or for out of the way they have their stations messed up probably you'll probably you'll be on a had some to do with it thanks bali right and probably someone at the right way from propaganda and per and order from shop day down there from a little banana sweet water maybe that's what that's all about you think there you go maybe some of the some of the common issues of the galaxy to get to sky a block a mile because if they hear about it in kuba remember we used to get calls from kuba not a lot or postcard or two from kuba right we have a few listeners down there they got to make them and then you're part maybe they called them on and probably hold their ass off and they're waiting to do after the new year the rest of them too just one of them things that's one of the bad parts about traditional the terrestrial radio man it really blows never done that for years would probably ought to be on kiss see if normal is like a real agent if he was like a real hot tub he'd have said okay we'll continue this fiasco but Neil needs to be on FM on kiss from ten into every day on can you imagine that with a real signal their numbers were not accurate anyway already we don't have to change the call letters either we just change the logo a little bit instead of kiss country you could be kiss my ass right and every time then we could all we could judge any when I could take turns picking on us just you know to keep those people tuned in what do you want to take turns I'll do it all the time all year and of course with

And I thought of you because... He was the reason why. Yes. He was the reason why. Yes. As Mike Wallace is sitting across the table from Ricky. The year everything he was saying to himself, you know, which is more interesting. This interview or the one I did with Castro about 68. Yeah. But the X-Most Laws can do video. I've never seen him in the face of the year. But there's that tell you how desperate they are. I said I must have been a slow newsweek. You know, all these kids dying over in Iraq and all this stuff going on in the world. And they're interviewing Ricky Williams on 60 minutes. And they won't let you play a part bit. Yes. How do you like that? What's your life coming to? Well, it's not too bad when you come right down. Would you? You're in, you know, having a good life? Yeah.

And he said, and he wanted to say, how do you? How do you? How do you all, I think it's on the B. I told you, I don't know what it is, but there's something It's like that the scene in the hit your would see time is how and Mark your how are you know? Right. There's a weird bond there. Right. I think we both like finger food, something like that. I don't know what I'm doing. Yeah, that really is. There's kind of a a fun bond in there somewhere. And in addition to which, like I said, I did you show them the numbers. Did you tell them about that? No, I didn't. I don't have a many more. I remember I told you. Well, I mean, you can tell them that, you know, the Mr. Bigshot, there's a publicity here and a number that Mocha to Max. And I'm sure beaded if we go back and some of those trends without any problem at all. There's times we had like five something. I mean, a four or six in October, especially when we had a seven in midday, I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. That's not worth like the whole rest of the world sitting on the edge of the streets waiting for them to finally take their last breath and go home until we're finally permitted to come on here. Sorry, I just am not buying it. Where's the beef, baby? Where's the meat? Howie? Anyway, have a great the New Year and a great Christmas and a great the quads and subway with.
