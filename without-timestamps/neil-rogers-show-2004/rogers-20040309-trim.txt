What do you think more is thinking about in Kiyoli and Joe and all this other stuff after that very jackass Call them in a hell as once again Greg read continues programming and floating out travel wounds and bury jackass is column in his paper It's not I know embarrassing. It's humiliating and degrading Man, seriously suppose you got a contract and you working every day We know you're rating sucked like mo and everybody hates you like poisons like mo and all of a sudden you read in very jackass that We're considering putting Howard Stern on the morning. I Listening don't light a fire under my acid inspired me to do a much better show Well, maybe you're not capable of a much better show 2016 votes on yesterday's poll Why isn't a public up and arm and that way of apologize for your expelling but he's had a lot of stress stifle Kind of like sniffle right why is in the public up at arms about the government's efforts to stifle free speech Because they're too stupid to understand it 749 out of 2016 votes 37.1 percent because freedom of speech is just a saying in America She had written 61 Because the media is mostly ignoring a 34 they got bigger fish to fry like Martha Stewart, you know more important things than the first amendment Because they're lazy 258 Because they don't give a Schmidt 205 and because they don't have any leadership 99 2000 plus votes As people are just going to get a little bit pissed off a little bit fired up just like that guy to call for more land do yesterday Yeah, see I know his intentions were good. I know he's very frustrated and he's hitting with speechless which he just kind of like a stopped him in sense And I think he expired But you know, oh, we had a couple hundred people demonstrating for the clear channel of the station front of our later Well, that's that's you know very exciting and then what? There they went, huh? Right and got lead So what what we want to tell you again, we got the eight South Florida clear channel stations on there if you want to just Do avoid them like the plague is a protest that would that's one Positive thing you can do because in terms of finding somebody that's gonna really go to bad for you Forget about it just think what I happen especially in the election year There's nobody out there who wants to come to go to bad for potty mouth shot jocks and freedom of speech things like that right shock dog or speaking of the adedamerican soldier end of hot meals for US troops in Iraq question mark Says NBC news Halibird has got a multi-billion dollar contract to feed in how's US troops interact but there are problems multi-problemy A food subcontracted that runs 10% of the dining facilities and Iraq claims it hasn't been paid by Halibird in for months And it's threatening to stop serving hot meals The company eventsource serves a hundred thousand meals a day in a rack under a contract with a Halibird in subsidiary eventsource claims Halibird knows that $87 million including even payment for president Bush's thanks giving dinner with the troops without plastic turkey his When you get stuck out there for $87 million There's plenty of resource cheap executive officer fill them around the sequester beacon on X In an interview with NBC news. He says already laid off employees in the US and soon will have to feed sandwiches to the troops Instead of hot meals because his company is running low on money. They're running mighty low And your president's tell you oh we're gonna take care of our troops and we're gonna really appreciate our Iraq tragic just pathetic Don't forget that big primary election today in Florida. Oh, yeah Don't get that all straight now. No problem at all sure right because there's nobody running Here's the big story here's the QAM programming story of today by Barry Jackass and your Miami-Herald Here's line nine though for QAM Yes, sir Hi, this is Joe. Hi Joe You for now your hello yeah, go ahead Are you for God on your list yesterday that Yota put category for The people are afraid to Speak out. Yeah somebody suggested that but it's a little bit late now. There's a pull is over But that's that's possible Printed there. Oh phone is being tapped that tree of clock anymore. They're gonna get a knock on a door And if it's good to fight in the house and drag out There would be Okay, I'll see the border man will have a patrol or to pick up Leading could decide QM fate of Goldberg We're not talking about what be either I'll tell you one thing that better be a real good productive meeting 11 o'clock this morning Greg whatever your name is you idiot We're not gonna lose the hump right? Yeah, with it this station is it's like sitting inside of a building that's Infested with termites which I think that's a good analogy for our building right we have answered And and while you don't know you got to answer your pants, but they're made by be termites in a walls and end plays no exterminator I think what we need in that place is an exterminate Department of expression And it's like sitting inside of a in Infested building it is watching a crumble around you With what Greg read is due to QM it just just it's a grass being defeat from the jaws of victory He better do it than anybody I've ever worked for in my life. He just Non-composed penis that's Greg read it just there's nothing there Hank Goldberg status a WQM could be determined during a meeting this morning with general manager Greg read writes very jackass the mole What it's joke Goldberg has been kept off the essence marks the tooth following an author incident involving the anxious Lou and Winnick the station's general sales managerists and a miserable bitch at that If the meeting goes well Goldberg could be back on your four-clock today, but read said yesterday told very jackass He hasn't decided whether we'd hang Goldberg I don't know what'll happen read said it depends on how the meeting goes at 11 o'clock said Hank I'll hear what he has to say I talk to the van. We're okay Okay, it was a misunderstanding I'm contrite. I just want to go on On another matter and this I find most historically amusing Read said he was exploring the possibility of adding Howard Stern's morning Sure, if clear channels big one o six does not resume carrying it is big one o six Could have resumed carrying it no no there are two chances none and much much much much less than none and could have happened Is QM gonna be adding Howard Stern to our morning lineup? No no I'd say we have two chances also none and much less than none Although you see it's a little bit better than mother clear channel willers several less much is in here Hank gonna happen Now keep in mind that he's got people under contract like Moan Gildy Joe Rose is not only not on the contract but not even gotten paid yet in ten weeks of filling in He's got those people who think that they have a job right now Of course he's going in very jackass in the mommy here again programming floating out his Travel owns getting everybody peeing in their pants of salute and stirring up the same old tap that he always does that's great That is great So we'll keep our cuz we're only gonna be under 12.55 cuz we got the Marlon's and he amets at Portsink loosely a 12.55 the saffron.

He said we'll cross accepted 1918 at five 60 WQ on the reason I played that is because the disgrace former US figure skating champion and aspiring boxer Tanya harding Is going to try or hand next at minor league hockey Okay The Indianapolis ice of the central hockey league announced yesterday at sign harding 33 to join the team for its game Friday against the Colorado Eagles It's been 10 years since heart index has been hired a hitman to attack rival Nancy Kurgan at the 94 national championships That was a lot of fun What what I thought it was fun harding is always denied knowledge of the attack, but a pleaded guilty to conspiracy the Hindu prosecution Well script of her 94 national title and banned from eminent figure skating competition You know everybody's made mistakes. You said last month on the CBS early show Everybody's had tragic things happen in her lives, but what good is it to just sit there let yourself die is what Tanya said? Although she's been pursuing career in boxing harding is also seeking reinstatement from the West figure skating commission I'm one of the best skaters in the world. I'm not gonna quit. I love boxing. I'm not gonna quit boxing. She said Harding is scheduled with fight in Oakland, California if the hook under arena March 20. Can you say scumbag? That's come back the life I like it piece of crap She's a lot of fun. Oh, sure. With that now here's KP facts is me this and he says Why isn't the public up in arms about the government's efforts to stifle free speech or is that stipple? You should have included the choice because we're gonna let the bastards have it in November Well, I wonder which bastards is he talking about? It says it would have made by the way bad grammar here in this it would have made a huge difference in the outcome of your pull Keep preaching the good word Well, the good word in the bad word is that even if Kerry does beat Bush, which by the way we had the new pull he's ahead pretty good But even if he does win our Kerry's not supporting freedom of speech This isn't a democrat and Republican issue. This is a government issue. This is a sensitive issue. This is a lack of balls issue Nobody from either party except rest-fangled of Wisconsin. Nobody else has got the balls to stand up and say wait a minute Just how can you sit around a table and arbitrarily make up all of these idiotic rules which nobody understands in a first place and then say we're gonna slap your ass with a big gigantic fine Every time you say something we don't like and we can't tell you what that is, but we'll just like pornography. We'll know when we hear it Don't you know pornography when you hear it? Oh sure of hear it something now Who should John Kerry pick for his running mate that's our an of course it is primary day in Florida not that it means anything at all cuz everybody else dropped out Who should he pick for his running mate is our pull question today on your Rogers.com when you're through looking at Kerry Otis or before you look at Kerry Otis or Elias Or Otis or Edward 34 see that's leading and I knew he would but that's not the good choice See I want you to put on your thinking cap which I realize It's quite an amusing expression, but think about it for a minute See if you're gonna pick a running mate. It's gotta be somebody's gonna help you win somewhere Oh, in a concept right that's just because somebody is likable or because somebody came in second during the primaries or because somebody looks younger than he really is and has like a nice smile or stuff like that Somebody who actually like maybe when they're home state now if he's on the ticket You think you think you think that John Edwards with Kerry are you know as the presidential candidate Kerry Edwards to get his gonna win North Carolina? No, no, there's no chance there are two chances In fact, there's a better chance than Howard Stern will be on from six a.m. till midnight on Qm starting tomorrow There's a better chance of that happening than the bush that the Kerry Edwards ticket winning North Carolina Now we're else Kenny win Well, what other state will he help carry? Kerry I don't know Nebraska carry Otis Ha ha ha ha ha John Edwards 39 Bob Graham 24 Bill Clinton 13 now. I don't know if you put that story on a website or I did what I was on vacation I did I did you yes, I read that with much fascination I read it in its entirety and of course The reason it was fascinating is because there's nothing in the constitution that prohibits a president from being elected vice president I even looked it up you can only get two terms as president, but you can also then get two terms as vice president It's right it just says that they can't be elected Right John Edwards 39 Graham 24 Bill Clinton 13. That's why voted for I think a Kerry Clinton ticket man I like it we could get Monica back there give her some to do I don't care on for bush 10 people 8.9% so far I don't care period 10 more 8.9% they just refuse to care They're just professionally oblivious they're in their own little cocoon nothing is gonna shake them up Hillary Clinton 9 so look at that Bubba's got 13 Hillary's got nine She does nothing for me. Well. She does something to me, but I can't say it on hearing Bill Richardson 3 that's the who the effect of the theory thinking about injecting in there. He's a good guy I don't know who he is he's the Governor of New Mexico former Rob ambassador Oh, that guy. Yeah, he's got a good mouth out of New Mexico guy. He's a hood one of your people Well, not exactly Peter he's kin It's hard to I don't understand why the kevarts all I got to even though he's boring, but he is from Missouri and Missouri is a very crucial state that Bush won in 2000 and I guarantee M. T. That if it's a Kerry Gammhart ticket that he wins for him Missouri and maybe even Ohio because of his union strength See what I'm saying But don't confuse the people with the facts because they're just emotional and that's the way elections go Bill Nelson to our fine other Florida Senator a lot of people are talking about him although Behind the closed doors no I'm saying another with you won't turn on the news and hear them cover for example Bobby Graham was on this morning VDI Bobby Bill Nelson to and Tom Brokaw won we have a story on our website today about the urgent Tom Brokaw to run And remember when somebody called me up last year and said oh Tom Brokaw's a Republican you're wrong bull crab He's a Kennedy Democrat always has been and I don't know where they come up with his garbage Tom Brokaw's got one out of 141 votes so far What a vote sir, poor and speaking of both Kerry leads Bush and the new nation wide poll Presented Democratic nominee why did they say that presumptive Democrat who who's they're gonna win a percentage Al Sharpton Kalon you idiots CNN man certainly not news that is grace. Oh a good piece of news They were showing some political rally on the CNN when I was in Europe I was watching CNN international in the background of the CNN reporter They had a bunch of people with big gigantic signs that said CNN Well the band symbol threw a CNN sucks or whatever it was great and then finally they cut on that those signs with it. We just lost a picture John Kerry leads Bush and later CNN USA Gallup poll USA today Gallup poll The poll released yesterday found that among likely voters Kerry gets 52% bush 44% In a three-way race with later throwing his a trigger in a wood pile carry had 50% bush 44 and later 2% So you see the 2% he takes are from carry In spite of all his denials miserable bastard self grandizing either this anybody who votes for Ralph Nader this fall by the way We'll be taken away and you won't see them no mole. I didn't know. It's not a threat. It's just a promise anybody votes for Ralph Nader will not be seen no mole Among registered voters carries leader for Bush Nader from 8 points to 5 in a 2 a race and from 6 points to 2 a few a race So again, Nader's already sticking his finger in it and burning it twisted in it around Well, we got a lot of stuff here today, you know good and we're only until 1255 because it had fallen's game WQM your Marlon station hello Hello, yes, sir God How are you guys pretty good?

This is a great email that you send me though that you fact From Pablo who says Neil you're profound the states for the Christians is as a Yeah, it's great is and it's core idiotic your daily pontification of the subject is both offensive Decrisions and also educated non-Christians So there is absolutely nothing anti-Semitic about Mel Gibson's movie the passion that I ever say that was anti-Semitic movie No, you're courted. I write about 4000 columns that they all did save so they must all be obnoxious and full of crap too Sure, there's nothing anti-Semitic those Jews who find that not to be the case should re-evaluate their own faith or lack they're out And I would like to put out that most of the articles like the month from the Toronto star or by yesterday was written by somebody Jewish but nevertheless Your constant bashing of this movie exposes your inability to be objective in most subjects You consider yourself to have integrity out for you this point a true media person objectively watches the film prior to forming an opinion I would waste my time watching it Pablo and by the way get a real name schmuck The left-wing media which you are obviously a part of truly has eliminated you ability to provide objective points I'm not here to provide objective points. I'm here to give my opinion. Okay, the post-master is supposed to give you his opinion It says funny thing. I'll even Steven Spielberg director of something a pro Jewish movie which was excellent And did you wipe that out or he do it? I didn't I didn't want anything out.

How do you like that Pablo? You are disgraced at the radio station. They disgraced your profession and most of all I disgraced a man Thank you Pablo. I'm ego It up yours. I might not care you're made as you're disgraced to women to right well Needless to say is grace to spagotry.

I'll tell you not just Christianity But duty is him and Islam and all of these things all of these fairy tales They're all equally anxious all of the problems in the world today everywhere you look even this thing and Iraq now It's the Shiites and the Sunni's man. What are we talking about good old-time religion? That's the problem I never realized until this last trip of mine I don't know why because I'm just not a history buff like you are I never realized the agonizing history of the Protestants against the Catholics in England. I know that we all know about huh every time there was a new king all these people would get their heads chopped up Right because they were on the wrong side Catholic king and then they had to like squeeze his ass out of there That's why we had the church of England out of make sure that everybody's gonna be the impromison and we keep them damn Catholics out of England Oh, we got to be able to divorce now set him up to Scotland me Well, and the bus I actually took a bus from the hotel to the airport leaving the Amsterdam water sloth I don't know why And It was there was a bunch of scuttmen got on a one-hole tell where they made the stop They were 13 of these guys they all looked like they came out of a cookie cutter like the same for all all those big like rugby players You know right rugby what they were the kids real Well, there were some people wearing kills in front of the hotel over the weekend, but that's not what they can't know these guys weren't killed We're in kills, but they should have been killed and they were they weren't speaking English most of the time They were speaking as if Celtic they speak a what what language are these people?

No sweat They play the race card. We'll see there. We go. Again speak of that and it's just a coincidence. This happens to be next in my pile Jason Williams says I chugged After slang says the New York doing news today Jason Williams told a key defense expert he chugged up to 18 ounces of scotch after he killed his limo driver A scenario that we're saying why his blood alcohol level was so high eight hours after the shooting court document show Totally so sensitive. So far how's his show coming by the way? Is it still on here? It's no come on We need a Rick Sance has TV show spy report. How much did that the Pablo's watching it right now? It says but so far no one was in the retired net stars role. No jersey manch and early February 14th 2002 is testified to say Williams drink as a state police investigation into the shooting was unfolding they didn't seem to dig nothing Instead Testimodia is manslaughter trial which was postponed yesterday due to the death of defensive Trinity Joseph Hayden's mother has presented details of heavy drinking by the Xthly during the four hours before he fatally shot cost as grusk a Gus Christophe The four hours before he did the shooting The first thing that Williams drank liquor after the shooting was contained in a previously underscores report by Dr. Michael Baden A man-hatton forensic pathologist heard by the defense member him from the O. J. trial Yes Dr. Bodden Baden whatever's name is Bodden stated in the December 5th 2002 document that he understood that the defense might introduce evidence Williams to approximately ten ounces of 80 proof Scott shortly after the shooting January 26, 2003 Bodden that with Williams a disomer the former superstar gave me demonstration Mr. Williams advised me that after the shooting he was completely destroyed he took the bottle to the head to her three times He took the bottle to the head His demonstration of this for me was a commonly referred to as Chugging Bodden wrote in the May 13th 2003 report using a Scott bottle filled with water Williams took three large swigs while Bodden calculated the consumption at between four and six ounces of fluid with each Chugg or swallow he concluded Williams would have ingested at least eight possibly up to 18 ounces Scott immediately after the shooting Williams blood alcohol level tested .1248 hours after the shooting a prosecution witness Dr. John Verkestimated Williams a consume 15 to 16 drinks prior to the shooting prior to the shooting Brick extrapolated that Williams blood alcohol reading would have measured as high as 0.25 at the time a 12th of a gauge truck that he was holding his charge in a Christophie's chest Bodden another defense experts contended brisk methodology was flawed said his findings failed to consider possible post shooting consumption prosecutors dropped plans to call Brick at the trial after Judge Edward Coleman offered to hearing out his methods and credentials. So there you go there's the latest in the Jason Williams he's going to get off to a trial what do you think uh never convict him I know what small potatoes who do you rather see in jail Martha Stewart or Jason Williams he there's the problem with America oh Jason Simpson he's busy stealing satellite signals alleged on the outside he killed two people in cold blood Martha Stewart even though we hate that bitch she's going to wind up doing some time in a slime or I think it's outrageous so she lied you know it's so big deal she was stupid like most rich people and never have enough great greedy she was worth a billion dollars she did this thing to say 50 grand she would have lost 50 grand I don't like you said she's got more in her wallet any given time she's got more in her wallet than 50 grand that's pocket change 50 grand her is like 50 cents you average shwuck out there so she was greedy she was a bitch and you're all these other things but in a meantime put her in jail what's that

at five sixty w qm so speaking of religious nuts i'm in a airport in the you know when you go on the international flights they're like two prop prop processes okay when you check in at the gate first they put you through a uh you have an outer waiting area and then with a get ready to board about 20 minutes before they're actually going to board the plane they have an interweight area where you sit after they take the past port in your boarding pass etc so this flight is just jam packed 400 people in my luck i'm sitting across from this uh schmatha head family uh the two guys they're like uh you know they just guys talking about the bio old uh and the woman she's got the full regaea she's got the whole outfit you know the berkid hold deal and uh right so and i don't want to say anything but she looked like uh guy i mean her hands you never hear our hands but like a hands of a man okay i guess it's maybe like a middle eastern thing i don't know what it is so she decided about 20 minutes before we're gonna get on the flight that it was time to pray okay and she's consulting with her um um two male whatever the relationship was uh where she can find a place to do it so she goes to the end of the uh seats where it's like a uh clear area there you know i mean maybe four or five feet she uh roll out the carpet just while she didn't have a carpet she didn't have a portable one with her i guess but now she's standing there and she's like like that but one more the one maybe speaking in tongues with the middle east well there's you i'll get to that don't push it now i'm not pushing that into these things right and of course some of the past and you're getting a little bit uncomfortable just kind of like the people on that american iraans flight that you know yeah yeah when the pilot came on and said he don't believe in Jesus you're crazy hey let's go have a good flight now yeah and she's been doing well and now she starts of course getting down on the floor and she's like uh i tried not to watch as much of it as I could because it was making me a little bit uncomfortable as well i had out of taking my camera forward and captured the moment oh man and of course being the hidden that i'm thinking of myself why did you do this before you asols came to the airport why are you doing this here now because it wasn't pray time then why are you inflicting this on everybody now what the floor show come on and think about all the things in a world about indian pacestin which both have the big bomb by the way you know we got the Hindus in the six remember that kid that called in one day a year ago when the show said i'm sick and i said i'm a go see a doctor's a good idea Hindus in the six you got the Protestants in the Catholics in northern Ireland you got the the Jews in the Muslims in the Middle East and of course the Christians want their peace too sure even my relansky wants a little peace i'm in raw everywhere you look that's what it's all about you got these sheites and the Sunis i mean when you stop and think about this in a media the media presents this is though it's some kind of a rational thing you know right as as though somehow these people are different well they're different all right because they believe different fairy tales or they came from different you know parts of the country whatever the hell do you want pick your poison that's what it's all about so don't don't give me a solid answer about the passion of the christ and all the other because all religion doesn't it does his breed a hate that's what it is it's a weapon to breed a hate and to excuse intolerance against other people and i'll say it again the greatest contribution i could make is if i could get one person as audience in all the years i've been on the earth so i've floored about thirty minutes twenty eight years to abandon their to to emancipate their brain and think about how ridiculous all this garbage is this that they've been brainwashed with that's quite the accomplishment that shows you how difficult it is they're always talking about when it back in the days when i did topical radio which was really boring but some of the shows i enjoyed a lot what are ones about the religion and we'd have these people on to discuss the programming young people from cults yeah and my favorite question these experts always was what what is a cult and what's a real religion right of course they had their standard answer well you know a real religion has got a cult has got a strong central figure oh you mean like he's a hope you'd like to pop well any of these things you know and no matter what the answer was that would come back would it it was a one of those interchangeable answers that you could put in anything you know very sad it's just what separates catholicism and all the Protestant cults and Judaism is that they just better businessmen and the Muslims forget about it they make you know for you can't refuse not like the Christians ever did i like like i just said i just got through with them don't be picking on them Christians again your buddy Pablo be waiting for you outside the studio there at the 1255 okay yeah 23 passed a lot and i'm concerned about the humpar waiting for that decision from the big meeting between Greg Reed and the humpar and Hank Goldberg the brain trust is meeting with the humpar right now to try to straighten his act out i thought i had him calm down for years ago but you know every now and then you just like you said some people inspire one right that that's right she sure did it to me you've been for I started on the air did the day I had a uh actually we were on the air no we were on the air we were in that studio downstairs uh prepared to be on air remember all the work that we did there and she comes down and she says now how many spots it already would be agreed to and of course it was 14 it was 16 16 16 no was 14 16 and she she stormed out and i made some kind of a crack some kind of a nasty miserable crack is only screw-in when it can do and i'm i my blood was boiling and i remember going up that elevator the third floor and just chasing around to try to find where she was and of course at that point she decided to wear closet herself with Greg or somebody in an a meeting and i was just muddling and mumbling to myself and he even started on the air yet on qa so i know all about what it is with that screw-in bitch and i'll say again Hank instead of getting suspended instead of getting a dressing down or even a dress what is it dressing down and under a single he should get an award for honesty for having a balls to tell like it is and don't give me a son to dance about what do they call it the unfriendly workplace they hostile and i'm working right because i can't think of too many more hostile work environments than qa m that's a movie yeah especially when he's there really in the day w qa and hello w qa and hello good morning yes sir hope i'm

I'm thinking about tomorrow's pool. I don't know what inspired me to do this. Well, I know what inspired me. That did I just played with all the states. Hmm. And I'm thinking of myself, we never did this pool. What is the most obnoxious state? I don't know how to phrase it. You know what I mean? The most unlivable, the most... What state do you despise the most? As far as what? This is far as anything. Just a... you grow test-place to visit or live where you don't want to be there. Where would you like to... which state would you lease the state with? Well, I mean, floor I dumb, I'd be one. All I got some nice beaches and there's a few nice people around. Not third man. Yeah. You'd be worse speaking. I'd be the worst place. What? I've been to worst places. Right. Oh yeah. I would never go... I would never go to... right. Or South Carolina. They have beaches. Georgia? Beach. Beach is... and beaches. Yeah. I'm thinking, well, I'll have a list of 50. I'm not going to show you that. We're not leaving anything off. I'm thinking Indiana might get some votes. Indiana wants you. Indiana wants me and I'm not coming back to how Indiana... or even the Sturgis, Michigan. Michigan's pretty good place. Ever been to Michigan? Yeah. Not a bad place. Whether it's horrendous, but whether it's not everything, man. Whether ain't everything. Trust me when I tell you. You know what a nice place was? What's that? Salt and talked about Madison, Wisconsin. Whenever I know Wisconsin, I'm free from religion foundation. It's just a very nice, clean, pit-resk, kind of little town. Right. Well, little city. Leafs signed a fence and a collage, a hands-in, by the way. I know you're concerned about that. All right. Have you do these stuff going on? Yep. I see some people with them advice. Any good morning. Oh. I change channel just in time. David Crossby, this is an old story from the weekend. And here it is Tuesday already. And we never get around with this. Did you talk about this? You couldn't have because it was on Saturday. Nope. Famed Rock and Roller David Crossby was arrested early Saturday after a hotel made found weapons and marriage a wini in a suitcase. He'd accidentally left behind her in a short stay in Midtown Manhattan. Weapons and marriage a wini. Crossby 62 already had checked out of the double tree sweet hotel. At 1568 Broadway, where returned to our water clock in a morning recovery piece of luggage he'd left behind, police said. After we left however, make clean, gizroom found the bag in place for notified of its contents. A 45 caliber gun. Two magazines of ammunition, a hunting knife, a folding knife, a pocket knife, and a small bag of weed with rolling papers, quote officials said. Crossby called the hotel to say, let the bag in his room. That's always this smart thing to do. When he returned for a police were waiting and charged him there with criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of marriage a wini. He was around just before by the clock Saturday in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan. Or just as Robert Strauss said bail a 30,500 bucks despite the fence attorney Daniel Parker's request a wave bail and released a musician on his own record of assistance. Crossby appeared tired in court war, loose dark pants and a t-shirt reading a man in his truck. It's a beautiful thing. He left by a side exit, next scheduled appear in court may 19, Parker would not comment. How do you like that? Poor David Crossby just can't stop, you know it? He just can't shut off the crap. Like me, I can't shut off the fat, same thing. Tensher off the Beninger's ice cream coffee coffee crunch. Oh god. Chucky. Yeah. Toysy really watching hip hop artists will you shut up, speak in a land, although it's a good segue. Toysy really watching hip hop artists in Miami. They're watching you. They're monitoring you. Miami and Miami Beach police are secretly watching keeping dossiers on hip hop celebrities like P.D.D. and DMX and their entourage is when they come to South Florida. Police say is to protect the stars and the public protect us from hip hop. Please. Often as they photograph rappers as they arrived at MIA, they stake out hotels, nightcubs, and video shoots. They can sell the six inch thick blank binder of every rapper and member of his or her group with an arrest record in the state of New York. The binder begins with a photo and rap sheet of Grammy nominated rapper 50 cent. 50 cents. It ends with job rule. Both men are embelled in one of the most bitter feuds in hip hop industry. One that M&M 50 cents producer is worn in the song Boy, could lead the bloodshed. One that rapper few. The police in the upper of top entertainers, which hip hop experts criticizes unnecessary stereotyping was created to protect the public and musical celebrities who chose to make South Florida their destination to live in party. Like I said, who chose to make South Florida and I can't even find it empty now. How do you like that? Party. Yeah. Can you believe he's dead? Yeah, I was just thinking about that earlier. Wow. That was psychic you are. Don Cox's dead. He's sleep on with a fish as well. I just can't believe that. Have you? Hey, can we interrupt just briefly because I'm trying to get a message to this guy in New York. A message to Waka. The guy that is always fatsing books. He's a good guy. I'm sure he's listening to me. Me, me, as well. He's got good intentions. But all day long he faxes 10, freakin 20 page fatses. Just faxes. Fatses. Third man. First page. If you're going to fax it all or don't. All day long. Hmm. From this guy. His love is a lot already. We do value. Attaches are good. But to bug off. First of all. This is pissed off and fired up in New York. We can't read your fax machine for some reason. The system might be police chief Charles Press says we have to keep an eye on these rabble reads the last thing we need in this city is violence. We want to know violence and software. Government agencies keeping tabs on musicians is not new. The Nixon administration investigated former Beatles Johnlin and the 1970s. Tread have deported. The band body kind led by rapper iced tea got the attention place naturally in the early 90s. With a song cop killer. But those cases involve individual artists and groups not moderating across a musical genre. There's been no shortage of rock stars in the musician scrutinized by police and Anthony Decurdis contributing editor at Rolling Stone. But there's never been anything like this. Look at the times in which we live. You see what I'm saying? Speak in the John Aschron. Several music executives in legal scholar Sadie intelligence gathering highlights the misunderstanding between the police and a $10 billion industry. The police they continue to use the slings of high profile artists like to pack the notorious BIG and run DMC's Jam Master J to justify tracking many in industry. I mean, did not all scumbags are they? I don't know the moment. Oh, some people see gangs in hip hop artists as being synonymous with Benjamin Chavez, president and chief executive officer of the hip hop some of action network. Oh man, a government watchdog and hood of registration group. Yeah, the hip hop some of action network. Right. That's a mistake. He said the recording industry is a legitimate American enterprise. Not a gang. But set a treaty Bruce Rogo. This kind of conduct shows insensitive ability to constitutional limitations. It also implicates racial stereotyping. Rogo successfully represented two live crew when the rapper was prosecuted for obscenity in the early 90s. And you want to know why they were prosecuted in the early 90s? Why? Oh, God. Because they so dirty, man. They so dirty, Sheriff. That's a lot of work. Speaking of obscenities, here's the fact that says the Rick Sanchez show is still on the air, but you can tell they're dying over there. The film would yell like it. Mostly they're doing plenty of vacation giveaways and prizes by watching the show to get the secret word or phrase. So even if the show is puked and dozing, the stay at home numb nuts will watch in hopes of winning something. Besides, it's good comedy as they wait for Oprah. Side note. Wow. Phil Henry shows being bleep left and right and they don't play him live anymore. It's mostly reruns with all the bleeps of the previous day with stuff cut out or bleeped. How do you like that? Are you sure? No, sure. This is I hope he's still loving, uh, looking the bush mice director what he and his people are doing. Well, that's what happens. Just like Howard, same thing, sucked up to the bush mice before a long time. Didn't do any good. Soon as he had changed his tool a little bit. Bye bye. Bye bye, sir. Myster. By the way, something. Yes. Thanks as. Thank you. He loves you. What everything worked out, Hank. No, Hank is great. Hank is legendary. Hank doesn't have to prove it. And then what really I resent bitterly. And I mean this bitterly. You remember when we before we started in Hank had that run in, was the first suspension. See, which I don't do suspensions. I mean, if you don't want to pay me, then we'll see in court. I don't play in the middle of that. That's right. I'm there and if you don't want to let me on here, then we'll go to court. I haven't any meetings. But that first thing, which was a total lie. And Tom Jick exposed Greg Reed for the liar that he wasn't a newspaper at that time. Uh, the business about well, he picked out Wayne. I was saying that in the food and the press box, they had nothing to do with it. It was all again about screw-in and fill us the award or not. See, two of Greg's bunk bunk buddies there with the station for many years. And that's what it was all about. He didn't treat them nice. And so he got suspended without pay. And then it goes through all kind of crap. And I remember in those days, Greg rattling his spirit. Oh, I don't know if I want to have Hank on our staff. All of the crap. Well, since those days largely thanks to me and my tone, Hank, take the check to the bank. Hank, let's be a listen. Take the money. The banks weed are please. Ignore more ons like Greg Reed and screw-in at bitch. Just take the money straight to the bank tomorrow's pay. They put a smile on your big bet, post. Equities and so much. So now here we have the same thing all over again. Based on the guys of, well, it's a hostile, a work environment that he's making his comments in a hall. A big thing can deal. Okay, grow up. Grow up, Greg. Now, what does this thing about a woodpecker here? Is this two clean up? I don't know. I don't do it. I don't do it. I saw that word woodpecker. That's you and for me. I'm not going there as they like to say. Don't even go there. Girl, would you like that expression? But guess what? I'm not going there. Just like you said about the South Carolina. I'm not going there. No, I'm not going there. I wish I had to pass through there. What either woodpecker? Not going there. Let's see. Studio script notes on the passion. They've hated the Steve Martin. Is this amusing or not? It's cute. Scordor out. Dear Mel, we love love the script. The ending works great. You're going to be getting call from us to start negotiations for the bookrise. Written in Mel Gibson. Of the Jesus character. So like, I don't want to read this. It's just cute. I don't want to do it because we get Pablo all upset again. He's probably a... The film would be like, in painting himself on something sharp right now. I'm going to do something. Oh, I'm sure. And that could be it. So the police are secretly watching the hip-hop artists in the South Florida. They're so keep your, we just covered yourselves according to it. It's all I can tell you. I feel better now. Good. And now you'll be in a good place we can be safe. Who should John Kerry pick is his running mate? That's our poll question. But I don't, don't miss Kerry Otis. He's our sunshine girl today. We hope that's. We hope that's. Oh, just behind the beaded curtain. John Edwards, 2012 oughta be the running mate. And you know, I don't have a problem with that. Although I don't see the great political strategy there. I don't see what the big game is. Do you? With John Edwards. Right. A new England kind of guy with a pick for the balance ticket. But what's what states in the South is, John Edwards going to help John Kerry win if there are swing voters in the South. That's the idea. Yeah. Well, did now for when Florida last time? Right. He did. I mean, they stole it, but he wanted it. Nevertheless. In other words, he'll swing more votes in that direction than say, Joe Lieberman. But you're missing the point. Well, you're not talking about Julie, but he's not even on a list. We're talking about somebody who might win him some state, who might win in the election by having him on a tick. I don't see where John Edwards fits that bill. I don't care if he's got 90% of these votes because it was pretty typical from the beginning when we started taking a poll. They say, oh, John Edwards, because that's what they're supposed to say. They think, you know, I go to for gram on the poll and just talking about what they are saying. I voted for bubble myself. Yeah. I ain't going to happen, but sure. Well, well, sounds great. That's the ideal idea. 610 votes. 610. Oh, my God. You know what? 610 votes. Holy. 610. Wild. Oh, I hate that stage. That's another cheap channel station. Another one good piece of news is that I don't see a lot of crossover between Lardaz Limbaugh, that Hill Pop and Phonohympacrit, right wing asshole. I don't see a lot of cross over between him and Howard Stern. So why don't think that the people who listen to Howard were pissed off at their channel. They're going to have to give up anything that they like, like Rush or the Schmidt, my serena, that crap. Because they don't listen to that stuff anyway. Right. 610 votes. Edwards 213. Graham 104. Good old BDI Bobby. Bill Clinton 100. I don't care. I'm for Bush 58. I'm in half percent pretty weak. Hillary 34. I don't care period 34. No matter what you say. Dick and Hart's got 20. General Wesley Clark 20. Bill Riches in 13. Tom Brokeaus about eight. And Bill Nelson. And I like that name. He's got six. We're supposed to win you five six. You a M. Mr. Kenny. I like to relax by having Mary Magdalene massage my balls while listening to the Neil Rogers welcome on our. Hey. From the makers of the passion of the Christ comes. Passion of the Christ. On ice. All the violence of the movie you loved. But with a triple axle crucifixion. See columns of graceful Roman soldiers whipping and weaving around a magnificent Messiah. And your time reports these skaters really nailed this one. And USA today says jumping Jesus Christ on ice is cold blooded fun. Bring the kids to witness and save your each moment they cross. The grace, the glory and the suffering of Christ on ice. How do you think this is going to be a good day today? Yeah. It's a great day. George our polls are dead sentence for John Mahamad. He's going to get off in October and tomorrow. Lee Boyd Malvo gets a he's going to get his. You're going to get sentenced tomorrow. So that's some excellent news. We got the Marlins and the Metz coming up from Port St. Louisley at 1255 a set known. So that's even better news because we get on here early. And then the Marlins fans are just hanging on on the edge of their sentence. And in order to Marlins fans are just hanging on on the edge of their seats waiting for every pitch by the coma inducing Dave. Van Boring. Well that's really yeah that's criminal. That's pathetic. Wait ten years this. President Bush's chief political advisor Carl Roe of Tool the FBI and interview last October that he circulated and discussed damaging information regarding CIA operative Valerie play with others in the White House. Outside political consultants in journalist according to a government official and attorney for the media on going special counsel's investigation of the matter. But Roe also adamantly insisted to the FBI that he was not the administration official who literally the information that claim was a covert. CIA operative to conservative comments Robert Novak last July. Rather Roe insisted only circulated information about claim after the period Novak's column. He also told the FBI the same sources said that circulating the information was a legitimate means to counter what he claimed was politically motivated criticism of the Bush administration by claims husband. Former ambassador Joseph Wilson. You want to think you folks have to understand you better get it right now get right it down on your arm like in a mental. Okay. We do not criticize the government. No got it. We have vays. That's right. The US you don't criticize the government. No criticize our president. The vice president. You don't criticize the uh secretary defense the secretary state the secretary of the interior the exterior. The posterior. None of these things. Back home got it and you certainly don't criticize condolese. The national security adviser that's right. Don't even think about it. Too late I thought about it. Well you're done. Oh, and Crofts are now underway and they're showing the uh look at that they're showing the lapar scopic where they stick it. They're going to stick it through. Little hole in the abdomen in your belly. We go in with what looks like a pair of scopes and they put a little bag around the golf. They got a little panicky there because they discovered the hole in a crosshead and they thought she did we drill in a wrong place. Back though. And that one too. Dig one. Did they find his black heart? 567. 560 pound five 60 on the eight his black part pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. So the surgery's underway. I certainly hope it's over successfully and he has several good volumetric later in the day so we can weed about it with papers like I's now. Look at that foam man. That's what I think is for a new one. Okay, do we need to sterilise? Jay Jew and Americans. Good. Good for you. That's it. That's the end of our calls today. I'm telling you these days when we have Marlon's baseball it's a mixed bag. On one hand it's real blessing to get out of here early on the other hand. Man they started diving away from that radio dial. This in case they might hear a pitch. WQM hello. Hello. Hello, that's the interlocal today. I'm telling you these days, but we have mothers here. We got a lot of internal. Yes. Hey, you're so proud. Okay, thank you. This flash. Yeah. That's the real bulletin. Another one of your people by the way. That was probably what's his name? What's his name? Pablo. Pablo's boyfriend. Hello. Hello, Neil. How are you? Okay. Listen, I'm pissed off. I bought the FCC going back here. Do you want to go back to you? Is this the question? Yes. I am pissed off. I want you to know that. Another thing is, I'm praying that Ask God's eyes is surgery right now. Okay. Well, it's going on right now. So we'll give you a play by play. Well, let's you know how it all comes out. 567. He got his John Ask God Food Who Dollars. Probably sticking to pin right in the back though. Right as we speak now. The anxious attorney general, man, just in a disgrace. A man who's covering a boobies on statues. A man from the Stone Age. Wow. He makes fundamentalist Christians look like 10 Kennedy, like Raving Liberals. That's how far to the right he is. Your attorney general, they're working. WQM. Hello. Neil. How are you? Okay. Yeah. I'm also pretty pissed off about the FCC too. And what's really amazing is that the FCC got the largest amount of public input regarding the media mergers, you know, and the expansion of the network. Yeah. They got, what was it? 19 million. That was right. And they still don't care. They still because they're in bed with Viaconna with the, with Chief Channel. They don't give a grant. Yeah. But 0.01% of the population is upset about the Janet Jackson Boob. And I thought like a major benefit. But the other thing that I really wanted to talk about is this religion and wars thing that you were talking about a little while ago. And I thought, yeah. Well, you know, the United States is the country. If you read that there's a big no-resince key book called the Ask and Trap, he discusses on there how under the Carter administration and after the Carter administration too, they were funding the Mujahadim and Bin Laden, you know, to uprise against the communism. Right. And you know, it's, you can say this about Pakistan and it's rise to power and all of their... You're going through all of those, you're, you're wearing me out. Your, your, your intentions are good. But we know all of this. Sodom was our man and those, so it was our man because he was fighting to risk his, the communist and baby doc was our man and Papa doc before him was our man and everything was our man. Yeah. And, you know, when you support dictators, that's what, what happens all over the world. And then they will fear you. And they will hate you like poison. That's what's having to work in a day where despise, we've filed all around the world. Not so much as individual people but the American government, now they fear us like crazy. They're peeing on their good way either. No. In a bad way. WCWM, hello. Yes sir. Yes sir. You think John S.Cop is making the doctor's operate while he has his pajamas on. Last I heard you had to be new. When you had an operation. That was a good day, buddy. Something to think about it. Okay. You think he's wearing his P.J. You get one of those gowns that are open. Oh, he ain't going to be wearing no gown. That's not a manly thing for a guy like our attorney generally wearing some kind of a gown. Maybe he can wear it backwards. Oh, brother. With a flat in front. I can't say that. Ah, a backward. Sorry. A backward. Right. 567.0560. Pound 560. On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. A great day at QAM. The Humper survives another 10-by-grid weed Just grow a bank. Just stick it to him. Take that money right to the bank. Just laugh all the way. And don't stop it any drive through either on the way to the bank. Please. That's the only thing I'm worried about. You're wrong, Sam? What are you saying? Well, I'm saying that there's a lot of, you know, every street court is another Mickey D's. There's Wendy's in Arizona. I see. Pop eyes and all of these things. So just make the effect. How that they have these newfangled cars that have the, what the hell do they call them? Wheel. Yeah. Steering wheels. No, they have the radar stuff where you're going to find, you know, the locator like the GPS. Right. How do they get it? Exactly. Very good. Oh, Josh is there. And then it's for the driver. No, seriously. When I have that kind of stuff, what you ought to be able to do is like, set it automatic and go like, wherever you were going to the bank. With no ability to stop in between. Other than that one, you have to stop for traffic. But no ability to make any pit stops. You want to say? Or the doors lock so you can't jump out. Right. That's right. And the window is locked too. So you can't roll the window down and, you know, get that sack handed through the window. That big fat sack. Oh, speaking of sack, there's George Teneth. And what I did or what I didn't do is. But it would be, but it would, but about, yeah. Sure. Tell us another story, George. Who should John Kerry pick for his running mate. We asked on the rojus.com today. 660 votes. That ain't too shabby. John Edwards 227 Bobby Graham 114. Bill Clinton 1110. We want Bubba back. I don't care on per bush 62 9.3% of people who just absolutely refuse to be swayed by the truth. I don't care period 36. Hillary 34, Wesley Clark 26, Dick Gavar 21 people all up for Dick. Bill Richardson 14, Tom Brocott 10, and poor Bill Nelson's only got six, six. He's only got six votes. How to 660. That ain't too good. Yeah. Anyone on the why? Nobody wants who that is. Nobody knows who that is. If you went out on the corner of 441 and I was very road right now and you found anybody who's smoking was. And we said, you know who Bill Nelson is and they'd say, Hey, they look at you with that strange look. Or if you went on the other side of the street and asked that question, they might say, John, just before you make your deal. WCWM, hello. Oh, hi. Yes, sir. Speaking. Oh. Yeah. Oh. WCWM, hello. Hey. Yes, sir. Oh, hi. I didn't think I gave you some quick. I didn't write you down. How you doing, man? Pretty good, man. Um, dude. I'll write you down. All right. The miracle of modern science. Oh, what a show. And the price is right. Let me say it again. The price is right. Everybody is everybody in South Florida sitting around our radio. You know, dealing with that radio dial. Dittle with each other. Let's name this show. I don't care what arbitrons says. I don't care what Bill Tanner says. That's silly, lady. I don't care what else she's screaming. Oh, the Spanish language stations. We're not getting enough credit. Yeah, right. Yamama. That's my comment to you. Yamama. Miss Tanner. See that that's a mistake is Miss Tanner right there. Right off the bat. That's our first mistake. But keep in mind it is the pepper Tanner building. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Look at that. We got 177 delegates in Florida. 165 up for grams today of which carry will get what 450. Something like that. Why are they wasting their time with this? In fact, it's a good idea. And I know not too many people have voted for it because the die is already cast. But for practice, right? Yeah. I know touchscreen machines go out there and touch it a little bit. Why do you still can't? How does this machine wait? Go out there and play a little bit of a hand. You also can do some practicing for November when a lot of you are going to be voting 3, 4, 5 times. What these old codgers, these old codgers that are running the polling places, on doing a little bait and switch bring your bag of disguises stuff like that. If you think I don't run the ATM, all of these things. 12 minutes past noon at 5, 60. Q and we got the marlins and the meds coming and all I can say is, thank God. You're like a new y'all. This is for 20, 50. You way out. Push, hate, Steve. Push, hate, Steve. Your feet, how upass? A gay amendment down. The love depends, for the go to become on their read home. Or more, we discussed it unless you're a head to Rokus. Push, hate, Steve. They say our love is taboo. They're what we're doing is wrong. But I don't care what they say. Because my love is so strong. They tell us we should be ashamed. We're not husband and wife. But I cherish each moment with you. I'm so glad you're in my life. You're my prison bitch. My prison bitch. You're not like a man. I'm glad we share a prison cell. When lights go past etching. I can't accept who I feel. Now that would be a crime. As long as I am doing you, I don't mind doing time. Calls you a buy. Prison bitch. My prison bitch. And I have no regrets. I got you for a candy bar. And a pack of cigarettes. At first you were a resistance. But now you're all my friends. I knew that I would get you in the end. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. I guess that you were sitting from above above. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. And now you're all my prison. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm a prison bitch. You're prison bitch. And you're a sex machine. Oh, oh, oh. I only have a one request. How about some of the police? Sure. I'm tired of this prison cell. I'm here to get away. The sentence leads you seven years. Not seven times a day. I'm not prison bitch. You're in for all my life. Are you sure? I really hate these markers. That the character of my back. I thought that I could break away. But now I'm losing hope. God, I'm tired of pain and I'm lost so. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. I've heard of the lights cause I can hardly wait. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. I'll never get out. I'm ready. You go straight. Prison bitch. I'll never say goodbye. You're not alive over your others. Too bad they had to die. On the second thought I'd be about to die. If you want me to. You're prison bitch. Prison bitch. Prison bitch. You're living. You're living. Is never leaving. Yeah. Yeah. I personally would not sell me. But now you're my full man. Some forever. I'm not alive. No, I'm not alive. Yeah, I'm not alive. I'm not alive. Are you hurting her? No. You're not alive when you call her, nish. No. Oh. Who. Who. I like that. Do it again. 21 past noon at 5.60. WQ and the land of the used to be free and used to be brave and used to have all kinds of freedoms not no more. No more freedoms baby. But the good news is DC Stapford killer my helmet sentenced to death. What do I call that? John Allen my hand was sentenced to death. I told him he snipe her shootings that terrorized the Washington area. Circuit Judge Lee Roy Mulled you and you turned aside a plea from my Hamid's attorneys to spare their clients life. He ordered my Hamid executed October 14 but that date likely would be postponed to allow appeals. See that's what bugs me all these appeals on and on. Just like Bundy. How many years did they appeal at that thing? About 30 minutes. What's currently fried his nasty ass? God. My Hamid denied any. This is the best part. He denied any of the involvement in the killing students they tell him the judge. Don't make a fool of the constitution of the United States of America. Just like I said in the beginning I had nothing to do with this and I'll say it again. I had nothing to do with this. Right. Right. Say it again. I know that it would okay. Keep saying it. Are you sure? Here's the facts from Mike who's obviously been hanging out under the bed too long and I don't blame him for being a little bit obscured. He says I've got a bunch of websites. I can't find John Kerry's middle name. Could we have another JFK? Is this name Francis? Fredo. Seriously, this is his name Francis? No. Well, he is JFK. We do know that. But I had he says do we have another JFK? No. The initials are JFK, but do we have another JFK? No. No, chain. I've been closed. I don't want to pee on his parade, but you know he ain't no JFK. California lawmakers proposed lowering the 40 year vote against the 14. All right. What a joke. But you made a good point for the show when I talked about the story and that is that the kids they like Arnold big time. So he could have like 90% of the vote next time. And of course, we'll pass that amendment in Congress and make him eligible to run for president. We can have eight years of Arnold as president. Minions of California teenagers and the combinations first to vote under a proposed constitutional amendment introduced yesterday by a 71 year old state senator. Senator John Vascon Cello, Stemocratic Santa Clara, proposed the idea alongside three other lawmakers, same the internet, cell phones, multi-channel TV and a diverse society make today's teams better informed than generations of their predecessors. Right. So I guess they can figure out if they're going to vote for Arnold and Pornosaise, right? I'll do it. Behind the beaded. The rope. Coming on the heels of an expected record load turnout among adults in the March second election, Vascon Cello's would give 16 year olds March second election. What does that mean? Isn't today March 9 last time I checked? Yeah. Oh, I see on the heels of what last week. Vascon Cello's would give 16 year olds a half of vote and 14 year olds a quarter of a vote to state elections beginning in 2006. Got that? Got that? If you're 16, you're going to half of vote. If you're 14 to quarter of vote and if you're 50, I guess you get like, what's between a quarter and a half, three eights? Okay. Yeah. Two thirds. The idea formally called training wheels for citizenship first requires two thirds of approval. See there you go. By the legislature to appear on this November's ballot. California's suggestion comes 33 years after the West Lord is voting age from 21 to 18. A minute, fledgling youth will be in the US and other nations to lower the voting age. Supportors say, is we'll allow 17 year olds to vote local elections, while Austria and Germany last 16 year olds to vote in some local elections. A bill in California led 17 year olds vote in primary elections when they will be 18 year olds from general election is languished. People who are given opportunity when accounts often live up to its advanced concelles, fight by nearly 14 years from across the state. Right. A Republican colleague called it, the another side they have ever heard. Set a sentiment, ray hands Republican and we were at it. There's a good reason why 14 and 16 year olds don't vote. They're not adults. They're not mature enough and here comes my favorite line of the whole year. They're easily deceived by political shardohin. Well, not like the adults. But I still say it's a stupid idea. Okay. Just put the crap. That's like 10 year olds. What do you say? We give them a tentative of vote and then we get to be 12 again. Like a eight tenths. Right. Zyne America. Baby, that's all I can tell you. It's insanity. Mass madness. Lunacy. This is your Congress hard at work. This is the state legislators hard at working California. Is if they don't have bigger fish to fry? 26 past noon at five 60 WM. How's your new year's resolution going? It's already the ninth of March. Like I said, only moments ago and you're still fat?

I asked him for a pint of fortune, be me just knowing the end of what does that mean? But the butter's too English, I'm gonna mow. Got the corner deline. Hell, I think I've been Pakistan's kicking with smelly. Or you can go back to the lower end. I came here, we're making years ago, we've learned my ABC.

Here, Mr. Roger, this letter is to let you know, this is the final straw I heard your show is many time, and it becomes apparent you develop your on-air persona into something that seems very angry and negative toward the neighborhood, you abroad cash too. Back in the days you've seen more personable, it was upbeat then, with topics and local updates of speed trap. Everyone was happy and we have good times, maybe you bring back your old birdman or lightning round. We was happy and made me smile like a child. Stop relying on right wings that are out, this is a past that won't return. Stock George from talking, this seems to upset you. Without changes, I won't listen long time listener, also misspelled like everything else in his time to rose. Castle-Holys rose. Yeah, have a good one for us. Wow. Actually that was from Mike and Boka, Mike El Gallant Gifts. Yeah. Phone number. Got the facts number. It's just a joke, Mike. Go be sent in this no more funny crank of facts is okay, with all kinds of misspellings. We got the Marlins and Amets exhibition baseball any interest. Oh, they don't care, 1255, it's coming with your lecher or not, so be prepared, put your hand right on that knob now. Be prepared to twist it fast. Who should join carry pick for his run-inmate that's our pull question of 8, 731 votes not too bad? John Edwards 254, Bob Graham 127, that's exactly a double isn't it? Last time I checked. Okay. Like I said, Edward 255, Graham 128, Bill Clinton 123, I don't care on for Bush 67, 9.1% pretty Wake, pretty Paul Pree, Bushmeister, I don't care period 40, Hillary 37, General Wesley Clark 32, Dick K. 22, Bill Richardson 14, Tom Broko 11 and poor Bill, not so still sucking when they're in last place. He's only got six, man. That is pretty weak, he's got six out of 700 and some odd. WQAM hello. WQAM hello. Hey, damn I. WQAM hello. Hello, Jill, I'm a black man who pissed off to fire the night. Alright, get some George Floyd. Yeah. That's it. I guess I was it. I was just waiting for maybe like a little quick follow up. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, come on, you only got about 15 minutes to go here to ball game. Tell me, I know you folks can do it, man. Come up with a great A-Stuff. Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. WQAM hello. Hello, how you doing? Okay, sir. Hey, I just put my ears on. So you might have already gone over this, but I heard from some very inside sources in the FCC that them finds are going to be suspended till after the election. How is that possible? Well, I heard the 12 finds you were talking about that would be put out the week. Coming down this week, right. Right. I'm not going to be coming down until after the election because they don't want anybody looking like a murder. I listen to the search show on home this morning. Yeah. And that's what he started to show with that he's got to. Very good inside sources inside the FCC. Yeah. And, you know, they don't want the people to find in the course on the outside bush. You know, looking like murder. Well, I think I knew. And that's great. Yeah, you know, I figured you want to hear that. That's the only reason I've heard all the more reason to kick bush out in November, I hear it, Iceland. Oh, I'm going to book that now, but no bush in my White House and no bush in my women. I'm happy to see you. Come back. 560, 50560. 560, 80 and 10 Verizon. Well, we didn't do that test this morning. Let's do that tomorrow. Okay. Well, Joe, is an ostrich that we have to do that. All right. I keep telling stuff about that and he's like, Well, I like that. Of course, Clarence, he's busy with sports with ball games, you know. With all kinds of odd shaped balls. So that would be interesting. Good news if that happens to be true. That's going to, but I don't know. I'm a little bit dubious about that. Because Howard seems to be singing a different tune every day now. The last Friday was going to be maybe his last day on the air and his days are numbered. And the kids, Corey told you the finds are coming on this week. So what he said. And now evidently, at least according to this last caller, finds maybe he'll be off until after the election. That would be too obvious. What a day. Oh, WQM, hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? One time, listen, I really like bush a lot though. I'm a bush man. Yeah. Yes, yeah. And that's it. Somebody QM, hello. Hey, how you doing, sir? Okay. Can I make a request, please? Maybe. It's real short. I'm Friday. George played the weapon of Jesus with a Howard Dean drop.

Whatever that may be. They probably have been loud in the can already. And if they don't watch out, it could be something that we can have to see. Now they just got some tall skinny guy at the, the, the hasn't been shaving pretty much lately. They'll whip him out. Good luck. Good. Good day. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6.

I'm calling you. Okay. I'm just a Jackson there and see what the spin brings around. Okay. We'll see what it brings around. Okay. I think maybe you're. Yeah. Wow. Jesse Jackson. He running? No. Woo.

Yeah. I think they have all the problems. That'll take care of all the problems that are watching the DCM. Yeah. And not everywhere. All over the world. Right. Okay. Good luck to you, my man. George has got some really good crap for you. If you come by the station about one o'clock. Oh, I don't. Yeah, you do. I'm looking for it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 60. What happened to the good deals used to make out their right next to the, uh, Chuck's on the corner. They're 4, 41, 9, as Dury Road. How do they know what you're talking about?

You're phone keeps recycle every two minutes. I, uh, hangs up. I'm going to keep going back. I don't know. Okay. Keep you busy. Keep your hands busy, man. All right. Anyway. I want to call you. I just something about with all the censorship going on. I mean, I, I, I, I wish you every day, but I've usually only half the day because I'm a driver. So I'm, I'm out of this. I'm out of the vehicle. Right. So, um, John, now, what is it? Is there anything coming down on you? You got a referendum or something or anything? No. No. Well, I love what we have not a letter, but we have a statement of policy by the company. And we have to watch our peace and cues, man. We have to be a, because the FCC has just changed the whole volume. No. They just changed all the rules in the middle of the game. Things that we've been able to do for 20, 30 years. Not no more. I realize that. Yeah. And, you know, a lot of your program is excellent. Uh, uh, entertainment. Yeah. But, um, I just, you know, I just don't want it to, uh, feed away because, uh, you know, they, they, you know, they don't, they're not going to allow you to do all your little sketch and all that. They're not going to allow us to do all our little sketch. But we'll do a different little sketch. You know what I'm saying? All right. Well, we have to think of another form. There you go. Good luck to us, pal. What was he trying to say? Little sketch. I see. By the way, speaking of that on this side of the border, meaning the side I'm on right now advocates of the same sex rights are calling it a brain drain. Or that's on the US side. While their counterparts in Canada are boasting of a gay game. You got that? Pardon? Since Canada's immigration law was changed in 2002 to recognize same sex partners for immigration purposes. And ever growing number of gay and lesbian couples have uprooted and migrated, especially couples, in which one partner is the US citizen and one is not. Most heterosexual foreigners in long term relationships with Americans can immigrate legally and stay with their loved ones by marrying, but gay couples don't have that option. The same sex wedding of being performed San Francisco do them no good, because immigration is a federal concern and the federal government doesn't of course recognize gay marriages. So as gay and lesbian couples from around the world flock to San Francisco to marry, people such as Abby Summer cast their eyes north. The 47-year-old San Francisco resident is making plans to move to Canada with her girlfriend to six years. She's a Russian-in-this-country-in-a-student visa. For us folks playing to take off the Canada and nothing's really changed. We still have to go and sit summer. A business development manager at a software company. No one should have to go through this. This country is like going back in time. It's a bunch of Puritan she says. I don't want to sound really bitter, but I am. How well said, this country is like going back in time. It's a bunch of freaking Puritan. I don't want to sound bitter she says, but I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. Hey. It's Howard. Howard Spam. Oh, right. That's all for Neil today. The barlands have to play. I'm sure Neil doesn't find going home. I'm going home. Now do wardleys, mort holes. And here it's EAT that blows. And the rest of us with five. Turn off the wheel. It's far less than strong. It's far less than strong. It's boring and it's a big barland face. It's small. And such a goddamn pity. Because I'm for those who don't like to think. And yet excitement from re-cock the same. It's far less than strong. Now I guess a f**k. Or get the enter caper. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. Or get the enter caper. The barlands want their payment. Attracture will be green and must be dead. First, despite the ratings, they have to pay the bid. And hopefully, they're tied in an audience. So brains are dead. It's hard to pay. It's small. It's time to make a sandwich. It's hard to pay. Small. I'd rather hear your men. Exciting as the sound of driving a tune. Design for those with trouble. Any lane. It's hard to pay. It's called. Life is as old as mud. I'm spot-of when in the road. It's a 50- плат and an ambitious part of the day. It's called. No one gives a f*****. It's called the third-maid line. It's a very good one. Take the line of third-maid. And then sing it on a hearty beat to me. Great. It's a nice bleach in there though.
