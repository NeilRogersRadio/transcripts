Head of the Master is a professional writing program at the University of Southern California, where Selby taught us an adjunct professor for the past 20 years. There was that generation of writers, William Gross Henry Miller, and then there was Hubert Selby, and he's one of the life of that generation, some of the greatest writers in this country. Susence Selby said her late husband was kind and generous, but a recent year suffered from depression and occasionally would launch into races.

And his wife said that while he had a badminton, and much of his work dealt with the topic, he always wrote while sober-headed and a booze of drugs since 1969. A lot of his wife survived about four children, a loving grandchildren, he's dead. Hubert's sub-age on your reclum per dream. He's dead, you get it? I got it. Okay. Who was he? A guy. Anyway, who got on the beaded curtain today? Well, actually, we have a bonus for it. We got a two-for-one like, yeah, how do you like that? Maybe three-for-one, depending on what you're counting. We got Emon. Emon. Which I never heard of her before? I'm happy to lie. So Emon, oh, he's what I'm on. I mean, what a lady. You didn't see her at Oprah? No, I don't watch Oprah. Thank goodness. I'm very proud of what I would say, do not watch Oprah. No real man watches Oprah. And I don't either. Contrary to the prolific universal belief that she was a wild-entain beauty that's spoken on low language, and was discovered hurting goats to the Somalian wealth. The origins of celebrity for Magnum Supermodel because Medix Antipenure Emon, our Blanket comparison, the facts, the simple truth is that Emon was a university of Nairobi, co-ed, working her way to her degree in political science, when World of Noun glamped the toggle her petrified. Spotted her walking across the campus. He said, would he like to be my beard? Not exactly herding goats, but pushing a bicycle instead. We call Emon, why this goes on? This is a biography that goes on forever. It goes on. After 16 years of laboring me for the Camelinses as a model in walking hundreds of glamorous miles of top-through runway Emon said, Enoff, in 1989, traded in the Hall of Beloe of New York for the Hush quite of L.A. to pursue a career on the silver screen. While in Hollywood, Emon, one of the number significant parts in movies and TV shows including Out of Africa, Star Trek, no way out an exit to Eden. Shacting seemed so natural to me, since fact is every ounce is theatrical exacting, she said. Oh, let's see, she, uh, Mava Beat, but I hope I'm going to say anything about David Bowian here. I don't know. Oh, it does. After taking a minute to step off the movie, set Mary Super Rockery David Bowie Emon again, set her sights on Manhattan, the next we incarnation the founding of our own cosmetic company designed exclusively for women of the of color and he panomously named Emon. So there you go, she's got her own branded cosmetics for slightly dark way she ain't too dark, she's a fairly light-to-past. Little darker than Michael Jackson, kind of somewhere in between Michael Jackson and Troy Strattford, I would say. Well, she doesn't have a little bit of ego like Michael does. I see. Uh, speaking of Troy Strattford came in a distant third in the celebrity charity race, the miniature horse race in Paparot Park last night, a distant third out of a field of three. Oh, right. Former New York Jets kicker Don Silvestri was the winner. Woody Bennett was second former adult and running back briefly, and Troy Strattford was distant third way down the stretch. It was estimated to have finished third by 20 lengths. At least I was close to the axe most of the race Woody Bennett said, look, as if Troy Strattford didn't have the hands, as he was having trouble keeping his horse on trot most of the way. Hey, I tried Stratford said that I had such a winning career with the dolphins. I don't want these guys to be crying again if I beat them in the race. Nice going Troy for you, kid. The hands of brick. Kind of like some of the guys at Paparot Park. I don't want to mottonope mention no names. They've in Graham, but anyway. Let's see. Let's take a look at the pull from Mr. and we've got that Howard Stern story. Wait till Thursday, man, if these numbers from San Diego or an indication of what's going to be happening in the key channel markets where a Stern got dumped in those six markets, including Miami? Oh boy. Oh my god. It is going to be like you. I'm kipper for Big One06 on Thursday. Did you hear that number? I read to Miss Muff about San Diego in the morning show? No. You didn't hear that though? It's busy dealing with the lemas. Oh, forget about it. Oh, it's speaking to that. Guess who's into Rhonda right now? River. No. Same the sounds just the same as what you just said. Let me give you a little clue. Louis Armstrong. Hello, Dolly. Sorry. Lama. Dolly Lama's here. Oh yeah. You're going to go see. Dolly Lama. In fact, I've seen many of these geckys running around and they're purple all the Buddhist denouner kind of reddish purple whatever the color is. Then I'll fit they were. What do you call that thing? A smother. That purple smother they were the Buddhists. So anyway, Dolly Lama is here. And of course, I'm wondering, what is anybody care? What is that all about? Dolly Lama. What is anybody care about? To bet? No. I mean, we got some people on the station who like to bet, but that's another story. Anyway, so Dolly Lama is here. If anybody wants to see him come by saying hi, Dolly. Hey, hello, Dolly. Hey, silly old man. Anyway. Let's take a look at the results. Today's pool before we talk about the rating stuff. All these things got a heavy duty. Play we got today's pool. About kind of gives me the heat bee jeepies when I think about it. Yesterday's pool. The worst TV show of all time. I guess I better print this sucker out. Shouldn't I? Because there's a long list here. And I do want to read each and every one. Watching that's a really good idea. Do you ask me why? I said twice then we can go home. Oh, okay. Oh, no, it's a long and prestigious list. We have a little technical problem. I hope it's not involving the rest of our audience and only in the building there. You know the building where they didn't bother getting me paid on time yesterday. I just mentioned that again in passing a county lady. The same county lady who was playing butch boss about oh, we can't spend $50 to send a couple of toothbrushes up there to Neon Toronto. It just toothbrushes. Let him brushes teeth with his finger. Yeah, exactly. But then on the other hand, what comes my check to yesterday the 26th no less. Did it show up in a mail? No. So once again, there's poor mismuffering around doing everybody else's job, which is okay because you know we have one of his underdo anyhow. There he was running around taking care of business for the county lady. Whatever I don't even want to get into it. With that more county lady since I've been there. But third man every few weeks because generally they they're like the waitresses at the old wolfies, you know. They rip off the apron they scream out of their places and that house in the they leave. Which is generally how the accounting people at QAM do too because the beeslees don't like paying their bills. Sorry, the worst TV show of all time is the Rick Sanchez show Rick they hate you like poison man. In fact, isn't he on right now? 10 to 11 and a half. Flip on channel six there. What whatever it is on the cable. That cable is so screwed up. There's Rick Sanchez. How do you have a little bit? There's one thing I learned from. Yes, one thing I learned. Don't trick and drive man's not a good idea. Especially in part of the stadium when it's real crowded. Anyway, the Rick Sanchez show the worst TV show of all time 294 which I guarantee is triple you ought to in swash in a right now. And in the coal show 205 not even close to Ricky Tiki Sanchez. Dr. Phil 154 a very respectable third. The 700 club with a grining drooling pet Robertson 133 magic Johnson Chachow had 102. Survivor 91 Rosio Donald show 82.

The jury Reynolds show sneak dinner with 14. I didn't even know that the Josh actually put him on there yesterday. I thought he kind of liked less than off. But there he is. I am that hemorrhate 14. I would have pretty much variety out which I think there's a lot of similarity there. The gong show in fear factor we've had 13 and Johnny loves Chachy a dozen. Mama's family 10 to 18 nine trials and charge eight around the Horn eight loss in space eight and it's just as Zidian. Now we know these holy mole and realize we had so many shows on here.

Mike Douglas show named that tune and you bet your life out of almost 17 or the vote. They didn't get any. So that's a good sign I guess or them although quite frankly. But you bet your life.

As if you're really choosy right? Any kind of waste 350 is juicy. In fact he might be qualified for the poll today him in the beast matter fact. Today's poll which of these people fits the description to Jewish tomorrow we'll do which. What are we doing tomorrow to Cuban okay to black to Italian and to gay. Those are the if I can't go is that I came up with. Huh? Right. In fact this one may not that I don't know we want to do the whole four hours. Although I guess we better because with all the technical problems that we're hearing there with the internet connection. For some strange reason to QAM studios can't connect with Eric and he can't connect with them. They can't get on a website and whatever we just can't get on a way. We can go everywhere else though. Evidently I have no problem here everything looks just fine to me and evidently some other people are Houghton too because we got the whole Schmidt load of votes came on a PSN there on the TV shows. So for a change it strictly a QAM problem how unusual huh? I could play Bellevue Brian but that would probably be in very poor taste. I hate this play and says nothing works here. That would be cruel and insensitive and another shout out engineering and at the whole beastly operation which is like So it would be there fault and probably is not. Well let's blame him anyways especially since I get my check yesterday because that accounting bitch that won't Me the give my toothbrushes. Well guess what I'm getting him anyway how do you like that honey? Whether without your help. I'm ingreaded it's not a big deal. I mean I got plenty of toothbrushes but just not those radius ones. There's a product like I said if anybody wants me to do spots for a product course you only Problem is you got to find a place to buy it. Well why do you think that is? So is there like some kind of a monopoly going on toothbrushes? Oh and I got another piece of news for us being toothbrushes? Is that you know the oral B toothbrushes? I would in fact I've got one which I'm never going to use again. It's got the little switch on to like the little electric motor in there. Yeah yeah. And it well guess what those things do? Wow. Did you have mercury fillings? Listen to me. Yeah. Oh mercury fillings. It loosens up the vapors from the mercury in your mouth and releases them in your system. See when you go and have your teeth clean by you know you're high-genist at the dentist's Orifice they do it like very quickly and they like wash it all out and they only Put a little poison into your system. But when you're brushing with that every day like with crushed pressure. It's releasing all the mercury so unless you don't have any mercury fillings in your mouth anymore I would not be using one of those again. It's just my suggestion. I know that there's some people really a fanatic about that whole thing about mercury fillings and the fact that it stays in your body a long, long time. In fact even past your when you're dead it's probably still like glowing and killing it. Right. Howard Stearns radio ratings up a mid-FCC flat. Oh did I get to the pool now? What's it these people? Best fits a description to Jewish. In other words when you see him her it you get the heby G.B. Very shandling. Friend, pressure, the nanny. I voted for her. She just I can't stand her. She's a walking at the same. In fact the ADL a lot of pro-prime at the reruns of that show from being shown. Jerry Seinfeld or Jackie Mason that was our shirtless before. To what you can add. Sure that they're. Huh? Joe Lieberman. I added that so that I could go. Oh, Julie Lieberman telepathically. Oh, he's so. Yeah. Two Jewish and two wimpy. Oh, I think. I'd like. But he was there with the John Kerry though. They rate the Kerry. Why my heath nest wasted time. I got the Tom Olifant column from the Boston Globe about he was standing for feet behind through his medals or ribbons or whatever you want to call him. And he's got the real stir around that in the way that the trying to manipulate this. And boy, you talk about Hutspa. You got this eight wall president and Dick Tain you got five deferments. So we didn't have to go put his ass online if he had none. And they're not in Kerry for his military service. It's just it's pathetic. The fact that actually this sticks with some of the morons out there. Somebody morons out there. But you deal with a demelector. What can I tell you? If you weren't a Kerry B. 40 50 points in it already. What's this thing you just facts? Dear Georgia Neal. Here's how we might stabilize. I don't want you a lot. Stabilize Iraq. I don't want even look at that crap. Don't send me any more of that garbage. You can't want to do it like the old radio. Got all the way to have Zillions of really great articles here today. But I'll look at all those phone lines coming in there. But before we get to that, what we'll do one. WQM. Hey, can I have a toilet? Yes sir. Woody Allen. Woody Allen is too damn Jewish. Good band. Yeah. To also to neurotic. Well, that's part of the whole Jewish syndrome. He's a nebis. He's the poster. Nebis is the word. Nebis is the poster child for Nebis. Well, him and Julie women. That's a good battle. That's another pull for a future day. Keep in mind. Who of these is the biggest nebis of them all? Who do you think would win a slot fight? A friend, Russia. So there's Woody Allen for you. Which of these people fits a description just too Jewish? I get the he B. G. He's just thinking about him. WQM. Hello. How are you? Pretty good sir. I got one for your poll. Okay. If it cares my kiss kiss out to look at very, very manllow. Very manllow is just too Jewish and too, he probably began another pull too. Okay. Thanks. Good choice. Mandy. That's a lot of this is so kind of. Well, we can't say talk about that anymore. Can we know back in the day though? We could have probably made a quadruple on top of that one. Not anymore. Federal regulators may have painted a big bullseye and Howard Steer and asked, but through what that doesn't say that. Here's his back, but I think asked is more appropriate. But the recent government cracked on an indecency over their waves has proven a boon to the shop. Jocks ratings are a speaker of that. Isn't that amazing having I always told you that everything in life kind of like weaves together, right? Beacon a boon? The boon in the box, Erica is done in magnificent job of enlarging that thing. And obviously if you saw it early, you know, he needed some enlarging badly. So on our beaten curtain, not only do we have E-mon, but underneath E-mon. So to speak is a very large blow-up pad boon in the box. For everyone to see. I beg you pardon me, I saw a can, so that I just got through Santa. Because back in the day, he sure was a pretty young guy, but nevertheless. So there's goodly two shoes pad boon sticking his package to a cardboard box for all the sea. Maybe there were some toothbrushes in it. Anyway, the Ryebald radio host can back to Howard's sperm scored major gains in the list of ship during the winter quarter ended March 31st and the three biggest markets in New York, LA Chicago, according to figures released by Arbitron on Monday. We'll see what happens in the South Florida Thursday, 11.30 in a morning. In Stearns home market of New York, where he shows broadcast on K-Rock, he tapped all morning drive competition with a 7.2 share in total audience that's 12 plus a 7.2, which is staggering up 22% from the fall quarter and 18% from last winter. Let's see. Stearns show a head dip to number two in total audience last fall, but it's back big time number one. Thanks to 80 billion dollars with the pre-policity. Stearn also returned to number one during the first quarter among New York listeners, 18 to 34 and 25 to 54. Overall, it was his best show in the nation's top markets since the fall of 2000. In LA, where his carried on KLSX FM, Stearn Klein backed the number one in the key Democrat for 2554 for the first time since the summer of 95. He also rose from 6th place to 4th place in total drive time audience with a 4th two share and in Chicago, Stearn posted a 23% gain in morning drive, jumping from 15th place to number nine. So this, which one, it says, the latest round of fines after they were proposed issue to stay in calling the FCC's actions aim a Carthletop which on which he is correct. Stearn also accused of Republican dominated FCC assembly him out. Well, see, that's that's all. He made a martyr out of himself and it succeeded. Even though, but less sponge got canned, the guys in Atlanta, the regular guys they got canned, a man cow graphed fine, but again, it's all about how ordinary it worked. But this, this, this, this paragraph right here, this may be the most staggering piece of radio news in history until Thursday, at least. In San Diego, which was one of these 6 key channel markets at Dumpton. Let me see how my memory is. It was Miami, Rochester, Louisville, Orlando, Pittsburgh, and San Diego. What a memory for crap. In San Diego, one of the markets where it shows removed by clear channel radio station, KIOs, these FM's drive time ratings drop from an 8.9 share in February. This is in the monthlies 8.9 in February to a 0.7 in March, a 0.7 in the first month without Stern, Stern Sherman, syndicated in total for this station. And 8.9 to a 0.7 big one, oh six man, you are going to disappear on Thursday. Just going to vanish right off your radio dial. That's where everybody saw the big drop in that trend just after one week. You ain't seen nothing yet. That's a huge whole difference. 27 after 10 at 5 60 clear channels, the anti-Christmagnomus think about it just say to clear channel, Tom Humbler and Dred, like they say in Tabet.

Let me ask you this question Uh, is the Kentucky Derby this Saturday? Dye I'm pretty sure it is And I'm not doing any homework And I believe Friday we're going to get a call from Dave Johnson Which we do every year I don't want to be like Sit in my head Done Huh? Come with my pants down Especially when Dave Johnson calls you know how Jewish he is What year is it? There yeah And anyway so we better check that out I think the Derby is this Saturday If somebody will tell us somebody will fix it in Because I think it's the first Saturday and May And it and And Saturday is May first last time I checked Sports is propaganda The death of Pat Tillman This is by Randy Shaw This article is so good It's on our website I'm going to read it anyway Randy Shaw probably can direct As much as we like to think of big time sports As much as we like to think of big time sports is in a Escape from the real world There are times when it's politically conservative Messages must not be ignored That's why even non sports fans should be troubled by the Milletouristic jingle wasn't that accompanied Media coverage of former NFL star Pat Tillman's death There's denied while serving as an army ranger in Afghanistan Pat Tillman left the Arizona Cardinal football team And May 2002 to join the military as an army ranger It was certainly not newsworthy that somebody Running big money is a pro athlete would give it up to join the military But left unspoken in the sports media's ample coverage of Tillman Is the recognition that most Americans dying overseas Join the military for economic reasons Even the media that supported the war as a fight for freedom Find it amazing that anyone would actually sacrifice money to join the war fair In the sports world there was not a hit of ambiguity As to the merits of the cause in which Tillman lost his life NFL commissioner Paul Taglia boo stated that like other Protecting our freedom around the world Pat made the ultimate sacrifice After Taglia boo made a statement of the star The Saturdays NFL draft the crowd repeatedly chanted USA USA ESPN's NFL English Marks Square That's stated that Tillman made the ultimate sacrifice So that the people of the country could be protected ESPN's Friday night sports and it was all over the Tillman's story Company pictures of Tillman with waving American flags ESPN's website was similarly focused on Tillman And it's NFL andeless Marks Square that's stated that I just got through Readnet there was on a cardinals announced it would retire as number That applies to our surrounding their new state and will be named Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza At the same time that the sports world was mourning its tribute to Tillman Bush campaign operatives in their media allies Requesting Senator John Kerry's military service during Vietnam Suddenly Kerry's willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice and Diapers' country was no longer a sign of the great moral leadership And media associated with Tillman And Kerry's case the GOP got the media to raise questions about the nature of Kerry's war wounds And whether all three of his purple hearts were deserved Of course George W. Bush never made the ultimate sacrifice or risking his life for his country But Bush once owned the Texas Rangers baseball team and claimed to like NASCAR And is regularly praised by sportscasters and writers for being a real sports fan And hence a regular guy Kerry Edwards and other social critics of sport have argued that it was no accident That pro football's popularity rose along with the fighting in Vietnam The reason football's not been taken up by other countries is that it's militarism He's throwing a bomb to the scrab along pass and inherent violence does not strike a chord The NFL regularly acts as propaganda for the West military Any professional athlete questioning whether American troops overseas are really protecting Marcus freedom or are instead of vehicle for US imperialism What had their endorsements yet in career shortened The NFL in America's military industrial establishment both read billions from the actions of young African American men Many who menned up broke manned or both Just as the American publics been shielded from seeing the caskets of those killed in Iraq Sports fans rarely see profiles of the beaten down X NFL players Who's post-wear lives mean pain hardship and a much shortened life expectancy Nearly in all NFL owners are Republicans and some like Alex Spannels of the San Diego Chargers are large donors to the GOP And conservative causes NFL owners let's get the benefit of taxpayer supported stadiums the guaranteed profit And the ability to use the seemingly apalot area of pro football to spread their political gospel Detensive millions of voters Now that progressive is finally gotten it together to create a talk radio network The next challenge is to further infiltrate the world of professional sports Hey, Konaa, but on this station I'll tell you that except the juke crew we got Huh? Because in a one hand you got Joe Rose who's about as apolitical as anybody I can think of it on the other hand You got the mad dog who's contributing money to Bob Graham's campaign But every day when he gets the chances of looking George Bush's push If you don't understand every single day Do you have the speech you have their huh? I haven't noticed that well I have what you don't listen that's your problem You're probably No problem at all Ha ha ha No that's our problem because if you get a dire, you're going to probably put down the NPR or something like that And stick it to us Yeah right which of these people of beat what is beat the lists? Why can't I look a little bit more here now? After we'd met after they had that same paragraph and there twice the same story That wasn't my doing it was in the story and I saw an Eric is probably the original story Which of these people best friends in the description of being too Jewish gives you the hevy jibis when you be seen them Jackie Mason 52 friend ranger 47 julee roman 33 we got a dobbatterler for first Gary shandling 10 Woody Allen 7 Jerry sign filled five very manalotry Sanity of his junior two Allen green spans got a pair David Schwimmer's got one spell wrong I love her where we spell that a squimmer I wrote winder been one in barba wall wall.

recovery And I've heard it to the war in Iraq that you're insisting you're not planning In bush world you know consult your father the expert in being president during a war with Iraq But you do talk to your higher father who can't talk back to you to warn you to get an exit strategy or try You for using him for political purposes In bush world is all right to run for re-electness the Avenger of

It's coming down. It's like the statue there in Iraq and that photo off remember that yeah That photo off the statues coming down here we go Boy, I'm gonna tell you the way they manipulated the public here. You got a head into a man Hitler would be so proud Here, my'm Gary Joseph. I suppose it would be proud and jealous because they didn't have TV to use back in the back in the day And of course the other way you look at it. There could be exposed for all allies and Vs and the DC except for the fact that they got these people Just like Don Carole on ahead all those judges in his pocket didn't share while the same thing with the bush Myster and all these right with these neocons they got the media in their pocket That's that liberal media That we keep here in so much about Eric Alderman the myth of the liberal media That's a book you should read along with all these others. There's so many Anyway Thomas Olifand who's a great writer and cartoonist I must Carry through his war decorations. This is in today's a Boston globe On the way to the fence where he threw some of his military decorations 33 years ago I was four feet five feet behind John Kerry as he near the spot from which members of Vietnam veterans against the war were We're partying with a few of the trappings of their difficult past to help them face the future more squarely I watched Kray reach with his right hand to the breast pocket of his fatigue shirt The hand emerged with several of the ribbons that most of the vets have been wearing that unique week of protest Much as they are worn on a uniform blouse There couldn't have been all that many decorations in his hand six or seven because he made a closed fist around his collection with ease As he waited his turn I recall him getting stopped by one or two wounded vets in wheelchairs Clearly worried that they wouldn't be able to get their stuff over the looming fence We have him a few more decorations. Kerry says he doesn't remember this It is true that Kray was one of the veterans group leaders, but in this eclectic aggressively Individualist a collection of people who have been through a pointless war that were no privileges of rank Kerry was in the middle of a line perhaps of a thousand guys only a third or even less of the total would assembled on the Washington mall that astonishing week At the spot where the men were symbolically letting go of their participation in the war the authorities had erected a wood and wire fence to prevent it Then from getting close to the front of the US Capitol and carried paused for several seconds We had been talking for days about the war politics the veterans demonstration But I could tell Kerry was upset to the point of anguish and I decided to leave him be his head was down as he approached the fence quietly In a voice I doubt I would have heard had a not been so close to him. Kerry said as I vividly recall There is no violent reason for this. I'm doing this for peace and justice and I try to help this country wake up once and for all With that he didn't really throw his hand full toward the statue of John Marshall America's first chief justice In order to drop the decorations he sort of loved them and just walked out the stage Some people have written second hand accounts of that day stating that Kerry at the moment also through males have been given to him by a couple of vets of wood there I remember Kerry doing late that later in the day after the event had broken up He was in the company for a part of that time of a small group of gold star mothers would loss sons in the war In addition to the events involving the military decorations of veterans also held a pre-plating ceremony near the Capitol and Attended congressional hearings on civilian casualties of the conflict from what I could observe first had about Friday April 23rd 1971 Kerry did not make even the slightest effort to pretend that he was throwing all of his military to their military Decorations over the fence. He did what he didn't claim view in my case the view of someone close enough to kick him in the shins It was clear to me that Kerry had arrived here only with the ribbons he wore on his shirt Which by the way will refer to as medals by the late Stuart Sommington of Missouri one of the Center for Relations Committee members present for for his famous anti-war statement While the idea of turning back decorations had been talked about prior to that week There was no clear plan on when the veterans arrived Then I before the men had a long loud argument about whether to throw their stuff or simply place it on a long table and from the Capitol I watched Kerry argue for the lestermatic approach and lose It was clear from our conversations back then and ever since the Kerry made no distinction among his various decorations the others have Some in the military don't either I remember once asking my father who was awarded a bronze star on the Pacific during WW2 What he called the ribbon and lapel ornament he received an addition to the star he said they were all the bronze star I've always found the political juncture of the by Kerry's detractors to be undignified as well as largely inaccurate I right now because the political junk is much higher profile now though no less misleading and not by the way Because her fourth job in the public arena. I thought I'd just do and Kerry's staff I just happen to be there that long ago day I saw what happened here to heard what Kerry said and nobody meant the truth happens to be with him writes Thomas all of a sudden today's Boston globe and the idea that anybody should be excoriated for Exposing the military test career to get now more for having the courage to come back and Tell the American public that there was a bunch of crap and people were dying for nothing Shame on anybody would do that especially Draftoggers like Bush and Cheney and the other knee who comes in ever served one day in a military But I just mentioned that in passing Excuse me for getting I read No, no, what makes me so furious isn't the fact that they're doing it is the fact that they're actually people including these jackholes and immediate for buying into it Well, this is this makes sense. Well, it's a examiners. I mean there's a validity to listen He's some kind of take on my god coming to comey pinko Jane Fada jombed my stuff In echo out with knickers already with Pat Boons white bucks. Let's speak in a pad boom in the box Yeah, and we're here's the pool.

It says otherwise What mean that a sweet kid's been violated the most sickening way But Jackson is just committed a legal harry carry by far-ring lawyer as Mark Irrigos and Ben Bronfen Jackson fumes his decision to retain his new lawyer Tom Messero which his decision to loan That's almost as credible as OJ Simpson's innocent plea From what I hear counselor Messero is a very fine attorney said brep and who is still under a gag order Messero's especially celebrating the liberal and black community in California But Jackson so-called decision-making is as confused as Adam and Eve on mother's day This is by Steve Dumbly in the post a source posted his whole satin potentially shocking mess said Jackson bizarre Yes, but that shouldn't qualify him for being crazy because when he didn't firing those too hot Or as was legally psychologically and strategically crazy Now the truth the real person who called in messero is Michael's brother Randy Jackson Weston had much to do since the Jackson five. I don't even think I ever heard of him. Did you sure you did? Yeah, he was also gummo marks Emma Randy Johnson Anyway Randy Jackson is present kickers with the nation of Islam did I tell you that yesterday? Yes Now Steve hardly be says I'm not saying that they're paying him because the nation of Islam is at a practice of not even paying attention But what kind of brownie points will Randy give him this group is that a plan words brownie points? Who's leader Lewis Ferrican is a stone dead racist? The nation of Islam wants to make this a racist issue for Michael Jackson is payler than a bottle of milk Sadly some jurors define themselves by race, but Randy Jackson should know something the jury pool and Santa Barbara County Were Jackson will face justice is as white as OJ South Central jurors were black So Randy allegiance to the nation of Islam could just put bro Michael away for a long time and lonely place Wake up and get a real job Right Steve done leaving today's New York post Randy Jackson my ass 560 50560 pound 560 on the 18 that told they they wanted to turn into a racial thing They want to play the race card again. You know works are good for OJ Sure, they got a whole deck The only problem being that it's gonna be like Steve Dumbly. He says probably in all white jury We're gonna be given the black power salute at the end of the one the virtue comes in how is that trial coming How's the girl to come in any erra ojson William Strauss the OJson William is case the day OJs and William So that sentiment of support for her brother and sister and they might be murderers Is that gonna sleep in her cross-examination? Who is really the victim here? Miss me think of the json William case and you just saw on our jury clock that they're out for about an hour Jason Williams defense team and jeers been out for an hour. They're still low-brain, okay? They're palpitating and deliberate well, let's you know right away as soon as we get the virtue We're gonna fry his ass when that'd be great.

How 32 years of facts that says, from a dark, complicated listener in North Miami, T.R. I personally know Ricky Williams if he has any issue that is with his with too many women. He has two kids. He's all a 25. They're guys very much not gay. How do you like that? Okay. Actually, I resent the fact that if you're introverted, articulate, intellectual and black people assume you are gay, I prefer to think of him as the anti-dion Sanders, micro-urban or felony or stereotypical, legal, and a lot of choice. Please fear up the issue Ricky has no problem with those who are gay, otherwise, they just haven't enough to be a member of that club. Well, that's good. I didn't think he was gay. I don't know. Do you think he's gay? Poo. Zach? No, he knows. He knows. That seems that with girls. I'm serious. This is the problem with this poll, which is why two hours is more than enough because people are going to start banding about names, just because somebody wants a rumor that, you know, Ricky Williams was this or Louis Oliver was that or stuff like that. Oh. Let's see, Collins president disappointed by Cheney. Westminster college's president city was so surprised and disappointed by Vice President Dick Cheney's attacks on John Kerry during a speech that he's inviting the Democrat to visit for a reply. Fletcher Lancon told his associated press to Cheney staff approached him last week about using Westminster as the backdrop for a major foreign policy address, nothing was said about making a stump speech. In a campus wide email after the speech Lancon said, I must admit that I was surprised and disappointed that Mr. Cheney chose to step off the high ground or resort to Kerry bashing for a large portion of his speech. Nicole Devon is a Cheney spokeswoman said it was unfortunate that the speech payments had surprised the Lancon because it was always intended as a campaign message event. It was a major foreign policy address and it's my understanding that the college was made aware of Senator Kerry's different views on foreign policy would be mentioned throughout she said. Standing in the campus gymnasium where Winston Churchill warned in 1946 of an iron curtain that setting across post-war Europe, Cheney sharply criticized Kerry's Senate votes on defense and intelligence legislation. Lancon who described himself as a split-ticket voter said he tends to be a bit on the conservative side because of his military background. He's a former administrator at West Point. I'm pretty independent Lancon said, I can't tell you I'm one or the other, I'm not. As a college president, I tell her, I mean someone who has all viewpoints represented on the campus fairly and equally. What a concept. Almost as fair and balances Fox News. Lancon said he was not expecting a speech-minus and he mentioned presidential politics to run election year but that the second half was all about politics and a political stump speech and in that respect it was disappointing and the email Lancon said that in the interest of balance in fairness and integrity, we will strongly encourage Senator Kerry to take advantage of this venue to make his views known as well. Kerry spokesman Bill Burton said the campaign has received Lancon's email, we'll consider a visit to Westminster which is located in the center of a presidential battleground state Missouri. Missouri, man. You ever been there? Really, especially in the heat of summer, it is Missouri. It would have been San Luis? No, kiddo. Don't. Don't. It is steamy, man. It is so humid.

To 14 year old Andrew Jones, Detective say it was initiation in the so-called gang. First he and 11 year old friend are accused of locking a 12 year old boy in a trailer. They then took his seven year old brother inside Jones trailer and forced him to touch a hot stove, then a live electrical cord. The brothers were then brought to a truck behind the home and forced to perform several sex acts on one another. Each time while a switchblade was held to their throat. Shelling her face with her door, Jones mother admitted she was home at the time but had no idea what was going on. A neighbor and friend couldn't believe it. It doesn't sound like what he would do. That just doesn't sound right to me comments. Doug Walker. Jones is now facing one kind of false imprisonment to council. Lutherless abuse battery to council aggravated assault. What kind of battery to council sexual battery? The second boy who's a suspect has not been charged. That part of the case is now the state for his office. Detective say if there are any other victims, they should call the Lake County Sheriff's office immediately. There's a recurring theme again. Yeah, fraternity man is to decide. That's right.

We still got nowhere to go. So it's great news. I mean that Zectas left to go through all of this gymnastics to try to pass stuff along on here and get it on the site. Lust gymnastics. So we only have to put like two 3000 names on there just to make up for this now in the last hour. Well that's a relief. When I was the problem do we know or we just most acoustic rather we got about it. Like you said that it'll correct itself eventually and so it did. Well that's good. Just like magic. That's right.

I think. But in a meantime big one oh six and maybe some of the other cheap channel stations are gonna take a big dump. You'll see The big one oh six thing because remember how I commented when the last trend came out in just in one week out of 12 they had taken this unbeatable leaveable drop and of course at that time before we knew the San Diego thing for the full book. Right. Well if they can drop from an 8.9 to a 0.7 in one month How would you like to be one of their salespeople? Oh my goodness. Wow. Oh my god. So our sales department is marginal as they are there to be kissing the ground and kissing our asses collectively. There were still bringing them some pretty damn decent numbers on a station. It's so well we got those great billboards. You know once it's said listen yeah here we is listen what does that mean listen pretty weak. Well we'll take it We'll take anything we can get from this cheap ass outfit. By the way honey pay days on the 10th of the 25th decent. What's your name? Who? Our accountant lady.

Noodle at the cost of our kids. That's what we should have called a Bob Noodle. We should have hooded his ass off the stage. Our last day when he came down and made that. When he said, we should have hooded him right off the stage. Wow. We've tried everything we know to make this station go and we just haven't been able to make a made maybe the packs and people have more success. Basically, it gets the whole staff over there to announce right across from the radio station that they've sold the station because we're much a losers and they could make any money off us. And at the time we got Rick and Sus Neil Rogers Phil Henry Randy Rose, we had an all star or maybe the best line up in America of any talk source station and they could make any money from it. And one of the reasons they could make any money, we said the fact there's sales department's stunk and we decided the fact that their management was too busy. I would have finger in their nose and maybe with a booze in the glass before our Rob Green. And anyway, the reason that they could make any money is because they didn't know they were asked from our elbow and they were too busy wasting their time. Guess what? With the hurt coins and the dolphins. Yeah, that no matter what, it kind of like follows us around, you know what? Air v single station, even though it was in the sports station, they wasted about 80% of their time out about 5% of their programming. That was a big problem with cost broadcasting. Who now of course they've gotten out of the real radio business and they're just a jubbox. Just crank the hits out when on the coast and party radio, it's your brother. Let me just say this to you Mike Disney, okay, and you're probably listening right now because who that would listen to the crap that you guys are putting on. Party.

That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney. Playing the same 10 Euro records that they've been playing for the last two years. They got, you know, the rude and more de-ruud and Jeffrey duo and more of our stuffy doing more de-ruud. And that's it. Play the same 10 records over and over again. They just don't get it. 27 after one at 560 W to Q m on a great Tuesday man. You can feel it. You can smell it, man. You can smell the blood from Thursday morning, can't you? Yeah.
