So can't the smoke smoke. So can't the smoke smoke. So can't the smoke smoke. They can jabby good. We got this stand break on a command given group of bodies that I'm going to be able to. Let me ask you something. How's Jack doing? We'll find out. We got to make sure that press conference comes up on a clock or a little bit after one. There are boats. And of course we make way for that because when it comes to QA and only the sports are big goes. We're just filler here. Just filler material. That's all we do. Just kill on some time. Chillin and kill him. Well, the reason I played that bit. I learned that I was going to be a little bit more important than ever. Oh my God. And the children are trying at younger younger ages. Well, you can tell from the, what's going on there at QAM. Obviously, it must be so strong. You're like this roaming from it because there are excess wood. Even Moe shaved his head. That's a true story for those who didn't hear Moe this morning. Am I right? Absolutely. There you go. Shamed a clean. And his head too. In honor of. Right. Anyway. More children are trying the younger younger ages in part two. You as officials are changing their drug policies. Are you a potheads out there? Huh? What? Talk to me? Yeah. Piles no longer the general weed of the 60s and may pose a greater threat than cocaine or even heroin because so many more people use it. By the way, I'm drug free two weeks today. No sugar, no cap, no ice cream, no candy bars, no nothing. No sugar two weeks. Take. I've blood sugar this morning. We're 78. I've lost, uh, what did nine pounds in the two weeks? I've got so down a little bit on that, but not because of meeting any craft. No crap. Which I'm pretty excited about that. Anyway, officials at the National Institutes of Health and at the White House are hoping to shift some of the focus and research and enforcement from hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin too. Though wicked weed. So all you weed people out there. You better watch it cause the foth police are going to come in the kick your hand. I guess we got a switch back to coat that, Josh. We better get with it because we only got three hours and then, well, see, the audience isn't going to believe this. How to childish and embarrassing this place. But Clarence Diro, who was a little child plan program director, I gave him a choice. Because he came and wanted to make sure that we didn't play any like drop-ins during the press conference. Because some people, uh, the ten hockey fans we got in South Florida, maybe remember a couple of years ago that exciting press conference in which BT, bowtie is at Bill Tory, a fire delivery voice. Right. You know, played some drop-ins there when he announced that he had to terminate Brian Marie and Terry Marie and I would've dropped in a few of those. Oh, right. He had some fun with it. But you don't have fun with Chuck. You don't mess with that cause it's too dang important that QAM. We take this deadly seriously released day-to. George, they'll take it seriously. I sure is hell. I find it, I don't know whether it's historically funny or embarrassing. And Josh, he can't take because he needs a job. Right? Well, what he found out is, what the final is. And QAM is this, Chuck? Yeah. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha. Alright. Excellent. It's all shackled day, I'm QAM. Let's just shack up together. Here's George's pulleys up. You know, I got so sidetracked with all that crap going on there. I never even had chance to do the bio on Port Cate Hudson. Who I give about a seven and a half on a scale of telling you to be honest. Yeah. I give her four feet. Yeah. That's the kind of pictures that George selects to put on there when I'm on during these summer months because, you know, I get a slide. Yeah. Port Cate, they gotta go do some new search and they do some research. But make some more of those funny pictures your famous for. Right. Fourteen hundred e9 votes on George's pulleys that he who has the biggest ego in the world. Rush Limbaugh, big fat, kill pop, and every crit Rush 339, Donald Trump, 2013. Although I do like the fact he told Bush. You're fired. George's WWE of show himself, 241, Howard sperm, a legend in his own mind, the master of height, 177, Martha Stewart 92, Mohour David at 65. But then again, that was before the shaved head of the. Right. Right. Right. And maybe people in the audience think we're making that up. That happens to be true. I've got it verified by a whole bunch of different people in the building. But he actually shaved it and they said to, I mean completely bald. At least the musk red gets arrested. One good thing. In honor of course of right. Nice going airmo, most 65 votes. Dick Cheney 52, Kobe Bryant 42, Ricky Tickie Sanchez 38, Col. The Doritianian, Son of Wad of Town, by the way, the guys still did. Dennis Miller 34, Barry bonds 29, Rosie O'Donnell 16, Steve Gildy Geldstein, 14, Don Amister, teen the I man, George Lucas 9, I saw a great. A great show was on, I don't even know where was last night. Two hour thing on all the 60s and 70s, Louvre's and all the great directors and that's a great and a crazy Sam Peckonpa and George Lucas and Martin Scresese and Francis Ford Coppola. It was great. George Lucas mean time after Star Wars, guess he waited 22 years and came back with, Star Wars Part 1. Star Wars Part 1. Yeah. What was that? Raspberry. Do you want to get stuff coming in there and pitching you out again? Absolutely. You said the **** bag out here and I didn't get a chance to talk to him this morning because you ran out of there. Fasten, you can say, when I was passing you can say, sorry. Great Reads 6, Sharon Stone 5 and Mariah Carey is got four. She's scary that Mariah Carey. And by the way, Louvre still says, no, forget about it. So that's that. Better get our pull for today on here. Although first of reminder, join QM in a Marlon side of the North Miami Beach, AIL House, 3227 North East, 163rd Street. Stopped by the wind prices from Philly to Marlon in the Mermaids, all of the bad news. It's still the same usual crappy low budget QM prices. But, you know, it's the Marlon's watch party starting at 7th of the night at the North Miami Beach AIL House. They pulled one out last night and maybe they'll pull one out again tonight. Here's our pull today. Who do you think is the most underrated actor? Movies or TV of all time? They're not going to understand the question and they never do, but that's okay. Anyway, Kate Hutchins behind a beta curtain today. I don't have any bio-eye, what's she on her? Gold is daughter. She's right. That's why she's got the job. Right. Who do you think is the most? I'm going to put on here, Lee J. Com. I just lovely J. Com. He's so good in you. Huh? Very good. Yeah. And you got Brian Cox. See you, OX. He was the first animal left. He's been in a million movies. He's going to be in the board supremacy. He was in board identity. He was the main guy. Brian Cox. Brian Cox. He's in a million movies. We talk about him often. Not you and I, but me and other people. Hey, Brian. Are you happy? Yeah. We're going to die, too. Oh. Oh. Ron Brian Cox. I guess. Did you return me onto the board identity? Right. Remember the evil old guy, the guy in charge of all of the evil doings? Right. And so, as you actually watched the movie with Matt Damon in it, right? I did. And I even borrowed it from a friend so that I could watch it all in its entirety. I'll see you later. I watched it and sniff it. How about the new one? More not in the, um, whatever it's done. Yeah, but I'm going to go see it. It's not? That just yet. I think this weekend. Well, I'm sure it's held. There's sure, uh, click on a hell out of it. There are a lot of spots on there. More four play than shack. Speak it. Then. Wow. That's a lot. Oh, wait a minute. WDQM. Hello. Who am? Hello. Yes, sir. How about Gary Olvin? Gary Olvin. Perfect. Guys. How good day Neil. Thank you, you too. And don't forget to see this guy didn't even say hi. You got to say that when you call. Because parents have been very upset if you don't. We don't want to shortchange. Yeah. Because we're all just on pins and needles. We're shaving it and we're a twisted it and pulling it. Because we're all excited about. Yeah. You got it. WQM. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Good morning, how are you? I was wondering, when do you think the IOD is going to go in change or call it or the WR and C? Right. And I was listening to this. What's the speaking by the way of talks of a, uh, it's a sea channel. Error America's numbers are dropping like, uh, you can't even find a anymore. They have that initial little, uh, interest. Nice going there, people. Do you put them on or when nobody cares, but anyway, go ahead. Also, too, I was listening to, um, I got that satellite radio in my truck. Right. Like left wing, talk ring radio and all that. And they had a guy on on the right wing, talk channel. He was talking about the, uh, the marriage amendment, where, you know, the gay ban amendment. Yeah. He says, well, they wanted, they wanted these liberals say that this is the first time they want to amend the constitution to take a person to take people's rights away. But that's not entirely true because after the Civil War, they amended the constitution to take people's rights away. Don't slaves. Right. There you go. That's a good point. All right. Forget. Chuck. Don't forget about it. All right. I won't. See, I want to clap. We got the big shack press conference. In fact, uh, they're warning me that those things never stare out. So anyway, this is a true story. Clarence practically was begging. Oh, please don't do any of those drop-ins during the press conference. Can we just carry a clean. I said, no, you know, we're going to stick around here. Let's see, at least have some fun drop-in if you like to add or maybe one of these like to solid. And so that the people that don't give a flying crap about track, which I realized that there must be many of us. Third man. Third, million. Uh, we could at least get a little amusement out of it. And that sent him into like a, I would say, a quasi-panic when you said it's a good way to describe it. Okay. Yeah. And so we went out of the hallway. Had a conference with himself and probably with Miss Ma for whoever. And came rushing back in to say, oh, well, and you can leave it one or whatever the press conference starts. Have a nice day. Okay. Fine. Let's work more money. That's our motto. We didn't have the little dog on this morning. No, Joe Rose. We had the big. Oh. Boy. Profusely. Good guy. Like I said, but boy, we, uh, I apologize. Right. We want to apologize for fucily. Especially eight o'clock in the morning when you want to try to stay awake. He is coma inducing. He is not rock solid. I'm for you to report. But anyway, so when I'm going to leave it one o'clock or one, one of the things starts. Just what's the way. That's what I'm going to do. And then whatever it's done, George will be there to pick up the pieces. Got an idea. Thursday. We got the Marlins game of one o'clock. We're going to play a game of 1230. So this business of just, you know, it's like a little cameo appearance here at a cameo par answer. Just keep the text coming.

Yeah, yeah, yeah Pally U.S. Media kill story that Iraq prop Prime Minister executed six prisoners. We don't want to talk about this doing Yeah U.S. Media is surprisingly failed to pick up the shocking disclosure by Sydney morning Harold Osirate his leading newspaper But if you rank you Prime Minister E. O. LAWA personally executed six suspected insurgents In a bagged-ed police station The story by award-winning Australian journalist Paul McMigau said that the prisoners were handcuffed and blindfolded Line up against the courtyard wall and shot by the rakeep Dr. Arawia's leds to told us around him that he wanted to send a clear message to the police How to deal with insurgents two people leds their witness to killings and there were also claims that the Iraqi Interior Minister and former American men were present as well And I'm lined up against the wall Flying full of that up in He said the polar gun proceeded to shoot at he only killed six of the seven there were seven them Six of them died the seventh was wounded in the chest, but he's still he's still hanging on Just like going across it and they keep him hanging on now. What he said something like that Think with let's hear it for CBS. I never thought I'd say it Let's hear it for CBS because Viacom ain't copresent and CBS Chairman Leslie Moonvae's vow on Sunday to fight any fines Levitt against CBS on TV stations for airing Janet Jackson's Respiring Super Bowl for Formus in February The booby track. By the way our booby trap is still going strong on our website. You'll be pleased to know In defined remarks the television critics that their annual summer meeting Moonvae said the government's crackdown on an In decency on the away since Jackson's notorious flash of nudity on his network is coming Deen he was like close to infringing on free speed Dangerously close.

An animal rights group plans to release a video tape showing slaughterhouse workers with a KFC corpse supplier jumping on live chickens and slamming them into walls apparently for fun on newspaper reported Tuesday. Ready for that? I thought that was to turtuturize them. After KFC officials saw the video tape yesterday, they said they would seek to smistle of the workers inspect the slaughterhouse more often and end their relationship if the cruelty was repeated the New York Times reported.

Bush's drug main oil company Harkin energy and in the 90s they made common cause with his father by investing in the Carlisle group In the 91 Gulf War the Saudis and the elder bush had fought side by side and now there was the repatriation of the bin Laden's which could not have taken place without approval from the highest levels of the executive branch of George W his administration Only Bush in Banda are know what transpired the day on the Truman balcony, but the times between the two families were so strong That allowing the Saudis leave America would have not been difficult for Bush It would also have been a character with a relationship in which decisions were often made to elaborate and Contraved the liability mechanisms that allowed the principles to turn a blind eye to one Singly we alleys and to be intentionally out of the loop the ties between the two families were an open secret that in some ways was as obvious as The proverbial elephant in the living room give it the same time with somehow hard to discern even for the most seasoned journalists perhaps that was because the relationship had been forged all over the globe and Arctochross different errors from the Reagan Bush years to the Clinton administration to the press and receive George's W to understand its scope and its meaning or one would have to search through tens of thousands of forgotten newspaper stories Read scores of books by journalist and historians and study myriad secret classified documents and records of barely Remembered congressional probes of corporate intrigue and Byzantine government scandals One would have to journey back to the time of the birth of al Qaeda as a terrorist training camp during the Afghan war One would have to study a ran Iraq war of the 80s the 91 Gulf War in the Iraq War of 2003 One would have to try to deduce what had happened within the corporate sweet civil war in Zendales and Houston in the executive offices of the Carl Al Group in the situation Room of the White House and in the grand-world palaces of Saudi veianaires One would have to interview scores of politicians or executives counterterrorism analysts CIA operatives and businessmen from Washington and Saudi Arabia and Texas One would have to decipher brilliantly hidden agendas and purposefully murky corporate relationships Finally one would have to put all this information together to shape a continuum a narrative in which the house of Bush and the House of Soad dominated the world states together in one era after another Having done so one could come to a singular inescapable conclusion namely that horrifying as it sounds the secret relationship between these two great families helped to trigger the age of terror and give rise to the tragedy of 911 I just mentioned in passing goes most people are gonna read the book or the whole article or whatever or whatever Even though I realize that has nothing to do with anything like that Let's see Christopher walking The best act was that he had nothing to do with Robert Wagner's wife drowning.

Fox News is used to the slogan Fair and Balance constitutes the set of advertising to political advocacy groups, claim the yesterday. In a position five with the FTC. Liberal move on dot org and historically nonpartisan common cause of surp that Fox News reports are deliberately and consistently distorted and twisted to promote the Republican party of the US and an extreme right-wing view point. Allegiance consumer fraud to complaint calls for the FTC to order Fox News consistently the highest rate of the cable movement that we're facing to this is from using the slogan. Our renaubergante of Fox News spoke from until the AP that while this is clearly a transparent publicity stunt, we recognize all forms of free speech and wish them well. In a statement later Monday FTC chairman Timothy Muiris indicated the petition has got a little chance. I'm not aware of any instance in which the FTC is investigated the slogan of a news organization. There is no way to evaluate this petition without a right away in the content of the news at issue. That is a test of first amendment, at least in the American people not a government agency, but Charlie Pingray, president of common cause and the legal actions were consistent with the first amendment. Fox has no obligation on it to a lot of be firm balance just not to market itself as firm balance. He said after press conference, I'd better to that press conference actually told somebody something. You think so anyway.

PS1 when you and Jack begin to get it. Oh, so lame. So tragic. So pathetic. What is your problem, Greg? I'm dying of the hair. Yeah. Alex Pinello's will present Jack a key to the county and declare today, Shaquille O'Neal Day. Oh, baby. Shaquille O'Neal Rogers is that it?

A lot of other people over here, including the Catholic Church and some other O'Journe provocateur Graham, and finally showing appropriate and somehow I've survived. But God forbid if, don't take the humor in his show, then we're in deep due to even though we don't care that he seems on his radio station. And probably never will.

Stop me if I'm from Barney or too much here to share. Anyway how he says after I showed up his numbers drop it. No, I say that's a bunch of mission gas. For those of you who don't take a piece to you, this that means crap. That's a good guy though he's what you might call a loose cannon. He's got a pretty bad temper on him. I remember one time when the right kids left the cap off of the twist based. I thought he was going to blow a gasket. The veins popped out in his head and that white spit strings were born in the corners of his mouth. Even Machuga, I spent 23 years with his shagots. Most of the time he's a manch, but on occasion I hate him. I think my husband Howard would make for a very good president.

Oh yeah, I've got to get to search for it. It's just that people email me stuff during the show that as far as like a Significor reply, which I don't have time to be crapping around with. It's okay. I'm trying to do a make believe radio show here until the shot comes on. So they're actually carrying on on the tube for hours and hours and hours. And I was about to forget that anymore.

And nothing, what even the and why and nothing. Most of the heart disease experts who urge more people to take cholesterol lowering drugs this week have made money from the company selling those medicines. How do you like that? The consumer groups on Friday blasted the new cholesterol guidelines as being tainted by the influence of major pharmaceuticals that make drugs such as Zokor, lipitor, protocol and all the rest. Last year drug makers are in $26 billion worldwide on cholesterol away medicines. The top selling class of drugs. The new guidelines issued yesterday by the American Heart Association, the new federal and federal government were aimed at preventing heart attacks. They were written by none of the countries that was last Monday, not only countries top cholesterol experts, and at least six of received consulting or speaking fees, research money, or other support for makers of the most widely used anti-cholesterol drugs. And did you notice that the stuff that they did propaganda they put out last week said, oh, get your cholesterol down as low as possible. Get it way, way, way down there. Yeah. Well, I've read that if you're cholesterol, if you're overall cholesterol numbers are the one-40, pretty soon you're going to be saying. I'm dying on the hand.

The voter protection coalition said FDLE agents while contacting people who's absentee ballots are in a question revealed their side arm, spokeswoman Alma Gonzalez said Friday.

Gonzalez said also the coalition believes the investigation that our campaign workers for the get off the vote. If it's by accident, he ballot's disenfranchises minorities. The coalition is asking the US commission on civil rights to counter-faith formal investigation. I don't know if that's right.

Incredible. And anyway, I hope you folks are having one helmet time man. I hope you just have an ace. Sweletime. So I can say because we had him on the air right here on QM. Baby, each of your hardout clearance. Okay. We don't have a way for your bogus press conference there. And for that cranson between eating two or three lunches there. We had him right on here live exclusive on radio anyway. Because the other sports station Augustine on the air. So for that, the band is foster thing. They're probably playing Haitian melodies in between the paid sports shows right now on that thing anyway. So there you go. There was a little taste of what he had to come. I wouldn't she give. I thought she said chicken. I sure hope wasn't Kentucky fried because we know about those bad. Beaton and abuse chickens. Turned her. Yeah. Tenderized against the wall. I think she said. See him. Is that what she said? Oh man. I understand in barbecue place that the barbecue seemed. And chicken and stuff like that and read. I got news for her. What his money. He don't have to be mad. Okay. Beaton fill him in y'all and every day. Whatever he likes. I sure am on it. Yeah. That's a good joke. Oh, we're going to be so shack in season. We're going to have a chat coming out of your ears by the end of the day. If you stick with us, you're on Q.A.M. Clarence. You're such a mumbling little mighty corn man. You're a silly person. Oh, speak of that. Former professional hockey player. I'm sure you didn't talk about this yesterday. Did you? Did I talk about a hockey player yesterday? That's why I said it. Yeah. I'm going to try to get his agent killed as part of a plotted unravel when the would be hit man turned out to be a police informant. Former saying, Lewis, play or Mike Danton. Clearly guilty to murder for higher conspiracy charges could pay seven and ten years in the slimer when he sends October 22. Danton was to have been tried and September with code of defendant Katie Wolf Meyer and was scheduled for a pre-trail hearing next week. Then 23 in Wolf Meyer and 19 year old Colis Dune from the San Luis Severe. Face identical conspiracy charges with Wolf Meyer accused of trying to hire that would be killer offense agent David Frost. It would be killer eventually went to police. Frost was unharmed. Then's Vingeal. Ever since he was arrested April 16. What is his real name Mike? It's not Danton. It's whatever it is. I can't think of it. It's not here in the story. Anyway, they've talked about that endlessly here because they're hockey of Cessavir as opposed to there were there of Cessavir now, or at least only for a couple of days to look. They were it out. They have ordered out yet heavy. He owned a McGee Irish and President had coach by right. President former had coach by Riley. Sam Van Gundee. Thank you so much for bringing you to Kielone. Here to stop Florida. He is the playoff court. So he must still be feeling the effect. How to handle outguns and it's there where they think that they're going to get the back of the police. I didn't like that little hockey talk here. Well, to do it all, I check crap in South Florida. I really feel badly for you, okay? I feel bad that you have to be there in the midst of all of that.

These onion rings really really really honest to God. Onion rings. Yeah. honest to God with real onions in them. Wow. Lightly battered as opposed to just as opposed to say Burger King. That gives it like those little golden crystal of a crisp of batter. And that's it. It was nothing that went inside. And they also brought like chicken sandwiches. Real chicken breast fillet sandwiches. These weren't the chickens that were smashed against the wall of KFC. They were tender but there were no cleat marks on it. Okay. Right. What else salads? They brought some chicken salads, big gut salads. All kinds of things. Now back in the day, I would have suggested that if you find those marks, those defining marks on a chicken they would have been called. Yeah, our fracks. But we can't say that now. No way. Twentracks. Right. Let's see what we got on the pole here. Now let's move away from that real fast. Let's fly away from that. Who do you think is the most underrated actor movies or TV of all time? William H. Macy has adsed in the first eye. Lovely. Macy. Right. Especially in Magnolia. Especially in everything. I mean, he's ever been in. He was seen. Right. 60 votes. Gary Olden 50 lines. So he's right on Bill Macy's ass. Which the role he played in Magnolia probably even enjoyed that. Robert Duval 46. And look who's in fourth place. Yeah. Although Robert Duval did hop over him, which must have been quite an accomplishment. John Q. 71. Steve Bushemies got 27. Gary Sinesee 25. Lee J. Cobb 24. Phillips-Symor Hoffman 23.

Everybody's got at least one. 567. 560. Con 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good. I want to ask you this. Sorry boy. You know, he's embarrassed by it. I asked him. He's embarrassed. Yeah. Totally. I think the worst thing that he said to Shack was you can kiss my rear end. That was unacceptable. That was a little over the top. I know he's not too happy having to do all this crap. But when he looked at Martin and the face and said, You can kiss my rear end. Little over the top. 560. I just gave the number. Well, you know, I mean, I'm a little out of sync here because all this is staring in. And of course, not being there like jica would say I'm out of touch. Jica and town is you right about what's happening local. Oh, no. He's not in California getting winded by him and smoothed again. Who are you kidding little Tommy? You kidned anybody? Not us. WQAM. Hello. Good afternoon sir. Good afternoon to you. I don't know why I bothered coming back from BCA. This is sick. This is beyond sick. I know it. I mean, what is this? Basically having the wife. I mean, this is I'm unbelievable. I don't know why I have no life. Yeah. So anyways, if you have never gone to BCA and I don't know, I don't know if you think I've heard you say before you really need to get out there. That is a beautiful area. That's what I hear everybody says. It's yes. It's paradise. I mean, it is just unbelievable. One up to up to which we're going to have the 2010 Olympics. Right. And it is just unbelievable. I think we're here. It's smoking up there. It's what I'm hearing. Yeah. You got it. Okay. All right now. Take it out. Bye. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. The outsiders looking in and they say, oh my god, so I thought it was done again. Oh my god. They're making a bunch of fools of themselves. They're making a bunch of clowns of much of monkeys out of themselves down there. What is going on? Oh my god. Oh god. Oh. See. And this, I'm going to tell you right now. That's just because QAM is for six sports nerds. And all of the rest of the media is just as sick as we are. But it's because there were such a girth, such a lack of any kind of as earnest angely would say substance. Is neither one of us says that or is it what's it Vinnie Haley? I'm sorry. Different hairdo. Such a lack of substance, such a lack of anything. Nothing. Zero. It's like a vacuum. It's like a human cesspool. So no matter what it is, it's just overwhelmed. You know what it's to me and Danny, whether it's Jay and touchy, feely, whatever it is there. And by the way, hey, to break the news, the dolphins are going to really suck this here. I don't, I shouldn't say that probably. They're going to have a brutal year. I'm thinking like 7 and 9. WQAM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Hey, do a body. Pretty good, pal. All right. Quick question for you.

How many movies he's been in? The guy, five. And he was Barzini. Oh, that's right. Richard Conti. Great actor. I can't hear anything. Richard Conti. Who? Within it's light. Some Conti. Oh, that weight. Harry Conti. Harry Conti. Harry Conti. You're getting really that kind of thing. Harry Conti confused. And you're rickering him with Barzini, man. I said, no, no, no. It was Barzini all along. You're losing it. What's the kind of stuff? I think you're... Exactly. Good point. The Jones is actually visiting and found from Indiana. He's got lucky enough to be shot. Ah! Oh, right. Oh, I'm so jealous. He got lucky enough to see Shacka, but he's rubbing himself Roy. So excited about it. Oh, man. This is right here in Miami. I mean, I thought it was unbelievable.
