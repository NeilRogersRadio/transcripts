The entire building is usual at WQAM. The station was off the air briefly in the last hour, and everything is usual technically at the ZASTER, but we got 247 broadcasts, just as the engineering department tells you. As everything continues to be a big gigantic floating turret at QAM, and any rate everything here is great. Sure, the internet is the network, just to be accurate. Whatever the hell it is. In the phone of course, sir goes along with that. In the phone of course, sir goes along with that. Right. 2018 votes on our podium. Today, a shocking total. We had over over half a million hits on our website yesterday. Hit of course rhymes with bit, bit, Schmidt. Smit. Smit. Anyway, which of these is most important to you we asked? The presidential election 686-686-32.9% about a third of this audience. That's the most important. My next orgasm 614. When will I see Janet Jackson's other teeth? 435, you know, somebody very careful in saying, because although, although the headline in today's New York Post says, Where'd I listen? Oh, geez. Why I had it. Said, tit for tat. Yeah, I like tat. He gets on. Yeah. And anyway, that's what it said. No, I see they changed it. Says, do O'Cott and booby trap. It did say tit for tat for just a second or two, and then Michael Powell saw it. No better change that. Let's see. When will I see Janet Jackson's other booby-435? Will the dolphins make a playoffs next season? 96, and of course we already know the answer. No. Will I go to heaven 76, silly people? Where are the WMD's 75? Will the government take away my guns? 41 dangerous people. Will the Panthers make a playoffs this season? No. 21. Will I burn in hell? 19. And will the US allow case to marry 17? I'll tell you one thing. If you people don't stop looking at those graphic pictures, we got a Justin and Janet on there. Yeah. You're going to burn in hell for sure. Just wait to put more on. Are we spawns? Yeah. We're going to start putting a lot more on that website. Somebody will be able to see it unless you get your network back one of these days. Yeah. I sure hope you're network isn't CBS. Boy, if I got some good stuff here today, it's a good thing. I mean, you can punch up the phone there, but I'm not playing that game today. No. So if they ever get to think and fix it again, the network, so I can see what's going on. I have control over it fine. But otherwise, bug off George Corso, you idiot you. I know it's not his fault, right? This might be, like I said, it's his fault. He's an idiot. First of all, the National Football League being the very upstanding folks that they are. They've released a statement. I got a call here. It is so good. By Alessandra Stanley in the New York Times after flash your flash CBS again is in Don't I? So look at that much later on. Oh, I got, I got piles of this stuff. The best thing of all before we get to Mr. Tagliab booboos is that tagliab boobi. Before we get to his statement about this gross test episode is that CBS last night to show how we're more fully really are a Dan rather teased the story for the entire newscast. And finally at 65 is their last story. They finally put the story on there again. How many million times have we seen just an ripped that thing off that boobi of saloon in the last 24 hours? How many million? About 30 million times. At least over. And of course all of these super marvellous they're telling us as they're showing this to us how unacceptable and disgusting and disgraceful this was. So look at it in that terrible. Yeah, let's get it again. You just engaged you missed it the first time here it is in freeze frame and slow mo. But nobody's got a better boy that Eric the deemed himself yesterday man. Nobody on any website anywhere has got a better montage collage of crap. Then we got the stories that stories concerned, right? Right. Click on that picture and then start taking a peek at all the other things that start popping up and falling out. Maybe that's what happened. Maybe they just had a falling out with CVS. Which is why they're threatening to take them off the Grammys next Sunday. But look at to that anyway Paul Taglia boobie says. We were extremely disappointed by the MTV produced half time show. It was totally inconsistent with the show and says our office was given about the content of the show. The show was offensive. I don't think so. It appropriate. I don't think so. And embarrassing to us in our fans. We will change our policy. Our people in our processes for managing our half time entertainment in the future. In order to deal far more effectively with the quality of this aspect. This aspect of the Super Bowl. That's as with one aspect of the Super Bowl. That's the statement from NFL Commissioner Paul Taglia boobie and regard of the boobie regarding Janet's boobie. Now, you're post. I mean the national post you're in Toronto today is going to say sensational. It's the best. I'm not going to read the whole thing though. At a Toro, the bowl and the bust. I'm just going to read two paragraphs which I find most amusing. And keep in mind that the rest of the world is laughing at you America. I just want to tell you that again they're laughing. They're holding your sides. They're scared crapless on a one hand. But on the other hand they're just they can't help from peeing their pants. From letting themselves profusely over how silly America is once again over a little bit of nudity. Just a little teeny tiny. But not even a nipple, not a nipple. You'll be pleased to know though those who are very concerned about these things that the FCC is now investigating not just that little segment there in that little boobie. They're investigating the entire half time Super Bowl show. And commercials too, like a one would be farting. And then the one with the little kid that's seen a mommy reaching up in the cupboard and her skirt going up and there's her uh, Brettoam ass. There's her ample ass. They're investigating all of these things because Michael Paul now is more than just chairman of the FCC. He is now a rice martial uh, Paul. With new and expanding powers every moment. And you will not say these things and you will not titer and uh, well, pardon me anyway. That's right. Anyway, the bowl on the bus national post says. According to Michael Paul, the US Federal Communications Commission chairman, children, parents and citizens deserve better than this classless crash and deplorable stunt. Take a deep breath, Mr. Paul, whether the incident was a simple wardrobe malfunction as Mr. Timberlake claimed, and ever by Ms. Jackson to throw out her upcoming album, or a bit to prove that she was not in fact her brother Michael, it's hard to imagine that a fleeting image of a plastic surgeon's handwork will be what corrupts America. Mr. Paul is ordered an investigation of the CBS broadcast, but this overrought proved aside, we suspect him. That is the greatest line of this behavior. This overrought proved aside, we suspect the majority of America's hand rig is already moved on. Hundreds of millions of fans went home or stayed home happy on Sunday night. Most of remember the game's great plays vividly long after Janet Jackson's breast becomes the answer to one unusually obscure question in some future edition of trivial pursuit. What a great article by the umptious right way national posting keep in mind this is a very conservative paper and yet they find it just embarrassing and humiliating and it says, uh, take a deep breath, Mr. Paul. This overrought proved aside. Meaning you Michael Pollard you silly goose you asshole, okay? And I'm saying that very enthusiastically because the deal becoming very soon when we can't say asshole on a radio no more. Okay, the white one. I or even white on a. That's right. Unless maybe it's with handy wipes very independently to very lightly. I've fact I think we'll all have to get a bidet just to make sure that we clean all that crap away. I got mine. Good. Good for you. Anyway, here's the a new poll for today. Not that we want to milk this thing. See now that's enough. Oh, I want to get carried away. You pre we want to milk it. Yes. Okay. I know what you do. Sure. What's your take on booed gate? Just an engine that's super bowl. That's our question today on theorajers.com. Hopefully we'll get another end we are ready again in the rezoning. In case you missed us, see all those wonderful pictures on air. Those TV pictures take a look at them today over and over again. Especially the one that's animated it's in its in motion. He put the motion in his basket as just in his reaching across and just rips that baby. No. Just rip like I said right there. It was close. What's your take on booed gate? I loved it when I can't go. One can I see more. It was shameful. The FCC should stick it to him. Yeah. The FCC should stick it all right. I think it really wasn't accident. Now, I noticed I think was the Sun Sentinel water papers to control on his yesterday. You people are really believe that this was an accident. Man, when we study the Brooklyn Bridge at that point, really nobody really thinks that. Wow. It was totally contrived. I loved it. It was totally contrived. I hated it. Haven't seen it. Which I don't know where those people are. And they must have somebody must have stolen their TV. Even on the animal template a channel that we're showing it. Discovery channel. A crocodile heard that. A and E they were shown it. Or grow up America. You boobs. What a great list of choices there. What's your take on boobgate? I loved it. One can I see more. It was shameful. The FCC should stick it to him. I think it really wasn't accident. It was totally contrived. I loved it. It was totally contrived. I hated it. Haven't seen it or grow up America. You boobs. Another magnificent poll. If I do say so, my son. Common it's after 10 to 5. 60. WC. By the way, don't forget our hot couples contest is up. Speaking of all this perversion and filth. And skin and flesh. That Michael Paul is so envious and humiliated by. Oh my god. Don't look at that movie. Look away son. Let's see. 2. 3. 3.

So we have a situation where the lead administration person on the grill and the lead manager on the bill in the house are going back to work for the pharmaceutical companies. Nancy Pelosi says, I think it would be important to the American people to know when they negotiate for these positions began. And this bill he tells him by the way, he's also one of the leaders against the importation of prescription drugs from Canada. A. Because they're dangerous because God only knows what's in those Canadian drugs. And drugs in the 10th world country. And it might be filled with SARS. Oh, we're getting commercials about that now. Okay, so you haven't seen them up there. I guess you wouldn't. Same. Why? Well, when I want to say that, don't I get the Buffalo and network affiliates? Yes. I guess you do, but I don't know if there's specifically targeted to Florida. People, because I only saw it once. Same. Same. Saying that drugs that you get from overseas are dangerous poison in the, well, guess what? Canada ain't overseas last time. I guess we're talking about that big ocean that separates Canada from the West, talking about other countries. Right, which is also fallacious, but he's leading the fight against the Canadian, they're putting all these people out of business. Because God forbid they should save the American public. Any money. God forbid they shouldn't interfere with the pharmaceutical companies. Wrapping the American public. Just raping and raping and, oh, just gouging. So that senior citizens have to choose one month between pain and the rent. And next month, maybe between being able to get their prescription drugs to stay alive. Things like that. Lies in there more outrage and screaming and howling about that, just wailing and gnashing of teeth. Why I'd like to know, you know? How come? Why? Exactly. So this, and I want to thank personally, Janet Jackson and even Justin Tinkerbell, who might as spies like poison. I want to thank them both, because look what they've done for us. Right? Can you believe it? Sure, just think if it had been a couple of attractive people. 424 votes on a poll. In much less than an hour, I think I went up about 1018. 424 votes. Do you want to hear how many hits we have on our website? Or you'll have to tell me. Take a look at your thing there. Which is it. If you ask me that again, you're going to start seeing dots and stars. You understand that they don't believe me when they come in here and they tell me that it's working. They won't take my work. It's not. It's not. There's nothing here. It will not come back here until you're in an a connection's back. Believe me. We've been through this a million times. I know a little something about this. Hold the old view. This whole set up. I've been doing a long time. 130,000 hits as of 11 o'clock this morning. Do you ready for that? Okay. Shocking. Amazing. Here's another one. You're going to like a lot before we get back to the important news of the day, which of course is. Who gate? Suit alleges Walmart. Locked sandwiches and the stores. I'm sure you've seen this. No. You haven't seen this story? A civil rights suit filed against Walmart by Mexican immigrants has been expanded to include Plainus from Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic and to accuse Walmart of locking its janitors inside stores during their shifts. A lawyer for Walmart denied the allegations. The Walmart people are the A.L. and take least though and a chupa cabra and whatever else you can think of. And they'd chelluba too. For years now. Oh, guess who's going into Walmart's blinpees? Did you see that? Oh, well. Have you seen that? No. I see. Look at what you're learning. I'm a pound of knowledge today. Yeah. Yeah. Squirt Court. Mondays amendment to a suit filed of Ember 10 in US district court in Newark, New Jersey. Comes as a federal grand jury in Pennsylvania. We're evidence to determine whether America's biggest retailer will face criminal charges. We can only hope and pray and use of illegal immigrants to clean its stores. On October 23, an INS agents raided Walmart stores across the country. In a suite that resulted in the arrest of hundreds of janitors. I know we're immigration charges. Among those arrested then were the 17 named plaintiffs in the civil suit, including 11 Mexican immigrants, who were working in stores in New Jersey and Texas, and made up the original plaintiffs, plus the six East European's amended to the list of plaintiffs. All but one of the janitors named in the suit have been released by an S custody pending deportation hearings and remain in the West including nine in New Jersey, two in Texas, one in Alabama, two in Florida, and two in Virginia, so Gerard Gilberto Garcia, other immigration lawyer. Garcia said one janitor voluntarily returned to his native checker public. So let me get there a lot here. The suit alleges that the employees were locked in stores with warnings from managers not to use emergency firewags. It's for anything but a fire or they'd be fired. I'd be like that. James Lindsey, lawyer for the player said he in other words decided to re-invue their clients. Then amend the suit after reading report in the New York Times last month that contained a separate allegation that janitors were being locked in. The original suit claimed some workers being forced to work seven days, seven hour weeks, for 1,500 bucks a month. Now let's see, figure that out, 1,500 to 1,400 to 1,400 to 1,000. Less. Yes. But say 400 to 1,000. 70 hours to 400 is what? You ask me to do that? About 5 bucks an hour? There it comes out to about 5 bucks an hour, and Walmart being locked in a course. David Murray, lawyer for attorney said the allegations were absolutely incorrect, absolutely. Incorrect is what he said. He said his concern for workers' rights was the reason the channel made use of cleaning contractors in 80% of its stores. Murray acknowledged that the doors were kept locked, but insisted that a manager with a key was always present. Just in case anybody had a like, you know, go running out into the parking lot, screaming and yelling and carrying on like lunatic. Right. So there you go Walmart and Billy Tozen. I just throw those in because we need just a little bit of a variety. Are you going to punch up a call real quick? QAM, hello? That's good enough. We're bad enough. That's 2% too. I told you. Man, thank God that my psychic powers are scary. They really are. It's frightening. I'm proud of this enormous pile of stuff.

That's the last walking tour of theación corner store, I think the And all of a sudden, it was like a re-wakening. How's that thong coming by the way? Anyway, here's some shocking news before we get to that article which I really will. Drug could block SARS infection, this from the BBC, so it might actually be true. Although 20 blurred doubts it. A body chemical that could wipe out the virus that causes SARS may have been found by researchers. Oh, right! In theory, drug based on the antibody could be available long before vaccine could be produced. Antibodies are created by the body's immune system, or launch attacks on foreign invaders such as bacteria, experts from a Boston cancer Institute look through a library of human antibodies before they found one which worked against the SARS virus. Their findings reported the journal proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences are a further chapter named remarkable worldwide scientific effort triggered by international concerns over SARS. How do you like that? But, I mean, that's as... The work of produce of vaccine is well underway. This may not be available for some time, and sciences may in key to find a first line treatment, which could be given to, I'm vaccinated, a patient's exposed to the virus, and they're showing they got like pictures here of the antibodies, target the SARS virus, and the antibodies look like green gummies. Do you ever see gummies? Gummies bears? No, not gummy bears. Like a worms? Yeah, gummy worms, right. Gummy, gummy internet worms. That's a little bit of a seven news. So, of course we have SARS. I don't have to get all panic again. I don't have to go into quarantine when I come back. And that's George Corso, for a man, a real rocket scientist. In fact, I say put his ass on the moon. Jim and Atlanta's got a very good point, and I think he's got his thumb right on the a problem there that you got. Yeah. But now what is this? This is not another role. Tell Miami, I'm bringing the latest. Southwood? I don't know. There's a some kind of a situation in Southwood school in Miami. Did you see that? That was from WSVN. You better turn on WSVN right now, Channel 7. I got it. And put it up. Of this students that only confirming that the student died in the bathroom. Now we can't tell you that an ambulance was called out to the scene. Perhaps they were trying some type of rescue. That ambulance, so was called off, which obviously means a very tragic ending to this situation. So at this time, Tom just a recap, there are not saying who was involved. How old the student is or how that student died only confirming that that student died in the boys bathroom. Richard, for some very concerned parents gathering there at this staging area, which school officials have set up. Have you gleaned any information into what they are telling these parents? Right now they're trying to tell them first and foremost to remain calm. What they're doing as I said as we zoom you back into the scene. They're telling them to head over to one six one street and idiot Fabene. Now you got to realize these parents are very emotional because their loved ones are inside this school at this time and again, the school is on complete lockdown. That means no one can go in or out. But as to not hampered this investigation, there's only so much police can tell them. So what they're trying to do is keep them in this cural area and at this time keep them calm. Richard, I know you're just arrived. But what about the safety of the young students inside that middle school? Have we heard anything about that? Are any of the other students in any kind of danger? What we can tell you and having spoken to Miami Day Police, they are saying that this school is secure again. We keep mentioning the lockdown and as you look around everywhere, all over this campus, you are seeing officials from Miami Day Police and also Dave County Public Schools. There are officers outside the school and also inside. Telling us that all is calm inside and out. Okay, well that's enough for right now. There's like keep well keep by in touch from that was WSB and breast of it. A student, now that's so bad man, I can't believe you said that. A student has been found dead in the campus of a Miami Middle School and police are investigating police a Southwood Middle School and 163-01 Southwest, A.F. Avenue in Palmetto Bay in South the Dave County is in lockdown mode. The incident apparently happened in the boys bathroom and they just heard. They don't really know anything more at this point. Wow. Yeah. At any rate, or as so Jim and Atlantis is just a thought on the technical problems George and W.Q.M. is experiencing. Maybe if corporate would spend a few dollars on some engineers and quality equipment as opposed to cheaping out through a B. less problems. Well, Jimmy, you are. He says it's apparent you don't have any issues in Canada because when it comes down to me, you don't cut those corners. That is correct. They built me a beautiful little studio here in my apartment. Everything is top grade. First class was put together by people who know their stuff who of course weren't from Q.Y.M. except for Hulu, it was long gone and it's a fact of the worst every day just by clockwork. In fact, people when we had the power outage was it last week? Okay. I think it was a week ago today, wasn't it? Something like that. And I still have my battery pack here, my 30 minute backup so that you know you hear the ticking, we were able to do the whole thing. Didn't even lose never skip the beat. Are you like that? I like it a lot. But of course, when you win a QM student, not only you've got to combat the viral infections from the events and the filth and the mung and the gigantic chupacabras that are running around because they were so cheap, they weren't even higher an exterminator in there. That's what we need a QM as a fricking exterminator if you catch my drips. Don't play that thing. Why not? Because the audio vlog just went down. You interrupted me because I was just about to say, yeah, don't go a ton. You were always going to more fun doing it that way. Yeah, that was a pretty exciting. So as you're audio holder, the whole building. Oh, we don't know. I see. So I was going to say before you interrupted me with that sweeper. I'll go into the break yet. No, but it was more fun that way. Yeah, sure. Because it kind of underlined the technical incompetence. People think that I am belished these things, making them off them, just being hard to ask or just doing it for fun. It's crap is what it is. It's a technical incompetence at its worst. And of course, when you've got absentee management all the time, when a general manager needs a round of vacation or hiding from everybody or crawling in his spider hole, whatever is going on, it's really kind of difficult. And of course, when the middle level management people are also hiding out of their desks. Hey, Josh is right there. Like I said, possibly they can play this thoughts out of the control room, right? Yeah, possibly. And possibly, like if the audio holder there is working, that might work out for us. It's worth it. These people since we're here to make some money and not to like illuminate the public, the illuminati or not. Anybody, let me do the promo while he's checking that out. Sure. Join Kimba Bocamp for broadcasting live. We hope today, I'll owe you never know on this thing. From 4 to 7, the David Vustu's in Hollywood. Good luck, Kimba. You'll need it. The Marlins caravan will be stopping by with player signing autographs five to six to saffronon. The World Series trophy will be on display and Billy the Marlin will be there as well. You can throw like tomatoes and eggs at him. Hey, four to seven to saffronon, the David Vustu's in Hollywood with Kimba Bocamper and the Marlins and the Gossipish Broke. Yes? So what's the Billy the Marlin? Why? That's all. Forget about that. Let's look. Oh, you're starving for time now. Yeah. Why? Play a song. We're not going to be taking a break anytime soon. So in other words, they haven't found if they're going to be able to play the spots from the other. They're scrambling in the old course, but it's not. So let's see. We have no phones working here on our internet connection. We have no internet period in the building. The audio vault was his all of our commercials, which is what we're here for is to make money so that Greg can go around and pretend to be a sports V shot. That ain't working. Other than that, everything is just fine. Unrelatable. Yeah. Oh, we're fine. Right. Okay. Not a lot. I don't want to hear a Sarah. No, I mean, we're not going to do the break is what you're saying. Ah. We will do it eventually. You mean like like like next Friday, maybe? Maybe. What? Unbelievable. No guarantees, of course. This is just phenomenal. You called this big market radio? Well said, honey. Well said. Well said. 514 votes in just over an hour on it. I've got to do that like really just stimulate your internal organs. We're read to go in the other room there. So you can ready to go with one. The break. Oh. My and local. We're sports video 560. You a yeah. Yeah. You know, yeah. Why? Yeah. Why? That was the rejoin. Well, I hate to break the news, dear. See, what? One thing I goes on here is I continue saying, I don't want to pick on Josh, but I'll say I need to come. I can't hear anything. So when the spots were playing, I heard nothing. If there was a rejoiner heard nothing, because it's coming from the other room. So evidently, the pot isn't open there. So I have no idea what's going on. And of course, I'm saying on the inner come. I'm here with nothing. And I do this all the time. And it's like the sounds of silence. This station stands for nothing. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Oh, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's drive the athlete and steadily on the ground. Not the person who are unwilling, but its 피ately has the happiest find. So partners must think things in.

Ooh, they're pointing something at me Yep, it looks like six heavy artillery machine guns How they get those past security Go! Hey, Skittles, I'm Spanish I'm a signman at the A-D-D video reasonable Oops, they shut me again It's 14,000 at 5,60W, so anyway, Alexander Stanley writes in the York Times today After flash your flash, CBS is again in denial Wardrobe mouth function was the term just in ticker bell used to explain why he buried Janet Jackson's breast at the end of their Super Bowl to wet Like erectile dysfunction a term used in halftime advertisements for a sea Alice It was a somewhat starling euphemism If Monday morning quarterback ceremony guide, few people thought it was by accident That Mr. Timberlake's hand snaked across Miss Jackson's torso As he reached the lyric, I'll have you naked by the end of this song And tore off on boosty a cup Releasing a breast partly obscured by a sunburst shaped nipple broach The gesture seemed timed more than the music The very next commercial was a close of a Miss Jackson's cleavage And a got a promotion for next week's Grammy Awards on CBS Miss Jackson denies that the nudity was deliberate saying the Mr. Tinkerbell was supposed to replay only the top layer And leave a bit of red lace behind And nobody really has any reason to believe CBS when then ever consisted Didn't know the bodice ripping was in the worst That is not just because MTV produced a halftime show for CBS in both companies Rown by a Viacom One does not to subscribe to conglomerate conspiracy theories to be suspicious CBS is told so many hollers over the past 18 months that any claim to dig me and marches in ignition by the snowboard Is now offering news open to snickering CBS insisted there was no quid pro quo when it sent A Jessica Lynch led a suggesting that an exclusive interview with CBS news of being Rewarded with other liquid of contracts within the Viacom Empire CBS insisted that its decision to cancel the mini series the Reagan's had nothing Do with their right wing lobbying campaign that threatened to boycott advertisers' products And the network insisted that it didn't swing to deal with Michael Jackson's secure 60 minutes interview with him After his arrest last November as the network was preparing a Michael Jackson entertainment special In plausible deniability and the fungible walls between news and entertainment And between art and commerce existed every major network But like a high school student caught smoking pot by the principal CBS can hardly wriggle free by arguing that everybody does it The beauty of the Janet Jackson to do is that it could be the one case in which CBS is telling the truth And like the little network that cried wolf nobody is listening The chairman of the FCC Michael Powell was watching however He called the incident a classless crash and deplorable stunt and called for a thorough and swift FCC investigation The NFL also took on bridge huffley announcing it was unlikely to invite MTV to produce a half time show anytime soon. Perhaps the legal turn to MTV's rival cable music station VH1 That should work VH1 is also owned by Viacom Even trust as she was in a shiny matrix dominate for South Atlantic Jackson 37 Has never had much luck being taken seriously as a sex symbol And it's unlikely there is super bull surprise will be much help there But if her aim was to grab all the attention as Madonna did when she kissed Britney's spirit at the MTV video music awards Then she did herself proud And if she wanted to distract attention from her older, more famous and now more infamous brother Michael Then she achieved even that for a moment Her sudden flare or pre-gramming attention in publicity came at a slight cost Perhaps the one moment of honesty in a coldly choreographed table was when the cup came off And tumble out tumbleed what looked like a normal middle-aged woman's breast Instead of an idealized playboy bunny implant The NFL was apparently put up I'm up to the MTV hack time show not just Miss Jackson's unenvited breast And what can I understand the leads confusion? Does anyone who loves the CBS hit everybody loves Raymond and Joe watching hip-hop singer Nelly Repeatedly grab his crotch as he did during the halftime show Viacom like Gull is divided into at least three very different parts But if the NFL was really so shocked and appalled, why didn't it flinch at these C-allocid Verdezment that promised men 36 hours of relief from evidence Then warned that if they should experience an erection for four hours straight They should seek immediate medical care On television sincerity can be measured only by sacrifice if the NFL really found the halftime show so objectionable Perhaps it should reconsider giving Super Bowl rights to the highest bitter And instead select the network that promises to adhere to the NFL's self image of wholesome good fun CBS could decide to can't risk another such risk a solenoid it deliciously still refers to as its broad cast standards And recuse itself from carrying the Grammy awards a never-sweet bread and morse can be best judged by its willingness to lose ratings And CBS so far has shown none Very good beauty by Alison Rostanley in today's New York Times Except for that part about mistaking her breasts for a real one Well, no, we're saying a staking it. No, that's not what it said It isn't what it said It's said outnumbered what looked like a normal middle-aged woman's breast instead of an idealized playboy bunny implant In other words, I ain't no big thing. Okay, ain't no great thing. What she's trying to say In other words, even though she's you know things she fancy yourself as a sex pot It wasn't the fact so much that it was such a great looking dress. It was that it was her and she's famous and outed popped in like all of these things Same for biscom right So nice to a column in the times. Let's take a look at how that pole is coming out here. We're making any progress down there. I know that's really is your internet connection back. Oh no And do we have any like see because what I'm thinking is that maybe that worm got in there Yeah, no today's the day today is the big day for the worm. No, the same worm. It's not a worm. What is it just the usual the a network is down human worm? I see I did know that he had an in a fix it. I know it's yours. How wasn't what's his name? What's his name? Your buddy 596 votes on a pole. What's your take on boob gate? Grow up America you boobs driven 16 53 per a percent say it's time to grow up and stop acting like a bunch of little chillin. Of course those are the same people that look and I've over and over again It was totally contrived. I loved it 95. I loved it. Where can I see more 66 and thank you can see lots more every day on our website. We are pledging as of today Since this is such a gigantic thing I've been allocendrosism wasn't that gigantic every day. We're gonna have like naked people on their famous people right on now We're gonna leave that one here until everybody's like exhausted from until they've worn it out. No, we'll pressure it out We'll milk it as much as we can It was totally contrived. I hated it 54 It was shameful the F. D. C. Sheard stick it to him 47 7.8 percent you'll go Michael Powell stick it to him. I was disgusting I haven't seen it 10 and I think it was really an accident eight out of about 600 and I want a half Aren't you shocked? I'm amazed and no Getting back to that pull because I think I've exhausted all of my obubis stuff. Oh no. No, well actually this one's good. I like this story Many of these are on our website today near watches that come now those of you who are spending hours and hours looking at that booby picture And I just in ripping up You might have somebody read you some of the good stories we have on there. You know, you might not be too interested, but you never know something like catch your fancy Senses at the FCC checking wind direction The propriety police are making an example of bubba the love sponge The same culture warriors who allowed the communications conglomerates to run over the idea of the public trust are now making political a hey over in decency Rather than worry about health care or education this election year, we're supposed to focus on steroids and sports A manned flight to Mars and naughty words on a radio In stressful times when weapons of mass destruction remain elusive, crusade against smut And so the FCC last week slapped record setting fines on a funny radio TV stations and a congressional subcommittee opened hearings into broadcast and decency standards Clear channel was fines 775,000 dollars for broadcasting various episodes of the ronchi bubble on four stations in Florida as well as for lousy bookkeeping The FCC also finds San Francisco's KRON TV 27,000 dollars Frationally exposing the genitals of a member of the cast of puppetry of the penis visible for less than a second and profusely apologized for by the station The Bush administration backed the indescribergate pressing to increase punishments on broadcasts enabling the FCC to boost the maximum fine from 27,500 to 275,000 dollars for incident Will a tinfled increase in the fine solve the problem of shock shocks? Will a slap on a risk to the perveres of bubble the love sponge elevate the culture? No and its is dangerous as ever to let the government regulate program content This latest round of the culture wars began when some in front risk became upset that the FCC decided not to find NBC for airing an explosive uttered by you two leads in your bino during 2003's Golden Globe show Underfire from constituents on the right FCC chairman Michael Powell colon son has asked the commissioner overturn that decision Find him get him stick it to up Margie we high instead of the pre-expression policy project a left the center thing think on artistic and intellectual freedom said that while the current indescribens he dust up as a great distraction, it doesn't accomplish anything This is an issue that does come up in less than years that politicians think is effective for demagogy that is a mistake according to Elliott Minkburg Legal director the liberal advocate is a group people for the American way We need to look at the standard for indescribens he and how relates to other media like cable in a comprehensive way rather than do hit and run work in this area he said That is considerably multifaceted media world as it is today not as it was when George Carlin spoke to famous 720 words eight million years ago The SEC complains that bubble seeks to pander to titulate and shock listeners Personally I find fear factor equally obscene to the lady and pandering to base human instinct in prime time on ever TV It's 2004 South Park has been on the year for eight years the fuss over Howard Stern is a faded memory the media universe has changed radically Pay cable internet and shock radio vaulted landscape and the governments interpreting the problem awfully narrowly Have we learned that prohibition doesn't work that there'll always be a flood of mindless perverse junk floating through the pop culture along with the worthy artistically valid socially redeeming junk It doesn't matter the SEC if the material in question is artistic mirrant Carlons the terrible monologue was censored under the vague patley offensive definition Similarly in 2001 the SEC by nonprofit KBO and Oregon for playing feminist poet Sarah Jones your revolution the son making fun of the size and as rap singers The agency reversed itself on a Jones case this year response to a lawsuit the FCC also reassured or a reversed itself regarding a clean version of m&m's real slim shady The agency has trouble keeping up with his own shifting line on an indecency. Let's go down a little bit more and the interster is on our website Boy that's important to 1150 step in at five sixty Q a m I'm proud Juliana And I like rubbing my snowed reels as with soap made from dors and listening to the near okay, I'm gonna use the hour I Looks like a problem when He's leaving her clothes all over your floor Knowing it just a minute or two we are gonna score My wife, that did he be stupid People gritt needs to stop your things Kable not to bite on chewer when gritt needs to stop your pain Speak softly, dreamin' And clean up your planes Because she wants a brand new thing In your dreams It's a 12-1 boy like a brook boy those always in So we got the phones back and in fact listen to this I'm right, I feel a little bit more secure now It's like the linus with a security blanket I think maybe Tuesday will be chaos day last Tuesday the power was right here And it was on this end but of course that's not the studio that was just the area Yeah, we'll just plan for it promote it Every Tuesday will have like some chaos Which are you and you don't really have to do a lot of planning Cause generally it happens anyway, although it's usually Monday Right, Tuesday Monday after all the children are in there playing with our studio And of course, Duff and Clare's well nobody's supposed to be doing it Yeah right, talk about impotent man See Alice, that's the one more time I have for Duff and Clare and see Alice And even that won't help Boy you talk about a couple of limp guys Rick says I just voted on your pool I can't believe all the upper over a breast boob tittier But everyone is called it everybody needs to grow up and stop acting like a child Who's just swiped his father's playboy magazine and seen a booby for the first time If women can breastfeed in public then what the hell is the big deal But no they can't You haven't got To the end of this year Okay, he's Canadian a early she wants to He said Alicia at a nipple ring covering most of it Even my Canadian professors are laughing at this see tell that and cover to make some room I'm coming to stay says Rick Can't breastfeed in American public or they're going to throw your ass and a rest of you okay now don't interrupt because I want to finish this story because I realize that the rest of this When you when this and all the pieces are starting to fit together now, okay you'll understand why Michael Paul is so indigently now and about the timing of this all ears This is the rest of the story that was starting to be before we were so early in the ruptured by commercials by Joanne Ostrow She says fuel more and if a growth test call in radio shows such as Boba the love sponges totally enough But as Hein said giving any government agency on bridled power to censor whatever it seems patently offensive or indecent depending on the political climate as a dangerous proposition The hearings title can you say that on TV and examination of the FCC's enforcement with respect to broadcast indecency are convenient platform for Elbrent Bozell the third present of the right wing advocacy group parents television counsel He expressed his pleasure that until last week the FCC had never find a TV station for indecency See other pieces starting to fit together now Uh-huh What constitutes indecency and how does it different from obscenity? You know it when you see it or hear it on broadcast TV and radio, which you see on cable and the internet doesn't count Under FCC rules and federal law radio stations and over the RTB channels cannot air obscene material at any time It cannot air indecent material between 6am and 10pm The FCC defines as obscene any material that describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and lacking serious literary artistic political scientific scientific value and decency isn't as bad as obscenity, but it still makes references to sex or excretions Times a lawyer and author is written extensively on the issue notes the FCC's unique among government agencies in that it has the power to censor talk shows political dialogue and artistic endeavors on radio Intellivision it finds them too ronchy, but the zealousness with which it performs this job tends to vary with a political wins The wins today are decidedly sensorial At the start of last week's hearing, updense at the point is protecting children adding has nothing to do with censorship There are things outside the scope of the public airwaves that unsolicited denial tells you everything you need to know It can't help but be about censorship. It's also about politics There you go Michael Powell, seizing upon this opportunity to like rattle the spirit of decency and Christianity and goodness for all the world to laugh at I mean to see and well, these are important things admire right Okay, now let's get that phone going baby all the stuff I've been rambling on here for too long excruciating hours And now we got phone contact with the outside world.

How you doing? sensational You know it's kind of ridiculous and hypocritical with all of the two to the violence they have on TV It's just ridiculous if they have to spend all of the time money in effort over one boobie and It just it just even got me worse yesterday because they had I'm talking to nation on NPR. They were talking calling people calling in and they had this one guy I had said we had a high-end of children's eyes. We were in a church group and they should find them up the max and then they have a government And we have this other woman call and then she says I'd rather my children see something left and the violence you see on TV And what you do you know it it's just a matter how far this country is split apart and it's just ridiculous I want you say all of these people left I took some girls from Sweden today back to the airport and my cat and these girls are laughing That would think about one boob and that this many all of this time and money in effort And when they say when we were young and all families went to the beach together and when some of the time came And we were in a close and all right just ridiculous that fall behind the rest of the world we really are Well John asked off his product guarantee of that he's getting ready to put his that sheet over the entire TV screens like clean it up I don't know you can't remember most of all the local mail We'll stick in have a great day Yeah John asked off your attorney jail man. He's sneaking the sheets over the naked statue boobie So why should come in surprise when you got a booby for president why should they be surprised that people should fear boobies right naked or otherwise Put in sheets over the boobs on a statue you could put an eye out with one of those. Oh my god. It is absolutely I mean See this is what you do with in a country where 90% of the people have never really been in any place You go to Europe and any city over to any city over like 10 people has got all the like in Rome all the statues and all the old artwork And the boobies and the penis is not a body part because guess what that's what people look like. Oh no How the hell of a man and and like a stone's show from the freaking Vatican no less I'm surprised to Pope doesn't have his people out there covering them all the naked statues all over Rome. I'll keep him busy keep away from all the mullter boys and the swish guard But like I've told you for a long time this is what the government does the government likes to keep people American public are treated like a bunch of little children and the government has to keep injecting itself into your own personal choices Whether it's about you know a woman's body or whatever it is You can't do this and you can't do that and don't do this and like I've told you also for years The NH do know a harm as long as you don't mess with children or harm anybody else that as far as it should go That's the law man. That's it Anything else mind your own business. You got to join over there to stink and bad Whatever it is. Enough of the bullcraft all these important things go on in the world and you got a bunch of goody two shoes Supposed religionists who are all by the way a bunch of funny grave robbers who are all a bunch of perverts behind the scenes behind closed doors They're doing anything that moves but they're pointing at you and saying self-righteously don't you dare do that because that's gonna bring down a morality of our country Yeah I'm just thinking about penis gate. I'm thinking about how outrageous and unersetable that was Right to think that the president actually went through the impeachment proceeding Because of a couple of blood because lying about a couple of blow jobs right about something that wasn't anybody else's damn business. This is a bunch of who he amen Because of a stain on a blue dress from some slut that took her presidential knee pads the Washington and man Of course the media made her into like a celebrity into a fat-tubby piece of crap celebrity. Oh, we have to feel so sorry for Monica Right I'm sure that he just propped her head up there and probably had like two assistants there Propting her head up in his crotch right Corsing her into that squat position. They must have been very strong assistance that they were propping her up especially a tub of crap like her Twelve minutes passed new. I don't want to get excited and I'll bet out of shape now because I'm not gonna change America, but I think actually that this incident I think this is like stirred something it on me right I think it's brought the American pubic today They're retention there's something that they were like yeah, just take it for granted Wake up and sniff the pansies and the daffodils man You got a bunch of Nazis who wanted to sign everything you can see and and what life should be all about America wants to see hot look at naked people which leaves her out at least that's a start Okay, start out with mediocre plastic looking people nimble move on from there Britney's next Brittany will be next on a on a Grammy's next Sunday wouldn't it be I can just see it now Man Christina's all peer stuff That's what Brittany just Brittany just has a tear away the whole outfit Remember she had the tear away outfit that one year was it last year?

Local peace and social justice activists have joined together with Panzan Fire Organizers to bring the traveling statue of George W. Bush, shown with his pants on fire as in liar liar. The people involved locally are not members of any special organization. Don't represent any such organization or simply a group of concerned citizens. We will told the statue on its trailer around Southwest Florida for the next few evenings while making these allocations against George W. Bush's protected by our first member, right to free speech. We present to follow these statements as evidence that Mr. Bush represented facts. Yadi Akih, killed over 500 American soldiers, which he didn't text me the rest of us. That's OK because there's four pages on a one. I didn't think so. I'm going to be all around South Florida. Over there on the West Coast, the Keperation were simply a group of concerned citizens. We will tell the statue on its trailer around Southwest Florida for the next few evenings. While making these allocations against George W. Bush's protected by our first member, right to free speech. We present to follow these statements as evidence that we allocate that money to the after school programs that have been cut. To drug prevention programs and to full-time substance abuse counselors and schools. A study published last April by the Journal of School Health found that drug testing in no effect on reducing drug use among middle and high school students. The BPA notes that only five percent of schools have drug testing policies, making it highly unlikely that testing could have played any substantial role in the decline of drug use among teens. Meanwhile, even as the president credits drug testing for a decline in drug use, it is drugs are, I'm getting choked up about it. His drugs are John Walters head of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which is also taking credit calling the drop, a byproduct of $150 million anti-d drug media campaign. Few were teen and by the way, the drug reformer said that that drop 11 percent is due to surgery to begin with. Few were teens are using drugs because of the libert and serious measures they've received about the dangers of drugs from their parents, leaders and prevention efforts like our media campaign, Walters said may December, O and DCP press release. Unfortunately, a study released January 19 by the National Institute on drug abuse directly contradicts Walters claim, according to a four year NIDA Commission study conducted by the N inverse School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, there is little evidence of direct favorable effects on youth. By media campaigns, not that the NIDA studies like that we have the much criticized ad campaign instead, it may signal the end of independent evaluation. According to the ERC net, the O and DCP following all these initials, has successfully lobbied to end funding for outside analyses of the media campaign. Instead, assigning their job to its campaign cohorts the partnership for a drug-free America. And then it talks about how CBS wouldn't allow the move on.org spots on a Super Bowl? But they did take the edge from the White House about drugs? According to recent polls, 72 percent of Americans favor marijuana decriminalization. Let me read that sentence again. According to recent polls, 72 percent of Americans favor marijuana decriminalization. Normal's Chris Krain noted in the press release, so the O and DCP's one-sided ad must be considered an issue ad, and subjects for the networks policy. On January 23, the DRC net reported that after reviewing the issue, CBS declared the O and DCP ads is not controversial, which is why they ran in between the naked movies around before and over an underneath. On Sunday. ABCBS Randers, hoping that, you know, it can be throwing the Bush people a bone.

Just too much heavy duty crap going on here. It's unbelievable. Anyway, New York Daily News. Bob Raceman says last month, Vano you would choose lead singer. Last NFL suits if he and Jennifer Lopez could perform a dovetoring the Super Bowl half time show. Vano and J.L. wanted a singer who suddenly recorded together an American prayer, which highlights the fight against AIDS in Africa. The NFL said, no, no, to Vano. We simply decided that we are going to deliver as we do annually and extremely entertaining half time show and NFL spokesman said at the time, we don't believe it's appropriate to focus on a single issue there they go again. Except drugs of course. Unless of course it's Janet Jackson the star covered breast. That particular anatomical structure was the focus of NFL's halftime show Sunday night, like some sort of avenging angel, commissioner Paul Taviabub, now speaks of turning future Super Bowl halftime spectacles into suffrage at meetings. As the income for bear body parts and body shaking, don't count on it. While Taviabub, along with all corporate entities involved in Sunday's halftime production, have publicly expressed their cover your but version of proper outrage behind the scenes I believe they're thumping their chests properly covered of course and jumping for joy. Throughout the history of the Super Bowl team he never saw the media outlets have tried aggressively counter programming against the game, especially the halftime show. The idea is to take viewers away from the Super Bowl so they have returned to the game telecast. There's been stuff like a special edition of Saturday night live or some perwrestling extra vegansa or some other kind of special, Sunday night it was the lingerie bowl on paper review, a squadron of scantley-clad models squared off in a football game that went for 1995. Walt the NFL did on Sunday was fights a laziness with, a had-to-head battle of bumping grind, the PPV gang trotted out beautiful bodies, the NFL cutted with foul mouth crotch grabbing wrappers and misjacksin who had already given the national audience a peek. Remember the flash drive she pulled off on performing Black Catathal 1990 MTV Video Music Awards of Arassets. No question the NFL won this battle of the buzz, lingerie bowl promoters, today they must feel like a bunch of boobs. As Tadley-a-Boob looks down the road he doesn't have to worry about viewer infections from a Super Bowl halftime, even if the commissary is out as promised to sanitize the vet awareness for it already has been heightened. Leading up the passive of the bulls near the public or media carried much about halftime extra vegansas, then all change when misjacksin has just in timberlake said, experienced a major wardrobe malfunction Sunday night. The Escala business standpoint tagly a boob and company should be pleased. Almost as happy as Fox Network suits will reap the benefits of this controversy during the buildup to next season Super Bowl which they will air. Tagly a boob probably was disappointed or went down on stage in Houston Sunday night, even the most cynical cannot deny this. That said tagly boob has only himself to blame, he's the man in charge, he's ultimately responsible for all of the elements of the Super Bowl. That's why he continues to engage in some sleazy corporate maneuvering, tagly a boob as PR machine are using MTV as the scapegoat, blaming that company because it produced a halftime show, who hired MTV is via comm MTV's parent company, is via comm CBS's parent company? See tagly booz. hammering it through CBS or via comm because those company service NFL bankers, tank through the nose for TV rights to the AFC playoffs and Super Bowl. You don't mess with people or overpay for your product. MTV an easy target for tagly a boob, the way he sees it MTV is a company used to controversy, if it's right in with MTV's image. So make MTV the bad guy and an attempt to extricate the NFL from a message created. As tagly boob or his colleagues ever watched MTV, when tagly boob hired MTV produces to book Super Bowl 30-a-a's halftime did he really think that we're going to present a triple bill of air supply, yany and John Tesh? In the long run despite tagly boob's righteous indignation the NFL comes up a winner once again the league has stumbled into a good thing, and a thing Janet Jackson did all this without once whipping out her cell phone. There he is. A nice complex rumor. Remers in San Jose where the Panthers and every dimension did I. No. I was talking about your free luncheer not going to get the big always on at eight eight to ten. Oh, or seven whatever it is on seven to ten. Then you got panthered people with ten o'clock to panthers on her west send nation. The NFL comes up a winner once again the league has stumbled into a good thing and a thing Janet Jackson did all this. What's she got on the other way? Someone suggested maybe the moon was on the other one. Somebody wanted to know if the pastie was tasty. I guarantee you just an ain't going to be able to answer that one. Trust me when I tell you. How many votes we got on a poll? The thing is starting to pile up again here. It's just unbelievable. What's your take on boob gate? Grow up America? You boob's for 19. 51.5% out of 813 vote. I think we got another shot of a thousand again today. Could be how can this thing have such momentum? Such big mo. A smooth momentum. What? It's got legs. A boob would legs. Man can you see that? I'm picturing it right now. The attack of the rugged boobs. Anyway, grow up America you boobs for 19. It was totally contrived. I loved it. 123. I loved it. When can I see more? 103. It was totally contrived. I hated 86. It was shameful. The FCC should stick it to 54. I think it was really an accident. 15 idiots. And I haven't seen it 13. That's for autos who don't have a TV again. It's for agarity. It's going to be on every channel you see. Let me just punch up every random. Any channel right now? Twinkle. What do you say? Nothing. What the? The couple's on. Okay. So single guy showing up the door. Doesn't seem to be a problem. But what about the cost? Well, swing an eight sheep. There you go. Boy, how about talk about right up your alley? Man. Well, that's the playboy channel there. A bunch of perverts anyway. We all know that. Uh-huh. And like it a lot. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, need pound 5, 6, the on the AT&T and Verizon wireless Lime. I have some technical problems before. You know something is probably just as well. I think it was an active. Oh, good. WQM. Hello. Chambas. See what I mean? Right there. I know an instant proof. WQM. Line 9. Hello. Hello, Car Victor. What is the charge of online there? What is it? The one of who is the charge of phone lines. In charge of phone lines? The phone service? Yeah. You're in charge of your ass man. Right. Can't believe he's calling online 9 now, you know it? Well, that's pretty. WQM. Hello. Hello. Yes. Hey, you know, listen, everybody is going on and on about this boot job. But yes, they are. I'm going to explain a big thing out of this with all the security and flight things and so that it's used in that disguise able to march on the field like that. Because the reason I'm not talking about is because CBS covered up with the CBS eye and all photos of war or crime site and they were so much. I wouldn't have acknowledged everything going on on the field. That's right, because they were terrified that anybody would see any new to the other. Plus, plus I finally did see a clip that they took from fuel level and the guy was a big fat pork or any way. So, we didn't need to see it, but they could have still talked about it. I mean, it just is just child plague. Exactly. So, like I said, treating American people like a bunch of overgrown children man, and we're like a charm. All right. See the order. See the Irofals man. See the casino. 1256 and 560 QM. We got the mad dog, the angry puppy coming up at 2. My eye and local, who your sports radio 560 QM. You A M. It's not just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon. You adore them. You idolized them. And now you can join them in their most personal movement. Just when we made you think reality TV couldn't get any better than finally you're asked. Box presents celebrity toilets. Watch all your favorites, celebrities go do do. Rosie Houdar. Dr. Phil. Oprah. Fear. Trista and Brian. Oh. Oh. Barry's healthy. And cover. Oh. Even the Christmite George Boy. Which I don't have time for because I got to get to this move on. Do I work thing which is pretty good. Yeah. Yes. All the celebrity. Trista and Brian. Oh. Oh. Barry's healthy. And cover. Oh. Even the Christmite George Boy. Which I don't have time for because I got to get to this move on. Or think which is very urgent and important and great. Okay. Under the guys of promoting sound science, the Bush administration is advancing a policy that could make it more difficult for federal agencies to protect health and the environment. U.S. scientists say a White House office of management and budget O.M. Be bulletin drafted an August 2003 would allow the government to handpick scientists to second guess scientific research upon and say the text of the bulletin says it's purpose will be to ensure that all research affecting federal relations such as environmental or health advice is will be thoroughly peer reviewed by on-biased researchers but scientists feel the government is common during a team that is near and dear to their hearts. It wouldn't be peer review as we're used to said William Schlesinger, person of the ecological society of America, which represents 8,000 scientists in academia government in industry. The O.M. Be bulletin would require that peer reviewers be independent of the agency involved when it comes to significant regulatory information, experts receiving funding from the agency involved who perform multiple peer reviews for that agency in recent years. We just wonder if you want the same topic would be eliminated as potential reviewers. That would eliminate the topics written any given field scientists said and let us respond to the book. In other words, you know, environment, that's a bunch of crap. Right. Anything that evolution, not forget about that. Global warming, liberalizing. So this pacifies all of those cooks out there to big business cronies and the board again, the God Thumping cronies. The God Squad. Anyway, move on.org. Anybody who's a member or would like to be, or who's to the left of it till the hunt and is seconded of all this phases crap? Uh, click on we got a link to it on our website, move on.org. Yes. Dear move on, member, during the build-up to war, President Bush said the United States must not ignore the threat gathering against us. Facing peer evidence at peril, we cannot wait for the final proof to smoking gun that could come in a form of a mushroom cloud. We have every reason to assume the worst and we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from coming. On the Eva-Centany troops in the battle Bush asserted that intelligence scattered by this and other governments leaves no doubt, that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. Now David K. the CIA's chief weapons inspector has testified before Congress that these weapons do not exist. And an attempt to evade responsibility for the misleading statements that pushed the nation into war, Bush's announced plans to form an independent inquiry to look at what went wrong. An inquiry would serve the Bush administration well, would envelop the issue in a fog of uncertainty, the flag blame and under the intelligence services, and delay any political damage until 2005 after the upcoming election. But the facts need no clarification, despite repeated warnings from the CIA and the defense intelligence agency, President Bush and his administration hyped and distorted the threat that Iraq posed, and now that reality is sitting in the prison wants to pin the blame on someone else we can't let him. Congress has the power to censure this president to formally refer to the regulations trust. If ever there was a time for this it's now. If you are in our call on Congress to censure President Bush at moveon.org slash censure. It's clear that we have been misled. David K said last week, I'm personally convinced that there were not large stockpiles of newly produced weapons in mass destruction, we don't find the people that documents or the physical plants that you'd expect to find if the production was going on. Case said these things shortly after resigning from his post is Bush's chief weapons inspector. Bush in his 2003 state of the Union address said, the British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently saw significant quantities of uranium from Africa. In Ambassador Joe Wilson who was sent to Niger in February 2002 to determine whether Iraq would try to purchase uranium materials there conclude that intelligence related to Iraq's nuclear weapon program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat. That's the same Joseph Wilson his wife was outed from the CIA of our country. A CIA report in February 2003 said we do not have any direct evidence that Iraq has used the periods since 1998 to be constituted weapons of mass destruction programs. It's also clear that the misleading was deliberate. The respected Carnegie Endowment for International Peace recently found that the administration systematically represented the threat from Iraq. The basis for person in Bush's uranium claim was known at the time to be forged and not credible. Top art has officials knew that the CIA seriously disputed the claim that Saddam Hussein was seeking uranium in Africa long before the claim was included in Bush's January Dress to the Nation according to the Washington Post. Secretary of State Colin Powell became the larm that the level of intelligence distortion led the first half of his speech to the UN prepared for Powell by his vice president Dictane's chief of staff. He was so upset that he lost his temper throughing several pages near and declaring, I'm not reading this volgement. Our democracy only works when we know the truth. We now know President Bush and his administration deliberately misled Congress and the American people. Sensor is the least we should expect in response. I see impeachment be better, but we'll settle for this for right now. The independent inquiry will need a year or more to come to a conclusion accordingly Bush administration.

Under this reform, senior citizens have now been captured or killed to seize their assets. By doing so we can cut the deficit in half and it is right. Nice President Shaney, voluntarily pledged to dismantle public schools. We expect third graders to gamble their lives and futures on drugs. That's not asking too much. But unfortunately, 400,000 fewer young people are using illegal drugs than in the year 2001.

When he said, you know, the wedding pictures are so very sweet. Yeah. And then he went on to something else. Or what does that mean? The wedding pictures are so very sweet, but not ironic. But no, yeah, whatever. Whatever. They are, well, hey listen, if this is making a difference if they happen to be really beautiful, couple, they might still win it. That's just whoever's got whoever's got to get the most clothing. In fact, many of the people have entered our contest last couple years. We were praying that they would put some back on. Right. A lot of it back on. Please. But it anyway. So now there's what he's trying to suggest is more flash. Just relax. We just got this thing started already. I mean, just just come down. Don't you remember the last couple years that we can't we started? First of all, they got to go take the pictures man. It's so easy anymore. They got to take the pictures on their digital camera. Maybe we got some old fashion people out there doing their food. You stuff like Don. I'm a Sudracham. See, they have why we love code act because I'm from Rochester. What? disposable digital camera is not right. Absolutely, man. Absolutely. You can have one in your hand in a couple of seconds in a camera too. Just squeeze that little thing at shutter and score score. You know, you'll have something really exciting for us. Don't welcome and the pictures too. We got to 9807. We need to get to a thousand before to a clock or all of this fun that you're having right now. That may come to a real rapid end. It's always fun to threaten the audience, you know? Especially with you as the weapon. But we're not doing that this time. Because I'm really whipped up into a frenzy now. Like, I'd love to say they're back. Hey, don't get a clue, will you please? Of course, stuff an interest didn't only give female breasts, but that's another story for tomorrow. Halibutton in 16 million dollar food probe. We just just touched on this so lightly the other day. And you have no idea how I had a scour to find his damn story. Thanks, Lynn. Your friend Lynn Samuel's head to son of website. I'm a wish you're like, yeah. Oh, sir, so I kept typing in Halibutton and overcharges for meals. Anything out of the sun. Couldn't find it. Found some of the old stuff from December. We've identified out the latest Halibutton overcharges the way that big changes. Good buddies are raping the American public, including all of us. Halibutton company allegedly overcharge more than $16 million dollars for meals at the US military base in Kuwait during the first seven months. The last year, according to a published report yesterday, setting Pentagon investigators auditing the companies were. There are a bunch of grave robbers. There are a bunch of thieves. Your president's the crook. Your vice president's the crook. The uh, they're all a richard pearls and other crook. And of course, birds of a feather are crooked together. Because of the charges, which involved food service were done by Halibutton, unit Kellogg Brown and Root. The Pentagon has extended audit of KBR food services to include more than 50 other dining facilities in Kuwait and Iraq. According to an email sent Friday to more than 12 US Army contracting officials and reviewed by the right wing Wall Street Journal. The company issued a statement yesterday seeing it is not an issue of overcharging and to about finding a good way to estimate the number of meals so soldiers can get fed. It's difficult to determine how many people will be at the dinner table in the middle of a war zone and the number must be based on estimates. We plan purchase and prepare meals based on estimates they set at times. Soldiers are on leave or troops are shifted to other locations. Last month, the Houston-based oilfield services company had been to workers may have taken kickbacks to make a weighty subcontractor supplying U.S. troops in Iraq causing a potential $6 million overcharge to U.S. taxpayers. It set a $6.3 million checked in the U.S. Army material command its customer to cover potential overcharging. According to the Wall Street Journal, the latest disdudent falls meal served at Camp RF John, a large U.S. military base south of Kuwait City. In the email memo that went off Friday, it said that in July alone a Saudi subcontractor hired by KBR built for 42,000 42 meals a day on average but service only 14,053 meals a day. I guess I have to have about 28,000 spares just in case somebody else shows up. It's only triple the number of actual meals they needed. What if you invite a guest? A day? That's right. Or maybe the president might show up again without that turkey this time. That turkey will show up alone. Are you hooked up and get a date? Not the day? No, stay per mess, I.E. In response to the allegations KBR agreed privately Friday to repay the money until the company can prove that its billing procedures were appropriate that they were said, citing people familiar with the embarrassing ripoff situation again. Again and again and again. See, if you like, if you enjoy late, you know what I mean? Are some people like being raped? Absolutely. Right. If you like being raped and by all means, go for bushing again. You're all like it. Well, good luck to us. Go for a scary John Kerry. Well, speaking of a scary John Kerry, yes, like maybe equal time, I think this is kind of cute. Oh, that's not it. That's a wrong one. But it's close to it, you know? Senator John Kerry, congratulations on your second win in as many weeks as the field to win a new Hampshire. There's an unfairness. And I think most people in America see it. How do you expect to project your message now outside of New Hampshire, outside of New England, outside of Iowa? I look forward to going hunting with an AK-47. What are you prepared to challenge the Democratic Party on? I look forward to cheating seniors out of the real Medicare benefit, leaving millions of children behind cloud up the issue and making a mockery of the words. We have to also do a better job of reaching out to the world, run up deficits, trample on civil rights, and disrespect the Constitution that had her carry thanks so much for joining us. We'll be speaking to you many times in the days and weeks to come. Bring it on. And as soon as you sound, we'll, that dog won't hunt. And don't let you out the door hitch in the end. That's going to weigh out, whatever you said. Yeah, totally John Kerry a long time ago. So he's old and funny, dirty in the old man. Well, he hunted 23 after one at five, 60 WKM. Now what do we got? 9 or something? We're going to make a thousand or else. That's the end of that pictures. Credit play. Well, 914, they're starting to really pour in now. They're crap in their pants. They want to laugh. We're just getting started with that stuff. I think that by the way, yeah. Check out the website real quick and make sure that this campaign poster is appropriate. It's an old slogan visualized here. Yeah. One moment please, I have to switch over. I'm switching. Oh, nice going Tommy. All right. All right. I guess well, he's got that here of the kind of short here. Look, two now himself. So I guess it's spreading around. Short and here. Right. Read my lips. No more bush. Look at that. The Democrats do slogan. That's a beautiful thing. We're going to take that off. They're where unless you get to a thousand votes. Oh, see, you know what's going to happen? Now we're going to start the same crap that happened yesterday. We won't be able to get on our own website. What if it just come on a little bit? That is great. When you accomplish something, when you're more bush, that's a beautiful thing. I wonder if Janet would be a proud of that. Of course, it's a little bit like complexity to be Janet, but nevertheless, her name could be Janet. We know what do you think? Maybe you're almost across the old exterior. There's a really lovely sex pot, heading underneath that Prince code. Yeah, part of honey. Oh, my 19, we need anyone vote, but I think what you take a peek at that. You'll say, oh yeah, please don't take this away from us. Please, please. See, this is why as you, we all know, but I mean, nobody of course talks about just like the Billy Toeson thing. I had thanks again, Lynn, for that's the right to, which I searched for. Couldn't find. I saw it on TV and I could have scoured and confined it. People ought to be screaming about that being raped and ripped off by the pharmaceutical companies so that this son of a bitch can have a one or two an a half million dollar year job for many people from saving money on those dangerous drugs from Canada. Oh, who the hell are you kidding man? And what are they talking about? They're talking about boobies. I think her boob is a weapon of mass distraction. Make no mistake about it. You'll see now that we got that other thing on there. Now, you're going to see a real problem getting on that website. See, I'm just just like now, we're self-destructing. Are you refreshing yours? And that's right. Yours is back, right? Right. No, I got on all right. How many you got? Oh, I'm not on that page. I'm talking about on that page. Nobody does make any of his words page it is still shows you how many votes. No, no, no, no, I'm there obviously. Crawl in and crawl in and crawl in the long 19 never should next time it like a whole a whole bunch of votes. No, brood on it. I got nine to 26. See, they're coming in so fast. We can't even take three of us just to keep track to count up more than three. Look at that. My thing you just can't even it can't even make it through.

And my new album sucks. So I've got one verb that's here. You got that coffee high? See? As I said in the news, I love coffee enemies. See, they've happened to be back at it. That's why I'm opening up my chain of coffee and them of places called Starbucks. See, Starbucks. Starbucks. We've secretly replaced Janet's coffee with piping hot forger's crystals. One? You got those gloves on? See. Oh, I got that coffee. I got that coffee. Yeah, you got that coffee. 31 at 560. We got 958-42 to go and a half an hour. It's a tall assignment, man. We're blowing it up again. Are we really? Yeah. Well how many you got? No, I was saying amount but we're crashing the server. I don't want him to meet once. My thing is sliding right to you there, man. Just like a wicked worm. You're speaking of speaking of worms. Democrat it teaches a wall. Bush will be an issue after a nominee emerges. Which, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we really have to kind of wonder. How come I took them four years to get around? And this is not up. I mean, we all write about this before the 2000 likes. You of course, that was the fixed one anyway. See, you got to make sure this time you wouldn't buy enough that they can't fix it even with those funny divulged machines. With an Democratic presidential candidates campaigning across the country on Sunday, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee whose president Bush of being a wall during his international guard service, a signal that the ferocious campaign ahead, what Democrats finished with one another, beating the crap out of each other? I don't want to say who's beating the crap out of his friends. That'll be a clue. We visiting an issue that it was briefly at the end of the last presidential election. They chairman Terry McCollough said the expected Mr. Bush's record of military service or lack thereof in the 1970s to become an issue this fall, especially that Democrats nominated the front runner Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. Mr. McCollough said he was staying neutral in the fight for his party's nomination, but he said, if Mr. Kerry is the nominee, Mr. McCollough will relish comparing him with Mr. Bush. I look forward to that debate when John Kerry award hero with the Chistula medals is standing next to George Bush a man who was a wall in the National Guard. Mr. McCollough said on the ABC program, this week with George's step on top of us. I do like that. I like to do. I like to take it off the gloves and thank God for that. How many you got? 950 or what? 960. Ish. 960? Ish? Well, since I reloaded it. Now I'm reloading again. 969. Well, this is not even a- this is not even a- since we put that last thing up the floor. I mean, the Janet and Justin thing, they probably- you know, they've seen that 45,000 times. Actually, we don't really have that much response on our website. It's just the same 10 people. That's all. Right. Oh, right. Oh, right. And over again. They could- maybe they- maybe they bought some of that, uh, C. Alistagh. I'm a stupid bull. Oh, speaking of, uh, people do and stuff. 17 year old, uh, teenager, uh, his sentence for gay sex, I'll tell them Kansas. I think if we had to pick the two most in the NFL states in America, Georgia, in Kansas. All of a sudden be the one. You aren't they? Those are the ones. You have even worse than Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, even Oklahoma. Advocates for gay rights were outraged after the Kansas Court of Appeals rule that the state can punish homosexual acts between minors, much more severely than head of a sexual wants. Advocates for gay and lesbian, uh, and, uh, and this and that civil rights feature. What is that? The gay lesbian by sexual and transgender, G. L. B. To advocates for gay civil rights reacted with anger after the Kansas Court of Appeals rule Friday that the state can punish homosexual acts between minors, much more severely than head of a sexual and that's just more severely, but much more severely. In fact, I think I left one much out, much much much more severely. The two to one ruling effects Matthew are linemen who was sentenced in 2001 to more than 17 years in prison. Oh, that, uh, I can't read this. Because I'm going to cry. Come on. He was sentenced in 2001 to more than 17 years in prison for having consensual oral sex after he had just turned 18 with a book with a boy nearly a month away from his 50th birthday in a home for the developmentally disabled. According to state law, sexual activity with anyone under 16 is illegal, but if Lyman had been having a heterosexual encounter, he would have only faced a sentence of 15 months of the state's role in a human and Juliette law, which limits penalties for underweight sex between heterosexual teenagers. Like, because that's romantic. And, right, also, other than oral sex from another male. Oh, God, God, God, God. Oh, gross. This is the second time the Kansas Court of Appeals has heard his case in February 2002. The Kansas Appellate Court rejected his equal protection claim, but the US Supreme Court demanded the Le Mans case last year after its historic Lawrence versus Texas ruling, when a rule laws cannot treat the sexual conduct of case and must be in his differently, the net of heteros. Mitchell, Coutine, a Texas based attorney who participated in the Lawrence versus Texas case with Disappointed with Friday's ruling. These Supreme Court wanted to give the Kansas Court an opportunity to correct the case in the light of Lawrence. He told the Lieutenant out, whatever that work. How many Supreme Court cases are they're going to have to be before courts get the message that gay and lesbian people ought to be treated equally? Bob, third man. Kansas, George Henley, Henry W. Green, justified as ruling by saying, let us later, this could claim homosexual acts in tail health risks. We also wrote that heterosexual offenses are less objectionable because they could lead to being babies being born and same sexual relationships that not generally do unwanted pregnancies. I see. So in other words, thank God we just got the good news. You cannot get any kind of sexually transmitted disease from a heterosexual relationship. All right, go for it. It's insane. It's insane reacted Chris Hanton, a spokeswoman for the American Civilivities Union. The state is basically encouraging teen pregnancy, she said, that's right. All these straight kids out there banging your brains out because they may be able to have a less baby. Hey, now, like on passions, look what did for K. Don't listen, honey. Human rights campaign President Cheryl Jock since he hoped the issue would succeed. All people should be treated in the eyes of law equally. Yet this decision upholds penalties that have been decided target game as people simply to show this a proletzer, Kansas, where Reverend Fred Phelps is from Otenz, uh, funnels of people who die for maids. Kansas and Georgia. Sick. Six, six said. It's America man. And they're still arguing about the Confederate flag in South Carolina. You know, it's how a Tom Brokeh try to inject in the debate the uh, two days ago. Come here and asshole man. Just bug off. No, Robert. Let's see. Here's one. It says Tom Brady's making around. He'll be in Toronto next week to get the key to the city. Tom Brady will be in Toronto next week. Oh, Ray, Kyle. I better go into training. Oh, right. Man, I got my lip gloss. It says a question of CBS gets fine by the FCC for Janet Mr. Tim Mr. thinkable. Why doesn't WQM get fine? What's worse? Looking at Janet's Tata or looking at the Carlos, but he got out of the elevator. That's an excellent point. When the elevator works. Freaky Carlos says, Missy would publish, at least I get some ice cream now since you're not there. Excellent. You know what I tried and it's really not that bad tasting, but it just will make you part your brains out. Excuse me, Mr. Powell. I'm so sorry. Part your brains out. Is a soy ice cream. You ever have that soy? No, you ever see it? I don't think so. It doesn't have like, it's not like a regular milk price. Maybe a soy milk. Looking. It doesn't have anywhere near as much as um um uh carbohydrates. I don't want to just make a pleasure to go soy. And it also doesn't give you like the wild diarrhea, but it just creates this unbelievable bubble of gas in your ass. Parting your brains out of the ass. Huh? Ask gas. No, you pass gas. Oh. That's crashed. Now let's see if we got to a thousand yet, huh? Oh, 1987. This is like fall and off a slippery rock. No sweat, fall and off a long in the middle of Lake Oki, Toby. 21 till two. You know, I remember when I first came to Florida and and Sarah sold, I believe, was 1973. And I was reading the story. I didn't do the news, but I was doing a morning show and I was reading the story about something that said Lake Oki, Toby, is how I pronounced it. Oki, dokie. And somebody said to me, you idiot. It's Oka Chobu, you jackass. That said, Oki, dokie. Like you just said. You run it.

Well, we're Carter to earn your business. But the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil Gaugh. Well, a word from Howard Dean's wife. Hi, tell her. San Jack of Judas Steinberg. Clif at Presidential Kennedy's Howard Dean. You can call me Judy. Not Judge Judy. That's a different reskite. People want to know why I'm hardly ever on campaign trail with how he. Hey, did you get a good look at me in Iowa? I scared a crap out of myself. I make proud for this and I look like a shane of fooling. Stop me if I'm bombarding you with too much Yiddish. Anyway, how he says after I showed up his numbers drop it. No, I say that's a bunch of mischagas. For those of you who don't the Capista Yiddish, that means crap. How is a good guy? Though he's watching might call a loose cannon. He's got a pretty bad temper on him. I remember one time on the right kids left a cap off of the toothpaste. I thought he was going to blow a gasket. The veins popped out in his head and that white spit strings were born in the corners of his mouth. The vent machuga. I spent 23 years with this shagots. Most of the time he's a mench. But on occasion, I hate him. I think my husband, how he would make for a very good president. One of the things I'm a little peo about is that how he doesn't let us have a TV. I've run a watch section in the city. I got a shut down to campaign headquarters or to the crookers to watch on some tiny black and white set. I have never seen any program in color. So I'm not Jackie Kennedy. Hell, if you look at me, I'm no Ted Kennedy. I don't want to make up. I'm like a whisker away from being amish. Don't expect to see much more of me during the campaign. The only reason I'm addressing you today is because I was able to chew through my restraints. Anyway, Gazagazont, that's Yiddish for Dr. Judistine. Look, over and out. Pay for by the committee to select John Kerry President. 145, we got those big five par amyers and two caucuses. This is this Kofe Koforka, Kriven Kofyan and minister of this man with president Bush.

Ohio representative Bob Nase as an expert on the Middle East who appears regularly on the Fox News channel. Young. Has ties to an Iranian terrorist organization. Oh, right. It's on our website. Our visa, Jafar Zada, said Friday, is group opposition to a Rans fundamentalist Muslim government, doesn't make an terrorist group. The State Department added the National Council of Resistance of Iran to its terrorist list in 2002 because it had ties to Mujahideen, a Calkhay terrorist organization that seeks to overthrow Iran's government. Jafar Zada was the Washington-based Council's congressional representative Philistine Department closed its office in August 2002. Absolutely not. That's ridiculous. Jafar Zada said, but asked about it as the organization was a terrorist group. Yadiyadi. Now, he's simply not telling the truth. Nay, Republican Republican of Ohio said in the telephone interview late Thursday. Fox News officials refused to comment their mom.

Ujahadine, a Calkhay, M.K. is a Marxist Islamic organization created by children of college educated Iranian merchants in the 60s this day to Burma said, the group presented the infiltration of Western culture during my hemorrhage as Shah Palavi's reign. Remember him? No. Niyadam neither. Remember the Shah though? Sure. Oh, that was the Shah. That was the Shah of Iran. I said. I didn't realize he had all the other names like a spick. Oh, yeah. M.K. Support of the 79 take over the US Embassy in Terran in the fundamentals revolution that over through the Shah, the Shah of Iran who is our guy with his sub-vac, what he used to torture guys and pull their fingernails out to get the truth.

It's been a wild show today. I don't know why, but it's just me or why. No, the technical difficulties were half of it. That's what makes it a little better. Is everything as I'll scoot up? The audience likes it better. We actually kind of a perverse, a mass acoustic way we enjoy. Tomorrow I'm going to pull through random wires before it's shut. Speaking of massacism, in fact, when you were coming in the morning, wait to hear me, you know what you're going to hear? What? Oh, that. This sounds a silence. Or if we do want to be a nice guy and I just don't show up, you'll just have to find out. Maybe I'll just leave the audio on from me. From Playboy Channel. What's your dance to it? I'm always so nervous about putting that on because we don't want to get Michael Powell all upset. We don't want to get his big fact rective in an upper rack. Oh no. Idiot. Smuck. I wonder if he ever has wild diarrhea. You know, stop thinking about that. It doesn't. You think the chairman of the FCC somebody's upstanding is Colin Powell's son. The upper righteous chairman of the Federal Communications Commission ever has a wild body diarrhea because they're so obsessed with excursory activity. And all of these things, okay? Man, how much is Farts Mill? 10 times worse than mine. And that's saying a lot. That is saying a lot. Hey, don't forget join Kim Bo Kamper. Now there is a guy.

Not even close yesterday was 10. We were right out of the idea either to a clock. I think now that they know that we got the flush on the site. You're going to see that number growing daily. Yeah. We're going to see something growing. You got maybe right the hour. Maybe several times a day. But not just that. But I mean, when we put that second thing on there about the Democrats who slogan. Yeah. I'm going to put that on poster. I think that really gave a whole new altitude on the whole thing. They were Russian. They were like stealing computers.

There was due to a CC's thrown all over the walls, the floor, the ceiling, and the stunts so bad. I heard they broke off what's left here knows! It's been swollen. It's heard of me very badly. I've been pain all the time. Tonight on E. Oh, Michael, it's still in love with children. I want to say sorry. What are you going to do with some kid shows up at your front door one day? You'll see. One, Michael, you can tell me. Throw off the knife. One, 56 at 5, 60 WQ, and we got the mad dog sitting by. The bull and the bust, I should read the entire, it's pretty short. Because most people were listening to the beginning of the show. From this morning's national post, they staugy right-wing newspaper here in Toronto. An editorial no less. It says some football fans expected the Carolina Panthers to win some of their superbowl. Others correctly predicted victory for the New England Patriots. Very few in Ena Category would have predicted they'd see Janet Jackson's bare breast appear on their TV screens, but thanks to a weird stunt in which Justin Tinkerbell ripped away piece of his fellow pop singers out for during the big games, traditionally Garrison and Dan's half-time extravaganza, they did. According to Michael Powell, the US Federal Communications Commission Chairman, children, parents and citizens deserve better than this classless, crash and deplorable stunt. Take a deep breath, Mr. Powell. Whether the incident was civil war drill malfunction as Mr. Tinkerbell claimed, and ever by Ms. Jackson promote her upcoming album or a bid to prove that she was not in fact her brother Michael, it's hard to imagine that a fleeting image of a plastic surgeon's handy work will be what corrupts America. Real football fans had fact had no doubt forgotten Ms. Jackson seemingly inadvertent striptees by the time the game ended. courtesy of what was arguably the most upsetting fourth quarter in Superbowl history. For weeks commented as pretty as they snorfe as between two largely anonymous squads, looking for a storyline even suggested that Superbowl 38 was signaled on of a new boring football or in which defense's large league perity and conservative coaching stuffed out exciting playmaking. We can forget all of that now as these Superbowl reminded us on Sunday, the NFL still serves up some of the finest drama entertainment in sports. Mr. Powell has ordered an investigation of the CBS broadcast, but this overwrought proved aside, we suspect the majority of America's hand-wringers have already moved on. Hundreds of millions of fans went home or stayed home happy on Sunday night. Most remember the game's great plays vividly long after Janet Jackson's breast becomes the answer to it unusually obscure question in some future edition of trivial pursuit. How do you like that? I like the life. I love it. Even a staggy right wing rag like the National Post Day. We get way over 1000 votes on here like I said if we don't get 25,000 votes in the next 37. What's your take on Boogate? Justin and Janet have to Superbowl. They're still talking about it. They're still looking at it. They're still whipping that thing back and forth and up and down all around the place. A thousand and forty-seven votes, five hundred and thirty-nine said, grow up America, you boobs, you lunatics, you repressed pathetic tragic people who are popping at Seattle City flagra and other stuff. What's the other one? Niagara. Niagara. Niagara. Niagara. Falls. L.C. poppeted falls. Fifty-one-and-a-half percent said grow up already, William. It was totally contrived. I loved it. 164. I loved it. When can I see more? 137. But I don't have much sight. It was totally contrived. I hated it. 112. Yeah, politics and perversion. It took us all these years. We've finally got the formula. A politics and perversion. It's the PP show. Wait till we have Tom Brady's penis on there tomorrow. Doing, it will penetrate. It was the puppetry of Tom Brady's penis. It was shameful. The FCC should stick it to him. 64 or 6.1 percent. Let it have it, Michael. With both barrels, baby. I think it really wasn't actually. 18 silly people said that. Nobody's that stupid. I forgot about our crowd. That's right. Those are the same people that show up at those appearances. And I haven't seen it 13 haven't seen it. How could you possibly not see it? The only people that couldn't see it are like blind mic or people with no TV set. People with TV's have been repoed, something like that. Well, that's going to do it. Thanks to our fantastic engineering staff for making sure that everything was screwed up to the noon. Because I think that's really what made it to the made today today. And it, oh yeah, it made it hell. And it was a big surprise for you. It was a picnic for me. In fact, even the ants showed up on time. Anyway, the mad dog is standing by. He's coming along next to you. Got no hump or today because bull is out there at the David Pusters. And don't forget the Panther game. Panthers at San Jose tonight 10 30. Any interest at all. Bye. Bye. The weather is cold. I'm plastic. I'm going to be clear. I'm going to be 40. I've got two sets of lifts. Just lick them.
