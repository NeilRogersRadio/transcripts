What are you doing open out? I'd like to show so far what are you saying? I'm listening. That's all accounts, okay as long as he's listening, I'm happy. You know what I'm talking about? I want from Boca. That's the guy. Boy, it's a good thing we got these parts sounds out here. Look at all the good stuff we got on here now. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was bad anyway. What? All those parts. Yeah, that was bad stuff. We didn't want to play farting sounds, do we? Yeah. Oh. Anyway, we got this bad news speaking of bad. The get started. They be sad. We apologize. We've been off the air for about 40 minutes. What time they go off, Tena? Some like that. Yeah. That's because you're living in a tropical soar is where you're living. You're living in a nightmare. Well, I'm going to leave her with ice. It's paradise, isn't it? Paradise? I'm listening. I'm tired, Mo. I saw him. I looked into the window this morning and wave. He didn't do the wave. Oh, it's thinking to do in the wave. I hate to break the news to you. Idiots out there. But the wave went out with knickers. Just because they're giving away a bunch of free crap out there. You know, stupid little rings, you know, those make believe rings. Oh, no, we got to actually and do the wave. Oh, brother. America is looking at you and saying, what a bunch of, where is, oh, I didn't have the bleep on here. Is it on here? That thing, yeah. Oh, this is weird sounding. Is it? Well, this happens every Monday when I come back to town, which is why I don't come on back very often. The first day is always in disaster. It sounds really tinny. Then it again. Again. It does. Really tinny and funky and weird. The TV is all screwed up because everything blew out here on Friday because it was storming and lightning and thundering in the end of the world. Where's the bleep? OK. No, no, no. There it is. So when I was saying this America is watching and I said, what a bunch of bleeping idiots down there doing the wave. They didn't get the word, the message that that went out a little early years ago. OK, let's get to death count out of the way here at the beginning of the show like we do every day since nobody seems to care very much. Three US Marines have been killed in fighting West to Baghdad, bringing the total number of US troops killed since Friday to 23. This sounds awful. This sounds like I'm talking to a tin can. Did somebody did it with this mic and he did Zack do it on Friday? I think exactly. By the way, that shows Zack. Zack is a rubber people are playing in house one hell of a rock show man. It was just going nuts for less 45 minutes. Probably had a bigger audience than we got right now. Anyway, and to kind of put in better perspective, gunfire was largely silence today. In the second day of a truce in Fallujah where Rocky doctors said 600 people, including many civilians were killed top US military spokesman said about 70 Americans and 700 insurgents have been killed since April 1. I thought it was a little over year ago. The war was over. Missed a little. Missed a little. We had a cop was all done right. And he was out there running at the aircraft carrier. All dressed up in a zoo suit. I mean, you people have blood on your hands. I want to say that again, all you bush people even Miguel was just in the doorway there. Don't let him vote by the way. Remember, keep mockupied. Hang in the vote for Bush says who he's going to vote for carry. Keep better. Miguel Escobar, professional Kubano, come on east of coming east is going to vote for John carry. That's carry. Wow. I'd rather vote for you. I'd rather vote for you. Then Bush. Yeah, you got my vote, ma. Let me tell you. I'm listening. I might as well use those a lot to run there. So when we apologize for the day of the year, but of course on a sports station, sometimes it's a public service. Well, I'm bitter man. I'm really bitter about being back here more so than ever before. And, oh, and now look at this. Shut up. How many already did that thing? Let's still make an noise back there. Everything here is a piece of crap. Okay. We apologize for the bad weather to our brothers from up north just to make everybody misery loves company. Right? That's our motto. What has been beautiful up until. Right? It's a long time. Yeah. It was pretty nice. Right? But I wanted to look weak. You know, by the way, something. Yeah. We have classical music in the background for some unknown reason. We have classical music in the background now. Of us. Yeah. Audio intellectuals out there. Hallelujah, baby. Maybe we can have a real movement, which movement we're going to have. So that's what we used to play. Not that movement. We don't want to get in the troll. Okay. Let's do the break because the good news is we got a few spots today. Not too many just enough. Maybe we're making a way. If we don't have enough money to get new TV, we're going to have another one of those full new options for you. I'm five six two. So you can wait at my own for learning. WKT Miami Beach Miami. Stay tuned for the Irbshinder Show. What's your least bellabigh? Oh, it's the Jewish station. I mean the Haitian station. I mean the classical station. But in an old by cheap channel anyway. That's something. Greg H. Good. Yeah. He went on vacation this week. He found out I was coming back. He can't face me. He had to leave. He had to bail out. Line's sack of crap. Oh, what about put the Howard Sturdon that you're holding? Yeah. That's a good idea, Greg. So we never got any spots on, right? No, no, no. Whatever you can start. We never got to that point. Uh. Now we definitely going to have to do another online option. Just one. We're going to have to do another online option. We're going to have to do another online option. Yeah. Oh, yeah. The musk rat. Right. We got to see a lot of the pan. Can you imagine a panther of picture there? And they're plaque? Get 5000 for that. The sales department picture. That's worth 50 grand easy. Sure. You got all those hockey plaques. Those bronzes up there. That box of peckeroni. We just can't say what it is. Just with his ear glued. Waiting for me to start talking. He just can't miss a word. So even when we're off the areas list them. Hope we enjoyed the classical music that's bleed over from K. A. T. W. K. A. T. My me beats Miami. Not. That brings back bad memories. We got better music. Catch the cat to my passion. Disc over here. Just in case we go on the passion of the Jesus. He is risen by the way. You know that. Oh, no. They go into my neighborhood and see one of my neighbors has got a big flag. And further house says he is risen. Keep your bummer. My sis in your hours. Super stick to yourself. Please like a fine dough. He is risen. Right. In fact, maybe we can use Jesus as a pizza crust. At the law. That's something to think about. Not drink. It is. It's over by now. I would think. Although we probably still have some less of our pace. It. He can't. It's past. So what do we want to do? We just want to. We just want to. I don't care. I don't care. I mean, this is. I don't. I don't come here. It's because this place is a joke. Poor fix it's out there. Try to buy a new TV. So if the world comes when we can actually put it on the ear. Anybody want to hear CNN? You're listening to it. You can pop it up in there. Yeah, except I got Jerry on. Oh, and you don't want to put anymore that golf crap. Okay. Let's give you the results for me. I stay from the weekend pool. Okay. Do I have them? I got him here somewhere. Well, which one of us is the most obnoxious? I think it's pretty obnoxious to the audience. You know, you should have probably changed your vote. Georgia's brother passed away on Monday of last week. And Georgia's whole vacation was spent with few animals and the pressure and all of terrible stuff. It was only how well it's 43. 43. And it's a birthday Saturday. He'll be 40. No, it will not be a birthday. It would have been. It wouldn't have been. Yeah, but now he's dead. So anyway, he was fat. He smoked a lot. And it's really sad. I think it was a good guy. And the good people, of course, are the dead people. It's done. But we said. And all these people say you're obnoxious. So I think you know, ball him. Based on what you know and hear. And of course, they all know so much. Don't they? Who do you pick is the most obnoxious in WCM? Now, they didn't get this one right. Our from Bokeh. He won by a landslide. This is out of 20, 270 votes. He got almost a thousand votes. Nice going, Mo. I'm listening. All right. Almost a thousand votes. What is Clarence talking to you in there? Okay. Spots. Forget about the spot. Leave that to screw in. I know she's not here today. So just forget about it. By the way, Greg's not here either. They because. Right. Right. Now, he sent you his condolences when your brother passed away. Great. No. Clarence? No. Today. He can. He can. You need to. I can do it. That's late. I can do it. Thank you. I'll do you never call me. You should have called. Just. I'm still in. I think I'm more in shock than you are. That's possible. That's the. The fact that that's the scariest. Oh, like my misery. Who's that? All the fat people that you know have this habit of dying. Yeah. That's funny that way. That's three now. Right. That we got me. And that was the track said. Wait till you're my tracks. Do I folks. You love this. But before we get to that. They're just show-look at him in the food is coming out of the corner. No, I'm not exaggerating. I was getting easily nauseous watching him eat as the food was oozing out of the corners of his mouth Which is a shame because he's still not as fat as he was right now. He's he's lost about four or five hundred Pounds since his I would say senty maxed out since his peak right since he was dragging at bag around or whatever that was But no, and then my friend Derek who was always skinny skinny as a rail who comes to the track with us for many many years He's got a big pupic now. He's fat So the fact is he's just Out of control and of course in my house now that I'm home a few days Oh, there's Easter eggs over here and there's candy over here in his cookies Christmas cookies. It's Easter It's a wrong holiday, but Christmas cookies with a little red and green sprinkles on it Just to make sure that I can get died before I get a chance to get out of here Anyway, here's the poll result the most obnoxious person that you am according to our audience How are David at 943 absolutely boy the homper which surprised me the Hebrew hammer 329 pretty strong second for the hammer George 151.

Oh, I see and I see at a back of the car this bitch is not only got a The fish with the gee the word Jesus inside of just in case you don't know. She also has a bumper stick Speak to that last bit. I played I pledge allegiance or something one nation under God with the other guy and other words I'm gonna show you Can't say that either. No, oh, we can't say anything But at any rate, so I'm thinking of myself. What why are you doing this? I'm always talking about religion as a weapon And there's a good example of it keep it to yourself. I don't care what you believe more power to you Okay, I'll be able to have a wonderful time and purgatory wherever you're going But I just don't want to be bothered with it then I come home and I had left a couple of things interridered and bring a few toiletry things back I'm gonna say one beginning with a d. I don't think we can say that anymore Yeah, well, no wait a minute. Why can't you say that? I don't know I See them in the store all the time and no, no, you can say douche. Why not? I mean if you can say Yeah, but that's supposed to I know that's what they do with the container that you buy it right But anyway, so I go to the early I was gonna go into Walgreens that 24 hour one by me there And I drive by there and I there's not a parking space to be found this is 1130 Saturday night And I thought how can this be? Are they given merchandise away or something? And so I just cruise to about I look inside the window And I see them all lined up at the cashier. I mean a long line because they're buying Christmas candy Yes, today morning. I get up. I sleep in a little bit get up to go out to get my Sunday newspapers by the way the great thing about Sunday newspapers is you can throw away within five minutes They're about both they hurt on the Sun settle about 15 pounds of ads that's all that's in their ads and special sections and crap There's nothing to read So I go out there get my newspapers and I look up and I see I don't want to say which house, but it's pretty obvious in my neighborhood One of my neighbors which I mentioned before is got a big flag, okay? That says He is risen. Of course. This is Easter Sunday morning. You understand Although this is Easter Monday now and Britain and the flag I see is still there But anyway, I'm thinking of myself. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this now? The building I live in in Toronto for example which is a very big apartment building They put out a notice every year at about the beginning of December about the building rules On the door decorations all of these things. They're just prohibited No crosses no Star David no What's the other thing you put on the door Christmas the Reath? No, not all of these things. They're prohibited No, Mr. They're they're explained that it's just they know it's offensive to some people and I can't offend anybody just have a little bit Uh, and that's all very simple America little decorum have a little bit of consideration for other people and stop trying to beat that Wow, I don't care what you believe. I don't need to know it. Yeah, you do. No, I don't I don't need I don't know I don't want people are always complaining about you and I about the shows We do what religion we talk about that too much. We'd never do any shows Religion if nobody else would talk about it They just believe they're own furry tales and stop killing each other because of it and leave us alone leave us alone No, I don't want to be dragged down the path to purgatory We're gonna go and I don't care. I don't want it. I don't want to know about it. You'll think me later. She is risen. I talk to myself What a what a nasty thing. Okay, no seriously. It's just nasty It's back when you know right after 9.00 and a lot of us including me We got sucked into the thing putting the American flags on for right now I think you'd have to be embarrassed all the why saw a couple of cars over the weekend and they got the little flag the window flag on there again on a car Oh, now that you're back here. They got some four flag jobbies But you know something I sure hope they got some ketchup to put on there to simulate blood Because if you're one of those people man if you're supporting this insanity You've got blood on your hands and blood on your flag Make no mistake about it. It's a disgrace what's going on and the public is little bit like this Pretty soon it'll be 800 then it'll be 900 then there'll be a thousand people coming home and body bags Plus the thousands who are mailed and you related might as well be dead Plus of course the thousands of those people over there I don't know this in the beginning. It's called a man's of patient by the competition You're free now we're gonna care you you can't be much freer than that right got nothing to worry about no bills to pay your dead Speaking of for your own good right for your own good. There you just shut up and take it How's that pull coming boy? This guy was right on a religion thing man? Got 10 immediately That's our crowd. That's our good. He even crowd you can knock her audience or you want we got plenty of goofballs out there We got a crowd man. It's heads and shoulders above the rest including those barbarians at the track Saturday, which I will eventually get in that straight a minute one minute That that told me right there where I was there is no there is no place else on the face of the earth Even in the Bronx even Manhattan on a bad day that could have been on Saturday night and seen what I saw a display of barbarians of lunatics so grotesque Anyway, which of these you care about the least that's our pull course that ain't the arrogues dot com 136 votes Goal 52 alright. Let's say All right 52 it is pathetic and like you said It's one thing if you want to play to go out get some exercise Socialize moves a little bit a couple of beers. Well, I mean whatever just a lot and smooth a little because you got nothing else here But to sit and watch other people play golf you have to be an imbicill man You have to be a moron No, no, don't you slower it would be a still picture on your team. I mean I can understand a lifeless lifeless old turds who just are like walking vegetables I can like for example hour from broke there's one You know I can understand him getting involved in that that's all he talks about Goal 52 hockey 25 shame on you leaves two out of one nothing Saturday pretty lame game by the way game 3 tonight How about Nashville how about this predator?

That's fine because that kind of celebration is like generic it It's just for fun and holidays the Halloween with the punk that's right It's not jamming somebody's superstition believes down your throat It's not like standing on top of your roof with a megafaune on he has risen Jesus I don't care okay. You're gonna see this Yoshiki. All right, I'm not interested You're gonna realize that Jesus has risen and you're gonna go over there and not come to door and ask them to share Jesus with you I'm gonna save you that's why I'm absolutely not going on in their hands I'm gonna say you know that flag you got sitting out in front of that I'm tired of looking at well somebody Just like my next door neighbor told me about the sign that was sitting on the side of the house that you couldn't see this one's right out there in front I don't want to see it I don't want to see it see I mean and also a Christmas time it's your property You can go ahead and put that you know the the manger and a hold you know the other people I do that the big religious display out there. I find that offensive I know people We all know people Your people yeah all of them I intend for a minute. Oh my goodness. How can you say these terrible things especially at this time of year really easy any other Time of year is no difference. Bonish time of hallala your Z I'm also one of my favorite moments of my life. I was just thinking during that break Was when a door opened a little while ago and Clarence stood in there breathlessly to announce that we had no delay working right now and I said No calls and he put me like like a little light bulb or see me go Yeah, what's that thing or were you got that? I got it in there. No rise bell or something whatever it is Very good, Clarence. You're really catching on baby. I said another 15 20 years work a little abotum You remove all that sports crab from part of your brain whatever is supposed to be in there and you might actually be a blood cast I'm not too sure I doubt it, but keep working on it Points in me like oh very good nail very good. No calls So those people like Miguel that were giving me crap about seven months I didn't know cause it was a good practice for days like this Well, we have technical problems when it's pouring its gray as black outside It's lightning and thundering. It's typical soft food and this is only the 12th April by the way 12th of April And already we got these storms. This wait till the summer. I read a story that I wouldn't dare read it on the air because our fragile Emotion audience would have an interest breakdown about Arctic about global warming. Oh, that did you see that start that's an environmentalist plot And the crux of this story is a good start. We really happened in big time by 2010 and I'm thinking of myself That's only six years away You know when you get to be 90 which I think is old enough by the way when you get to be 90 almost 91 Which I think is very old and then you don't worry about stuff is gonna happen seven years down right You're saying by the year 2800. Well, we're not gonna be here by the year 2000. You're not looking right inside What's that look at all these wonderful dive sites that they're gonna have for the divers now former city of Miami Yeah, you're not dying here already You're like the now look at this look at this car. So this is cute It says Title as golf ball. It's got it's got a TV screen with a big picture of a golf ball with the number seven on it And in this instance, there's the hole and the flag and the sun shining to back says Title as golf ball five dollars 60 inch flat panel plasma HD TV 17 thousand dollars the schmuck was amazed by actually seeing the number on the ball Priceless That's cute That is really cute. Oh, I could I could see the number on the ball on the HD TV Get a life you idiot you lifeless and you lifeless cool Why I forgot all about how silly it was you know what during my vacation I was I did it now got all about the sweetness of our life. I got dumped by Josh court. It's like right rightly so I said bag the idea of word. Yeah No, now you know you can you can say scum like if you talk about wiping the scum off the bottom of the ship or something But you can't say Man name the container that you put the scum into when you're done Watch it just don't start the dancing around the edges too much here Which of these you care about the least if you're wondering why I'm not taking any calls because we need the license.

meat too and I get to write a six o'clock bad move on my part okay why is it a bad move because that's right when they're opening up and letting the they have this gigantic group of old yentas there oh my way Toby I'm so sorry for you Toby Toby is a very nice lady she sells the programs at pompot o park all right poorly and she and her husband they schlep out all of the stuff and she has to and of course they're all a decenting upon her so they had some kind of a special deal I guess where the people had coupons for a free program oh god a free program what are they normally like a buck 250 oh my god 250 big bucks there must have been in this group a hundred people you have never in your life you would have thought that Toby was standing there with a stack of thousand dollar bills and that the first 20 people who were able to shove and push and squeeze through each other we're gonna get those 20s and she's saying I really it's a good thing she didn't have a gun because I think she'd have committed suicide or maybe shout some of them I have never seen such a barbaric display and I thought to myself now you know where you are now you know exactly why people hate this place and the people who make this the toilet that it is and outdoor nursing home that's what this is we're even the young people can't have a good time we don't want them here they're making too much noise having too good of a time and she says if you won't form a single line nobody's gonna get any programs because she's trying to create I mean she's got really you know she's standing behind the counter they're trying to create a little bit of order out of this mess this chaos this chaotic scene the races don't start till 705 it's not like they're gonna go running up there and start plunging their guts out with their $2 show bets I don't think and they are pushing and shoving and adjutating well how come and I'm standing off to the side because I get my programs for free how do you like that without any coupon because I'm a hot shot I practically am an employee there at Pompidol Park for almost 30 years now how many bought thirty man yeah and so one bitch but how about him he's not in line I wanted to go over just punch her right in the head I really did I wanted to just go and just give her a knuckle sandwich all the rage now miserable bitch miserable old-style and the scene was just I just walked away there I couldn't I couldn't wait to get on the elevator just to get away from these people in fact there are like three elevators going up stairs so I made sure I went to the one on the in where nobody was like sure and I real quick got in and depressed the button got to hell away from those people I used the word people loosely you're not people you're barbarians okay you know who I'm talking about you know the crowd up there at win more where were these people came from your lunatics your maniacs you need to be uh I don't know why you need to be put away somewhere in a rubber room and keep the public safe from you and all your behavior your barbaric protests subhuman behavior you know what I'm saying oh yeah that too now here's the facts that kind of like is right in line with that it says if you thought to deal it the track was bad that was the deal you should have been at the marlins game on Saturday people ran to arrive they were getting ready to ride because they didn't get the marlins replica ring they were lining up to fill out forms so they could have one sent to them because they paid and never got it I went to the game but didn't really care

just again tells me where i am ignomestic about it jethi lake works as you the only person who i've heard talk about a possible strike for the next hockey season I called the Panther organization to try to get some information on the strike before I renew my tickets for next year and they wouldn't comment. Of course they wouldn't comment. They watch your money Why then he says why do you think there's gonna be a strike and why do we call friends Canadians frogs? I hate it. Why do we call them frogs because that's what they sound like probably will be like that Started with the French. There you go But in any way, why do I think there's gonna be a strike while I think if you talk to a hundred people and I think about hockey 98 would tell you there's almost definitely gonna be a lockout not a strike The preseason will go on because the players only get played a payday per dendering and preseason not their salary But what's the season supposed to start? It's gonna be by by Because the collective bargaining agreement expired after this season when the playoffs are over in a couple of weeks in June whenever it's gonna be That's the answer Jeff. The Panther organization doesn't want you to think there's gonna be next season because then you won't Give them their money just like they were sending out several weeks ago Oh, we need to many many weeks ago. We need you to posit on your money for the playoff. Okay, right Even George knows the Panthers ain't making no playoffs They aren't in no playoffs even George knows that. I was able to get some really good seats for people Seats for what for the hockey games such as they were here recently. Oh, I see oh, of course 124 people say they care least about golf. Oh, yes, I think golf needs to be banned Instead of banning books and words and all these things. Let's ban golf Don't you think what beautiful parks they would I would like to start a movement? I'm not talking about that kind of Well, I'm not about it. Where we just ban golf Keep people off the golf course given something constructive to do and stop wasting your time out there Wackin at ball around okay you idiot you embezzles you man you know what I'm saying Absolutely there you go even he agrees Open up the courses to a dirt bikers there'd be good dirt bag.

Mm-hmm How the FCC are our padding themselves in each other on our back now for this late is half a million dollar fine on clear channel They're all excited about it and Michael cops said this and John Aitalstein said that All five of them they're all a bunch of rabbit Nazis is what they are The word police we can't play that anymore either because he's a scam in there So when I said in the beginning like 60 or 70% of the stuff that we were gonna lose because we can't say anything anymore And then of course time jickenness quoted me in the paper and I just go on Tommy but at any right now it's like 90% right Just based on one thing or another Silly crap the number of days I'm sitting up there and I'm all dish I'm listening to something on cue during the break to just to make sure and then I mean just so innocuously one of those words will come in like Damn or what are and I can't play it And we don't even have the Explorated version of Bill cigars down here.

It meant a lot more customers for the 99 95 ornaments six statues have sold in the past couple of weeks alone and the attempted roadside Model C stopping traffic He wanted a stop when he saw the naked women in the bikinis Joan Philpots that ever husband a 50 years bill and yes some customers are peaking They're peaking They're pulling the tops and looking underneath said G L co on or Angie Lane for they wonder what we're hiding What's under there can it be felt?

My religion's better than yours, religion. My religion's better than yours. We don't want the news or things where my Muslim is overrated by religion better than yours. Well, 16 at 5.60 WQM happy Monday today. I'm going to read, oh, don't do that. Well, I got a couple things here to read. You know, the great book by Richard Clark against all enemies is a good, because you just started it when I went to the page. It is sensational. I'm still not done. Almost done. I read four pages of it on here. I think it was the last week so we're not around. Damn it. Could you do it by me? No. But I'm going to read the last page in a half. Just a page in a half. And of course that'll spoil the ending. No, it's not that kind of a book. I don't think. Now you want to listen to this Richard Clark. He's the best. He's great. He ain't no con bellisa. He says September 11th had erased memories of the unique process where by George Bush had been selected as president a few months earlier. Now as he stood with an arm around a New York farm and promising to get those with destroyed the world trade center, he was every America's president. His pole sword, he had a unique opportunity to unite America to bring the West together with allies around the world to fight terrorism and hate to eliminate Al Qaeda to eliminate ourholder abilities. Just rightly important nation threatened by radicalism. He did none of those things he invaded Iraq. There were no longer any excuses after 9.11 for failing to eliminate the threat posed by Al Qaeda and its clones for failing to reduce America's vulnerabilities to attack. Instead of addressing that threat with all the necessary attention required, we went off on a tangent off after Iraq, off on a path that weakness and strength of next generation of Al Qaeda's. Freedom is that we've been attrating the core Al Qaeda organization of his metastasized, it was like a hydrogrowing new heads. There've been far more major terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda and its regional clones than the 30 months it's 9.11 than the war in the 30 months prior to that moment to prevent. I wonder if Bin Laden has deputies actually planned for 9.11 to be like smashing a pot of seeds that spread around the world lying in the expect step back out of the picture and have the regional organizations he created take their generation long struggle to the next level. President Bush asked us soon after 9.11 for cards or charts of the senior Al Qaeda managers as though dealing with them would be like a Harvard business school exercise in a hostile takeover. He announced his intentions to measure progress in the war on terrorism by crossing through the pictures of those caught or killed. I have a disturbing image of him sitting by a war-might house fireplace drawing a dozen red excess on the faces of the former Al Qaeda corporate board and soon perhaps on a sum of Bin Laden. While the new clones of Al Qaeda working the back alleys in dark war ends of Baghdad, Cairo Jakarta, Karachi Detroit and Newark, using the scenes from Iraq to stroke the hatred of Merke even further, including thousands whose names we will never know whose faces will never be on President Bush's little charts not until it's again too late. The nation needed thoughtful leadership to deal with the underlying problems 9.11 reflected, a radical deviant Islamist ideology on the rise, real security vulnerabilities in the highly integrated global civilization, instead America got unthinking reactions, ham-handed responses, and a rejection of analysis in favor of received wisdom. It is leftless less secure and will pay the price for a long time. Well, said Richard Clark, you go dick, I Richard. I'm going. Him for President. Right. Amen. Well, they've smeared him so much now. That's the reason when they took that poll after Condolize. Who do you believe more, Condolize or that the Clark guy? Yeah. The one that we just spent a whole week and a half telling you what a fakeery is about how he beats his dog and he's a scum. Yeah. Well, you can do either syllable, I'm making the right. No, no. Yeah. I had to be careful because I don't want to dump myself again. You got to pick up that book, folks, against the enemies by Richard Clark, if you want to, what's really going on? And must be just a coincidence, he's a registered Republican and Paul O'Neill, who's also Republican, a former Secretary of Treasury and WW. It must be just a coincidence, they're saying all these things. This one also is a full-consolvable book. Yeah, I just want to pedal a few books. Now, on the other hand, if David from wants to sell a book, you know, that great right-wing sell-out speech writer, that's a different story. He's just doing it to save mankind, sure everybody would have great cobbushes. Great. David from, all I can say about you is, I'm sure, Lopad Miss Drudge, okay, David? Very sad. You know, David from, from where? Hunger? Beat you to it. Oh, here's a good guy John McCain on the talk of Run with Kerry. The headline says, no. No. And no. Yeah, see? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Tried to stamp out speculation that he might consider joining Democratic Senator John Kerry's ticket. Republican Senator John McCain to Arizona insisted Sunday that he would not do so under any circumstances. He said it would campaign in vote for President Bush and the fall, despite their policy differences, despite the fact that Bush is an Nazi. He says, no, no, I know I will not leave the Republican Party. Our charity ideals and principles of Abraham Lincoln theater Roosevelt Ronald Reagan Heinrich Kimler. He said it and be sees me depressed. I will not be the vice president of the U.S. under any circumstances. I feel that I can be far more effective in helping shape policy in the future this country as a U.S. senator. He's just a law for reason to quiver kid or, you know, they're all the same. The old one. It's got a big pair of man. It's Ted. Good old petty. Huh? I said that's right. He's got a ragged old pair of man, but he's got a big pair. And he's, they don't take any crap from anybody. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line, which of these do you think? Do you care about most? 433 votes. How's that possible? Least. What do I say? Most. Most least? Which of the easier care about most least? Less than anything else. Golf 142, but religion's catching up 881. Why just done that maybe because golf is a religion? Absolutely. Correct sir. Absolutely. Yeah. Golf 142, religion 88, Howard Stern 76, care about him at least. Hockey 71. Ain't going to be no season next year. Don't pay those tickets. Oh, why did? That's because I get reimbursed. Stock market 25, the Marlins 24, politics 5 and sex only a two. I'm other in the next door neighbor. No, my mother in your mother. Yeah. Well, I don't know about your mother. She hired stories. Oh no. I don't think we want to go here. Go here. They're ancient stories anyway. Here's a medley of our call. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. Good to talk to you. I was just listening to your discussion on the Richard Clark book. Right. And I say, what's not forget the Kevin Phillips book. He's also a long time ago. I've got to put, I haven't, you're right. I haven't read it yet, but you're another long time Republican. I've read it and it's an interesting book, but it's kind of dry. Oh yeah. But it's what he's kind of dry. You know, he is. But it's, the more I read it, I was gripping the book so hard out of. I'm just squeezing a blunt out of it. I cannot believe the country put, never this disguise yours, the whole family is involved in nothing but conspiracy and intelligence. Well, that book, the House of the Souther, where it shows the picture of W and Van der Bush holding hand. I mean, Van, Prince Van der Holding each other's hands on a front. And me, it raises a lot of questions. You're all I'm saying. Just the picture does. Exactly. Where they hold hands for, where they got going there. And I agree with you, you know, everybody complains about these books, but David from and all these other. Right. We all go ahead. Yeah. Can write and say whatever they want. And it's great. Obviously, I guess we're a woman because I guess George Bush is the greatest American that has ever lived since George Washington. Evidently. And by George. How can we, he's building a better America, him and Jesus? And by the way, speaking of Jesus, he has risen, you know? I heard that. Oh, a macro. But instead of going, I went to the movie, just I have a movie for you. Yeah. It's called Osama. And it's a little asking a movie from Afghanistan and show you how the Islam had such a grip on these people. Mm-hmm. I think it's coming out on DVD, but I just saw it in the movies. Yeah. Let me just get this question. How come before an 911? We liked them so much. And we give them that $43 million that nobody talks about any more to stop growing in poppies. Which they're by the way doing again. In fact, now they're not only growing them again, but the heroin trade, there is bigger than ever. And the warlords are back in charge big time. I just mentioned that in passing in Afghanistan. Well, the friend, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Is that it? I guess the next step. And a Taliban are reorganizing. I should also mention that Afghanistan. I just mentioned that in passing. The Taliban are reorganizing. Well, once he's through what Iraq is going to go back to Afghanistan, it's finished that off. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're going to go to Iran. That's quite a good. In fact, speaking of Iran, I'm reading a book now about the overthrow of a democratic elected government. And Iran, which put the Shah back in power. Right. It's correct. He was our bad guy and the point of the book is that we saw that. We saw the sea as well as terrorists. No question about it. And no one wants to hear it if you say it. I'm going to tell you right now, my friend, in the 70s, I said this on Friday, I'll say it again. We should have gone into Saudi Arabia when they jacked the price of oil up when they quadrupled it overnight. We should have gone in there. I'll be when they had a fire single shot because they're a bunch of cowards, Spimus cowards anyway. Just take it over to country and stuck our own regime in there. Put in our troops, take it over to Worldfield. You can be pumping gas right now for 25 cents a gallon. But what would Prince Bandar say? Not much, not anymore. And I rest my case. Thank you. Good talking to you now. See you. I'll tell you what Prince Bandar and all those other great robbers would say what those are sheets they were. Bye bye. What they'd say? Real fast. Oh, you want to come in here? Okay, no problem at all. Yeah, bunch of Spimulus cowards, man. The bushes and the bin Laden's and Prince Bandar. Wow. Did one bit and we can actually still play it. I can't believe it. I hope it's in here. Oh, it's not in here. Oh, no. Until we blow a Pakistan. It's not in there. It's got to be. I'll bet your Greg's life on it right now. It's not in here. No. It's not. Huh? Until we blow a Pakistan. That's the name of the bid. It's in my DCS up there because I put it in there. I'm like this crap we got down here. Which everything I look for is in here. Is it there? Is it anywhere? No. It's an ACN. It's old. We have the, I'll find it. I'll find it in the break. I'll show you. I'll show you what for. But anyway, I've all the things that I played. That's one. That's the truth. We went to war if we're going to go to war against anybody, which we should have been using all opinions and dollars to fight to for homeland security and to go get the real terrorists. As opposed to Queen of all this terrorist activity in a country where it was going on my first place. But we should have got Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Those were the two. Even a child knows that. Am I right? Absolutely. And third on the list would be Iran and fourth North Korea. Iraq and even the top five. They aren't even bubbling under. That's what Dick Clark says. And he knows his American bandstand, baby. He knows his hits. 27 past. I saw Tommy this morning. He knows his hits. 27 past. No. 5. 60 WQM. It's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

My god. Return to Scotland. Here, Carol. Prof. 3426, to one we've got to Mad Dog at 2. The Humper from Shula State 2 in Miami Lakes and 4 in Icecoin, Hank. That one. He knows to stay there. How lot of this place? Oh, not bad enough. We had 23 American kids die over the weekend last three days. But now the army says 7 employees of US firm are missing in Iraq. Oh, 7 employees of the American construction and engineering company, Kellogg Brown and Root, which is Halleberton of course. Our unaccounted for an Iraq, the top US general said today. We have 7 KBR employees unaccounted for us and Ricardo Sanchez. He also said 2 US troops were out of counter for it. No for the details about the troops or the missing employees. So there are people not just kind of like vanishing. Tooth it. Yeah. Did you see during all of your grief last week, did you see that the tape of the Japanese protest? No, the hostage is the pan. Oh, with the night's held of their throat. It was not good. That fun stuff. This a lot of good stuff apparently. Well, 5 6 7. I just mentioned these things in passion because they realized we got bigger and more important things to do. I'm worried about like, what's his name? Phil Nicholson one of the masters. He put the green jacket on and everyone went. Oh, yeah, I saw it on my ATT. He said I even got to see close up on him balls. Can we say that? It's so sad. Well, that's sad. I'm listening. I use to a mall. tragic. You would all your blue nose. Cool friends. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the ATT and T and for rise of wireless line. Let's get these phones hoppin baby. Let's take 45,000 calls between now and to a clock. Who is that? Although. Quite frankly, I'd rather read this next. I don't have a whole bunch of stuff here, but I got a couple of things that are must I have to do. Fact three of them must must read. Doug Thompson the day freedom of speech died in America. Perfect. He says the moralistic tight asked cretons who now run the federal government. One another one Thursday. And that great. We. We. We. Yeah. The moralistic tight asked cretons who run the federal government. One other one Thursday when clear child communications a large contributed the campaign of President George W Bush. Dumped Howard Stern from its channel radio stations because of huge fines levied by the FCC. I don't know which Schmidt had put these both those in charge of the nation's morality, but they f dot big time. You see a lot of words in there. I can't the. Oh, my guy did he say both the effort and assorted one sentence. Can we do something about this? He says. Not yet. That more on that W pointed attorney general of the west along with the brain dead he said the FCC and the ballless Greek course in Congress can at the moment sensor radio and TV airways, but not the printed word not yet. He says not yet, but John Askrock doesn't give a damn about the constitution. So you can be sure this puritanical. Whole is planning an assault on the rest of us who gave the. Have the goal to speak our minds and practice the so called constitutional guarantee of free speech. Well, he's got him on here. The ones we can't say. Askrock already has an expensive taxpayer funded operation set of in Washington with dozens of people watching dirty movies, scanning websites and examining books that they self-acquired were on pornography. We know for sure how much this Bible thumping desperate is spending on his personal war against bear boobs and dirty words, but the estimates run into millions and whenever he brings a case to trial, he usually loses. Even in this homestead of Missouri, which apparently knows Ashcroff are what he really is since they preferred to want to dead man rather than we like him. It took a jury of 12 women ages 40 to 60 less than three hours to toss out one of his cases against the video store that rented sex education tapes. But clear channels capitulation to Washington's gang of sanctum on the asypricrets shows just how out of control the whole mess has become since Janet Jackson flashed a nipple brooch in Crested boob during otherwise lackluster half time show it to Super Bowl. In the knee jerk over reactive folly that is followed the FCC threatened to find clear channel nearly half a million because Howard Stern talked about sex on his radio show and accompanied that talk with fart sounds. The fine for comes from living the maximum amount 27 five against each clear channel station for each infraction. Congress now wanted to be left behind in this war list of words he wants to raise the maximum fine to $500,000 per occurrence and that has radio and TV station scared schmittless. The sad fact is that many of these hypocrites see in their spouses bang young staffers of each other and then vote to punish others for being a moral only answer the surrealism. Television now we're scrambled away to chose kids will for broadcast to cut out anything they think might offend Washington's moralists live events are now taped the late so someone can't delete button just in case somebody says or does something sexy. Even NASCAR where the good old boys used to be able to say what they really felt about some. Who knocked him into the wall announced it would find any driver or custer and radio and TV interviews. Damn when did this nation swing back to the days of the Puritan what's next which burnings in Salem mass. And how can an administration that sends young Americans to die in a war declared by deception claim the moral high ground when it comes to TNA. When the clever way said that because he does actually say that to and ask I can still say ask. Personally I don't like Howard Stern's radio gig didn't care for when he started in Washington air flowed after one of its plans cracked in the 14th street bridge and turned call them on the air and asked what the fair was from National Airport to the bridge. But this is a nation founded on the concept of freedom and freedom. Let me say it again. This is a nation founded on the concept of freedom and free speech and stern should be free to do and say what he wants. Those who don't like it have the freedom to listen to other station just like those who don't like the fact that they use a dirty word in this column are free to other website. Yet those who claim to be patriots and love this country sit back and applaud the increasingly repressive annex of the Bush administration and do nothing as our freedoms disappeared to the toilet. Even in Iraq where we're supposed to be bringing democracy to the masses the US government shut down a dissident newspaper. How can we bring democracy to the Iraqis if we don't allow freedom to speech ourselves if freedom of speech no longer exists in this country how they how can we have sported. What a great calm I couldn't have written better myself Doug Thompson the day freedom of speech died in America's smoking ship.com. It's on our website. I's going to talk you go boy. How the hell can we export freedom of more taken into the way from the American people that's what I'd like to know who the hell. Those are just going to take the filth away from good. Maybe there's only so much freedom in the world and we're just shifting it around. Where's it going? I never thought of telling a handbag so we can follow it. 19 till one at. Damn Q.A.M. Whatever the hell it is. Most disgusting program I urge everyone to complain to this station. I'll so pop up like nothing you've seen before. Excuse me. A steam father. What is it my child? We have something I must tell you. What is it my daughter? Oh father, I'm afraid to tell you. Afraid to tell me your own father? I fear I will be ashamed upon our family. Lonsense. I am your father. I love you very much. You must tell me what is wrong. You promise you will still love me. Of course my sweet child. A father's love is not erased by a simple mislead. Very well. I am. I am pregnant. Oh I see. Did you still love me father? Of course I do. But since you are pregnant and not married. Yes father. I am afraid I must drag you down to the town square. And with the help of my friends and neighbors, I will stone you today. My daughter. If he is written that this is the punishment for what you have done. Because you check again. That's only the grounded. No. Grounding is not what. I must have used gold. It's the first step. I focus on a fundamentalist and it will always stand. Me I speak with you. My esteemed husband. This is my wife. I have something to tell you. I am having an affair. Oh, right. Yes. Are you going? I have to look back. You are collecting stones. What do you mean? Yes. I must drag you to the town square. Where are you? Of course we stone today. No be an admirer. I have followed the lives of the Fuckness and I have made. They deal with the many problems that plague them. Oh my I speak with you. My esteemed father. Yes my son. We need to stop him. Last night I used illegal drugs. Well, what do you know? You are one lucky boy. Oh, why is that father? You are going to get stone two nights in a row. You are an ungrateful boy. You are a guiding guy. The guiding guy. I just saw the location in fact there were. I mean, has there ever been this whole one. I should end a god. Has there ever been any group of people more than like 20 in the group. Didn't think that God was on their side. God is the world. The Nazi's headed on their Belmocles and WWE 2. AirBee, a country, every group of people, every tribe, God is our God, of course, that's because their ancestors invented them in the first place. So they thought, they'll approve it by going to war with you and God will help us win. Watch. That's right. Our new no-can-do nation rights marine down the New York Times. Young Americans are bravely fighting and dying in Iraq, trying to fulfill the audacious vision of George W. Devotion Dick Cheney, three-mold Iraq and the image of America. But while we try to turn them into us who have we become, the president presents himself as an avatar of American values, plain spoken cowboy and tough fly boy. But county rice is testimony on Thursday, raises the depressing possibility that we've lost the essence of our frontiers spirit. The ingenious individualists who gets around the system and faces down the drones. From Abigail Adams to Sam Sot Tom Sour, it abugs money to Jimmy Stewart's Jefferson Smith, to Indiana Jones, the best American character is plucking nimble clever and vetted. So it's disturbing to see our government reacting to crises with a jaded shrug and lumbering gate, especially since rubber against such a creative comedian like enemy. Consider the pathetic performance of NASA, which inverted its motto to failure is an option by shrugging off warnings about the safety of the 7-kilombie astronauts who burned up coming back to earth and not trying to set up a rescue shuttle. There's no-can-do spirit, Mark George Tenet's lame excuses to send it as in February, who wanted to know why the CIA never picked up the trail of Marwan Al-Shishi, the pilot who crashed flight 175 in the South Tower 9-11, even though the Germans gave the agency his name in telephone number. They didn't give us a first and last name until after 9-11 Mr. Tenet said. And what would Elliot and essay about an FBI that plus computer savvy that American pre-schoolers and Islamic terrorists? The FBI is only halfway through modernizing its computers, which could not be for 9-11-do two searches at once, such as Al-Qaeda and flight schools. Can't we draft Bill Gates for duty? This ominous passivity was threaded through the testimony of Ms. Rice a brand-en-accomplished woman who should represent the best of America. She blames his stomach and structural impediments that prevented the CIA and FBI from sharing. She complained that other people hadn't recommended what she should do, even the terrorist were faulted for not giving specifics. The screeching chatter in the spring and summer of 2001, there will be attacks in the near future that Nagyank Mr. Bush and his team from their Iraq fixation. But they don't tell us when Mr. Rice protested, they didn't tell us where they don't tell us who, but they don't tell us how, paging Nancy Drew. In conclusion, intelligence didn't bother the Bush team when it wanted to be actionable on Iraq or engage in tit for tat with Sodom. I'm sorry, engage in, fuck or tat with Sodom. The August 6, 2001 presidential daily briefing remarkably headline been lodged determined to attack inside the United States, mentioned Al-Qaeda's wanting to hijack planes and the 70 FBI field investigation did a suspected Al-Qaeda sleeper cells inside the U.S. The briefing had three-month-old information that Al-Qaeda was trying to sneak into the company for an explosive attack, no wonder the CIA chief and counterterrorisms are running around with their hair on fire. What should have made Condy hysterical she deemed historical. WKP fishing and denouncing Sodom while Condy said for a glam Vogue photo shoot and interview. On Iraq they run rough shot over the system, on Al-Qaeda, Condy blamed the system, saying she couldn't act on Richard Clark's plan until it was a strategy, a policy, tasking meetings, etc. The FBI officials with Nord Colleen Rally, she tried to break through the uptos leadership of Louis Freeze FBI to get an evidence on Zacharias Musawi and Kenneth Williams, the finest agent who outlined the Al-Qaeda plot to train Arab terrorists in our flight schools and not been held accountable. Why aren't the heroic Miss Rally and Mr. Williams running something? Dick Clark has struck a chord because his passion and efforts reflected those great American virtues of ingenuity and brashness. Even if he was a bit of a cowboy loading up his 357 side-on to return to the west wing on the 9th, 9th, 11th and at least he wasn't dosing through high noon. Just as Marie and down the New York Times it's on our website, Niorage.com, go see Victoria Principal in the all together if you want. She's old. Full to an old picture. What's so Merlin Mororos pretty old too we had her on one day last week? Right? Oh, it was probably a fake. We don't. She never did anything like that. Right. Not to old the Norma Jean. The Queen. Which ways do you care about the least is our pull quite today? Golf 162. Golf. Take a look good look at an H-D-T-V. Religion 119. Howard Stern 92. What is? I don't know why is it every time I come back for the first of the the it's strange in here. Howard Stern 92, hockey 86, the Marlin's 38, the stock market. Buck third man. Politics 166-3. Who just any forgot about it? Who cares? 560560. Are we getting a flood of call here or what? No. Isn't I was it's still gray and nasty and dark and raining and oh man. It's grayish but not like it was. Because Neil you've got to come back to South Florida for the great weather. Right. It's been great. The long story. Yeah. Yeah. Can't fix me up at the airport on Saturday. We could just about to stay even. I look up in the sky because I realize we're in what happened to the sun. And right over the city was dark and dark and dark and cloudy. I thought oh here we go again. And somehow that kind of like past. Pass over. 560560. Pound 560 on the ATT. We got some of those Marlin Championship rings. Huh? What? Well they made 50,000 of them in the overhead. 45,000 people show up. W2QAM hello. And then I think next year what we ought to do is give away if there's a lock out. Panther hockey tickets would be good too. W2QAM hello. Neil I apologize if you already talked about this but the power turns but on the 96.1 FM. Has anybody mentioned that when you get into the city down here in Miami that you can't hear the station anymore if almost like it's being injured? What do you mean 96.1? 96.1 on the FM band. What is that? What station is that? I have no idea. I just heard about it over the weekends. So like I said I apologize if anybody mentioned it but driving into work today. I have an element that's been on that station since he was caught off a clear channel. Is that a Palm Beach County station? I would have to think so. No no no no that must be the station. It must be the busiest station in a west coast. Maybe that's what it is. The body of my head is something about Naples or something. Yeah that's it. But what you hear after his show went off is almost like I don't know. It's almost like urban music. I couldn't tell you what it was but out in candle no problem. You get towards the city and and you could not hear it anymore. Well city in a little way from Naples man. Right I hear you. Much of for those dirty channels. And last week's commission hearing was that was some of the best. I mean that was some of the best radio I've heard. I mean when you think about the kind of leads as long as it's over. That was great. But listen to the lawyer. Just go after her. Yeah. Oh my god. That was a lot of the people. I mean people just need to wake up and you know either we have an inept government or a corrupt government either one and that excuse. So let's pray for us. Okay pal. We have a wave of view from the border. All right. Thank you. 560505050. Pond 560. All the AT&T. So we must be talking about the Beasley station over there in West Coast and of course the Infinity station at other stations that carry the same show for which the FCC find the clear channel stations. They're not going to get off the hook. That announcement should be coming any day. See what I'm saying. Can't wait. Wow. I'm just telling you. I don't want to see the Beasley is get fine for anything because then Booker Brian might lose that 50 bucks a week that he's getting for the extra comedy. That took me how many weeks to get them to finally cut loose with that. Well they didn't really cut loose to it but they just find a give it back. But third man. Well third week. Yeah. They finally came to them because they wouldn't stop banging away on that. I mean, you know it's ridiculous. 50 bucks. So 50. 50 dollars. Petty is even a word for it. It's idiotic. This is a company that's listed on a major's a stock exchange. Multinemillion dollar company when there are how many stations they got. That's a looping. Whatever they got. I don't know. 50 bucks. And they have to have a big solid dancing clear. It's his wine. You know I talked to Greg. I got that of course so the other one. Well Greg. It's $50. Man. Seriously, I want to tell you one thing. Yeah. If there is a heaven. They probably have a different category for different. I've got it. It is probably I have a called pansy heaven. Now I'm sure it's probably going to go there or pansy hell. One or the other. And I have a feeling I know some people are going to see what I get there. You know what I mean? It's a very fluffy cloud. Yeah. Heaven. 12.50. Well don't forget he is risen. That's what they're going to be saying. When I get up there to pansy heaven. Oh, there's Neil up there. He is risen. He's up in the sky. Hey, if you're fat, don't be like all these other people at George knows all those brothers who are dying from fat. That's just, you know, it's overwhelming to me because I'm fat. And especially right now because I'm real fat. Yeah, put out some more candy, John. Okay. The nice thing on you. He was about your shape. John or your brother, dead brother, yeah. Fan. Fat. Right. Right now, I can barely function. That's how fat I am. After this weekend, I was down like one, 93 before I came back because I made a really conscious effort. Because I was up right about the 200 level there for a few days. And then I came back and just between the race track and all the candy in the crap in my house and all of these things, here I am. Just barely hovering on it. So I'm going to pansy heaven, man. But if you don't want to go to heaven or hell, yet, if you don't want to be risen quite yet, here's the answer for you.

Oh, and then there's, uh, since somebody wanted us to check out that for real thing, which I can't be by the way, to my time. Uh, is this kind of kid? This is a little, uh, piece of memorabilia. 560, 50560, pound 560, on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. I dare one of you barbarians who was there fighting over the free programs at Pompo Park on Saturday. I'd dare you to call in on a show, okay? You miserable bastard you, you lunatics, you animals. Even a bunch of wild school kids crazed hot up on the oxies would never wrecked like that. You know, you can't, you can't in your wildest dreams. The only way they could have acted more psychically if they would have put out free deli out there on the counter and just and poor, uh, what's going to happen to run for a life? The parent told me, play station two distribution day at toys or else. Nothing like, and not even like this. Because that was a zoo. Yeah. He told me to do this other way. But I had to write people getting into fist fights. I got to have that for my kid. Nothing like this, right? And she kept saying, if you'll for and getting more and more fusted, and she's such a nice person. I mean, gosh. Sorry, Toby, even though I had nothing there with it, she's a sweetheart. How would you like, how would you, I mean, we got crap here. But how would you like to have to deal with that clientele? No, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I always say to her, this stuff is going on and it goes on often. I quite like this. I would say better than you than me, because I don't know, because at least I can hang up on them. How do they do with it? See, I'm old. Okay. I don't have to tell you. I'm getting, but no matter how old I might be, I try to envision myself ever behaving like that. Couldn't do it. How do you, how do you, how do you, how do you, exactly? How, what were those people like 10 years ago? What were they like 20, 30 years ago? What were they like when they were, I'm third of me. Yeah. How do you become like that? In considerate rude pushy of notches disgusting, intolerant. But he has risen. Where here's line nine, our first line nine of the day. WQAM hello. Oh, yes. I know what you mean about the old nasty people. Yeah. I work at a retail establishment. I'm not going to name it in West. Oh, right. And I get nothing but people every day saying, senior guest can't please. Yeah. And I'm just like, what is, how do you, you're just, count right up your butt? I'm telling you, man, it's just, you know, then they turn around. What do you have to be speculating elders? The word, where is that written? And what Bible is that written? Respect your elders. I respect people who act like decent people. I know. I know. It's just, it's horrible. And so far, that 96.1 station from Fort Myers has stern. You can only really get that if you live in like Wellington or Kendall or when those really BFU S suburb. Oh, who don't want to live there? No, I know. I sure sell got out of there. If you go, there's a psycholotlute13.tk that tells you basically how to listen to it, turn on the internet and all that. It's, it's very complicated. I've never tried it, but if you're really hardcore, that's the way to do it. And this is so frightening, the way that this country is gone. This is 2004. Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. My head's in here. I hate to interrupt you. But I'm so glad you reminded me of something. I don't want to hold it to go by. All these people that are cool on about Al Franken and they were America. On Friday afternoon on CNN, I wanted to cry. They had Al Franken and some wake-up old bag, some talk brought who he had those who she is to discuss the Howard Stern fine and what's going on. Al Franken, all he wants to talk about is Bill O'Reilly. You know, if you say, hey, what time is it? A Bill O'Reilly says it's, I mean, this guy is so weak and so wouldn't. Many may sell, we're looking like a Mexican jumping bean in heat. That's how boring Al Franken is. And the performance that these two bozos put on there, they had no idea what they were talking about. And Fracan, at least he said, well, I've only really been on radio eight days. And I thought to myself, good choice, Tammy, my own there talking about freedom of speech. And about what talk radio is all about. I still never understood why they didn't pick up somebody like you for that. Because I don't understand why they picked up Brandy because she didn't read it for years and years. But it does makes him, you know, Al Franken's great in all, but I don't know, whatever. He's great as a writer. He's not a broadcaster. You know, Bob Woodward, where I keep saying this over and over again. Bob Woodward's a great journalist, but as a broadcaster, he's like, Don, I'm a sin drag. Oh, there's a scary pot. Oh, I don't know what to say, man. Have a great day, Palin. Take care. Five, six, seven, five, six to you. Al Franken, oh, brother, if you'd have seen that thing on Friday, if you would, you would weep, glad it in. Oh, man, I wish I wouldn't. W to Q and hello. Q, I am. Yes, sir. Get off that speaker phone, please. Okay. There you go. I hear. I hear you. I heard you from some said, and stop Miami. And I can pick up that station just fine. But, um, and for my husband anyway, I used to be neighbors with Glen Hill. Yeah. And I was bewildered for ever. I was curious why he was a band from the show. Was it something he did or? Why he was fired from the show? Yeah. Yeah, because he'd be a star-act like a spoiled child, because he didn't like talking about the cubs, about sports, about this, and about that. And I realized that he was becoming more of an impediment than an asset to the show. And we said, bye-bye. Bye-bye, Bernie. Remember that play? Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you that. That was probably the best part of your show was, uh, Zayton. Zayton, and uh, Katya. Zayton, sure. No question about it. Man, I tell you. On a real radio station with a real signal, with real audience living and breathing people as opposed to this place. But have a great day, pal. I saw that billboard coming to work this morning. The one on the turnpike. Oh, man, the ones hidden behind the trees, you know? They only see when you get right on top of it. What do you? Yeah. And it says, uh, WCWA, and the arages tended to listen. Uh, I thought, why? What is that, sir? I think I'm okay with these people. Huh? But what happened to the ones with a bikini plan? They're around. I see that one depends on where you're at. I see. Well, this one was sure pretty damn weak. I see the bikini one, and I see the, uh, the one of you on the, uh, on the road. But I mean, if nobody has any ID who I am or what they show us all about. Well, they go listen. What? But what would inspire them to even tune it on by seeing that thing on air? I see my ugly post. Then you can do it. Beautiful post. Oh, God. Back in the day, I want to say something about that, but I better, f*** coming up. We don't want to get mismuff, I've said to be running up on that. I'm Greg. And of course Greg's on vacation. Greg's on vacation because I guess he saw the counter. I was coming back to town this week and the. Greg hates it. That's right. Scared to death. And if I were him, if I, if I was much of a bozo as he is, see I'm the only one who's on whom and can talk about it. Everybody else is on whom, but they're a little bit a scared for their job. And I was like, hey, I was checking my stocks. Did you see them? If you're in a dead end job, if you're underpaid no for work like George and Josh and just about everybody, right?

Puerto Rico tomorrow. Because nobody else wants them. Which of these do you care about the least? Maybe we got to do this week every day. That's the same pool with the different list of things. Okay. What? Are you right? I just like to concept. In fact, maybe people can send in things that we're supposed to care about that we don't. One of the media keeps telling us. Like the girl in the pretended as she was kidnapped and entered, she was lying. And they made a good point yesterday, which is pretty unusual. But they made a good point on CNN. And that is always on that awful show with Howard Kurtz about the supposedly examining the media. But those are the name of that show. It's 1130 on the Sunday morning. Anyway, the point being, how come the media always seems to pick on one of these stories. And then while there might be 50,000 kidnapped or lost people out there. And kidnapped and lost and disappeared and whatever. They always pick out one that we're supposed to care about. And hundreds of them they've burned. You could just let me know. Is that what it is? Yeah. How shonder it doing? She was ugly. But then again, she was with Gary Conduitt. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. All the media BS all the time, baby. WQA and hello. QA and? Yes. Is this how my second says? Neil. You know, I have a question concerning President Bush. Yes? And my question is this. When he does this campaign as on TV? Yeah. When he introduces himself. Because I approve this message. Yes. Is that correct, English? For him, yes. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T Verizon Wireless Line. WQA and hello. All right. Every day last week. You better get those old files back out again so we can get Ron Rounded up. Keep everybody in town safe. Roll the breeze speaking. He's at it again. WQA and hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I know the Marlon. But you know, I don't think that they're going to do very good down here. If you think it's all it's a front runner. You know, you're going to have to get that phone from the park. I've seen that. Uh-huh. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T, all the fake voices all the time. Well, it took a lot of scissor off the air till 1040. If you'd be doing this way, you should have. You missed a lot of good dead air off the air. And now these people are making up for lost time because they missed that first 40 minutes. WQA and hello. Hey, I'll go in the office. Sure. Okay. Hey, I was looking at the bar 90 tickets weekend. And so, sir. Greg Reed goes on there first. I'm kind of proud on these days. I'm Greg Reed and I approve this message. Can you believe it? Oh, is that clever? All right. Take care of now. I'm going to need to do that. In fact, that's a good point because you ever see Greg Reed and WT together. I think it could be. Yeah. Same person. Same brain. Same mentality. Same haircut. I don't think Greg's as evil as president. Yeah. For you to be saying that is really just, and just don't forget what they're doing. They're doing something. Presidents and senators don't have men killed. Or GM's. Right. But he has risen. Keep picturing this big bat of dough. No, it's just, see, I realize that it makes me look like the bad guy in this because in, I guess they would consider well, that's a fairly innocuous thing. Why does that bother you? It bothers me when these religion is keep trying to push and push and push. Leave all of us to the salon. Nope. I can't do that. Christianity number one. Guess what number two is? Islam. No affiliation. A 4.8 million number take a guy. It's not even close. Islam, Judaism, all the way way down to where I don't have the exact numbers. But I do know a 4.8 million who are like non-believers. Second order of Christianity. And that great? That must be white so nice. There must be weather so tolerant. Okay, although they are doing a lot of swastika painting lately. But that's another story. They're just getting out of their system. But generally speaking, people are tolerant. They're friendly. They're pleasant. They're happy. They're not like grabbing you around that. I say, oh, he's risen. No, you believe it? You better believe it. Well, see, those kind of tactics went out a lot. Supposedly a long time ago. Now, business has been so bad with all these scandals and the pedophile. All this other stuff going on. All the guys stealing all the money from the church that they have to come up with a more direct way. So they're going to make you an offer you can't refuse again. It works so good the first time. Why not do it again? Fastuits. Leave us all alone with your hoax, pocus, with your gobbledygook, with your Jesus and Abraham and Holy Moses and all of this other crap. Leave the thinking people alone. And stop using your house and your car and all the other accoutrements as like a Bill of traveling billboard. I kind of welcome those signs on the cards. Do you know who to avoid? Oh, man. One nation under God. And I think she meant, oh, God. That's what she was talking about. Yeah, positive. Second leg. 560505050. Isn't that the best? We had a few of those while kind of these were satisfying too. Yeah, too bad you missed that day. Yeah, really. Now we had the quietest show that day. We had this in the back. You know, we had some other music going on. It was quite in the accomplishment. If I do say so myself. 56050505050 on a AT&T of horizon. Wireless line. Another similarity between W and Bush. Neither want to be around. I mean, W and the Gray. Permanent vacation, even Stevie Tyler's got the search party out. Permanent vacation, man. W to Q AM. Hello. Yeah, got to know. I have to introduce her. Yeah, no, that's question of how long you think it's going to be before the draft is reinstated. After Bush gets reelected if he does. You think that's that's really what it is. I think January 22nd or third, whatever day is after the inauguration. If that should happen, have them forbid. Yeah, I mean, because, you know, the thing is, let's face it. If it is reinstated, a lot of the chicken hogs are going to become more chicken than hog fish. Yeah, you know, and it's really incredible because, you know, they're not these troops over there. Right. You can't see the records they lied to them. You know, yeah, exactly. Because the funny thing I've a friend who has a son over there and she's really, really, really, how to she's more up in arms than her son as I think right now. See, when he's kid signed up for the military, they weren't told that they were signing up to be used as human slaughter. That's not what they were told to be used as like sitting ducks. And the funny thing is, you think like one of the mainstream media networks would even begin to discuss the draft. Yeah. And so, I mean, is this guy getting such a pair? It's incredible. Yes, it is. And you listen to him, you have a great time. Me too. And that's why it's so convenient for them to even clamp down more on cheap channel. You see, no matter how much money you donate to us, we're going to keep tightening the screws and tightening the screws. And they're good friends. If Fox, they don't have to worry about them. And put in a group of murder acqua is direct TV that he's bought out. You know, pretty soon they're going to be like two one or two sources of all the news, which is why they closed down that new that she eyed newspaper in Iraq. We were going to be free to them in the speech, but only if we approve of it. And you notice how well that went over to, by the way, freedom to agree with us. Yes. We just can't understand why they hate us so much. They're not bringing us to flowers and candy that rumbs felt promised us. We're there for their own good. That's right. They're just too stupid to realize it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 8. And this is, and those people will say, I'm just the connection between Vietnam. 10 Kennedy as usual. He had a stomach on it. He wanted to very few that had the guts. Joe Biden, man, you're just another whimp. Just another wish he was she Democrat. The, it's not only the parallels, it's almost dizzy. We're all over again. Get you into a crack. My way. No business being there based on lies. The Gulf of Tonkin resolution weapons a mass destruction that don't exist. And then Bush is making a joke out of it. He's looking under the table. He's looking at, oh, no weapons over here. It's a joke. You talk about an insult to the parents of the kids who are dying over their every day and who's lives are by the line. I mean, I don't see him over there. I don't see his damn drunken daughters over there. Air every day, more and more kids are dying. And the public is waiting to find those weapons. They don't even talk about that anymore. Now it's going to be this great glorious freedom. Operation Iraqi freedom that the media was peddling at Bull Krapman really realized that the whole thing was based on a lie. They ought to be doing documentaries every day. They ought to be interrupting network programming to put on the real the truth. Look at all the 58,000 kids came home and body bags in Vietnam because of the same damn Spinalist media. And if it wouldn't have been for the kids on a college campuses and a few people would go to like John Kerry who came back and said that it was insanity and slaughtered. Who knows how long is this? They still might be over there killing each other. Madness. And for what? The strut touched the strut, the spread of that evil, comic, pinko empire. The Phantom. Yeah, whatever happened to them. Asked a poll, Piltania. He's too busy stopping sickle, stem cell research. Hmm. He will Satan. That's right. Stop in a fag merges because the fags over there in a Vatican. They went all the hot looking, the swish guard for themselves. That's what I think they're afraid of. They want to keep them all of themselves. 26 past one at five, 60 WQM.

It makes that oil and when you're in a shower. Oh, I take back everything I said about what an enjoyable pursuit that is man. Cutting the cheese in the shower.

All right, I just had three quick things I wanted to ask you. No one will own it. No one will own it. Lab Friday for the first time in a long time I listened to Phil Henry. And he does a commercial now where he's saying Rush Limbaugh's change is mind on everything. And he's helped him with his broad kept in Korea. Are you sure? Like that. He never used to say stuff like that. No, he's he sold a sold of the devil. He's become a right wing Iraqi. That's all. And then tragic on W.I.O.D. when they say W.O.D. is a commercial. When they say the oh, they say the oh, they you do. I heard about that. They still are. Oh, I heard that. W.I.O.D. Oh, I hate that station. Yeah. Well, see, they fight with still laying around in their computers. There's why I guess they decided they were going to go in there and start using some of that crap. Oh, it won't help. They're still as boring as the dog stuff. Anyway. I got you. And number three, that one I forgot what I was in the face. So that's all I have. Have a nice day. Thank you so much. Yeah. W.I. Oh. D. Like that's going to really spice it up. That's going to make your station interesting. I don't think so. You cheap channel clowns. It's going to make them think you're still on there. Oh, is that it? I don't think so because just like I said, only moments ago, even at the guy from Don and Mike W.I.O.D. Oh, I hate that station. You almost have done, uh, do you want to know? Oh, Geronimo. Ha ha ha ha. How can you forget? Woo. Man, were they good or what? Don and Mike. Wow. Yeah, even Mr. Retardo, they're new that. 560560. How 560 on the AT&T of a rise of a rise of a rise of a rise of a rise of a rise of a rise of a rise of a level. We want to get to about 40, 50,000 calls between now and two or five, even though we're up against Al Franken. Seriously, his performance on Friday on CNN, it left me wanting to weep for hours. By the time he, he's just, uh, uh, thunderhead. He's not spontaneous. I mean, a lot of people can write very well, very funny, very critical, uh, but she's and keep in mind speaking of script, what the first day on a air, he wrote everything out long. He might even still be doing that. Oh, god. Good evening, everybody. My name is Mike Spendow. We're going to be doing trivia tonight that reading it off of paid. And that's the, that's the highly talented Al Franken. Al Franken. WQM. Hello. And I think that if Al steps on a mess, you know, like on a sidewalk, he thinks Bill O'Reilly left it. They're just for him. I don't want to say his paranoid to him and say his whole life is the anti-bill Riley. And I hate to break the news to you, but Bill O'Reilly, uh, like the impact he's making in this market, you couldn't find his rating with a search party. He doesn't even exist. He's on, but nobody knows it. See, Al, you're supposed to be on as the anti-Rush, not the anti-bill O'Reilly. The anti-Rush, but even so. Yes, people who want to listen to Al's show don't listen to Bill O'Reilly. Right. Or care about them. Right. So I don't want to hear somebody talking about how many are there. God, third man. WQM. Hello. Yeah. WQM. Hello. Wow. What a rush. WQM. Hello. They doing well. Pretty good. It has some information. I'm, uh, are you still pumping the FCC website? No. Uh, okay. I'm, uh, I guess information. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, person, Lincoln's got a bad headache. Let me say again. I'm not going into jumping into bed with a guy who won't tell us his last name. And I noticed to be sponsored as fall off to almost nothing. I mean, we're else could somebody find a gift horse talking about or looking to give to us up the, uh, but here we were going to raise him, uh, thousands of dollars. Putting money out of our own pocket to get the things started. Put an ad in the most widely read nationwide news paper to promote his website to get the American people whipped up into a frenzy about this. And like, oh, well, uh, you know, I got more signatures than you got dollars. Did you know that was his line to Eric? No. Yes. Well, that's right. This all came down like after, uh, with you, or Friday. Yeah. I got more signatures than you got dollars from the worst it right now. Meaning beside. I don't know. Yeah, exactly. Meaning that he's in the closet. He don't even want to tell us behind the scenes. What he is. And I'm going to raise money for an ad for a guy. Do we? What what happens if he disappears off the face of the earth? What happens to those signatures? Even if he didn't get his million signatures or whatever he's got. See what I'm saying? That's like, uh, the Camille's house. Remember that? That that would be like a QAM putting on their website. Some funny, volony auction when people think the money's going to charity. And it goes in their pocket of the beeslies. That's what that would be like. Some kind of a bait and swish deal. We don't do bait and swish on a show. Just the swish. And it's clearances sitting in our and his little dairy ear. Think of that in June when the beeslies want to run that scam again, then I'm going to be promoting an on this show. Well, guess what's we'd already. No chance. No chance in your pants. Okay. I'm sure there will be promas. All right. Hey, what? Whatever. I don't care. But the shirt is how won't be read by me. Or you. No. No chance. That's a good one. Or Josh. Almost as the word's simple. Yeah. Think of cut a sin. Well, think about it. Yeah. Because that when I think it's clear, that's what I think of real simple. Don't you? Well. And don't forget. Very nice. Can we? Yeah, sure. So what I heard. Want to be. He's a want to be. He's a little sports nerd. Yeah. We're going to put him in that office that paper mache desk where he'd have used to sit in there. And we're going to give him a title. And he's going to sit in there. He's going to be a program director. Oh. Aren't you impressed? Sure. Yeah. I mean, during these tough times, we jack-o. Okay. We don't need a, uh, uh, some kind of a funny, dirty, consuliery. We need a wartime consuliery. A kid curry. Wasn't it good that I knew not to take calls when he told me that the delay was out. I'm proud of myself. Mm-hmm. Give me that. Look up. There you go.

Now, Charles and Diffield Beach, who generally is a pretty good fancier. He says in defense of Howard Stern on not a stern fan. CNN reported the other day. The church had a lot of contributed in George Bush's relation campaign. But that their contribution was 24 times the amount contributed by any other communication company in the country. We already gave the numbers with like 800 grand. In light of this, during allegations that he was on the course of the day, he was on the course of the day. He was on the course of the day, because of his anti Bush comments. Couldn't possibly have any murder. Now, could they? They might or they might not. That's not the point. See, the issue again, unfortunately, because of his massive ego. The issue is Howard Stern. The two guys named Lada just got can't. But the love sponge and Tampa, he got can't. Not to mention the chilling effect that is on radio shows all over the country. Including this one. Although we'll, we'll take our way through. I'm chilling. Yeah. The issue I keep trying to tell these people is not about Howard Stern. It's about freedom of speech. And as big as he may be in his own mind, or otherwise, the constitution and the bill of rights. And the first amendment is a little bit more in part than Howard Stern, or anyone radio show. Charlie, So get with it. Here's the poll question today. Which of these do you care about the least? 714 votes. Golf 204 to which I say. A red choice. We're legit right on golf's ass. 157. Hockey 122. Howard Stern 122. The Marlins only 48.

Stock market 38. Politics 8 and sexually 5. Well, you know, we got some old colleges. They were probably waiting for the free program at Pompano Park Saturday night. If I lived to be a thousand, which I never would. But if I live another 100,000 years, I could never possibly see such a display. Such a grotesque display of lunacy by a bunch of people old enough to know about it. You know what I was talking about? Sure. They're old enough to know better. Use it on the children. I mean, how old do you have to be to know better? I would say, But third of me. Yeah. At the top. Once you get to be 70, 80, 110, you should already be long since old. Maybe they're old enough to forget. That must be it. Maybe that is. Yeah. I've never got like Reagan. Give me a break. Okay. The next time I see this display like that, I'm calling to riot police. Okay. I'm calling the Yenta police. I'm going to bring the Yenta police right out there to the track. And put on a scene to lecture what you ate never seen. Maniacs from win more in cemetery, and you wonder why people hate this town? The ones who do including me? This is not a civilized place. This is not a place where you can see the city. And I'll say it again. I sympathize. Anybody out there's got to work with that element of people. My heart felt some of these go out to you. How could that? I see it Toronto just using example because I do live there a big part of the year. There are people of all ages. Like they're not they're not like jammed all into these onclaves. And these you don't have the condo commandos. It's a whole state of mind where they see the world. And they live in breathing place. People are congregated into ACLFs and condo.

Better go over to Netherlands. Right now. Go to Amsterdam. You better get to good crap. I'll tell you because once the water rises about two inches, that'll be the end of that.
