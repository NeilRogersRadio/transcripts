There's the lyrics. What's the problem, officer? The boy from the radio. The boy from the radio. If you're caught driving without a seat belt, you will be removed from your car and shot. The police now have the authorities who enforce seat belts safety under the new Patriot Act 2. The new laws in effect now, so click it or be shot. Officers don't mind doing this. They are only following orders. It's for your own protection in the neverending fight against terrorism. Terrorists act such as mouth noise. I'm not a fucking person. And fighting. But be annoying to others. So under Patriot Act 2, heeding will no longer be permitted in restaurants. Anyone eating outside the designated eating area? Will also be shot in the eating room. It's the law. They're like saying that the law. The law. It's not the best it is in the instrument. Kind of a little dude. But I've worked for us. Huh? They're really. Yeah. You're probably sitting there wondering, what he had. Blitz that fighting sound out or not. Yeah. That's why I've played it. I want to show off my great job that he's over the weekend. They're skizzles. Yeah. Anyway, plus I liked that anywhere a lot that bit. When you didn't tell him off about that disc that I got that was all messed up and screwed up, no I taught. Plum forgot I figured you would it. No, I mean well we had all this other seat. The computer realizes it's not only the operations manager, but he's also the part-time sales manager because screw in don't do it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She don't do it. Not that anyway. She's busy managing other things. But in a rate so those part of his other job and every day when he comes in, I could jump all over his ass which is another story. About all these sales problems. What does piece of copy? Yeah. It's just garbage that we got a bunch of slackers back there that we don't want to do any work. It's just an ongoing thing never going to change. And as reading how much point talking about it said that I enjoyed doing it, just to give them a real stuff we're seeing is zero collectively. I think they all thought tied direct disease is what I'm thinking. Well, what there is close as they are. They're all sitting in little pubical spectrum. Anyway, George probably took I don't think I can come close to that full adured to guess that maybe the definitive pull Eric came up with that one and I, a lot him loudly. Did he really hear Eric came up with that? That's right. But once Eric had to be turning the reins of control over to Josh's matter. If I can't even find a cut loose for this, this insanity this obsessive behavior of his, where he refuses to just turn over a lot of that work to Josh. You just aching and dying. That's so much to do with the work but to make a few bucks off it. Oh, he is aching and dying. Right. What is that going to happen? Anytime soon I'm going to go. No. I avoid because I don't want to call Eric and I would come up with a first and June and I made a resolution just about 30 seconds ago. That once June first comes for the rest of the year and you're, Eric and I don't have any verbal communication. It just, it just is better all the way around. You don't see him? Well, sorry. Okay. It just makes for a happy or existence. It's June number one post. All right. I can smell it in the air. That schedule we had last week with the ball games is pretty good tomorrow. We got a nice schedule too. We got a good scan going which we like a lot. We got Marlon's 3 game. It's 12 30 tomorrow and then the game will want to climb the reds in the Marlon's again. 105. What is it about 80 game series or what? Seems like they've been playing the reds forever but anyway. And that's then we got the trends coming to 11 30 tomorrow morning. The arbitrend. Oh, that's a big radio news today by the way before we do a much of anything else. Although here's the result of your Eric's pull yesterday. This is almost as good but not quite as paper or plastic. Which it's a little spastic yeah, we considered that. In addition with now you're talking about regular potato salad or like German potato salad, which is a horse of a different color. Well, tell us about German potato salad, maybe I don't know about it. It's white. Okay. In fact, if your potato salad isn't white, it's probably like rancid. No, because there's some muddoodoo in it. What? Mustard and diced or yellow pickles? Oh, the pickles are green but they, you know, it's not good to know. No, green. No. It's the mustard. Most of the potatoes sounds still could be a white. Otherwise it's probably got a lot of a botchillism and crap and I would throw it out. Is it that if you're ready for a quick trip to the emergency room? What the conversation potato salad be? Here's the definitive pull all these years. Oh, and leave it to Eric to come up with that. White 406. Yellow 330. 736 votes even on an idiotic question like that. That goes to sure our crowd, huh? Such as they are. I'll be forward to the thing about Mel Carmesan, Howard Stern, all of that latest excitement. Okay. Other excitement. Carbomis, loaded today in central bank that outside the office is the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which is located just outside the green zone headquarters of the US-run coalition. At least two people were killed. Funny, we're injured. Meanwhile. This matter of fact, the bomb was just one of the civil blasts heard in the Capitol, just after reports circulated at a Gazi Mashaal Agile Aliyahor. I was like those guys with four names, one of them hi-finated. Gazi Mashaal Agile Aliyahor, a current head of the Iraqi Governor Council, and then selected this president of the interim government said to take power on June 30th. Another blast followed by gunfire, said a mushroom cloud, 100 feet building of the dust the air hanging over the city. See back when Bush Mashaal was talking about that mushroom cloud, we didn't realize we've talking about over Baghdad. Kodos and aircraft were either flying over Baghdad. Elsewhere, Carbomis exploded near the US military base in the woods in Iraq today. 11 Iraqis were killed. 26 were wounded in the explosion. It's emancipation by the depotation is what it is. That's what they're growing. Thousands and thousands and thousands of their Iraqis so that we can democratize Iraq and make them free for the rest of all this other crap. It's really sad. And then we'll sit back and move like that. Try and do no matter what time you tell these people. Like how do we go? Mel Carbomis is an out-advaya com. Or I also, I've not mentioned it right now, speaking of it. You know, it's Al-Fakit is working for free. That's how well air America is doing. You know, they did good day at numbers, but like I told you before the show today, we don't need air America in New York City. John Kerry and the Liberals don't need any help in New York City or in what in New York State in this year's election. They'll be in New York State by a glance like I just like Gordon. That's not a problem. If you're going to counteract Russia in Berlin and Bill O'Reilly, and all the other right wing Nazis on the air in America, Sean Hannity, all of these clowns, then the way you have to do it is be like syndicated national. You're all over the country. Not just in markets where like, you know, carries all the, what's the problem? What is that accomplished? Even if they were still on the air in Chicago and LA, does John Kerry need help in Chicago or LA? No, no, assuming I'm saying, what is that? So assuming that the whole concept was made sense, which it didn't in the first place, it's just, so Al-Fakit is going to be working for free. It's part of that impassioned facts I got last week about. All he shows getting better every day while he's working for free so that they can keep the thing on the air. Now we just hope that the goddess, that she don't have to work for free, because I don't think that's in her game plan. I think once you took that game, she had the idea that, well, we just won't get paid, but we'll save the world for more bush stuff like that. I don't think that was part of the deal. To labor of love. Anyway, there you go, just like Eric, it's a labor of love and erosis. They don't come much more neurotic than Eric, I'm saying that right now. And I'm not going to, don't come here, please. Because it's June 1st, I just drew the line on the sand on my calendar. You're doing a fine job, that's a great pull question, if, yes, good George. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, I'll bet. Why don't you, yellow? Mel Carmesan resigned unexpectedly as president and CEO of ViCom Corp. The company also announced that chairman and CEO of some of the redstone, the company's largest shareholders indicated that he'll relinquish his rural CEO's old in three years. The media conglomerate named Leslie Moonviz, chairman and CEO of ViCom Units CBS and Tom Freston, the chairman and CEO of ViCom's MTV cable, no, works as co-president and co-cheap operating office, you got the idea, you got the idea, you see. Oh, oh! Carmesan is repeatedly reportedly clashed with redstone-reasoners, his contentious contract negotiations got played out in media reports a year ago. I've got time, Carmesan got a contract, this is kind of like the Florida Panthers, extend everybody's contract and then fire them and then have to keep paying them off of wherever ever, although this time Carmesan quit. You got a contract extension through 2006, but reportedly also took back some powers going to do them at the time of ViCom versus the CBS and May of 2000. It goes on and on and on and on. Redstone 80 has got 71% of ViCom's capacity shares now. Why that means anything to anybody, of course, in South Florida, Howard Sternen on the year and on more, thanks to ClearChannel. By the way, Glenn Garbett, if they heard you're a real, okay? Finally, last week, he wrote a column of try and missed until I saw Rebubble and led us to the editor in the Heraldis morning. What it didn't need you are. Oh, well, ClearChannel, let's have an athlete. They only own 1,200 out of 10,000 radio stations, that's not a monopoly, yeah. Right. And it builds more than all the avenues for concerts, all of these things. You know, now they don't have no monopoly on music. In addition to which it's guy, the entire number is in what radius relative, it's how many they control in major markets. That's what's a scary, like in South Florida, that if goes into anything about radio in South Florida, he'd be writing about that instead of a bunch of crann. About some front line in documentary on PBS. And the judge had tragic, really, it's. Then Garph another in a long list of losers at the Herald. Howard Stern gives Sherry Redstone thumbs down. According to the New York Post, Howard Stern told his list his last Thursday that Sherry's going to run the company not male, definitely he knew something. He then added that by-compresident C. Oh, oh! Now, Kermiton would leave the company, which he did this morning, because of some of the Redstone and some of his daughter, who I understand, is really difficult. Howard said, the newspaper was on to say that Stern, K. Rock sales manager Frank Florez, and a counter-sicative Sam Ben Ruby all will leave the company of Carmesan Goes. But he left this morning, so we'll see. If we've already made a patch here and said, Trans-Dise in St. General Manager, Tom Fusano for not being on board, I was going to remember that you wouldn't walk out without us. That guy who gave you your start, you're not even a little dude. Bleep you, he said, meaning the GM. Sherry Redstone 50 is director of Icon and President of Perron company, National Amusement. So there is the reason that the Carmesan leave in Fai-com is significant. As Stern is threatened to walk, of course, that goes on every week. He's been threatened to walk out for how many months now? Not turning me in! And it's just a witchy, and now you've got, you've got a tall and old lawn there, it's out for what you know, which when the numbers come out tomorrow morning, 11, 30 when that trend comes up, then you're really going to see two months without Stern. And of course, then the following one when the next trend comes up, that's going to read that they're real biggie. You're saying, there are the numbers, they'll come right back up. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, you're missing the point, but you'll see too much of their performance on Zeta, minus the Stern competition, that ought to be really, really interesting. I just want to take it right now. How many people want to hear this tale will be treatment to you? About a 10 to 5, 60, WQM, and also the only thing I'd mention even when I'm doing this focus we've done the Designing Times, about the world's most beautiful women. Yeah. WQM, hello. Yes sir. Good morning. When is this? I think that George has today, but did you see that piece about where she holding the doms gone as a trophy? Yeah, we had it on our website, yeah, thank you. Faculty of Arts and Interesting Articles about the Freudian significance of that. The world's most beautiful women, this is another one of these, this pool is so ridiculous. Now, what is it saying as article, who did this pool? The fashion industry experts, but it doesn't say what organization has got to be in the sort of called summer. It's really poor article because it's a national post which is a crappy paper, but it anyway, we'll get to it. When you hear who they selected as the most beautiful woman you are going to, what you already know because I told you, but it's cute and this is very, very aggravated. And it's all subjective, obviously, but the person they picked should even be in the top hundred. Unless you're well, ten thirteen at five sixty, WM by now you should know about balance for or none, and what did you say? I didn't say it. You start with him again. Back home, God. Or check that that thing about the during the bottle and beer in the balance for life. I'm talking about it, right? When you stop so I can do this spot already, please, this is one of the worst pieces of copy ever saw in my life, which includes a lot of territory from the sales department. I don't need any extra help and screw it up. Now, big issue for most people on balance for life is you do the five day plan of the seven day plan. The five day plan does not accrue the weekends, but what if you just want a few meals and set it in Sunday? The seven day plan's got all the meals, but what if you have dinner plans for the weekend? It's all or nothing. Well, now, if you understand that, balance for life is created the six day plan. On Friday night, you'll get one sack for the entire weekend so you can choose which meals you want to eat and when. The best part about this plan is since balance for life is the only meal delivery service that offers you choices. You can choose meals from either of these Saturday or Sunday menu. And to add to this plan, if you tell the wonderful people at balance for life and that's what they say about themselves, where you've been eating out, they'll say to which items on the menu are balanced for life approved. A lot of complete service and balance for life is working exclusively with a few local restaurants, the label menus balanced for life approved.
