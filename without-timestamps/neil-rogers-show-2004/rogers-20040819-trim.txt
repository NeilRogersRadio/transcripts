She's only so illy here now! Looks like it's like the roast guy! As from the mighty role models, Robert Bush has body style and ice goes over ice not now! It has to be when she alive! She raised more criminal clouds! But for Bush has body style and ice! And she's best-me, old and crafty! And she rides more pride than that thing! She's a troublemaker! And she's so great, so I need water! I know that day why so far, What's like he's carrying in a golden golden queen of size and hat! But he's got me now! He never meets a horse! And this is always a fool of mine! That's what he's really thinking about! But for Bush has body style and ice! He gave us your points and jams, boys! That's our style and shame! Robert Bush will be rich in fat! And smells just like the magic sauce! And a big hat! Robert Bush will be rich in fat! And smell just like the magic sauce! Robert A. Mention did you ever see Ernest Borgon and Barbara Bush together? Sandperson! That's beautiful! I might just play that all day today! Bush see where Geldy went! He's getting a singing career! Now that we got all the sex attendants today, we have a quarter hour more than we had on Tuesday! Although not quite as much time as he had yesterday because you were paying a penance now! You're paying your penance! I don't have any luck! So that's why I go! Is they finished up at 10.56 this morning on the Stern Show, which is really very magnanimous of them! Giving us this extra, let's see! Four and nineteen minutes more than we had on Tuesday! Should we play that idea or something? WQM line before a lot of it now? If I can play that spiffy new legal idea to make Clarence happy and by the way Clarence, I would take a look again at that, Schedule you have on the words as the Howard David Show! How much does he have on the rockers in the woods? How much does he have on the rockers in the woods? How much does he have on the rockers in the woods? Okay, now they're going! And where did that was just the idea? I was panicking the Josh might put his bottle of something! Huh? Don't worry! How do I know? We don't know what's going on. We're just clambered at a seat of our ass! So speaking of that, and also Gary, I'm ready to go! You came back to your senses! Whoever Gary defects or is, I guess you know him, right? I know of him! He's one of our sponsors! He's there! Who is there? Are they really? Well, like I said, we love Gary and his people a lot! Whoever just tell his people to talk to our people! But a little confusion there because we can't scream the steering wheel! I certainly hope Robert Graper is pressed that button in the control room before he goes home before he goes to what if his triple-came meetings! I got Eric on the case now! If he doesn't hear a screaming, when I hold him, the show starts then he tells me and I tell them! Tell him to call him off! Or he tells you? I'll give you a bit of a question! I told him I have some inside business to take care of! I told him! So he tells you a new pass of right along! Get that screaming going! And moment that the steering goes by by! Because we can't scream the steering! The steering show! Because it's much too important for that! And God forbid that people should actually be able to go online in here! Which I don't understand that! I don't understand why I feel charges people to get on his website! Are you sure? Doesn't he? Yeah, that's why he's got so few hits on there! If you look at the stats on his website, it's like a NEMIC! Even though he's on 80's and stations! And that's because when they write mine wants to pay for some crappy website! We have a good website! I wouldn't, there is no website! Of any kind! I don't care what's on there! Well, I can think of a few things! But sure to that! I can't imagine anything that you pay the non-sexual nature, right? Right! That you would pay for to a C to read their access to on the internet! I can't even imagine! A dead celebrity! Although you probably don't even know who it is! Elmer Bernstein? Who's that? Oh! The versatile Oscar-winning composer with Scord-Srecht's movie classics is the Ten Commandments, and I give him 7 to call a mockingbird, the greatest scape, and true grit! Rimes with Schmidt! Did they yesterday who was 82? Elmer! Elmer Bernstein! Bernstein died in his sleep at his home, said, Publices Cathy Muton. She said Bernstein been in family health for some time, who's nominated for the Academy Award 14 times, most recently in 2002 for Far From Heaven. Did you see that? No! I'd be enough, his only win is only Oscar-winning was for the 1967, from Thurly Modern Millie, which was one of his weaker works, as he was here. Among his war notable efforts, were the scores for some came running, Birdman about could trans the greatest scape, Hawaii, the great Santini, oh, I love the great Santini! With Robert Duval, maybe the best actor of all time, Casted Giant Shadow, my left foot! A river runs through it! A river runs through it, we like that movie a lot! Sure! Devlin and Blue Dress, and Gainesy New York, he also composed several works for Santini, because he's dead, he was 82, was sick for a long time now. But better hurry it up, because we got two polls today, and only what turns out to be a three-hour show today. Plus we got a play, we played the Marlon Game for last night. Sorry, you're so excited about that. Like we were discussing before this show today, only somebody would have big, only some toughest blowhard with a big ego, would think that any person in his right mind would be upset about working less and getting paid the same. And actually, guaranteed the bonuses, not for the rest of the contract. There's no question about that, because say what you get about the steering show, and we will say a lot today. But there's no question the ratings are going to be spectacular. Even with all the choppyness and the bleeps and all the other, it doesn't make any difference. Anybody who listens to a third team in a commercial break, will tell us since you're eight million dumps, because they just got to get their fixed man. Right? Yeah, apparently. So here's George's poll from yesterday. I'm proud to say I told George, this is the truth. Nobody will believe this. Other than 60 minutes, there's not one TV show on here that I watched ever, I believe it. Well, you're right, it's another Monday, and it's put ball, it's the Patriots are playing. Otherwise, I'll never watch it. What is the best current TV program today? Shepel show, 151, I have no idea who that is. It's pretty good. Okay. Huh? He's reading it. I know that, but I mean, I just don't, if I walked in here right now, I'd say who the hell are you? But in 51 he wins hands down. The Simpson's 117, because they are. Five, eight, eight. Stop Park 109, the Daily Show 99, 60 minutes 90. That's only when I watch. And that's only if I happen to be home. Kirby Renthuzy has him 89, the Sheel 89, which I wouldn't draw about a can't get effects here. 24, 76, 76, 24. See SI 65, knows that CSI Miami, so the Rina Irwinis? Yes, I might have. Didn't even make it on the pole for several. Well, good. Nippen, tuck 62, I read about that one. Yeah, it's got some time. Sounds disgusting and rotesque, yeah, it is. Monday, 9 football, 61, lawn, odor, 60, 60, 150, show about man. The West Wing 45, Penenteller, 44. Bullish mint, that's an name of the show. Yes. American chart, aren't they good buddies with Alice Bennett? Worthy? I guess they were. Yeah, I never listened to that show. American chopper 41, the family guy 37, Ali G show 35, what's that? Fake rapper, interview show. I see sports center 31, star drag enterprise 27, part of the Interruption 27, the Howard Stern show on E22, rescue me 20 with a Reather Franklin, Reno 9, 11 18, a Caliente 14, forensic files 14, Mad TV, a dozen months to garage 12, Experimentalmination 11, I've had that. On to rise 11 blue collar TV, six Laura and America, four, oh, no speaking, Glacier, you know, free for all got a period. That's it. I'll pick that one. 51 votes on George is fine. Poor yesterday. We're going to do two polls today. Here's the first one. Now, this is kind of the 40 we do in the day that they came in because they took on you because you're small, but they didn't have a free week contract. They don't dare mess with me just like I told occurrences morning. Fused weed hard get lost. Who would you, and I'll say it again. I looked at that two AM website and I'm a little bit disturbed. They did finally straighten out the schedule to some degree, but between four and seven it says, the Howard David show. It is not the Howard David show, okay? Make no mistake about it. You know what I mean? Absolutely good. It's a high goldberg suspended non vacation show with Howard David at filling in hopefully temporarily. But anyway, here's our first full question of the day. I'll be sure we do that today. I'll be doing a bit of a full question because we'll only do this till about 12. What? About 13. About 13. Then we'll do the other full. Who would you most like to hear in Acton and Drive between four and seven in the PM on QAM? Here's your choices. Now, you did a similar pull, but that was about basically who should be doing the show with Mo if he wants to get him a show right now. I think God forbid was well one. Right. For thank all birds since it is his show, if he catch my great. It's more Howard David. You have to florist. Steve Geldy Gelsby. Rick and Suds. The big. The crow or I wouldn't listen regardless. In other words, people who just have other places or things. You just don't listen to the show. We'll just listen to me after no more hours for whatever reason. What is this fact you just sent? More fodder for the anti religion shows. The lunacy has no end. You must die a horrific death at a young age and it says, un-valedable. And then the yellow gold seems to already know about the old gold seems to be. We don't care about that. To bad else, some fortunate. He's a little bit a nail homeless shelter part of the time. Who? Any got married again for the eighty-five time. I don't know what that's all about. But now. Is this something that we're supposed to, I should because you only send a different page anyway? No, it's just a thing. I didn't know big deal. Okay. See, that's one thing I wanted to tell you over and over again. The religious not stirred the dangerous ones. Just like those lunatics in Iran. And now the bush stirred up. Didn't you talk about stirring a hornet's nest? I heard somebody say that. That was your expression. Eight million times I heard that. Or at least. I heard the man. During the hornet's nest. That's what we did. We did a lot of reds over there. And now the Iranian say, well, guess what? If you mess with our nuclear reactor. We're going to have a preemptive strike against us. We're going to have a hotty like that. Those am jubans are trying to do again. What they did a few years ago. And of course they've got Luke. So it'll be lots of mary. That's right. Man. Oh man. Talk about a lunatic. And the fact, look at his Ohio. Carry 52 bush 42% undersighted 6%. But again, that's a registered voters. If you look at the likely voters, Kersen had no how by 3% which ain't enough. Which means they're going to act to import tons and tons of dark folks to Ohio on Election Day. We better get that vote out. I'm going to tell you that right now. Including Josh Cord. If you do make that call. No. No. Well, he still have his voter registration card. Right. Some guy in that on the street corridor out there by Chuck Subcenter out there and I was there in 441. Give him a pamphlet, a brochure one day. You know, it's a booty. Yeah. He probably thinks he's registered to vote and all they're going to do is come and, you know, and stare inside your windows at home. Yeah. They got my info. They're they're working. Jamie Presley is behind the being a curtain that he's speaking of working and jerking and working. July 30th, 1977. He was born and makes her 27. Born in Kingston, North Carolina and you do where that is. Since North Carolina is your neck of the woods. They're about to. Found the right. I like these three hours shows man or less. What's the life? No, I'm not going to make sure. We're upset about it. That's what I was supposed to. Oh, no, we're not. We're not going to live this. Make sure. The car's the old fart. Okay. We're silly old. God is an idiot. I know what's really going on. See, the problem with you, Moes. You don't really know what's going on with a whole human race. You're so out of touch. Anybody that would have get his Miller's a guest on. I'm sure what is that saying? I've always told you it's a cluster of four that holds sports for turn. They're all in bed together and they're all like eating out the same trough. It's really, it's an incest to a thing. Anyway, Jamie Presley is behind a B.D. curtain if you're with the age of 100 and have several pieces of ID. John Askcroft is that those B.D. eyes still in action. So keep your hands above account or when you're looking. And you must be over the age of 110. Let's see, cool world. That's what he's still in right now. Death to the supermodels. Evil conneval. May for TV. The karate dog. Oh, that's one of my favorites. For a footprints. The Johnny Chronicles. Demon Island. Not mother team movie. Ticker. Jodor. Tom Caz. 100 girls. MTV. Rock and Jack bowling. Poor white trash. Huh. Best actress. So is that any movie Jack and Jill? Just a whole whole bunch of crap. Also produced death of these supermodels this year. She was the producer. I like that. And let's see. Her self-filography. What was the other stuff I read? The actress. I don't get it. Inked. Spike TV. VGA. Video game awards. Totally gay. MTV. Bash with a hated Carson. David. Why do I still describe him? I can't. I never see him anymore because I don't watch MTV. All that we do get it here. But I can't stand him. Gay. What does that mean? You saying? Oh, I didn't say to that. Let me see. Let's get this other pull going right away. The first one because the second one we're just going to do our presidential pull. sunlight for a year for a seven on the hexane verses. I mean now that is eight and ten and the first peak. Jesse floors have a six but it's not recommended that we get to the top of theadorbury. embarrassing you a little to a few. Now let me say this also to keep the hockey fans posted all 10 of them. It looks very unlikely that there's going to be any hockey season. In fact, that would even take up partial season. The way things are going, they've talks are like an impasse and the league wants to celebrate cap and the players union and the players, the self-heated greedy players, oh we don't want no salary cap. And as a result, they reach the, they're at the fork in a road. And I think they're going to fork all the fans because they're going to be no season. So what they're going to do is they're going to take this bogus world hockey tournament that's coming up and they'll climb on all the money from that and split up very happily. And they'll say, well, now we're going to go our separate ways. And we hate each other in the, we've got to, we've got a bunch of money stashed away so we can survive and screw the fans again. So the reason I mentioned it is because guilty is supposed to be the voice of the Panthers, right? Yeah. Because we don't have a monestation now at all, do we? I don't have it. Is he on? It's not about the threat of it. No, I'm just saying he's just vanished. And of course, since it's unlikely there'll be a hockey season, he ain't going to be doing a hockey game this year. I would say, OUT is what it sounds like to me. I love this. I love this show. Congratulations. Hey, hi, hi, 2019. Now we get home I don't wanna round here, it's gonna be you No I gotta not just let it do, you'll count up I don't wanna get home, you'll count up I gotta gotta go I'll be my dad I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go I gotta go 1118 at 5.60.

This is a... Huh? I thank you, Geneva, the girl would send it to me. Oh, it's him from Jeannie? Yeah. Thanks again, Jeannie. It's a beautiful thing. Now, do we know where this is located? This particular Burger King is, I think, even Dwight Lodderdale would be delighted to eat there, because you know him. She says it's in the area of the magic kingdom around the Orlando. Oh, it's in the central part of the state where the Dumberdans saw us to people live. It's a Burger King. There's a big sign outside of Burger King's his breakfast and the big red sign. I'm gonna eat on the marquee. It says, try our new, ain't this, state burger. That's a big burger. I afford it along the air exit. Burger King, we sure know our ass. So yeah, that's gotta be on our website today. That is a phenomenal thing. Now, again, back to the first poll, which you only have going to the 1230. Why do I feel rushed? You know? Which is good. No, I don't want to relax. I want to like zip it in, because it's already almost known, George. You guys? That's right. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh man, what a scam. Don't tell anybody, though. Who would you most like to hear an afternoon drive? Fortest seven on W2QAM? Now with all these changes and suspensions and firings and highrings and Howard Stern and the Mohawk-Adivided so far. We got 314 votes. We're gonna kick some serious ass on this poll. Hankleberg, 110. Rick and stars 108. It is a battle, nose and nose, neck and neck right to the wire. I wouldn't listen to regardless, 44. That's up to 14%. That's probably the Schmipp people or whatever they are. What are they? Oh, that's right. I think I've got that ed, that the ed that nose picker on here America. Uh, ed shorts is named ed shorts. Right. Because I've got not seen him. Jeff the 4th, 26, the crow nine, the big, O! Has got only six. And Mohawk-Adivided is just keeping barely ahead. Keep an eye here ahead of Gildy. Mohawk's got six and Gildy five as they do cut out with the big O for last place. God is that inversing or what? Almost as embarrassing as that as I punched it up the other day. Well, I think it was yesterday. Well, I was seeing a bunch of some stories. And there was somebody called in telling Moh that he heard him on for Welsh. I guess I'm the internet three weeks ago. Or maybe the caller was just talking about for Welsh and Moses. I was, I guess, on a show three weeks ago. And many proceeds to stay was good buddy for Welsh and the back. Because the call was as Welsh or Missy might enjoy it in a Howard Stern. And Moses absolutely not. I mean, that's AAA ball for Welsh. Just AAA ball. Howard Stern is major league. You know, we're similar to that. And then turns around on the other caller I heard was talking about the dolphin season and how few games did the, the fact this was one of the cronics who's promising that the dolphins are going to win ten games are going to go ten and six this season. And since he's going to give two grand the most favorite charity. If they don't win the ten games. And Moses say, well, most experts are saying, I'll be lucky to win six or seven. Now this is the voice of the team keep in mind, okay? Right. Now granted, he's not making that prediction because that would even be more outrageous. But this is the idea that he's talking about what a cron team is going to be. This year, which is right. But the voice of the team, I mean of the jet of the dolphins. W2A and hello. Hey George, how are you? Pretty good. How are you doing? Not too bad at the amount of towns in the back a couple weeks. Good. Oh, boy. Have you listed man? Did Hank get this meal? Yeah. Wow. How are you? I'm like your Superman. I just changed him dirt to use this overnight. Just took off my put on my glasses. No, so I've been out of town. I come back and in the more hours on the afternoon and the more hours. Oh, I'm going to go to the toilet. Get it? Right. Did Hank do something to these? Did Hank move all together and we'll get this bunch thrown off the table? Well, we can talk about it on the year. I know he reported this story about Jeffrey Loria and his marriage or some vinyl. And he says that this, it was a rumor that was true in any station suspended him. And the Marlins got all been out of shape and that's as much as I can say. And so he's suspended for another one of those deals. And Moist going in. But now they're trying to make it seem like it's the more Howard David Show, which is not. I mean, I was pretty. I mean, he certainly hasn't saying hey, this is no Howard's going in for an incoming meeting. Well, let me just put it to you this way. I mean, Sturn is on now in the morning. Right. Okay. And it's a crappy version of Stern 2. Right. A chopped up butchered version. And Hank's contract ends in November. Moist got a year and a half left on his deal. Okay. So you can talk to Spanchin. You can talk about all this other window dressing. But it just, this is only my own opinion. I have no information, but it's my opinion. If you're going to pay somebody off to go away, if somebody's only got two or three months left on their deal, and then somebody's got a year and a half on their deal, being the beathies are cheaper than dirt. Who are you going to pay off to go away? Yeah. That's kind of a given. Now, what's the other thing? And you're talking about two got going over the other station. What's what's that? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Seven ninety man. Yes. PN radio. Joe Rose went over there because he got screwed over with his stern thing. And there you go. And is the fourth going over there, too? Yeah. No, the rumor is that if Hank, uh, why am I saying this? I just did say it. The rumor. Why? Yeah. Would we talk about the Motho show that they want D-Footer work with Mother, Hank, don't come back. I'll depending. D-Footer and Mother, the combination. Yeah. Yeah. It's going to be called the Motho show. I kind of like that. What's your name? I can't. I can't. What's your name? Oh, don't, don't, don't. Let's see. Joe and South Miami says, if they must put on Howard, then here's my line up. Howard, Steering, six to eleven. Neal God, 11 to three. Oh, yeah. That was a bandied about for a moment or two. And of course, there's no chance. And a mad dog's got the E2 to 4 hours. Has sensational ratings in there. I'm not messing with him. In addition, which it's a clock, I'm done. I go home. I turn around and go home. I'll put my feet. The whole driver. Mad dog's three to six is, D-Footer's six to 10. I would pick your rosebed as a TV thing. Plus he's going to be September 1st on 790 on ESPN radio. It says, absolutely. No, no, Humper. No guilty. No, no. No Lenny Martiz. And please, I beg you. No Crow. That's not the sound like a racial thing to meet on it. I got to a crow, but I'm sure you do. No Crow. I just don't have a sense of humor. And a sense of a smell, either. The crow smells like lilacs. Well, listen. He smells like, I haven't even. He takes a bath in cashmere bouquet. He's a little bit too much. Smells like hell. A lot better than many of the people I've been around lately. Oh, God. What is it with these people? Oh, I don't think casino. It's probably for the best. What does that mean? They're using all the fragrance to cover up something. No, they're not using any fragrance. Oh, those people. Yeah, well, those are the people I'm talking about. Holy crap. The people from India, the people from Italy. Yeah, love Italy. But, you know, what is that? Is that earthy kind of like hair under the armpits? Yeah, four pounds of hair. I mean, come on. And then to top it off, I'm playing the machine the other day. And there's this guy who obviously works at the track. It would be fine. And he's playing the machine next to me. You have, you have never ever in your life. Well, he's a guy who is obviously around the manure pits. Yeah. And his pits were sweaty. And you have never had any combination of aromas in your life. Overall, you're like this. And now he gets like 200 on a wheel. And I'm thinking, oh, please, please lose. I don't know you personally. I don't wish anybody to like, but please lose. And he finally just, oh, God, speak of the door. Yes, the A-list picture is up on the site. All right. Let's hear it for. Welcome. Okay. Let's hear it for ass. Can we still say that? No, well, I just did. How do you like that? Let me ask you a question. Go to Burger King Try Art. Anis steak burger. Mmm. Mmm. What kind of sauce? I don't know, but I hear it's dancing. Cheetah Cheetah. Yeah, it's a locker. In fact, I hear the beast left it there. It's a locker. Six two bands. The biggest Anis burger is the white-later-dale ever. Oh, sniff. I'll let with substance that forced authorities speaking of perfume to shut down the Fort Wayne International Airport and Fort Wayne in the NF for several hours yesterday. I've been determined to be a component used to make perfume, a fire department official said, How do you like that? Not that we're panicking or anything like that? Oh my God. The airport we open when coming flights around 130 is folksman for the Air Force Public Safety Department told CNN, American Airlines spokeswoman Lisa Bailey said, I wonder if he's kind of bill Bailey? Or maybe Jack Bailey used to be the driving champion of Vernon Downs. Or American Airlines spokeswoman Lisa Bailey said, the liquids build from a broken bottle to packet of Americans flight 4271 from Chicago's Francis O'Hare Airport. Has Matt as told us that there's no biological or chemical threat, Bailey said, Bob Amber. Or is this another Amber alert? A spokesman for the Fort Wayne Fire Department said the testing showed the liquid was a perfume ingredient, but at such a strong concentration, there was a very strong aroma he told CNN. Even the crow never smelled as fraguen he said, airport authority directed to a toy Richardson said, six people have become sick because of the spill. Two of them per medicine for airport employees. You know, there are a lot of people who have bad allergies. Right? As you know, and are allergic to heavy colon and perfume people at the see, there's two of streams. Like can people just smell like okay? You know, they have to smell great. Just like okay. Yeah. Does it God? I see. Because another curse from God is that what it is. Yeah. I think next time I go out anywhere in public. I'm going to carry a central army with less bars of coast and beat people with them. No, just start to toss out bars.

Breaking Rans with his party in reversing his earlier stance, a senior retiring Republican lawmakers said yesterday that the military strike against Iraq was a mistake, and he blasted a massive failure of intelligence before the war and, of course, he is absolutely correct. The unexpected four-page statement came from Representative Doug Beruder of Nebraska, who until earlier knew this month was the Vice Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a panel that reviewed much of the evidence the administration cited before going to war. I've reached a conclusion, retrospectively, now that the inadequate intelligence and public conclusions are being revealed, that all things being considered was a mistake to launch that military action, especially without a broad and engaged international co-hostly wrote in a four-page letter to his constituents, a scathing denunciation. The constant case release is already large and growing, and the immediate long-term financial cost are incredibly sad. Beruder was, especially, critical of the pre-war intelligence, which described an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq, but, of course, no such weapons have been found since the West Lodivation, and that's because they don't exist. Beruder voted in support of an October 2002, where it's always not rising the use of a force in Iraq, but said that the vote was based on what he had been told about the WMD threat from Iraq. Left unresolved for now is whether intelligence was intentionally misconstrued, but just if I'm a little too reactionary, said, how do you like that? Congressional Republicans were surprised in angry at Beruder's comments, you know, what to freakin' bad? How do you like that? And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, to bad. We finally found a couple of guys, including John McCain, who's pissed off him fired up until Swift vote, uh, veterans for lies or whatever that deal is, yeah. Swift vote, uh, veterans for lies ought to apologize, and even a president, even the abush my studio, right wing president, says, I'm not saying, either want to be involved. He won't, uh, renounce it. He won't, uh, reject it, he won't condemn it. And, at a course, it's just like Kerry said, today, because they're funded by a Texas military, and they're just made it. There was a bush, a bush liquor, and the whole thing is just, uh, so we can hide behind the, give the first rings of these guys, they can go out there and do the dirty work. What a filthy disgusting campaign. Come in from our draft dogs in present. You're listening to me, Rogers. Here. I'm dying over here. All we're fighting. That's your meaning. Yeah. Now, what? I didn't feel like I could survive. Yeah, but I don't have to do that. I like to survive really. I like to do that. I like to do that. I don't do that. I like to do that. I like to do that. I don't have to be all. I don't have to be all. I don't have to be all. Yeah. Yeah. Get me up. And. I like to do that. To win the fight. And to win the fight. You get me down. I like to win the fight. I like to die. I like to win the fight. I like to win the fight. Let's play the game. I'm dying over here. I can't tell whether I am dead or not. I want to die. I like to work. I like to die. I like to die. I never lose. I'm trying to move in. I'm trying to move in. I don't have to do that. Bye 就是 这二周 风ità 你 atra好像 victory now They're all around slogan greens I'm a little bit tired. I'm a little bit tired. I'm a little bit tired. I'm a little bit tired. I'm a little bit tired.

I'm taking my bed because I know If I know where your)"I tell you that I'm long, Then match your job, Your life's in my arms. Then how do I say it... I don't macro and risk you. We're around. If not, I'm speaking to Boobs a lot. Don't forget on our website, on our prestigiousnealroggies.com website, under the name of the current picture of Jamie Presley and she and Ken to Elvis. Under the picture, there's still we got all of them. Boobs a lot. Yeah. And don't forget to drag your mouse along it. Huh? Right. Drag your mouse along and do all kinds of amazing things. In addition to which we have the picture, we don't waste any time. Nice going, Eric, and by the way, the answer to your question about doing an internet show before the regular show is no chance. But anyway, the booger king of things up there. Well, that place really blows. As much as I despise McDonald's and let's have an Amsterdam because the food sucks so bad there. Unless I'm there, I would not eat there. But I would eat McDonald's a thousand times before I go to Burger King. Wouldn't you? Yeah. Well, God. Don't know seriously, it's just so bad that they don't want to eat. You can't complain about their food because they don't sell any. Is there anything they have that's good? I'll get back to you. Oh, no. I've said, no. I think that back. They do have those crocantages in the morning. That's great. It was a pretty good, yes, there. So I think after breakfast, it'd be good time for them to shut down and work out that the enus that they're working on. That, it's just a look at that thing. It's just a beautiful thing. And of course, you don't think it might be somebody like you litter with the earth. WQAM, hello. Hello there. Yes, sir. Hey, nearly, uh, lifting a couple of answers for you. I don't know if they may call, um, He's think Charlie is the one with the shirt. I still don't need to think Charlie. I wouldn't have thought of it again for 100 years, right? They used to be great down on 17th Street. Right. And, uh, then also, uh, one of three point one up here in Palm Beach is the one that carries the buzz. The buzz, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's at, uh, 96 one. That's the one over on West Coast. Oh, I said, what was it? You know, one over three point one. Why is it 93 point one? Well, I had one number right anyway. Yeah, yeah, it's a thing difference. And, uh, the only good thing at, uh, Burger King is, um, the onion rick. Oh, no. I can't believe you said that. You didn't do it so great until that moment. Well, for, for quick fix, you know. Oh, there's no onion in a man that just battered. Even the marlins ever had so many batters. This, this is, uh, it's minced onion pieces. Yeah, minced, minced is the word. But by your head, Valley, have a great day. Thanks for the info. Beef steak Charlie, you remember that? Absolutely. That was a good place. Wasn't bad at all. You know, and then, uh, all these people say, oh, when you're just an old fart living in the past, even young farts like Georgia was meddled. Of course, uh, Josh, you probably don't remember beef steak Charlie doing. Nah, never heard of it. Don't think so. You didn't even remember lumps. Yeah. Or wags. I don't care what anybody says. Also wags was damn good for what it was. Right. I mean, where would you rather go like it to 11 o'clock in night or one in the morning? Wags or dines? No, carcest. No, come for eye hop. Man, oh, man. Have you ever noticed driving around? No matter where you are in America, you drive around. And you see all of these rave from it. You're looking buildings that used to be in international house of flakes. You know, you're, I mean, that design they here and now almost all of them. Thank goodness, there's something else. You know, I think I can really remember about international house of cakes, which, unfortunately, was a sponsor once upon a time. And I did a lie a lot. I'm sorry. But, uh, you know, all those different kinds of, uh, sir, syrup, that's it. Blueberry syrup and blackberry and poisonberry and poisonberry and, and they were, kind of. Huh? They were a week anyway. Yeah. Yeah. And they sucked. But I mean, they had like 85,000 different kinds of syrup to shmere all over whatever you got. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. I'm not getting all my stuff in here today because it's already almost. Wait. Oh, I can't handle this. And Christ, I gotta come back and do another show next Tuesday. Oh, you know, something the party's almost over. Boy, it's your goes by fans. Yeah, I don't it goes by fans. I don't know. This is your line August deal every summer. Man. Because this week is the last week of the, uh, two weeks. Oh, we go back to that regular schedule. Yeah. Or they're going to have to put up with me every day Monday if you're Friday briefly after we finish with the Howard Stern and Boba Tumerathon. A church year loved his story from Milwaukee. A church elder was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. Yeah, two day for abusing an 80 year old autistic two and a half years is all they got. For abusing an 80 year old autistic boy who died what prosecutors called and exorcism and a stir front church. I mean, you're like that. Yes, I'm looking for it. Trust me. Well, now that we got these new, uh, IDs and all the accused and every I got to be, I've got to mind my piece of cues. Prosecutors say very himpily on Terence, Cockrell's chest released an hour. Oh, that's what definitely is doing to Robert Greaver this morning is what I heard. Don't get off this. That's the room we're going around the building. Well, he's under a lot of pressure. You know what all in dumps? He lay on his chest, at least an hour. I'll try to release demons from him before the boy died August 22,000. On theory, buddy. It was your unreasonable and reckless conduct because this child that I Milwaukee County Circuits judge Jean Demarot told himpill last month, the Dree found himpill 46 guilty a physical abuse of a child, recklessly causing great bodily harm. Himpills attorney at our unit is fine. I was trying to help the boy and that controlled died after an overdose of medication. The medical examiner ruled the boy out of suffocation. Terence, side of the Faith Temple Church in Episolic Faith of the Ampisolic Faith in Milwaukee where Himpill was a church elder and where the boy and his mother were members. The church also sentenced and pilled a seven and a half years of extended supervision. Ordered himpill about $200 in Ryan Ryan's restitution and will not allow him to appear in that new exercise this movie coming out this fall. You to realize that the peak will is coming? Yes. Why do we do that? The sequel, the sequel, I mean the sequel is so bad it's just an abomination man. The other father is Rodigan, held because of that. There were two of them and the one with Richard Burton that was the old time or if that was just a grotesque. But now we got the excess of the prequel. Maybe it might be pretty good. I will turn your head around as well. Is it under Blurghead or be in it? No. She's not? No. How do we know that? We know that. What is that coming out of? I don't know. I actually, I've actually found out a lot about the evil doers. Wasn't that supposed to be in Iran the first scene? Yes, Persia. Which is like I said. I read it right. 20, let's just go kill him all. Okay, let's kill everybody before we get us. You know, they want us. We're going to go with them. 26 past noon at five, 60. It's 12, 30 already. We got to get out of here. Almost. Ha ha ha ha. And the audience just saying, Daniel, what are you laughing about here? Well, it's just one of those things. You know, in fact, now if you figure out the hourly, Georgian Josh has moved up almost to a woman in the wage. So what's wrong with that? Yeah.

Throw them in the car. Oh! 32-560WM-Happy Thursday, two-year. 501-Posts. Rending this pool right now. Look how it ends. Who would you most like to hear an afternoon drive 4-7 in the PM on WQAM? Hank Goldberg. Oh, I should point out to you. I just checked the QM schedule again. Between 4-7, it says the Hank Goldberg show. How do you like that? Now they are. Hank, 155, and said 163. How would most of you regardless, 70, 14%. Do you have to force 50? What are how many of those were voting from the Mica Sufis? The crow's got 16. The big O has got 16. And second wind in the last and next to last place, that morning team, or at least that former morning team, two guys that just despise each other like poison, a mole Howard David has got 13 and Steve Yaldi Gelsen's only got eight. Oh, brother. Pretty weak. Lane. Here's the appul for the rest of the show and through the day. President, he'll pull. Once the last time we did this quite a while ago, right? About a month or so. And I hate to write the news to you, but it's already August number 19, which means the election is to... It's a couple months away, right? September, October. Just two and a half months. Gonna be here before you know it. Let me say it also. Kerry is leading a Bush in Ohio 52 to 42 among all registered voters. Among likely voters, he's only three points. North Carolina Bush has only had by three points as John had, which is making a little bit of a splash there. So give me chance to play that. I think that's the most of the sucks on this guy. It really is bad. Bush 48, in fact, I would think that might be something that we can't play when he's from right now. Forty-eight. Kerry, too bad mommy to run. She could identify. Kerry 45 in North Carolina. A lot of closer than I'm sure the Bush people would have to see. President Trump pulled who would you vote for? Bush, Kerry, later. I won't vote or I can't vote. I'm not eligible, which means either you're too young. Or you just got off the bit animal like Georgia or for a month or two to reach. Did I leave anything off? That... No, no, they can vote in date. Oh, the date people can vote in dead. No question about that. In fact, the more the better as long as they wrote vote for Kerry. Yeah, we're gonna bring in a whole bunch of dark folks from outside. We're gonna bring in a bunch of dead people. We're gonna send in Ziggins and Ziggins of Fony, Fc and T-Mellas. You think you guys stole the election last time. You ain't seen nothing yet. We're gonna...we're gonna have people that have been dead for a thousand years. We're gonna have like the founding fathers are gonna be voting again. Noobie obtained military records of one of Senator John Kerry's most vocal critics who is accused of the Democratic presidential candidate of lying about his wartime record with medals. Contradict is on very different events. How do you like that? What a surprise, huh? What a bunch of lying. What a sack of craft man. Talk about desperate. Desperate. In newspaper interviews and a bestselling book, Larry Thurlow, who committed the Navy's swift vote alongside Kerry and Vietnam, has strongly disputed Kerry's claim that the Massachusetts Democrats vote team under fire during a mission in Vietnam controlled territory on March 1369. Kerry won a bronze star for his actions that day, but there are all military records, personally which will release yesterday the Washington Post on the Freedom Information that contained several references to enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire directed at all units of the five vote float Tila. No connection to the famous Freedom float Tila. See, Thurlow won his own bronze star that day and the citation phrases him for providing assistance to a damaged swift vote despite enemy bullets flying about a mess in his own citation. How do you like that? Lire, liar, your pants around fire, Larry, and all of you other pharbicitor goi them out there. It's just shocking. And let me ask you one further question about all these things. Yeah. What is Vietnam happy to do with anything now anyway? Oh yeah, right, look. See, even if he didn't, even if there wasn't gunfire, where's Thur was, but even if there wasn't, at least he was there. Right. He signed up. He didn't have. He enlisted. Nobody had a drag him kicking and screaming. He enlisted. He showed some balls, big ones. As opposed to our draft dodging vice president, four times he was a five. Otherwise occupied. I think five times I'm sorry. And of course, our A-wall president who pulled some strings just like he's recorded to stay in there in the movie in Fahrenheit. A pulled some strings from daddy and his friends, some connections to get into the good national gardens that are putting his life on the line. And then he even couldn't show up when he was supposed to. What a joke. How is it possible to be so stupid? It's right there in front of you. And I'm going to tell you one of the main reasons. The main reasons that the public is there stupid. The media is sick and they pop badly. It's incontinentable. You great robbers and there's that wolf club in a blue screen right now. Study this over. I studied this. You idiot. You Nazi bastard. You bearded jerk. You jackass. 560, 560, pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. So the other pull lines I would hate. Aging out Rick and Suds. But Rick and Suds still pretty popular with our audience. I'd be telling you that right now. And of course, if we put Rick and Suds on. Oh my god. Can you hear the National. The Sports and Barry Jackass and Jim Sarni would be running around with picket signs outside the building there. The Sports nerds would be peeing. Oh, one other call I heard on Moe Vio today. One that we'd like four or five. I did listen for about five minutes. Because he was written for where we're just. I thought we were really a stab in a back. Guy calls after last. And this is what set me diving to the other room. Guy calls him up to ask him about how come the dolphins on 3rd and 33 did such and such in an exhibition game. The other day. I mean, is that incredible or what? Talking about Sports, my news show in a meaningless exhibition game. Anybody who's involved with this crack to that. You definitely need a lobotomy man. I have no right. Give me a break. Speak of the credible. Yes. A bow-gryphan or the TV on good day live. Remember our friend. Oh, good boy. Yes. Triple-dense. Oh no. And you want to know why Chris got his punchinger for bitching out our good friend Joe Costello. Oh, and Joe Costello, by the way, did you mention it? Yes, indeed I did. Let's go to him yesterday about it. Congratulations. Hi, Scott, Joe. He's doing the NASCAR, the racing stuff on is it next time or serious. It's XM. On XM, I'm ready. So you've got to EC as we speak, bro. Casting from there. Excellent. So Steve, here's another guy who's going to escape QAN. And of course, you remember those days when Greg was saying, oh, I want to bring back Joe Costello with Moanema. And I'll grab you talk so much crap. Man, in fact, said Greg Reed out for lunch, you'll probably go straight to Burger King after he finishes with his suit sheet place to go to Burger King for some of them Anis burgers. No, Steve, that's just spatially. Crap. He's the crap master. Well, let's see, speak on a crap. Let's take a look at that presidential pool. Not the greatest choice in the world. That's for Dan Schuer. 36 votes on there on the very first flash. Well, we got a big response. Man, over five, was that correct over 500 votes on the first pool? Yeah. We only came on my 10 minutes ago. By the way, anything else, Robin? That seriously, I just, I can't find. And you didn't, I'm sure you wouldn't know you did here because you said you were in a car. You would take it right into the airport. Right. And the show on Tuesday, I don't know about Monday because I didn't hear it. But the show on Tuesday was so unbelievable because we kept having them settle like the problems, which, by the way, the good news is the ABC people sent us a whole bunch of new stuff and the satellites, just a couple of dropouts I guess this morning. I'm told. Right. But between the bleeps and then the dropouts and Tommy's heavy metal music that came in are over, it was, I'm surprised we don't have any 5000 right to life of protesters marching outside our building because it was the biggest abortion known to mankind. We didn't believe it. Anything else? President of the pool, if the election were right now, who'd you vote for? 38 votes, carry 31, bush four. I can't vote in that eligible one. One vote one and neither one. You people out there and notice that, how about a lot more than one? You people are going to vote for NATO again. I'm telling you right now, if you go to bed with a conscience after you cash that moment, it's got to be a miracle. You've got to be some kind of a moron.

I don't want to. Well, he's your new, uh, big-o for Jeff Hrem. Who is announced yesterday. Oh, this, Dr. Wood, at the talks to his teeth, and I can't stand him. Well, we have to remember to him. So, I guess, well, first of all, he may be going to be any season anyway, so I wouldn't be worried about any time real soon. That's true. I guess he had no other choice being that he has to be in. It's cutting their games back in half, so he was a third guy with a yes fan. So, I'm not a big fan of his. He was the right wings and I was to be free when he has to be in. Right. Why? I just want to keep you that bit of news. And, uh, Greg's still at you. Okay. Thanks. And the feeling is, uh, well, I wouldn't say I hate him. I just, um, embarrassed him. He humiliated and degraded for him. So, I just want to say, uh, man, such an oozing piece of vermin. 560560, pound 560, here's line nine. WQAim Hello. Yeah, sir. But they're my pleasure. Okay. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Those are always my favorite. WQAim Hello. I'm six. That's real fire six. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, just want to make it come back. Go running in. Come on.

Hi, man. How you doing? Okay. Now, I'm fully in agreement with all you people. Those normal people against this crazy crazy business we got going on. I'm a local businessman. I want to tell you something. I have employees. I've been playing. I've made $0.30 grand a year. And I'm not 30 man. Not 30. And they, you know, when they had, they came to me last year. Oh, we're getting this tax break. We're getting this tax break. You know what I'm going to call. Let me tell you something. I do my own taxes. And the difference on their pay attention. The withholding taxes. $1. $1. Wow. And that the end of year may be a $200 thing. So they got about $250 a year. These people that are struggling at 30 grand a year. And I read somewhere where you made a million dollars a year. Your tax break was $750 something. $1,000. Holy disgusting. Well, what would it mean? If you made a million dollars, your tax break was $750,000? Yeah. No. So $75,000. I'm sorry. $75,000. That's right. I'm getting excited. I'm going to start getting excited too. I mean, this is just shame. I wanted to end another thing. There's, I don't know if you know anything about business. But what you do have a, there's a deduction that you can take right off the top of your taxes as a business owner. Right. Well, the section 179. And what I two years ago, which was $14,000, I think. So year before this was $24,000. And this year, for last year, fact went up to 200,000. That's basically stop easy money. That's money that you can buy, whatever you want. And take it without having to depreciate the value of that item. No, that weren't just free money for the rich. Right. Scott. Well, unless you're rich, unless you're rich, you're a fundamental survivor, we're religious, not wine and won't be able to vote for these Nazis. That's not quite good. I don't know. I don't know, but I'm doing okay. I'm comfortable. But I just hate to see the people and the people who make a less money get to watch like this. And then, oh, Scott. And the people are voting for him. The ones that are getting squads. Scary. Now, that's the scariest part. Wow. That's because maybe it's like the punishment. Good luck to Paliacia to Poland. Thank you. All right. See it's a big poll. We'd see George at the poll, but he can't vote because he's in the legal alien. See, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8. Maybe we can bring alien back to vote sounds good. And sister Jean, the dancing machine. Did she die or die dream that? Ah, she didn't die. Did she? I don't know. I think maybe she died. Huh? I can't believe that you don't know what she died or not. She died? Well, that's what I'm thinking. Josh has googled it right there. Google up full sister Jean. What was your last name? Jean, oh, the queen. Jean McLaughlin. Oh, the whole offlin sounds off the arrow. Oh, the main thing. You might say about the arrow. WQA, hello. Any are you doing sir? Pretty good. Great. It's you know that in the morning man. You're chronic man. You're too chronic. I don't want to talk to you. I don't know. I can't handle his voice. He's just annoying. It's one thing to be chronic. But it's something to be chronic with annoying voice. You're just man. You need to get a voice transplant. You get somebody to give you a new box. Because he must be he must have learned sightest. Don't you agree? I mean, I find him unacceptable. There's a, I'm not playing that game anymore. Okay. If you want to find your, get yourself a room at the holiday in rent like a little uh, one of those conference rooms. Get about 15 year or best friends and enemies and pickups and strangers on a street corner. Put them in there and you can do a show for them. I'm not interested in chronic. Okay. Whether it's one from a little Havana. Whether it's that laughing idiot. I'm hanging in that calls you all the time. Uh, see. And let me let me straight out once and for all. Okay. Gilbert. It isn't yours. That don't want you on a show. It's me. It's yours. Troy. I wouldn't want you on. If you paid me a million dollars a second. You're simple. Then you idiot. So put on those goofy Google vases. You're not going to get lost. Doesn't that groovy a Google eyes? Yeah, two of them. Maybe that baby Davis. I'm still in home. Hope bottle glasses. Can't spend much of Gilbert or Betty Davis. Something to think about. How's that pull coming? Who would you vote for if you had a chance to vote right now? What if I had a chance I'd vote over and over again while I weren't looking? 1609 votes. Carry 132. 78.1%. Voice 23. 13.6%. I won votes six. Nader 5. Nader 5. 3%. That could swing it. Man, dover than a box of rocks you need or people. Stubborn, dumb, and you know who they're just like? Who? Nader. 20. Rockers.

Our David's a bit That's a movie He's why we're so alien, ow Looks like the micro-sni- Now's from the mighty home Robert Bush and Bonnie Bell and I both otherwise not bow It's not the point he realized He raised for criminal clown Robert Bush and Bonnie Bell and I And he kept me holding crap me And he raised for five And that he kept a trusty And said, that great skill I made while he said they want no more What's like he's married him and only falling between a side and half But he's held me down He doesn't need to fall out I've been seeing all my sister's lies That's what the window might seem soft But for a Bush and Bonnie Bell and I He made a short point and kept for each That's a nice and big movie Robert Bush will be rich in fat And smell just like a magic song Robert Bush read that one's name is for nine hundred dead David Marry family Once 17 560 WCOM anything else I love that song by the way I'm not a fan of the song I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way I'm not a fan of the song by the way This issue is working as a part that we use now Though remember in the beginning It's like everybody else It's great idea. And the feelings you use when you want to remain Your friends ask to respond to me And you are one of us kind of grew up to say It's a great idea to have choices wall separating their activities in budget from general corporate control. This was necessary to provide independent reporting for the news division, but one of the network's news cancers Howard Beale had literally gone crazy and become a subject of great entertainment while he was broadcasting the news. It's quite a busy sanity that our continued to use and because the ratings went through the roof. The head of the news division played by William Holden was fired, and there never was to be a Chinese wall again separating news from corporate control. That work has now become the standard for news in American. It's destroying our democracy. America's now being terrorized every day by the corporate media that profits from such cheap and heartless use of reporting news to the public and in doing this, they're not reporting the truth about the world this nation and the current administration. They're now aligned exactly with the government and trust to keep the public terrorized, so it's to control the people more effectively. The corporate media sells more advertising, makes more money and is now the lackdog of the powerful and elite in government. The current administration is used to press as effectively as was done in Nazi Germany in spite of our constitutional government. There's no need for a dictatorship. There is no competition that can effectively able the media market to prevent this strangle hole under the Semination of News in America. Although air America is a start to providing wield this course and alternative news in America, there's only one way to make the corporate own media change and Howard Beale the crazy anchor man in network gave us the words to do it. The climate matters now, but it's not clear to me. Sheldon Drabney says I want everyone to go to their windows open and scream out. The climate matters now, but it's not clear to me. Or words to that effect. Since we can't all do that at the same time, the reason effectively to fight the media and to make news that is useful and formative and somewhat independent. People who are upset with these media drives have to stop watching them until they change. Get your families together and start talking to each other. Read books or listen to CDs and alternative forms of entertainment, writer by videos. Watch the history channel or the food channel. Do anything but not watch CBS and B.C. ABC, Fox, CNN, MSNBC or any of their affiliates. I think they already took them up on the MSNBC part. It's a very small sacrifice to save your country. Our fighting men and a rack of sacrifice. Their lives and families to fight this illegal war, then independent media could have prevented. It's a very small sacrifice, but if you're really care and participate, the media giants will have no choice but to change. They'll be on their knees, begging for the liberals that they demonize so much to start watching again. And the liberal audience is the most lucrative for the Networks in spite of how terrible we're treated. The audience is the John Stuart David Letterman group that Networks are so hungry to get. The Republicans always try to will lure the African American vote by saying that the Democrats take their vote for granted. Well, liberals let's tell the media that they're demonizing us and taking us for granted. Let them start appealing to us instead of the bigots and racist that they think are so important to their survival. I'm convinced that this will work because all major media companies are only profit driven. Let's organize and pick a week to stop watching the Networks. All the liberal and progressive media groups should have a solidarity campaign, much like the unions do in the group against industry giants such as the auto industry. We could all protest in every major city with signs that say, or as mad as hell, that's the only way we can get them where it hurts so the networks will stop at last, biting the hand that feeds them. So let's not fight the administration in their own briar patch. We have to accept the fact that the way to get these rats out is to attack the media, attacking the administration's waste of time, I think, and still control the media, control the media is the only way that a government can survive. Now it's time for the people to have an intervention against the corporate media, not their constitutional government of buy and for we the people. Pretty garcled by children's robinies. They have a very important work sucks. I mean, damn good article. Yeah, that's right. If it's done work, it's as good as you're, it'll be kicking ass. But anyway, don't waste the out, frank and show. He's pretty exciting. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT and C and Verizon. You know, it's interesting to think about the steering people like that car we had about a half hour ago. Yeah. It's the same thing. It's all part of the same ego. There's nobody else on the year. Nobody else is any good. No, even though the guys listening though of course, right, then I guess only by accident. What do you do for the hour? Like we must be listening and enjoying it. To grind. The fact we don't have a reason we got Josh Curtis in there serving your punishment. Right. Because he is do's. He is doing his dues by being forced to listen so we get some idea when to hell or go. We're going to get done already when we come on the year. And we were busy talking and they'll pay no attention to it. I hate to break the news, do's sir. Fiance here on the second strings.

No ego and a show. 560, 050, 50, 50, pound, five, 60 on the AT and C and Verizon, Marvus Line. WC, lamb, hello. Hey, Neil. How are you? Pretty good. I just heard this in the story. I just watched the news on the other. They're filming the dirt. And they were showing a two-cop shot shot from this guy who was... Penifile. Penifile? Penifile. Who was a pedophile? Right. And what happened? He was to meet me. They just came right in and they just born the house and he just happened to a shot on my there. Well, I mean, it's on the, I read it on the Sun Center, but it just happened this morning. I can't give you all the details. No, okay. Then I just heard a two-cop shot shot out of the room. Right, and why one of them is dead? One on his dead. I'm pretty sure. And I'll, I'll detect the story out again. Somebody's dead. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, if you see it? No, but sister, Jean is not dead. Oh, sister Jean is not dead. Jean is retired. That's the story. I gotta play that. Can I play that? Play that way? Yes, that's what I'm saying. And then we got to bleed.

One brow chair of self-hissivity was killed another wounded while working with a kiddie porn had to pass for a stri-to-surgery service search warrant this morning, a suspect is in custody police and fire rescue officials said. I mean, of course, with our vast news resources here at QAM, this guy's stressed me to have all the information about all the details on that. Wouldn't you think? No, I don't think. I mean, now that we actually have more than one show on here that isn't just a sports show, it didn't work in having any news. Oh, well, that's right. Robin, give us the news, I forgot.

You know what I mean? And there's no time that you come on. Yeah. So I mean. I was saying that to George before they showed it. I mean, I'm happy to be working less. But for example, if you have a favorite TV show, which was your just for it yesterday, how would it be if you had no idea what time it came on? If you had a attorney? I mean, how many people would actually be watching it if they never knew what time it started? Yep. And that's the thing that's just an a lot of your fans go up that don't like Howard, because they, you know, we're waiting for you and we keep flashing back important. Yeah. We must hear. The way that this was done was a total lack of respect for the listeners of this program. I mean, I could give a crap less. But for the audience that we've gotten bill over seven years, just a total lack of respect by Greg Reed for the annual Rogers audience, which says why. Yeah. Between 10 or 11 o'clock, I'm going to keep flipping back and forth and I keep telling anything else. I'm going to throw that for an all-power. Anything else? Yeah. All right. How much is that?

Don't say don't say Don't say janir we know I don't think I think she and janir on their separate ways janir got in that red pickup By the way one other thing I noticed it the wood vine casino a lot of dikes what is that all about they like to gamble to of course a lot of the British and Canadian women you know they got those butcher cuts right well plus the fact that there's so many I heard they like to flaunt a lot Anything else President Bush is I'm just gonna escape right along okay President Bush's full-term effort to court you as sure Americans has failed It's failed boy according to a new poll that you're in training center to John Kerry among those voters in the race for president by 53 percentage points This is the message from Jewish America to George W. Bush, Castle Huis We worked at the Bush administration has done over the last three years to reach out to Jewish voters has been largely unsuccessful said post your an agreed verbal conducted the poll for the national Jewish Democratic Council what better name could you have that an agreed bird Most of your curate the Democratic nominee leads bush 75 to 22% among Jewish voters That's 4 percentage points less than the 79% that exit poll said was one by the 2000 Democratic ticket of Al Gore and Senator Jew Leaverman Of course it doesn't mention here how many blame they lost because Leaver Moon was on the ticket Especially in the south this comes despite Mr. Bush being what one Republican called the best friend that is real is ever had in the White House Big deal and describe for a certain the other parts of the local out research is an official White House Menor lighting ceremony and a Khanica party this past December. I bet you even a respond the drill Can you see it Which end this also fits it up an ironic double win because poll show Mr. Kerry also leading among Arab Americans as well a big switch For Mr. Bush's overwhelming success with that block in 2000 The new poll shows a different support from last year with an American Jewish Council full-fond bush with 31% now It's just 22. There's one Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter 1980 is one less than 64% of the Jewish vote since exit polling pose the question beginning in 1972 Of course Jimmy Carter he was a yeah, he's a glacier cup from a plain's Georgia. What do you expect peanut farmer and Nixon? Who is good for Israel? See a work back then that's what they used to say Nixon was good for Israel Yeah, they find that the two topics that most use care about way above his real is the economy and the Iraq and Warren terrorism How do you like that what a concept all Let's have some more illegal settlements what do you say five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT and T and Verizon line here's our presidential pool so far We got four under votes for all one. It's not bad. We'll talk in an hour and 45 minutes and by the way, it's almost to a clock anything else deal oh Yeah, Kerry's got 127 votes 81 and a half percent bush 46 11 and a half percent I won't vote 13 Nader eight one point nine percent if you're a little bit better because leaders got less than two percent see what I'm saying I think I don't know I think he got I've been out to because I could be wrong. We're like about three percent last time in Florida And two points six percent nationwide Can you get much but he got enough to screw it all up right? Egotistical pop is old washed up ass Say them to Orlando to that burger king Think they have washed up as there. I hope they're watching I can't vote him out.
