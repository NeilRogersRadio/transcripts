She was born November 12, 1954, so that makes her almost 50, another couple months. Her measurements as Miss Luzian, a 35, 22, 35 and then in 1997, I guess she was growing girl 36D, 25, 36 not to be confused with triple 34C or whatever she went. Always, I don't want to go into it. Here's her biography. Boy, it goes on that long. She's been in a few things, but on TV, she's been all over the place including the Howard Spurmshow. Silk stockings? Remember how much I liked that show a lot? Yes indeed. What was his name? I don't know. Ask Rita. But anyway, her movies, Prisoner Go Go, Love Bites TV series.

Here's a very disturbing story. I guess I'll give today's poll right now. Okay? I. WQAM Hello. Hey Neil, how you doing? Pretty good sir. Did you have it? I noticed where the movie trap came from. The website is on the bottom there. I didn't see that. It's Mo Howard David's favorite. MilkyPirateDice.com. All right. Another day in Paradise. Thank you so much. Don't, don't, don't, don't. I don't forget, Scott, your mouse along our booby trap. Yeah. The reason I keep repeating that, I'm sure you do too. It's because a lot of guys probably are like clicking on here. And I see one that's pretty interesting. But you know, we guys all the fun they can have with it by clicking their mouse. It's, it's rective. Drag your mouse right along that row above all the rows. And then put it back in the house. Exactly. Put the mouse in a house. Which of these people here today's poll do you think is or was the most despised softwater personality of all time? You know what inspired me for the poll? I give up. Well, don't you remember on Tuesday I mentioned the Rikki Tiki Sanchez as departing will show when over like a sliced hollow off an earth poll. Right? And he's gone again for the umpteen time. Bye bye, Rikki. Rikki Tiki Sanchez only cast an over time joker. The only one's in town to keep kissing his ass. They must have something going. Anyway, most despised softwater personality of all time. Radio TV newspapers. In other words, personality can include a lot of territory. So I got on a poll for a start. Rik Sanchez and then for the old timers out there, Alan Courtney, who was a did talk radio in this town for about a hundred years. But uh, became the most just obnoxious crummudgeon. You know, you never heard him, did you? I heard you talk about him. That's all more actually heard him. Hmm. Nasty, meme old man. I mean, of course, I can understand a little bit of that when you do talk in South Florida for many, many years. Not good man. He was longer than that. He was the pioneer. No question about that. But he was a miserable old son, bitch. But uh, I can understand it gets to him. South Florida, Tazutendancy, like a make you like that. Like that. Yeah. As opposed to friendly and civilized, like some other places that I might be sitting in right now. What a cute old man today at it is a walk solid out there. Look for the QM van today at 11 o'clock this morning at the Shell Station. A bit of a grill will be there. You're probably sure you'll share with me some of my Marlin tickets.

It is Pistora O'Reilly. It's one show you won't want to miss and corroborate one. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Rick's and just sings. He loves his audience. I accept you as a precious gift from Tom. That's all because we don't have a lot of competition on there. We'll get a whole bunch of names on here. There are many people they despise. They hate like poison. But so far the first 37 votes. Rick's and just 31. Spookies to rate. That was your choice. Good choice. Alan Courtney's got a pair. And I voted on the only vote on her so far for somebody that I intended to put on there. And somebody didn't waste any time. And in fact, she and then Greg, we'd been to the Budeil. Greg Budeil. Most of our audience probably don't even know who that is anymore. Because he's been in between the country pantry there and Hollywood. Huh? I'm sorry. That's in between the tables and cleaning toilets at the country kitchen in Hollywood, where my used to live. He's been on like some low-watch stations. How many why? Not good man. He's been around. Although I said he is. Rock solid. No question about that. So I voted for him because I don't want to make him feel left out because then he'll get paranoid about that. Although who am I to talk about people screw up in the head? I didn't realize I was screw up in head until the last week. How do you like that? In a week and a half, I've lost seven and a half pounds. Oh, right. How do you like that? And the audience is out there. Oh, why do you have done this a million times? You fat tub. You'll see? Even I know it because the key for me is I just don't ever have the assurker cravings. They're all that stuff. All these things. No, no, don't have them. Don't need any big meals. Just a graze a little bit. Maybe some cheese over here. Or maybe some bacon this morning for breakfast. And you know some stuff a little bit here a little bit there. That's it. Instead of sitting down to those big heart-throbbing meals that just tear your kishki's out. And making a gigantic oozing painful bowel movements like a mump would say. It's just seven and a half pounds and a week and a half pretty good for me. Yeah, you'll take. And then duck, I told you that this voice is, well, what are you on? The heck is it? I should have said something to me like you're on something. No, seriously. I'm not on anything. I'm on the common sense saved your life by it. Derell Miller in Minneapolis didn't make it to airport security because he couldn't keep his pants on. Airport police had a security screener was waving a metal detecting wand over Miller's inside. When Miller pulled his shirt down it was ankles the only problem is he wasn't wearing any underwear. Miller then said, there, how do you like your job? Thus ending the screening quite in a police report he would charge with an decent exposure released on $300 bail. We've never had anybody do that before said Air Force Police Air Force Police Lieutenant Matt Christensen, but it's not a normal for people to become frustrated with the screening process. In other words, he probably is wondering why are you waving your wand over my genital area? Miller also became belligerent during the screen. In fact, they found out one thing about him. He was rock solid. He became belligerent during the screening TSA officer told police. One TSA employee also told police that Miller had a note inside a magazine in his bag with an explodiment told a TSA employee. Oh yeah, it's for you when asked who that was directed at. In other words, uh, f*** you. You probably give him the old dick chaining. Let's get to more names than I'd pulled before we start to hopping in an alas crap. I got piled up here, okay? Lots of crap. All the crap all the time. George tells me there's nothing going on. Well, check. Check. Check. Check. She. WQM hello. J. J. J. Yes sir. Hey, hey, hey, don't. I got you just for a bowl. Yes sir. All cash are no balls. All right, good one. Thank you, Kelly. All right, buddy. Cash are no, but he just asked on there right away. Cash is coming to town. Anybody know that? Really? It's a miracle. I don't understand who these people are out there. And quite frankly, I don't want to know them. The sports nerds. I don't want to know them from them. I don't want to know not to bottom. Mad Dog get to the huffer at four. We got a fairly pristine schedule. We got the very rock solid. Big. That's seven tonight for three upon. We're showers. Any K10. Nice to have pristine schedule. And then of course, uh, we got Marlon's. Let's see. They're playing the pirates tomorrow. Am I right about that out of town? Stop new Josh. What's that? I said, shang. Oh, yeah. Oh, a judge before we take any more calls. A judge ruled this week that a proposed politically motivated billboard. This is a little follow up on a story we had on Tuesday. By the group project billboard that was blocked by clear channels. Spectacular division in Marriott hotels was a contract to spewed and not directly involving the first amendment. Damn it. Spectacular were channeled 70 plus displays in Times Square and for Marriott hotels rejected the design last week. Project billboard and anti-war group has been charging the media giant. Cheap channel but you're great robbing bastards with blocking the erection of it. Oh, can't say that no more of the, uh, of a billboard that depicts an illustration of a cartoonish bomb. Drakewood stars and stretch the company by the words democracy is best taught by example, not by war. The ad was to appeared on the facade of the Marriott Marchi hotel on Broadway August 2 November 2, meaning the display would be up during the Republican National Convention starting August. We're Manhattan through November presidential election and I got you out of here. So there you go. Bad news there. It's just a contractual dispute and I could nothing do with freedom of speech is what the judge said. Line 9, WQAM hello. New York. Yes sir. Glen Hill. Glen Hill? Yeah. Was the spiced? Uh, wasn't Glen Hill the bird? Yeah. Well, put him down here. Okay. I think what you're trying to say is I hate the bird. Okay. Glen Hill. I'm not proud to see parentheses put the bird. Okay.

How can we forget my friends? How to sit out of mind? Okay. Palli. To the choices. Thank you so much. Or nearly we just say one, but I'm in such a good mood. Seven and a half pounds. I think I was telling George before the show. I think about another couple of months. I'm going to be able to throw away a lot of that medication. I've been taking it. It's probably going to shorten my life tremendously. If I keep taking it. No matter what kind of drugs you're taking boys and girls. And I'm not suggesting. Please understand that you throw your drugs down the turtle unless of course there are illegal substances. But any here and knock on the door. But other than that. Man. Get off of the drugs if you can because they be bad for you. And now this new stuff for the cholesterol. Oh yeah. You really. Now we want to get your cholesterol numbers way down there. We want them to be rock solid. Right. We want your cholesterol to be like three. Just more hype more BS. Somebody's getting paid off again by all these. What do they call these drugs? I can never think of that name. Staten. Staten. Very good. I was thinking of acne-staten myself. I was thinking of staten. And I was thinking of staten drugs. So core and lipitor and Pramacol. All that crap. Vadfria, baby. Badfria. Which reminds me of that book again by Macauley Komer. What's his name? Great book. No, not if you're reading it because you don't read nothing but it's a great book. WQAM. Hello. New? Yes sir. Hey what's happening? How you doing? I've got two for the ball. Two. Okay. Go ahead. He's got a pair. And there we are. Alien. Alien. Alien Gonzalez. Okay. Thank you. In fact, wouldn't surprise me if we get several members of the Gonzalo's family on there before we be done. Wouldn't like mirrors. We see as people like that. But we'll wait. We don't want to rush to judgment doing. And don't be saying rush because he ain't a South Florida. He does live in Palm Beach. He has a home near and he's got some good drug to supply his there. And doctors too. South Florida. What? Which of these people do you think is the most despise South Florida personality of all time. Dead or alive. Radio TV newspapers, billboards, a pop-tents, street-quarter. Oh yeah, Sean can only. If anybody knows who that is. We hate you Sean. If I don't make it out of our face. I don't know.

Oh, we got a car here. Hello. How sad it is. I had a dump that. I'm sure you probably did too. Yeah, and you know what reminded me. I heard that those two words together. On air America this morning at 804. Yeah. On that show. I was telling you about. They actually said. They just say it. They said it loud and strongly. See that's where I heard. I mean, there are several things that this company has just gone way overboard. Because we have emotionally crippled middle-level management people at WQAM. As a result, they've gone way overboard. What you can't say there's, and you can't do that. You can't go like middle-range break. I can't do anything. And I think that the. The ag and fact. There are two of them. One begins with an S right. Right. Correct. Which includes the word scum, which we can say scum on here. But we can't say scum in conjunction with another word. I have to learn to full of it. Right. And then of course the old doosh, you can do show your problems away. But you can't do a. Right. Oh, God. So sad. So pathetic. So childish. So spinyless. And in fact, I had a dump that. I want the GD. Don't forget that. It would charge you. You've been saying that for, you know. Oh yeah. Right. In fact, not only can we say. Fuck. Or any more. We can't even say. The letter. Right. You know what I mean? A. Hold him in ground. Could be dangerous if you're dripping. Right. So that's just a little bit of what we have to contend with. But you know something. We shall overcome. We don't care because we want to check. Baby, that's all we care about. Just give us show us the money. Show us the money and all the rest. You can stick it right away to Mundo and shine. Okay. Right. Then you. Yeah. We just can't tell you where. Right. Now we can. We can draw you a picture. But we say it. Or we can stick our foot there to give you an indication. We don't know what stuff might enjoy it. Which in these people do you think is the most despise out for a personality radio TV to live your dead of all time? Rick Sanchez. I'm going to tell you 105 votes. If you aren't near your computer, we can't see this result. You may be shocked. Are you sure? By these things. Pretty staggering. 81. At 77.1% of our first 105 votes say they despise Rick Sanchez more than anybody. He's ever come down. You'll hike. That's with a p. Stokees deraise Godnein. And interesting. Both of them have worked or did work or do work in her case on channel 7. Right. The amazing how many people watch channel 7 but they lie about it. They pretend they don't.

Sanchez 102, shookies the rate ten, Mo Howard David and six. I don't think he can beat Rick. No. No, because well, don't be too sure. Because Rick got off to a huge start. He's like 100 yards ahead. But what's more gets up a full head of steam or full head of here? He's on the 10 day vacation. I asked this morning our operations mangleer. I asked my flint miss Lindsay. I said is what's going to happen when he comes back from a kitchen. Are they going to be together again? Mo and guilty. And he said, oh yeah. He said the two of them aren't rock solid. That's what he told me. So when Mo gets back from his 10 day vacation, the two of them will be reunited like peaches and squirm. Poor president, baby. He tried this really to do that, you know, kind of changed the topic. Wag the old cats ass. But it didn't work too well from the beginning game marriages been an issue that President Bush has got to finesse. He's got the finesse of a bull on a Chinese shop. Underrelection year pressure from a social conservative base, Mr. Bush endorsed the effort to adopt a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage in last few days. He's turned up the volume on the issue. Talking about it in his weekly radio address in Saturday and calling wavering senators over the last year or two, an effort to show up to support for a measure as it headed toward a crucial procedure of hoist today. But after endorsing the measure in February, it would often go weeks without mentioning in public. Suggesting either a personal or political reluctance or both about pushing it too hard. You're pushing too hard. That's what the seed said. And when he did raise the topic, he was careful to modulate his message to avoid alienating the moderate voters warning in particular against the law and the issue to become an excuse for gay bashing. Right, we sure wouldn't want to do that. What do we? Oh no. What they do in the privacy of their house consenting it else should be able to do. That's exactly the way he said it. Mr. Bush said during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Friday, what they do in the privacy of their houses consenting it else should be able to do. Uh huh. Sinking to distinguish between private behavior and giving legal sanction the same sex marriages. This is America. It's a free society, but doesn't mean we have to redefine traditional marriage. Well, let me just go on. By hedging his position, if only a bit, Mr. Bush may have insulated himself somewhat from the sting of the defeat on the proposed amendment suffered in the Senate yesterday. It took a whopping. But the way in which the proposal went down with a whimper short of a simple majority much less than two thirds of the Senate need to for approval raise questions about whether the White House had fundamentally Mr. Nation's attitude on the issue. You see all of the polls that we just look at the polls. Yeah, 65% of America is not in favor of gay marriages including the majority in Edwards, but more than that, in fact, the Lou Dobbs pull a couple lights ago on CNN and hit 80 billion votes, 71% are against the constitutional amendment because they see through it. And if they're so concerned that opening the door to all these other kinds of marriages, that means it's going to be like a two well-ven and six of pigmies. Well, if you show that concern about how about just redefining it as two consenting adults without talking about gender. Isn't that difficult? Wasn't that tough? That was way hard. Okay. What about the newters? Okay, there are adults. Yeah. Well, what difference does it make? Are you picking on gripper again? Is that your problem? Yeah, I got it. A lot of torque. I think I had a nightmare about that child. Something about him. I did. He's just, he is grippy and creepy. And the only reason he's there is because him and Clarence are really, really tied. Jam up in Jelly Tite. 24, 11 at 560 QAN. Rai and local. Here's the course video 560 QA. Long solid. Come on, I'm so excited. I have a contract. Time for the news now, can't I? Rho, want to keep wearing the anchor seats. Oh, Sally is even. She wants her pain and not deserve my breast. Kids are all the news, tough to be missing. Sally is even. And we want those Sally's running fish. Trying to put in with any fish. So come on, because I'm entertaining. We're more tame than we can. Oh, that's a toy. Sally is even. Every one does everything that she says. Rax her with the out-couched, wrinkly Sanchez. Oh, oh, oh, oh! So can't stand the circus. They keep if everything she wants me so she can't untie it out of here. Sally gives me a bit. Sally gives me a bit. All Sally gives you a bit. That's a movie. 1045 with 560 WQA, why haven't played that in a long time? 100 years. Yeah, and long overdue. Sally's bitch gets get her on here right away. Sally? Oh, man, back at you. And a need to Brian somebody suggest. I'll decide out of mind. You'll orange juice queen. We ain't seen in a very long time. We're pretty pleased about that. Missile will bitch. Another one of them Bible thumped in bags. It looked what happened to her man. She appears at some casino in a brand. What is that place? Brandford Brandford Brand whatever it is. And Missouri and Missile somewhere. Why is it? Brand muffin Missouri. Brand muffin Missile. And that's where she's hanging out on. Because nobody else wants nothing to do with that bitch. Even old Bob Green up there in Orlando, the district. You're not the one used to work for with a beer that used to try to take to the swing clubs and get laid. I didn't try to take him there. You did take him there. You're trying to get him laid. No. You got him laid. My business. No. Anyway, which of these people do you think is the most despised offload of personality. Radio TV, newspaper, street corners anywhere of all time did a reliable. Rick Sanchez. He, you're right. He may have an insurmountable lead. He got off the such a big, like secretary in the Belmont. He's just up by open lanks and just storming away from the crowd. Rick Sanchez, one twenty one is kind of a parting shot to South Florida. More Howard David though is instant to second place. He's coming on strong. With 11. I mean, how do compare 11 to 128 now? Eight-way in high Zingha has moved into a second place tie with Mona, 11 of piece. Skookies to rate 10. She's on both their asses. Castor Nova's got seven-letter King's got six. He just went on her. He's already moving up. Gloria Stepon six. She makes my skin crawl. Glenn, our bird hill. Five. Little alienito's got four. Greg B. N. S. Duck on three. Nobody knows who you are Greg. Probably just as well. Anita Bransk got a pair Alan Courtney two. Marilyn Mitzels go one. And none yet four. Tony Sigaretto, little Brian Nork rise. Or Sally Fitz at a 196 vote. Oh, and speaking of people being dragged out of the closet. The phone kept ringing in one capital hill office hourly daily all leading up to yesterday's Senate vote on the constitutional amendment to BAM game marriage. Mike Rogers was on the line again. Oh, good. No, Mike. He knew something very personal about the press secretary of a Republican house member who reports the amendment and he wanted to tell someone perfectly somebody high-ranking that the man is gay. Rogers cannot understand this. How can somebody help articulate the opposition to homosexual unions when he himself is homosexual. In other words, how can somebody be a self-hating fag, Matt? I'm sorry. I don't notice Mark Foley's name in here anywhere. Or for your own Florida representative Mark Foley. I don't see his name in the circle. I know it's a very long article. It's on our website. I'm assuming I can read it. I don't see Charlie Jesus Christ on here either. They floored attorney general. Have you ever seen Charlie Christ and Charlie Nelson arrive together? Same person. Anyway, Rogers, a 40 year old Washington fundraising consultant's wage day controversial outing campaign in the month leading up the yesterday's vote. He set out more than 10,000 emails encouraging and pep-curre perpetrating outings. He handed out flyers at the gay pride parade in June asking people to send it names of gay Hill staffers working for senators and representatives who supported the federal Mergers member. He created a weblog last week listing some of these names. He might want to hop on his log. He made phone calls day and night to the offices and homes of these staffers as message. How dare you? How dare you when it goes on a great line? When it doubts, Sagamow, picking on Screamer. Yeah. Sagamow, picking and picking in this screaming. Oh, listen to this. You haven't thought that the Harold was bad? Yeah, I think the Harold bad. The suicide note pins blame on Florida newspaper. I think both of the papers in Florida left them in anybody below their brains. But this is not the Harold. A former school board member, charged with having had sex with a 12 year old boy was found dead yesterday near Naples, Florida, and an apparent suicide. He left behind a note attacking the local newspaper for publishing several detailed news stories about the case. The dead man Nelson, Farber Jr. 52, said it was disturbing when an irresponsible press causes the families of the accused to suffer so much hurt in the humiliation. All the name is sawing newspapers and ads. Police hand withheld the content of that note and several others. But the man's attorney sent a copy of one of the notes to the local paper that Naples daily News last night. I'm sure you read that daily. Oh yeah. Naples daily knows that's a biggie. The newspaper ran a lengthy story about to death of the man who apparently shot himself in a haze. They ran this story this morning. The papers editor Phil Lewis told E&P, what's E&P? O editor and publisher. We wouldn't do anything differently defending their straight news coverage to their criminal case. A passerby found a body of Farber on the ground near a swing-set in Ridgewood Park. Farber was former Coddy County school board member, in the note released by his attorney he wrote. It is sad that in our society and especially our fairly educated community, simply the accusation of sexual misconduct is enough to destroy an individual. Farber a lawyer and posted a $100,000 bond and left the county jail on June 10. It'd been charged with five kinds of unlawful sexual activity with a child. Farber had vowed to fight the charges saying he feared how much the case would hurt his own children. Other family members. Court records said Farber had met the youth in question to a son's little league baseball team and had brought him many gifts. They also described as many as four of the potential Farber victims. I wonder if he's related to B Farber. Please, the greatest woman harness driver of all time. And Charlie Farber, her former husband. Remember Z lady? Nope. How about Mr. Z? It's Mr. Z. Mr. Z. You never met that crowd. I'll be quick, did you? No. Oh boy, now that you think you've met some real real characters. Okay, the man, the guy would have found a bag in the gullible eyes. And all the other critics, the Steve, would have had the gullible hands. But that's Jack with the hands. Would the funny guy hand right? Jack? Yeah. Then there's this one. Yeah. Well, that goes without saying. But until you've met Mr. Z, Mr. Z, who just, once every two, three years, I'll see him at the top of the park. Just go away, Mr. Z. I can't stand you. Okay, you're up there. Everything that the world hates about New York City. Mr. Z. Oh, brother. I'm getting spilt. He's just thinking about him. Speaking of spilt. He's either who else gives me spilties when I see her. I give up. But I won't be seeing her on no spots for a slim fast no more. Oh, woopy. Yeah, woopy. Woopy, do. And of course, our good friend Lynn Samuels has gone on a hysterical. She fired off a hysterical psychotic note last night to slim pass. She put their address their email under her website. She's just foaming it them out because they have taken woopy off the edge. First of all, slim fast sucks anyway. So what's the problem? Right. If you're pissed off at slim pass, don't buy that crap. It's not going to help you lose anyway. And now they come out with their new low car because there are other stuff like I've put it here. It's loaded with sugar and carbohydrates, and it tastes like crap anyway. comedian woopy Goldberg will no longer appear ads for diet aid makers. Slim fast following her loot rip off on President Bush on his name at a fundraiser last week. The company said yesterday. Florida based on facet was disappointed in Goldberg's remarks. Hey, hang. It was a plan. Slim fast general manager Terry Olson said in a statement adding that the company we Grats that Goldberg's marks offended some customers. Two quick and bad, okay? It's America. She spoke her mind. She said that Bush is a piece of crap. And a few other things that we got you on the year. I don't dislike her as much anymore. Republicans have expressed, I still can't look at her, but I'm dislike her as much. Republicans have expressed outrage over the fundraiser for presumptive democratic nominee John Kerry and his vice president so running major on it was which entertainers line up to skewer the president. The New York Post said of Goldberg's appearance at the event, waving a bottle of wine she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual word plays on Bush's name and a riff about female genetea. A spokesman for Goldberg to try to meet you comment. Stupid. Slim fast as a unit of Anglo Dutch food to the Tergin group, Unilever pick. Oh Unilever. Oh Unilever. What is that PLC? I don't know what that is. Please. Just say Unilever. Okay. Unilever. Well, it's a Dutch thing. Well, can't be all bad. Then I want to face some drugs in here too, probably. Maybe it's free.

I don't care anything about either one of them including him now. They just I'm just every time you flip your channel MTV. E. Oh, you and they're everywhere. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? Not already with them. Who cares what they have children. I mean if we could watch them in the process of making a baby that would be very exciting. I would certainly tune in that and sit close to the TV. Yeah. What other net? Who cares about this contrived craft and whether they got the right groceries and all of this other all brother. Man, you talk about milking something for all its worth. Okay. I know there's a line that comes in there and in fact I got one back for you too but no chance. You see the one to stop. Look at this. I never thought I'd say this but I missed the fart drops. Facts is Mike. You think that if the Democrats get in the FCC will back off or are they going to gone forever? I got news for it. That might be a great campaign slogan for carrying it with a vote us in and the Farts come back. And I'd be great. That doesn't ride. Well, we'll come up with something. Sure. Give us the leading parts and we'll bring back the exciting Farts. We'll come up with some more exciting maneuver. But nevertheless, that's a good start. To get back our fart. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16. See how to really care. Like I said, just give me the money and we're doing this fine without the Farts without the **** it. It's a little annoying when you have to dump something as an Octopus as I hate the bird that bit. I mean, that bit is from 100 years ago. That goes to show you how far back in time this current bunch of lunatics are taking us. And by the, I hate to break the news. Demisdius firm who was always so right wing and for every Republican that ever came down a pike and defending the Iraqi attack and everything else. But as soon as this other crap started coming down from the FCC, what does he do? He makes a marker out of himself and all. They're out to get me while I hate to break the news. The like I said, but the most, the most rabid member of the FCC is Michael Cops. He makes a, a colon sonner, Michael Powell looked like a Sunday school preacher. That's how he makes him look like a great liberal. Michael Cops, who just happens to be a Democrat and Jonathan Edelstein. He's no picked together. He wants 80 billion dollar fines if he could get him. So there you go. Oh no, it's all about the, I'm so tired of that. Howard's certain stuff, man.

Where each contest has to drink himself to oblivion. And where he gets the highest blood out the whole level first goes on to level 92. The run down at the gesturing and the whole has home section of the game. This leads 4-game police to battle. And each player must come up with a different squeeze to go home and give his life to him. Then it's off to the final leg of the board game. Higher in a journey. Go to court and whoever gets off with the easiest sentence win. It's our new fought for the whole of the game. The I can drive like Rick Sanchez or game. The whole industry. Well, my team, thank you, Paul. There you go. I was pretty good. That one in Bill and Ted Zessel and Adventure was they brought in breathlessly. And then hello. Cut all Neil Rogers. He's playing my bad shit. Right. I tell you he is really a same case. You know, the original sad sack has in sack of crap. The aslady is sack of junk. Shack of the crap. Right. It's the old sugar. I got an idea. Sugar shack. Everybody's not all these diets. How about the sugar shack diet? Where do you put the sugar in your head? And it swells up to like four times normal size. And you and can hang out with shack. Shack it is so. Shack. Ha ha ha ha. Perfect. It is so sad. But then again, what you got a bunch of people that are bored, metless. What do you expect? As many as 249 Floridians convicted of cramps. Now the state could be mistakenly barred from voting in November. Despite a two year old agreement by Florida. Elections officials that was meant to return them to the roles. How do you like that? Take me back to my roles, Valet Man. Oh, I forgot that's right. The jostre like rules, Royce. As you want to Lamborghini. Let's take it for our. I was thinking I'm going to do that. Pull next to you. They don't be stealing from me now. He'll settle. A pull I we've never done before. Have we? What's your favorite year and model car? Voltaim even if you never owned or drove one. I think we've ever done that before. Not a good one. I call and sick on that day. Why is that? They'll be calling up everything. Well, let's you don't like that pull. I think it's a great manly masculine pull. Sure. It's manly masculine. It'll be a terminal. I think. Why? Oh, I was about 55. T.B. How about the third day? No 57. I got 55. What? 55. Yeah. I thought the 57 was a little funky one. A really tiny little collectors and all three. 55. 56 and seven are well, you see they can argue about that. There's nothing wrong with that. You're not you're a good one to talk about. Pulls Mr. Foos ball. Hey, that was a hot pull. I know that's very. I'm still having recovered from that. Anyway, the reason lost paperwork and still moving to the state. I'm not sure if you can see these people. I could smear it off the rules as in smear the holders. I'll call it an important number. Convicted in the state. It's an automatically restore. Footing rights to felons who have completed their sentences. Administrators of the floor. Election division say they've worked hard to repair. Mistakes from a 2000 election. Right. And they've already reinstated more than 1700. That'll stay felons. But there's always a big, bad butt. Right. In the way. But efforts to restore the rest. It's time to be by the state. Slaughter. Respond to request. We've worked very hard to get this done. Said Don Roberts directed the division of elections. And we've been writing and calling everyone to the state. It's a done easy task. And we've acted in good faith. A long but civil rights lawyers are extracted. The agreement from the state is part of a legal settlement. Two years ago. The election officials are plotting unnecessarily. And the name should be restored. Pronto post-taste. And look at that. Taking the truth to power.

The National Association for the Advancement of Dark Folks. The first one. And the reason Warren Harding didn't show up is because. I'll give you a two word clue. Okay. That was the reason he didn't show up. How many he's he-harding. Schedule to peer, but he had the nerve to croak before he got there. So then we have old Calvin Coolidge sticking his nose into it. So I'll present it and he doesn't even show up there. We'll slap in the face of ever there was one because. He knows they're not going to vote for many ways so for Armstrong Williams.

It's a series about Matt, George being a gay who supports people Republicans who bash Gays. It's a syndrome that affects many Republicans, including elected gay Republican Congressman and senators who support Bush's anti gay rhetoric and agenda. There are also people behind the Bush campaign apparatus. We have to be high to be an E.C., administration and the right wing thinks thanks in conservative values organizations who are gay. One might wonder, oh, you know who I can't stand. He's not gay, but who makes me, oh, the worst he's worse than an anchor. He's worse than any of them. Is that Michael Medved? That right wing lunatic posing as a movie critic? Yeah, I'm making him try to get him out. Especially MSNBC. He must get paid for by word or something. They keep trying him out over and over and just slap against an effect. Even Paul Zahn had him on the other night. Michael Medved. In fact, now that I think of it, he looks a little bit swissy too. Looks like Miss Hawkeheimer. Anyways, is one might wonder what makes them tick, meaning these are closet queens, right wing self-hating. Could you be gay and supporting anti-gay president or political party? Oh, could you be African American and said, my dear, the KKK? Oh, could you be Jewish and support neo-Nazis? Boy, like Paul Wolfowitz? We don't pretend to know what's goes on in Dredges' mind. Maybe he's just the ultimate post-gay liberation gay, a gay and a public denial, otherwise the right to be a complete slime ball, just like Carl Roe. What we can say, slime ball? Because we didn't ask about it. No, we better call what's your name that bitch over in April and find out if we can say slime ball choice?

A sexual orientation becomes an issue when it makes them a hypocrite. And Republican hypocrisy is our number one interest at buzz flash. Because it's the defining characteristic of many people in Republican leadership and media-shill positions. Indeed around the time that the White House committed national treason by outing a CIA operative salary claim, who is specialized in tracking weapons of mass destruction. In order to send a message to Joe Wilson and the intelligence community that the Bush Cartel was going to enforce its own merit-out code at all cost even if it meant betraying America. There was another curiously conspire that bubble the surface of the mainstream press courtesy of Miss Drogge. Here's the background from age of 19th, 2003 Toronto Star-Saurah, a star story. Last week ABC's Jeffrey Coppán formerly of CBC's The National Tucket Direct Hit from the White House It seems via the Scourless Dredging Port. That's because Coppán, a Toronto native now based in Miami, gave voice to American troops stationed in Iraq who spoke out against the war rather than the peace while calling for US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's resignation. A ostensibly incensed over Kaufman's world to the news tonight report Tuesday, which was repeated on Wednesday's Good Morning America, the White House had a dirty trickster, tip gossip manga mad drogge, to how the reporter was up against the wall, openly gay and no blind fall, no last cigarette Canadian. And so on Wednesday for eight minutes, drogge's headline screened ABC News reporter who filed troop complaints, a troop complaint story openly gay Canadian, before being edited to read ABC News reporter who filed troops complaints stories Canadian. So what the apparent behest of the White House, drogge leaks a slime ball headline, that a Canadian reporter who dared to air that some American soldiers were disgruntled with Rumsfeld's gay. Yes, that's right. The only news and judges headline was that the reporter was gay, which is meant to discredit him. What if he had said ABC News reporter who filed troops complaints story, Jew? There's no point to the headline except to in essence stir up the right wing white males, by implying that the reporter was disloyal on trustworthy because he's gay, how much more despicable can you get? But it's the one house GOP, drogge scapegoating, gutter crawling nexus had work here. It happened so often it's become acceptable for the mainstream press to consider discriminatory accusations as news. It starts with the GOP right wing conspiracy character assassination squad during impeachment wars canstere as team leak like a fossil full of holes shows up on drudge and ends up on the television news. For the record, drogge denies that he's gay as a communist who covers gays from time to time notes, cyber gossip Matt drogge says that he's not gay, but one thing is clear, no matter his sexual orientation, he's an nasty faggot. And here's part 2 Mad drogge are you gay? As detailed in bushflash.com report last week, drogge played the gay card with him and ignore publishers from putting the insane clown posse of book allegedly focusing on the hypocrisy of the kids star team and other right wing junkyard dogs, drogge was successful in bullying and intimidating team of brown at talk mirror max to publisher to question a sin book before even hit the galleys. During his weeklong barrage of attacks on the insane clown posse, drogge lam-based at talk mirror max for during the disclosed personal picadillos. In his June 7 dispatched drogge wrote, it can now be revealed that the book, the insane clown posse, not only digs deep into the private sex lives and business dealings of major minor Clinton critics, but Connelly the author's working manuscript also features derogatory sexlers against impeachment players, details too hot even for the web. Mad would have a stinking was outraged by an author dubbing into someone's private life he couldn't disclose the details of the book out of concern for maintaining a sense of propriety on the internet. Of course on June 12 drogge must have forgotten his prudish lives because the drogge poured headline at morning red, ester host book features talking Bill Clinton penis. That's right with a horribly unflattering photograph of the president just above the headline, looking as if he were sucking on a lemon, and drogge is excessively poured on June 12 drogge poured on the details. Esteross has created a character around president Clinton's penis according to reports, a penis which will talk at expressive opinions in the book. And a gratuitous catty statement, ester host will appear live at NBC's today to launch the book on July 18, host made a kitty-curric and mat-law request the author, like he didn't explore flowers claim that the president liked to pleasure himself with her sexual aid. Drogge rebels in any gutter rumor about Clinton that he can angus fedora Hada, but he transformed into a prud when it comes to his friends on the right wing. He charges the author of the insane clown possey with slaying derogatory sexlers against impeachment players, evaluating the private sex lives, but Drogge only curves out his own or privacy when his right wing pals are put out of the microscope. Drogge is like a kid at the edge of a lake on a hot summer day, and that just can't wait to jump in except in this case he's relishy, he relishes diving into a scum pond again and again and again. But only if the Clinton or Democrats are involved otherwise he's in a dignity school who won't allow others to even approach the murky slime. So at this weekend bus flash asked you if you were gay or straight because of the harm that you're doing to the gay community by supporting the right wing agenda. Today we asked, are you the outrage prud who was aghast as you read the lured tails in the draft of a book about the sexual shenanigans of the Kenny Star crowd? Or are you the reporter who writes blurring headlines and giddy accounts about the president's sexual organs? Are you the prud of the warrior tell us which? Come out, come out before it's too late, Miss Fudge, okay before you burn in hell. God, what a piece of turd. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon so that they give away all his David bus's power cards or what? Don't know, didn't hear? Well, I don't know how long the kill was going to be there, I guess till they're all gone, so maybe we still got some left. At the Shell Station north was 87th out of 14th street and the rail stop headed pickup your free $10.00 David bus's power card while they last. Evidently must still have some of the ways he to call and said, I'm going home, something like that. Or maybe. I'm going to best fill in for George that I possibly can. I appreciate that one call, it was good. But, which of these people do you think? Was or is the most despised outflow to personality? Whether it's radio, TV, politics, newspapers, whatever, paperboy. A paperboy, I wonder how cratch Stephen's is doing. How she lately, don't want. Brian Andrews. Rick Sanchez, 230, Wayne Hising of 55, Low Howard David at only 39, oh man, you talk about the mighty of falling. But, the Dirty Boy, wow, Mo. Old Jason since 23 slowly, steadily, but surely. See, I think if you wouldn't have had that other police today, they would have pulled out all, they'd have pulled both girls out. But, I wonder if it's like, you know, he's old news, they got it out of their system. Spookies in the rain 19, Larry King 18, Paul Castanova 18, doing very nicely. For an old turd, Anita Brian 16, Gloria Stephon 15, Elian Ethel Gonzalez, Nate, and the Elijah Zate, Amy and I, I had to get everything together. Same person. Call the cops if I do. There you go. Please. Cracker, please. Greg, we'd have five. Glenn, the board, Hill, five. Brian, Rokross, four. Alex Penellus, four. Pinkus Penellus. The crow has got three. Old Warren Crow, Marty. Channer Reno, she's got three. Dr. James Kennedy, three. Alan Courtney's got a pair of Tony C. Wetter, two. Joy Reynolds, two. Marilyn Mitchell, one. Bill, come on. One and none yet. For Josh Beckett or Sally Fits out of for Radiate. That's interesting, Sally Fits. I think they like Sally. Huh? Yeah. They're like her instruments, too. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. You know, a lot of people used to think that we made those stories up. Yeah. They're all true. WQAM, hello. Neal, God. Yes, sir. Speaking. How are you, sir? All right, I think. I have an idea for a full. Okay. Did you watch St. Lain last night? No. Well, they did a big thing on all the Mexicans that are in flux in the United States. Right. And their idea was to go after, well, Americans had the idea, and we had to go after the people that are giving them jobs. Okay. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I know. And I was thinking we should have a poll on, you know, what should we do about going after the people that are giving them jobs. You know, make them higher, legal, American, and several. It's double the American. Uh-huh. Something like that. Right. When I love you forever, you can't follow by. Of the listed in the view, since I was 19 years old, I think you were fun. And now I'm going to vote this year. I can't get enough news into me. I have to read the favor, watch every new Shinoi can do the best to your saving the world, Neil. Okay. Thanks for the little chat, Paul. Have a great day. Thank you. Oh, I feel like better to go tell off now. Oh, look at this. The former army scientists identified by authorities as a person of interest in the 2001 Anthrax attacks, sued the New York Times Company and columnist Nicholas Christoph yesterday. And that's good. I'm glad you did that. Because Nicholas Christoph, he, he said some crappy things about Michael Moore. Yeah. He's not a good guy. No. I apologize. Profusely. Uh, there's a column I put on there for, uh, by Nicholas Christoph a few days ago. And I guess I didn't read the last part of it. I apologize. Yeah. I'm just, excuse me. Anyway, uh, against the, the Times and the columnist at Christoph, depending on the paper defined him, the series becomes that identified him is the likely culprit. Okay. And then again, they ought to apologize. And of course, we all remember right now. Have they actually caught the guy? I don't know. He actually, you know what? You know me. I'm out of touch because I'm in Toronto. I'm out of the country. I'm out of touch. So maybe they caught that guy. Kim was dealing with the letters with all that anthrax. Anyway, I just was looking for an excuse to play anthrax and stalling for time to find the fact that no autographs. You just call for time to find it. The lawsuit filed by Stephen Hadfield and he was just recording Alexander. He said, Christoph identified him as the anthrax killer to light a fire under investigators in their probe of the anthrax four maillings, which killed five people in 6 and 17. He accused Christoph of hurling false and defamatory allegations at the Times of engaging in substandard and unethical journalism. In a series of columns in 2002, Christoph criticized the FBI, for failing to aggressively pursue a scientist. He had first identified as Mr. Z. Honey, like that. Mr. Z. What were we just talking? He belongs behind bars. He wrote that the bio-defense community had called Mr. Z. A. likely, Cupport was buzzing about Mr. Z. Behead is back in part because the scientist was familiar with anthrax and was angered at the suspension of his top security experience less than a month before the attacks. Christoph, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist later, announced that Mr. Z. was had filled. He also wrote that head-pull deservedly presumption of innocence, and that there was not a shred of traditional physical evidence-looking empty attacks. Christoph didn't return to call to his office. The Times spokesman said the newspaper believed this case does not have merit-yodiotia. The lawsuit was delayed a step by head-pull 50 to defend himself since attorney general John Hermann Gering Jr. Rae Ayashkrab, publicly called him a person of interest in the anthrax probe of 2002. And cost him his job and groomed his life in it all of these other minor things. Just because they had looked like they were doing something. Oh, we got Joseapadilla, we got Stephen Hadfrell, all these people of interest. And then we got that guy in the wheelchair that used to be buddy buddy with Osama. He was pretty dangerous. You see him there today? He looked pretty dangerous to me. Larry Flint? Is there we're hearing him? No, not Larry Flint. When is that Larry Flint book coming out? If that thing doesn't come out, I'm going to be POden Ferdup. 1158 at WQM, you wake up every morning in a crowded bed. Between the kids and the dog and the cats, is there no room left for use?

Well, I guess, speaking of compassionate conservatives. The United States yesterday rejected the UN Secretary General Co. Cup of Coffee and his plea to inject a billion dollars years into global age fund. It's not going to happen. The West Global AIDS Coordinator Randall Tobias told a small group of reporters that the 15 international AIDS conference in Bangkok. The person that's requested $2 million for next year, I think there's... That is more than adequate to meet the requirements of the global fund in terms of getting money out for putting programs in place. He'd be saying. And in cold on Tuesday for the U.S. to contribute at least a billion dollars a year, echoing a plea from Richard Feetham. The executive director of the Global Fund for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which needs more than $3 billion for 2005. Provice at Washington was the leading global fight against AIDS and spend nearly twice as much to fight the pandemic as the rest of the world combined. But controversy about its payments to the private fund global fund, the public private global fund, launched in 2002 as a brainchild of an and as overshadowed discussions at the 8th summit this week. Critics have condemned the U.S. for pursuing a go-to-lone strategy in sitting up its own 15 billion five-year AIDS action plan, rather than folding its efforts in the international body. What was that what we're doing with everything now? We're out to participating in the world of nations. It's us against the world. Isn't that the way it was now? Yeah, I know it. Yeah. Here's a very disgusting story. Life in Bush is America. I don't want it. Well, I do. Yeah, I'm only on twice a week now filling in for George. And so as a result, I better get in my looks while I can. You know what I mean? Did we get a call from the Gueldafine out of those David Vusty's power cards? No. Well, like I said, go on and get him. Probably pretty, I write the fact that he's not getting flooded with people. Of course, if we knew what those were, it would probably help. Well, the people that want him, they know what they are, right? They're for the games. They're for the games that David Vusty's brought him. Little games you play, you know? Games people play. Not copy. Right. Pencil push. By the way, thank you, Tony. Oh, thanks to Tony's. I thought I was, that's why Vusty's sounded to me like somebody had a mouthful. Show no. By the way, what you else said, it's still on. It's still on. Okay. Well, I glad to find that out. Thank you, Miguel. Now, that's, I don't know how many we got. How many thousand we got? I'm good, man. There must be what's taken so long to give money. Or maybe because of the fact that it's the middle of the summer and dog days and There ain't nobody out there. I've had you there. There's something going on. Maybe our Brubby trap. I know that's a big part of it. That's getting tremendous response on our website. But man, we are just kicking big gigantic Harry Smelly ass. You know, considering what time of the year it is? Yeah. Aren't you shocked? My old boy. Oh, that's for you reading. Thanks again to Tony's over there at Northwest. Whatever it is, second after. What is it? What is it? One, ninety-third and four, forty-one. No. Okay. Oh, it's not. Trust me. I thought it was Northwest, second after. And one hundred and ninety-third. That is four, forty-one. No. No, fourth. Yeah. So another, it's Tony's on four, forty-one. You. I never knew that all this time. I thought I never really thought about that very much. I thought, so, four, forty-one was seventh avenue. Down south of the Golden Glaze it is. I see. But then again, we're almost a Brower County. We're almost to the, uh, order. It takes a hook. So go over and see Miguel at the, uh, Sheldon Station, Northwest 87, and 14-speed in Durrell. Oh, that's why nobody's going over there. Who don't want to go over to Durrell? There's no golf going on right now. Unless maybe Moe is playing with it. Stop, I had to pick up a free $10.00 Dave and much as PowerCard right now. And see the lovely Miguel. He's waiting for you. Like he had rid of that crap and go home. And be with his lovely wife. Then she worked on his wife. Normally. Well, that's right. I think I got a baby now. He can't afford. I'm going to kind of salary. He's making a QM. He can't afford no nanny. I guarantee you that. Well, what do you mean normally? Don't need no nanny when you're Cuban. I don't understand. You've got a boy loves. Oh, I bail out the aboylos coming there. Check out the kids' penis. Anyway, a husband and wife who wore anti-bush t-shirts to the president's fourth July appearance aren't going down without a fight. They'll be represented by lawyers from the East here. You as they contest the trespassing charges against them. Today, in Charleston, municipal court Charleston, South Carolina. Police took the colon Jeff Wank away in handcuffs from the event which was built as a presidential appearance not a campaign rally that were wearing t-shirts that red love America hate bush. Spectators who wore probose t-shirts and bush-cheney campaign buttons were allowed to stay of course. We weren't doing anything wrong, said Jeff Wank. The couple said they had tickets just like everybody else. So they simply stood around a capital stop so we're steps with the rest of the spectators. We sang the National Anthem, Wank said. The ranks hardly fit the image of Raval Rousers Jeff Wank 29 has a master's degree in oceanography. Nicole Rank 30. Got good man! The degrees in biological science and marine biology that been married for seven years. Nicole Rank arrived in Charleston soon after the memorial day floods. She was working as deputy environmental liaison officer for the FEMA. Making sure cities and counties debate federal environmental laws as they were prepared roads and bridges. After police arrested the ranks, they finger-predited them and took their mug shots. The FEMA told Nicole Rank she was no longer needed in West Virginia. I've not been fired per se, she said, but I was released from this job and when they released you from a job, you no longer get paid. Which is a cute way of saying, you're fired! Of course I can't say that because Donald Trump copyrighted that expression. The rank started to go home to Corpus Christi Texas, but the only guard as far as road Oak Virginia, what had occurred to them, they might not be able to contest their arrest if they weren't in Charleston on their court date. A phone call confirmed their suspicions so they turned it around. We were living in motels ever since said Jeff Rank was spent two days in his motel room with his wife. Their cochers Spangled Feynman and their Marlaleigh can't rower. Our road WR, how do you say that? Rower? Rower? It's extremely difficult financially. We can't afford doing this for very long, but they both had a state and fight the charges because we don't think we're guilty. Since Bush took office early in 2001, people have been banned from displaying anti-bush messages that doesn't have Bush appearances across the country. I mean, I'm going to tell you something boys and girls anybody that supports this kind of fascism. You are a fascist, you are a neo-Nazi bastard, you okay? That's a bunch of self-destructive fool. Right. Just like Miss Fudge and at self-hating Faggotary, you're hers. In September the ACAU filed a federal lawsuit against the Secret Service, Sickening and Junction against the Bush administration for celebrating protestors at his public appearances. The Secret Service agreed that such censorship was wrong, said, would tool Walsak one of the lawyers that filed the lawsuit, sounds like a Polak. They had an internal memo dated September 2002, and they couldn't treat protesters differently or worse than anyone else at a presidential appearance Walsak said. The judge said, any agent responsible for doing so could be held liable for damages. Remember Walter Slaysak? No. Number Fanny? How about short fat Fanny with Larry Williams? Oh, the echo records. I'm just all this is for Booker Brian to abuse him. We have our own little show going. The Secret Service at the time local police is sequester anyone displaying an anti-administration message. Usually in areas completely out of sight in your shot of Bush because the Secret Service agreed with the ACAU that it shouldn't be doing that, the judge just missed the case. Prior to our filing our students September we get a couple of confirmed protest zone complaints every month, Walsak said, After we filed a were practically none. We had two documented incidents between September and March one little rock Arkansas and one in Knoxville, Tennessee. But now Laira's like Walsak are carefully monitoring cases like their ranks and two similar incidents recently in Pennsylvania. We're trying to assess what's going on in these appearances, whether these protests zones are resuming he said. We are continuing to monitor all campaign events by both Republican Democratic candidates who are prepared to go back into court to see if discrimination is occurring. It's an or why do you in way to keep speech out of sight of those the speeches intended critique. We want to nip this in the bud before it becomes a habit of future administrations. A Bush spokesman of course did return telephone calls in come out of the necessity of a free speech zone. Free speech calls on my fat ass. By the way seven and a half pounds and we can have a blast. Since we had the old mommy in the box. Is that sound what? No nothing. Is that sound insensitive? No. No, but at least I admit it. I never realized it. I never knew it. And now she lived in 91 and she had a fine life and you know it was well taken care of mostly by me. And now she's you know pushing up daisies. But at the meantime I finally discovered and miraculously amazingly that I had this kind of 40 in thing. This kind of smothering, nettering, nagging, whatever, how do you want to describe it? That prevented me from getting rid of that compulsion that sugar urge that horrendous desire to nash. I've ever heard of Zara tonight and what will last can you have a nice food? I'm ready to go back for second. How about you are? I know what Josh is probably eating pizza with the... See you. Yeah, but he's not. Oh, I see. He's a subman. Oh, a subman. He's a subman in a company and he hopes you are too. And a good... That's very carried away by the way. Here he's... Rock solid.

Of course he's rock solid. It a kid 10. I think that Dave and Boring owes me a lot of money. You want to know why? Why? Now I realize that these clips are, you know, they're just a little cryptic and not a games, but he started sounding like animated almost excited. We're helping him. Huh? That's right. I'm going to try to rip him in his hands. He even on the clips. He sounded so comatose and it's up up in a way. A home run for the Marlins. Mike, low, you know. Now he sounds like somebody who had a fire under his ass. I think the person who had a fire under his ass was... Oh god! You're truly. How do you like that? So you like him now? No. No. He's got a fine voice. He knows the game. He's been around a long time. I'm not, I never met the man. It's not that I dislike him. It's not a personalist business. I have any problem with a guy. But the fact that a matter is that he was very boring. And even you've agreed with that numerous times, that was really brilliant. I was really crazy about that. He was somebody who would wake that bastard up. Now what he said during something like that. Let's see. Oh, look at that. Curtis in for the dog. I knew it was too good to be true. I mean, the idea that mad dogs are going to work a whole week. I just gone mad dog, you demand. Oh, right. Haha. Oh. If we got a scam going here or what? That's the worst. I just gone there and I'm all with your 10-day vacation. We know what it's all about. Let's work more money. Just keep the checks coming. Anyway, I'm doing the best I can. I can't fill in for George. We'll be back on again tomorrow. Of course. And I'll be back next Tuesday. And then briefly on Thursday because we got the next two, Thursdays. Marlon game. Oh, yeah. Love those Marlins. And Dave Ann Boring. So bad news for you. A proposed ballot measure to double the state's $25,000 home set exemption can't go before voters this November. They Florida Supreme Court ruled us to short time ago. But they proposed to create a six point $6.15 minimum wage can go to the ballot. High court be ruling. The Supreme Court review citizen initiative to judge if they're clearly explained and deal with just one subject. Those are the only two issues. Oh, this is I guess it must be chopped off on their website. The only two issues the high court addresses. The property tax memo was a bank ruled by a viral beach millionaire who promoted his property tax relief for homeowners. But critics argue it was really a tax shift on the commercial and industrial property. And local government officials and governor Jan Bursa, they worried about the two-baked other price tag on the proposal. The minimum wage proposal or create a statement of mortgage that started $6.15, which would double Josh's pay. But increases and really to keep up with inflation. It doesn't yet have to happen in signatures needed to make the ballot. But they're working on it. Just like I'm sure they're still working on it. Think they get the slots into the grace tracks. Oh, man, do we net that bad? What? If you could see how the people here are packed in it would buy and raise track. Even on the days when there's no reason going on at the time. You wouldn't believe it. You'd be flabbergooced and okay. Oh, you ought to see the engines. Right. Packed. Packed. And the engines are making all the money while the rest of the state is always on a verge of bankrupt. People are looking for it. That's right. They want to go have a good 10-year-old. They're all going to go bankrupt. They're going to go gamble with. Listen, if they want a gamble, there's no state in the country that's got more gambling and flora d'uh. Even in New York State, I don't think they got no high-layer dog racing. Do they? No. No. Florida, we got it all. We got your third bread racing. We got hardness racing. We got dog racing. We got a high-live. We got the lottery. We got the cock fights in the sweet water and little Havana. And Hylia. What more do you need? Because Cino is baby to make Zillions and Zillions of dollars for real money for education. And things that we need money for instead of always crying for them out. We don't have this. We don't have that. That's not your crap by the way about only Fags play the slot machines. I hate to break the news, dear. But there was a very fine young man in the early 20s. Not bad, look at either of Indian descent. Get us play in a machine next to me the other day. Besides, I said Fags in old ladies. Yeah, well, he wasn't an old lady and wasn't a Fag. How do you know? Trust me what I tell you. I can just nif on. He may have sniffed a little on that that curry side, you know. He's not a little like you, curry. He was a nice guy. And he won 2600 bucks at about 10 minutes. Gay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Excellent. And anyway, I just mentioned that in passing because you see one thing about you being such a hard ass. You live in this narrow little world. You can't afford to be going to Vegas very often. Unfortunately, which I know you'd probably like to go. Especially that way from your wife. But I mean, if you could see that we all wore the little bit more. You'd understand you live in a cloistered environment there. I know. Never the less. Never less you full of crap. Gay my ass. I'm sorry, though. What a giveaway. Okay. Here's the poll so far. Rick Sanchez. We keep trying to drum up some competition for this guy. We just can't do it.

There's so many fantastic things. Has got a thing on their website. Which I just got my email. Which I don't want to read the whole thing, but it's just a part of it is right in our neck of the woods. My good personal close friend Jim Stork. Uh, it's a dear move on, member. Yesterday, President Bush has effort to write divisiveness and hate in the constitution went down in flames. Oh, hey, man. Republicans need it. 67 votes in the Senate to pass the federal management. Are they talking about Charlie Christie again? Oh, hey, man. That's right. But they only got 48 votes on yesterday. Not even a civil majority. It's a huge victory for people living in breathing. Despite the defeating Congress, Republicans threaten not to make this an election year issue. Our response. Bring it on. Today, we're highlighting four great democratic candidates who are running against some of the staunch of supporters of writing discrimination in the constitution. If we chip in a little of their campaigns, we can demonstrate that when you try to deny people who civil rights, you don't just lose a vote in Congress, you lose your seat. Nobody wants to lose their seat. Back to him. You can make a secure easy online contribution to these campaigns right now. And then it's got a link to move on packed.org. Yaddi Addi. It says, while all four of our new future candidates have posed the merge amendment, they're also each good progressives and other issues as well. Each of these candidates also has a chance to knock off a conservative right wing politician, moving us closer to the control of the US House. Now, the only one I want. I'm not going to waste the time with Oklahoma and in the end. And what's the, or whatever the other one is, but our first candidate is Jim Stork, an openly gay man, locked in one of the most competitive races in the country. Jim is running against conservative Republican, the anxious clay Shaw and Florida's 22nd district, a democratic leaning seat that grew one in 2000 by five percent. And John Kerry is currently leading in double digits. Stork the former mayor of America now says here, willton gardens, will you people get a right of will bond.org? I tell you people don't know you asked for my elbow. Willton manners now, willton gardens. Jesus God, what in flowers? Willton, let us Milton. The former mayor of willton, man, is what it should say. And a highly successful small business owner is running in the, a health assault ball player too. And a close personal friend of mine once upon a time. But anyway, is running into aggressive and intelligent campaign in the city of the city, and the mayor of presidential battleground politics for our county Florida. His election to Congress would make him only the fourth openly gay member serving the West House. Gloria, a movie member from Miami says of Jim Jim Stork, as a man who's well respected and presented restoring the rights for all of us rights there being removed by the Patriotic and rights that are being denied to people to the sexual orientation of the man of honor. And that is much needed in the West Congress. You go Jimmy, nice going boy. So there you go. Sit him for the money, please. Was that enthusiastic enough? No, no. No, no. All right. Let's take some calls here. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon, where it was lunch. Let's get it out of our system. A little bit of that good old soft Florida. A little ad hate. Look at disgusted nausea that nausea is feeling. Don't forget everybody hates somebody sometime. Am I right? All right. Right. Especially in South Florida. Everybody hates somebody all the time. All the hate all the time. Which of these people do you think is or was the most despise, South Florida personality of all time? Radio TV, newspaper, politics, law order, misorder, street corners, anything. Here's what we got live. You know what we got. Rick Sanchez, kill him so far. Like that guy. WQAM. Hello.

Got fine for that. Cause it was too funny. So let's get Steve Kane on there. Mr. Ego. Mr. Ego Jr. Excuse me. And the stand major. Reason I say Mr. Ego Jr. is nobody has an ego like Howard Stern. I don't know. I know we have a lot of Stern fans listening to this show. Fine. I don't know. You're entitled. You're a crap. You know, supporting all those white wingers all at that time. Kiss and bushes ask for a long, long time. Kissing up to the war and all of the Southern Unacceptable garbage. Now all of a sudden capitalizing and exploiting the freedom of speech issue to make himself into a murder and to like give more people a publicity. Then that's all he's all about. I mean, I handed to him. He knows how to do it. And he's always threatening to walk out and threatening if Mel Carma's and leaves a whole bunch of us here at infinity or walk. He ain't going anywhere. Okay. All they had to do was lick his wounds and to put him on a few more of their stations all the way. And that's it. That's all it took to keep that ego going. I mean, who else in this business stays out on extra half hour every day, pass when their time is up just because they're ego. In other words, they haven't finished feeding their own ego yet. See what I'm saying? Yeah. I can't take it no more. WDQAM. Hello. Daniel. Yes sir. How about the mayor of the toilet bowl, Dave County? Hi, Alia. Role Martinez. But I want Martinez.

This isn't very long or pondress support is a president push and sister Despite the problems be setting his administration at least he's brought morality back to the White House Contrasting him of course with his predecessor Bubba I guess it depends on says Dave is whiteful what your definition of morality is if lying is a moral then Bush really has nothing over Clinton Putting lied about his affair with monocle when scheme was nearly tossed out of offices the result is insistence They didn't have a relationship with that woman was pounced on by the likes of Kenneth Starter Republican majority in Congress and no fair Everything was worth the this cabal and it couldn't hiters among them see to this very day Somehow I'd rather have a president who lies about his personal sex life than one who lies to get us into a war where hundreds of American men and women die Thousands more suffer serious injuries and precious taxpayers dollars are squandered Religating programs for America's own needs to the back burner along with the real war on tear against Osama yama and al-Qaeda The only real casualties of Clinton's lies was on domestic relationship in the unfortunate impact on young monocle's own life If only Bush could say the same But lying has become pervasive among the bush crowd just a few days ago the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed That the administration purposely held back the true cost of the convoluted Medicare prescription drug bill from Congress No laws were broken. He said, but indeed Thomas Scully The administration's Medicare chief at the time is made the name Scully square after him threatened to have a fire medicair Act where I Richard Foster if he gave two cost figures to Congress when it was debating the bill Indeed the administration law Congress to act under false assumption that the cost of the Medicare bill would be $395 billion over 10 years when a new the real cost was $534 billion then a crash who fought the bill are outraged It sounds as though the Bush administration examined itself and put it in nothing wrong How to represented Pete Starker, California, and relation to Jim Stark who fought the bill for being too generous to the powerful Pharmaceutical operations but many Republicans aren't happy either and especially those who consider themselves physical conservatives the Question remains how many lies can this administration get away with? Not good man 30 thousand Just like they keep insisting. I mean Tony Blair comes out the other day It says well we are met well we never stole a freight train, but it was flawed intelligence and all that stuff We told it was a bunch of crap was all BS no weapons no threat no imminent threat no 40 five minute attack waiting It was all a bunch of crap, but we met well And they're still talking, Cheney and Bush.
