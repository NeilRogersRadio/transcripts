She Gordon-Liddy and they don't come anywhere spend meal rockers. This is the group and we're talking hobo on 560WQAM. Call me homey right here at 567H-O-O. Oh, 560. Call me homey. Let me talk to the Steve and Miami. Steve, you're with me. Warick, good night. Well, Crow, what did the marlins have to do to win the world series this year? Oh, that's an easy one, Steve. They got to swing the bat. Hit the bow. It's a strike. Remember, the game of baseball is 50% hitting. That's almost half. 50% feeling. 50% pension. And do it, Bob, as it managed him. But Crow, that's 175%. Why don't you be questioning me? Would you be ignorant? Be what? Hey, man. Hey, man, I said you'll be ignorant. Well, now I'm not ignorant. Fine. I'll play ball, pass you no baseball. In a dirt well-culti-gins, man, half my time. Did you? Well, actually I'm... Got it with it. I played it. Don't even know that. Are you gonna... Come on, you don't even know that. Can I be that stupid? Come on, me, homie. Out the Crow. I'll ride you. He's a bit... Shut up already. Well, I can't hear anything now. You really had messed this thing up big time. There was a little bit better not to bend. 10-02-560 WQM-Happy Thursday, too. How about those marlins? How about that? Learned a spell with Don Trowl, baby. Oh. Man, he's unbelievable. Three more hits. A tremendous towering, three run homer. The marlins off to a 7-1 start. Even George has pumped up and pissed off about it. Huh? Why was it in Puerto Rico? Some of your distant... What relatives? Yeah. Very distant. My ancestor's my dad. And anyway, it's a pretty sudden thing. I'm not jumping on the bad wagon because that would be hypocritical, but certainly anything good that can happen for this town because it needs it so badly, so desperately. Which is why there's so many people already bailing out. Got some bad news for mighty tractors out there by the way. I am gonna spell I for a little while. Yeah. What about how they would diagnose to exist today? One of our fine new sponsors? What a great place. You're fit as a fiddler? No. I wouldn't get that carried away. But they have all this new... It really is... I can't even describe it. But you're gonna take now, gee, that's where you like the... You lie on to the MRI thing. You know what that's like. If you've done that, no. Oh. Seeing pictures. Yeah, you just lie on a thing and they take a decent... Right. And they take all the pictures in it. It comes out on a computer. And they shoot you from like any inside of your throat and like the things in your neck and then down into your chest and your lungs. I mean, deep down into your lungs. Right. You told me they found some. Some one. Poop. Not on my lungs. No. Where it's supposed to be. I don't know. Star with it. But you're still sleeping. I don't know. Star with it. But you're still sleeping. You're still sleeping. You haven't even been on five minutes yet. And he's talking crap. You can't do that. Jesus, you just didn't get the memo, man. You can be between talking about what a great job. W didn't let the press conference get the night. Stick to the golf. Man dog, okay. Stay away from politics. You know what I don't understand? Trick number. Every that website where you look up and you can see how much anybody donate to a political candidate. Yeah. How come if man dog is such a big bush fan, he gave two grand above grand. I'm sorry. Sorry. Don't say that. Image. Just like John Schuillers, that what it's all about. I don't understand. Is it for that? That's your right. Wing image and behind a scenes. He gave two grand to Bob Graham. Right. It was last I remember was going to run against the bushmaster. Well, you ought to know real matter Republicans. So anyway, you could to look down through your lungs and your abdomen and through it like the inside. It's like a what was that movie? Interstase. No, no. Not a hard short. No, no. No, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. And you see your kidneys and you see everything it's inside there. And then of course, they do a separate one of your heart. And then they go down through your pupic. The downgers and no, they said, I don't have one. And they go to your pancreas and down to your liver with little bacon and onions. They stick in there for flavor. Colin, Colin, all of these things. It's not a the colonoscopy of the separate thing. The virtual colonoscopy. This is a lot less invasive. I didn't do that because I had a colonoscopy three years ago. Anyway, thanks to the folks over there. They were treated me very well. And it's a fabulous, oh, I'm sorry. It's a sensational thing. I don't want to say fabulous. We can't say fabulous. It's a little bit too, uh, fade. Is it what do you fade? Now, let's see, where do we start? We got so much crap going on. We've got a, that story about era America, man. It is just mind boggling. I mean, it is just, uh, what, what is there to say? I don't want to say I told you they had problems. I'm a better believe. Put down the LA engine counter winner and court try to get the, and they locked the door, changed the locks on the door. That is so sad. Kind of like if we showed up here a QA, I'm on morning and our key, you know, and our card didn't fit, you know? Really? They changed the, uh, key cards and like, uh, you know, we're here. Well, you can't get in here. It's a Chinese laundry now. Something like that. Oh, we got Margot Hemingway today. She's still dead. She shouldn't think. Oh, yeah, yeah, she is. What is it? What is it? Some of you just facts me for bananas. Mango has been in his foster. What does it mean? I know what they do that. Have they somehow, some kind of a golf hole or something like that? Talk about banana. I don't care because I mentioned bananas, fosters, so they sent me a recipe for mango has been in his foster, which I don't want. Thank you. So anyway, I'm pretty decent shape. I had a little, uh, calcification around a hard few places. And what they do is on a computer. And I sat with the doctor there who's really, uh, you know, you feel insufficient because most doctors are morons. You know, but this guy really knew his crap. Yeah. Seriously. And you feel like, kind of, am I stupid? And he takes you through the whole thing. And he's clicking on a computer and showing your various different angles and images and then the heart thing on there. And there's a little bit of calcification, but then they give you a score based on your age and your, uh, this and your diet and your attitude about life and your show this week is score bar. Right. And I scored 99. That's not like a, like a test score. But like a score based on averages of and that's pretty good. So that's like a hundred of my eyes. A plaque in there. Huh? 99 out of 100 of assuming. No, no, no, no, no. It's not based on, okay. So starts in zero, which would be perfect. And I, or it gets the worst it is. In other words, if you had like 400, uh, oh, you've got problems. If you got like higher than 400, extensive, atherosclerotic plaque, high likelihood of at least one, 400 or higher. I'm 99. So if I lose some weight of people stop shoveling food down my post and I could lose a little bit of that way. Not, I'm not going to ever be, you know, look quite like a bad pit close. Oh, speaking of that, what the hell is going on around here before we get into the heavy duty stuff today with my good friend, Moe, he is absolutely. I think he went to the OF. What? Carb. Uh, what is that? OFRC. Old fart rehab school. No, seriously, he just changes all I had to do. I haven't seen him. We haven't bonded this week. He gets out of here real fast. And I come in about eight, 15 when I'm pretty sure he's out of here. Because it's like awkward. You know, no, I think he realizes that. But on the air, he's been just, I, I don't know. I'm tempted to give it another shot in spite of all the crap you leave. You know, just for, for the coming early tomorrow and found a good karma kiss. Yeah. Now, do you think I know we've been through this a million times before it gets really pondered. But it seems like he really is making an honest effort. Now, I just naive. I'm eating. I'm always looking on the bright side. Oh. He is risen by the way. Oh, yeah. Hey, I'm not. Hey, Mo, I always forget him. Well, it's not forgiven. But we'll just start fresh. How's that? Clean slate. A clean slate with the old, old man. What do you say? Ah, okay. Still going to make this stuff. Oh, yeah. Well, he doesn't care about that. I think he's starting to get it a little bit about that stuff. He's starting to get it. Maybe he's just a little slow to warm up. Ha ha. Maybe that's it. He's a slow thought. Right. Man, he makes me look like Mr. Warms by comparison. But at any rate, what's that? What's that just going to say that you said? What do you just say? I had a thought there that was so damn important. Was it? Yeah. It was about health. No. Oh, I'm going to have to be boring. No, not about that. Well, what about? Let's go back. Anyway, here's the pull result from yesterday. And we are not doing that same pull again today. Oh, and it's a little, oh, I know what it was. It was about the thing I talked about Monday about my neighbors that had to flag his business. Which is that flag is gone. I guess it fell. But I was trying to think of a parallel. If I put a big banner on my fag pole in my house, a big flag up there that said, there is no God. Mm-hmm. I would never dream of doing that. I can't imagine any atheist that would do that. Because atheists generally tend to be like living, let live people, quit bugging me with your crap kind of people like me. But it would be so rude to everybody else in the neighborhood. Right? And I think that's the way to be inside my house and believe whatever it is I want, or not as a case may be. I don't have to use my religion as a weapon, which is the biggest problem in a world at least one of them is that all these idiots these lunatics, these morons, these stone age people, use their religion as a weapon to beat people over to head with. Because they care about what time they're going to hate them and disgrace them and humiliate them and whatever. That's for your own good. I see. But don't you think that's pretty good parallel? I think we're better up there. That said, there is no God. People, I feel, oh, I feel crazy. Look at that. You feel just as crazy. Look at your religious bubble. I see, okay. So cut the crap. They want to, if you want to put a little generic Easter bunny thing on, you know, book and Christmas, fine. You know, decorations. Who were you to tell us? But there's a difference between decorations and spewing your religious, uh, hoax, poke a superstition. Stop it already. That's one of the biggest problems in this country is that people haven't been taught to be tolerant of other people. Oh, but it's a pluralistic society. Well, maybe the ones upon a time it was not no more. That's since we got this. Maybe classic example of that. I get a letter in a mail, which is very rare here. I get letter this morning. It's real thick and it's got 87,000 pages in it. And, uh, it's from a phony, a Dread Gav, not even a name is the return in Dread Gav in for a lot of y'all scrolled with the phony address. And here's a, it starts out the first page and there's a whole bunch of these pages which are already in a circular file. And I see a very familiar picture. And it's a picture of phony up, doctored picture with Carrie speaking with Jane Fonda. And we already brought, but through that, months ago, we had it on the website. And it's a doctored picture. She wasn't anywhere anywhere near that to scene. And then it says this was a man who had an alliance with the trees and queen herself, meaning Jane Fonda was famous for befriending the enemy. It's a phony picture. So what do you need to read after that? And you're dealing with the randlings of a right-wing lunatic. This is what we're up against. These people are crazy people. And take it over to country, which is why we can't say crap. We can't make farting sounds. We can't do anything. That's the kind of crap that they're worried about. It's farting sounds. People are dying every day. We got murder and bloodshed all over the place, but we're worried about drugs and we're worried about pornography and dirty words because they're so dirty. And these are the same people and put those things out there. Want to beat us over the head with their religion. Believe it. Whatever you want, I have no problem with it. Just don't beat me over to head with it. And just don't put those stupid bumper stickers on your car. That's all part of it too. My boss is a Jewish carpenter. Oh great. Karen are Richard. See, their religion dictates that they had another carbon. That's a Jewish. 12 minutes. If she had just eaten it, oh, I was trath. That's why she would eat that pastrami and Swiss. Kosher kills. Kosher kills? Hmm. That's a good. 12 minutes after 10 at 5, 60 WQM, you've heard about the big demand at high pay potential for computer professionals. Have you wondered if this career is for you?

sign of a quick resolution Arthur Lou what do he's can do uh what's your name does he look no no what the one we had on the website Lucy Lou I'll be dang I love Lucy Lou Arthur Lou that's L.I.U. owner of multi-cultural radio broadcasting which owns america video to W.N.T.D. 950 in Chicago and K.B.L.A. in Los Angeles said air america bounce to check and it was in more than a million dollars air america multi-cultural head entered new agreement which the network essentially was writing multi-cultural air time Lucid see originally when it gives this whole i.R. america thing oh we're gonna buy stations in all the major market they're gonna buy stations they forgot to mention rexical exon and shibran and said clear and B.P they bounce to check today said Lou it's a default they paid only a very small portion of what they owe us they bounce to check he says he declined to say how much multi-cultural's O.B. did say he's holding a million dollars in text that air america's and asked the company not to cash air america chairman Evan cool and call the allegations and outright lie multi-cultural radio broadcasting's conduct and this matter's been disgraceful co-in said it is a clear violation of their contractual obligations but a spuley zero america star up network in a business that favors right wing personalities and is dominated by jank and glamourates and a tenuous position the described here in the chicago trip there's a thirteen markets nationwide in chicago's in Los Angeles nearly eighteen million combined list news constitute thirty seven percent of america's potential audience it would be like if we were like taken off here with an about a fifty block radius of where they can hear the station like from here up to like county line road and then what would we do then LA in chicago the second and third largest markets in the country typically are regarded as essential when try to sell national radio ads if the spule becomes mired in court it is unclear when america might reappear in those two markets air america file complaint wins the new supreme court charging multi-cultural with breaching its contract and seeking an injunction to put america back in the chicago station and america source and a separate lawsuit over the L.A. station is coming the network also uses radio stations in New York Minneapolis Portland or again in elsewhere as platforms to attack a new executive vice president general council David good friend appeared on america's Randy roadshow to accuse the will of essentially stealing from america by reselling airtime on kbl a third parties that network already purchased in the woods and it like bait and swish right we're going to said you like uh... ten annune and we got self-assumptus somebody else kind of like what you and teny favorite do what i'm kind of good friends at the dispute centers on the L.A. station during the period after america started leasing airtime in early February but before launched in late march during that time he said kbl a was broadcasting spanish language program provided by multi-cultural spanish language program good friends at the last week that will do in multi-cultural had been doubled dipping kind of like duck and clearance doubled dipping song that same airtime to others as a result he said the network to find a make payments for kbl a less multi-cultural credit their america for the extra money that multi-cultural made america did not bounce any checks he said those lion bastards are something like that they sent us an email asking us to immediately restore it and go back to negotiating table who said but there's nothing to negotiate the OS the money media media observers say this becomes a crucial time for the start up network what an understanding this certainly doesn't help a fledgling station that were said pola hambrick who owns media buying from hambrick an associates in orland park the president had a press conference last night so he assumed a lot of people would have wanted to hear what i'll fracking at the say this is when they're really trying to garden an audience shikago area listeners who tune in the w t n t d nine fifty ones they

he's a best i could watch a bullying for colombine and all his stuff and read his bush is all day and it's been running around cabal lately for those of you who bullying for colombine yes it has seen at many many times now about to be a man the part i like his when he says how come time it oj so black no he didn't say that anyway says a friend's i've never seen a head so far up a presidential ass part my philuca then the one i saw last night is the news conference given by George W. Bush he's still talking about finding weapons of mass destruction this time on saturday bush you closed down a friggin weekly newspaper you great give her a freedom and democracy then all close the paper at only ten thousand readers why are you smoking maybe he's the smurking chimp one year after we wipe the face of saturday with our american flag before yanking him down it is now too dangerous for a single media person to go to that square and bag that and follow report on the wonderful one year anniversary celebration of course there is no celebration those who brave blowdried imbeds can't even leave the safety of the fort in downtown bag that they'll never actually see what is taking place across back most of the pictures we see on tv are shot by the air of media and some Europeans when you watch report from a record you're getting is the press release handed up by the was occupation force and repeated u.s news i currently have two camera and reporters doing work for me in a rack for my movie unbeknownst to be at army they're talking to soldiers and gathering the true sentiment about what's really going on they fed x the footage back to me each week that's right fed x who said we have a rough feed him to a rack the funny stirmy guys tell me is how when they find a bag that they don't have to show passport or go through immigration why not because they haven't traveled from a foreign country they're coming from america to america a place that is ours a new american territory called a rack there's a lot of talk amongst bush's opponents that we should turn this war over the u.n. why should the other countries of the swirled countries who try to talk us out of this folly now have to clean up our mess i oppose the u.n. anybody else risking lives of their citizens to us extract us from this debacle i'm sorry but the majority of america and support of this war once it began and sadly that majority must now sacrifice their children until up blood has been let that may be just maybe god in the rackie people will forgive us in the end until then enjoy the pacification of fuluga the containment of sottar city and the next teta fence of ubsamin terrorist attack by small grab a group of batheslor list high love writing these word batheslor list makes me sound so peter jinnings followed by a news conference where we will be told that we must stay the course because we're waiting the hearts and minds of the people all right again soon don't despair remember the american people are not that stupid sure we can be frightened in a war but we always come around sooner or later and the one the one way this is not like the anonymous that it hasn't taken a public for long years to figure out they were lied to now bush with just quit speaking in public and give me more free material for my movie i can get back to working get a dot i got four weeks left to completion this is my more next one Michael Michael what a second rate Michael more fair and high nine eleven that's coming out this summer i'll be first in line coming out late this summer also coming out this summer allegedly is a very flimp book that's going out ill president he is the liar in hypocrite and abortion the lover that he really is forget these books they need to make movies not to be a see people's only by the uh... bill or rally book and the uh... mad fudge book and the right way in books right in the american rom they can read no books no i'm gonna go to the movies though specialt they show some action right you don't think they're gonna allow that movie to be shown fact when i'm hearing is that jepcon just came with our campaign free die peccie who look at the house like that he just got out of the show when he was busy doing the his uh... f***ing routine i can't see the oh you know what who did i hear used that word on the area is that was in mad dog yeah uh... word no it's a i'm gonna have to do on the air seminars because between clearance and moth they just can't convey to the sports people we have on the i think you're he was talking about master bation and i heard a son of a back uh... can do that no more mad dog he also said the p i were that can do that you're denial of the standard he's what the sports standard right well i did i did get to list though the list for this show and the list for the arrest of the station once it do sports right they'll pretend i think we can do it in the market taking off here is because they just wouldn't go step in line and talk sports don't you think that sports was the reason that for the demise of that phony baloney about the some picture on a website that's garbage right they just a wooden go step in line and do the old or seen and so how to look at it on this radio station the only reason we fit in his cousin number one i got a real good contract and number two i make it in a lot of money right that and that's it no other reason they don't like to show they don't like uh... the content they don't like the fact that we're not obsessed with it's for you know even i know more about a lot of stuff and they'll ever know including how bad the leaves played against the wall last night and about how sundeen and uh... joleneu and i curb of tourists they don't know any of this the fact if that's undine walked in here right now it is leaves you to form i'm wearing the number thirteen there's a better chance that you would know who he was then uh... anybody in this building except me the following saying i do but i think that i know that we'll let you know they would say it would be saying oh number thirteen that must be damn marino now do you think that the sweet with his blonde short blonde here pretty are big on you think that match and he looks like damn marino i

right behind the rumors very soon well I'm going to be coming in for some females too Randy wrote she's uh only on there now right no no she's on jn all or whatever that whatever that station is in

government let disaster happen the revelation came yesterday morning when c.i.i. director George tenet was on the stand Tim Rolmer a former democratic congressman asked him when he first found out about the report from the FBI's Minnesota field office that's the curious moussawi in his lomic jihadists have been taking lessons how to fly 747 tenet replied that he was briefed about the case august 23 or 4th 2001. Rolmer then asked tenet if he mentioned moussawi to present bush at one of their frequent morning briefings tenet replied I was not in briefings at this time bush he noted was on vacation he added that he didn't see the present at all in august 2001 during the entire month bush with it was at his ranch in Texas he never talked with him or more asked no tenet replied by the way from august 10 and two was as he put it on leave and there he had it national security adviser condolese arises made a big point of the fact that tenet briefed the present nearly every day yet at the peak moment of threat the two didn't talk at all at a time when action was needed in order to fraction of come from the top the man was at the man at the top was resting under stirbed he was on a ranch he's he's been on over 500 vacation days in uh... what is it three years just over three years over two even i don't get that much vacation time and i'm pretty peo about it too thanks rocko this is a great to be snank you man when i have the american people gonna finally wake up in sniff the daffodils and then you got like my good friend of mad dog on their state talking about how he watched the he watched the person dead and he thought pretty good company good and i noticed silence from the other room at that point silent more than a say what are they going to say quit something to the right mad dog i think they right i'm here and i'm here in the same thing that they said nothing sounds a silence i know what they could say at least grab what i'm just in that if you weren't out can you explain another thing to me i know that everybody fails another easter and pace off or over that this town is like a ghost town but this building i don't understand yeah i mean it seems like we're on permanent vacation it's just uh... let's just go to Steve Tyler the whole album permanent vacation everybody is always on vacation now i think they're trying to learn by example for me i'm only one supposed to be on permanent vacation i'm a dot-wing old uh... fact but these people it isn't a place of business it's like a ghost town well how about Greg is great here this all he's on vacation again and but but we got all these uh... things well great he will be you know he's on vacation because he knows i'm here he checked that counter guaranteed i'm gonna sneak in one of these times when i know these here i'm gonna sit right outside his office jump out of him from your own like a little long there and just sit there with his guys on shades of beard i'm bar almost peace i'm so tired we're so tight twenty seven past eleven at five sixty q a m now with your sportsятно fight sixty do you work do Tu by way man Oh, yeah, great. There's a fight for all the ages. It's a fight for all the rest. Great. What's going on? Now all of you. Good that out. Good. Get the carl to sit here. Okay. It's better when you suffer, right? What is it, though? How's it? You've painted the jingle balls and reception board. Not anybody else here. Well, who better to represent an all-day sport-hole station? And be side. She frightens me. All right, everyone. Let's break this up right now or I'll show you my ball. Yeah. Come out of here. Get him out. I'm ready. Back. 1132 at 560 at WQM. We got Marla's baseball at 2 o'clock. Man, they were on fire at her 7 or 1. And they just, uh, it's an amazing thing. Even I'm starting to lighten up. And that's what I'm trying to burn a band. And I don't care about baseball. But at least you got to hand it to a man. They've done the right thing. The organization has opposed to some of the other organized. They've done the other organizations in this town and around the country. They've done the right thing. They've built a juggernaut. And everybody's like, Glomin' on a wooden moths to be a part of it and squeeze it and everything else. Which I think is fine. No TV today again from Puerto Rico from San Juan. So you can see the Marlins pound the crap out of a little league Montreal expos at 2. Uh, you can hear it at 2.35. Pre-Game of 2. See it on your radio. See it on your radio. Take a look and boy, you'll go to Newcoma. If you need an app, Dave Ann Boyn will be doing a game until boot comes on. Dave Ann Boyn, he is just Colonel. I mean, Boog is a little rock and rolly, but he's got a lot of cliches. That's true. They've got to call him ripped him that day, but he's good. He puts him like seven into what he's enthusiastic. He's a living and breathing person. Not some fothyl man with a bad hairpiece. Anyway, Alan, one of our regular facts, who says the small print on Lipitor says not showing to prevent heart disease or heart attacks on the ads. So what's the point? The point is that the people will make it Pfizer and Merck and all these other pharmaceutical giants. That's the point that they want to make billions and billions of dollars and they want to fleece the American public as much as they can. It's fases they can until they find out that some of these things kind of like the lutimide. Remember that Eli Lilly? Yeah, the fripper. Because all sorts of grotesque and horrendous things. And of course your doctors probably get in a lot of nice trips and vacations and maybe you can read once in a while, whatever. Because he's peddling all that. Those are for seven to so core and things like that. All of these things. Also, Alan says, eramercas on a key west on 1500 WKIZ. Honors sure will ask Friday, Randy said she learned everything she knows about talk radio from Neo Rogers in Miami. And thanks very much, Randy. And you're right. And number two, I'm sure glad I'm not on eramercas. I'll do I think about it. I could just imagine after investing all of these years in this business waking up yesterday morning and discovering. Oh, that's what you're not on Chicago where I lay today. And they like to doors in Chicago. All the door opens. Yeah, next week maybe New York and maybe, yeah. See, they have a skeleton crew. They just have a board-ops sitting in the other markers. I'm your laughing. They're not broadcasting people. I want to understand. It's kind of like one step away from from seven ninety from waxes seven nights. One step away from that. They basically have least the time on these stations. So that they could put these programs on the earth. I thought I want to say. And if they wind up on some kind of a problem like they have in Chicago and LA and who knows where else then they ain't on here and they got to go to court. And who knows if they really have the money or not? I don't think I really need that at this stage of my not so good luck, Randy. Wow. And worse comes to work. She can always come back to her. Right. Welcome home. Right. Welcome home. No problem. Now this fact bothers me because I didn't say anything about the statin drugs. Did I? You didn't hear me saying that. I didn't hear it. Because this dessert could you please. See, I'm not a doctor. I just give my opinions. I don't want anybody to start taking something or stop taking something. Just because I got a big mouth here. I'm not prescribing. I haven't totally unqualified to be doing that. I'm just quoting things that I've written that I believe very strongly about the butchers in the medical profession. Okay. Most of what to then they are. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Doctor. Would you like to come and butcher me up today? No, but I'll come over and see you. All right. I'll kill some good time, Doctor. Hello. I have to wait a couple of hours. Oh, that's great. I have nothing else going on anyway. Bring my knitting. Yeah. I'm a professional victim. Maybe you can tell me I got something bad. Oh. Neo, could you please restate the name of the book about stands? I'm currently on Crest Door, which did lower my cholesterol from 4.95 to 220, but I would really prefer not to be. And it's not my diet. I'm only a year old from triple bypass surgery. Definitely don't want to go through that again. Thanks. I really appreciate it. Here's somebody who's been through triple bypass surgery. And the year away from going through it again, they're asking me for advice. No, no, sir. That was you all the best. I hope you don't have to go through it again. But please, please. Find a real doctor. Okay. Get a search part in on sight easier. Find a real doctor. Please. I beg you. The name of the book is. Well, we don't know what it is. I used to. By a Kilmer McColley call. And it's not a book about cholesterol. It's a book about heart and heart disease and about all these things. And he's got a section toward the back of the book about these statin drugs. And he just rips them and asks them to tell you that there are a lot more data. And he's also. Well, I'll find it. Kilmer, what is it in Kilmer? Kilmer McColley. Well, why don't you do a search on why you're saying they're picking you nose? Because I got a good one. No, but the reason I I mentioned the trans fatty acids because I had a story that I never got to, which is very boring. Nobody wants to hear it. But it's it's important stuff. It's about a local doctor. Dr. Michael D. Osner and the Gables. This was where was this where I find the somewhere. Years before trans fats made into the public radar. Miami cardiologist Dr. Michael D. Osner was calling them a major health hazard. And telling his patient to avoid foods containing that fat. And Dr. Bob rest in peace. Dr. Rackens. Another one. It was screaming about trans fatty acids and how they will kill you. And how they were a hell of a lot worse for you than all this business about cholesterol and about Zokor and lipatore and all these stanton drugs. And also homo-system, which this a Kilmer McColley didn't he discover homo-system? I'm pretty sure he did. I'll take your word for it. Yeah, no, he did. This isn't just some slet that wrote another book like Dr. Fula pretends to be a diet guru. I was wobbling around with a big fat pupic. Anyway, Dr. Osner says of the three types of fat trans fats are the worst of the lot. Of saturated unsaturated trans fat, Osner is medical director of well-less and prevention at Baptist Cardiac and Vascular Institute. He was persuaded by the evidence showing trans fats lower good or hl cholesterol, increased bad or ldl cholesterol, so quit eating and cookies and potato chips and french fries, George. Trans fatty acids, they'll kill you to bad or poison. Yeah, yeah. While doctors still know no exactly how trans fats were if they do know they can reach significant damage, Harvard's landmark study of more than 80,000 nurses found that just replacing 30 calories, or 7 grams of carbohydrate each day with 30 calories or 4 grams of trans fats, nearly double the risk of developing heart disease. Oh my god, that hurts. You hear that? Again, they found that replacing just 30 calories, or 7 grams of carbohydrates each day with 30 calories or 4 grams of trans fats, nearly double the risk of developing heart disease. There are poison. There are two. I don't know which one. This is the only one on the one. The homocysteine revolution. That's it. And the heart revolution. I don't know which one it is. Well, get a both. No, no, seriously, he did guys fantastic. He's out for extending. Oh, he's out the fucking stand out. That's worse. He's out. Fucking standing. No, he is. Well, I don't like this. That sounds too, I don't know. It just makes you feel like big brother is listening and watching, which he probably is very like. He's out. Standing. The first one was the heart revolution. Right. Homocysteine revolution must have come out subsequently. I see. Well, no, seriously, if you're taking that full look acid, not just plain full look acid, but we'll come out with a B vitamins, which I've been taking that for a long time. That's going to bring the, I'm telling you, give me that look. I know give me that place. Look, it brings your homo level away down. How much more Macho I am since I started taking that formula. How about if I just take a sentiment, go for it. We just give it to our programming people. We'd really be in good shape. We could butcher this place up a little bit. A freaky curl. That's why I'm moist the time. It's takes a lot of homo. Yeah. He's a lot of homo, alright. About 210 pounds of creepy homo. It's a 20-ton. 20-ton, no, not five-60. Oh, by the way, I wonder if he has pink eyes. Oh, I am low. This is portraying five-60. You way am. Good, good. You know, when you're not feeling like yourself. I feel like Dennis Franz today. And I have men, brats. You may feel sad. Hopeless. And lose interest in things you once love. Sparkey. I feed you a poop. I feed you a poop. Why don't you just curl up and die. You feel the activities in relationships suffer. Hi, Mary. Hi, honey. What's up? I'm Max Twink. Forget it. You're a heinous bloke pig. These are some symptoms of depression. Depression may be related to an imbalance of naturally occurring chemicals. The goal of works to correct this imbalance. Side effects may include dry mouth and somnia.

It's not like they're not capable of it. Even though Jeff has fed the building many times. Right. That's right. At least you can do for Jeff Cohen who's fed this building a million times. Got all that food. And you people sitting around here lazy. Well, we don't have anybody in the building. We'll skip you might do it because you know. Oh, yeah. I can see skipping change in the tire. Right. By the way, when you finish running over Todd Drek with right side tires. Right over skip you. I can just see it two for one deal. Man. Let me make a lot of our problems here at QAM. Here's our poll today on theorages.com. Which we got to lovely dead Margo Hemingway on there while she was still alive and looking pretty decent. Which of these people offend you the most religious fanatics to 161. That was my vote. They make me speak. Can't stand them. They are the bane of human existence. The root of all evil in the white wing or the 100. Chris is a lot of slopp over from what he had a voice to in over. That's okay. Figure out, you know, old Jews 23 and old Cubans 21. It seemed to be like right side by each where they belong. Right. Liberals 13, Blacks 13, 806, Golf and at X4, 4 Golf and at X4. I'm listening. Uh, what else we got? Haitian drivers three to make in his two sports nerds to in computer nerds. Finally got one out of 454. Wait till you're this. More Michael Jackson bad news. Bad news from the New York Daily News from the front page section. Liberathe's ex adds to Jacko's woes. Michael Jackson is lashing out at a former lover of Liberathe's who claims to have had an affair with Jacko. Scott Thorson 45 says he twice had rumps with the gupped one, surely we were splitting with Liberathe in the early 80s. I think what he's trying to say is Michael, You're gay. Jackson's it. I know that pains you greatly though. No, no, I love that. Jackson's attorney Steve Cochrane tells us Thorson's story is false track. You know what it's thursday. And you know what I forgot? That's because that was the track last night. I didn't pick up the inquire. So this is another reason I cannot be here. Maybe skip you'll bring that to. Yeah, sure you will. After he's finished changing the tire for Jeff Cohen, he'll bring me the national inquire from all. I bet you try to over here while green sure. Somebody will drop by the inquire. So I can be the whole store because this is just a short blur of the news. New York Daily News. The national inquire where Thorson makes his claim reports that he passed a polygraph test and is ready to testify in the singer's travel station case about his relationship with Michael Jackson. Thorson believes he could prove useful to prosecutors of Jackson's lawyers assert that their client is thoroughly heterosexual and thus would have no interest in boys. Thorson says that after meeting Jackson in 1979, Vegas, the two had their first sexual encounter in a London apartment. Thorson, a former model says he was trying on some new clothing. When Jackson motioned over to the bed where the singer was lounging. He contends that they had another trist to follow him after a dinner party. Michael felt comfortable to make the first move on. I mean I didn't resist, Thorson. Michael beg me to leave La Barracia had to say, No. Thorson admits in the inquire that La Barracia evicted him from their early home in 1982 after Thorson became addicted to painkillers and other drugs. Thorson later sued La Barracia for Palamoni. Maybe now we can move in with Raj. Huh? Maybe kind of turn him around. Thorson claims he saw Jackson often on over the next few years. He doesn't say off or on what. Twice he claims he saw gay porn mags on Jackson's nightstand, once with pictures that look like young boys. Cockburn reacted angly to Thorson's allegations saying we reserve our right to seek the appropriate remedies against any person who makes this claim. Cockburn, we're not saying about him in this story. Oh, Steve Cockburn. I said, as soon as that's our cockburn, I thought about Johnny Cockburn. Who we used to call Johnny. I'm gonna show what we want any more for obvious who. Steve Cockburn said it's all trash. Of course, I mean, it's trash. Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Right. I mean, come on. In fact, I think it's time for another big party at Neverland. You might move back in for a day to say, throw to the big bash. Put on a happy face. And then I, of course, that you're gay. Right. Let me just tell you right now, folks. Anybody who denies that they're gay, they're the ones believe you me. The ones who are always pointed to fingers. Those who are rattling the, the spears. Oh, and speaking of a gay, Linda Mara, what's your name? Lisa Roy Presley, Linda Marie. Okay. Lisa Marie, she finally fest off. I had this on a couple of weeks ago, did I about to dig a fierce? And then she joined the Scientologist. Of course, it does the classic. Yeah, just a question. It relevant. Tom Cruise, John Revoltah, all of these people, were always holding press conferences and swing people to make sure that everybody understands that they're not gay. Right? Absolutely. Right. They're all Scientology. I understand the next of the Catholic Church, it's the biggest closet in the world. As I want to hear, I could be wrong. It's Ruby. They got room for more. No, and if you have a roommate, they'd like to find out who it is and what they look like. And will they cooperate? Anyway, five, six that we haven't taken any calls here today. Just a couple and two hours. I feel like I've let this crowd down. Have I? I've enjoyed this so far. It's been good. It's been fantastic. Except for the part with Jeff. That was fine. So he's a good guy. He's just a show killer. Not as much so as Rimmer though. Oh, what a hockey stuff. Wow. Which of these people offend you the most religious fanatics? 275 out of 478. Right, Wringers 1027 old Cubans 25 old Jews 23. Don't be a yenta. Liberals 14 and Blacks 14, 807. Golf, Golf, and that Explorer. And drivers 4 Jamaicans 2 sports nerds 2 and computer nerds 1. I probably should have said impereous to makins. Let's you make him win. Yeah. I don't think that you make him men are like that, are they? I don't know what that meant. No, but the Jamaican women, it's always a, but that phony, a very British style accent, you know, kind of look another nose at you. Anyway, here's one from Charlie and dear field beach who keeps making. Making his name smaller and smaller because he's embarrassed to be in such a chronic. He's hooked out and he can't stop. Can't stop. He's all right. He's good. He's an excellent factor. He says in the off chance, you haven't already heard about it mentioned red analyzed transfer rejoiced over the article. The path to war in this month's vending for magazine, which I have heard about and have a right yet. I thought I'd just bring it to your attention. It's a bit long, but definitely worth reading. See, that's another thing I got to get is this month's vending affair. Because that's a long and inditing article about what went on there and the reason we went to war in our rack. And all these people have done. He has that too. I won't be just got banned in the fair and I guarantee they got that new inquire. Comes under me Thursday. Well, at least I hope it does. Why is it? I still don't understand. They publish all of tabloids in land 10. Right. We could throw a brick from here to land 10. Probably would be a good idea. And then they probably spoke it. Mm-hmm. No, it's just that we could throw a whole bunch of baseballs tightly wound. Right. Who the ones and now that they took it away from Haiti, we'll have to find out. And that's how close land 10 is. But for whatever the reason is the tabloids, I get them faster in Toronto than I get him here. Why is that? Like trying to find a fresh orange at the store. They're grown here. Yeah. And you can probably find them in the Oshoa Ontario. Right. Fresher than you can get them here. Right. Same thing with the back. Or maybe in maybe in the... Iron City. I thought the weed came in through here. Right. Try to find a reasonably priced bag. Or maybe in Canotia. 560560. Everybody was constant? Yes. Never been there. See there you go. You got me on that. Not sure. Did the bus thing. You know. Back off. Never been to Wisconsin. A lot of beard renkers there. A lot of German sausages. Lot of Nazis. 560560560. Haiti, Haiti, Haiti.

So now he's like back at it again today. See? These people out there, they're reaching out. They're like, they're like longing, searching, desperately trying to bond with the rest of the human race and using us as a vicarious extension. Through whom they can reach out to mankind. See what I'm saying? Are we? Rick says notice how Cheney is disappeared again. I wonder if they're trying to hide him from the campaign. Carey, carey, he's our man if he can't do it. We'll move to Canada. Costa Rica sounds good too, says Rick. Costa Rica. See? All the way to know about those line of work companies. I guess Central America is okay for now. I want to hear more about Belize. Belize? See? They like their bow-arboned Belize, please. I heard it's kind of cosmopolitan. There's a lot of different kinds of people living there. But if you go there, they might just seize your asses. There's one on the coast there, the weather's there. Costa Rica, they might seize your asses. That's too. There's what I hear. 560, 560, pound, 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Live. We got screenless here. Look at that response. There's nobody here anymore. Where'd they go? Canada? Anywhere. No, no, this is every year it's a little bit earlier. They just bail on us. Bail on you. WQAM, hello. Yeah, I talked to Neil. Speaking. Hey, I mean, I want to talk to you. I really don't care, although I'm not sure if I ended by you and I was sure I don't care if the FAC Heratasy. Yeah. I think that I think your show was poising. I think Miami would be a better place without you on the area. No, why are you listening to it? Why are you listening to it? Why are you listening to it? Get some new material. Why are you listening to it? Get some new material. Get a life. 560, you know, that was a so fake man. It's a tragic. Perfect. Get some new material. Let's poison. We'd be better. But get some new material. Then it won't be so much poison. Probably a friend of Reverend Jones. Probably his boyfriend. Come to QAM, hello. Neil, for that last golf, I get your call. Yes. I'm the fuck off. Okay. That was cute. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T of Verizon Wireless Line. Now, see he was already ringing a phone, but I guess he was so inspired by the previous golf hold I called. Not golf bag. He was a golf full. No, no, no, no. Golf full. WM-Hello. Yes sir. Oh, you're a family. WM-Hello. Yes sir. You're not an influencer. I said, you're a regular police. You can't talk to me. You're not saying anything calls right now. Okay. Thank you. You're sorry. WM-Hello. Oh, hello. Would you like to hear about, please? Sir, please, please. Please. Please.

What languages do we have to choose from in the lead? French? English. Really? Yeah, they're taking lessons. They speak Spanish. Why the law? Why are they taking lessons? They're educated in English. They're educated in English. And the Guatemalan sin, their families over to learn English. Huh. And do laundry. It's wonderful. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm going to be a great one. Please. I'm going to be a great one. Please. And maybe just as a way of saying, give her ice squeezed. You could think I saved that. InterTube. 560, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Alright, thank you. I'm a pleasure. I think you want to die. Here's a greeting from Miami. Whaaah! WQAM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Happy Thursday, Tusser. I want to put two people on your pole. Two people on a pole. Yes. Which of these people offend you the most, okay? Okay. White people. White people. And Batman. What was the other one? Batman. Adam Ant. Batman. Oh, Batman. Batman. Batman. Batman. Yes, that. That's a kind of words, uh, a song for our G. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, we sure don't have no of those around here. Batman. Batman. Oh, we can put that on there. Thanks. White people and things. And he's especially don't like white flags. Because we know for sure to ain't no, uh, uh, uh, Fag whatever he is. Yeah, that's for damn sure. Which he's not too happy about because he's looking desperately to find one. Okay, Pali will put that on a pole. Right your name on a T-room wall and full number. Or put it on there like that. Well, the Fags are gay. Yeah, I don't know. Fags. WQAM. Hello. Neil. Let's call in the people. Golf holes. Can we call the room? WQAM. Hello. Hey, young. Okay. Hang on a second, Pali. Now Jeff Cohen came back to the fish you tire. Working on it. They showed up for us or just, oh, Son of a, it's we didn't do any good. But we can't always, we can't bet a thousand. There's nobody around on to understand. There's nobody here now. Right. So, Tair King is right across the street. Jeff had a in this human hot weather. We had to walk all the way across the street. How many feet is that? About 30 feet over there on the other side of the street. On, uh, whatever that is, 441. Without a hat. Without a hat, no less to protect him from that blazing and furrow of a sun. And get the Tair King to people to change his tear. They're working on it right now. So you missed your 11 30 with that hooker in, uh, in the hallendale. I guess maybe you've been making it in time for your 12 30. Every hour on the hour. It's the shower of power. It's older to hope the phone. Okay. Hold on. Okay. Here's somebody who was holding on. Hello. Hey, I'm Kornin. Yes, you're sorry about that. But Jeff Cohen had a problem. Yeah, I understand. Life is the, is the bit of a millionaire. And the only thing that's been going on with the key diddy and ODB. The one where about 30 comes from is that one. One of the illegal ones you can play anymore. Oh, I don't know. I have no life. About 30 man. That one, yes sir. Why wouldn't we be able to play that? Oh, I don't know. I was just wondering you haven't played it. See if he would say about if we played about 69. He couldn't say that. About 30 man. Yeah, you got to write there. There we go. In fact, we'll play a 30 time. About 30 man. About 30 man. About 30 man. About. Five six seven. Five six. Five six. This is the part of the show that we love when a really amateur starts coming from the audience. Well, they look. They're under a lot of stress. They're being abandoned. Everybody with like more than 50 bucks in your pocket. Who is capable of doing his bailing out. I still say that that tells you everything you need to know about this area. I mean, it's, it's not like the weather is insurphably. In fact, it's pretty. Since all I'd rain and crap in the last couple of days, it's beautious. Nice and cool. Cool. Sonny Shannon and on a cloud in the sky. If you live like, between an orange and an ojas. And what's not to like, you know, but the fact of the matter is they're getting out while the getting is good. See what I'm saying? But it's now up north. It's starting to get like, you know, 55, 60 maybe in some places 70. So I think what they're really trying to say is, hey, guess what? I'd rather be up here. In fact, if the weather was like a 65, 70, 75 all year up here, we never see your ice down there. It's what they're trying to say. And of course, a lot of you would say, well, that's good. Well, that's good. Stay in the way, you know, as a way of rationalizing the deficiencies of the area in which we live. You live. Did you say, Aryan? Yes, nation. WM-ho. Niel. Yes, sir. Hey, do I'm paling? Pretty good. Paling, what's up? Not too much. I have two additions to your pole. Oh, boy. Go ahead. Physical fitness nuts. Physical fitness nuts like Jeff Cohen is one. And figure out smokers. Well, that's an interesting combination. Yeah, I think so. They're kind of opposite. Okay. Cover some of the territory. Thanks, paling. Thank you. Have a great day. Figure out smokers and the physical fitness nuts. Physical fitness freaks. No, because generally physical fitness nuts are freaks. And there's one sitting right in there. Take a look at him, man. Oh, brother. Whew. Hey, it's 11 past noon speaking of the pizza loft. The one and only. See, that's why I came back in. He probably sneak to peek at the log when it was in here before. I'm not putting you on to impellish this spot. Now, what's this about no BS coupons like they're the joints? Because the pizza loft offers every Thursday like today, a special where you buy any on-ter and the second one is half price. Every Tuesday at the loft when you buy one, every time dinner, the second one's only five bucks. Again, you don't need no phony coupon. Every week they do this. Every Monday, you buy one, listen, dinner, the second one's only five bucks. And again, no coupon. That's necessary because it isn't just like all of it for days, the fourth of each month, the between now and next circus. It's all the time. And of course, the great formula for this success of pizza loft is because they're consistent in Jeff's days out of your way and out of your hair. He's out getting late all day. It's the only restaurant in the country with no microwave and everything is either baked or sauteed. They give you gigantic fresh portions, everything is delicious. Three different kinds of great pizza, the best garlic rolls you ever had. And because they've got over 200 seats, you don't have to stand online and a weekend to wait to get seated and start just chopping down on that good stuff. They also have to pizza loft delivered at St. Great Menu from, let's see, all over the place. West all over the flamingo road north to sunrise Boulevard south to Pines Boulevard. East to 441 draw on a map. And of course, they do great catering too for any affair you may be having. And believe me, Jeff knows as affairs for his little just five bucks per person. You'll find a world famous pizza loft going strong there in Davy between five 95 and Griffin Road on the University of Drawer at Beyond Peerwood. In ports tons and tons of free parking. Here's the number to call it Jeff knows his numbers. Call 9 5 4 9 1 6 88 80. In fact, if he goes in one slow a bit slow, like you know, 3 30 and the afternoon one's an off time and Jeff happens to be there. He'll regal you with lots of great stories I'm sure. 95 4 9 1 6 88 80 for the world famous pizza loft in Davy. My life and love this is 4 236. You way too way. Rectom. I see some I change.

thanking you for giving us the real truth about the world these days and anyway I wanted to call about passions yeah what is the deal with Theresa are you getting sick of her I got sick of her about a year ago yeah once you were squirting the big heavy duty crocodile tears all the time she was squirting a few she is the biggest penny has but you gotta understand every character run at show is cleverly designed to aggravate and infuriate those of us who are desperate enough to watch it everything just the every like a alustr you know alustr crane right who has all the hand motions always ringing the hand uh one good thing about him though is he smoking he's changed smoking so many of those big stories so probably have a gigantic tumor pretty soon although now what do you think that oh

days they kill some real good time with that and he finally pulls the trigger and you see Louise drop the big stack of all those secret CDs and uh this and then you see on the picture behind Louise you see blood spatter so you probably you know nick them on the elbow yeah probably right probably one of the my favorite things that I show is when there's a scene when you really think something is finally gonna come to a head of hiding still say that and like with T.C it's almost always T.C and they're open up the door and at the same time Julian and the Eve are hiding in the back didn't know where to be found and you think that he's gonna see them together and he says oh my god no and then we go to commercial let me come back and it has nothing to do with that oh that car that beat up old curl I wish I had that thing it's worth a lot of cash I know they do that all the time it's a show that's designed to aggravate and we love it it's just hysterical alright it's the best um I have a

Which ones are on the left side? Which one is the right side? Which one is the right side? Which one's the right side? Which one's the right side? I admire the gig. What gig guys? Well, it's a gig. It's a gig. How many of them? They see Charles Darwin as their savior. And I think if you talk to religious fanatics, the people that don't leave Charles Darwin think that he's theory of evolution. So I realized that evolution was a gaiting. No, I never did that. I mean, I've never noticed that the gig I always say have the little sticker on their cars as Darwin. No. No. I never stopped to ask the drivers if they were gay or not. Okay. How do you know that? Because they had the Darwin. But how do you know if the drivers are gay? I don't know because they're gay. Oh, well, stop it. Now check it out for us. Do some research. He's looking. Look at the pink hair.

Because in the polo, Neil book, he writes about John O'Neill. And certainly in the Richard Clark book, he's got many references to John O'Neill. Who was a good friend of his? And a great, I mean, a really bright guy. And very courageous guy. Unfortunately, he was a, he was his first day on the job. First week on a job.

Yet we owe it to ourselves and our families to be sure we're in good health. Or at least as best we can. It's a true impact the disease responds extremely well. The treatment if we catch it early.

You know what I'm talking about? What do you talk about? Piece of mind. You're thinking about pieces of something else. Piece of mind man. Go through that thing. You just like an MRI.

Oh, I suppose to like have a conversation or say something. I'm curious. I'm using something. I see. Well, do you use your catch on fast? No. What's going on for 20 years? How many years did it take me? About 30 minutes. Yeah. Oh, no. I forgot the big OS still out there until two. We still got almost another hour. They're about to see the big. Oh. She killed W's to be the big eight. Marm. You see, she can't W. But we got the big curr Q. I am. Quite frankly, I'd rather have the big eight. But that's okay because he's a good guy. Horrible on the ear. He'll be there until two o'clock. What? Why do you laugh when I say that? You don't listen to the sports segments on a station? No. So I'll take a word for. In fact, he was so ecstatic when a crow came back on the ear because he said, Oh, God. At least finally, somebody made me look a little bit better. I don't count your pigeons too fast as the crow flies. Anyway, the big OS would be until two at McDonald's. 32, 47 Hollywood Boulevard stopped by the wind some of our very cheesy prizes and some tickets for upcoming Marlin' Home Games. It's rockery.

You just can't. I mean, everything you say, oh, did I mean, did I do something wrong there? There it was, you know?

I'm sorry I apologize for a waiting so long. Wait in your this story this one will set you off the edge. I already told you this but it's a sickening New York Post this morning A callous traffic agent ignored the pleas of a double parked Brooklyn driver suffering a fatal heart attack and wrote him $150 summons telling witnesses as she walked off just tell him to pay his ticket the victim's family charged last night He was having a heart attack Stokesk you just tell him to pay the King ticket okay The stunning claim came as the outrage relatives of honor free of inti a Bensonhurst Taylor Filed a $100 million loss to the against the female traffic enforcement agent her coworker and the city Were very hurt.

She had a burrow some from rush The tragedy occurred just afternoon this past Saturday as a vintage 61 waited for his wife Carmelah who was shopping at the Met Supermarket on 20th ab between 70 second and 73rd streets in New York That's when the family says a traffic agent identified as L Hinkson walked up and without a word Started writing a vente at ticket for double parking He was angry about it. He started a feel sick and you'll play that he wasn't feeling well He told the agent she should call for an ambulance at a bond these hearts six on veto 32 veto�eoni the witness is said she just walked away and told them just Tom the pay is ticket What a bitch? Is that incredible or what a very credible The ticket was written at 12 or 7 p.m. and some of the finally called 9 11 and 12 16 when it was two late family members said They claimed that if the traffic agent had called for help immediately a vente might as survived which needless to say he did not that he survived. No No This was an outright disregard for human lives had family attorneys Sanford Rubenstein Rubenstein But deputy police commissioner Paul Brown said there was no evidence the agents were aware of obvious Condition and the witnesses have disputed the family's version of events A law enforcement source told the post-apulmonary proverbial someone as this had lied and made him bellow statements One of me even said the storm would yell at me The source added that event he had refused to take the ticket and suddenly attack after hints in no drove away This was a cranky old man with made your health problems the source said I think the message is if you have a bad heart Part legally oh Man if you have a bad heart Part legally don't break the law and you won't be dying over there It sounds like they're all hard to me that the police Department well he won't do that again.

You can't vote this year. We just decided. But. In fact, I'm election day. We're going to clean you up. We're going to give you a shower. Which of these people have fin you the most we asked? Religious fanatics 459. 54.2 percent of this crowd are sick and tired of your crap. Okay. I think you want to believe the rest of us are young. We want to be left alone, like Marlene and D.T. We're a red agarber. Where were we said that? In addition, we've seen every set. See, it's kind of pointless figuring out who was it. Was it May West? I want to be alone. I think it was great agarber. But she never said it. She never said it. And Jimmy Cacken, he never said you dirty rat. Yeah. And, uh, Kary Grant never said, dude, they did. They did. Maybe, maybe he did. I don't know. They said. I don't know. He never heard it. Uh, religious fanatics 462. He was a 166. He was good actor, Kary Grant. He was also well. I want to say it. Uh, old. Old. Old. 36. Old. Old. 34. cigarettes. 26. Uh, was it, uh, Danny K. Rames with. Faye. Let's see. L'Ebell's 26. Reds. Old. 26. Blacks. Why three Haitian drivers. 15. We're not too keen on a Haitian drive in here. This kind of nicely there. Uh, what did I say? Blacks. Uh, the homeless voice 13. Illegal aliens 12. This thing with a mouse man. We got a mouse problem. Yeah. Well. Oh, you know what it is? A snagged? Yeah. Snagged. It's like a snagged. There he go. Much snagged. You old fish and line man. It's bad. My, uh, mouse was in deep trouble. The homeless voice 13. Illegal aliens 12. Atheist date. Golf Panatic 6. White people. Five. Can't stand them. Sports nerds. Five. Fags for. Bugadones. Fitness. Not three. Trailer trash three. Jamaica. It's two and computer nerds. One out of eight. Fifty. We're moving right along here. I mean, it's, you know, it's the beginning of the end for this town for another year. I just, as long as I've been here, it's just, I've never been able to figure this out. How can anybody called this like a real place? A world class city. How can you do that? When it, when it's still just a horse and buggy fly by night place. When it's soon as Easter and pace all her overmen, everybody in their brother just can't, they can't get out of here soon enough. Amen. They just can't get out soon enough. What's your point? There's something wrong here, man. There's something that don't meet the eye. Something really, uh, stinks. The pothinco doesn't meet the pink eye. Oh, by the way, he said it's a pick and up a little bit. What? He said he picked up a little bit. This is probably a Westland. Here's the fact that said, and this is a pretty good idea, and what we can do it. Let's put the look through the holes. Uncle, he was saying, glory how will you when he was looking? Uncle Neil and reference, didn't he? Don't start. He was again, getting start. Now you're with his field for conversion and trying to get a sound effect. In reference to Neil's noises, are you going to update that part of the website? I need to assume that, but all your CDs throughout the years, but it's good. More fun to have that all available on your website. Considering it's your website and not the radio stations, why can't you put out the so-called band stuff? Because we'd rather put it on CD and sell it for charity this year. Right. Right. He was in for free, of course. We can put out a double set. Right. And still, as opposed to spending hours uploading and uploading, which it took hours. And that makes it all the space to take on the website. And all the band would be required to all the band down, all that stuff that you would have to pay for. Because Eric never had to do that. How much I offered to pay for that, so he doesn't respond because he likes being like my mother a professional victim. He enjoys martyrdom. I appreciate him very much. You're the best. But he just enjoy, I keep offering. What can I do? How much is it? Let me know. You know, send him a check, a bad one, a good one, whatever. He will not take it. So back to these guys that won something for free. Yes. Oh, you hear that? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. That was a Raspberry. I'm sorry. Just give you a Raspberry. And some other sort of fruit. 5.670560. Don't forget the big girl. He's almost done out there anyway. He's just a nice and nice. Nice and stuff. All in burgers. I don't care what you say. You know what is what? I will agree. I will agree with you. Be honest. Shadow of a doubt. That McDonald's his head's in shoulders above Burger King. We've done it. How many times have we done that? Not bird man. Burger King is the absolute worst thing is what did he worst. It is just when you have a piece of rubber in fact. The flat Terry that Jeff had out here before. I understand they already shifted off the Burger King. for tomorrow's lunch. Robert, well they won't serve it for any of you. And it's cooked through a conveyor belt, right? I'm never crazy about things that are cooked in a conveyor belt. Just like Pizza Hut makes their pizzas in a conveyor belt. None of that would be a problem if they actually serve it to you when it comes off of the conveyor belt. No, I disagree. I disagree. It's rubbery. Yeah. Tasteless. The oven rings are an insult. In fact, I think maybe the onion world, if there were such a thing now, to sue have a class act in the onion industry, worst excuse for an onion ring ever is a burger king. So I would agree with you. I'm going to McDonald's is far at least it's edible, right? When I'm an Amsterdam, I want to stack their late at night. And I just do nothing. I mean, the restaurant's there are just horrendous. I mean, 95% of them just below the restaurant. And so at any rate, I'll go to McDonald's, right? Get a couple of double cheese burgers. Take them back to my hotel room. Throw away the buns. Right. I'll sit right there. And you're most of us are the well-funded aerodite that you are. What does that mean? That we are sloppers. And so we drew go to drive through. Let me ask you something. What about Wendy's? Wendy's is there? Wendy's is got juicy juicy. Look what happened to poor Dave. What's his name there from Wendy's? It was like Dave Thomas. Right. There's about 10 McDonald's for every Wendy's. You can't always find one. Come on. Cracker, please, man. Who are you? I've got to Wendy's. It's closer than anything. So, I've got to go right out there by the store. We have a probably haven't dinner night. We've ponded old Ron. But Dave always available. We'll be breaking the potatoes together. And McDonald's fries are better than Wendy's. I don't eat fries. I know. But the rest of the stew. Now, how come Wendy's never had onion rings? I don't know. They got paid. And if McDonald's don't have onion rings either. No, they don't. Just one of those things. Okay. Burger King, dying. Anyway, I've not doing McDonald's. Not when I'm here. I mean, if I couldn't find it because you got a woman. I will say this. People say I'm anti-American. It's not. I'm just anti-bouch. Anti-discoverman. But the food. Now, if you want to tie in food, certainly it is the best to tie in food. But all kinds of food, the variety. There's no place like this country. Anywhere that I've ever been. Right? Seriously, make sense. Right. We've got somebody from everywhere. Food in a lot of countries in Europe. Other than Netherlands. There's good food in Germany. There's excellent fabulous Italian food in Rome. But you want a great steak? You're not going to give it an Italy. We've got the best variety. Yeah. The restaurants here are pretty damn good. 19 till 2 at 5. 16 WQM have been putting off that home improvement dream because you're terrified that you're going to have a home improvement nightmare instead.

Well, I got to do the break a little bit earlier than usual because we got some fantastic music to take us. We ought to play that baseball thing. Get out of what's that, what's the name of that thing? The disc played by playing the radio? Play by playing the radio. Play by playing the radio. I don't have any sub-rate. I'll fight it during the next break or not. In fact, I'll fight it right now. Trying to organize that thing in there. Look at the number two column. Oh, great news. Look at that. Very good. Now, I think it's on this one. Play by playing on the radio. I guess I'm pretty sure it's on this one. No, I think it's on this one. What's on one of these, isn't it? It's on one of them. That's the first baseball game. It's a beautiful day for a ball game. It's got to be on one of these. Oh, please don't tell me correctly. There's only you and it's on one. There it is.

Play by play. I saw it on a radio. That'd be great. It's not that you can send the Marlon game. Because it's the only way. It's the only way. It's the only way they're going to see it on the radio. That's right. You'll see it right here on QM. Just look into your speaker. Use your imagination. The day van boring is actually animated.
