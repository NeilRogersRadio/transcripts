Pryder, you fass dude. This holiday season, the spirit of peace honor, and good world's forgemen, is a lie. The side by channel proudly presents, O Whitney Houston, crackhouse Christmas. Crack is rat. Life from a burnt house, a laffeted storefront, and the alley behind Friellenheisen Avenue, a Newark New Jersey. It's a Whitney Houston crackhouse Christmas. Crack is rat. With special guests, he has me in belief. Life Garrett, Nick Nulti, and Marion Berry. Toad the night before Christmas, I've been popped in my car, snoring some coke and drinking him from a young. It's a Whitney Houston crackhouse Christmas, with a surprise appearance by the Newark Undercovered our Cottage Division, and Whitney's bipolar husband, Bobby Brown. Nick crack this cheese. Brought to you without commercial an eruption, by Jamal and Tahir, who supplied them a Carter highway hood. Crack is rat. It's a Whitney Houston crackhouse Christmas. What are we disturbed or what? Anyway, it's 1553 and 560, WDQ, I'm happy how light is from our dear good friends, and from us too, at QAAM. What? I think since it's the holidays, and we're out of ratings now for like about three weeks, whatever it is. What? I'm here in Tiga to 90's here. What do you think? Maybe you want to know what I'll drop in. No, but he's done that before. Anyway, I want to move you last night. I realized I got a bunch of DVDs sitting around here based on recommendations of listeners, and I haven't gotten around to watch an column. Like Cottie, for example. Last week I watched Cottie. It was pretty good. Did you see Gotie? No. It was good. Not great, but good. Last night I watched the movie, and I would say for the first time in my life, I watched the whole thing. It's a highly old man. Recommendations of the Ying Ying. 1997 Academy Award nominee, best film of the year, since the LA Times, New York Times, New York Post, New Day, etc. And I watched it. I don't know if I liked it or not. I still don't know, though. Maybe you got to watch it again. The sweet here after. You see it? No. No. So story about a attorney in a small town in British Columbia, no less. And he descends upon a small town where they've had this horrible school bus accident. And a whole bunch of little kids got in Killed. And he's going from Fang's to the city. He's going to the city. He's going from family to family. And promising how he's been like Su, somebody. He's going to follow his big lawsuit, class action suit. And they're going to get lots of money for all these families. And come to find out that the lawyer himself, his whole life is all screwed up. He's got a daughter who's like our crack. She's like Whitney Houston. And it's not any watch it. And it gets to a certain point. I'm not going to run the ending for anybody who didn't see it. Maybe there's somebody out there to sort of into saw it. There's got to be because I think one of you recommended to me. Damn it. It was okay. The acting was very good. But it just, I don't know. It's just less you kind of like limp. You know what I mean? No. You watch the whole thing and you get chew it and like, yeah. And so what's the point? And then it kind of like ends very abruptly. Like, oh gee, well, that wasn't supposed to happen. And oh, well, let's see into that. Maybe you missed something. I was like, no, no, I didn't miss anything. I mean, I missed what they're trying to say there. But I'm not saying anything. And it's got these tremendous recommendations. Like, this is just for, of course, it's directed by Adam, the guy I'm, I mean, the guy who's legendary in his own mind. Maybe somebody after saw it. Tell me to cue in. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. I know the sweet here after. And it was cool in the bus when I was in the ice. But everything after that, you're right. The ending kind of just kind of went off. And it was. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what, what? So what does it all mean? It didn't, it didn't. It didn't. It didn't. It didn't. But what the hell was the point by the time he got down. I mean, so they were all the families were screwed up just like he would deploy or was screwed up with his daughter. And everybody was unhappy. Was it morbid and depressing, I think? Yeah. Everybody ate toys, sir. Yeah, that's true. To be able to go to the ice. Thanks a lot. See you, too. See there's somebody seen in it. What are we doing? One break, I guess, because we're doing more than one. It'd be kind of tough to do it. Maybe it was in squeeze and like in the four minutes. Maybe we can like accelerate the speed and the spots like Cheek channel was doing with the music. Remember that? Remember that we're like, speeding up the spots. Or that could squeeze more commercials in like less time. Were they? Yeah. I'm pretty sure that was cheap channel, or some of, bunch of grave robbing radio bastards. It sure was nussman. We're in fact we're going to play the spots real slow. We have the highest church show. Meal Rogers mornings in midday. And we're so round and wide. To fly us into the street we can. This is the Neal Rogers show. This is the Neal Rogers show. This is the Neal Rogers show. Any questions? Fish near. Rain in the holiday season. With a voice that rains as clear as a jingle bell. It's a macy gray Christmas. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good evening award winning vocalist, Macy Gray. Singed in a style that's beyond compare. At a language that's beyond comprehension. Yeah. You're making me a macy gray Christmas. Macy sings all her eulty favorites like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On a macy gray Christmas. Macy sings all her eulty favorites like. Hi there. In your head. Right here. And this in this hyperbucy sick. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're a macy gray Christmas. I'm macy gray Christmas. Macy gray Christmas is available at your local gang. Yeah. I love it. Oh, two or five, 60 WC. I think we'll play a lot of stuff today, right? Yeah. We got my girl there because the beast is over screwing his brains out in clear water, wherever it is with his lovely girlfriends. So at the very witsy, merrily sounding at a point that out. Very witsy, posh resort. Yeah. Yeah. When you've had a rich mommy and daddy, we're paying for your apartment on brickle and paying for your like weekends over their clear water. Sure. It can be very witsy. Talk about a spoiled brat. But you did a pretty good job this week. We go. Okay. You're friend. And I'm just telling you, which is about the first time I would ever say. I mean, that's not such a great compliment because in the past, he's been an embarrassment on his show. Anytime he's ever filled in on here. He never says anything, but this week he was like a little more verbose. Maybe because he was getting whipped up about this weekend. So I think we'll play a lot of stuff because the one thing we got came handles when I start re-knowing bedtime stories, he gets really crotchety and crotchety and crotchety and he only bob crotch it. This Christmas. Here's the poll result from yesterday. They hated this poll. I think that's the lowest number of hosts we've had on a poll in Cooldzay, GPS me. They hated it. Who has the best public restrooms? I thought it was, I mean, the list is suggested it. 899 hosts. The rich Carlton 206 must be a lot of you folks like, uh, spent a lot of time in there. Huh? I can't imagine even the 266 people in this audience have ever done any business at the rich Carlton. But nevertheless, that's what you tell us. The cheesecake factory 118. Built more hotel one 13. Hard rock casino 94. I'd like to do some business in the restroom at the Hard Rock casino. And leave my signature like on the walls and the ceilings. You know what I mean? No. Shweered around a little bit. Ruth Chris stay cow 69. Barnes and Noble 66. Houston's 59. I love Houston's what are fine establishment. I don't know about their. I don't think I ever did any business of Houston's, but man, if food is good. Why is it that there are places that we know are really good, but you just never get around to go in there. You know what I mean? Don't have time. Well, Houston's always crowded too. Now, I am Houston's day head that little buzzer thing you stick in your pocket and you have to be very careful what you put a real close to. That dumb. Yeah. They still do that. What you're waiting for, you know, you give me your name. You got a little peeper and you got like a little peeper and then buzzes. It is you're in your hand or fish stick in your pocket. Or we're like right up against your private's. And then all of a sudden starts like vibrating. But anyway, Houston's 59's very good. David buss is 46. Westland Mall 43. This is the crowd that hangs out in Miss the limbo rocket to JC plays in Burtine's and Westland. I know you play. Yeah. Wasteland is right. The first thing I saw us 39 up. The only reason that was on there is the person who suggested this pool. The fancier said that toys are us with their choice. And 39 votes. So they might know something. We don't. Embassy, sweet 38 and Spring Hill, sweet, it's only eight. Because the most people never heard of that. The truckers know where it is though. Right. The truckers are hanging out with those trucks. That's okay. Yeah. Well, listen, you know, gag is slowly out there to road all those hours. Look for the QA in Van today from 1130 to 1330 to 1130 to 1130 to 11. It's the Edwin Watts golf place at 12.011. 12,000 and one Westland rise full of our words at Westland rise and one. Flamingo. You're asking me, you're the old guy. You're the old guy. You're the Rotis. Crap. East of Flamingo. Stop by the win prizes and enjoy free food from Atlantic City subs where our are used to make the difference and it plays is great. Am I right? I was not there anymore. No, Jason makes a difference now. Jason makes a difference. It's their food is good. Those fat fill sandwiches. Join QAM tomorrow from noon till 3. It took at a creed Mitsubishi located at 4930, 4950. North state road 7. Stop by for prizes and food again from Atlantic City subs where Jason makes a difference. I was supposed to the other sub place where Jared makes a difference and we hate your. Oh, God, what a nerd. Aren't you tired of him already? Yeah, he's the worst. By the way, he said we're here to talk about subs. We'd use him to board a ride. Give me a break. And then they play. He's got the wedding band on. They claim he got married. He goes really to me. Looks like a flamer. Also from noon to 2, a little George who sounds like one, but isn't it doesn't look like one. But he sounds like a flamer on here. George noted to be at Bill Sibles Mitsubishi and Bill Sibles Boulevard on say of savings. Northwest 36, which is west of 27th Avenue, Miami Hill have prizes and food from guess what? Atlantic City subs. Where Jason makes a difference. Okay, our beat is curtain today and we apologize for this. But look, I'm not going to lie to you. It's the holidays now from here on in till the until January 2. It's like just mishmash, you know. We're just going some time. More so than usual. I mean, I got to pretend we're going to do some fantastic radio today. We're going to, we're like, even on our website. We're just going to the, we're just a spackle more so than usual. Josie Moran, we just had a run here like a week or two ago. But for our Josh there, he's sitting there with the left over. He's from whatever George left him on there. Pretty much. So when George comes back next week, he better have to it on that beat curtain because people are going to start saying, I'm not that bitch again. Josie Moran, born May 8th, 1970, in Central Park, California. There's movies there. It's about all I can say. And actually, I forgot. But if you, we still have the Jessica Simpson photo on her. She's got like a new pan and out. Yeah. So that's there too, a little bonus for you. Born and raised in Northern California, Josie Moran. She was in the aviator, little black book, fan-housing, swatters, the maloeuvra effect, and of course, like everybody else who's got movies on the Howard Stern show. There you go. Now today's poll question. I should play butterfly kisses, not her that movie to sweet her after fits in perfect for the daughter. Yeah, because she kept calling him on his cell phone. She kept calling him. Yeah. Who's your choice for 2004 person to hear? If time magazine can do it, our group audience can do it. Who's your choice now? We've only got four on there right now, which I know this didn't put peristilton on her. Because nobody told you. Well, I'm not a pera right now. Put her on. That was Miguel Suggestion. I got George W. Bush and I say that with great shame in him, the Asian and degradation in the sorrow and despair. Michael Moore, who got my vote. Because that's bad folks. I got a stick together. Howard Dean, who kind of like revitalized the Democratic Party until John Kerry killed with again, and then the Periscillton, which I don't know what your rationale is for that. She's not. Not how I'm looking. Not how acting not how any of it. She's a big. Because I mean, the sign is true. Because she's got a lot of money. She's got the big bucks. For us, I'm concerned. She ain't got nothing. What is it that she's got beside the money? Anything? She's got celebrity. Yeah, but what is she got to make sure celebrity? You have to have like some ingredient. It's that she's a celebrity. A lot of media high. Oh, there's Periscillton said this and our ugly sister also said that. Nobody cared. Well, the problem is people don't care. Just like Amber Fry is writing the book. I was thinking of myself, what kind of person other than these shut-in fat housewives and trailer trash? Who's going to be reading about Amber Fry? Would anybody really care about Scott Peterson and Amber Fry? In fact, let's get it over with already. Just fry his ads. And that's the end of it. Of course, the taxpayers in California are going to be paying millions to keep his ugly ass alive for a very long time. Just fry him right now. I don't know they don't do that anymore, but let's make another session. Put it right there on like a barbell while there's special on ABC. Paperview. Right. Paperview. I paid a watch. But I paid a watch. How much would you pay? I'm 30 minutes. Watch Scott Peterson get off. That'll work. 30 bucks. Sure. Better watch another one. Lay mass fixed Tyson fights. How many QA and hello? Now see, that's not a good way to start. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, Neil. You're going to pick me up cold like that. Take care. That's the way we do. We pick everybody up cold. Okay. Speaking of cold, it ain't too good down here today. It's cozy here. It's like minus six Celsius, but it's sunny. Anyways, not raining like there. I ran into an old friend of mine this morning. He's a flight attendant for a major airline. And him and I had a long conversation. And somehow religion came up. And I asked for a. I asked what religion he was. And he said, Catholic. Yeah. So I turned around and I said, hey father. If they say you can't, I don't turn around. That's not a good idea. Anyway, I said father, can you help an old doctor boy? Yeah. And he says all that sounds familiar. What movie that from? I said, I'll give you another clue. Father, can you help an old old boy? I said the power. The power. The power. The power. He's so proud of you. Yeah. That's what I said next. He goes, he all the exercises. He says you're not going to believe this. He said on his flight last night. In first class, he had Linda Blair sitting in first class. Isn't that sweet? So hold hold. So I asked him. I said, what does she look like? Sally? Scruggers? You know, because I'm thick and she's fat and heavy. Right. Rose looking. He said, she's absolutely gorgeous. Yeah. Beautiful, beautiful, polite, nice, beautiful. Just like Reagan. Yeah. Exactly. And Captain Howdy. But isn't that kind of freaky? Yeah. That is freaky. I'm sure you're there from listening to the show. You've got this. My psychic powers are transferring to you. There you go. Have a happy power. Okay. See all the people out there put your hands on the radio. My psychic powers will transfer to you. Maybe I like you when the lot of you get the numbers. You know, pop it in your head. Yeah. I thought I worked it. Or maybe you'll meet some big celebrity on a plane or somebody who met a big celebrity like an AK. Right? Maybe you'll meet somebody who was in the sweep here after. I don't know. There were no big name actor type people. And I'm a real see who was in it. It was with Ian Holmes. No. Yeah. That's it. Ian Holmes. No, right. You're not the Ethan Hawke or chicken hog. But I don't know. Ian Holmes. He was good. He played the lawyer. He was the main character in the movie. But it's just, I don't know. It was just like an hour and 52 minutes of depression. That's all. It was very depressing. And it was a typical trailer trash. A little town. And I went to everybody was doing the one guy who was doing his daughter. And everybody would do the other guy who was meeting this bitch in a hotel and the hotel and doing her. And so there are a bunch of trailer trash. Well, is that a surprise? You didn't British Columbia or any other little town in North America. I would think not. Now, it no big names. This movie was up for movie. Oh, this movie. You're looking at this and it just you think this movie is just phenomenal. I think that's why I think I hated it. No, but because you see, I'm a, which I really allow that to happen. I don't let myself get influenced by the lack of the vanilla ice cream or McDonald's. I know what I like. And I like it. I don't care whether anybody else likes it or not. If I like it, that's good enough for me. But just a jacket on this DVD thing, 1997 Academy Award nominee Best Director, Best in Epid Screenplay. And then they got all these guys who, these critics who said Best Film of the Year. Well, 97 must have been a really weak year for movies. If that was the best film of the year. I just want to know those artsy parks. Don't crap. No, it wasn't so much artsy parks either. There were some breathtaking photography in here like on the mountains. You don't British Columbia and the snow. And of course on my new set. It looked fabulous. It looked really, really great. But, huh? Well, that was about the highlight. That was the best thing I could say for it is that the snow and the mountains and the sun looked really great on HD. But other than that, forget about it. When you read all that crap, you get high expectations. That's right. And I'm sitting there waiting okay. Well, something really great is going to happen. But it never did. Thank you, baby. Yo, son, dragon after a tough day, ramen over fat piece. The you need to chill in a J.C. poor little planet. The only chance is that by me, multi-plat in the recording artist J.C. Check this bad boy out. The guy who's been tripping the J.C. poor little planet got 24k gold cap holders and armrests. Big enough to hold 8 magnets of crystal young and they see this extra wire. Just in case you're sure to be on stage, that's fine. You're all saying. Such as you what you're done and they're boy. What a big. And here's the best part. The J.C. poor little planet are just a poor position young. Business, business, relax and a mad pimp. And take this. The bad J.C. poor, put with these poor best. It's perfect. We're putting our Kelly Day. He'll off your stage. Yo, what the? Yo, what the? J.C. poor little planet is just a poor little yoke trip today. 1118 at 5.16. WDQAM. 59 votes are on a poll. Who do you think is the person of the year for 2004? Michael Moore 31 Howard Dean 11. George's WD has got 11 and the person who got six. That's the only names we've got on there yet. But we'll get a bunch more. But first couple of taxes here. New levels are right wing censorship. This one says from a real chronic. Last night I was in an AOL chat room arguing politics with LUNI right wingers. My question of that is. Yeah. Arguing politics with LUNI right wingers. Really productive. Thought that you saw your time. And one point I asked is question why is it when a soldier comes back from Iraq and systems aren't going very well there. He gets labeled a liberal comedy fag. Some right winger reported me to AOL and they shut down my account. I had to call this morning have it reinstated. The moral of the story is if you have an opposing view that will shut you down. While we know that. That's the only correct. By the way, freedom is on the march. Evolution is only a theory in the world of flat. It's only matter of time before they start burning which is this weekend I think. It's Salem. Is what they're going to be doing. There's another fact from Jay who says Barack Obama for the poll. That's an excellent choice. You got it on there yet? Yeah. But I will. Any second. I hope to see you here more. Him in the future. I say Barack for a person in 2008. He'll be great. Also, I love the show. Now, see this is like a little. Here it is. It's the 17th of December. You know what? Anniversary. This is today just dawned on me. No. Let's see. 28 years ago. December 17, 1976. WKAT. I came out of the closet on the ear and said, hey. Yeah. How do you like that? That's a little energy. I mean, it's no Pearl Harbor Day. But it's just something. I'm a home home. Right. Also, it says I love the show. But I'm looking forward to the second. He even said it's in the George show for a little change. Well, a good news for you, Jay is that starting next Thursday, George will be on all the way through the end of the year. I'm a vacation. So there you go. It's coming. Excellent. It's like a little dig. Love to show. But you're getting a little pond of a sin to old and the like our cats. So we want George back on. George will be back Monday, by the way. Because he's just, when you stop, yes, suspended a sentence. Okay. Just cut the crap. Suicide and scatedral standoff at the Crystal Cathedral. Oh, no. A standoff between police and a church employee who opened fire with a handgun at the Crystal Cathedral. And the early today when the man shooting and killing himself. No one was hurt when the man initially began shooting yesterday. And children and they care, say, we're rushed to safety. The man stayed inside the complex for several hours. And shot himself as often as he tried to talk to my, he hold up in a bathroom. I bet it was a messy bathroom too. Probably Reverend Schuwis felt that they would have been clean in the tea rooms. There's got probably wouldn't get like all claustrophobic and maybe he just got maybe distanced just got to him after a while. You think Louis brains out. There was a dialogue. And then the officers heard the gunshot. Garden group. It kind of like what's his name Andrew Clinton and remember that? Oh yeah. Yeah, they heard a gunshot. Then then I'll never forget they went inside the houseboat and there's nobody in there. Well, let's go back. There's a lot of smoke and stuff and let's go back again because we put all the tear in. Oh, there he is. That was great. What outstanding police work man. That was the best. Okay, let's get some of the names for the full and quit screwing around. Also, we'll play like a whole bunch of stuff today. I think I should play butterfly kisses and other that awful movie. Great bit. Thank you. Hello. Oh, no. Okay. Reverend Jones. Come to cue. You guys are driving me crazy. Yeah. What do you want to do? With the sweet you're after it's a great movie. Oh, yeah. Now see, you're because you're stoned off your ass all the time. You're the kind of guy. This is under one of those movies. He did acid first. You probably would enjoy it. What was so good about it? It sounded like they were out to hide it. So one thing that they stood out best selling books and most of the great movies. So what it's based on. See, I'm not impressed by that. I saw it. In other words, it's like saying, oh, this is a 16 star rated restaurant. If I go in there and have a crappy meal, I don't care how many stars anybody gave it. Even the full was the star and David. I don't care. If it's not. You think like the. You could have stopped the question. I didn't like think. I don't think I'm going to get paid to think. That the trailer trash people you were talking about. That was the whole thing of the movie was. These people were a lot in their little live screw and around on each other. Yeah. So is that like a bulletin? Is that like a big deal? No, but they had all these more of the secrets and when that accident happened, all of a sudden, they were like trying to cover up or they were trying to get them to make money. And he was like trying to get refrained. Well, I mean, first of all, the guy I was banging the chicken, the motel room. He wasn't covering anything up. No, but they had like this secret affair that was going on in the. Yeah. The whole world exploded when this box was. I think I've never saw Peyton place. I mean, how many years ago was that? She's. That's a lot. I don't know. You must be. You must say it's found a good stuff. She said that you said that you thought the ending we saw that. But didn't you think that was a great twist that the girl that was being a. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't say it. Don't say it because then nobody will watch it. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You want to do it. You want to move in for some of you. You're not going to watch it anyway. Okay. So in other words, the girl said she lied and she says she's rather this pedometer. And she said, I was the right thing. I will say this. The very end when he got on. He went to the airport. Yeah. And he gets shot and he's given the. Can't were limber whatever. And he looks in there driving the bus at the airport. Is the bus driver to woman who is the bus driver. And here that thing off the road and the frozen lake. And she was like, but the little kids take them to a museum or something. Right. Right. That part was good. But that lasted like 30 seconds. Yeah, but I just thought I'd seen it like three or four times. Oh, I just moved. Oh, come. Oh, come. Prida, man. You must have fallen in hard times. But that do me a favor whenever you want to move you on your fantastic system. Smoking a little pot. And it will open your mind a little bit to see. Because it will nuance. And the right. And you said you have to be stunned to enjoy this. You probably also like video drone. So come and see my play. Why? Down into the bit. One hotel. We're doing our job. Why is it like my great team room is in thevilleville hotel. And in fact, what about from previous play? It'll make you. That's the irony of the dog doing plays there. They're always like these raw, violent plays in this beautiful little hotel. And the coral gay holes. It had beautiful arrest rooms. So anyway, why do you want to play a plug or not? What is that? I see do you want to plug your play? Sure. It's the same guy who built killer Joe, which was a huge shit about five years ago. When I was back in town. Yeah. I was a big kid. And Tracy left. Talk about trailer trash. He's plays about these trailers trash characters that always try to do the wrong thing. And if it's a great team surviving, there's new to be this violence. There's blood. And it's a great twisty. But actually you would love to because it's about terror and oil and the government taking over the country. Sounds good to me. What these trailers trash people that live in a public city? So much drama trash and so little time. But it was written during the level of the city bombings. But it's funny because it really resonates now with W. So if you get a chance come see it. And it's runnin through new years. Oh, well, well, you can maybe I'll come and see if I sure doubt it. Well, I'm happy you're hollowing. What's up a little? I have to have to say that by the way. You know, he also has past this. He'll be over to see you. Where? Yeah, probably said. Well hang out after the plays over and we'll go get a drink. Yeah, go smoke. Yeah, go smoke. I want one. Okay. Say goodbye captain Dave. Get the same naked. So like I said, Oh, I'm doing the whole day. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, what a thought. Here's one. It says, even though I hate him like poison. You have to put the Donald on list. Let's put Donald Trump on there. Just put those people away. Because he's on television again now. And because everybody's watching that show and you fired it. And you fired it and the if I, you know, stuff like that. Don't you know, you're fired it. Donald Trump. It'd be a lot of marginal people. Let's put some trailer trash on. Let's put some trailer trash on. Let's put some trailer trash on. It's a lot of shit. Give me a copy. Yeah. It's a lot of shit. There's two things on it. Daddy, you're loser. He said he's from heaven, and she said he's a little girl. I would let go in my pants. I got a lot of junk. I got a lot of junk. Yeah. I've got a lot of junk. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I think Mommy cheated on you. I think Mommy cheated on you. What's up? I think we're time for a little more fun. All in forever. Why is a man on his hair? I'm so lonely. I'm so dumb and something wrong. Daddy why don't you get a job? To deserve a home, give it all. And what if my kisses and now? Daddy can all be here. Sweetest things to do.

Roberts who served seven months in a doctor in the US and Dayton in 2003, we do to report back to Fort Stewart Georgia on Wednesday, police said he is a supply specialist with the Army's third infantry division. According to commanders at Fort Stewart, they said Roberts has been in the armistice in 2001. Was on a two week call. They leave it as home and call it off. And a friend should have been lagging. He's still going back. I think he was there long enough. Yes, may not you. They don't want to go. They do not want to go. And what are they going for? Does anybody know? No, no. They signed up. Murdoch's $44 million New York pad. $44 million. The anxious, the obnoxious, the right wing, the HIPAA group report Murdoch, who dazzles you with TNA on Fox Entertainment Channel while be giling in the distressing the rights of us with his right wing, paranoid crap on Fox News Channel. Rupert Murdoch, chairman and CEO of the media giant news corpus, agreed to violate Lawrence Rockefeller's fifth afternoon penthouse apartment for $44 million. The published report said today. Poor baby. I'm not impressed. We're pretty Murdoch. I mean, I know he isn't care coming first and I'm just telling him. I don't really care to me. He's a piece of turd. New York Times said the billionaire media mogul will pay the asking price for the three-story apartment in a lavish co-auth at 834-50 Avenue. The price tag would be the highest price ever paid for Manhattan Department of the deal goes through the paper. Said setting a person is familiar with the deal. The offer is accepted Monday. The representative of the state was responsible for the sale court of the times. And what's the contract to sign by Murdoch? He and his family must also be approved by the co-auth board of the building. Oh, you're rejected. Okay. We don't bring in trash like you, Rupert, and you're a crazy family. Okay. You're out. They must be approved by the condo board. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I'm still in shock hearing from Capriet. I don't know which has got me like a little more off my feed. Watch the neck moving. Then for him. See, it doesn't surprise me that he would tell us that he liked that movie. Oh, he's watching three or four times. Yeah, he's watching 20 or 30 times. Stone off his ass. Crawl on on the floor, reaching for his life. The sweet character in Adam Aguyem film with Ian Holmes. I didn't like it. And only now, only all these hours after I watched it, I'm finally admitting to myself that it was pretty weak. WQA and hello. QAM. Um, thing in the ring. Um, thing in the ring. WQA and hello. I'm going to go with you. Yes, sir. Um, for the Paul, Dave, why don't you start? Yeah, I'm alright. Alright. Okay, there you go. Dave wants to put him on there. Let's have a few comedy people on there. What do you say? All right. He's a funny guy. Don't miss that. I'm just thinking of myself. Maybe that guy's trying to say, I'm not. Stand. Yeah. Think about it. Stand. Here's the facts from Joe who says, I don't get a chance to call him very often. Probably a good idea, Joe. But I want to comment on a few things discussed on your show this week. First of all, we'll afford to spot machines in our longer solar casinos. The manufacturer is realized how popular the machines have become in an essence. Leases them to casinos, wishing to obtain them. Any casinos wishing to obtain these machines and I must pay the manufacturer if 3% of the profits forever. Wow. So in other words, that's more proof that those of us who now Miguel plays slot machines in the casino. I have. I don't go. No, I'm not. Now see right off the back defensive. You see that? No. You've been there a new play. I'm in the sound like you're afraid that people are going to think you're like, something like that because you play slot machines. You've seen a young people old people, men, women, everybody plays. You know, give them a shot, right? Right. And you're buddy across the glass there. Josh is just terrified to play. You're afraid. And if in a pecking if you're going like with a grouch or a disguise, you know, with a glass is in the most much dash to the big nose. Maybe he might play him. These are pretty good. We just what I'm in it. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is. That must be it. I don't know what the other reason would be. I mean, we're going to see, you know, not be tempted. You must have tremendous willpower, not to like just a couple of coins and say, you just try your luck. But the only casino I'm at is when I go to Vegas. And I'm just not interested in playing the slots. Okay. We believe you. All right. Joe, secondly says I have a Sicilian girlfriend. She tells me the translation of students is all geez. I've spent. Remember, Joe Schmidt, great linebacker for the detour lines on the years ago before you were born. Last night, heard you say there is no Jesus. Jesus was a historical figure. I think his sterical figure might be. We don't know if there was a Jesus or not. There are several first century historians who have confirmed the existence of Jesus independently of the Bible. Oh, right. The most notable of these was Josephus Flavius, without whom our knowledge of the first century would be very limited. The only account we have of the events that messada for instance came messada. I wonder if that's kind of like Isabella Cassada came from Josephus. He told us there was a man named Jesus who wandered ancient as you're performing miracles and preaching the kingdom of God. He also confirmed the existence of John the Baptist. Mind you, he didn't talk about the divinity of Jesus or whether he was a Messiah or not. Those are matters of faith. They didn't confirm there was a man in the flesh who put that description, who fit that description. And it is very unlikely he decided to perform toward Jesus because your seephus was himself Jewish. He just told it the way it is. Okay, Joe, thanks. Whatever your say man, you'll seephus, he demand. Right? Here's a fact that says, thanks a lot every time I hear butterfly kisses. I feel like getting a vast sick to me or blowing my brains up. Or if maybe you had like a little girl that you weren't planning on just to... You can't even in the lake. Yeah, that might do it. See, sooner or later everything that we got in here comes in handy for some force. There will be a day when this will actually have some, like, some significance. For my, let's get a lot more names on there. We actually put day wants that on there like a little crankboat. He'll get some votes. Sure. One of the sports figures in South Florida. Are there any other sports people like, like, Rickie? Rickie Williams will be there. So it seems a meal, Roger. So it's a special advice for us to ask you, Amy. And... These are Christ. Go, go, go, go. You're going to start my daughter, right? A Christmas morning, I'm going to sh** him. So girl, this girl leads her down. He's making all this, he's checking it, right? If he checked her twice more, that'll make him five, and it falls in tiny, tiny town. Go, you're stupid. I don't think he's taking you when you're stupid. I know when you're happy. He's saying, I want a TV, so go for it. Go for it, go to the site. All you've gotta be done. So be like this. I'm going to quit. And don't you crush that ass, girls, as well as a child. Oh, I'm a child. You must like Santa, I see you. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I can't get any script of pull. What do you say? Even though I don't watch it pretty in a hate-like poison. Yeah. No, big news. And that would laugh. Listen, there wasn't much else going on. We said the ugly, grotesque unnecessary, and the totally gruesome unacceptable war. And the tricks to listen, I noticed nobody said John Kerry, do we really want to do that? Do we want to go there? Do we think you'll get any votes? Well, put them on there. Dave Wands said, it's already got two and Ricky's got one. Here's a fact that says, hey, Neil, here's some words to live by. When trying to talk to the right wing nut jobs. From the Bible Book of Proverbs 1622, I quote, Wism is a fountain of life for the wise, but trying to teach stupid people as a waste of time. This is an exact quote from the Bible. Says this. Facts are. But I read it. Trying to teach stupid people as a waste of time. And that is, uh, Absolutely correct. Trying to share over that. Oh, speaking of John Kerry in fixed elections, the Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice yesterday threw out a challenge to the state's presidential election results. The 40 voters who brought the case will likely be able to re-file the challenge, though. Chief Justice Thomas lawyer ruled that to request improperly challenged two separate election results. Ohio law allows only one race to be challenged in a single completely. Since they're going to have to do it all over again, they will. I'm sure the challenge was backed by the anxious Reverend Jesse Jackson and Cliff Arnebeck, a columnist attorney for the Massachusetts face Alliance for Democracy, the Martinez Bush's campaign of high-tech vote steaming. And those people are. That's so lowly correct. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Painting fraud, voter-cened reports of voting machine errors, double counting of ballots and assorted voting machines, and predominantly minority precincts as reasons to throw out the results. In other words, the darker the precinct, the more votes get tossed out. Ohio and its funny electoral votes, well, we know that. They've determined it. So, what's a mandate he won by a landslide, you know, 119,000 votes. It was 136, now it's 119. I'm sure by the time they get done with all of our recounting and refiguring and re-effixing, it'll be like about 80,000 votes. Oh, it's a big mandate. He's got a lot of political capital to spend. That's why we can go and kill a whole bunch of more people now. And sacrifice more American lives. Let's get some more serious names on this list. I guess it just wasn't anybody like real stand out. And he's stick out in this last year was there. It was kind of like, huh? I mean, Michael Moore, I would think is right. Whoever else is, he's in the lead. He's got a commanding lead and why not. See, I'm not of those people that doesn't apologize for being a big Michael Moore fan. Why the hell should we? You know, I mean, if some people would say, well, I enjoyed the sweet here after I watched him 10 times. But I'm one of those says, I watched a voting for column by an fair and high nine, 11 several times each. And I'm still going to watch him again because Michael Moore is a genius. And he's got a big pair of balls. And he tells it like it is. Michael Moore's 67 for personal year 2004, George's WWE 27, Howard D.N. 18, Peris Hilton 13. And see, when she's got 13 votes, that tells you how weak the field is for this. No, seriously, what is the deal with her? She's ugly, man. She's got a nasty skinny little pin though. She's a pinhead. I mean, you're now, let me ask him a girl about Avril Lavigne. Did you get an email at that center? I got to email. But what is that? There was no message with it. Oh, she's really cute. I like her. Oh, we should have had Miguel on our week. I know it. No wonder I got sandbag on this. Yeah, I'm getting such crap all week long from Josh and from the beast of Avril. Oh, she's describing. She's seen the do it in my real music. Well, it's rather her. She's fine. No, not like some great musicians. She's not going to be like, you know, we weren't judging music or anything. No, no, they're giving me everything. I don't think she's cute. I think she's like a pinhead. She's a pencil head. But I mean, she's cutesy. I would say that. You know that difference between cute and cutesy? Yeah. Yeah. She's cutesy. She's fine. And I know it's Josh and argue with you about it. No, I think she's okay. Look, and I just don't really like her music. Well, that's fine. You don't have to like her music. I don't care what you like it or not. Lady Moran, I have to like vanilla ice cream. I think about what's going on. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, but Brittany's got more than who needs music when you got what she's got, right? You can't really compare. Yeah, I'm pretty pretty Brittany with opera lovin. And then like a little over the top. Yeah. Shame on you, McIr. Yeah. I'm asking up on him. Michael McGill Moore, 69, Bush, 27, Howard D.N. 18, Periscillton, 14, Barack Obama's moving up the latter. He's got 13. He's great. Donald Trump five. They want that. Three. He's the best. Ricky Williams, two. Ken Jennings won. And John Kerry just went on their 150 to votes. That's always been Kerry's problem, Lively. Just a little bit short. WQAM, hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. I have a question. I like to know if you could tell me the answer, if somebody could do some research. Is there a way to cross out the break? I did do the break. Yes, sir. Go ahead. Is it or is it not true that Rudolf Rudolf that Murdock, Rupert Murdock on Syrect TV? It just. People should cancel and droves and either put up and tendons or go back to- Why is that? Because he's a scum. Well, we know that. The fact that a matter is he owns Fox News. There are people every by every cable company's got the Fox News on there. I mean, you can't escape him. He's just too big the runaway from. Do you know that he has Fox News on three different channels if you have direct TV? Really? So you run into a way that you want to or not. And Lively, I just get through saying you can't. And he's like a booge man. Every way to look up your pillow. There's Rupert Murdock. Great. News, papers, TV, magazine, views, new activities everywhere. I have a nomination. I think he's the anti-Christ. Probably right. My nomination would be Raymond J Johnson Jr. You can call me right here. You can call me here. Oh, yes. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. All right. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 0, 5. 5, 5, 6, 6, the under Verizon and Singular Wireless Line. WCQA and hello. Hello? Hello? Yes, sir. Mr. Rogers. Yes, sir, Mr. Crawler?

When it does spread it around. Although I'm here lots of stories about those rest stops. I don't know about too many achiques at the truck stops. You ever heard that? No. You just try to cover his ass with that one. That's about 0.560, pound five 60 and a variety of it. Get all the, yeah, he'll be heads and shoulders. Mostly heads about the other ones. Man, his head is about to size like four people. You know what? That'd be a good pull question. Take something. Who's got the biggest head? What about that's all about? You think, and I'm not saying that's checked in steroids because that would be terrible. I'm sure he did not. Aren't you positive he did not? No. There's no way. No. Not one or a shack. But the fact that a matter is for anybody's head to get that because I don't have to say very bonds head is like gross. It's all well. Not just his ego. But figuratively, but I mean literally as head has become like four times the size that he used to be. WQA and hello. Pretty good. How about Johnny Damen and the World Championship in Boston, RETO? Johnny Damen is the person of the year. Coach Hillin. What about Coward and Sam was just going to say Coach Hillin. We saw hope I was hoping you wouldn't say that because he's a burden and banana. Can we hate it? Yeah, that's why I don't like them anymore because we're going to have to. Okay. Whatever one of these guys want to put on their will put them on. All right. Thank you.

Cuba puts up massive billboard, showing Iraqi prisoner abuse and front of U.S. Mission in Havana. Cuba responded yesterday to the U.S. Guplicit Climansas refusal to take down Christmas decorations by putting up a huge billboard in front of the U.S. intersection in blazing with a swastika, and showing photographs of Iraqi prisoners being abused by American soldiers. The billboard put up overnight had a large swastika in red and the word fascist covered with a made in the USA stamp. It's that prominently on the Amalachone, Madhikone, Havana's coastal highway facing the mission's office. There was no immediate response from American to France in the event. Of course, the US intersection headed by Chief James Kaseon, a gnawed to demand earlier this week to remove Christmas decorations that occluded a reference to this in Celebafan Elcantra's government. The trimmer's included a Santa Claus candy canes and white lights wrapped around palm freezing sound reading 75 irrefference to 75 cumidiscence CL last year. Cuban Parliament speaker Ricardo Alarco and Carl Design rubbers this week and said, Cossonne seems desperate to create problems. Or that Kaseon, Kaseon, or the Kaseon's keep rolling along. Cuba had one of the US's intersectionary move that decorations are face-on specified consequences. No other officials from castors administration have come along the SPAT. Maybe they SPAT on it. Thank you. Probably. We've got to play a lot of Christmas stuff today. Don't worry, I keep saying that and it's already 1203 for crying out loud. We're almost out of here already. That's a shame. And then, oh, right. Here's line nine for the first time today. This is going to be sensational. QAM, hello. Hey, you, I was very, though, not much about American history if you keep comparing to Bush administration and Matthews. Yeah, right. All right, bye. You've up the whispering there, what? No, I'm on the whispering. I was all that came. No, I was a bit too fat. No, okay. 560, 050, 60. What is America? What is American history? Have to do with Nazis, huh? Right. Yeah, I keep kind of, I'm not even going to respond to it. Okay, just that's the whisperer doing trying to do a real call. I guess. Good material man. Oh, maybe here's the real one. QAM, hello. And that's office. Oh. Hey. Ha ha ha ha ha. I've heard from him in a long time. Oh. WQAM, hello. Good, but you're a little bit more. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. No. Good. WQAM, hello. How's going, Neil? Okay, pal. I got a person for the poll. Yeah. How's current? Your buddy. How are current? First of all, the year, 2004. You've got a man on the Y, but oh, and the CF. Have a happy holiday. See, unless you move quickly, like somebody I know used to say in the air, if you move quickly, you can get in now as you sit to with all the lines empty. How are it, Stern? You think he's going to get a lot of votes? He is pioneering. He's leaving the commercial radio behind just in case you haven't heard it for the first 40,000 times. He's going to get serious. And he FCC says, we're not going to tap over that. If you go on there and you all have potty mouth crap, you won. Sounds pretty interesting to me. WQAM, hello. Hello. I'm part of the, Neil. And back to you. Oh, yeah. Do me a favor of keeping in mind that great, uh, dolphin parody song matches show how great they've been to the season. Uh, do you want to play that yesterday? Do you know the show I think? Oh, man, come on. Just score a good reminder and go. Go, Patios, get the kick some dolphin cool with. Okay, thanks, pal. Yeah, I'll play it a little later. Maybe. You think I did not play that right the end yesterday? I think I did. Yes. I'll see. I'll see if the mood strikes me. It seemed to that I'm going to watch the sweet here after again, right in the middle of the show. What are the other? WQAM, hello. Tell us a bit. WQAM, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. About Gary, doesn't it? Oh, yeah. He's the best. He'd be the best. Okay. Yeah, put Gary Benven on there. Just another clown vote. The biggest jackass in the earth. He, uh, he's definitely in the top 10, one of the contenders. Just go and Gary, you idiot. You simple, man. I just, I told you before the show. I don't really care. I just, uh, don't miss it all that much. And I'm here and other people say I screw them all. You know, the hell with him. I have to say it works for one. There's sweet, no plan for somebody. I'll put him on a cannon. He made a ton of these. I have the thing that was, uh, what they've seen, uh, after sign-up contact. Yeah, how about some leaf slunch? Wanna hear something?

Oh, you like R. I mean you must be gay Yeah, oh, yeah, well in both cases you're right like anybody likes R. I'm has to be a fag is that we just saying you like R. I'm yeah I think they're right. Yeah. Oh, you must be gay Miguel I like already actually you must be gay I mean just people are think stupid things why can't you just if you like out in John's music now personally I think he's become an asti old bitch, but but his music is great. Is there any debate about that? He's made a lot of fantastic music but what what mean the beast were kind of saying was like you like ever you Saying well you like Avril's music, but you don't like actually sensing that it's like the same kind of Get out of your way It's like poppy no, no, yes, and I will listen to that sing right he cannot sing Avril of being with the like her music or now, but he like what it comes out at least he can sing She's a performer For instance a Barbie doll she's a simple thing. She's just there because he has he somebody's sister. That's all Which is better Barbie doll either well, I mean I'll be Barbie doll Who lives things come on actually since and comparing anybody to Ashley since and I said about his low-va shot as you can get That's like comparing somebody to William Hong, okay? That's like saying well, Arita, you know, he's not much of a singer. He's like about the same part with William Hong I'll look for modern weekdays. He's a game for anyway He signed a poem not your goodness. I wonder if Anna corner will you just found that out yet? All right, I to me it's like it's Mariah Carey and Luis Miguel all over again I see the same parallels are all at least the energies that appear I'm like Mariah's just got that one big one in the middle of her chest There's another one for a Mariah Carey, can she sing? I mean not at all she is horrendous. You may see a crew sound talented Which you only had like 30 number one hits in a row. Yeah, so that makes you talented Huh Doesn't that prove that doesn't have I don't know how many number one yeah, well, I we don't want to revisit the Elvis thing here That must be that must be the barometer somebody's got a tremendous amount of sound if they have a number one hit If I could look up in my billboard book here on a floor all the number one hits and if we went down the list You'd probably slink out of the room and embarrassment some of the crap that's been number off, but Mariah Carey She's great who's your choice for the tooth that spoof that was then for a person of the year Michael more 142 he's almost a hundred votes ahead you go my 142 George W 53 stole second election.

I mean, the Republicans. That's what their town is. We can't say. It's not a squad. Schmidt. Any more. I mean, we can say certain words. We just can't say them in combination with certain other ones. That's the way it is. And that's pathetic. It really is. It's tragic. And a public like I've told you two years ago. I said, but we wouldn't like that. They've said that. Okay. Whatever you say. Makes sense to me. Logist to small handful. The parents television counsel and handful of individual Waccos from Makosticoast in each market to determine what you can hear from the social media.

But they won't put on for the lava of the beans. You'll see a SpongeBob are going to do pretty well. From the 88 votes. So far, Michael Moore is just the way ahead. 154 and W is got 56 and the word is out that W is going to be time magazines. Man of the year. Rod's a big surprise. I mean, what competition is there? You think time magazine would put Michael Moore on there? Not a Chinaman's chance in purgatory. I'm not going to tell you that right now. No chance. Two chances of that. None and much, much, much, much, much, much less than. No. WQA and hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. Got one for your list. Okay. They ship one, build a route hand. You know, we want the blast rich people up there in the space. Yeah. The man of the year. Not you. No. WQA and hello. Do you know? Yes, the man of the year is God. Well, I know who it is. They all got it. Man must be who he's talking about. The man of the year is God. He did create man in his own image. I wonder if it was like the image of an old goldstein Gilbert. Huh? I'm not really sure which image which God we're talking about. Maybe it was like Tom Brady. He's coming. Thank you. Hello. Can I have a great job? WQA and hello. QAM. Yes sir. I've obviously used to 25 years. What do you do? Best. One of my best people. Yeah. I'm sure not going to like this one. Not that George W. He's on there. He's in seven years. Yeah. I mean, I mean, there's a guy in the middle of the night. He stole a second election for in square. What's wrong with that? That's a good year for him. How many votes is he has? 59. Oh. Hello. By the day of probably a 459. Because you know, the Republicans won't let Michael more steal. And how many we can, pal? Okay. Good honor. Yeah. They're making events. How many votes? Any contest. He's in all the Senate like kind of like, oh yeah. And Michael more probably lose half of the votes by the time we sit down Monday morning. Don't forget now George will be back Monday. He's been on vacation this week. And of course, let's see, starting there. Through the other vacation for eight days won't that be great. Oh yeah. That will be sensational. So that guy that wasn't maybe for the semi-definite Jake to snake whatever he was. I wanted to George. There you go. In fact, I heard it's going to be a special psychic. You're going to have to make way for Maddie Velos going to be in there with George next week. So what I'm hearing, John. Yeah. You're going to be sitting on George's line. WQAM Hello. Neil. Yes sir. For your Paul. Bill come out. Bill come out. Jack asked somebody said that. OK. Leave her alone. OK. He's up the river. She's singing Swanley River. For a minimum of five years. Wow. He's going to have plenty of chance to cool his heels and his. Correct. Mass in there. Five long years. He just wanted a little friend. Somebody QA and hello. Hey Neil, how you doing? Pretty good. How about a how it's there? He's on there. Oh, okay. OK. OK. Don't get panicky. How is our. How's the. Let me take a look. He's behind our. I mean, he's behind the. Periscillin. How is got 13? He's like in the middle of the pack. In fact, he's one behind Ken Jennings. Periscillin is tired with Barack Obama. You know, when I think of Barack Obama who's printed articulate. Outspoken fourth right makes a lot of sense. A tremendous success story in his own. I think of Periscillin right along with that. Don't you? Very equivalent. Completely. Yeah. And I have one for your poll. Yes sir. Sandy Claude. Sandy Claude. Oh yeah. Then I'm a sound like Woody to me. That's kind of just like Woody to me. Trying to do like a little more macho voice. You're still a fruit cake. OK, Woody. That was not. If it was not. I apologize to whoever was. But I'm sure it was. Sandy Claude. How do I all you kids out there? There's a reasonable Sandy Claude. That's why when you go to all the different shopping malls. You see, some fat Santa and little skis. I think that's a little bit of a big deal. I think that's a little bit of a big deal. I think that's a little bit of a big deal. That's why when you go to all the different shopping malls. You see, some fat Santa and little skinny or Santa and a much fat Santa. Because they're all like a bunch of fakers. OK, there ain't no Sandy Claude. It's just a bunch of a pack of lies so that your parents can do a lot of business. So the merchant can do business. That's all. And as far as this thing, I got another stir which I'll never get to. Thank goodness because you want him to read. But groups push the religious displays of Christmas. Every day this week we've had story conservative Christians finding a poor Christ back in public. Christmas displays have two new weapons in our arsenal this holiday season. The reelection of President Bush and Conservative commentator Bill O'Reilly, who in between making a scene phone calls is screaming the own about the Christians are getting discriminated. Here's the thing. Christmas trees had nothing to do with Christmas. It's a custom. OK, now they have something to do as far as religious is concerned. It has nothing to do with religion. So the idea that we shouldn't have Christmas trees in public building is so ridiculous to me. I mean those people are way overboard. So that's called pushing a good thing too far. Keeping religion separate separate the church and state extremely important. It's a last straw we have to grasp on it. It's all we got. We don't have a holiday tree. No, no, but seriously, what difference is it make what you call them? They're not a religious party religious observance. Okay. Just like Christmas carols are like jingle bells. Is jingle bells have to do with the Jesus? I don't think so. He'll tell us that there's a big one the J. Jesus bells. Do you understand? So the people that carry it to an extreme. They're the ones who create the opening here for the religious nuts to come in. You see they wouldn't even let this put a Christmas tree. Well, why don't I? And I don't care what anybody says. I will guarantee a picture of many bells like on a right now that there are Christmas trees and maces and birdines and blooming nails and where right? Yeah. Do you know that there are? So just cut the crap already and everybody's going to get along really really well. Yeah. Everybody is hitting each other. I want my decoration. I want my amin' aura. I want my Christmas tree. I want my annitivity scene. Blow it out your ass. Okay. Grow up already and get a life. And stop with the fairy tales. All the crap that's going on in the world that any wonder why it's going on. Because all these people are arguing and killing each other over their own fairy tales. It's stupid man. It's stupid. And you know who told me there ain't nothing worse than stupid? Yeah. He said don't be stupid. He said. Your buddy. I think he's going to get any votes. Probably not. Let's take a look at it. More Howard David. Got three votes already. How do you like that? I already pan three. I'm a Levine Don't Have Any. And more Howard David. It's got three. So what do you know? Hey, I want to know the holiday season is here full time. Now full steam ahead and the folks that I'm strong for the homestead want to thank all their loyal customers for their business interest.

What other sports stuff has happened this year? How about Tom Brady? See, I still maintain that in the midst of that was the most exciting super bowl. In history. What dramatic ending? Huh? Didn't see it. Yeah. Nobody's talking. Too busy. What about Janet Jackson's booby? About the booby flat. That just goes to show you another example. What is really desperately wrong with America that the FCC and all of America's up into a tizzy about the little booby there. It half time. And again, what's phenomenal? I say put Tom Brady on there. Two super bowls in three years ain't bad. Plus they only lost one game this year so far. Twelve and one eight two shabby, right? You're going to put a sports guy on there. What about Tom Brady? Huh?

I don't think I could handle it. I just jumped by by. I think we'd just in Tinkerbell on there? No, we're good. Ha ha ha ha. So just in Tinkerbell. Now there's another one of those stories. It's like in Rikke and Anna Cornohoye, you know? Just in Tinkerbell and Brittany. Are you believe in that? No, she's got pretty bad taste. That's another reason I think she's dropping down. So she keeps consulting with these slimy nasty trailer tracks, she queen, whatever. You know, that gives me hope. That's true. That's true. And either one of you would be a big improvement or what she's hanging with. I mean, we have no idea. I would be a big improvement. How do you like that? That's saying a lot. Now she's, she needs some help with that eyesight. Oh, let's see. Brittany don't have any. Gary, uh, Gary, Batman, Brittany, Scourge, Peyton Manning have the big. Oh, and how do you like that?

Hold John Henry, man. Just a joke. Don't put him on or whatever you do. You did. John Henry. Well, he sure liked me a lot. That organization when he was around. And at the time, I never forget that morning I came in the studio and we were somebody. So I'm more than Neil and all of a sudden, John Henry and all his henchmen are standing around with their pinstrips so it's they gave me a look like I had just the one.

What? But you know something I survived it seven months man It's one of the great miracles in this year's video Nobody knows about it. It's one of the least talked about things Seven months of a talk show without a phone call That of course was back when they screwed us over the first time But at nine to one stuff didn't work out too well But nevertheless we used to get in like the anchor round The longer an immigrant lives in the U.S. The more likely there ought to be obese The corn was studied in December 15th Issue of Jama Since the 80s the U.S. population has become more obese We know that however little information is available about the prevalence of obesity Among immigrants the fastest growing 70 of the U.S. population currently comprising more than 11% of the totally West population And even larger per fourth of many minority groups Immigrants generally originate from countries where they are a prevalence of obesity is lower than that of the U.S. Which is almost anywhere But adopting U.S. norms over time may lead to an increasing prevalence of obesity See this whole thing this is one of the studies What do you like to have in a Swiss bank account somewhere just a fraction of the money They got probably stupid ass studies to figure out things that we already know Right? Yeah, that would be nice Yeah, I like if somebody comes here from Norway for example Pick any place from Denmark and they're here a few years Oh, they're going to get fat.
