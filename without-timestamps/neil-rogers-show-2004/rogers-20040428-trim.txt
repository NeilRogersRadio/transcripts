Can I want it 560WQM happy Wednesday to a man that pressure is building toward 1130 tomorrow morning. Can't you smell it? I spill something. Well, that's because love threw him not too long ago. He left a lingering aroma because of the pressure that's building toward the big book coming out tomorrow. I think that this rating book may be the most cataclysmic in the history of the sunflower market. Don't I always say that? No. I mean, once in a while I'll say, I think this portends our future or something like that. But I think tomorrow is the dividing line. And it's a question of who's going to be crossing that line and who's going to like just kind of collapse. Anyway, we're getting the bad. Because let's see, we got let's see. And then 24, 25 and a half hours. Let's do it. Let's do it. 25 hours, 20 minutes. But who's counting? Till his numbers start coming out tomorrow. And I think WBGG could be the most unbelievable collapse in history of sunflower market. They're just going to vanish. This life has station in San Diego. Team town is going to get there. It's baby. I'm turning that back to tomorrow. They're going to take a dump. Now the good news about Felugi is that the ceasefire is still in effect. That's what they're telling us. The bad news is we're watching the battle going on with the Marines and the insurgents as we speak. It's been on for like an hour and a half. So the idiots had seen in who consider that you're all got the mentality of a three year old are telling us roughly that all the good news is the ceasefire is still in effect. The bad news is of course they're like having a huge contract with us. Just isolated incidents. That's why I let Smoke has been billowing up in the air for like the last several hours. At any rate. What are we doing there? Who's we? What are they doing there? Look for the killer. We've been to day five to seven and anchors away at Beach Place in Fort Lauderdale stopped by the spin-to-veal for prizes. And that's a little while ago.

Which of these people best bits of description of two gay? Now some of you got it and many of you didn't get it. Many of you just as usual thought. Oh, just name a bunch of people you think are gay. Just name some people you suspect being a fag. That's where that Louis Anderson. And I want to retract my apology that guy yesterday. I'm supposed to feel bad because I thought he was full of crap.

I'm going to go along with that critical cost. It facts. We got a couple of days ago from JJ. BB whatever was in the Pembroke finds. Today we're just Biden time. We're just running off the clock. Right. Because tomorrow when those number of worse fashion and a toast and welcome to the coast. When the numbers come at level 30 tomorrow, it's going to be just a wild time. You know, we'll see. I think we'll do fine. We'll be okay. Oh, we're fine. But the chief channel stations they must be getting real nervous about the reaction of the audience to their crap. And you might be interested in knowing which company bought out more acquired more stations in 2003 than any other. You got to write. Chief channel. Oh. Yeah. They don't have enough already. Okay. The first two hours today. Which of these people best fits the description of two Cuban? We did two Jewish and the first two hours yesterday. Two gay in the second two hours. And which of these people best fits the description of two Cuban? I only started with two. Ilyana Ross Latenin and Alex Penellus.

Raman's sower census. Yeah. What a piece of crap. Does he still go up and down the intercostal and is yacht with his pet baggage? Yeah. Now on our behind-the-be the curtain thing, they would like to give it a little heads-up on that to start of the show. We didn't take a peek at it. If you're going to age a 55 and have many poe-up pieces of ID. It's e-m-on again. No, it's not. It isn't? No. Of course not. Who is it? It's Carrie Werner. Oh, you didn't change the picture on me. Right on you. I don't understand. Why do you do that? That wasn't the picture we had of e-m-on yesterday. It wasn't the practice picture. Oh, and so I don't have any, uh, that's a file. I don't have any bio. I don't have any info. I don't even know who she is. Carrie Werner. Sure. She's been in a lot of movies. She showed her breasts a lot. Then she started feeling self-conscious about it and took her in. Plants out. No. You never see him again. She was also a very Werner. I mean, you were, while you're doing the break, I'm going to be in a Simon. I have some to do there. She's at that TV show of sliders. How about your part? Slide around. Sliders.

Uh-huh. What the beast. So anyway, that's our new pool. And I got some stuff. First of all, before I see there, they're going to go nuts with this Cuban thing. You'll see. Oh, yeah. It was Cubans. Cubans. And rightfully so. Suspicious white powder found in mail and built kittens office. Former president built kittens office was briefly evacuated yesterday.

Maybe it was kind of like a piece offering from my. His success. Oh, he was some of those leftovers from several years ago. Could be. Although we don't want to hear about that because what he did 30 years ago is not important whether carry through those metals over the fence or not. Well, that's very, very important indicates he's just unfit to serve. I got a very, very scary column here from the village voice. We're coming to read. John Kerry must go. I'll get to it.

Carrie Warner is behind a beat of curtain today. Really great news is that got my full test results here from Hollywood Diagnostic Center. Yeah, and it said you're still alive. It says, in fact, if you look good on the outside is you run inside, you'd be in good shape. Hey, we can't all look good on the outside. As a matter of fact, when you get to be this age, because it really doesn't make them a different setting, or anyway, you're just real happy to look good on the inside. I should probably read this whole thing about the total body scanning proceeds from the skull base through the level of the pubic synthesis. Can we say pubic synthesis? Oh, so I'm not reading it. Let me know when you're going to read that whole thing. Okay. 567560, pound 560 on the AT&T of rise in wireless line. Iliana Ross Layton and Alex Penelis. It looks like I got a couple of good pair on there to start with. You know, who else we need to put on there? I mean, he'll be like, not sooner. So Rick Sanchez. Oh, yeah. He's a possible winner of two polls just a few days on his show. Few of his can make that claim except only one that I can take out. Absolutely. And all man. Tell the EQA in hello. Yeah, it's a good morning for your board. Yes, I'm on his latest. Mars, we see. That's enough. I hope you don't have it yet. And okay, thank you. I was to came your lead us. Well, no, he's going to send another one. Yeah. Okay, what? Well, one. See, which of these people best fits the description to Cuban, which we allow you one of peace, whichever one you think is the most to Cuban. There are many, many people. I'm sure we think are to Cuban just like the one to Jewish and to gay and to black, which we'll do later on and to, uh, whatever. I think these four cover pretty well on you. Yeah. Now, they're over going to. If we were going to do a poll on who do you spies the most, what's offload of well-known person? You hate the most. Moan Rich Sanchez. I think we've done that many times in a pass because they like to unleash their hatred. You know, it's always OJ and Moan. OJ and Moan, not Rich Sanchez? No. Oh, I think you're making a mistake. We might have to do that later on this week. I'm sure maybe tomorrow. Do you want to be a QAM? Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Does Sam? Sounds like me. Hey, how are you today? Pretty good. I'm standing. I'm just calling about that awesome lighting game last night. Did you want it? It was a great game over time, man. They tied it up with 16 seconds left in Ilekabadiay and then Freddy O.D. in the X-LEE factor scores the winning goal a minute and someone to overtime. You know what? I think they're for real. They are for real and even better news is Calgary beat Detroit and the late game through the two last night. So, somebody's going to be right. Yeah. Yeah. Detroit's got a lot of old players in Detroit. That's right. The very physical team. They're going to knock the crap out of the old teams are going to fall by the way. So I'd include my beloved Toronto make believes. I think are. So the old guys, you know, they're done. How about Tampa Bay and Calgary in the Cupflail? Can you imagine a ratings for that? Well, that was a great day. Thanks a lot, Caly. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon. I'm sure we had how many people in this audience watched Tampa Bay, my troll last night. I'm through to man. How many fans, baby? They're into it deeply. Make no mistake, I'm through to. When do you think? Huh? I have to play some Leafs TV. There's Jim, what's his name? Papin. All the same. I can't have the name. Jim, Papin. Actually, don't be tapping now because Duffel, come right now. What's that sound? What's that sound like? Yeah. It's great. It's great. Thank you. You're sir. How about Gloria Stepa or her husband? I can't find her. Gloria is an excellent. But forget about him. He's small potatoes. Gloria is perfect choice. Thank you. Thank you so much. And, uh, I'm sorry. There's a lot of it. Oh, Lord. Oh, yeah. Gloria Stepa, she can't sing. She's annoying. And she just won't go away. It's one of those kind of people. She just refuses to leave the scene. Kind of like Ellis Ruben. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. No, seriously. Just keep hanging around, hanging around, hanging around. Hey, Ellis, we know you got a lot of publicity and go have a good life. Get out of our face. WCWM. Hello. Hey, how long many deas? Perfecto. Do Kubano man. Mochis Gracia's a me girl. You got it, what? Are we good or two? Oh, sorry. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. This article here. I don't know. And there's another one by Max Castro. I don't want to sit here read a lot of bedtime. So, especially not the Josh's back miss falling a lot of names. But the one by Max Castro from back March 15 in progress a weekly. And I think the person who sent this to me from I'm ahead of Sidneyer. And I never got around to reading it. I think today would be a propitious time. Not the whole thing. It's too dang long. But just enough of it. I mean, it's pretty long. You know? No, I don't know. It's called Israel and the State of Democracy in Miami. Another tremendous shot at the Harold. By Max Castro is columnist and carried by the Harold any more you'll notice. Who exposes them for the pandlers and the fakers. They are. Boy, do we hate the Harold on this show? Oh, what? Huh? The spy. And the Sun sent us as the piece of crap. You know, they are what they are. But the Harold goes the extra nine yards to be a real pandering piece of turd. By the way, Glenn Garvin, nice job on a radio censorship and EFCC. Nice job lately, man. You're really on top of it. He's got some crap tough piece about some piece on a PBS tonight about the who knows what I don't know. That's his article today. Glenn Garvin, man, you are so out of touch. You fit in perfect with that newspaper. God forbid that anybody who's supposed to be like the radio TV person for either newspaper. The newspaper really writes regularly about radio. At least, Jick has written a few columns. I've turned him in. I bought all the censorship stuff. Although I know this, he's back in, he's revered a deform. WDQA and hello. Hello. Yes, sir. On the pole? Yes. Elliot Rodriguez. Elliot Rodriguez. On the channel for News, which I despised like poison. Very good choice. Thank you. Yeah, what he gives us is always to John this eyes. You know what I mean? Yellow. All Elliot Rodriguez. That's one of the reasons that a lot of people despised Channel for News is because they know there's no objectivity. And back during the Alienito days, when Rick Sanchez was actually on the ear, making phone calls to the cell phone in that car. Do you guys necessarily you talk about number one being interfering. Number two having no credibility whatsoever. I mean, being so emotionally racked up in a whole thing that he's making editorial comments on the ear, as he's going along and trying to call him, Oh, turn around and go back to me. He's been canceled, which sure not to be bogus. Bad information. And luckily, they were either one answer to the cell phone, or there were busy ordering happy meals for Alienito for when he got to Sister Jean the Dancing Machine's palace. Wow. What a, what a sad state of affairs. You know, cell phone has got so much potential beautiful beaches, beautiful palm trees, the ocean, all of these things, you know. All of these things. Right. Man, if we could just arrange a people trans, but it would be dang pleasant. And, you know, I mean, there is a strong advice. July and August, when we could live without it. A little bit too hot in human mosquitoes, a size of bowling balls, but other than that, it could be fabulous if you'd be able to hear that rather fair expression paradise. It could be paradise. Absolutely. Without him, which of these people best fits the description of two Cuban, Ilyana Ross Latenin Scott. But third man, Alex Penelas 15, Desi Arnez, Odev's Bowie's Closer, sick of a six, Maris Grecia's four, Ramon's Salle Sanchez three, Rick Sanchez three, Gloria Stefan one, and many of these guys are going to move up later soon. I'm sorry. I'm just gonna move up later soon. I'm just gonna move up later soon. I'm just gonna move up later soon. I'm just gonna move up later soon. Oh, Pan 31, how could we have gone as long and not head him on there already? I thought of him. How about she's on her right now, though? So, Cahoyo, I can't wait to see how Josh spells that. And now Eric emails me with kind of a caustic note here about how he changes the picture in the, of behind the being a critten 9-30 every morning. Okay. A little shot there. I'm almost positive that was not the same picture of E-Mond that we had on the yesterday. I don't know. It was a different one. I can be wrong about that. I'm pretty sure. By the way, Desi Arnaz is spelled correctly in the poll, so I don't know. It is now. What do you think? What do you think? What you were talking about is what I was going to say. When you said he almost has it spelled right before the break? Oh, I don't know. Okay. All I know is that there is no Z and Z-Loo. And anyway, now see, in the right, you're assuming off course there. And by the way, it's not 9-30 every morning or it's more like 9-45. Not that it makes any difference, but let's get it right. Okay. If you want to nitpick and start a big song today, and some of the pictures behind it, you do a wonderful job, Eric, just calm down a little bit. Some of those really good breakfast reedos would cheese are very, very good for it. That does not get stabilizes blood sugar. The ones from Burger King. What do they call those? I from Burger King? Some. Yeah. No, no, no, no, they're breakfast. I'll take that. That's only good thing they have. What the hell do they call those? Is there, uh, all the, uh, cross sandwiches? I thought that was a duck and doughnuts. No, it's a cross sandwich. It has bacon, cheese, and you, of course, they're not the egg. Ooh, bacon and cheese. Right, they have a cross. That's the only thing in the world that we want to Burger King is a cross sandwich with the bacon, cheese, tongue, uh, hold the egg. Because that thing don't even, it's never even new in egg. Much less resembled one. Move on.org. I give out a check this out. May 8th, hundreds of grassroots groups in tens of thousands of us will join forces in the biggest one day voter mobilization effort in American history says my email. To get the will contact over a million voters in register over 250,000 folks to vote, we'll also prove to Republicans an immediate that while president Bush may have more money, we have the power, the people power to win. This ever builds on the more than 7 million hours move on members pledged in 50 for the future fundraising campaign and it goes on to tell what you can do and what it's all about. And, uh, it's hit her and so on. Move on.org. When it does, check it out. Please. John Kerry must go. Note to Democrats, it's not too late to draft someone anyone else's James Ridgeway. It's on our website. It was in a village voice. With the air gushing out of John Kerry's balloon, it may only be a matter of time until political and sad is a Washington-Face-the-dred reality that the junior senator from Massachusetts doesn't have what it takes to win and it's got to go. As arrogant and out of it is the Democratic political establishment is even these polls know the parties got to have someone to run against George Bush. They can't exactly expect the president to self-destruct into thin air. With growing issues over his wealth, which makes fellow political at Bush seem maturity case by comparison, the miasma over his metals and ribbons or ribbons and metals, his unspiring record the Senate, yes or nowhere, and wish he washy efforts to mimic Bill Clinton's triangulation gimmick relief, protractor factor, Kerry sinks day by day. The pros all know that the candidate who starts each morning by having to explain himself as a goner. What to do? Look for them biggies, whoever they are these days, to sit down with the rich and arrogant presumptive nominee and try to persuade him to take a hike. They can then return to businesses' usual resurrecting John Edwards who's still hanging around or staging an open convention in Boston or both. The things precedes they are, the Jim Bob Demo-Credit leaders are going to be very sorry they screwed how we're Dean is what it said. On a one hand you really don't want to read that. On the other hand you're saying, well, have I been saying that last few days? Yeah. That he's really leaving me really limp. But in any rate, just past that long for your information, 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line, which in these people best fits the description to Cuban. Not there, W.N. Hello. Yes, I want to have somebody to hear a poll now. Yes sir. They can deal with the light. I'm beautiful choice, anybody with that last name. Yes, definitely. And also remember, we have to ban the Bush brothers. Okay. Bye. See. We like to blues brothers. We just don't like to brush brothers, right? Right. Or Brooks brothers. We like to brush brothers too. And they're great likes, they're suits. In fact that's about the only kind of sudie likes. Lincoln Diaz Velard. That's what the hype and by the way, I'm sure you're worried that Jarster is a hype in a near. And stop between the Lincoln and the Diaz. Hey, listen, I'm just trying to like help him along. Here's not too familiar with this big stuff. Ballad the art. Let's see. Ilyana Ross, late in his gut 40. Alex Penelis 22. Maris Gracie S. Gonzalez 13. Vizzi Arnez. We have it spelled right down nine. Rick Sanchez 7. Gloria Stefan 6. Ramon Sol Sanchez 5. Now we get Rodriguez from Channel 4. We lose in news one. Many Diaz and Joe Carroyo out of 103 votes have none. They got the big so far. That's amazing. I was your Carroyo just went on there. And Lincoln Diaz Velard will be on their momentarily. I'm sure once. Once Josh figures out where the hype and goes. We're just to get. They're going to put several all through. Just just to be on the safe side. Not a bad idea. In fact, it's like us. We put a lot of like. That deep. It's not necessarily they belong here. Just to keep stuff calm down. How about you, you and hello. Yes sir. Are you doing pretty good? My vote was going to be for a billion of lost lately. But that you already had on it. I got one that won't make your poll. He's no celebrity. It's my brother's girlfriend. She's Cuban. She wouldn't have sex with him for like three weeks. You know why? Because the tarot guy.

Two Cuban. Which would be a great lead in that Max Castro thing I'll do it next time. It's long. Israel and the state of democracy in Miami. Max Castro is the best writer that they ever had. I think Carl Heissen had some good people over the years, but Max Castro was the greatest because he actually had a ball to tell the truth that the Harold ever had fired. You're right. WQAM, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Pretty good. I can't believe that nobody's done this yet. Christina, the Pacho host. Christina. Yeah. She's pretty Cuban man. And I got a no for you. Pretty her, yes. Yes.

Francis, go over it now, did we get Christine on there? Would I get our Skipper with that too fast? Francisco, a Ruga is the veteran of the show on him. What what time is he on? I don't know. He's a Cuban establishment bash her, which is what I know. I know that. He's a good guy. Right. He's somebody we like, so let's not put him on there. Maybe we won't do who's not Cuban enough. Right. Who's not Cuban enough? Who's not gay enough for the likes of him dead? Right. Like rock Hudson wouldn't have been gay enough, although the fact he looked pretty good, they would like them anyway, the professional queens. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, I'll speak to that kind of thing. Elton John says American Idol vote is racist. That's what she's saying. British Rockstar Elton John and guest judge this month on US Town Huts TV series American Idol said yesterday that he found the voting by the National Viewing Audits incredibly racist. John who were the wannabe pop stars perform as Sarah songs during an appearance on the Fox TV show, added his voice to a course of dissent that felt last week's shock exit of Black vocalist Jennifer Hudson considered one of the top talents among those Vine forever quoting contract. The three people I was really impressed with and they just happened to be Black young female singers. They all seemed to be landing in the bottom three said John, commenting on the telly in which the lowest vote getaways eliminated. They have great voices, she said. The fact that they're constantly in the bottom three and I don't want to set myself up here, but I find incredibly racist. Ms. John said a news conference for voting for Radio City Musical Concert back by an orchestra of students from London's Royal Academy of Music and the Judy Arts School of New York. The show often gets more than 20 million people voting. The other two singers grouped in the bottom three of the seven remaining American Idol finalist last week where Black Davis, Latoya London and Fantasia Burriy body. The results moved the show host Ryan Sequest remind viewers that the series was a talent hunt and not a popularity contest. America don't forget you have to vote for the talent secret 74 closing the show. You can't let talent like this slip through the cracks through the, sorry, Fox TV decline to comment, Black Koo and her Rubin stuttered one the top prize last year. But things are changing now a little bit. Looks like. So Ms. John has all been out of shape. Good thing though he's an acrobat. That's what he tells us. The 567.0.560. Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. See I just say the lines to myself the ones I can't say anymore. And I get kind of like a sign. Yeah, I can kind of like a silent circle out of them.

Look for the QM van that a 567 anchors away at beach place in Fort Lauderdale. Stop by the wind and wheel for prizes. And we're just to win 300 scratch off tickets from the Florida lottery. Which is a major rip off by the way. It's at the Anchors Away Party for Air and Sea Show today at beach place. And a lot of reason without the newty crap, you know. Just give us a lump sum if we win 15 million. Give us the 15 million. No taxes like they do here in Canada. And just give us the lump sum and opposite newty crap. What a rip off that is. So I say, we're going to hang out of your money that you supposedly think you're getting. We'll give you like a little lump in the beginning. Somebody ought to give them a lump. Oh, just in.

The pattern of pandering at the Miami-Herald is even deeper and broader than most of the paper's critics realize. But it comes to pandering to the most conservative sectors of key constituencies, marginalizing dissident voices and stifling debate with an editorial page. The Miami-Herald and El Del Wavo here will don't stop with Cuba, or even would let in America. Uh-huh. Increasingly, the same narrowing of the spectrum of opinion applies not only to Cuba, but also to commentary about other countries of Latin America, especially Venezuela. If the balance of political forces in Venezuela reflected the ratio of programment to anti-gapment articles in the opinion pages of El Del Wavo here, Cuba's Chavez would lose any election by nearly 100% of the vote. Miami-Herald and the Taurils, columns and commentaries, and Venezuela are nearly as one-sided as those in El Del Wavo here, all that almost as stride and as those on Cuba. Indeed, on Cuba, Venezuela and Latin American general, the editorial pages of Miami-Herald have been converging through the monolithic El Nguibo-Herald model. It's no wonder, before you assume the Herald post-Alberto-Avacuen was the publisher of El Nguibo-Herald. In a state that El Nguibo-Herald established new standards for pandering to the Cuban right, and is slowly when he published a special section on the occasion of the death of Cuban American National Foundation Chairman, Jorge Mascanosa, who had waged a merciless campaign against the Herald, and Eva Guendagüins boss her publisher David Lawrence. Under Eva Guendagüins' watch, El Nguibo-Herald also reached new heights of incompetence, and lack of accountability when a published a Sunday front page features story about a doctor that reportedly attended to Del Castro as Elena Coma, and Eva Ana Hospital, every assertion in the detail the counter not to be false, but the paper never investigated the hopes to apologise to readers. But no misty goes unremorted in the age of total corporate greed. Night-ritter, the Herald's parent company, which had just moved its headquarters Miami-Dessan Jose, California, to get away from the mading Cuban crowd, soon promoted Eva Guendagüins. Not for his not-existent journalistic accomplishments, but because Eva Guendagüins promised he could deliver a 22% profit annually even if he had to tear the guts out of the Herald's journalistic tradition, or make a pact with the city's right wing devils from the Cuban American National Foundation to the Alfa right wing radio personalities. By the time the federal raid to remove Eliana took place, Eva Guendagüins had become the Miami Herald publisher, that was in control of both the Herald and El Nuevo Herald. He took advantage of the fact to wish you a special edition of El Nuevo Herald which had a line, shame, explanation point. But the Herald's bias in Perocule pandering doesn't stop with Latin America, when it comes to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, it's not just that the Herald publishers are plethora of pro-Israeli views to the virtual exclusion of pro-Palestinian perspectives. It's not even just the fact that the paper's regular off-ed contributors include Israeli columnist while Palestinian columnist don't appear in the paper, even as occasional guest columnist. It's also an especially the fact that the paper's opinion columns lead heavily toward the heart of the positions while almost in variable exclude and critical voices, the heart of line positions at this, critical voices in Israel and the American Jewish community. On all the points above, the Herald's editorial reacts to the assassination of Sheikh Ab Ab Ahsmaid Yasin, the spiritual leader of the Palestinian-Palestinian-Millison group Hamas by the Israeli military, is instructive, or rather the Herald's lack of reaction. The newspaper that probably publishes more commentary about Israel than any other daily in the U.S., failed to take editorial notice of a very major event. Silence can be more significant than words, would the Herald of Insan had this kind of extrudusion in judicial execution been carried out by any other state? The papers at a twirl pass reflects the maximum if you can't say anything good, don't say anything. And how could they say anything good? The elimination of Yasin was condemned by nearly everyone in the world including our best friends and allies such as the U.K.s Foreign Minister Jack Straw, even the Bush administration, which in the person of national security adviser Condoleezza Rice initially attempted to toirationalize the killing, was forced to backtrack after realizing death and breath of the world's revoltsion. The U.S. government, through a spokesman, eventually pronounced itself deeply disturbed a far milder reaction than that of other governments. A U.N. Security Council resolution condemning the killing obtained broad support but failed because of a U.S. veto. President Bush failed to offer even a token protest in deed instead he went ahead with plans to meet with Serona Washington April 14, and the U.K. Meanwhile, a Jewish member of Parliament, Mr. Kaufman, denounced the visit as giving a seal of approval to the Shoron's policy of indiscriminate killings of Palestinians. The Harold Silence on the Yasin killing topic is part for the course but it's also an abdication responsibility. In significant ways the U.S. is implicated in the rubbing out of the Hamas leader, the helicopter used to kill the U.S. in American Apache helicopter through military assistance, massive economic support and the diplomatic shield of the U.S. veto at the U.N., the United States enables these Shoron government to carry out its iron fist policy with total impunity. As to rack Ali is written a new book Bush in Babylon the recalmization of Iraq. By making aerial Shoron a co-leader in the war on terrorism the regime in Washington consciously blurt the distinction between national liberation and terror. The result has been catastrophic and now the day passes without an email from Israel and Palestine informing me of the latest atrocity he writes. Every Arab and Muslim in the world understands this connection and it's clear that resimbed over American compliance with Shoron's brutal policies could well cause enormous damage to the American people and US interest in the world. Let's make one thing clear, not withstanding the fact that Palestinians live under a humiliating occupation that makes every day their lives miserable. The numerous indiscriminate acts of terror and murder against Israeli civilians carried out by Palestinian extremists are a vulnerable morally and counterproductive politically as is the violent esemitism expressed by far too many in the Arab world. On the other hand even in the wake of the Asim killing and open letters signed by 60 leading Palestinian intellectuals rejected violence and called for non violence resistance to occupation. The plot is not to hold a contest of evil versus virtue putting Israelis against Palestinians the point is that however Republican the atrocities perpetrated by Hamas or Islamic Jihad American taxpayers are not paying for them and our government is not rationalizing or providing political cover for these horrific actions. Can the same be said we respect the morally Republican actions of the Shoron government in Israel? Tudu is pattern of petty padring the Miami-Herald is mum on all of these issues. What the paper did publish is a large number of letters all but one is in support of the assassination and a pathetic column by its regular contributor, Erie Dromy, directed the international outrage at the Israeli democracy Institute and which they objectifies the killing by an humiliating the reasons I didn't like Asim. Undoubtedly most people in the Arab and Muslim world would could list myriad reasons why they didn't like Shoron. Would this justify the Syrian or Iranian government's killing the Israeli Prime Minister would the fact that the killing could place as these Israeli leader left the synagogue merit special condemnation? The Dromy piece doesn't spare cliches not even the 72 virgins are left out and leaves no room for doubt or nuance. Dromy reduces the world wide out cry against the Asim killing to the notion that some people are just bashing Israel for killing him. Dromy's column reads like straight propaganda but then again what exactly is an international outreach coordinator. The Hurl's pandering here at Tain's A brazen level, the paper's main commentator on Israeli policy and issues is in Israeli propaganda. That's balance. The contrast could not be sharper between the narrow hacked view of the Asim killing your spread in the Hurl's single column on the topic and the wide range of views expressed in Israel, including sharp criticism in the press. Indeed even inside Shoron's cabinet there was a decenero posed the assassination. Israeli commentators have questioned the wisdom of the hit. It's political and economic repercussion that it's potential for escalating the violence to a higher level. Israeli analyst didn't shy away from posing the toughest questions and with a harshness seldom encountered in the US press easily intimidated by Spurius charges of anti-Semitism leveled by hard-line pro-Lakud sectors in the US and it goes on at like mass Castro. He's great. You go max. Yeah you go rip the hell in ass while the Ziravman. The panders. Man are they nauseating. I think I'm going to cancel my subscription to the Hurl. The only reason I've buy it is because you know I'm down there a few weeks a year. Yeah. I'm going to get a subscription just like in canceling. There. There you go. Everybody call out there. Get a subscription canceled tomorrow. It's up throwing the L-Herald on my front lawn. You. You. Aint holes? Yeah. I'm sure that's what you were going to say. I thought what I was thinking though. I'm sure it wasn't. You're probably thinking of like class holes something like that. Mass holes. Right. Spaz holes. Much of spaz holes that they're. I'll make a mistake about it. Twenty-till noon at five sixty. Nobody can't look for the QM fan five to seven anchors away at beach place in Fort Lauderdale this afternoon.

Got my report in the mail. All by up here in Toronto they served a Senate certified mail and it's pretty good news. They said I'll say it again. They said if you look is good on the outside. As you do on the inside you'd be beautiful. Unfortunately though. But anyway. This is the good news. I had the total body scan. I had the heart scan. In fact they were shocked to fight a heart inside this age at old body. A lot of people in the audience would say he ain't got one. I had one and not only that. You mama. Because it's in pretty good shape. Nobody wants to think about having cancer heart disease any of the mirrored of diseases that the Lord influx upon us as we continue suffering through life. But nevertheless. It's a proven fact that disease responds extremely well. The treatment if you find it early. And that's the most important thing.

You know, the best thing I'm saying just before it went back to Cuba was. Which hook did I argue with that? 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. How about a QAM hello? Neil. Yes sir. Neil I got one. It's really chirino. And also I yes. My dad told him. She was born in Cuba. She left at early age. She grew up in the caracass Venezuela. And she was also a misrunner up in the mis Venezuela. The only two good moves she may were a mascot on the Hudson. What's that? She showed him. Yeah. She sure did. And also a terminator too. Right. Now as far as the Palestinian thing, the Clinton in 98 proposed with with a leader visceral and yes of airfot. They can have 98% of the land of both the Gaza strip and the West Bank and after yes of airfot studied, he said no, he's that interesting. So it's not how it happened. SG. No, I was going to love the schools. Nice to hear that. Okay. Don't leverage the school system. Then the went to replace, temperatures measuring and marrow distancing of I'm kind of arrested the story. I'm kind of like Paul Gerrard, you're arrested the story. He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- He's a- Colorado, southwest re- Ha, utto gray under bisa in a dot aboard theured area island of lーー That's why the tower and that island of lーー That's why the tower and that island of the lーー He's probably over so much terror on the island Yeah cuz you're He's in the island but he wasn't surprised Re VII Because, Don't tell me youalthy I will all do respect is that Israel has the right to assassinate this guy, because you can have an organization, but the moment you put that organization into parrot and violence then has to be met with violence. You know the bottom line you are whether the modders or not. So, you're saying that this is going to go on forever, which it will until you know what the hell is. Well, the post-analyment well as long as you've got militant terrorists on both sides, both sides are run by it's going to go on forever. And let me ask you this. Why does it matter to us? Why do you care about it? Because the reason why I care so much about it is because the day that it can fix this problem it will be 2.5 billion dollars less than we can give to Israel. Why don't we just stop giving it now? Why? 2.8. Why don't we round it off the three bridges? That's what I call it all the time. Why don't we end that now? That the best way to solve the problem in the way is to have the power to be defined a real leader a person that is standing in the right position. And closing and having the Israelis do the same thing will be a real good idea too. Okay, I just got through a saying that I mean you tell what it was. This guy coming from, huh? He's a juvenile. I don't care what he is, but I'm what kind of crap is that. The max case your article was spot on is the Britswood. Right on target. I got the solution. I mean the Harold just go and walk away from there walk away from back from from from Iraq. That's his bag there, but all of it. Feluca, all of it. Nazareth Nazarena. Nazareth? His business. Just get that loud while we're still time to get it. But that ain't gonna happen because when you get yourself into a pickle and the public is stupid enough to sit back and watch it and see all these bodies coming back, it's these have all over again. Why I mean why I'm even a while I let him suck me into that. Okay, and get it with argument about the Middle East. Like I said before, it doesn't matter to us. Is there any oil in Israel? No, Palestine? No. No. If we really heard about democracy, we wouldn't be back in one of the most corrupt dictatorships in the whole world and that's the Saudis. Our bed fellows, the Saudis, which we've been doing for a long, long time. This ain't just the boasting, although the Bush family relationship with the Bin Laden, the Saudi World family certainly does raise some a lot of questions, which is not enough people are asking. Tell me the QA and the hello, not there. See that guy just, I was in a pretty good mood. I thought that was a good article by Max Castro. And the main thrust of it was not to open up the old argument again about the Israelis and the Palestinians and Yasser Arafat and Ariel Surron. But again about the Harold and the kind of pandering they do in the kind of ragged is, which he's right. It's a ragged that pandering. You won't get any news in the Harold. I'll just get his propaganda. Garbage. And then come election day. You can bet your life on it. Just like they went to a gym bush this last time. I got reelected governor. How that happened? I still am. My head is swimming from that. If that's what the people of Florida want, a governor who lies to them, who's overheard talking about, you know, every time Kerry makes some kind of a comment off like, oh my gosh, it's a big deal that he know the microphone was still on. And it's stuff about nothing like about what about you backstabbing dirty across the Republicans are a big deal. Like that's that's news. But here your governor makes a comment about, I've got some what was the word he used for his plans? Some devious plans? Some devious plans to take care of that class size amendment. On a problem, we love you, Javi last name is Bush. And we don't know that Dilma pride guy from a mushy public plus. You're right. He's going to raise all our taxes real bad. So we'll vote for you again, okay? And especially we want to thank you for helping to fix that election back in 2000 when most of us voted for Al Gore. How is this possible that these people are getting away with this crap unless, of course, just maybe those die-billed election machines were like the voting machines were all, you know, spit nuts among numbers there. How could this man possibly get reelected dog catcher? See this guy got me way, of course. Killed for time though. And a Harold always be a counter-accounted on to do the wrong thing. These are the same people long before the current regime was in there. The same people that gave you the propaganda with a metro rail. The multi-billion dollar boom-doggle, the train to nowhere, that almost none of you ever ride, how many times you ridden it? Oh, I would just got off it. Go to work. Yeah. Josh, how many times you made it on the metro rail? About 30? Yeah. None. Same numbers I win. None. But I'll tell you if you want to go out to Hailea and see what a tour of the third place has become. You can go out there and eat the hang out. Yeah. Or to shorties. You might get some good Bobby Q and head on to Shorty's. You can eat it all the way back. We must, the politicians must like Shorty so much. It's the only restaurant in the history of the human race that had a whole real system. Real system built just a transport people to their door. Man, I wish I could get a deal like that. Those ribs sure are good. Even Ronnie Regan said that it would have been cheaper to buy every driver in South Florida, a new Cadillac to build a metro rail. Even he said that. Yeah, what would my Cadillac? Yeah. I'll take a new elder rato and a new Duke and a new, how do you like that? That's back before all the Jews moved to Voka. But no, it had to be a Harold put it over on us. And then they got to go all the huts but to come back a few years later. And with a big traffic magazine front page story about the metro rail called White elephant. Man, oh man, they had no shame at all. They jam it down your throat. They lie like crazy. My god kind of crap is that two grotesque newspapers who do nothing for the community. That's what we got. Then they did the big exposity and the corruption to hear. For wars, there was a follow up. Where's the beef? What now? Last time I checked. Mayor of San Juan, I said. Alex Penelis was a filmmaker of the county. Last time I checked Mayor. Can you OK? Can't say. Yeah, I like to. No matter what, no matter how many greasy deals go on behind the scene. Including the one with his good buddy Mickey Eris and there with the grease ball arena. Pick it up. What a joke that is. We're going to get selected on a pledge that he's not going to make any sweet art deals with any rich owners to build any. Or he does not. The first thing he knows is that a closed door session would make he Eris and slugs the Mickey of the voters in the county. Psych. Yeah. Surprise. Or he's a Democrat, by the way. Oh yeah. He's an Democrat who did squat the rally going to hold it for George Bush. Some Democrat. What am I going to work to? That's what's here. If I said one call or spot that is really the apologist. Man, he's probably like wiping himself off of the sports section from the hero right now. I don't want to say it. I can't use your own imagination. 1156. Four minutes still known. I give it a five log just stalled around here. Is that a one putting more new names on here anyway? And by the way, pal, will we treat all my ass? Which of these people best?

They call me Mr. Boots and I live isn't it? Who did we all to want an hour? What's going on? We're doing tonight. And crying minds, what's in there? That's why, and firing minds, read the Miami Hero. Is Maurice for a really having sex with an alien from outer space? It's in the house. The house is Paul Hawkins, the true mother of the elephant man. It's in the house.

And we're so sorry Uncle Albert, but we haven't heard of bloody thing all day. Mindle, family, rhetoric. A power and the latest, it's love. So Miami Hero, available at supermarket checkout counters everywhere. And we're a fighter manure is spread. Yeah, you can smell it all the way up here. Yeah, we both should apologize to ourselves because we, well, at least I'm sorry. Because I promise myself, I'm never going to get any of those discussions again about the Middle East because it's a hopeless case. We shouldn't be there in the first place. We should just say, we're cutting off the spig and and the freeway. And no more money if you want to kill yourself a good time. That's that's it. That's my attitude. But I read the article not because I wanted to argue the is really a palacinian thing because of what is called journalism. And I read that term loosely in regard to the Harold. Regardless of what your position or feelings are on that issue if you have any. The point being that a responsible newspaper should have all viewpoints. Just like for example, Toronto star. Now, of course, there are a lot of Middle Eastern people of here in Toronto. And so naturally they get, you know, they would get really holy hell if they didn't. I don't think they need to be forced to global mail the Toronto star. You'll find articles on all sides of these issues every day. Every single day balanced. Is that what you're saying? How do you like that? Well, you won't find fair and balanced in the in the Toronto Sun or the. Well, what's the other one? National post to right wing ranks. Although nevertheless, you'll they have both columnist that they have the opposite point of view. They have to people wouldn't buy them. But of course, in South Florida, we've got four daily newspapers here. They have a choice in South Florida. If you live in day, you got the Harold. If you live in Brarty got the Sun Sentinel. If you live in Palm Beach, maybe you get the Sun Sentinel if you really disparate or Palm Beach post. Well, forget about that. Even the fish won't get wrapped in that. They jump right up. It's right. That was my point. And we've both got led down to Garden Path by this professional. Zionist apologists. Whatever is real does is right. You don't even know what he's talking about. But but aside from that, there can be no debating that the Harold doesn't give any firm balance coverage. Whatever the issue is, that's what they're. And at least this consistent through all different changes and publishers. They've come and gone and it doesn't make any difference. They've just become more stride and more right wing and more apologetic. That's all. Just more extreme. Anyway. So here's the, huh? How you doing? I'm doing great. I'm just waiting till 11. 11. We're just killing time. And we already killed off two hours magnificently. We've butchered it. Which of these people best fit the description? To black. We took care of the Jews and the Gays and the Cubans. Leave them alone, please. They've had enough creep. We've had enough creep from them. Which of these people best fits the description to black? I only came up with a couple. Johnny Cochran. Oh, I got another one. I got two more. It's not a two more. Johnny Cochran, O.J. Simpson. Louis Veracan. Thought you took a bite. And Jesse Jackson. Professional black. What about I'll sharpen it? I'll sharpen. He's probably too black for some. CBC is caught now by the way. Did you see that? No, I did not. CBC is caught in Al Sharpen. What about his name is for a TV show? He's also been quoted by Premier in the couple other radio networks for a Synthicated radio show. I underlined Synthicated radio show. Al Sharpen. He was good. Got ahead of to me. I did good all was debates. You said it first and then I will walk. He and Dennis Cassinins said the right things. They performed the best. They had a sense of humor. They were strong in their positions. They didn't waffle. They didn't equivocate. And they had got squat. And nobody voted for either one of them. Cause I hit that here. Is that what it was? Well, they were right. They both got real bad. They do. Real bad do's. Maybe if we'd had just an emotion. Took out theory before the primary started. Just maybe. But I doubt it. Cause I'm sure that John Kerry didn't get elected on his look. I'm for sure. Oh, man. 5.670560. Palm 560. I'm sure you can see all the AT&T line. I'm sure we'll have no shortage of this because it's just the way it is. We have all these petted juices. Thank God that I have none. You know what I'm saying? WCWM. Hello. Yes sir. I got a brother for your pull. All right. About neon, neon standards. Perfect man. In fact, I was thinking about that. What I made up to pull and I forgot all about it. They got all the balance. They're all right. Yep. I got it. Okay. He was going to find. And then he had a screw up. You know, he could screw up a web dream. Can I say that? No. He could screw up a dream. How could he do that? I just can't control him. So if you finally actually had something to contribute something to say. And he still got to like take his pants down. Show his ass to the world. Hi, Ali. More important than anything else. I see. Well, that's always the purpose of his call. If it's called. So we got anyway. We got Dion Sanders on there. I'm sure.

Like that the busy, blue aren't as is. Whatever that thing was with a four season. He's Google that. He's easy. Topded. Yeah, you Google it. The only problem is with Google. If you put it in a misfiling, it'll say, oh, yeah. We got a whole bunch of those too. And however you spot. See, the deal being later want you to feel too stupid. See. Oh, then that's what it is because I've done the same thing. We've argued about things that I put it the same thing. I said, I did a search on it and it came up. It spelled the way I spelled it. And that's because the internet wants you to feel like, you know, smart like Fredo, that dumb smart. Not like people say. Right. Like Josh. Don't you QA and hello. Hello. How are you? Pretty good.

Always pick it on the Cuban. He's picking on the juice. We're just having a little bit of fun. Go blind. Yeah. I've had that. We don't have it so much lately because over the years. I've kind of like, you know, the people that are all that up tight. I chased them away. Thank goodness. Thank the Lord. Good. Right. I don't want to be dealing with those people. If you have no sense of humor, if you're all up tight, if you're a professional ethic and are looking to be offended well, guess what? Get lost. Find, find something. Okay. Of course, if you're looking to be offended, we'll hook you up. Well, and yeah, that's probably why you're still listening. If you're looking to be offended. We'll hook you up. Right. He is the best. He really. I'm not talking about the real moment. But, the book of Brian's Mo. If we could somehow more hint into the body of the other one, we really have something. Like an audience. WDQAM Hello.

And then they'll be maybe there's going to be some progress. Then maybe we'll take a look again. But we're not going to hold our breath for that.

In fact, what about the deon Sanders? Oh, that's right. He's in first place. See, that's the other thing. Namaste a bunch of black folks and also read us back to the name of some of the people that are already on there. That'll help us kill some really good time to get out here into a clock for the, and let's see, we don't even get the schedule out today. Shame on me. Well, that's because I'm pissed off about it. Because those freaky marlins, who lost 13 to 10 last night of wild game in Colorado, typical Colorado game in that ballpark. But anyway, they got an afternoon game, but they're playing out there. So, of course, the time difference, they started 305 as opposed to like 105, they would have, see? No, so we got Curtis Stevenson, 2 to 230, because big shots like the Mad Dog and you're truly in the Humper. Oh, right. We don't come in for like a half an hour. We just bring in some, you know, I mean, Curtis is fine. He'll do a good half hour for you. Marlins on deck at 230. Marlins at the Rock East, 205, try to come back after last night after a wild wild golf. We got the big at 6 till 10, 4 hours of that. Well, that's how fresh readings. And any K after of that. Why am I picking on him so much lately? I don't know. He just, just something not there is in, I don't know. That must be it. That must be it. Alaino Alsecury sounds pretty Jewish to me. And I'll tell you what no matter what you are, if your carpets are smoked, you don't make any difference. Even if you don't understand what the word smuds means, you know what it's at. You know, if you're a carpets smell bad, they look kind of grimy, dogs, the kids, everybody's done a job on him. Here's the answer. Call my good friends to drive concepts like I've been doing for over 20 years in several different homes. And every single time I use them, I even no matter how much I know they're going to do a super job, I always just kind of look around and say, holy crap, how could they do this? On my floor. Kind of like when I had the dogs, I used to say the same thing. Holy crap, how could they do this? My floor, which is why I needed drive concepts a lot. Once a year should do the job, you're using their train technicians who'll drive clean your carpets like you'd ride clean your clothing to leave them looking brand new smelling lemony first, they're driving a couple of hours so you really can't clean today entertained the night. And it'll give you a written guaranteed price up front, whether it's your carpeting, your area of rugs, your oriental rugs, your draper, your furniture, poultry, all of these things. All of these things. They do the same stupidest job and no reports or bad surprises at the end of the job. Call to the NCI you can say 15% on the next carpet cleaning too, just by asking them to put you on their stand by list. That'll save you next to your 15% off the already unbeatable price of that stupidest job. After our concepts today, they'll never let you down. 1-800-248-5071.

He only got four vote. Which of these people best described fits in the script of being too black? The on set is 22. I want to change my vote for Dion. What was I thinking about? I think he's one of the very few people when I see them on my TV screen. I just get physically ill. Would have timp out for these got on, you know, and all the jewelry and just, I mean, where's that yellow civilians? What I'd like to know, because he had that in the parking lot somewhere. It's in the garage. I feel black out. You're lucky is because he's only on, run a football game. ZNFL today and yesterday next week and we have a look at this. Yeah, he has a program out on my TV. All of these. All of these straight. Right. And, in fact, you also don't get to see Terry Bradshaw, which means you'll live a lot longer. Do you understand there's 22 Louis Furicon 17, yet? I got a good poll for tomorrow. Yeah. Do these people best fit to the description? Redneck. Right. I always think of that. Will my one to say it for the closer? I thought we'd get to it eventually. Well, we will tomorrow. Well, see tomorrow. That'll be like a little window dressing for when the wedding's so much lemon 30. And then we can like, huh? Right. I'm just going to read the numbers for big one-on-six because that's going to be so cataclysmic. It's going to be, that's not a prediction. That's a fact. And anybody who wasn't listening yesterday, I read it a how many times. But, third man. She to stay the story was the San Francisco of the San Diego. FM station, it carried the Howard Stern Show before course. Chief channel sold out. They told it sold their devil to Michael Powell and the FCC. They had an eight in February that an 8.9 share. This is the book just came out and said they had the month by month. February 8.9 in March after Stern went off on that station. They had a 0.7, 8.9 to a 0.7, just it's almost like somebody tore the tower down. You know what I mean? And they got a few residual diaries from people that didn't know they were off the year. It's almost that bad. And I predict big one or six can duplicate that easily. Absolutely. When those numbers come out tomorrow. Anyway. Oh, this is a story that's just nauseating. And you're like a lot. You want me to go. Why? Because they were putting your least favorite people. Her name is Boba. Oh, Boba. Television in the past few years has given us reality shows in which average men and women battle for a boy, friend of girlfriend, a job of Donald Trump, or a million dollar ticket off of deserted island. Now the industry is taking the genre to a new level. According to recent promotional ads and releases, in episode the ABC News magazine showed 2020 airing 10 p.m. this Friday. We'll feature five couples competing and vying to adopt a baby boy. The host of the program is one of the most prominent broadcasters, Barbara Walba. Walba is upcoming shows around seeing anger among adoption workers across the country. We'll find the depiction of families competing for and winning a baby tasteless. Adoption is not a competition. What if the baby is a baby? A baby is not a prize to be won. ABC is exploiting his child and a whole idea of adoption on national television. I'm disgusted to a gene true to a date by President of the Florida Adoption Council. We're not happy about it, Senator Mary and Shera of adoption placement in a plantation agency. Shera and other adoption professionals all across the country have been writing and calling ABC. Voicing their displeasure over the program's game show like nature and asking please don't air it. The program's website has been flooded in recent days with angry chat room postings. Probably calls to chat shows too. From adoptive parents, birthmothers and others among the messages, you will win the award for the best trash on TV if you're the show. And I'm really surprised at Boba. Talk to you with a journalist. Little did we know. But the total sellout, right? How are they going to be competing the parents? We're just letting you finish the fight. Some writers are urging viewers to complain that the FCC, we're calling for board cuts of Disney. The parent company of ABC and Comcasts know we don't want to buy any more by the way. Disney. In response to the outcry ABC pulled its promotional item, we placed it with a version that does not portray the process as a competition or reality show. ABC news rise President Jeffrey Schneider would not discuss the contents of the show, which will air during the start of a rating switch for it, just by coincidence I'm sure. But said we view copies that included references to the options of the competition do not reflect final editing changes. It is a very responsible, interesting thoughtful hour and a process most Americans might not know anything about he said. The apperers over B. My Baby, the Friday episode that had been built as a unique look inside the intense competition of the open adoption process. The hour-long show focuses on Jessica, 16 year old pregnant old high-o-girl, and her struggle to select one of five couples to adopt her unborn son. The mother to be watched a couple who will permit her and her standard family to continue to play a prominent role in the boy's life. Sinking to adopt a child who I'd yet to be born at the time of taping, Karen and Tab Brown, mortgage broker and sales exec, Steven Kathy Follinger, police officer in a administrative assistant, teachers Tina and Daniel McKeen, financial administrator Steven Joyce Strasser, and Beth and Matt Trinka, where how supervisor and physical therapist, the show's news releases referred to the couples as fine-list, shadowing them as they each go through a 30 minute interview to convince the pregnant girl that they be the best parents for her soon to be born Baby. At one point Tab Brown says he feels as though he's on the dating show the bachelor, your inner your out-to-night. The adoption professionals through the show would, while perhaps well intention, will leave yours with the inaccurate ideas about the process. Also, birth mothers today do review family profiles and select individuals and couples to raise their children. They do so only after adoption agencies have to careful scrutiny of all parties, narrow the choice to far fewer than five experts say. Have you just read Donald Trump? I say you got the kid. Huh? Oh man. rarely do birth mothers interview five families in the process does not take 30 minutes. They say it involves months of obtaining information, asking for more information and behind the scenes discussions with mothers and adopted families before any meeting occurs. Families who are not chosen sometimes never even know they were under consideration. The process that it shows is unlike anything I've ever seen in real life said at an apartment, well that'll ought to be a TV reality show. By unreal. He's executive director of the New York based Evan B. Donaldson adoption soon. It's much more private normally. Indeed, the camera's presence not to mention Walters cannot be downplayed. Adoption workers wonder did the adoptive parents agreed to participate, thinking that somehow have a better chance of getting a baby? The Jessica Field Pressure really pushed her right to her child because she was appearing on 2020? What effect years later will the show have on the boy and his self image? All of these things. There's a lot of anxiety, a lot of concern that this really degrades the process. Oh perfect for TV if it's degrading. He said that run into your president of American Academy of Adoption attorneys. The focus is all on winning the prize and might as well be a basket of fruit. See they're doing it like that. If they had some obstacle courses, maybe eating bugs, getting naked, then they'd have a net. Oh, that's next prize. And law. This is for Twitter, my 16th. You win, you win, you win, you win, you win. It's day all! If I ever tell, I have five six oh, WQA. On the next tip word, David Milch's version of the old West.

Yeah, who did it? I'm Buffalo Bear, mommy. He said that. Kid Liffy is a fellow bill. If you're our fast on a f***ing draw, I will be fast if I didn't put the lotion in a holster. That is a jerk.

And there are people all know you're open to an Cuban version for 20 years. Right. Like I invented this. There was a, I'm not even there. There was a hostility that exists in that town. It is just so we're always like simmering right out of the surface. Why are we now in any boils over when there's something really important like Aliah or the Latin Grammys or whatever. But it's just always at the simmering point. All you got to do is like somebody just give you the wrong look. Or somebody go to the airport and have some cost to come and maybe a small Cuban guy. That did it for me. WQA and hello. Yes sir. James Brown. James Brown. He's pretty black. Good choice. Always in trouble man. See one thing in common at people on this list.

My always the worst crap I ever had in my life. It was just gruesome. Those were two of the worst. Well, it was just bad soup. You know what I mean? It was just bad stuff. Just. Well, quick. No, I was thinking more like when I saw it. Be a friend. Be fair. And I was. And I made the mistake I ate it. And it was pretty nasty, see? I don't like moths of all soup out of a can.

We want to find out if you ever read the, uh, Metro Fail and how you like the rips and chorities. Pretty stop and think about that. I remember people like Richard Friedman having an nervous having a cow back in the back in the day. And the hero was just pontificating. Oh, this is going to be so great for the community. And it's going to do this. And of course, the only reason they heard cared about is because it went downtown. Anything that went downtown. That's why the beef up that cracking neighborhood that the hero doesn't. And let me ask you this. It's not ever go downtown. I mean, and not any were near it. All that big renovation. We're going to do there. You know right around where the hero is. Has that taken place yet? Well, how you got your base side. Now I'm not talking about base side. Now this was, this was a little bit closer into where the one hero plans is. There you know, or her. And we're going to like renovate. And we're going to be a shopping malls. Now this really fancy fancy fancy and really go sit up. And everybody's going to be slacking running down to be in downtown Miami. And increase the value of the hero of the property. Of course, I think there's a new fake Rolex watch stand that wasn't. See that that's just an ancillary benefit. The fact that it would benefit the hero and go stuff there probably. They would never allow that to interfere with their with their editorial job. WQAM. Hello. QAM. You know what I got your winner here? Yes, sir. Michael Irvie. Michael Irvin. Okay. Thank you.

Secret Service agents question a high school student about anti-war drawings he did for our class. One of which depicted President Bush's head on a stick. Another Pennsylvania drawing portrayed Bush as a devalancing a missile with a caption reading and the war on terrorism. The 15 year old boys are teacher at Prasser High School turned the drawings over to school administrators who notified police who called a secret service. We involved the police anytime we have a concern. We're going to discuss the process of superintendent Ray talk catcher told the Tri-City hero news paper. Secret Service agents, I thought that's where you threw your money when you go on the turnpack in the toll catcher. Secret Service agents interviewed the boy last Friday. The student was not arrested. It's not been identified. The school district discipline. But district officials refused to say what the punishment was. Tol catcher said the boy was not suspended. The artwork apparently was part of an assignment to keep a notebook of drawings of where the Kevin Cravens are friend of the boy's family. The drawing that do the most note is show to man and what appeared to be Middle Eastern style clothing holding a rifle. It was also holding a stick when the oversized head of the president on it. The student said the head was enlarged because it was intended to be an effigy Craven said the caption called for an end to the war in Iraq. A message left by the AP with an, what is it? Whatever was not returned. If the scripting you were a kid in Prasser's perceived as a threat to the president that we're living in 1984 Craven said, the president was not a freedom of speech issue but a concert over the depictions of violence. From when I saw school officials right to be concerned, Prasser pulled a Steve wind tailor be saying the relation to Frank Taylor only had one thumb. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

I'd rather have a spastic call in the minute and maybe the week. But yeah, it's something for it. You sure as hell can't call him being too black can you? Nope. Just too full of crap, I think. We probably have a pull on that one these days. So much of these people you think is too full of crap. I don't whom I'd win. Absolutely. Wait till you hear this, speaking of full of crap. Twenty-seven-year-old handcuffed and jailed for unpaid traffic ticket. They went through that again. Highland Park Texas. But as you love around in people up in Texas, you know? They all round up. They don't mess around. They like to smoke them out of their holes and go get them. Police say they had no choice but to go by the book when they handcuffed the ninety-seven-year-old woman. And took her to jail for failing to pay a traffic ticket. Harriet Colton was arrested last week after officer doctor for having an expired registration and inspection sticker, and realized there was a warrant for her arrest for failing to pay a traffic ticket. Colton, a former school teacher, was lived in the Dallas suburb for decades, was in police custody for about two hours before her attorney arrived, and she was released in her own reconnaissance. Our real beef, for this is that no real judgment would display to actually carry down the incident, said Colton's son, Dr. Phil Colton Jr., a plastic reconstructive surgeon with Bayley University Medical Center. But police spokesman, Detective Randy Miller, can say the officers had no choice but to arrest Colton's mother, a warrant begins with awards, you are hereby committed to arrest, Miller, can say, how do you decide who you are arrested and who you don't, how about an age 90, but not an 91 and up, how about between 17 and 20? Phil Colton Jr., said his mother, and other words, maybe a little bit of judgment could come and play on Ohno, they haven't got that book. Can't complain about their judgment because they don't have any. Colton Jr., said his mother lives alone, cooks her own meals, goes out to lunch regularly and is involved with the communities she's got good eyesight. All of our enthusiasm should be tempered with judgment and they're in lies with my problem with this, and basically mothers problem with it too, he said. Her mother son David is a state-district judge who said it would be inappropriate from to discuss the arrest. 97 year old woman, man, which I think 90's old enough, but nevertheless she made it to 97. Out there, driving around she's got good eyesight and sure her reflexes are great. Nobody's asking why 97 year old woman is driving. I mean, she's got a few little pimples on her record there, but nevertheless, if you don't deny it, you probably have a few pimples on it too. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon, wireless line, which of these people best pits the description to black.

You got it. Alright, thank you a lot. He kills me at Don King and other people is what we hear. It's amazing this kind of thing that goes on about people who are like alleged murderers, and that's a late 50 cent in Don King. And they just kind of walk around on the loose like, hey, I'm a big shot. You see? Oh, Jay. Oh, Jay, forget about that. Thank God they didn't play the racecard of that trial. Speaking of trials, what's going on with Jason Williams? Huh? The jury was deliberate yesterday. Let's take a quick look at Quarty V. It seems that they're trying to find out if specifically he tampered with Chris Morris or John Gordonick. They had to answer guilty already to the tampering with witness question. That's me. Now they got a jury clock on here. I Quarty V. But it's not moving. Seven hours, 54 minutes and 27 seconds. What does that mean? Is that how long they've been to the written? Maybe it's jury rigged. No, no, seriously. It's got to be longer than that. Come with. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, but I'm a same old crap man. Just killing time just to let a bunch of time like we are today. At least we got to go to see us. I guarantee that their numbers are coming out tomorrow. Quarty V. What a pretty good though when I got to Jason Williams things on. When you think I think.

Yeah. But she kind of like spreads it all around. I don't know. I just can't stomach her. She just makes me go. I feel I feel like unclean when I see her on my set. Although much worse when Dr. Phillip pops up. See at least at least, even though her showed blows and she's got nothing to say. Uh, at least she accomplished something on her own. She didn't have to be like a, like a spin off from somebody else. Nobody popped her up. I mean, unlike like the Jefferson's, which is a great show. Very, very funny and sputtle with tongue and jica things. Uh, without all in the family, there wouldn't have been no jepers in. Right. And without, uh, Oprah, there would have been no Dr. Phillip.

The Centers for Disease Control has been helping Las Vegas deal with an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness. Too bad we can't play those other sound. I'm playing some of that. Gastrointestinal illness is the pain of the cruise industry and of course anybody goes on a cruise. They deserve whatever they get. Josh, you ever go on a cruise? No. Don't. George, they'll talk about those gambling cruises to know where for whatever they are. Or something like that. Yeah. Don't. Okay. Gastrointestinal illnesses of structural Las Vegas gambling district. One casino hotel received 1660 complaints of such illnesses between December and last week. And outbreak that drove the attention the Centers for Disease Control. The California hotel casino where get and every word heard of it. Gaston Gamers became ill was asked to sanitize diced twice per eight hour shift and chips and coins at least once a week. So David Tonelli spokesman for Nevada Clark County Health District. These hotel systems are where you were two years ago. David for any chief of the Centers for Disease Controls. Vessel sanitation program told the annual meeting of cruise industry executives today at Port Everglades. A lot of people are learning what you did two years ago. CDC officials have been helping Vegas deal with the outbreak in local health department or specific meeting soon with casino hotel representatives to discuss public health concerns. Over the past few years, cruise lines have reported to the CDC several thousand cases of gastrointestinal illnesses including the Norwalk virus or Norow virus aboard chips, followed from the outbreaks as well as from the war in Iraq put a considerable dent in the now recovering travel business. Las Vegas health officials noted that not all of the 1660 complaints of gastrointestinal illness at the California hotel casino were confirmed as Norow virus. The outbreak in the hotel casino blocked from the Vegas to reach the peak in March and appears to be on the wane. Well that's a good news. It's waning in Vegas which nobody cares because they're all going to stay inside anyway which is what they want. They don't want you to go outside. They don't want you ever to leave. They want to get you an air like locked the doors from the inside from the outside. Keep your locked ass locked in. And that basically what they want? Yes. It's fun. It's a lot of fun.

Gonna have a wonderful time. Losers asked. And that'll be it. But he'll come back all smiles here to your oil. It was great. And he's right. It's a lot of fun. I'd rather take somebody else's money and lose it. But you know get very badly. Okay. So here's the time. I'm not going to get married. I'm not going to Vegas again. And if I lose anybody's money, how about Greg Reed? A couple of many won't be good. Small but it's small change to him. Look at that race. We got Lewis Ferrican 61. Dion Sanders 56. L sharp in 48.

It's the greatest country in the world. They train us to Louis. And anyone who says that obviously and before to be. And I'm embarrassed to be in America where we take three hours of heat. We have a flag and would ask with our hand in the sand. And blindly follow the powers that we have a set take. Watch the stage for news on the 65 inch screen. Scratcher five everything's okay. Anyhow, we got a minute to go ahead and we got current Stevenson for half hour than a Marlins man in Colorado. Then a wild series, a lot of run scoring. 13 to 10 a last last night Delbans back today am I right or what? Yeah, I was really whipped up a butter right. But you talk about Marlins man Marlins that stuff. I'll speak it of wrapping up the flag and stuff like that. For many Iraqis, it was the final insult again and again. They expressed outrage yesterday that Iraq's US appointed an unlected leaders at overnight abolished the older Iraqi flags seen by most of Iraqis as the symbol of their nation and chosen a new one. A new and creative way to piss off the Iraqis. Aren't we doing a hell of a job? We're liberating it. What gives these people a right to throw away our flag to change a symbol of Iraq, asked Salah, building contractor, normally moderate public political opinions. It makes me very angry because these people are putted by the Americans. I will not regard the new flag as representing me but only traders and collaborators. And as a team and I do like the mashed haters. Anyway, let's see, the pull is tight man. Get on a hop on that pull and vote today. We got to really five way you're raised. It's going somewhere. Tomorrow 11 30 tomorrow. Man, get your, uh, protects all puckered up. It's going to be a hell burner. Bye bye. I'm a man, man, man, man, man, man. Manny Ramirez.
