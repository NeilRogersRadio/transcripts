Oh speaking yes Hey Neil, I do on a day pretty good so far I have a question about this 9 or 11 thing that's going on well went on I heard that on the morning of September 11th George Bush's brother was having breakfast with those some have been loud and brother is that true?

I start to catch on welcome to America all right man good old old young often pali two three times at least Oh for anybody but boy Oh baby ABB man anybody but boys Anybody okay good call Okay, here's the poll today and this I was inspired by this whole male Gibson thing boy I got a great story about male Gibson and about his daddy and all kinds of good stuff He makes me want to puke and I thought of that for a long time, but you're just I don't know you know I'm a Gibson personal. I love that You know Oh, I don't care if he made any good movies. I wouldn't watch it if you heard me by the second He makes my skin crawl Mel Gibson. He's an anxious piece of turd But anyway, you're even there still a bit here's the question what's your take on a religious right and I realize again Just like when we did a few days ago, there's a lot of slopp over here But maybe it's mostly just to let some of us vent including me. I'm so sick and tear this whole goddamn thing. Oh there he goes again We've got to find out if I can say that you know and when we get to the infinity thing you'll find out one thing Wow, well we already knew that but boy, it's getting really scary And you want to know why and of course all this Clamping down allegedly because of one movie on TV the Super Bowl, booby What's your take on a religious right you got two four six seven choices? They're nothing but hate-mongering morons I don't mind if they leave me alone They're the biggest purverts of all. I'm one of them praise God the whole religion thing is a big racket They're full of Shiite or they gave their brains away to fakers and For some reason I wrote Nicole Egard on the bottom here was this because I don't want anybody to miss out She's been on the podium today. Yeah, I apologize personally No, you people in the audience should apologize personally for not putting her on there because I just came across that movie last night I was it with the Corey Ham and Corey Goldman and the co-legger don't be knocking Corey Ham, okay. He's cute He just turned 55 but he still has QC's got Robbie Vincent syndrome whatever But anyway, there's a scene in there where they're actually doing it start naked. I mean there just bang in their brains out What the hell's the name of that move? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's it. Blow something up. Don't say that now watch yourself Don't you like anybody in the audience if you ever cut yourself? We're gonna make everything out radio so antiseptic then Instead of we're getting some of that schmere on stuff. How do you got to do is put your arm up against or your knee or whatever against the radio And it'll heal immediately.

Like the power one is over where the food gets. Drought the bow by the Galilee, D.C. He don't want you to ever see that. All you do want to think of is a wrap. And a qualified story of a busy rat. After King as he gets from his old man. That you tell you where the hell is. And then you lose your cold. And rather, you lose your shame. It goes to lies and play the usk. And so goes from new to new to that day. You're going to do it to you, queen. Like the power one is over where the food gets. And let me find the meat that we showed that. He had the mind of a five-year old man. By the name of the children, let me say it's so bad. He's a grand record real kid alone now. And to the job that he got from his death. We got a more-in-is-death C.C. And we don't want you to see a new to T. That your old was worth a day, a day of home as a problem in with this. I don't want the baby to sit down, kid.

I'm just gonna see that like to grand dance. I can tell I wanna know where the food gets. I can tell I wanna know where the food gets. Maybe we can feature Michael Paul naked on our website one day. That would really be of scene. 1017 at 5.60WDC, although he probably never is completely new. Even in the shower, he probably wears like some kind of a smoth or something more than it. Exactly, he's got that magic underwear. B.C. J. Viacom, president Malk Carmason, read the Riot Act. Executives of all 180 Infinity radio stations yesterday, including Howard Stearns in New York Tongue and they'll be fired. If they violate the company's new zero tolerance policy on obscenity. Don't screw up. See even that, don't be using language like that, Mal. Nope. Don't mess up, Carmason. See, oh brother, what did I tell you? We're taking these gigantic steps back into the Stone Age, man. It's pathetic. You want four more years of this man. By the end of another four years, you won't have any freedoms. Forget about the first amendment, forget about the Constitution, even straight people won't be able to get married. Infinity is home to Stearn and several other controversial videos shows that have been canceled, find or suspended for sexual hijinks, including Opian Anthony after the infamous sex and St. Pat's contest. Oh, what a terrible thing. Last evening after the conference call in Infinity executive's issue, a blunt memo to all personnel. The memo said, any station airing programming that has any sexual or expratory content needs to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that the programming is not even arguably in decent. Let me read that sentence again. Yeah. Let me argue about it. I mean, the whole thing is so subjective anyway. The whole, what they do is they put up a bunch of vague regulations and they just wait to trap you. Gotcha. Gotcha. You said crap. That's obscene. Right. Based on what we just decided that it's just, they just make it up as they go along. They said that. The best thing was back at IOD. Remember, it was before your time. I think when we got fine for the, oh, it was just a few days. Part time or there at the time. Yeah. We got fine for about three or four different comedy boots. Yes. Very innocuous ones. And when the ruling came back from the FCC, they wanted to make sure that the message was passed along to me. The favorite one was sex in a morning or whatever was. Boys, that was the one they liked the best, but we weren't supposed to play it. So they enjoyed it very much. It was okay for them to hear it, but we sure couldn't play it on a radio. What wouldn't that cute? Yeah. And then of course, a cute way in that foul mouth, dolphin, Brian Cox thing that we played. We got fine for that again, even after the first time at IOD, the FCC said, oh, that's okay. Because all the bleeps are in it. See? We got further that here. It was okay there. Right. That's what I said. That's what I just said. It was okay at IOD, but then we got fine for it at QAM. So they didn't even let you know what it ended. Of course, when you say them well, how about if we send them a Trial 2 with some screening committee first before we've aired on, oh, that would be prior restraint. We can't do that. We want to let you make a mistake first and then we'll say, Gotcha. And of course, they just want to find it. Anyway, the memo said, any stationary programming that has any sexual or extra-tory content needs to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that the programming is not even arguably indecent. When in doubt, leave it out. So the memo, which also ordered all stations to install programming delay units for on the fly censoring immediately, them little yellow buttons like we got. When it doubt leave it out. Yeah, it's good reason they're yellow too. That's right. I think there's an omen there. Stations were told to seek advanced consultation with counsel if they have questions about anything graphic or explicit. The strict new policy would appear to put the Kibash on several regular features of Howard Stern's show, who wasn't mentioning yesterday whose on vacation this week, including small penis contest and bits were in items are placed in a expelled from, Bracdom to most intimate parts of a bodily areas, which we don't want to say which ones they are. Bracdom in this story got for bit. Because we're a pro more back to want to piss off anybody, even though the FCC has no controller uh, newsprint yet. Carme is on war in 180 infinity program directors, including those at New York's K Rock, Mix 102.7 WFAN WFAN WCBSAM and Wins, Wins 1010 New York, that the FCC is looking to make examples of wrongdoers or not that far from evildoers. It's exactly what you expect us to see under fire to say, so the conference call participant. So there you go. That's the latest on the FCC and Michael Paul's history and the reaction to it. Everybody is like quivering and shaking and quaking in their boots. Let me just, let me just play a one last time probably. There you go. How about one more? Okay. I think that's about it. That may be the last time we can ever say that on New York, you're sure and certainly on a measly broadcasting. These people have got the backbone of a jellyfish. We can't say that one more time. Probably right now Greg is having a gigantic moving experience. Just thinking about this, right? Right. So whatever you do when you're on filling for me, don't say that. I won't say anything. And you can still take a, right, sure. Well, that depends on how smelly it is. It smells real bad. If it smells real bad, that might offend somebody commissioners and certainly Michael Paul will be offended by smelly BM. So don't do that either. If you do, in fact, if you do take one, be sure to take your, like, some kind of cashmoboker or some kind of spray that glade your freshener in there with you. But always, here's a good, at message for all you kids out there. If you want to be safe, always take a can into the can. I'll take a scented candle. Take a scented can into the can and be sure and spritz it and spray it around real good after you do your duty. I got you. I got you. Wow. So that's the crap. Lesson for today. Don't be just saying that. Okay. What do we got on the pool so far? It's just, I'm telling you, it's just, it would be funny for words so pathetic and embarrassing and humiliating. You know, we made a little bit of progress. We came along. They started using a few words. We don't have to say water closet. They can talk about toilet paper on TV. Hey, now we got hemorrhag commercials. All of these things, you know, that's commode paper to you. And you keep talking about diarrhea. You know, have to whisper a little bit. But now everything we have to turn a clock back because a bunch of right wing for radical religious lunatics who take an over your company stole the election. See, that was okay. That's honest. Hmm. They stole it for Jesus. Well, 95 votes. What's your take on a religious right? The whole religion thing is a big racket. And you're how many voted that? I've heard of man. That's really so far. There's nothing bug a bunch of hate-mongering morons 25. I don't mind if they leave me alone. Well, which they won't. In fact, this passion is Christ thing. I would've known Gibson. They're going to be putting little things on your door. They're going to be putting little thing on your door knob. Yeah. This does that he always puts his little thing on the door knob. I don't mind if they leave me alone 12. They're the biggest purverts of all eight. That was my vote. Putting them priests. They're following the Shiite seven. They gave their brains away to Faker's seven. And I'm one of them praise God. Six of people. Six point three percent so far. We have a half a dozen. Jesus, uh, Freaks in the audience. God bless them for Jesus Christ. God bless you, man. Oh god. That's right. I'll pray for you. I'll pray for your brain to wake up one day. Okay. I'll sacrifice a chicken. Just like these people at Centus amazing facts from Peter. Oh boy. I'm getting in with that. Ah. And of course speaking of those right wingers, they're going to be very dismay. Don't think it's probably coming propaganda because the polls change all the time. But this latest USN that they see in Gallup polls shows now that if the election were right now, Kerry beats Bush 55 to 43 by 12 points and even John Edwards, the relatively unknown John Edwards is making a movie very fast. Even he would be Bush today 54 to 44 by 10 points. So ABB anybody would push seems to be making some serious headway. All right. In the USA unless of course you're gay. 26 or maybe especially if you are 26 past 10 and by the way cut out those marriages, the Bush mice, your and the lovely lower are first lady. They're not too happy about that. They're pissed off. Even Barney Faggin happy about it. I'll tell you why. Okay.

I call this press conference to allow me the opportunity to speak out. Not with regard to legal issues that face Michael Jackson presently. But to lash out at my sister Janet's terrible behavior at last Sunday's Super Bowl. I am as offended as the rest of you. Regarding her book showing activity during half time. I am even more upset that a network, such as sickening display, get on the air. Women are disgusting, especially naked women. People believe that she was actually wearing a pacy when Justin Timberlake tore off her clothing, but this is simply not true. I am here to say, for the very first time on the public airways that my sister Janet Jackson actually has from a telegrite nipple. I am here to say, for the very first time on the public airways that my sister Janet Jackson actually has a metallic right nipple. The fact remains that all of us in the Jackson clan are actually space aliens. We came here to earth to study your species. You are a bold and complex people on this planet. I am very sorry I am not able to address any questions from the press, physically. I have to return to my spaceship with my Wonder Monkey Greek. Thank you very much. Come on, Greek. Come on, Greek. Come on, Greek. Come on, Greek. 1031 and 560W. If there's anybody after I read that infinity memo, anybody wondering why Ferrell got can from Kiyam and it's just one of those deals you can. You cannot be an adult in America and no more. You just can't. No. Everything has to be reduced to the level of like five year old children. So adults have to, you know, their brain has to be reduced to that level. And of course they figure if they knew that real fast and Bush can get in again easy because that's about the level he operates on. Now speaking of the Pita people, wait till you hear this facts. Start out my morning with this. I'll start out my morning with the fact that I couldn't hear George because of the fact that whoever's run on the stuff in your last night because we had two ball games, a hot game in a basketball game at the same time continues diddling with our lives and I had no audio feed. I just mentioned that so that may be tough, might get off his stuff and clearance as well. And get after these people because they keep coming in their plan fast and loose with our equipment of QAM which were seeded over the other diddles with my stuff here. But they were diddles with me either. I figured part of it. I'll hire somebody to go up there and diddle with it. No chance they'll never get in. But we say diddles. Not after today. You can say. Hita. Although it all depends on what you mean by that. See what I mean? In fact, oh no, priest arrested for second time on Kitty porn charges. This is bad. I think you made this up. Yes. Luffy at Luzian, a priest removed from his post in Morgan City because of child porn charges been arrested again. After investigators allegedly found explicit images during assertive is home at a monastery near up up Alusus. I've always wanted to say that, you know, up Alusus. Well, whatever it is, it's Alusian. Patrick Kajawa 35 faces federal charges, a possession of Kitty porn in connection with hundreds of images that are laid in said they found in his computer according to court documents five yesterday. Kajawa already is on probation connection with child porn charges. The love to his removal in 2000 from an associate pastor job at Holy Cross Catholic Church in Morgan City. He is still officially considered a priest with a Catholic dicey of home at Tibdo, Tibdo, but has been taken out of the ministry. I don't know what that is. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. He's being held without bond. I've had a one of us to get a set of search of. Kajawa's computer uncovered 300 digital images and 100 digital movie files of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct. There you go. There's another one here. Good father's okay. Maybe that's why that thing about hypocrites is going to move up on our list, right? Anyway. Getting back to the old listing I already saw about the risk of car crashes rises with age. See, this may come. This is from Tampa the story. It comes great news to people around the rest of the country, but in subfloor we don't need no primer on that. That's right. We know all about that. Now get back to this facts about. Please. From David and Cynthia. I won't use their last name out of respect, although I don't have any for them. It says yesterday I heard you say this spurging remarks about. Peter. People for the ethical treatment of animals. An organization which my husband and I have supported for over two decades, how said. And this coming from me being a great animal over that I am, so don't give me a song to dance about how I'm insensitive and I'm hard to ask any audience about whatever you want. It says. It says. Peter. Simply believe. Now, wait a minute. If I belts like that, isn't that like excretory activity? You're excreting and disputing gas, right? But this one from the throat and not feeling. And yeah, well, that's a sex organ. Oh, that's what does it. You know, that's only this morning that you couldn't get your little finger. Anyway, Peter simply believes as we do it. Gosh, he'll tell you he heard it. He was a fallen on a floor in life because he knows it's not true. Peter simply believes as we do that no animal should be abused or killed for any reason. Like us, they're living beings with varying levels of intelligence and sensitivities. Well, I guess I should feel bad because I had both of my dogs put to sleep. They were on the verge of death and I put them out of the misery. I had to put to sleep and believe you me. There was no chance that they were going to survive. Okay. So call me a bad guy. You're bad guy. Okay. I accept that. I'm sure you have no idea is to the terror and torment of which millions of animals exist. And then it includes all species. Yes, I do. I have a very good idea. Right. What we blindly do to animals would not be permitted to tolerate. In fact, this he's sending this to me. We just raised tens of thousands of dollars for abandoned per rescue for dogs and cats and other animals that have been turned left on their own in the lurch. A no. And he'll give you any lecture about animals. Anyway. What we blindly do to animals would not be permitted to tolerate it on the most evil of humans. Hitler, Domer and that coward Charlie Manson. There'd be a protest by many of our inhumane treatment. Yet our cruelty to non-humans is excused after all their only animals. So let them lose their souls. I wonder if they said that at Hiroshima Nagasaki. They say that about all the people who we've fried? No. Yes. There are literally hundreds of animal rights organizations. Yet when asked a name one or two, most would answer. Peter? No, I wouldn't. If that was asked to name a lunatic fringe animal group, I would say. Peter? Well, some of the rations appear outrageous. Peter? Draws attention to the rights of animals. Granted, sometimes it's over the top. Now since the end of it, we're starting at close to the truth. However, when a volunteer from Peter, throws the carcass of a dead fox in the face of someone wearing fur and shouts. Here's the rest of your coat. Our protest against the practice of evils section on dogs and other animals without benefit vanisthesia or the beaten to death of an orangutan who started an east woods every which way but lose by its trainer or chickens. In fact, we farms having the beaks and faces sliced off all standing in their own equipment and countless other atrocities were with them. Well guess what we're with them too. On some of those, the subject, although I'm not too crazy about having some of their red fox or a dead fox in my place, right, my drill business. When Peter, convinces Burger King and McDonald's, tends to do more humane methods regarding farm animals were with them. When they worked to change laws regarding circus animal abuse were with them. When they pointed they proven to wreck correlation of kids abusing frog, snakes, cat stalks, etc., and adult violence were with them. When they seek the strongest penalty for someone who steals a family pet to use as a bait animal for their fighting dogs were with them. We choose compassion over cruelty, someone has to stand and speak for the animals. Peter does not back down any of the ways in Sirley David and Cynthia. Well there's some good points in there but the fact is the one sentence there, when it's sometimes it's over the top which it kind of glows over that. Let me circle that even I'm going to write. Mid-Kan is momentarily. Yeah you're right. Like both are very often over the top like when they wanted that town to change its name right. What was the name of that town? Slotterville. Slotterville. Slotterville. So we don't like that slaughterville. Yeah. And the other half of you. That they probably if the old baseball player for the Cardinals in Yankees if he was still alive. He was slaughtered. They probably would have wanted him to change his last name. Although he was known as Enis the penis. Now I'm saying that for the very last time because I've heard that. Hey Enis. You call that a penis? And she's saying this for the last time too. I'll guarantee you that right now. So anybody that enjoyed like the Howard Stern show or for a while on the way any of that stuff. Forget about it because that's all past say you're not going to hear it no more because you have a bunch of dictators up there in Washington who sit around now and make everybody crap in their pants. They're just well I said crap against it. Sorry. Making everybody do duty in their pants. No you can't see it. See you're really fine. I know you can't even. Well even a boy's guy say I promise to do my duty to do my best to drive our way across the street whether she wants to go or not. Just make sure you couch it correctly. I see duty on the couch right. WQM hello. Hey, no. Yes sir. So are you a website yesterday. I'm looking at that picture of the more bush. Read my lips. Yeah. Doesn't turn you straight. I don't know what could. Didn't work for me yet. I'm going for you. I'm going for you George. Let me ask you this. What about Nicole Eggard? I have no idea. You don't know who that is? No. I'm going to go for a picture on one of these days. Nicky and then you'll know and then they will fear you man when you know who that is. Okay. All right. Okay. See they liked the and they could picture now. That's on the internet of course. It's a damn good thing we can't show the naked pictures on a round the radio. If we go back and hold those up and you can actually see those images on a radio. Then we'd be in deep trouble. Not a little bit. But duty. I'm showing it in HD digital. Are you ready? And that's right. Because QM work. Daily digital. Baby students see that like every little detail on the nipple. I forget about the booby right on the old nipple. Poor point. Omega pixels. Sure. She didn't do all that great yesterday on our pool. I guess she's old news. But then again there were a lot of people on the other world. News and did very, very well. But you know there's just something they don't like her for whatever reasons. She's a person. You know exactly. So what's wrong with that? Nothing. In fact, I think a lot of people do like a bitch. You know, like to slap her around a little bit. Now, not suggesting that or advocating that. See I have to be. Right. There will. You know, I'm really glad to see that that nice, a young lady, the place kicker for Colorado University. They got raped and then abused by that coaching. I'd like to see that they're interviewing her and they're making a big story about that. Because this is one of the real things that's wrong with America. I don't hear Michael Powell talking about that. But this is one of the real sick things about this whole sports culture and I'm not so the Jack culture. Jack. You like to study Jack. Are they talking about it on our station? I don't know. I'm sure they are. What about it, Josh? Are they talking about the Colorado situation? Yeah, a little bit. And what do they say? That Colorado, you know, it's not just happening on it for an accident. You know, it's got to be going on. It's got to be going on everywhere. That's right. It's going on all over the place. Certainly not the University of Miami though. No. No. They got their own fish to fry. They got their own fish to fry. They gave us show starts the day at two. Oh, no. That's right.

You know, that spot we just played a minute ago that he zoos his spot. Were you paying attention? No, no, of course not. When you should have been, because there's a very familiar voice in there. Okay. Very hauser. Sorry. Well, it's not that I really knew that but I looked it up. He played Oscar in the summer 42. He does commercials now. He was the Chubby ugly kid that was Oscar's, that was a Hermes buddy. Okay, I don't know if they got saw that since 42. You didn't see the summer 42? No. You never saw that movie? I like a hundred years ago when I was a child. You gotta remember Jennifer O'Neill? I know who she is. And who played Hermie? What was his name, Gary Grimes? Anyway, here's a fact that Mr. Results from yesterday's book. Could you please repeat the top five? And where Charlize Theron finished? I don't have it. Do you? No. I should mid-Canad long-term. Marilyn Manson. Charles Manson. Yeah. Shirley Manson. And Hermie and Oscar, I think. Sorry about that. I'll look at the other way, basically. If I can piece it together. And if not, maybe I don't want to bother Eric with that. He's under a lot of stress and de-ress. He's a foaming at the mouth. Jerry, how's your who played Oscar in the summer of 42? I'm pretty amazed. I'm pretty impressed with myself. Although the internet, you see that the Google just added four billion more pages? No. Do you didn't see that? Boy, I tell you, you're just out of the loop, man. You better get back with it. You better step-wring about things like religious nuts and politics and things like that. And about getting laid. Where are you about important things like Google? Ah, Yahoo. I don't Google. You don't Google? Ah, Yahoo. Oh, Jesus. Shame on you. Well, I think that if he used that Alexa bar, I believe that's a Google. I'm going to start. I think it is. No, Google is good search engine. I just thought I would live my life on Yahoo. I think, go if you use that nice Alexa. See, I got George to install at this morning. It takes about 20 seconds. See. And there it is. Alexa, you got a nice bar and even has a link. Well, I don't want to say, there's a one on there. It's a nice cheeky bar. And you could like do emails real fast. So now I can send Eric like 70, 80 news stories every day because, because my email. Because the emailing process is so much easier now. Thanks to Alexa. Anyway, let's get to the account with this off no longer. Okay. Although I might take one quick call. QAM Hello. John, but, fact. I, John by impersonator. Up yours, man. I'll probably get a lot of company. Fierre just before Gibson's the passion opens. And this is something the early daily news. I beg of the fear of you. I'm going to put you around with the 45 degree angle. And you have to say, You're all just standing for these double-pins tracks. I'm sorry, I just like that with a heavy-trim and accent. And then you'll be okay, maybe. Maybe we will check your ancestry first. Fierre just before Gibson's the passion opens. A week before Mel Gibson's movie about Jesus hits theaters. His father has gone on an explosive rant against Jews, claiming they fabricated the Holocaust and are conspiring to take over the world. Jesus Christ. They're after one world religion and one world government. Hutton gives the Navy five. This is Mel Gibson's Daddy. Sit in a radio interview that'll air Monday night. That's why they've attacked the Catholic Church Ostrong. We do ultimately take control over it by their doctrine. Well, all be eating cheese blunts is by the end of the year. And the bizarre interview Gibson also said federal reserve chairman Alan Greenspan should be lynched. And called for the government to be overthrown. The movie stars fathers made outrageous statements about the Holocaust and Jewish conspiracies before. But the timing of his latest comments is certain to fuel the upper over his sons movie and the passion of the Christ which opens on ass Wednesday. Next Wednesday. Some critics say the movie blames Jews with the earth of Christ and will provoke anti-Semitism. And they question why Mel Gibson hasn't denounced his father's views. Hutton gives him spoke Monday to Steve Fierrestein of Speaker Peace on WSNR 620 AM in New York. A show-synicated by Talkline, the largest indicator of Jewish programming. Some of his most outrageous rants focused on the millions of Jews exterminated by Hitler. They claimed there were 6.2 million Jews in Poland before the war. They claimed after the war the only 200,000, therefore he must have killed 6 million of them. He said they simply got up and left. They were all over the Bronx and Brooklyn and Sydney, Australia and Los Angeles. He said the Germans didn't have enough gas to create made 6 million people. All of it took what the people had bear, I think he's wrong. And that the concentration camps were just work camps. It's all maybe not all fiction, but most of it is he said. Gibson repeatedly smeared prominent Jews as money grubbing power monitors. Greenspan tells us what to do is someone should take him out and hang him. He said. He even be little the Pope's recorded endorsement of the passion recounting how Mel refer to the Pontifism as. Well, I was starting to get a little bit warm. Gibson reserved most of his vitriol per Judaism. No asking is the Jews delightively anti-Christian. He is for by being a Jew. He is anti everyone else. Mel Gibson spokesman, Alan Nirob had no comment on the elder Gibson's tie, right? But Abraham Foxman of the anti-difamation league said they were the words of a classical anti-Semite. If it wasn't so sad it would be funny. He's troubled by Mel Gibson's fader to condemn his father's beliefs and pointed out to a recent interview where Mel Gibson said his daddy never lied to him. Well, he's been lying to the world, but it sounds like truth to the sun. That strange Foxman said is in DAH. As in DAH passion of DAH Christ. What is this thing here? If you are Mr. and he coverage of this, please excuse mine up this. The nation madam is exposed to a little must treason and court. And then our website yesterday, Mr. Outraged. I don't understand. It was they keep fencing us stuff on our website. If you go to thearages.com you'll discover that I mean we can't have everything on there. We can't be on top of everything. We appreciate the fact that there is no. And if we already have it, that's fine. We can spit can it. But Jesus Christ. Like we don't know about that article a little bit treason by Matt Pivins. It was on it was the nation yesterday. We had it on our website. Thank you. And you ripped her a big fat film. I can't say yes. I think we can still say, you ripped her to it. I think you have to say bottom. He ripped her a big bottom. There you go. A foggy bottom. So anyway, there's Hutton Gibson who's Mel Gibson's Daddy. Now we get to the real need to the matter on the platter. Don't splatter. Christian pushed behind the passion. This is a great article that was in the Toronto Sun yesterday. Toronto Star yesterday. WQM. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes sir. Thanks for taking my call. I'm glad you talked about Mel Gibson today. I read an interview yesterday by a member of the clergy. He's a private screening. The movie where Mel was there. They asked him why he had all the people in the movie speaking aeromec or laden. And Gibson says that he thought that those languages would be more threatening for the villains. That they was just making them more menacing. So you know, this type of movie. It doesn't have anything to do with him trying to face the story of the story from the Bible. It's just just an angry. He's just trying to make it as salacious and as provocative as possible to stir up the emotions of everybody. Right. That's a lot of good religious hate, which is what religion does best anyway. Absolutely right. Thanks for trying to. Well, we've related this article from the Toronto Starman of the little flip your lid. Richard, the guilty. The suspect is big of a whack at who it is that is. Amen. Have a great day, pal. You too. I'll see you in church. Oh, Gibson read in the Mel Gibson recently embraced the fringe form of Catholicism known even George didn't know this as traditionalism. That I never heard of till I read this article in the Star yesterday of faction that refuses to acknowledge the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in 65, which absolved the Jews for the killing of Christ. Now he not accept that. Traditionalism which means ultra-finatical Catholic is Mel Gibson. Right. Even the Pope is an ass, he said. Which I would agree well, and we can find one area for agreement. Doesn't just growly enough for it. A bottom is what he said. Mel's atop the Pope is a bottom. You just can't wait for a date. He said it'll be great. And then you won't have to, well, Craig can push behind the passion. Don't start that. Listen, I'm telling you right now. Don't play fast and lose with this. I'm better get that. I saved the New York Post thing. Unlike the other stuff I smid can. I think I did. About my eye heard is. In fact, maybe I'll to read you that one sentence again from Mel Carmes in the infinity. Or maybe I'll read you that one sentence again from Mel Carmes in the infinity. But any station in the course, this is not an infinity station. Thank you. Oh, God. They got held a lot more balls than the Beesley's everworld dreamer haven't just that. The Beesley's are. Wouldn't like that. So they have no idea what we're doing. Any station airing programming that is any sexual or ex-retory content needs to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that the programming is not even arguably indecent to memo from Mel Carmes and said to all of you coming. How was managed? Nippet, nippet in the bud. Don't say nips either. All we can see Sharon Stone's nips on our own. He's a person. I think they're exempt or they. No, they're not. No, they used to be. See, that's what Janet Jackson did. The sports guys used to be exempt. They could say whatever they want. But. No. What can they spell rape the female players in the locker room? Yeah, so far that's okay. All right. We haven't had a ruling from her Heinrich Michael Paulian. This is going to take me while it's a long article, but I don't care. Very, very important. Christian pushed behind the passion. This is by Christopher Hutsl. Entertainment writer for the Toronto Star. Jesus told him to be used to convert non-Christians Canadian Jewish leaders. Cauchas expect no troubles. The time, the timeline leading up to the release of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ might be compared to the fuse of a firecracker. Spitting and sparking chasing its own fire retail in a maelstrom of hype. You can only plug its ears and wait for this religious cherry bond or explode. With Gibson's retelling of the last 12 glory hours of Jesus Christ's life-lead Christians weeping, non-believers believing in Jews ready to combat a new wave of descent. Or will it be a dud, destabete reincarnate as a dusty DVD in the church AV room? If this much liberated film does for Israel won't be full like a effort from Canadian Christian lobby groups. For months now several influential international Christian assemblies working under. Jesus crusade for Christ and pursuing a truly calculated strategy for the marketing of this epic film. After all this project wasn't going to be hyped up by conventional means we surely weren't going to see flawed Christ figures on Burger King Cups. That's my logway. Do I have another spot coming? Take this. Oh. What did he say? Oh, with a V. I thought you said something with a D. Don't say it. Don't even think it. Then if you don't think it you won't say it. Okay. After all this project wasn't going to be hyped up by conventional means we surely weren't going to see flawed Christ figures on Burger King Cups. That surely wouldn't be very appetizing would it? In fact, if you've seen somebody's tips they shown for so far, ain't very appetizing. In fact, forget about Atkins. They've got a new dyna. The Jesus crusafiction diet. Hey, look what was on. Did you see that on CNN right now? The CNN presents special event of Sunday. The ministry of Jesus. Holy moly man. They're in and they were just good drowning in Jesus now.

Tomorrow is the deadline 155. Whoever leads gets the first trip and whatever you know how it goes. And we're getting back because article. Christian pushed behind the passion. Jesus filmed to be used to convert non Christians. The push began in mid to on before I continue. Last night, Deborah Norfield on MSNBC, which nobody watches any of those shows on that and work. But I, yeah, I'd like to see what they're doing. She had a debate between one of these right wing preacher guys and some left wing broad from some psychologists lady. About this movie. And the preacher guy came out in the middle of it. But the preacher guy was insisting that children are going to be allowed to see this. Now the movie's got an R rating because of the violence and the bloodshed. Right. But the children are going to be letting. And he says, well, we're going to have pastures to minister them in the lobbies after the movie if they have any questions. She said, you ought to be ashamed yourself. She must have said that many times. But third man. The ashamed yourself. Children can be traumatized by anything this violent. I've seen the previews and absolutely no way the children should be exposed to this insanity. And it has nothing to do with anything. Biblical. It just now gives him some yaddi out of it. And the preacher just kept repeating the same crap interrupting. Anyway, I just thought I'd mention that. Okay. The push began in mid January with a series of 12 screenings and nine Canadians cities over six days. And the end 9000 Christian pastors and church leaders, including 2000 the GTA, the greater Toronto or the film. The same group subsequently received a DVD featuring previews and in-depth interviews with Mel Gibson, who funded $25 million to produce the film and Jim Kavesel, the actor who plays Jesus. In the DVD Gibson and Kavesel both Christians talk about their motivations behind making the film and they're goodwill toward Jews. Oh, also being distributed by the consortium of Christian groups as instructional material both online and hard copy, designed to help pastude build sermons around the film and to guide parishners and their mission to share their Christian and their family. And share the Christian gospel with non-believers. That's what this is all about, converting the world. Coming at a time especially when we realize the insanity and the danger of fundamentalist religionists, only if they're Muslims. Only if they're schmakteds and others if they're on here is that it I see. You would think that people would have a little bit more respect for others at this time, but of course, President Hoffman's decisions. Well, while I do not agree with it, I will deal with it like I would expect one of my players to handle this gospel. Oh, comments were misinterpreted about why fire his ass, okay? I'm gonna tell him to have a call right about if they fire his redneck ass. Anyway, an example of this cemetery is an excerpt from a document on hsumenscentral.com, which proposes that Christian used the film as an excuse to do a prayer walk. Now, did you hear the language there? Do you think the film as an excuse to do a prayer walk? Listen to this. Carefully choose a neighborhood you believe God wants you to reach. Oh, God. With multiple prayer teams walk every street and pray for every house, asking that God will reach each person with a message of the cross to exposure to passion of the Christ. Leave a door hanger and a evangelistic book of the tom encouraging them to see the movie and fighting them to attend a passionate event at your church. What no Chinese menu? Wow. Maybe that's on her too. Now the chicks are in this crap. Oh, my God. It is opening on a whopping 2,000 screens in North America next Wednesday, including Todor and Canada, which is a big number of it independent film. The highly acclaimed monster, for example, which is also distributed by New Market Films in the US, has just expanded to a thousand ninety three screens in North America. But this one is opening on a whopping 2,000 screens. The consortium's aim is to ensure that I'm only Christians see this film but their friends and friends, friends see it too, while making an earnest attempt to stifle fears the film of not a rational anti-Semitism. Oh, and black executive pastor, the Mrs. Saga Gospel Temple, one of three locations the film was shown at the GTA makes no bones about the fact that Christian groups will be in full recruitment mode during films tenure in the limelight. People are being encouraged to take a non-Christian friend to say, look, consider this, what do you think about this? You said, this is a good thing to see. It's a wonderful way to dialogue about the Christian faith. And this whole sick concept that this man was crucified so that if you believe these storytails, you can go to heaven and live forever. Bob Kramer, the Director of Special Project for Campus Crusade for Christ, Coordinator of the Advanced Screenings, is organization is also about the website help guide Christians who want to share their gospel by means of the film. We believe that Christians will be deeply touched by this film and we're equipping people so that they'll be ready to answer questions for the non-Christian voice to this film because people would be blown away. You know that if you go to see this movie, it'll be blown away. I think I might fall asleep. Maybe father or tool will be there to help make sure that you're blown. Oh, so that after you're too old. In November Kramer and I can still say it and I will say it, okay? Don't have to drag me out kicking and screaming. I'll have to find me first. In November Kramer and funny other Christian leaders visited icon productions. They gifts an old outfit that created the film for the viewing of the, uh, then unfinished film having been profoundly affected. The group decided needed a strategy for want to create maximum impact. The January screenings and tutorial material are resolved at decision. Though the plan is born of a world of spread the Christian gospel that will inevitably translate to financial gain forgiveness and as affiliates, a source that equinox films the confirms Canadian distributed middle of that previous series wasn't an example of grassywoods marketing. The Kramer says it isn't about money. I think about it in terms of people and secrets of truth being put in touch with the gospel of truth. He said, I think of it as a marketing but not of dollars and cents, but in terms of a movement. If Mel Gibson makes money on this, he'll have turned around what most people thought was going to be his biggest mistake. It appears it could be successful, he said. Canada's Jewish community perhaps not surprising he wasn't asked to help with the film's promotion. Can't imagine why most of them were saying, oh, I'm so pleased. As per directors from icon productions members of that faith, we're not invited to private Sweden's and rabbi's schmubble spiro has put it an idea why ever her rabbi's schmubble spiro? He's my beloved name. So what's the Michael Jackson's rabbi there? The one he sees, whatever his name is, he almost is going to shmubble. If the viewing was for a missionizing purpose as I understand why they didn't call me, he said from Anshy mince congregation in Kensington market, I guess they didn't consider to be a good promoter for them. Some Jewish leaders filled a film with damaged Jewish Christian relations, the passion interpreted literally from Christian scriptures, implicates Jews with Jesus' brutal death. According to Abraham Foxman, the New York director of the anti-defamation league, the film portrays Jews as vengeful and bloodthirsty. Fueling those arguments here we go again, I want to repeat this, is the fact that gifts and recently embraced a fringe form of Catholicism known as, traditionalism, a faction that refuses to acknowledge the reforms of the second Vatican Council in 65, which absolved the Jews for the killing of Christ. Rabbi Michael Scoback of Jews for Judaism, a major out of group that focuses specifically on countering Christian attempts to convert Jews, said Canadian Jews shouldn't expect a film to cause a major disruption. For North Americans, my sense is one that the film is not going to undo decades of interfaith relations, my sense is that a lot of concerns will be more real in Europe and South America, where you get more overt acts of anti-Semitism. What we're monitoring is the fact that Christians will be using this film as a tool to convert people to their faith. Some Jews will be invited by friends or given free tickets or could hold into going, or like an A.S. Crusades, they'll be amazed and offer the camera fuse. The inquisition, oh I'm sorry, let's go back to DB surprise to see demonstrations in Toronto. Our philosophy here is not to be reactive. He said this is nothing new. It's not as if Christians have been trying to convert Jews for a long time. We didn't create this organization last night to deal with this film. It's an ongoing struggle to help educate the Jewish community, help them understand the teachings of their own faith. The audio audio. It's all about your crap. Leave everybody alone. DNH, do no harm. That's the bottom line. Okay. It's all about your crap. But I think the most interesting part of this whole deal, besides this stuff about Mel Gibson's father, his anti-Semite virulent lunatic father, is this stuff about Melize, recently embraced traditionalism, a fringe, right wing, fanatical form of Catholicism. We even said this by the way, because he's not extremely enough. He's a bottom. Yeah. So he said the Pope is a bottom. He's weak. But he says that so they will think that Mel might be a top, but you never can be sure. Okay. How many votes we got in this poll so far? What's your take on a religious right? 362. Somebody said it, Hubman drew it. I know what that means. They're nothing but hate-mongering morons. 129 said that. And keep in mind, this isn't just a Catholic thing. It's, you know, the fundamentals, anything. You name it, the Muslims, the Orthodox Jews. It's the born again Baptist, oh, man. The Jehovah's Witnesses, the religious nuts who just won't leave you alone. Right. Just like they want to go to. I think if they come to your house with unbless things, they want to stick on your door. I think that maybe I'd like, you know, point out to him. It's for your own good. 371 votes. They're nothing but a bunch of hate-mongering morons. 129. The whole religion thing is a big racket. 108. That's the religious writer. I don't mind if they would leave me alone. 43. They won't leave you alone. They're full of Shiite, 34. They gave their brains away to Faker's 21. On one of them praise God, 19. 5.1% of this crowd. A religious writer.

You'll be pleased with this. You probably just saw it. XN-RON's CE. Oh! Jeffy's skilling was charged with fraud insider trading today, making him the highest-ranking former executive charge in the collapse of the once mighty energy company. Those fakers, those great robbers at N-RON, which we say, is defensive-drink. He was just on their just-tick-or-lating and he was modding and he never stole a freight train, you know, too bad. The indictment in seal in Houston laid out 36 charges against skilling as well as new charges against Richard Caussi and Rons former CEO, who put it in a kill to six charges last month. The charges against skilling in Caussi alleged that from 1999 to 2001, the two-man-use various devices and schemes to manipulate in Rons' financial results. The indictment comes just five weeks after former N-RON CEO, and grew fast-out, played a guillotine to wire insecurities fraud and agreed with Colopso to cooperate with investigators probably in the accounting scandal. I'd like to say they say in Amsterdam, hubm in DRAID. Anyway, now we got these fakers, why did little research on my own? Well, this gets all complicated. Yeah, Eric even said, what? Are you talking about Alexa? Right. Okay. He said, what? Did it spyware? Well, here's the fact that it's said, it is spyware. In other words, it tracks your internet usage, although it's one of the more benign-spyware programs that's infringing on your privacy, I'd recommend using the guillotine to a bar instead, but it's also a blot's pop-up. No, it doesn't. And as a bonus allows you to highlight a word in any web page, your mic-clicked-to-do-a-goole search on a word. I've used the Google tool bar, it does not block pop-up, pop-pops marks. Here's another one. Big mic-in-saint pizzas be careful, Alexa is spyware, do a Google on Alexa they're watching, says Big Might and Sapy. So I did a little Google, yeah. And here's an ad for spy-fairit. We'll scan your computer for more than 400 of the most notorious spyware ad where programs that are available on the net table, which includes Alexa by the way, a list of many. The list goes all spyware ad where components on your PC, give your proof description about each component of the audio, they want to put a list for 39 bucks. I got a copy of spybot for free-famérique. Do I need that? You can use it? For what? What do I need that for? To clean up your spyware. I have an award, and that do that? I don't know. We're all in a try. Okay, I'm not, see, I'm not all paranoid, because number one, I'm not looking at Kitty poor, number two. There's nothing on there. I have nothing financial on this computer. Number three, who cares? You know? Do you understand? What genre of Scropwood said you would, and they come knocking on your door to your clock in the morning, if you have nothing to hide, then what do you hide? It's not about that. It's about all the other and cities things that it's doing, like slowing your computer down. No, it's not. Okay. My computer is as fast as lightning, Mr. is the tip of me lightning. Are you going to hit all ads up? Like if you have a hundred or more pieces of spyware, they're all doing their little thing, it's slowing you down. Well, maybe I don't have any more spyware. That could be. First, do you see? Maybe because I removed it every day with that other thing. Where? Oh, what is it? And anyway, I don't care. How to wait. 5, 6, 7. Now we'll probably get some calls on this. Or you better get that thing off there, then the less I like it. Okay. I like it. I'm very happy with it three days. I like the fact that he Eric does mommy to have it because he knows that I can email him 400 stories every day. Like in the time he used to take me to email 15 or 20. Because man, it's got that little icon in there. Do your email no matter what page you're on, but I'm being an Eric goes and you don't have to keep filling in all the names on area. Just the whoever you're sending it to. Who has it? There it goes. Just like that. Come to QM's FireLine. Hello. How you doing today? Pretty good. I want to know, where did these priests get off thinking that they can go out, molesting these children and they think that they're above the law and that nothing can happen to them. Well, that goes back to that whole thing about what do they call that law a George, which word can and law can civil law. That was the thing that we're bringing up on this whole number of questions. And that's the first law a couple of years ago. Right. And as if they're above the law of any country that they're living in, they can make up their own laws and don't confuse this with the fact. Hey, they answered a God. Right. You know, if these politicians got off of their brain that they're sitting on. Right. And started protecting children and people from these people that were in positions that are able to hurt people and have nothing done about it. See, it's a people like Michael Powell, where nearly is concerned about all of children that are being molested is they are concerned about seeing Janet Jackson's booby for half a second on the Super Bowl. Then maybe we get somewhere. It's just a bunch of posturing and pandering because it's in election year. They want to show us how much more pies and holy and better they are than anybody else. Even though the administration is slaughtering and getting our people slaughtered every day. You're right. They're worried about the wrong things. Is this this priest that there should be double or triple the penalty for a regular person because of the brain? Right. Are put in the position where they're supposed to be higher? They're a lot about that. You're supposed to be able to leave your children with a priest and not worry about what's going to happen. Correct. It is absolutely correct because they play on the cross-stay. They're not like they trusted the child and the family and then they exploited and the abuse. And we've still always seen the tip of the iceberg. This business is about 4,400, whatever it is. That's the tip of the iceberg. Believe it. But one, one religion you don't believe here that's happening in is the Jewish religion. That's not true. How about the Rabbi in the Bokoka few months ago that most molesting the Kede that was setting up dates on the internet? Sir, let me tell you, they're all a bunch of a fakers. Okay? Not if you're one of the ministers in priest and rabbi's, but I'm just saying as far as the religions are concerned, it's just a fakeery. The reason you see more of it in the Catholic Church is because of their unnatural attitude about sex. Sex is only for procreation. Any other? Well, I mean, what a bunch of crap. I remember that story years ago about the handicap guy. Right. Want to get married in Chicago when a Catholic Church wouldn't marry them. Okay. These were devout catalyze, but they couldn't consummate the religion. They couldn't have sex. Now, on one hand, sex is so evil, but if you're doing it to make more Catholic babies, then it's a wonderful blessed thing. That's right. I mean, just without an use, you're new to a little bit boys and girls use your brain. Okay? That's the whole reason that they're sitting there on the other side rubbing themselves raw while the kids are telling them, oh, I touched myself last night father. I did three times. Yeah. And they're sitting there just rubbing themselves raw. That's the excuse they give because you have to forgive your, uh, be forgiven for your sins because sex is a sin. Right. For them, it's okay. But sex is a sin. Just like that one priest that Mike Wallace was tracking down on 60 minutes a few years ago when they did that story, the priest that was doing the girl. Right. Is that the way there was the child? He said it wasn't a sin because there was no passion. Remember that line? Yeah. What about the first old past? Right. Are you starting up again? Jesus Christ. 560560 pound 560 on the AT&T. I'm telling you, like I said, I believe that you can believe whatever you want until you get to the point where you start hurting other people with it. At that point, that's where any sensible, rational person draws the line. And when you use it to as an excuse, well, the Bible says, yeah, the Bible says a lot of crap because it was written by primitive people. I said, it's your to be for the show this morning. Just stop and think if you took the people over over hundreds of years who wrote all of that nonsense, all of that superstitious mumbo jumbo, if you took them through the time tunnel and you brought them here today and you sat them down here and they were all these cars and TV sets and they heard me talking on the radio or anybody else and all these CDs and all these stuff. They said, I need you. Right. And they would say, like that, they could have come in with. They probably be like an mental institution immediately because they couldn't stand it because they were so ignorant and so primitive and much of superstitious getchies. Right. Every time it was reigned, it was an act of God. God was crying. God was angry. And to use this garbage to justify treatment of women and blacks and getchies. And anybody else, this doesn't fly with anybody who's rationed, anybody who's got a brain which leaves out Mel Gibson, by the way. They didn't even know what a rainbow was for Christ's. Oh, it's a message from God. Don't you understand? I thought it was a case symbol. It is. It's a rainbow flag. 26 passed 11 at 560. Your flagship station for the whatever those teams are. All right. And look over here's Fort 20560 show�. Swmat Fl licensesSゆy authentically They sit and watch the TV with finger up there but well, why doesn't know what something or Christian is through. I love to know why I love to know why I love to know why I love to know why I love to know You've been through a Michael Powell on the website Do they get it stolen, honey? While cleaning out their guns What do you want to know why I love to know what Christians you've been born Do they all in love the fish? I'm a fan of the Trump What do I love to know why I love to know what Christians you've been born Do they all in love the fish? I'm a fan of the Trump And watch it all down with the 12th act of truth To the life of order of the heaven you go I don't least find the fun for the national I love to know why I love to know why I love to know I'm a third man I want to just say during the middle of the night There's a new picture of Michael Powell on our website On our website Well, it's a little close to lunch But I'll take a chance FTC is speaking to that target's man cow in Chicago In Disney Crackdown, thanks to who was it? Or listener of Fred and Chicago Who facts this to us? And it was a bad copy Fred, so I just printed it right out from the old Chicago sometimes Went and out, I printed it right out Where the hell would I be without the internet these days, you know? I don't know, hard to think Because pretty soon your radio and TV are going to be virtually useless to you As far as getting any real information I think they already are Right, as far as seeing like any titillating pictures or things like that Or reading about what's really happening in the rest of the world, forget about it Okay, let's take a few good girl Michael Powell, let's see There's a sure and stone Oh man Oh my god That is the best Oh no No, no He'll probably be on national geographic this Sunday And look at that, he's sitting right over math fudge Better look out, miss fudge And Matt is looking at what he's looking at what is magnifying glass Looks like he's looking at his spectrum Specting before like dives in That is a beautiful thing, man Where do we get that from? Oh magic Oh magic I bet you're actually probably sending it over Maybe part of her and seeing that baby Take a look, I mean first take a look at Sharon's stone And then you can prepare you can prepare Sharon's stone She ain't got nothing to prepare to Michael Powell I think that's a good idea Can you hear me work? Has he got a pair? Or what? Oh here's our death notes, we'll get to that Gary says if you want a web browser that blocks pop-ups Try a firebird at mazzilla.org It's lightning quick and I get no pop-ups I don't get any pop-ups either with Alexa or their spine on me Also, it's as I know the bush A wall thing's been beaten to death But after reading this week's newsweek Articot I think the most important point is being missed Carry in his classmates volunteer to go to Vietnam Because they initially supported the war and fell with their duty Bush also supported the war and despised all the anti-war protesters But instead of enlisting the help fight-awary support And he used his connections to avoid getting drafted Then he can't even bother to follow through with that What does that say about his character? Also, does he still think to be at Nammore was anything But a huge costly and deadly mistake if so It goes a long way to explain the mess where now says Gary Good point, Solomon Jerry But he's too stupid to understand that He was a party boy who's just a busy-getting laden Brinking a lot maybe Take a little up the nose Mark Avery all-in-know that's bad news Actually know who this is In fact, I know who's a several of these people. Look at this Mark Avery Detroit radio personality who during the top 40-RNA in the 1960s Fun tunes at WJBK and WXYZ was a long time for minier boys It varies radio stations in Detroit over the years And who hosted an annual televised charity auction in pledge drive for channel 56 Di'd February 15th in Evansville in the NFR Longnullis he was 74 Mark Avery, good guy He had that sound, there were guys the Lee Allen Paul Witter and Mark Avery they had a Dave Prince and Don Z What a memory They all had that same kind of Thrody sound at WXYZ was a great station And then some genius came in there Turned into a talk station and changed the Collears to WXYT What an asshole man, wouldn't idiot W ABC and WXYZ the greatest collardars in the history of radio And they call it an Enchanger Reverend John Minkler died Alvin in New York priest will allegedly wrote a 1995 letter Which recently surfaced to Cardano Connor that accused Bishop Howard Hubbub Of being part of a ring of homosexual priest who was asked by Huber What we knew he died right right He wrote the letter and then all of a sudden he was found dead at Thibworth 15th at Waterfleet New York and a parent suicide It was 57 a parent suicide He wrote that it was kind of like Dr. David Blake in England Same kind of a straight also stuttering John Mullen This is leaving the Howard Stern radio show To become the new announcer on the night show with Jay Leno who had placed at Hall of Left Is Show to pursue acting I'm leaving because the money is a lot better And I was always wanted to be an LA Melinda said yesterday Advertisement to get a sitcom to be in a sitcom And acting has been really important to me Said stuttering John Ozzy Osborn's wife Sharon is a great Some osfast bands by demanding they pay upwards of a hundred grand To perform in the traveling heavy metal show It's a probative for prohibitive for smaller bands That are source to know and share in his focus And try to get Metallica slip knot and Judas priest Son on headline the tour A rep said the Osborn's traditionally charged the lesser known bands for marketing fee But the Osborn's paid the larger bands and it will not be a slew of doctors in the road And WPLG Channel 10's Peter O'Donj Peter Denge 53 longtime Broward your reporter got taken off the air station Brass Tobinic in Ray on staff as a behind-the-scenes problem solvus producer Denge's contract is up March 31 He's been taken off the air Peter Denge channel a 10 Know who that is? Okay, it's been taken off the air kind of like Dave game but after the same reason Dave game was taken off the air because even after we got our 62 in sets We still couldn't see all of them now now. Well, we got just a lot of fish to fry here, man WQAM hello Yes sir Take a morning you know talk about pop up walkers and spyware. They're really two different things of course A pop up blockers, you know, what ad that come up as a result of going to right was a website But spyware can be very malicious because what it does is it hides files that either can gather information about where you've gone on the internet Different you can go to 10 different sites and and then the company that wants to see where you've been to can then go and look at that cookie Unbeknownst to you know what you're doing something else I can then get a grab the information as they owe this user has been to this site That's I bet that's I et cetera The program that George recommended spybot search in the destroy. Yeah, absolutely free. There's no charge And it actually not only will scan and remove all the spyware authorities there It will actually like protect from future spyware coming on. Okay. What is it again? spybot and the AP search and destroy. Eric is emailing you the link for it. Okay. Okay. It's a great program in the price of the right. So in order to be able to I can keep my election, but I can install that. Exactly. spyware isn't going to spybot is not going to like Alexa according to all right. Oh, all right. Yeah, it'll give you a chance to win that one piece A lot of money. Good personal about it. You know. Okay. Thanks a lot. All right. Okay. Now. What do you tell me it's not going to like Alexa what is happening? In the end, we'll get to a fistfight right there on my screen. That might be interesting. It'll come up on the list of spyware. The spybot reports the spyware that's on your computer and it will report Alexa as spyware, but that doesn't mean that you have to get rid of it. You just unchecked the box and delete all the other ones. I see presumably. I see. Well, I'm not as nervous about it as some of you are pervert. Some of you people are. I'm not to that concern. Hey, I'm a reality picture is an unproud. I see. Spide bots spybot. But. Okay. By the way, I got to get to this FCC and handcout thing in Chicago. We will get to that. And of course, that was the show that for RAL was on briefly, but I think it was probably a good decision on his part. To go to Atlanta. Although I don't know, Atlanta is a pretty right wingman, pretty Yahoo, even though there's a lot of sources there. It's pretty, uh, it makes Tampa seem very liberal by comparison. Green tea. But I guess it doesn't matter how filthy you are because nobody's going to be clean enough to suit anyone. That's right. Nobody can be quite pure enough like ivory soap. 99 and 44 100% pure to satisfy Michael Powell. And of course, no one who's got that big Powell's to drag around. My. And low. This is for 23. 56. You. You. You. You. Hey guys, you want to cheer up. Have. Bring me sit on your face. Make that old act. Clear all when we're. Need. Sit on your face. Go. Go get about your wife. Look out for now.

Eric, I already got it, I'm going to hit you I'm becoming so computer little bit now for no-far That it really is scary to me I can't imagine anybody that's got more like ten bucks Since there's so much of a cheaper now They can't imagine any old far just because they're a funny That it's just too new-fangled for me I mean, cut the crap People are leaving them out on the swale for the garbage Right, that's right That's right, you know, the out-of-date ones How's swale doing by the way? Is he still running? I think he's in the fourth of the gulstream It called it, swale Look at that, it's this thing is just It works exactly just ran, add a little bit of a little bit of a go But just to hear where you, I ran, swive up my hand up with swike And it's even the menu is exactly the same So I think add a word and this thing or the same thing And it's scanning and it's looking and it's searching And it's destroying and it's seeking and it's sniffing out And it's so it's going through there Anyway, SEC speaking of sniffing it out It targets manco in a decent seat crack down Says Robert Feeder sometimes calmness in Chicago Washington's renewed crusade against broadcast in the SEC He came back to Chicago yesterday to bite manco Muller in the backside again and the old back to him Bottom The SEC said it for broadcast to manc...

Bush Scott read as the senior strategist to prime minister Paul Martin But according to mr. Bush mr. Martin has the prettier Scott Indeed welcome to a new era of pretty face Kennedy West relations. This is what happened Mr. Bush meant Mr. Reed earlier this week at the summit in Monterey, Mexico just after the president's breakfast with mr. Martin Mr. Reed was not initially in the hotel room where the two leaders and their closest advisors met but was called in to breathe the prime minister at the end As the group waited for the media mr. Bush wanted over doing mr. Reed's chat with the prime minister mr. Reed introduced himself in shook hands with mr. Bush Well, what do you do for this guy the president asked as he pointed to the prime minister? Well, you know sir. I can't really say mr. Reed said it's not that I don't want to assist you know I don't really know from day to day. This is true mr. Reed handles the number of files and performs the number of different duties depending on the issue in the day The president chuckle, well, you got a pretty face he told the surprise mr. Reed he wasn't done. You got a pretty face he said again You were good looking guy better looking than my Scott anyway This is true his Scott it has a receding her line is on the trebuchadneut but mr. Martin Scott has a full head air in his quite fit for the first time in his life mr. Reed had no reply I didn't know what to say said mr. Reed noting later that he wished mr. Bush a referred him as a rugged looking young man or something But I'll take what I can I guess he joke when a Texas Republicans says you've got a pretty face then I guess there's just no way around it It's a good thing he didn't say you got a real pretty mouth Because then he'd been in deep then run like bottom like a Deep dude who don't say it whatever you're gonna say don't say think about a several times see think about it if a 70-year-old child would be offended by it run like a cheetah WQM hello WQM hello Welcome to yes sir Sean Matthew from a compartment did you see any interviews the guy that plays Jesus in that movie no He was going on in two different interviews. There's a who's going on about how Was it he was struck by lightning while he was filming yeah, and yeah the first day lied and they said he was struck by lightning three or four times They enveloped a little bit then it turned out he had like a brush at one time deal and And the people said there was a globe behind him and stuff and then he was talking to God getting a problem Oh my god, yeah, also maybe God was sending him a message he was pissed off about this movie maybe but I got not too crazy about these goiam Did you shave the dinosaur or interview no okay I guess the white right wing we're probably can't find a like so much because he was going on about how was it I guess he was talking about when he was thinking about killing himself or something you know Mel Gibson Yeah, or I can't remember when exactly an interview it was but he was saying something like he was going to go someplace and hide and he said He was going to go off and hide maybe with the weapons of mass destruction then nobody'll ever find me He actually said that you and I could believe it. I was like guy the way to the you know the Republicans who think that Bush is completely Insoluble and you know he can do no wrong and he's never wrong wait till later this I mean that I doubt they ever heard it because all eight watches Tvn and Christian listen Christian radio. Yeah, and thank the Lord for that And don't forget the seven hundred we're club and I'll pray for it. Thank you I wish they could hear this and we're saying seen it because you know maybe they'll have a little more doubt about him Where there's no sense there's no feeling. Yeah, have a great day. Thank you. Barney Frank opposes game error jepard Remember I told you this a long time ago and we got side track like you should quiet and I don't need to listen to money fact Barney Frank crying in in my ear because I made a few bucks out of a book I worked okay. Thanks a lot Representative Barney Frank said San Francisco's decision to challenge state law and grant marriage licenses to same size couples could damage efforts by gay rights activists To defend the Massachusetts court decision legalizing gay marriage I was sorry to see the San Francisco thing before it said Frank had openly gay congressman for Massachusetts Who shared his concern with fellow Democrats in San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom before the city began mirroring gay couples last week And interview with the ANP Frank expressed concern that the image of lawlessness and civil disobedience in San Francisco We're leading some in Congress to support a federal constitutional men and bany gay marriage He said he hope Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision reporting to write the same sex couples to marry with service a national model for orderly legal protection of gay marriage If we go forward Massachusetts and get same sex on a book, it's gonna be binding in contestable said Tuesday instead San Francisco's move promotes the notion that unpopular laws can be broken or ignored When you're in a real struggle San Francisco making a symbolic point becomes a diversion he said So there you go He's again it, but in the meantime he got over 23.

That's probably who have community stand that would be like saying well you can read whatever book We decide is up to community standards for Miami or for Chicago or for New York or even for Geneva, New York and the standards are being set by the most church lady of the mall Right exactly there is no such thing as community standards except those things that are universally like for example You don't have a horse out in the corner of a 441 and I've very road there. You have to do it in private I mean there are some things that are pretty much universal right like the idea of what you choose to read what you choose to look at on the internet What you choose to say on a radio what you choose to watch on your cable.

WQAM hello Yeah, I'd like to comment do you take calls? Well, that's probably where you have the numbers out is which they call us now or I just kill some good time Go ahead you're on right now sir. I'm traveling is first I'm listening to your show and I'll be down I've been down. Oh Don't the where you from The Midwest I want to come don't come back to Florida again man. Okay the state Go ahead my question is like I was just like a flip in channels and just listening and the the I'm not a Republican But I am a Christian and I was I was trying to connect the dots between your call or a few minutes ago If that's somehow Right wing Republicans are also Christians who support the Mel Gibson movie and I'm trying to Can you all those out we can say all of them? What do you mean you're trying to close dots? Well Yeah, that you were supporting that conversation and as if that's reality Yeah Do you think it is? I'm not saying that they're all supporting But first of all right, when Republicans are all Catholics and as you well know many born again Christians hate Catholics and vice versa Like boys that's a good old-time religion. That's what will do for the world. I don't I don't know that You don't know that that many I don't again Christians hate Catholics. You don't know that No, I don't know that. Well, how well have you been living under a rock somewhere? You're not so don't me. I don't know how could you not know that? I don't believe that's true statement, but I guess if you know I don't know believe that there's a tremendous long historical rift between most Protestant evaluations and the Royal Catholic Church That's not what you said a moment ago That's a Your drawing your drawn a connection of Centuries and centuries ago and somehow you're saying that it's happening today. Oh, absolutely Absolutely, having you wow You find that revolutionary having you heard the jury of Paul Wells and the other born again back to the cry the catheter church There's a difference between them, but that they hate each other. Oh, many of them do yes, in fact You take all the way. Oh, no, you're not you're not saying you're you're using your words very uniquely You're not using it and you're saying very I'm just saying I'm just saying and you're not listening anything that I'm saying to you. Oh, I'm listening I'm just trying to understand what exactly it is you're saying because you keep coming Yes, or don't you understand Well, I don't understand your misuse of your own words and it's simply being if you'd simply be consistent Such as anyone anyone anyone could either just read what why don't you tell me what you're talking about Studying this little dance they always do tell what you're doing the dance, but if you'll stop the inderogatory We can have an opportunity to have any conversation unless you answer the question Okay, if you want to have a two-way All right, so here's the point. Yes, you're going to make the statement what's that statement that Christians Kate Catholics I didn't say that I didn't say that I didn't say that I don't realize it I don't have to because I know what I said asshole I said that a lot of born again Christians hate Catholics like poison and vice versa Just like a lot of Orthodox Jews hate the other Jews who aren't Orthodox and throw bricks at their homes in Brooklyn It's the fact it's not my opinion Wake up and see if the Daphatos man, what do you see was from the Midwest?

Yes And Sharpton asked him how many black members That were in his cabinet And when he was governor of Vermont And but to be better and he totally fumbled it And then the next day said he wasn't prepared for the question This was a question about race It was the black and brown debate About minorities And he wasn't prepared for the question He wasn't prepared to run That was the problem He did a lot of ballsy things of great But he just And you know people are just going to say well You know the media was unfair Well that's true but then this is the point When you're running your presidential campaign You can't be unpresident because you don't need you to the cross I'm sorry That was a bad question That was a bad question Okay, I'm so sorry I apologize I'm so sorry This is for trading a place You way I got a great story about Bob Jones University of Manicue, Tom You're going to love him There he was just a walkin on the sea Saying to what it did it done They did it done He's a man from the land of Cali Saying to what it did it done They did it, he's good He's good He's good He's good He blended Ted change his water into wine The next thing I knew we had Only man on his feet Saying to what it did it done They did it do They're blinded a prophecy and the tomaz o' the hear and to what it did it done paper But what it did it does I to what done Cotton Whoa, oh some say he's the son of God.

I had forgotten, I didn't forget, but I put away in a back of my mind, and behind Harold and Sandy Fisher and Walter Ross and Red Ross. I have more important things to think about. About the Bob Jones University flap. How that I would ever forget about Bob Jones. Pat you cannon, you'll recall spoke there. Yeah. Before W. Put it any rate! Here's an article I found on the internet just now did little search and Bob Jones University to come up with something really quick to give you an idea, and again for that guy who's looking for an education from the Midwest who can't find one there. Vena Thomas writes Bob Jones True Colors. George W. Bush was heavily criticized for appearing at Bob Jones University and not acquitted the college known for being racist and anti-cathlete. He's made no attempt to distance himself from any of the philosophers of the university, perhaps leading some people to think he's supported the college's beliefs, though Bush denied the allegations and subsequently apologized the image remained in the public's eye. Not sure how a university could be both racist and anti-cathlete can get away with it. I decided to do some research. I located the college's website and began to browse. Not surprisingly, the site had an entire section devoted to recent press coverage and in defense of the institution. Bob Jones, the tour president of Bob Jones University, wrote a formal press release in support of his college, it reads like a used car salesman's pitch. Bob Jones manages to alienate half the people in his speech whom he so desperately needs to convince the support of his college while championing religious freedom in the US, he marks Islam Judaism and Roman Catholicism as he wonders why some of their fundamental beliefs have been attacked sooner. Wait, isn't he supposed to be trying to convince us that he and his university are not anti-cathlete? Religious freedom and allowing others to believe in practice what they want is one of the ideas upon which this country was founded, yet a Bob Jones kept insisting that he was not any Catholic, what would cause others to think so. There must be a complication here. Sure enough, upon reading a transcript of Larry King interviewing Bob Jones, I found a clue. Stated Larry King, but if you call the Pope the anti-crisis, you'll offend Catholics. Instead of refuting this statement or done I had ever done such a thing, he instead supported himself. Yes, but you know, article 6 of the Westminster Confession caused the Pope at anti-crisis reported Jones. Not anti-cathlete? His repeated analysis of anti-cathlete beliefs were fast-waring thin, especially way to could hardly make it through it to now without bashing Catholics. Undoubtedly, his case wasn't helpful when Larry King asked, did you call George W. Bush's father or devil and Jones replied, you know I did? Bob Jones seemed very confused by King and managed to trip up often and look like an idiot, as Jones later ran and raved about all the liberals that Harvard and Yale King had to remind him that George W. Bush graduated from Yale. Jones had nothing to counter with, except, well it's possible for him to come through the system and not buy into it. What about the allegations of racism? In the course of defending himself from such allegations Jones managed to insinuate that blacks and other races come from broken homes and abuse of families, as he clueless at how the support himself or does he just have opinions too strong to hide for very long. What exactly were the allegations? Apparently Bob Jones' University has had an official ban on interracial dating for many many years. It's just a vacation. We stand against the one world government against the coming world of anti-cright, which is a one-world system of blending all differences of blending of national differences, economic differences, church differences into one big, ecumenical world. VJ uses it with preferred to keep the races separate as a student put it, my own personal belief is that God has made racist perfect, God has made white perfect in blacks or the orientals and he hasn't given us any reason to win or mixed those races. But he has made them perfect. It's not a policy that discriminates against the whites of the blacks or the orannels, but it's a policy that's equal of two-all three of the races. Excuse me, all three of the races don't they teach students a VJ, you do not everyone fall so neatly to one of these three categories? After the media spotlight hit VJ, you suddenly demand an interracial dating was dropped. There's sudden decision to eliminate the ban, troubled me almost as much as they're having it. Said Jones, we have a broader testimony and if all anybody can see is this rule which we never talk about or preach, which most of our students could even tell you what it is, why should we have this here as an obstacle? If Jones claims this rule is so insignificant then why was it implemented for so many years and why did students have such strong views favoring the ban? On the reverse side, if the rule was so important to the university as it seemingly implied by its existence, why did they instantly eliminate it when it was attacked? What about standing up for your beliefs? What are Bob Jones' universities' true beliefs? What does Bob Jones deterred we to stand for, does he have the strength to stand for anything? The father me bothers me most is that someone like Bob Jones can preach what he likes, including prejudice and animosity toward other religions and can shape the minds of impertable college students, all under the guise of freedom of religion. Where do we draw the line? Sadly, Bob Jones can stand on the soapbox and preach what he likes and no one can stop him. What a beautiful column by Vina Thomas on the internet. And that nice? Christians don't hate. I mean, just a shock in this may and that call is voice. I can't believe you're saying these things like you really believe them. My bad. My bad. It's your bad. That's bad. I'm a bad guy because I tell the truth. Let's see Boston the music's to him it just facts this in. Libraries to get 124,000 CDs to spring as part of a settlement. The music selection libraries across the state of Massachusetts is about to get much better as part of a 143 million dollar national settlement of a lawsuit over CD prices. The 488 public libraries and Massachusetts will be receiving 124,000 music discs more than 1900 different titles this spring. In addition, 68,000 consumers who submitted claims to be functioned be seeing checks for almost 14 bucks a piece in a mailbox in the coming week a 30 general time are all he said. Massachusetts was one of 40 states that agreed to settle a lawsuit which accused major record companies and large music retailers out conspiring to set minimum prices on music. Under that settlement, a total of three and a half million people are to get checks and schools across the country will get 75.7 million dollars worth of CDs. So there you go. So there are your refunds and buy a Schmidt load of blank CDs and burn baby burn says the facts. How do you like that? Shame on you sir. Shame on you.

Oh, there goes all our more ways out to win. Well, that's all you straight people. I don't see any gay people overpopulating the world making too many babies. This is what I'm thinking. I could be wrong about that. Although, two of those dice out there in Frisco that they were interviewing the god married last week. And they said, oh, well, we're planning on planning on having a family and having some babies. And I thought for myself, oh, okay. Now, how does that work? Oh, there's a variety of ways.

In other words, I don't know why he has the guest on there. Like a prop. He'll ask the question. They'll start to answer it. And then he just continues jumping in to make it look like he's a hard ass interviewer. But he does let him say anything. Does he ever reach reach? Can he talk like a normal person? No, he's not capable of doing that. So he's one of how many reasons? Not good man. I know buddy. Was his MSNBC except you and me once in a great while.

It's on our website. Walmart nation, the race to the bottom. Los Angeles is now my kind of town, but the Angelinos are about to take a stand that ought to be applauded across the country's says Floyd McKay. That's status to say no to Walmart's Supercenter that retailing giant hopes to open in the city. These superstars are not your founders Walmart, their monstrous sprawling over some 25 acres and employing up to 600 workers their lure of course is lower prices. Walmart, it seems to me, he says it pitomizes the race to the bottom that has the US by the throat as the 21st century opens. Why do people shop at these behemoths when they know full weather that they're driving out of existence small businesses owned and operated by their neighbors and employing other neighbors? They shop because of price and they're forced to do so by the declining standard of living we've offered working people for more than a generation. People are work for minimum wage, but little or no benefits, who can't afford to fix their car or their kids' teeth had no choice but to search out the lowest prices. Walmart buys offshore without a apology and for the cheapest possible prices from companies paying the lowest possible wages. As jobs in America are lost to foreign sweatshops to feed the Walmart engine, American workers are forced to accept jobs in lower pay with bad working conditions, their fun with the Walmart's promise to cheap goods and affect patronizing the very companies that cause their economic misery. This is a cruel, privacy and working people in these countries. While their practice is alleged abuses of labor laws, hiring illegal and the low rate of pay in benefits of Walmart served to the press labor market and communities in which the giant is located. This is a major factor in LA's opposition to the Supercenter. They're going to have the balls to say to Walmart, you can be the whole thing on our website please. Just say no to Walmart. And what was I saying this the other day pretty soon? In matter just a few years, they're going to be like five, six companies own everything. All the retail outlets, all the restaurants, all the newspapers, all the radio stations, all the TV stations, you name it, it'll be them. And either do business with them or work for them or baffongula baby, that's it. That's your choice. How many QAM hello? Yes sir. I played golf with a good friend of yours and great guy is I had no idea this guy was a thief and because you made him up to be a monster. Demeless man. You know who you? No I don't.

This is the greatest bass I've had in a long time. This hour anyway. The passion of Christ, a weapon of mass indoctrination. See, not beautiful. Thank you very much, whoever sent that. That's a beautiful song, a weapon of mass indoctrination. Well said. Well, speaking of that, I didn't get a chance for this one yesterday, but here it is today. From the New York Daily News, a Queen's priest who's listed the large crimes and codes Crank calling a Catholic High School and packing a pistol. We have confessed yesterday to another sin stealing from a long island church. The Reverend John Johnston 64, pretty good to one kind of grandlars, the felony punishable by a toy or jail. Now saw a system district attorney Steven Stephanie Meister said, John said a minute stealing 50 grand from St. Martin of Tour Church in Bethpage from 1998 to 2003, 50 Gs. KG's. Johnston who worked part time at a church for a church for 25 years actually was suspected of his taking as much as a 100 grand from its weekly collection plates, stealing 60 to 100 bucks after each Sunday mass. Well he probably had to mods an end to take care of you know. And when cops searched his bottoms, when cops searched his jet-nights, Queens of Parmanlyst fall, Johnston led him to a bag stuff a more than 80 grand. Some of the money still sealed and green envelopes, bearing personars names. Oh my God, audio suckers out there. Keep handed over these grave robbers all your cash on your heart or money. It's like blackmail if you want to go to heaven, then hand it over like you're being held up at gunpoint. But Meister said, what was his name again? Meister? Or her name? Stephanie Meister. The Stephanie Meister. Meister said that after reviewing the priest bank accounts, Prussia Gudis came up with a $50,000 figure because it was the amount we could prove. It's unlikely, Johnston served any jail time when St. Staples 16 by Nassau County Judge Donald Delphi is attorney Joe Stella said his time was offered probation by Prussia Gudis because he's agreed to pay church back to 50 grand. They will be made more than whole, Stella said. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. They will be made more than whole. Are you spawning that with a W or an H? Stella said he couldn't come out of why the priest took the money or what he did with it until the charges he faces in Brooklyn and Queens are resolved. He has no habits, no problems, the guy was without vices other than this. No gambling, no women he's running with, no little boys, no nothing. He just likes steel and money. And it all listen to this. Johnston said was a spowsh when cops went to his Queens of Parvand, October 7 to arrest him for allegedly making profanity lace calls to the principal of Bishop Glockman High School in Brooklyn. He has no other problems. In addition to the cash police also found gay porn and on license gun in the stash of Nazi memorabilia, a virtual shrine that they third write in his closet included German flags, helmets, daggers swised to cousin pictures of it off Hitler. He has no problems. Johnston was a respected English and religion teacher for 23 years that or took a prep school in Summit, New Jersey, where he was finally referred to as father JJ. A source at Johnston referred to as Stephen from the Long Island Church as his 401k plan. Wow. The motive behind the vulgar messages left for Brother Dennis Cronin and Bishop Lachum was less clear, but prosecutor said he'd be a graduate against the DLSL Christian brothers who went to Brooklyn High School. Some investigators speculated that Johnston was angry with the former principal of the orphan school who became the headmaster of the territory prepping whom he blamed for forcing him to retire. While there he goes, some make some crank calls and by the way enjoy your gay porn and your swastiepe is. Very good. No issues. He's going to pay back and make him hold. I say we like to hear the whole of the ground and stick his ass in or as soon as his bottom in there. 560560 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless.

I think I know the guy who's talking about it. He's a company of men who does it. So, when we go to the movies and when they're kind of like a loving scene comes up, they got to, they make their kids close their eyes and put their heads down. Oh, I'm so low. Oh, I'm hilarious. It's crazy. Oh, another thing, if I may, add something. Yes sir. Please. When George W was talking about two weeks ago about, when he was on me depressed.

So in other words, they did their follow up with the phone call. All right. I actually thought of twice. Good. Oh, thank goodness. Because, you know, the fall book was all screwed up because they weren't following up for the A Diaries with phone calls. So as a result, the ethnic minority people who get five bucks instead of what do you get? Two bucks? Exactly. I think that's what they were saying all the damage back. Right. I just did it. My neighbor got twice as much as we did. His last name before us. I was cracking out by said I said, you're that familiar by your way in. Tell me your name is Rodriguez, man. Fifty bucks.

Oh, maybe they can get some rocks from the guiding she ate But the Reverend forest church of all souls unitary and church on the upper East side you are called the pinnets macabre I expected prominence of the nail reflexed prominence of the gore in the movie itself He said that becomes the icon for identification. Well said now That's great about the scientists Decrying the White House And we're the guy talk about reports on our website, but it's short right Scientists accused White House of distorting facts the bush administration has deliberately insistomatically distorted scientific fact In it the service of policy goals on the environment health biomedical research and nuclear weapon We at home in abroad a group of about 60 influential scientists including 20 Nobel laureates said in the statement issued yesterday The sweeping changes were later discussed at a conference call with some of the scientists that was organized by the union of concerned scientists and Independent organization that focuses on technical issues and has often taken stands at odds with the administration policy The organization also issued a 37 page report yesterday that it said detailed the accusations Together the two documents accused the administration of repeatedly Sensoring and suppressing reports by its own scientists Stacking advisory committees with unqualified political appointees Disbanding government panels that provide unwanted advice and refusing to seek any independent scientific expertise in some cases Other administrations have on occasion engage in says practices, but not so Systematically you know on so wide or front the statement from the scientists said adding they believe the administration had missed Represent scientific knowledge and misled the public about the implication of its policies What how spokesman Scott McLean said yesterday he had not seen the tech to the accusations But he said I can assure you this is an administration to make decisions based on the best available science Dr Kurt Gondfreed and Emeritus Professor physics at Cornell who signed the statement in spoke in the conference call Said the administration and engaged in practices that were in conflict with the spirit of science and scientific method Dr. Goppy decided that what he called the Cavalry attitude towards science could place at risk the basis for the nation's long-term prosperity Health and military prowess The scientists denied they had any political motives in releasing documents as the 2004 presidential race began to take shape The organizations report Dr. Goppy said to take any year to prepare much longer than originally plan to be released as soon as it was ready I don't see it as a partisan issue at all said Russell train who served as an administrative the environment protect the EPA under President Nixon and Gerald Ford And was spoken the conference call in support of the statement if it becomes that way I think it's because the White House chooses to make it a partisan issue Mr. Train said again who served under Nixon and Ford in the EPA?
