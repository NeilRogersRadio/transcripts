That's your special Joe. That's your real visual, Big Joe. My usual. I'm here to tell you who I am. My enemy for Dler Day on. Rumor I'm here to tell you when Till Watson and Rumon Mo is leaving in the morning to a drop to Muna Bomba, and it puts you in the bar as good. What's that? Oh, and there's pockets we, what they're meant. Now that I thought wrongly something to ration. You were in hate the fortune, and Apple sends up a bread. If the matter right you remain in torture instead. On Korean I racked me, boss we hate them. Boss something that we know they did not do. O show power and mercy on you, pay John. Now we're all screwed. And there's no victory, but that's freedom. And I'll let your five bar buy and fill their name. And those they get in vain, and they'll call me in a pile. There's a cold that closes their teeth and smile. Over the street, all that great that's far, far. And there's no atrocities more far. Which we should like, remember, to only follow borders. And all what we think of, that's our responsibility, to make that whole night. That's the perfect rocker on our daughter, they're high. I hate this place, nothing works here. The medications don't work. I've been here for seven years. Nothing works here. I hate this place, nothing works here. The medications don't work. I've been here for seven years. I hate this place, nothing works here. Happy Thursday, too. 10 or three, it's five, 60 WDQ, I'm the home of technical insanity. And what was that again? The deck pot was open. Yeah, I was just the way to get the audience as attention right there at the beginning of the show. No, seriously, why? Why was that pot was open? Why? I started recording on dad as we'd be caught undat in the court. Why? Why? The melody sounds of the voice. Why? And the worst part of it is that it actually went off. I was sitting here thinking, oh, this is going to be great. We're going to have the whole line dropped out. And I can go back to bed for a couple of hours. But I can even skip out and avoid having much with the rumors today. Oh, god. No. Oh, brother. Anyway, let's get to the serious stuff. Okay, we asked you to enter pool on your laundry's.com. This was our second poll of the day after our first poll. And as rummess fell to the center rack. No, it's very close. Oh, brother. Now, he doesn't want anybody to think he's just trying to down some water on those fires and put out all the serious things. There we go. Look, this is some kind of a PR campaign or a talking pony show. Nobody believes that, do they? Oh, good. Because that would only a real cynic would believe crap like that. Now, what is this best of Miami? Yeah, the best of issues out in what? City link. Whatever times. Well, what is this from? That would be a hell. Which one of these are rags? It's from New Times. Best sportscaster, booch zombie. All right. Let's hear it. All right. The Tom Hanks mega hit movie big connected with audiences. Thanks to the actors on Canlly Gile's portrayal of youthful joy. Listening to booch zombie broadcast Florida Marlon's games on WQMA. I'm including the teams unlikely to send to a world serious championship this past season. They won by the way last night. Brought that same feeling to mind. Shombie in old school announced it with an eager to please voice. Yeah, he's really eager to please. So that's so damn glad to be there. It was not it was impossible not to be infected with this enthusiasm. How do you like that? A lot. The opportunity for Shombie to broadcast high profile games must have been a big chance for career enhancement. But what made him list what made listening to him such a joy with an underneath the an answer. You can hear the kid whose dreams were coming true. They like to relax. They be directed to listen about. They be directed to listen about. They like to listen about. About his part of Dave and boring and how terminal he isn't how grateful we are when Boot comes on. And when your his voice is opposed to Dave. Come on, inducing Van Boore. Even Joshua said of that he could have even had to work with him. What? Readers choice was Denise Syphalus. Jimmy Syphalus best sportscaster. Well what does that mean? Jimmy Syphalus? A channel 10? What games does he broadcast? Best TV news anchor also that you can see the way this whole thing is a problem. Horace as it. Cross-eyed Christy Kruger. He spells Cross-eyed with a case. So it's like a triple K ranch. Filming the Oxford's of late local broadcast legend and Bishop of WPLGT was a challenge of accepted by Christy Kruger who has proved herself up to the job at 5, 6 and 11. Maybe her 11 year tenure as health reporter helped to become sufficiently in New or to calmly deal with Mimeys demoralizing Davey news cycle which brims with shootings child of East Yadiyadi. I think like that. I can't read what it says in the bottom of this because you chopped it off. It's on trying to send it in chunks. We got to. That's how scientists are trying to parcel it off. What does it say at the bottom is this? Who is the Readers tour? They're all in the fact machine. What does that mean? They're all spewing out. Here we go. I don't know where I left off. They're all mixed up. Best TV news anchor is right under the boost through there. Christy Kruger, that's their pick now. Oh my God. Oh, that's a lot. Oh, that's a lot. Who? Not a lot. Who the hell's that? They ever watch the Adam family? He's the butler. Lurch? Yes. You're right. Best TV station. That's why New Times is such a pile. Suitable and let's you'll pile of duty, man. Miami-Dade County Cable Television Access Project. That's picked as the best TV station. It says you won't find localized renditions of these sopranos, a lot order on cable tap. But you'll be inundated with half-hour vignettes about the people and organizations that make this sub-tropical, multi-ethnic fine-pandare home. A drone and commissioner may be a culture lightweight for sure. Maybe even a wins-world-level ego-fest. And it goes, oh my God. Patient forum, pausos al-alibretad, pausatodne Puerto Rico, ways of Israel, oeuvay. It says, wow, a TV station that literally can save your ass. Readers choice was Channel 7, which says a lot about South Florida, doesn't it? Absolutely correct. Channel 7. Okay, well, let me just put this stuff aside. There's my Pompano Park copy. I just go and throw you idiot. Did I mention there are sales department or, like, functionally challenged today? Hope they all enjoy that big party tonight. They haven't a ratings party tonight. Folks, I can't tell you where, because then a lot of you, no lives will crash the party. I have no life. But they haven't a ratings party celebrate what a great job they did. It sells the department, all the other people sit around there, pickin' and knows all day. Eatin' the free food, coming in and steaming our free sodas and whatever else we got laying around. Okay, we just do the polries up and miss today first. Which of these vish describes why you listen to the meteorologist, you show Neil, tells it like it is that was a late addition and it's zoomed by everybody else. 733 people under Kiss Me, what on the end? Back home! 733. For a few laughs, 576. To hear the stories Neil raids, 170 to just 9.8 percent. That's not really good old man, you know it. That's not a good sign, less than 10 percent. Too many to hear those free and potent bedtime stories, but you know what? Too bad. It kills four hours of my boring life. I have no life. 133 people honest enough to say that and we can relate, at least when you're in Florida. To hear the crazy and crank call 65, only 3.7 percent, that best, but I hate Neil, but I can't turn it off 46. And to hear the callers opinions only 18, 1 percent. I don't want to say that most of the audience out there doesn't give a fine crap or a fine one either. I don't know if I'm like frying crap. I don't just don't care about your opinions. Of course, that may have something to do with the quality of the calls over the year. But never let's. Okay, so that's yesterday's poll. We got Gabrielle Reese, she's a beach volleyball player in the model. She is? Oh yeah. Well I kind of looked there and we looked too hard for a biographer because when I realized this, she was a volleyball player. I figured, well why does it really make any difference? She's a cross trainer. She's on our behind-the-beaded curtain today. If you're over the ages 75, you got both grandparents around to say, okay, son, you can take a quick look. Then take a look real fast. And by the way, just breaks our heart that we find out that there are people, especially punks, really desperate punks who couldn't get laid in the red light district and an Amsterdam, who are looking at those pictures and not looking at the rest of our prestigious website, like that, spit call we had yesterday, and a little child that overgrown infant, could you be more specific? Yeah. Any of many. Best local sports tournament to Nasdaq 100, best local sports tournament. Oh man, you talk about desperate for categories. Holy moly, the Nasdaq 100. Here's today's poll question. And I think it's a perfect day for it too. I'll let me see what else they got on here. Readers to, oh I see, you're fetching these all out of love. Because you know how it is, it's wide, it's long and wide, and we're trying to get it broken down into faxable chunks. Readers choice, Howard Stern. Best AM, or here you go. Best AM radio, I guess that was best FM, and I can't figure out who it is that they picked because the first part that didn't show up yet. It's there. Best AM radio personality, this is, this has got to be a comedy. It must be because nobody's ever heard of this person. But everybody is, how many people watch that local access TV station if they're raven about that? Bird man. See this is part of the pseudo intellectual approach of new times. Best AM radio personality, Jacqueline Hazel, the forgiveness forecast on WMBM 149DAM. Every Monday wins the infradio afternoon after you finish the full day of terrorizing everyone in your officer shop. You don't have to heat yourself. Sure you've made your secretary's job living hell, you've terminated your codependent girlfriend. You've sedistically tortured your wife. Radio host Jacqueline Hazel as a place in her heart for you. Interactive and broadcasty forgiveness forecast. Hazel count the power saying, sorry. Sorry, Mr. Listen to Hazel on you drive home and you'll feel redeemed and ready to face that deep dark truthful mirror about your bathroom sink. You regain the strength to continue the next day doing the awful things you do and then apologize for. I apologize. Nice way to beat the system Hazel. It's like the phallicism. Do whatever you want, just make sure you get yourself absorbed and what kind of way to make it men's then to apologize. After you finish listening to this uplifting show, readers choice Neil Rogers WDQAM. Of course. How do you like that? Put it in a course. They always pick you. Yeah, what happened to you? Oh, I don't know. What once every 10 years new times, you know, they'll pick me just, oh yeah, the old man's still got it. What was that? That was city length. Wasn't it that glowing ass? I do believe that. What would this time be without the new Rogers show and where will we be? What will we do? Any other audience? New times. Does it hurt? Probably. Yeah. So they're much less likely to say anything positive about me. By the way, Howard Cohen, you're still a class hole. Okay, you idiot. Big one of six doesn't suffer from loss of shock, John. Right. Right. I don't realize you're anything about it. See in a real market where there was real competition and real writers, they'd be ripping the hairl and ass for that because they really rip each other the competition. Same man, oh man, did they make a bonehead mistake? But not Tom, he's too busy telling us about Fraser in the last episode again. How many times has he written about this? I'm good man. By the way, I already got the copy of the chair. One copy was enough, please. 10-13 at 5-60WQM. Let's face it. We've been talking about fast rain for a couponsage on this program now.

No, no, he did not I thought it was great and brought back a lot of memories. Thank you and have a great day and then it says Oh right I don't watch Keralbornet show last night for probably one one reason in particular is when it was on originally like hundred years ago I don't watch it then either I didn't like the Keralbornet show.

So I didn't watch Keralbornet but I sure hope you enjoyed and I'm glad it helped improve your life Let's see rum spell to over there along with these other fakers They're lying through their teeth general miles all these others. Bopopopop Trying to sub big dog and pony show to try to cover up all of this crap And speak of that. It's really interesting now. Who do you believe? Okay? You've got two directly conflicting reports about the Nick bird who was beheaded by the barbarian al Qaeda I thought we got rid of al Qaeda. Isn't that what we've been told or didn't get into the job though? Make it a komper. And I thought also they said that al Zacarwe that it wasn't his voice on the tape by yesterday and then it come to Oya was him That's not yes, yeah, that's not yes, yes, maybe Oh, here's the very disturbing facts is work and I get spinning on the axis of evil I went to Barnes and nobody yesterday. They don't have it. You think borders might well they might I know Amazon probably might that well that's definitely where you'll find it Amazon.com or what's the other one? Amazon.com yeah, and you'll have it a couple of days. I would go online and get it instead of running all over time When you got gas that's 20 bucks a gallon. I wouldn't be wasting all that money. It's a great book. You definitely must read it spinning on the axis of evil You offer a Scott Taylor Anyway, getting back to Nickburg Says the killing a Nickburg the American telephone engineer beheaded by Islamic militants that are racked trigger a political Storm last night is the murdered man's father Lane the Bush administration for the circumstances that led to his death. I should point out right out front the Nickburg voted for who's a Bush supporter? Okay, the kid right Michael Bergen of out of ponen of the war in Iraq said his son might still be alive if the US military had not taken him into custody for 13 days in late March and the brother Nickburg's brother Says you got a whole series of emails that they emailed back and forth So they've got evidence. I mean, there's no question about it that the US military had him in custody Mr. Burr said he believed that if the 26 year old had not been detained so long He might have been able to leave the country of all conditions for more stable Nickburg a travel to Iraq is a freelance telecommunications on a pernoor intending to help rebuild communications antennas But was detained by Iraqi police at a checkpoint in Mosul and a mid-confusion is to what he was doing in the area He was later passed on to the US military who finally now here here's the most important part of this Who finally freed him after his parents sued the federal government for his release on April 5 Mr. Burr said his son of an hell without an attorney was not allowed to make telephone calls Ready for that yeah Typical part of the course or first the government. Oh, no, we we offer to may a pain ride home. We offer to murder Home right We didn't have them in custody. We didn't hang we didn't have force from the state there. I didn't know Godfathers Now if that's the case then how come they sued the federal government and rumsfeld himself for his release April 5 They had to go to court to get them to release him shut up They were just hanging under them just like they do everybody else so well don't ask any questions and forget about the G even convention and forget about attorneys and all this other crap Okay, and this is an American citizen though less who's now dead not even a raghead American citizen or a spik American citizen Exactly Kind of a no head American citizen Well, I mean you said it. I mean that was bad. You're you're responsible for that. I saw where you were going with that. That's bad They should be making it kebab crane jokes. I mean this is not there's not a joking matter. Okay, although I do notice that when Daniel Pearl Is the same thing with him and how come they didn't make a big tinnitus about it as much? They didn't care about it all that much because it wasn't at the time when all these other revelations were coming out when people could say Oh, you see how much more barbaric they are than we are. It wasn't a convenient come back right Oh, look at us see there much more barbaric, but the bottom line is when somebody kills innocent people There's still dead in fact the father said that he was if anything a rather would have had and died the way he did because it's quick and relatively famous as opposed to long And rescoosciating torture and all this other crap After mentioned of course all the thousands and thousands of innocent men moving in children over there who have been dying since we started all the bombing And the shock and awe in a hospital say long torture was painful death without the strep nil in their brain and Of course little Ali who's got the four Our official limbs, it's said on so on and chemical Ali who we killed not only once but twice, it's said of and so on Well, that'll teach them to attack. I mean they just keep lying and lying and lying and a public is the bit of it But it would but I like that Although the latest CBS poll shows that El President days approval rating now keeps dropping like a rock It's down to 44% like a rock So you don't think maybe that's why they're putting on this dog and pony showing back that do you think that might be it? Yeah Or might just be a coincidence WDQAM hello WDQAM hello. Yeah, I knew it's blue. Yes, Lou I wanted to put something on the pole go ahead. Okay. I don't know if it's fine already. Oh, you know you don't But I was just funny the way you said that like like we know you want to show it Well, because everybody calls nobody says I people just want to give you something for the poll And I just want to right at least you're being sociable. That's good. Okay, although unacceptable in South Florida Exactly, but which which brings them the next point which is the Harold the Harold should be on that poll Okay, the crappy Harold the good point excellent choice and and one more thing You know, it's what's funny is the hypocrisy of all these people they're saying oh the Americans don't act like that that's not the Americans we know You know, I think they're wrong. I think this is what Jerry Spirits was an hour certain or I think what they should do is next time There's a documentary on the Vietnam more and look at what we did in me lying all the all the innocent people that we not only Bootsured, but I mean took to body parts of souvenirs They ought to take a look at that. Exactly. Thanks, Tommy. God right there, Lou. Bye. Bye Got it. I'm a Harold Even the fish jump right out of your hand when you try to wrap them in the Harold Peace of crap and let me say it again Howard Cohen you may be fooling somebody else and we know you won't make any correction Retraction but who the how are you people kid? Okay big 106 doesn't lose any listeners with the loss of the shock Jock on all this other crap you would know a shock jack of each stuck his foot right up your ang Right, okay Howard Cohen at the Miami-Herald you idiot you simpleed in you he's probably like you know It's not their 17 year old stringer Do one thing you discover if these newspapers they don't like have like wheeled adults They may have like three or four months that they cost money. Yeah, they had like a bunch of kids that work like They get paid per piece you know kind of like Kathy Willod's they get paid per piece They're like they're just stringers. That's all and you'll notice that one day they're like Who is it the other guy to Glenn? Not Glenn Garbond? Who is it that preceded him? Ken Kevin bastard? What happened to him? But that's right now. He's a sports flunky now. He writes about baseball He was the previous Harold TV radio guy before this Glenn Garbond guy and he didn't know his answer from Our area from the speaker in his radio either Kevin Bastard so all of a sudden just like to probe the years ago What's that was your name that who turned to the religion writer?

Hello Neo yes Hello LnTO buddy beautiful sunny and about 82 today oh Nice Hey real quick you guys talk about lecture Terry. I personally don't listen to them because they're up against Bob and Tom up here Oh, they're related to like disinteri No, but you know what that said of the guy was wrong. They you know they think if they have a decent show They're very funny they're very popular and they're gonna be a hell of a lot better than Ron and What yeah, I mean it right Ron show is his whole show was dedicated to The women and the setting up of the dates and you know it's just it got so lame at the Years I haven't listened to him in a long long time You know you were talking about John Kerry and you know saying where is he and he's not a very strong candidate and I actually have a theory as to Why it is that you're not hearing a lot first of all I think that he realizes that there's so much going on today With the Bush administration that why not just sit back and let them hang themselves More and more In second of all it now you see that that's not the way it works like an aboxing where when your pun starts staggering That's when you got a move in for the kill and he's not doing it You know the ropes and when you let somebody back up off the ropes you know what very often happens don't you? But you're also talking about that the election is still considerably a long way is off It's in November this month and Exactly now in six months you got to look at how much money each candidate has the conference that Bush has is pretty much Stealing over with money There he has to be a very precise with the money that he spends because he only has the fraction of what Bush But Bush has So for him to come out and spend it all now I'm not expecting to spend all the money and advertising right now. I'm just saying when he gets the photo ops And when he's making these speeches he's been to me very very weak very indecisive He's not laying out an alternative for Iraq and he's gonna have to do that Wow, they were talking last night one of the shows about the fact that Nader is drawn five to seven percent in a lot of these states because he's the only real anti-work candidate right now and now Kerry's gonna have to like start sucking around to his position a little bit more because he's just the two two Melee mouth I really think that the hell probably starts taking in high gear Probably about three months from the election because like I said I and I do agree with you as far as him not being a real strong candidate But I'm sure that that scares me no I understand that and I'll tell you what this whole Ralph made of thing I mean that's just disgusting because that man He sees what the condition of this country is and he knows exactly He could testicle jackass. What can I tell you but at the meantime with everything that's going on Kerry's gonna be so far ahead That the Nader fact there shouldn't even make any difference and have a great day thanks 27 after 11 at five 60 WQ and the Obama Amacres can be very confusing so many brands different model names that every store it's almost impossible to compare Plus all those phony sales fall of phony promises with strings attached you really have to be defined print Know what's going on?

What's that you nuts? People I know who I think are reasonable people. I don't think whatever considerate of scene-apportographic sub-cue to a local activist and Vietnam veteran But Gainesville police sergeant Robert Koder thought differently when he saw the poster raise two-day afternoon a busy intersection of University and Northwest 13 street in Gainesville Koder said he had spoken with Kyoto about his sign on previous occasion about two months ago and warned him that the poster was obscene any illegal When Koder approached Kyoto on Tuesday again warned him that his sign was illegal and he would have to lower their vote of jail He didn't even have to walk away. He just had to put the sign away Koder said but Koder said Kyoto refused several times to put his sign away And so he arrested him and transport him to the Alancho County jail Koder said he saw children in passing cars glance at the poster leading him to charge Kyoto exposing minors to have seen material cut of the police report. What a bunch of red necks As you know, we don't have a problem with people exercising their constitutional rights Corporal art actin said, but if there's offensive material that could be viewed by a child, we're gonna take action on it Kiora's lawyer Gainesville criminal offensive attorney Jeffrey Mason, no kin to Perry, city's competent to poster was solely a political statement will not be ruled obscene Though no one of the state attorneys office could be beat for common Mason city doesn't especially Kyoto to be prosecuted He has the first member right to do what he did and it wasn't obscene said Mason who's defending Kiora and be have the Gainesville chapter of the National Lawyers Guild Members of the local chapter of the ACU are not pleased with Kiora's arrest and said they'll discuss the case that their meeting which was yesterday and hopefully they're on it We would most likely see this as an infringement on the right to speak freely and criticize the government the way that this person saw fit said Mark Mayfield Relation to Curtis by chairman of the local ACU having seen the poster many times. I can't understand how that possibly could be deemed obscene on a personal level Kiora said he's received a few complaints about his semides said most people applaud him At a protest in Washington DC Kiora said hundreds of people wanted a picture with the sign I get all kinds of people blowing their horns and give me the thumbs up he said a Kiora said that once his cases resolve he'll be right back out on street corners waving a sign proudly I'm planning on making a bunch of them he said I've got to it's my duty nice going there baby.

What's your number one complaint? That's our poll question today WQM hello Neil yes, sir. How you doing today pretty good? I was just listening to what you're just reading by Marine Dow. She's great. I love her and I'm looking at the polls. You know and I cannot believe I mean I've been watching following politics since I was a teenager I'm like 46 And I've never seen everything this administration has done is gone wrong everything right and there's still 45 40 people Wolk which still support the president everything they have touched has gone bad right they got the minus touching me First everything they touched turns to that and if everything they do everything they say is all in the up and up and good for us Why are they so secretive about everything? You know what they remind me of they remind me of Greg read it QA. I'm just kind of really I'm not seriously they they do everything wrong and at the end of the day they come out smelling like a rose I just don't get it. I don't know if it's the median That's the that's the lead part of it. That's a big part of it if you were watching the CNN the Cable Nazi network right now if you could see the way that they're going on about the great risk that the Bush administration took in sending Rumsfeld in general Myers to a Baghdad and this very I mean just just not I know He can at a tile could see what a dog and pony show what a this but attempted is to save face CNN's not the best but I do I haven't watching Lou Dobbs. I don't know if you watch him at all. Oh He seems fairly fair to me. No, he's not now. You don't think so now the only thing he he lights down to this Outsharsing a job thing and he's made like a whole life crusade out of that, but aside from that he's been a real Bush looker all along And I can't give you a complaint to the pole. Yes, sir that commercial about the flyer drives me absolutely crazy The flyer the flyer Oh It's awful. I don't know who thought that one up, but I can't stand the flyers myself. Maybe try a great day, pal. Take care now. See you go 10th of A baby straight your act ass out That John toward a lenie man. He's got a big mouth 560 pound five 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line Yeah, you should hear the way that they were carrying on him. Oh my gosh the Bush administration taking a great risk And really you know the balls he move a sin all they're trying to do is just cover their ass after this unbelievable 8 or 9 days of embarrassment and of course there's sending people like right wingers like in half and others around All we're outraged by the outrage and the media's covered this too much. Why shouldn't the media cover it so much? My night Shut up. Yeah, exactly. Why now should they be covering it? What would be the only supposed to show all the parades and we mean the right next thing? You know that we show no damn draped coffins again See those of us who live through if he had now we know how the media are we used them and appealing And what about your ass-lickers? They are we know all about that. They're not full on me And then finally when Bush comes to show them finally when the things come out that are really Going on and the motives come out of what this was really all about and they have no more excuse to keep defending the indefesible Then they say oh well wait a minute hold on now. This is bad Just like Vietnam 158,000 kids came home and body bags. I mean what all this business about the humiliation and torture What kind of a society is America become when we have still little regards for human life including our own that's the thing that frost my ass All these kids were sent it over there. They're they're just numbers on a sheet of paper somewhere And then we got more ons like Tom Jick or writing a thing in this question and answer a thing which you'll be out on Sunday It's on the website in the Sun Sentinel Ripping ABC and Ted Koppel for real names are why did they do you know they had the right to do it boy They just tell us what they were doing. Yeah, it was just exploitation. They were just exploiting all those dead kids. I reading their names on there Tom, I'm gonna tell you man. I really ruled the day that I emailed him and got him involved and actually time a couple conversations with Tom Jick I regret that day Because you man are an idiot and your true colors really show there. Oh, yeah, I mean They were trying to get people to tune in and watch well, isn't that what everybody is doing? Is that what you doing? You're right your stupid ass columns about Fraser for going off the year after 800 years the 80 fifth column about Fraser You're trying to get people to open up the paper and read it you idiot But there always has to be some sinister motor behind it. They're trying to make the bush people look bad They're trying to point out something they American people as long overdue that these are real living and reading people with a face in a name With mothers and fathers and wives and husbands and sisters and sons and daughters Real living and reading people not just a name on a piece of paper somewhere Man, oh man, what a mealy moth freaking media. We got in America and that's the only reason that this continues going on. It's pathetic.

It's just come in for the fun The immigrants are the best at Walmart they clean our toilets practically for free and Walmart I don't need no stink in green card. We don't need no budgets. I don't have to shut you on a stinkin Vashes it's like my morning We're taking drinks out being like every Walmart Publishing basically repeat pictures. I saw today Virtually the same soldiers who we've seen over and over again until we can recognize them individually Simply doing more of the same. All right. Let me get a different perspective Dennis Gocenic Please is joining us as well The bill your face to a lot of our viewers. He was maybe still is a democratic presidential candidate But go ahead and respond to what the chairman just said. Well, I think it's absolutely chilling To assert that somehow the media is to blame here. I mean, I heard Secretary Rumsfeld a moment ago tried the media for the images the pictures the video clips I mean This war was a lie from the beginning Secretary Rumsfeld appeared before this to hunters committee and basically lie to the Congress About saying there were weapons of mass destruction, which are the reason why we're there I mean when are you going to call the secretary to an accounting for the for the lies that he told in front of your committee This this whole thing has been about a pattern of deception and right now what they're doing They're trying to blame the media get that I mean the media just carried the information forward when the administration said no There were weapons of mass destruction now to try to do what we respond is that We're blaming we're blaming the media for putting out pictures when they were asked on this specific occasion with Americans in danger Not to put pictures out to could cause hostages to be harmed the media They old to to to to refrain from doing that from restraining themselves and we had a bad result Well, let me let me interrupt her second was for German. I think you refer to the Communist CBS man, they did delay the their their program as they reviewed the request from the do this is the way they play the game Because it is on our rule here. He's ripping him and ask right and now we got a change of topic because we'll Scutt some stupid as quick as when it came out of the people who killed a Mr. Burg in this very brutal fashion laid at least part of the cause As a result of of seeing those pictures and responding to the pictures that the media did put out I think they should have delayed those pictures from going out forever and I think the other part of this story here is that They should deleted forever the politicians didn't get involved in fact the US Army as you now know Wolf With no politics. Come on out here and anything from Dennis Cassinitz investigated themselves starting on January 16 and Walk down through this series of six investigations to the point where court marshals are now starting for criminal activities for this small handful of bad apples They are getting this thing about this is that you know here's secretary rum spell going to Iraq today Why wasn't he in Iraq when he reports first started to come out? You know what's happening here? It's the old story that they're gonna go after the people at the Service level and the uniform level when the guys at the top will responsible for the policy of sending the troops out of begin with are going to escape Scott free He's not a law and I think that I think that every American is offended by this attempt to try to Put the responsibility on the troops and not put it on the people are responsible right in the White House and at the secretary level Congress would stand by we have a lot more to talk yeah, we have a lot more a wop you're an idiot Okay, if they ought to drag him off just like they'd ragdoward be galop the screen and that work right all of he was telling the truth They ought to come in here and drag both bloodscree go off the set right now and let Cassinitz go on until to a clock and we carry it He is the only one the only one him and sharpening of course We know about sure well, but of the of the relatively rational people He was the only one who really told it like it is no holds barred and all the lies all the BS looks this guy right in the face How come you're not investigating rum spell for making up the stories and line about weapons and mass destruction getting us into this bogus war in the first place Got ya, yaddi yaddi yaddi ladies are right there on the line while John carries running around go and look at the like that And it's got how many votes did he get? That's not just in one primary. That's all the states put together. That's how many votes Cassinitz got about 30 Cause he had a bad hairpiece now. He's got a better hairpiece. I think it's too late He would be great You can you see him debating bush? Oh, please he would slice him up man. They're just like You would never seen yeah, but how is he gonna respond to push that they did 560 560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line what's your number one complaint? I'll tell you what my number one complaint is I want to add this on here right now. You know what it is The media sucks a American media sucks put that on there right away Josh you're not gonna make a division you American media sucks God are they pathetic and there's a classic example He let this right wing our Republican goofball from California on there to chairman of that committee He let it who by the way was making all those glorious speeches together today Just kiss and rummels for those ass he let him go on for like about 90% of that time and a sus cassana started telling like it was All right, but I mean, but I'm up and how go about CBS did delay You know we're changing the question changes subject anything you take away time from cassana Who's telling too much truth and making too much sense you grave robbers you at the cable Nazi network? There is a reason they are the problem Because they're the enablers just like that thing about Christian. I'm on poor. I'm so motivated I'm gonna read that one page again From Scott Taylor's book about Christian. I'm on poor net that stage diventa They did that made for TV event. Yeah Never was the media truth Mormon if you later during the stage statue tapping scene on April 9 It was meant to symbolize the end of Sodom's regime Watching CNN senior correspondent Christian. I'm on poor give a live report on these supposedly spontaneous incident I suspect that this would be one of the U.S. largest stage news events What a coincidence for I'm on poor and are crew to be on hand in photo square to capture on video Amaba to rack you's that they tried to bring down large statue of Sodom I'm able to achieve this feet alone a detachment of U.S. Marines just happened to be in the area to lend the hand I listened in credulously as I'm on poor told CNN viewers That this was bagged at central square and that this particular statue was deeply symbolic to the Iraqi people As furno squirre sits between the Sheraton and the Palestine hotels I was very familiar with it contrary to our claims furno square certainly was not the center of Baghdad The real center Revolution square was some two kilometers away and was still very much under the control of Sodom loyalist further This particular statue was cast from a standard mold and Identical copies could be found all over Iraq in fact up to the previous October when the statue had been erected furno square But nothing more than an empty traffic circle When other media outlets housed in the Palestine hotel began broadcasting images of these statues toppling They actually provided a different perspective by pulling back from the action it became obvious that the Iraqi mob was in fact just a tiny crowd American tanks completely surrounded the square so the Iraqis were operating inside a protected perimeter One Iraqi who camped it up for the cameras by banging issue on the toppled Sodom was later recognized to be one of Ochme Chilabbi's INC bodyguards two days earlier the same individual wearing the same shirt had appeared beside the Iraqi National Congress president when he returned to the town of Mesovia As became clearly evident the incident at furno square had been orchestrated by the US military and conjection with CNN The cable Nazi network Water would certainly not full Iraq citizens that effectively commenced North American audiences that the war was over During that evening's news cast global television anchor Kevin Newman interview correspondent Patrick Graham one of the few Canadian reporters would stuck it out and bag that From the Palestine hotels rooftop Graham explained how this Particularly incident had involved only a handful of Iraqis He went on to say that in reality the petty infighters still control most of Baghdad nevertheless The following morning virtually every North American headline read Sodom toppled and CNN had switched its war in Iraq logo to a new Iraq rebuilds Instead of waiting for the Iraqis to rise up on mass to celebrate their so-called Liberation the Bush administration of the side of the time was right to start celebrating for them a stage TV event to brainwash a manipulate the American public opinion and very successfully and easily done you ask him any questions you want and we had and when I said I don't want to just have one city and I want to have multiple cities We had multiple briefings where members could ask you to be like what's in England? I had multiple organs when they made a decision to go to Iraq they did it as as Members of Congress who understood and who had been informed and we had vast turnout We had a majority of the house come down and they got their own information so the idea is somehow They came in and Don Rumsfeld told them to all go vote for the war and they did that is Is not accurate. Let me just say This about the secretary the secretary I think stuck Dennis under the chair Well Sanchez has done this by the book Three days after the soldier came forward now he's raven about the great job They're rich Sanchez is doing the case and you now know that that they announced that to the combined audiences of CNN In this MVC and Fox so outside of 50 million people they kept his secret They walked down through these investigations and they have criminal prosecution starting right now But once again wolf the number is 6 and not now I think it's been expanded to 7 and most members who have seen these pictures say how come we see that same little group of people In almost every picture and there hasn't been a link Where it between the White House or the Pentagon or something I think it's important chairman may have forgotten what Mr. Rumsfeld said because maybe it's not six maybe it's one Listen to this quote and this is right to his testimony to your committee He said talking about who's saying that who's saying has at this moment stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and his pursuing nuclear weapons His regime has an active program to acquire and develop nuclear weapons very likely all they need to complete a weapon It's physomaterial and they are at this moment seeking that material both from four sources and a capability to produce it Indig<|pl|>ously now if that's not a lie. What is it? I think that's largely accurate in my statement with the same time if you saw that I got to call him if you saw if you saw that Dennis my statement at the same time was you could put the entire 8500 leaders Anthrax material in one pickup truck I mean the idea that that was going to be sitting on on a in a parking lot waiting for us to come pick it up What I told people a year ago, we're not gonna have Congressman unfortunately We got to do commercial break in a lot of time and the music swell something in background. This is CNN Wow You see how many words he let him say there percentage Because we every time somebody starts blurtin the truth out. We got to cut him off. We got into ruptured time for commercial It will just gotta go take a crap something's going on man. We got it erupt Truthus interrupters that's the American effin way make no mistake about it I got kind of sidetracked every you on pad I did No Chris Cassin is his great. He doesn't mince his words. He may mince a little bit But he don't mince his words and he doesn't beat around a bush and he just tells it exactly the way it is. He does beat around on the bush I's gone Dennis.

B. has not to show the whole national We're Mr. you would have his heart set on showing that taste this I understand that but I'm asking you nicely the first I'm afraid we can't help you What's that What's that What's that What's that 305 60 WM Mad Dog at two the Humper from Baltimore in the Prickness at four wait till you hear this Okay sit on the easier seat hold your breath The family firm of beheaded American Nickburg was named by a conservative website An a list of enemies of the wreck occupation that could explain as a rest by a rocky police at attention Which fatally delayed his plan return from Iraq and may have led directly to his death Nickburg 26 disappeared into income in a caro detention after his arrest by Iraqi police in March 2004 He vanished again after his release 13 days later his body was found by a Saturday and Baghdad in the video of his beheadings Supposedly by a radical Islamic group was posted on the internet Tuesday The official story of his gruesome murder is many dubious aspects not to least the real reason why Iraqi police Detendio Man in the checkpoint new research by break for news is uncovered a plausible explanation The free republic dot com website and form as a reputation for right-wing views Fanatic or Republicanism and relentless pro-war activism on March 7 2004 just three weeks before the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq and enemies list of anti war groups and individuals was posted on the free republic form and began Here you are free purse here is the enemy The list have been copied from publicly available endorsements of a call to action for an imminent anniversary anti war protest on March 20 2004 the protest was being organized under the banner of the answer coalition act now to stop foreign and racism Among those letters having endorsed the call to action was this entry Michael S. Burg teacher Promethias methods tower service ink that's Nickburg's father Michael Oax is a business manager for a son their family waiter communications firm from atheist method tower service Both father and son care deeply about Iraq, but they were on opposite sides of opinion on the occupation Though you would never know that for meeting the New York Times Michael was ardently anti war where his voice supporting son was in favor of the word of the extent that he had already visited Iraq seeking to help with rebuilding efforts Just seven days after Michael Burg and Promethias methods tower service had come up On that Iraq war enemies list his son Nickburg returned Iraq onto the business name of Promethias methods tower service The scene was set for tragically mistaken suspicions which were to end in the horrifying death of an honorable and blaneless American A humanitarian who had traveled several times to third world countries such as Ghana to teach villagers construction techniques The web traffic to the freeber public forum and its four membership includes significant numbers of serving in former U.S. military Many members take their online activism very seriously Summed a light and causing mischief for those they think are identified as enemies Within minutes of getting their hands on the anti war names one was both thinking of having contact to the military about Active service personnel who were on the list I forwarded the list to the ISE the command you listed the district officer the district legal office and the investigative Services office the response the poor moron is not gonna know what hit him is this being mean spirited? No someone against our military does not belong in the military Another was already investigating a member of the Coast Guard on the list I took a look at this Yahoo and he has a site which is not real fun to the war on drugs or the war on terrorism that particular Coast he needs some serious trouble to come his way Another one I spoke on the phone with senior chief yesterday in Virginia who cannot believe what the guy was doing Who was both a stouted in angriot he's in for some big big trouble If that list could end up on an internet form there could just as readily end up with the FBI And eventually the hands of those in Iraq war keen to track or harass anti war activists entering the country Alternatively the enthusiasm free republic had the contacts in the clear determination to have ensured the list quickly got to the right places At the time the list was posted Nick Berge just come back from an Iraq trip Lasting from late December to February 1nd and reported no problems whatsoever with Iraqi police during that visit here within the two inch of the list being posted Nick Berge back on Iraq on his final fatal trip was reportedly detained in Mosul and an Iraqi police checkpoint The official explanation is that the 30 stouted identification might have been forged and were checking his authenticity But a more likely reason is that by then the 30s in Iraq had discovered that a burger from atheist method stouter service was in the country Initiated tension instruction Iraqi police because they misidentified Nickburg is an anti war activist entering Iraq to work for the enemy That could explain why he was held in comminocato for 13 days without recourse to a lawyer Why US official them was singularly on heating of his mother's please? By the FBI visit his family to question them why it took a US court order secured by the family to pressure his release And why he was cruelly murdered soon after that release like many others around the world of suppers such a fate at the hands of state condone death squads Sometimes just hours after the release from official detention that's the final sorted twist in this grizzly story If the world was an uncomplicated place then this tale would end with a mistake in arrest of Nick Bird We could finish by noting that next father's reportedly accusing US government of contributing to his son's death Unable to find working Iraq Nick bird's last trip was said to be a short one he planned to return to the west on the 30th of March Michael Berg charges that his son's detention for April 5 was a violation of civil rights Which fatally delayed his ex ex if from Iraq and said left him dangerally stranded in the middle of the explosion of violence which rupted early April 2004 But there are much greater aspects to all of this another chilling perspective is best summarized by the war cynicism of Michael Rivera And what really happened calm In a commentary on the beheding of Nick Bird Rivera rights how wonderfully lucky for Bush and the neocons that such a great piece of pro-war distract from the Torture scandal event happens at this particular moment Rivera's world where we realism struck secord with his popular websites visitors But will undoubtedly shock unseasoned observers However he is far from alone in questioning the official line others have noted the two white hands and military At East Stance of the hooded captors in the video The killing is certainly ease the international discomfortsure of the US the problem with assumptions that al Qaeda's Responsible for Burz beheding is that Musab al Zikari is mentioned in the cow caption on the video tape of the killing Al Zarkawi came to our attention in January 2004 when the US military claimed of intercepted letter of his written to the al Qaeda leadership But the content of letter were lucky US military propaganda statement on the situation in Iraq In the letter al Zarkawi wrote of Iraqis coming to welcome the US presence in Iraq and how about how al Qaeda was losing ground and swore against the US In February 2004 an article Tiedled these are cow again but by Greg why her on counter punch was deeply skeptical of the letter If you were Carl Roe if you couldn't design a better scenario to validate the administration's plan on the war than this That's a good reason to maintain a healthy skepticism in fact. There are a good reason to take this day with a grain of salt maybe three or four pounder The US has been keen to paint the opposition to the occupation as composed of many foreign fighters Tiedou al Qaeda The letter was clearly fabricated for propaganda purposes with al Zikari is its new al Qaeda star But if al Zikari is merely a flimsy propaganda creation Then what if what confidence can we have in the official line that al Zikari and al Qaeda murdered bird? The only possible alternative is a covert black operation orchestrated as part of the CDR arm of US foreign policy Which generally only come to light when candid photographs for example reach the public domain But that's an explanation which many would reject on the grounds that no force alive to the US no matter how black its operations Would have members so calluses to even countenance the cold blooded be hitting of US citizen However, there's a mindset amplified by war passions and fought among the gung-hobe roots who beat Iraqis to death fought among the thugest mercenary debt squads who roam to slay at will and fought among the cold blooded sociopaths who applied at bombs for political strategic reasons Its war and war begins a wartime mindset Nick burges the attention and the case that the authorities regarded him as an anti-wraactiveist and possibly also an enemy That original post on freeber public contains a telling indication of a mindset which in the heat of war could well kill an American regardless of the enemy A mindset which is now reacted to Michael Burges loss of his son like this. I wonder what he thinks about his Muslim buddies now A mindset displayed by such keywords used on freeber public to categorize the list of anti war supporters the keywords are a piece next Dan comics enemy within let this piece next rats scumbags Traders treasonous dot com use the idiots and war on terror And yes, we did use the one word because it's in a new story and you better not have nothing I waited a month He's reach a port It was a it's a new story.

I think it was that debate between that right now lunatic from California Dennis Cassinach It was that the so-called debate in which should they let Dennis say about 10 words And then of course the net story that I just breathlessly found on the drugs retort that's with two teas and This one from the nation exporting America's prison problems by Dan Prosh In 1997 a 29 year old schizophrenia inmate named Michael Valente was stripped naked and strapped to restraining chair by Utah prison staff Because he refused to take a pillow case off his head shortly after he was released some 16 hours later Valente collapsed and died from a blood clot that blocked an artery to his heart The chilling incident made national news not only because it happened to be videotape It also because Valente's family successfully sued the state of Utah and forced it to stop using the device Directed the Utah Department of Corrections Lane McCotter who was named in the suit and defeated use of the chair resigned in the ensuin firestorm some six years later Lane McCotter was working in obbo grave prison part of a four-man team of correction advisors sent by the justice department and charged with a sensitive mission of reconstructing Rax notorious prisons ravaged by decades of human rights abuse While McCarter left her back shortly before the current scandal dogbo grave began and says he had nothing to do with the MPs of community atrocities is Very present there raises serious questions about US handling of the Iraqi prison system It's bad enough that the justice department picked McCotter who's reputation in Utah was at best controversial in a worthless disturbing But further the justice department hired him less than three months after its own civil rights division release date Shocking 36 page report documenting in human conditions that he knew Mexico jail run by the company where McCotters and executive Here was a man whose prisons have been played by reports of in-made miscreament for nearly a decade Lane McCard is administration here at a horrifying record on human rights so Carol canod in 2002 Indeed around the same time Michael Valentei jens the Anderson then lawyer for the group interview close to 40 mentally Illmate inmates who had also been restrained in the chair. We found out they were being kept there for far longer than necessary Says Anderson There were cases where inmates ended up sitting in their own feces. They were being tortured Shortly after Valente family went to court the ACLU filed a lawsuit against three Utah DOC doctors this time for Vinding a mentally ill man naked save his underwear to a stainless steel pallet called the board for 85 straight days That case was said a lot of court-acorned newspaper reports Generally under McCotters ruled human rights were not respected notes Anderson after he left things improved a great deal But there were soon to become worse in Santa Fe, New Mexico where County officials decided that our management and training corporation a Private Utah based corrections company to run its jail McCotter was it happened now worked as MTC's director of corrections business development In August 2001 McCotter won secretary of corrections in a Mexico travel to Santa Fe to finalize MTC's three-year contract to operate the Santa Fe County detention center Less than a year later a team of justice department correction experts was inside the Santa Fe jail investigating civil rights violations In March 2003 they reported included that certain conditions violated inmates constitutional rights and that inmates suffered harm of the risk of serious harm from among other things Wokeful deficiencies in health care and basically big conditions The report documented numerous and horrifying examples and threatened a lawsuit of things didn't get better amid the fallout The justice department pulled it's approximately a 100 federal prisoners out of Santa Fe and MTC fired its warden and pressured its medical subcran tracker positions network association who acts one of its medical administrators Then on May 20th in a case of unfathomable irony attorney general John Ascroff denounced them a cotter along with three other corrections experts had gone to Iraq The very same day just this department lawyers began their first negotiations with Santa County officials over the extensive changes needed at the jail of a board legal action The justice department will come at a wide-chose Macotter whose company has been hounded by well-publicized and ongoing health care security and Personnel problems at many of the 13 prisons and operates in the US Australian Canada Meanwhile the Ontario Provincial Government is currently investigating an inmate death and MTC's Canadian prison on May 5 and Inquest in the three other mysterious deaths over the patch you're expected according to an article in the very examiner In a May 7 statement Macotter emphasized that he was mainly in Iraq to oversee the structural renovation of Iraqi prisons And a trainer Raki citizens for correctional duties he stated that there were no inmates at Abu Grey while he was there and that he never supervised military personnel According to Gary Delane also remember the correctional team in raccoz predecessor with Utah DOC The two of them worked along with him pedal Brigadier general Janis Carpinsky and MPs from various battedans But that none of the faces on television look for mid-year Delane says the justice department paid him 8500 bucks a month while he was in Iraq before bumping a salary up to 12 grand a month For the end of the four month trip he defend some of Cotter is one of the very best correction administrators ever met Judy Green a prison reform consultant disagrees There are any number of questionable administrators active or retired that had good records in whom I would have rather seen tap by the justice department for this kind of assignment The Cotter was no expert in how prisoners should be treated or how prison staff should be trained Interestingly Chase Reveland former secretary of corrections both in Washington and Colorado The Green says is respected both by prison reformist and correction administrators turned out an offer to join the justice department's team The philosophies of the individuals that were going did not match mine Reveland told the nation While it seems unlikely Lane Macotter was involved in the unfolding abuse scandal Abu Grey his hiring given his trouble history In current employment at equally troubled MTC is yet another example of the unending and unabashed Bumbling of the occupation perhaps most important if this is the type of personnel decision we can expect from critical agencies like the justice Department there's probably more scandal to come and I would say I'd like that Just like this general Jean Miller It was transferred from a gitmo over to Iraq No, it is the Lunatic of Gimmol how can you say that a few people to give them all at gitmo more punishment or abuse?

Okay, she coming with a mouthful of soda. Oh five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line Oh, I was pleased to see even though of course it only made a little blip for dare to Remember the story I had a couple of days ago about the School for the death in Boston right and the big scandal about that about the nuns that abused and molested and tortured and Oh, just in horrendous things to all those poor kids and now they sued a lot of these people sued They actually headed on the end elder cable news networks there for a little while, you know how many times did we see it? About one or two as opposed to everything else that we see at least 20 years times but it was on there Just another example. Another one of these many isolated incidents see when you're dealing with these sexually frustrated neurotic people Priest nuns all of these people tried to live this very unnatural life They wound up doing a lot of very unnatural grotesque things what a shock Yeah, it's just like during war all of these grotesque horrendous things happen because generally the whole concept of war and killing other people Especially when they didn't attack you in the first place is sick and twisted to begin with Well, I ran those planes into them So it's amazing really when you come right down to it and let me also just point out that the same rum spell when they asked him this morning at that Dog and pony show they put on whether all the pictures should be released. He said yes if we're up to him But then again the legal eagles have to look through it. Yeah, but if we work them that a shawl should be released And then here we had that debated with Cassinuts and other there a wacko and he's going out about well, you know, they shouldn't permanently be Put away somewhere nobody should be able to see him Because that's the excuse now for a Nick Burr getting his head chopped off and it's the excuse for anything else that's gonna happen Of course they didn't even excuse to chop off Daniel Pearls head but don't confuse people with the facts So they've already said that all the pictures ought to be released But isn't it something that there's all of this moral outrage About the torture and the humiliation and degradation of the Iraqi person is most of whom 79 and 1990 Percent a more rested by mistake didn't do a damn thing another course. They all there but they're terrorists. Yeah, right right but The 16,000 civilians who've been mained and killed and those all these things Nobody's even talking about them.
