Why do you ask her? She said she showed them her ripples in laces and white blood beat dark. She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children, so they would not spin. While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling, rep you sand litter from yesterday's hunt. While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her, I'd at the fellow, down by the dock. In the black-up man with a side-up hole home in the country with a big fence out front. If he asked her, unlikely she'd show him her little bet-dog who was subject to fit. And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender as with a movement so quick. And then she'd bend over and suck down his candy so tasty made of butter, sky. And then he spread whipped cream all over her cookies that she had left out on her shelf. If you think this is dirty, you can go f*** yourself. Amen! 10-02 at 5-60 WQM happy Friday March 12th. We just missed the March 13th, I am Friday 13th by a day. Allah. And the way things have been going is probably a good thing. Probably a dang good thing. Several fashes on the joint March situation. I just want to chastise some of my colleagues on QAM for two things. Number one, I don't find anything I'm using about the fact these guys got candid blown out. Number two, I don't take any satisfaction in the fact that there are other people who are like, kind of like, vultures being dangled over waiting to be put in that slot. Because I think the joint March situation may just be revisited in days very near or to come. And number two, it's just amazing to me. And like I said yesterday about CNN with this Todd Bertuzzi hit on Steve Moore. The people on our radio station, Gueldia, Spooned and Gueldia's been out sick or whatever last two days. He's not even on. So if you take all the sports there is on our station and put them together, what they know about hockey, you could stick in grid reads. Back though, I've room for the Chinese army left over in there, okay? But all of these people, well they all got an opinion in Todd, but they wouldn't know Todd Bertuzzi from Todd Dread. That's the mood. But certain people on the station are absolutely... Who is seriously a boy at hockey and think that it blows all of a sudden got a big mouth. But I don't think they're experts. Pick up, I watch more hockey in one night than the collected group, taking Gueldia side because he's not there last couple of days. The whole rest of these sports nerd group on that radio station in a year. Because they're not one of them that watches one complete game in a single year. Am I right? Absolutely. In fact, I think George is more on top of it, only because of rubbed off from this show. Well, Tom rather than wanted to, but he couldn't control it, you know, and no cheers. 1554 votes on yesterday's pool and a wide field whipped up to a frenzy today. You know, I just really do. Good. It's a good Friday. I do. Well, I give you a book, your frenzy would just a bill. Yeah, we'll show it. Now, aren't you sure you're going to again? Can there are some ignorant people out there? Would no Jessica be ill from Howard Beale? I'm a murder! I don't know what I'm going to say to you, but I don't know what I'm going to say to you. So get yourself an education or before I do the pool, even here's a little background. What I'm going to try to do each day when we have our sunshine, you're all behind the beaten curtain. It's behind the beaten curtain. You must be a team to take a puke at it. Okay? Don't be able to still crap. You better be a team. You better take a look at John Aschroff's push because he's watching. He's monitoring you. Anyway, Jessica Beale was born March 3, 1982, so she's 22 and nine days. Perfect. Got it? Yeah? 22 years old and nine days. Fresh. Oh, by the way. Yes, not Jennifer Beale's. Who's someone else on the outward, you know, famous and, uh, been a... Did I say Jennifer Beale? No, but when I was talking about her before people were confusing Jessica Beale. With Jennifer Beale? With Howard Beale? Yeah. She was born in Elym and a soda raised in border conalirators. She's five foot eight, her nickname is Jesse. Jesse Beale. Uh, it would seem natural for her to play the classic girl next door rules. However, the star of a kind of career in teen model prints after being discovered at 1994, Imtha Convention has struggled to break out of the confines of the good girl Persona. Her breakthrough came when she was cast in Aaron Spelings, WB production 7th heaven as Mary Camden, old at 7th heaven, Manhattan, Oman. There's something for everybody in that show. Although she gained considerable attention for a work on a show she began increasingly frustrated with her role, blaming her saintly image for the loss of leading role that American beauty to throw a birch. Teating her character in the series was willing to film career despite a role in a claimed drama OOE's gold, Beale attempted to get out of her contract when a pre-produces refused Beale turned to gear magazine where she posed, stark naked. Oh no. The controversial cover in Photos spread. Can I say spread? No. The photo. The controversial photo. Result in relieving the TV series by mutual consent. Unfortunately, Beale's film career did not take off as quickly. Only as she had hoped and she frequently opposes a guest on 7th heaven. And let's see. Goes on with a list of summer for her. She excited and terrified moviegoers last fall with her portrayal of leather faces greatest domestic state as Aaron and new line productions remake of Texas chainsaw massacre. Having just finished re-filming blade trinity, in Vancouver with Wesley Snatcher-Rion Reynolds and Chris Christopheerson, she's recently transported to intensely cut and trained body of a vampire hunter killer to Australia to fill the uniform and project the integrity of one of the film's first female jet fighter pilots in Columbia Sony Pictures new film, stealth 2005. Would Josh Lucas Damie Fosson Sam Shepherd. Oh my god, it's a turf film career began in age 14 when she played alongside Peter Fond and his gold globe winning performance U.L.s gold. Other film credits include I'll be home for Christmas. The summer catch rules of attraction which is just fabulous. Summer catch and I just said that and the cellular. Did you say catch? Summer catch is what I said okay catch rhymes with patch. Hey and do a latch. Anyway, net. Fifteen hundred plus of votes on the poodle yesterday. What butchered word or phrase bugs you the most really just lost your fat ass. Axe your fat acts. Let me ask you a question instead of ask 766. It really that I mean there's nothing even close.

What do you think was the best remake of a hit song? I like that. I mean, they probably won't like it because they always hate my music. But does that have to be my music or you music? Anyone they like? I'll talk about taste. Right. I only put three on here to start. Locomotion by Grand Funk Railroad. Locomotion by Kylie Minogue, which we played a little yesterday.

Very everybody in the stations got their pants down around her ankles. Waiting for the big kiss. That's a good one. Oh, man. What a job. WCWM. Hello. Yes, sir.

So we're going to get hand to the virgin Mary. Would it come just swoop it in there and black them bullets? Damn it. Now that I think of it was there. One bullet or more than one bullet.

We got Jim Sarny who wants to join Mark Badger. Jim Sarny says free, Joe and Mark. Oh, I was going Jim. I'm starting to like Jim Sarny a little bit because he's not on the payroll. I mean, we got to, you know, newspaper people on a payroll, right? Yeah, the most. Yeah, yeah. But unfortunately for us, Jim Sarny, Amy on the QM payroll, like very jackass. He's not just a mouthpiece for Greg Reed. So he actually writes his opinion once in a while. Nice going Jim. Free, Joe and Mark, we'll get to that. We got Tom Jico as more comments about how we're the stern master. In fact, speaking of Howard Stern, he threatened the quit of Bush signs the indescribable, which passed 1951 to 22 in the house yesterday. And now the Senate's got to finger that out and believe you me, Bush will sign it. He had a call on his show yesterday from Congressman Gary Accomand said that Bush would not sign a bill while Gary, I hate to break the news to you. He's foaming it the mouth way in the sign it. He's got the pen ready right now. He's got the old not the ballpoint pen. He's got that old ink pen. You know, the one that would have been a big deal. The ball, the quill. Oh, he's got one of those. That's right. That's how excited he is. Good way to sign that so they can pick it all of us off the year. That's right. Hello, have a nice day and we'll play some nice soothing music.

I'm just, if he wants me to sing God bless America and face these in a jeep, bring up here. I'll do a man. Just sign them checks. Make sure they clear the bank like the one I showed up on Wednesday and that's it. Everything's just fine. You know what I mean? Oh, we're fine. Right. Because you can't fight city hall. But if you do want to fight city hall, you can go to neo-wrages.com and there's a neat thing on there that Eric put on there from somebody else. I know who we got that from. Casey J. J. Oh, that's that station. I will, right? That is. Oh, they're free speech at dawn.

I know I'll need to do it. I don't think so. Just couldn't be one of those cases where they don't understand the question again. They definitely don't understand the question. We're not talking about a song that somebody wrote like for example, Love will keep us together by the Captain and Slamila was written by Nelson Acca. I mean, the fact that he wrote it and of course that's something album he did. He's saying it himself. But that's, they don't get it. In other words, here's the deal. What do you think was the best remake of a hit song? See, there's the operative phrase of a hit song. In other words, the song that was hit the first time, and then somebody came along and we done it. Did Neil Sedakau? I'm just using that as an example. Did he have a hit on level keep us together? No. Good example. Good example. Good answer. You see, FDFCC, which we say amen, and then he says, being in the title business, I come across these expressions every day, or words, after David, and there's a post-Affid David, and statue of limitations has opposed to statute of limitations.

Five, six, seven, five, six, six, six, six. Then she'll be aggravated. How am five, six, six, six, six on a A-NUSI that's terrible. Don't be saying stuff like that. Don't really slap around too much. Just a little tiny bit. Give her a tongue lashing. There you go. Oh, oh, see there we go again. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was not when you used it. I believe it was not a part-and-not a part-and-not a part-and-not a part-and-not a part-and-not a part. Dali Parkans, I've got always love you, uh, I did it first. Okay. You've got to come 45 facts to send the same. Thanks, pal. Okay. Don't do it again. Okay. So it is legit. Dali Parkans saying it first. And of course, that must have been big. I got to play that, gotta play a little bit of that locomotion again after the break. Just a little bit of tiny bit of, I love Kylie Monogue. I'd like to. You know, like Kylie Monogue? That's a joke. I'd like to love her. I know that, but I mean, it's just, uh, I get a word for her. We give that a-ah! Jesus Christ Almighty, man. Jesus Christ. I guess I can cancel all my vacations from now on. Good. God Almighty. Here we go. Just a little tiny, a taste. Oh, see now I'm going to do it. Ha ha ha ha. How do that? Ha ha ha ha ha. How do that? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Everybody's doing the band. That's mad. Oh, my God. I know you get to that game. You get to that game. You get to that game. Now you don't whelts to that Casey and a sunshine band and whelts. Oh, no, I gotta look at that. Why did I do this today? This is Friday and I'm making too much work for my show. Casey and a sunshine band. You remember that? We used to play that I would be.

And if I look at local motion won't be in there because it wasn't a hit. So at any rate, uh, that's another example. Cocaine by Eric Clapton. Who did the original? Uh, I don't know. I'm going to look it up. Better not be wrong about that rich. Is that rich, Packter? Yeah. It's all in the big fat piece. Oh, yeah. There's, there's nobody else listed about a cocaine. I don't know.

Who's around me? He keeps on running. Who's your peek and see the victory coming. 1047 at 560 WCM. Very jackass. The mouthpiece for WQM and Greg Reed. I think it's Greg Reed's illegitimate son. Right in a hero today. One station walks on air. It has been a thoroughly un-adventful 11 days of the WQM Zoo. Unless of course, you count Hank Goldberg's high-edits to parking lot incident that led to it. Four firings. Rumors of a Howard Stern pursuit and a scandal involving pictures of WQM host Mark Eisenberg and Joe Castella with naked women popping up on the internet. But you know what? No matter what controversy misfortune be false WQM, Fox Sports Radio 940 never capitalizes. And even though local businessman Carl Fosterman sits close to finalizing a deal with the SPN Radio to bring a third-all sports station to the Miami-Forelobe deal market, keep this in mind. Nobody has legitimately challenged WQM yet, and at beginning to think it's never going to happen despite the nuttiness that goes on there. All WQM has had challenges but they've been half-hearted at best. First, there was Tony Kent how Colata Yudes, ill-fated and ill-financed 1700 to fan, which couldlder writes any of the local teams and switches to Spanish religious programming. Then WRFX 940 came along, but parent company cleared channels only local pro team to heat was so unimpressed, and insisted its games here on sister station WQM, which otherwise doesn't carry sports. WRFX is talking with a game but don't be fooled, its priority is making money. That explains the cheap syndicated line up that features only two hours a day hosted by an actual employee Jorge Sedano, like his supermarket's though. You pre-occupation with the bottom line is why WRFX sold its morning show to foster until January, and our simultaneous Dan Salayo show for out of Orlando during that day part. Just as Sedano was beginning to develop a following, WRFX sold its valuable 3-6-PM block to the highest bitter, Zeta personality Greg Lamega, and former WRFX morning co-host John Weener, Stu Gats. They begin Monday, will face long rods and drunken listeners from Jim Mendes and Goldberg who returned to the year on Tuesday. Stu Gats. Nothing against Lamega and Weener, but it's difficult to take all sports stations seriously when it doesn't even use its own employees for the key acting in drive time. Sedano was good enough to be hired by Fox Sports Radio for a weekly national show, but apparently did not, though, not valued not by his bosses to get the 3-6-Lot of 940, instead he's been relegated to the 6-8-PM slot, which is difficult to understand. WRFX could have made a splash by having former dolphin linebacker Brian Cox, who impressed his rookie studio analyst on ESPN 2 last season, and has expressed interest in doing a talk show locally, or WRFX could have made a run at WRQM's Orlando Elzagiri, the big- Oh, who's opinionated well prepared, but those options would have been costly. Oh, who? Since it's not my checkbook, I can't play in cheap channel for way I want to make a book, but don't let WRFX falsely just there was serious challenge in WRQM rights very. Until they acquire rights to a local team, hiring an answer with any real name recognition, and stop selling airtime to people off the street, they're not going to make much of a dent. People off the street, don't you love that? Oh yeah, wow, that course do Gats. In the most recent ratings, WRQM ranked 17th among all the new 6-Amen that were the 2.6-year, and WRFX was tied for 31st with a 0.5, that's end. 0.5, an coveted male 2554 demographic, WQM was stirred with a 4.8, while WRFX was 25th with a 0.8. In the meantime, Foster said yesterday, he's finalized contract with investors, whom he declined to identify as well as ESPN radio, to create a third-all support station in the market. But it won't be different until Foster's tragedy with local station, perhaps Waxi 790, which I thought that happened like weeks ago. Oh. The station would carry a mix of local and ESPN radio program including Dan Patrick's 1-4 PM show. Oh God, how can we handle that? All the while WQM general manager Greg Reed can sit back and laugh. As he mulls a run at Stern's morning show, is he running a run at Stern's no? No matter what happens at this station, the Scott for Well Disaster, the pictures on the internet scandal, WQM remains the market's 800-pound sports gorilla with big name hosts, three of the markets pro teams at the University of Miami. Try as it might, WQM can't mess up. Oh, right. In fact, I think Greg wrote this, I don't think very wrote any of this. It says WQM will use sporting news radio program into replace Eisenberg and Castella who are fired Wednesday after internet photos of them posing fully clothe, would make it a dull entertainer's in QM studio last September came to light. I think Reed wrote that crap, don't you? I don't think a very even rights stick in word. Very just sitting there eating his bolognese sandwich that mama brown bag for a month to be morning and Greg's sitting there tapping it out on the computer. Now Jim Sarny at the Sun's table, however, was not on a QM payroll, doesn't work for beastly broadcasting and luckily for him holds no beastly stock. In an article that's mostly about Jigs MacDonald, is going to do the same Patrick's they panther game on TV and the rumor will do the radio because they're going to have a panther against the Islanders, the team that Jim broadcast for 75 years. But third man. So they're going to like, you know, kind of have farewell because Jigs is returning after the season and so Jim Sarny kisses Jigs asked and he's always one of the greats, I'm not sure you're not going to fool. But anyway, later in the article he says, Fridge Owen Marx is Jim Sarny put you and Mark back on the air. Cash double nice and burger our young and hip rock casters, they're firing by WQM over old internet follows was just plain stupid. I don't like that. That's what Jim Sarny says, Greg, he says you're just plain stupid. And of course the difference in East or Articles being that Greg didn't write the one in the Sun's Sentinel as opposed to the one that appears by his mouthpiece in a hero. That's mouthpiece with an F. Now we got facts is that the old shoot on this sexual march situation, which is good. Because there's a possibility what I'm hearing is that there may be a revisiting of that situation and there really ought to be because like Jim Sarny says it was stupid. It childish and embarrassing. I mean, that's the way you operate and begin in major market radio. That's somebody farce and right away you go into a total panic. Seems to me that sounds like the beastly eff and way to me. Join WQM in the big. Today, in fact you can ask them, are you going over there to Fox and he'll just land. Join today five to seven of these spread PCS wireless store at 8743 Southwest 136 Read in the Prado shopping center that's owned by your Prado right off US one across in the falls big. Oh, the big.

Slowly raise up heat and realize they won't realize till it's go to late. This is the new doing of her America. Why ask Ray? And then he says, and I, I would have got to check this thing out.

My nomination to Beatles twist in shallow. I had to go to a twist in shallow by the, what's your call to eyes the brothers? Now I will say this. The eyes the brothers should, I mean, is there any question in which is the better version? Yeah, there's a question. There is in whose mind. You think the Beatles version is in the same league with the eyes Lee brothers, twist in shout. Mr. Two similar for me to care. You have to be dreaming. You have to be doing heavy heavy, heavy, do the medication. Well, that may be will must stop by this morning. Could drop off a good supply. Sorry. But anyway, no, that's a good one.

Then years later, months later, 50 years later, whenever somebody came along. And we did it. Good job. I'll tell you what they hear. What's that? How many songs can you name me? Well, I've heard of man. Sure. Feel it all right to Joe Cocker version. But you see, when you facts this in and you say the Joe Cocker version as opposed to like the Alta Cocker version, there is no other version. Who else did that? I just looked it up in a book. There's nothing in my jaw board book. And that's good enough for me. So I'm Schmidt Kannon. Now, Beatles got to get you into my life. Or the earth wouldn't fire the remake. Okay? Okay. You got that? Got it. Okay. Here's somebody's daughter, Pierre. First big yellow taxi, counting crows. Got it? Got it. And Mrs. Robinson, the lemon heads. Well, thank God it wasn't the lemon pipe.

Frank Wilson did the original, the most depressing songs ever. Don't we have that the Gary condo one? What else that called? Gary's last kiss. Huh? Something like that. One moment please. Yeah, there it is. Oh, we're all waking that shone to be. The lockers out on a home to scream. Yeah. But what I'm how shondry doing? A last kiss, Progen, is the group we want to put on there. Remake. Proud Mary, I continue to turn her turn to beat her around. I guess that's why I'm thinking about the original. Lou by you, Linda Ronstad, love Linda Ronstad. Man, she's great. Lou by you originally by Roy De Boy, which I got that summer hero. Guess what else I got? I don't have questions, y'all. By the eyes, the brothers in fact, I'm almost head to the go and run over to a record to somewhere in by and I'm still pissed off about the group. Test combo. The Beatles in F-S-Fong know I spit into a little song. Iasley brothers are absolutely outstanding and you better not thimus with them. I like the eyes of the brothers. Fine, well that's good. My way Elvis Presley, course originally by Frank Sinatra, who couldn't sing a note. I would rate that pistol version better. Greatest level of all. Whitney Houston, George Benson on the original he's dead. And let's stay together. Tina Turner, the original by Al Green, who's also, I should point out, very dead. Remember when Al Green died? No. Okay, how about when Bob Green died? Absolute number one we make. Oh, this is good. Dave the copies on a roll now. Jose Feliciano, light my fire. That was fabulous. Yes.

A year later. You ready for that? That was a top 30 hit. A top 30 man. Hit. So, um, I don't know. I guess I wouldn't put that under Woodstock by CSNY because I was the last one. You got that? Okay. What if you want to do it? I mean, this is all for fun. Anyway, we don't have some pain in the SP blood. Oh, when you got it wrong, you're well too bad. Suus. Here's our good friend, Jerry and Pony. Dispringces. I'd like to suggest love her. It's the best you make of a song. It originally be couldn't by the Evelie brothers. I sure liked the Evelie brothers a lot.

But it's a great hit. On Cadence Records. You know, who else was on Cadence Records? No. Andy Calb. Williams. Oh, Andy, my favorite. The remake I like was by Nazareth Loughher.

Just a joke. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. What do you think was the best remake of a hit song, huh? And I still say that some of these are pretty borderline. If Madonna will pardon that expression because some of the ones were not really hit. But because all along to watch there, they want that because it's Jimmy Hendrix and they're all smokey. I think that one right now and they're having a good time with it. So why should we be on air parade, okay? As for Elwood say. No, that's not the one. I don't have the water pipe.

He wouldn't get. He just went on the standard. But you on the other hand who've had all your friends die fat. And even though you don't believe me, I was well on my way with stretch marks, Bosting out of my clothes until I saw him cut the crap. I've got stretch marks that actually they could make a road map out of. Yeah. Dirty. I look like a purple zebra of the my stretch marks.

He got high, sit goodbyes and he died co-bane. Guys. Yeah thanks all 1118 at 5.60 WCM. You really got me by the King's and 3 done by Van Halen. There is no better remakes as Peter. Well I would have to agree with him at least he's a good boy. I understand that the pole is all about. Sure he doesn't. We're going to put it right on there but nevertheless. You really got me by Van Halen. Careful Van Halen but then again you don't need it. Here's the fact that it just like the boggles my mind. Okay. I got a lot of don't let me because before you know it it's going to be one o'clock and I'm going to all this stuff I want to talk about here today. About the joint mark all these fanks we got about Howard Spurman about the FCC and about the Janet Jackson almost live. It's going to be on ABC's good morning and mercilator this month but it will not be seen live. It'll be a 5 second video and audio delay. I hope he trusts her anymore. Yeah just because one little flap she's our hero. Tony Mitchell says this faxer wrote the song Woodstock for CSNY. She had the hotst for David Crossby at the time which indicates she needs serious help and then the other part of this fact though I don't get. Don't leave me this way which I remember the song very vividly but Harold Melvin and a blue note's 1975. I've thought my Houston 1977 the coming in our 86 written by Gilbert and how so what is what's the point. There choice right in other words that that's a list like you said how many we are we know. What do you think was the best remake of a hit song not how many songs have been remade the most times not how many can you list on a fax but get with it good guy. Man am I sorry I did this. All along the watch stars in the Hendrix 35 even though I guess it qualifies but not really not got on heavens door guns in roses 17. I will always love you Whitney Houston 13 I'm trying to find out what he used to know what the disc is that on what number which I almost don't my songs also on the same which is coming to number the district. I'll find it I got a hold your full that ACN cray. Yeah, see you love honey drippers 10 which I mean that song didn't need to be remade originally by Phil Phillips. Right. Blinded by the light manford man 10 you got a friend James Taylor. Me a 438. 438. 438. But what does that mean that's where the Whitney song is. 430 or this for yes. I thought you meant this for 138. I don't know many of you. Till there was you the Beatles 8. Locomotion Grand Funk 8. McCarthor parked on a summer 7. Locomotion by Kylie Minogue which I love 6. I can't even tell you which one I like the best. Did nobody fax their calls about the ACC and the sunshine band and whoever that brought was a joke. Locomotion. Damn it. 3. 3. 4. 7. Cross Jimmy Buffett 4. It's going to take a lot of love. I feel love Blue Man Group 3. Twist and chop the Beatles 3. It's my life no doubt 3. Yeah. Cocaine Eric Clapton 3. Mrs Robinson by the lemon heads. 2. Vigielo Taxi. Counting Croes 2. Prog Mary I continue to turn her one. Turn to beat around Gorg S. Steffan at bitch 1. Gotta get you into my life earth wind and fire 1. And signs by testies attesta. His one. Tell Suck. What is it? Tesla. It says it says right on here. I'm just quote what Josh wrote on here. Tesla. Tesla. Mark testies. It says on here. Mark tells him. What were we just talking about in this morning? Yeah. Now last kid's Pearl Jam light my fire was a Feliziano blue by you. Linda Ronsten greatest love of all without the tea. The first of the second tea is got the none. Let's stay together. Tina turned none. Faith, Olympus getting none. Love her. It's Nazareth none. And you mean he got me by Van Halen? None out of 160 now. We'll just get this thing going by the end of the show. We should have 1,000. About 30,000. About 30,000. There are different songs on here for you to prove over the weekend. Keep you out of trouble. Keep your ugly ass off the streets. Here's another one. I thought the law the Bobby Fuller 4. We made by the clash. That's a good song. Yes, it is. What's used to play the Panther games when Paul laws were getting the fight. And they've played a background. I thought the law and everybody. Like that. How are you doing Paul? Paul laws who I believe before he retired last year with the last of the original Panteros. I believe I'm not sure. Panthers don't see them no more. We made by the clash. You got it. The clash. You got it. Okay. Very good. Very good. I heard that the lead singer that group is just a little guy. Kind of a funny looking. Skin. Here's the fact that it says I never thought I would say this but I am. When I left this country for work in the United States in Europe it was great but came back last year and how times have changed. This administration is evil. Absolutely. And are you rooting our rights with their religious right wing agenda as well? There's slow merging of church and state. Getting bush out is the answer but I don't think hearing that Democrats are going to be much better. Just look at the vote in Congress. Only a select minority members voted against it. Very scary. So with that I started a process of selling properties and assets going to South America. I never thought I would do this but it's not the same country we should all be scared. 1984 is arrived grab your passport. It's Weesotype. It was all amen. So I can say. Amen. Good luck. Go to someplace safe like. Caracas. Or Bogota. Let's see. In 1977 Harry Bush in the tweezers. Oh no. Well that's what it says here. Yeah. This is the whole thing just below near one. I'm sure. Serious is city. Tony in the bunions. Okay. What are we saying? All right. That's cute. Ha ha ha ha. Hey, you never know. How do we know? We spoke to them very half as group ball group. We ought to. We want to be funny. Like we got to send us the facts. The facts are just pouring. Grimes is a couple more for the list. Run DMC's cover of Walk This Way by Arrow Smith which changed music when It created the rap rock genre fusion. Yes. Walk This Way. Yeah. Peter. How about baller confusion? There you go. Okay. So walk This Way. Run DMC. Got it. We got it. Van Hayland's cover of you really got me. Which we just put on. Even if you don't like him. Lenny Cravitz cover of American Woman. Yeah. Wait wait wait wait. American Woman by Stepan Wolf. We're fine. Brian. Brian. I know I'm going very fast here and it's easy for me to get confused in the middle of these 8,000 factions and 45,000 song titles in our teeth but American Woman by Stepan Wolf. To me that sounds sac religious to me. I'm so really correct. Shame on you. Oh, where is this? Where is this? Where is the ground? Where is the ground? Oh. This is the Bajar's version I've ever heard of. It's that the summer greatest fits that I've ever heard of. It's the summer greatest fits that I was in the studio. American Woman by Stepan Wolf. What the hell is this? Is that important coming? Yeah. In drag. The gang. The gang. We just got through a plain little bit of guess who yesterday you think Brian a few to have been listening which you certainly should have because I don't know to say pass for you for yesterday's show. The guess who. Not Stepan Wolf. Never less. Okay. So put whatever once you want from there on it. Got it. Five, six, seven, oh, let me just slip in one of these because we got a bunch of them. It says the whole Jill and Mark thing makes no freaking sense whatsoever. Somebody is looking at nude pictures on a work computer shouldn't they be the one discipline if anyone is regardless of the source of the photos. When the whole Howard Stern clear channel thing blew up a few days ago was mentioned that Stern is on a Beasley channel in Naples. Okay, is anybody ever seen Stern's E TV show I talked about that yesterday. He is naked at our entertainers in the studio all the time. And I sense it pictures of it nationwide. So apparently the Beasley bullcrapers aren't generally offended by the runner personalities appearing in published photos with naked chicks, at least at the get-who's ratings. Further, photores are not, Greg Reid knew who this was exactly the type of show that you are Mark were doing back then. And in my knowledge never cried at the school at the time and he did as you point up. It was at about the same time he heard Scott for Rau to bring the same type of antics to morning drive time and jeopardize the license. I mean, this whole thing stinks and wreaks of scapegoating very conveniently occurring while there is in a deep and deep and deep in the view of the world. And the video industry PS and here comes the most important in accurate line of this facts. You guys sure have some miserable bitches working in that building. On he doesn't say bitches he uses a word that begins with C. Why in local career sports video 5.62 a UAM. I remember when nobody in my name, but now I hear the big star. Turns a thing, I can make a hit on it, open it, taking your chance. All I do is scream like I'm in search. Don't mind so don't sound the thing. I can't believe that he falls down in. My head you told me not to change everything. So I guess I'll keep on a jelly. Don't mind so don't sound the same. I can't believe so high in these potatoes. Don't mind so don't sound the same. Yes. Speak in a witness you must be a witness man. But never less. Let him 33 and see some similarities. But you know.

tada women a former republican governor new jersey both courted and received stern's endorsement their races women was so grateful that the booster provided that she named a highway rest area in his honor so you can go back right on how do you like that so look after the stern people out there and on a much lesser level here in florida but of course is the pivotal state or very well could be

Why does that flow, why does that flow, why does that flow, why does that flow, why does that flow, why does that flow, do they get a swollen heart, while leaning out there gun, whoa, right up to the wall, the window, what Christians you performed, be fileless in the corner, the window, what Christians you performed, the window, what Christians you performed, see that standing, he then sits back down again and you, and watch it all down with the 12th of June, live a life of order of the heaven you've heard, got only smile upon pouring out the whole, oh, I left to know, why does that flow, hey, I left to know, why does that flow, oh, alright, that's my name, good thank goodness for that, 12 out to a five 60 WQAM, crispy cream says, hold the sugar, hold the azukaar, crispy cream don't us long on for its high calorie, treats plans to offer low sugar don't us to attract diners and diabetics. oh man, I sure hope it doesn't have any of that in it, yeah, crap, exactly how low the sugar content would be, is something only the company knows, and even in the hallowed halls of Donut Central, the answer may still be evolving. crispy cream spokeswoman Amy Hughes says, she doesn't know, because they do not, they do know not, it's still in the early stages of development, it's said today, but before the end of the year, what a crispy cream's hot original place, Donut's has 10 grams of sugar, and 200 calories, I'll take three please, more than half of those calories come from fact, called grams of it. crispy cream lover Clint Beaver, says while the low sugar don't us a good idea, he doubts he'll be giving up on the original, glazed variety, as for me, I'd all die eating the fatning don't us at Beaver, a student at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Ha ha ha ha ha! he's got to be a doctor, so he can go kill some people. One of his med school friends is Nathan Payton, found the whole idea of a low calorie don't us strange, it just seems odd they try to be healthy, and they're not paid right in that he'll give one a try. The idea of offering a low sugar don't us, isn't new for crispy cream, we've been looking at this for some time, said use. Crispy creams plans are relying with those in house recently by a number of fast food giants, including McDonald's, which is facing out super size portions of fair eyes and drinks, except for special promotions by the end of the year, no more poop resizing. Wednesday, the house past legislation that would ban lawsuits, against these joints, on the grounds they could bankrupt fast food chains and restaurants, even though of course they are killing us, and we don't care about that because they don't need a lot of mind to the right wing. Live and let die, did we get that honor guns and roses? I thought we did. I got you, babe, sunny and hair. We done by UB 40 and Chrissy Hind? Yes. Chrissy behind? Do we have that honor? From the presenters. Oh. Five six seven, open, member of the great pretended by the planners, of course now, I'm Decker Records. Five six seven, five sixty, pound five sixty on the ATT, how about the flying saucer's speaker that record by Buchanan Goodman? I remember the flying, huh? David, in Miami says, he can enjoy Marky's system. Fortunately, it sounds as if it is a sexual harassment issue. As ridiculous as it is, if a woman walks by your office and you have an offensive photo on the screen, could be something you're viewing a screen server wallpaper, screen-saver wallpaper, it's considered sexual harassment. It further goes on away bikini calendar on the wall. But this smells of sexual harassment, maybe that's why you can't get her name because she's protected over the years from power 96, that we don't have the name yet. But the person with the photos and his computer screen should have been recommended, not you and Mark, David, Miami, you are. I'm so, we're going to be correct. I'm going to be right on it, man. They didn't have a computer on somewhere. It was not their website. I mean, the whole thing is so absolutely stupid, even the, I'm not just Jim Sarny, said that something got a stink somewhere, okay? People over there in Naples, man. The beastly people, the same people that are running Howard Stern over there by we should point out on their FM. In Naples, who's coming under tremendous assault, who's under 75 delays, and they fired you on Mark because somebody found a photo with a strip around it on a website from 80 minutes from seven months ago. You know what I really think? What do you really think? I think it's another one of those cost cutting measures to me. We just, you know, they're talking about, well, maybe Dave Higgin wants to be on in there, and this one, no one. I don't think anybody's going to be on in there. I think it's going to be sporting news radio. They open up a pot of cost and nothing. What did I say two days ago? Yeah. This to me just looks like window dressing on another cost cutting measure by the beastly. I'm excuse. Yeah. Just waiting to find an excuse to get them off the air. Well, I'm not making us any money, you know. I mean, I don't know that for a fact. That's just my guess because I don't think anybody could be this stupid. It's one thing to overreact. It's another thing to go off the air, like Renfield and, you know, Dracula. Yeah. Charles and Dearfield Beach says, just a thought, but I think it's safe to say this whole FCC which got its impetus by the exposure of Janet Jackson's memory gland on TV. So I ask you, is it my imagination? And most of the heads rolling as a result of that unfortunate word-droom malfunction seem to be on radio. That's right, Charles. We had an article on our website the other day about how radio always takes it up the old shoot and TV and they get off easy. Not that I'm trying to start yet another conspiracy theory say, Charles, Paul suggested for yesterday, and this is a good one. 100 or 100 instead of 100. 100. 100 bucks. Oh, here's a good one. Pinball was it, Elton John. Never done that. I mean, he did a lot of good stuff. Yeah. Yeah. The who and Elton John remade it. Pinball was it. You got that on there, Josh? Yeah, I got. Excellent. Paul says, I heard Debbie on CNN referred to his conversation with a minister of Spain, Jose Maria as NAR by saying, I just got off the phone with his majesty King Jose Maria as NAR of Spain. Oh, hey, let's say at least he's making improvements when he first met him three and a half years ago, he called him up on Prince Ansar. Prince Ansar. The prime minister of Spain, Jose Maria as NAR. He probably thought he's kind of it as NAR. 560, 50560, 5080, 80 and T in Verizon, wireless long. Let's get another two 3000 songs on a list here. So we'll keep you real busy over the weekend.

I heard something that you said something that right wingers have said about you you said the n-n should not be allowed to be pulled off the air. Yeah. I know you're pointing to you and I know you're you're trying to thought that's a dangerous type of comment. Oh, I'm sorry. Look at said CNN should be yanked. I understand it. But you but you know what I'm saying to right. Yeah, I know what you're saying. Okay. But I still say it's CNN needs to be off the air. I wouldn't know you would with it either. But you know what anybody else can be on here except CNN how's that? Okay. Have a great day. Good job. Okay. I'll hitler. Yeah. How Hitler? Let's get used to a baby. How Hitler? Oh, there is a great one. Was it yesterday on our, uh, uh, see a lot of the bedtime stories we have. They're just too long for me to even think about reading even part of the monure because if you only read part, it doesn't give the whole, uh, you know, deal. But about the guy who wasn't apologizing for comparing the, um, bush regime to the innancies and he talked about the, uh, proponents of homosexuals and Nazi Germany and the evenest speculation that Hitler was bisexual and about how they then turned to persegued all the homosexuals along with everybody else except the course goes who sucked up to them. That doesn't sound too familiar. Does it misfudge? No, no, no, no. Or any of those people like you log cabin rollers who probably roll in some right now. Fudge that is. 12 13 at 560 Q. CMN has to be off the year. Bob. Okay. My job is to infiltrate on this floor and liberal decent group, who disagree with our glorious administration.

Yeah, we need somebody serious to run from prison like Arnold. Here you go. 12 17 at 560 WQAM. All want to watch tower the best remake of a hit song ever. Jimmy Handrichs 64 Rest in Peace. Not gonna have his doors make it a move Guns in roses 51. I will always love you Whitney Houston 20. So it's a two-hospital race right now. I mean, Whitney Houston is that high up on a list that tells you these are not the best group. How about? I thought we were going to remake that. No, I'm not just playing the song. It just happens to be a revolution. Just a party time five. Have you ever seen this series of these series? Yeah, which I had that one. That's a good one. In fact, yesterday I played some of these two, including any case usual theme song that I'm really getting tired of hearing. Wow, I've been in this. Oh, no. Yeah, hate that. Bussie. Come on now. I'm filming this. Or how about? We're getting a set of high ones. We got the boot. We crossed the one. There's one I think the NRA likes a lot. Anyway, good disk. There's absolutely nothing to do with anything. Let's see. The ultimate remake is and always will be vanilla fudges you keep me hanging on, which of course was originally done by the wonderful lovely related Dhanaross new Supremes. You keep me hanging on. They're all a fudge, which is a last about seven I have been in something like that. Right. Right. That's why we like it in this business. I can't believe nobody called in this one yesterday orientated as opposed to oriented. I got this new job and I have to get orientated. Excellent one. Also, sing for the moment, not sing for a moment. Sing for the moment. I still know that song to you. Sing for the moment. That's an aerosmith song. Well, let me look up the title. Okay, it'll kill some good timing. Or this book weighs about many, many pound. We never got the name of that. So we demand one hit wonder is baby. Anyway, it's sing for the moment and guess what? It's still it's still on in here. I don't kind of sing I got sing a song with wind and fire. Sing boy sing Tommy Sands on Capitol Work as Mammoth Tommy Sands. Teenage Crush Tommy Sands. Do you remember that? Shame on you. How about tab hunter remember him? I bet you what what's the name did Tony Perkins. Well, I'll tell you one. I get a little bit excited thinking about Tony Perkins and tab hunter. That's the rumor. Of course, Tony Perkins is dead. And when tab hunter finally croaks, well, last night I guess we'll ever hit on last night. I give up. Since I'm over the age of 100, I'm in Laga Watch of Once in a While. He had on rock Hudson's wife. She was married home for three years. Yeah, yeah, they did it. Prop wife. They did it. He probably closed his eyes and thought it Goma. Is that what what? Thought a goober? You know what the first thing what she said in the Larry? We did it. That's what she said. Anyway, moving right along, let's see, former brothers Johnson lover to lie heard you say it. What does that mean? He said the botanical to win. I get by with a little help from my friends. A little help from my friends. Originally to Beatles on Sergeant Pepper, we made by Joe Cocker and his sister, Arthur Cocker, the one-day-years theme song says you see a Kenny. A little help from my friends. Now he writes I get by with the help from my friends, but I'm sure that's not the song right right you right a little help from my friends. Joe Cocker you got it there, Josh got it good. Josh is right on top of it. Rick says sitting on the dock of the Bay should be on a pole remade by Michael Bolton. Oh, no, now even a parody on sitting on a bench. You know, we'll be over. And I think that's one of the 10 that we can still play, of course. We sit on a couch. We can't. I'll see. Here's another example of not understanding the pole Rick. I mean, Rick usually fances good stuff, but in this particular case, what do you think was the best remake of a hit song? And any says it was made by Michael Bolton among others. Well, what does that mean? My wife, Joe Cocker, do the balls. See what I'm saying? But if you want, we'll put Michael Bolton on his sit on a dock that we will humor him even though, of course, you are puke and be for it, forget about it. Oh, you know something, you know the reason that we didn't get the KC thing I got the wrong song. Am I stupid or what? Am I dumb? More on deck and cool. The KC song was right now. All right, now dancing in the streets, but who we're going to put down? We don't have that on it. Who do we mean that besides the case? Martin of Andellos. You want to know a forget about KC. Let's see, dancing in the street. Nick and David Bowie did it. Nick, Jagger and David Bowie. Well, Van Halen made it too. But I don't want to put Van Halen. We already got a couple of Van Halen. What about Nick and David Bowie? 85, huh? What? I hated their version. Are you picking on Nick? Oh, I don't like it either. I want the boat as only. Hey, David, David, David Bowie. You know what would be great? Here's an idea for Boca Brian to stick to the Howard Dean places in there, huh? They're dancing Arizona. That would be great. We take a little bit of work, but I think he can handle it. If anybody could have that little ball to hit a geek Boca Brian, he could do it. You know what I'm saying? I'm sure he's working on it now. Yeah, it's perfect. Tracy and Kendall says my vote is for Tommy James and Ashane Nelson. Moni Moni, we made by the bizarre Billy Idol. That's a good one. Okay. It says, would you play a drop of the appuram lady since the holiday past-by-do run vacation? Oh, and you already told me, he had your home entache, which is nice. Indeed. It was a wonderful food basket from the Halberstein of this year. Trail mix, cookies, the Scotty. Happy prom fruit. I don't take any bulls. Hey, happy prom. I'm not with the broken bank for calling to your mother. Oh, happy prom. Well, we sure miss her. She was the best. Have a great day to Tracy and Kendall. Thanks for the memories. Okay. Thanks for the f***. Rease. Jeff says, good to hear it we made by Cheryl Crowe, of the first cut as the deepest written by Kent Stevens and recorded by Rod Stewart as a pretty good-sized hit. It was fairly big. I like this. The first cut is the deepest. Cattier will crow. Also, Ronald Eisley is alive and well. Spetsam years his Mr. Big just completed them with burg back a rack. John Lennon always said the Beatles' twist and shout was an homage to the Eisley Brothers. See, there you go. Mr. Smarty Pants. Mr. Smarty Pants, the Eisley Brothers, you got the same thing with Marvin Gage. You got with the Eisley Brothers. You do not give them a like for Eisley Brothers. No, you don't like Marvin Gage though. I do like Marvin Gage. Just to beat boys a better. No. Okay. No, you don't like him because his name is Gage. That's the problem. Okay. Pulling anybody. It's a spik thing. What is this past known at 5.60? You're Gage Station QAM? We're sports radio 5.0. I understand. I would say this is probably the greatest song ever we've recorded. And I'm not gonna argue. I'm not gonna. Really? Really? I love it. That's what we need boys and girls a little more than fill it off your freedom in America, but it's dead dead dead dead. Thanks to these right wing lunatics, these fascist, these hit Larry and lunatics that have taken over that stony election in broad daylight. Here's the deal. This is why I say CNN needs to be off the year by one o'clock at the latest. Maybe by 1233 would be better. By the way, Eric for some reason, our clock has slowed down two minutes, but it's not the right time. But anyway, if you notice that, no, I didn't. Let me go a look. Yeah, on our webbook, on our homepage. PURT so it has. Yeah, something strange about it. Probably a Kami Pinko law conspiracy. High Hitler. But CNN reports this thing yesterday and today, the house passes the indecency bill 391 to 22 with no comment, with no debate, with no like, okay. Well, Blitz Creek, my ass. Of course, for the, I love this. I love to see them come up from behind him right now with a muzzle and just put a big curchiff right around his mouth and drag him off kicking and screaming like Howard Veal. What you all to see that? Yeah, I'll post drag his ass off the stage. Oh, now what is this thing? Top TV radio station contributors. Eric, uh, he may owe me something. I guess I'll have to look at during the next break. He says in particular, look at the beeslies. Uh, oh, look at those beeslies. Oh, who we can't afford to pay Joe and Mark, but we can afford to be, uh, you know, well, well, well, whatever they're doing. Let's see, here's what it says. I'm currently looking for any photo of Howard David with strippers at all, films. There's even a hooter girl with an impulse sticking out. It's been if your listeners might have these photos. I'll be using them for a website. I'm starting. Once it's up and running out and form George and he can look at the side of it at work, hopefully someone in the yourselves, the prompt will see this and mold the fire sincerely. Defoe. Oh, that's cute. I like that. By the way, we got a guy here in Toronto. Defoe, looks like you're twin brother. Paul Romanock, he's not an awful Sunday morning. A show on Leef's TV, ah, the reporters, Paul Romanock. He's like Defoe, light. That's an incredible Harry Chaper, 1974. Ugly kid, uh, one? Joe. I go with Kid Joe. Yeah. I know it's Joe, but look at the way that's written. Look at Joe. I'll be Kid Joe, 1993. So that's good. We Kid Joe as in Joe Mama says David from Pennfield, no less. I wonder if that's Pennfield, New York. Must be. Must be. Must be. Must be. Must be my friend David from Pennfield, New York. Well, excellent choice, David. Moved him right along, 560, 70560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon World Slider. That plug you thinking, yeah, and I think I did. And a cardee dodge. I'll next hour. Okay. I'll just go on to work. I'll take it right now. Anybody got, oh, look what just happened. That is the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen in my life. What, what, what? Wow. My computer, the monitor for the phone for the tell us. Yeah. It was, it was in the, you know, screen saver thing. So I slid my mouse. Can I say that slid my, I slid my, I slid my. You touched it now. Now it's like bizarre. What? Like, like, yeah. What is that all about? I think it's going to blow up. Is it? Let's take a call. QAM Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. All right. And look how good the phone calls sounds. I think something great just happened. How cool. For all your musical look up needs, all music guy that's on the internet.

I love you. All right. See you. I like that. Now this thing is still staying in this mode. I don't want to lose it. Have you ever seen it like this? I've seen weird things before. And not like this. This is beautiful. It's like, I mean, the white part is white except on the bottom of the clock is and then on the right, we're all the the phone lines are into flashing and the wow. It's like psychedelics. It's just like I just did a few of the mushrooms I brought back from Amsterdam. I mean, 30 QM hello. Maybe I'll wear it pretty good. I got one for the pole and I got a question. Okay. Easy by Lionel Ricky. Right. It was covered by space no more. Faith no more. Yeah. They was the D side on a single. Okay. And a question was, um, I'm pretty good. So even though I don't like Donald Richie that much, it's okay. It's a good song. Yeah, it is. It's Josh's mother available tonight and if so, will she give it up in the first day? 730. Needs to the QM door. But the answer to the second question is no. And so picture. Now, Oscar says, remember, Oscar from summer 42, that's where you never saw that movie. No. It was Benji and Oscar. Good afternoon, Neil and George. It says, please see if you can find roar of Beethoven by ELO. I think I got it. Do you? Yeah. I know I have the best of ELO. So if it's on here, I got it. I love ELO. ELO is great. The beginning is very deceiving. The rest is pure. You can enjoy it. You might want to play the whole thing. How about he or she commented, it Oya commented. And a rush favorite Tata Tate where he doesn't know that it's pronounced the T in the second tape as well. He says, Tata T. He should know better well. Maybe he takes some of the wrong good drugs. It says, it's great. Keep it up in the show, too. So Oscar, while I get my ELO, this got momentarily during the break. Okay. We had enough Elton John. Well, I love Elton John, but I don't want you to. Oh, Elton John. Right. That's like example. Like this. Like I think that I'm still paying the song. You know what I got so standing? I hate it. Like I love it. That. You just like the video. You just like the video. You just like the video. You just like the video. You just like the video. You probably like that one. You did an unsuffb. What was that? Something in Spanish? Wouldn't it be a spanish? No, I don't know. You're going to collaborate next. But he was just down there to hang out with those hot young. Remember, that's right. It was before your time. Nick Lawrence was my producer. You don't remember this, do you? Rock and roll. No. He located those two male models who were in that video. You talk about it all the time. And he actually located in Rottenham in on the year show. And I hate to say it, but they were both, uh, let me say this. Make up. Can make you look a lot better. Okay. That's a very delicate way of putting it. It won't be a little ready on that grade. But anyway, one of them kind of like, I think we had to put a lead weights on them to keep mine a floor. But that's how it beats for you. What can you do? 560, 0560, pound 560. Yeah. And that was a good video. What would you want to collaborate in this, Sponio? See? Okay. Maybe okay. Video. Oh, I just love sitting here. I'm just not taking any calls. We're going to sit here and look at this monitor. Man, I have never seen nothing like it. W to Q and hello. Oh, no. Yes, sir. Hey, Daniel. This is a habit for a yesterday's thing. It's a word that you, you're going to say, you say Schwartz or the Schwartz or Spots or whatever. I never say Schwartz. I never say Schwartz or you say Schwartz. Yeah. That's a never say Schwartz. No, the only Schwartz I know is like Arnold Schwartz. He is a Delia and South Beach. Get with it. Schwach. Ashwach. 21 till 1. I'm going to look for my ELR. I'm going to sit here. I'm going to stare at this thing. It is mesmerized. I want to be a Latino and say, hey, my, no, it weren't that on my head. Now I want to wear a sleak 50 in my hair and dark sunglasses to cover my face. I want to drive in a big car with that buskin interior with loud assays. I want to girl name Juanita. I want to girl name Juanita with all black hair. Fake blue eyes and big gold chains. I want to know. I want to know. I want to know. I want to know. They make the world loop and then I don't do his eyes. Be happy. I'm in a safe way down. He had a wife. My sister that was way too tight. See, 45. 55. 52. W to Q. I am. So Frank says you have a mention to our center of the park's land remakes. I didn't know that he sent him. This is the first time I saw this fact. Plus, Montley crew. We make a smoke in the boys room. Grand funk railroad. Two is got a pair. Right? Yeah. And make it at the remake of no more Mr. Nice guy Alice Cooper. What we didn't have that one yet. So we didn't have it on there. Right? Now we do. There. Yeah. Here's one. I shot this year of Eric Clapton Bob Marley from Clip and Coral Springs. Thanks, Cliff. Yeah, man. Now here's an interesting thing. Here's a response that the assholes, I mean the fine gentleman, a clear channel sent to one of our listeners, Michael and Boca, who was contacting and communicating with him and there is great displeasure with their removal of the Howard Stern show from big. And let me say it again before we just cracked that they sent him back. We have listed on our website right there on the, here are the top of the page. All of the eight South Florida clear channel radio stations for you in big, loud and Palm Beach. So covering yourselves accordingly, that's my suggestion to you. If you want to get even with Chief Channel, not only don't listen any of the radio stations, but certainly do not blow them any tangible support if you catch my drift. Don't tell anybody that you listen to big, or any of those other seven evil conversations. That's it's the best way. Just like Joey Zazaman said of a message immediately if not sooner.

Clear channel radio is decision to suspend Howard Stern from our stations is based on our regular three obligations that commitment to airing material that conforms to the standard and sensibilities of the local communities we serve. Right. That's why he only has a ten share in men. The decision to suspend the Howard Stern show was difficult. However, as broadcast licenses, we have illegal obligation to protect our listeners from indecent material when children are more likely to be in the audience. As a result, we will not air Howard Stern on their channel stations until we're sure that the show will conform to acceptable standards are responsible broadcasting, in other words, till health freezes over.

We got I shot the sheriff I was gonna play that I shot the sheriff thing and I listened to it during a break can't play it and had too many To shocking well, I mean no, seriously what what are we talking about here boys and girls Jesus 391 to 22 the have said it he built past in the house. It'll little of a different version somewhat different version We'll pass this in El Presidente the chancellor the rice Marshall will sign it and then it'll be a little bit And then everybody's gonna have to be like ping in her pants because well, here's a half a million dollar fine for you and here's a billion dollar fine for you And it just based on what based on the fact that they just said around and made it up they keep embellishing it and embellishing it First it was the seven George Carlin words that was back in the 70s how many years ago was that? Me two years ago But a George Carlin 70 rewards and instead of progressing and instead of a country where they were we were growing up a little bit No, we keep taking gigantic steps backward Sexual activity or excretory act, and what what does that mean nobody even knows what it means? And now they say forget about local community standards which it always was it's based on the average listener in the US The average there's such a thing as the average person no forget about average listener the average person no There's no such thing In people And by the way keep in mind they will decide your government in action. They'll decide how I'm gonna read that again I don't want to like paraphrase. I want to read it right from the horses ass In order to be found in decent the native the language involved whether explicit double on ton any window or sound effects Must constitute a patty offensive description or depiction of a sex act or gonna ask literary function and Determining whether languages patly offensive however, it's important to recognize that local community standards are not used Since when are we from circus I guess Rather the FCC considers whether an average adult listener in the US an average adult listener would find the broadcast matter patly offensive And the FCC will rely on its own expertise in determining the standards of the average adult listener For this reason the FCC is held at the actual popularity among adults residing in the market where programmers will not Insulate material from the finding of indecency you could have a 99 share But if we decide that it's indecency while you're screwed So I figure it's somebody that got like a sea average in school Makes the real average income How does the real average looking you know face yeah shoulder and drives an average looking car right? Let's find that guy average white guy average white band Here's a fact that says used to listen to Joe and Mark overnight But it was better when they were on Saturday afternoons They were doing it for a while. I don't understand even when they talked sports They made it fun entertaining these guys are not boring like the rest of the shame their gone Silly and cool springs pieces there anything we can do to get the back color right to station absolutely They ought to be flooded with phone calls and with emails Well, what should we what do we want to give out? May up wait huh the main office number and Who they're gonna call for Carlos You're gonna have our audience calling for Carlos Yeah, you're gonna do that to our killer. You don't carry the message along. Yeah, but he will Think about it. Okay What's that number? 3 of 5 653 653 6 6 67 Don't give me what a question Mark I'm not a lot of the rushes of Various That is correct Oh absolutely host that note in that room 305 653 6 7 9 6 9. I know we have a brow number do we have it? Yeah, but I don't have that man. We'll get it Okay, if we don't get it you'll get it There you go. We'll give the numbers out if you want to complain calling the director You're complaint don't just sit and take it lay and down and I'm gonna say to get it Father's me deeply. I don't want to elect be the odd man. I'll put out everybody care. I was him anyway It's only non sports show on a station But it just disturbs me that my colleagues don't seem to be going to bat you know Suppose it would have been hanks suppose you know where we had that incident with hank being suspended for a week I went ballistic over that because I think that was totally inappropriate and excessive and ridiculous And now we got you on marketing can and flat an Anthony as well They're good guys they never stole a freight train I mean no they're not on the middle of the day It's not a pivotal program for the radio station I'm making us any money but the fact that a matter is to just sit back and watch your colleagues get screwed over I mean with gorilla was it a different story Everybody knew for L was gonna get fired or wasn't a question of if it was a question of when He had more lives than and everybody can't they could warned him and bored him He had how many meetings a day Signed papers. I'm not gonna do this. I'm not gonna say that and just kept doing it. He shot himself enough But so I can't feel too much sympathy for him. He's got on he's got an endless history of getting canned everywhere He goes because he's got a career death wish So it's unfortunate But he's just he's out of control. He's a uncontrollable whirling village on the other hand these guys These guys are like Sunday school preachers by comparison and Somebody allegedly finds a photo on somebody else's website from seven months ago Walks by it and is bitterly offended and then lodges a complaint or starts a big sentence and that's the excuse for Canning their ass. I don't think so. What a joke. What an embarrassment So I think that somebody other people on this station ought to be raising holy hell too now the humper Of course, he's Not a position right now to be raising too much hell. You know, they took him to the rich at last wake right But somebody other people on there I think it's about time that you looked around and started siphoned the appadels okay because it was then this week Maybe it might be your ass next week okay For something you least suspect it might be I guarantee a one thing this show will not be the scapegoat of this radio station or any other radio station for the FCC You can bet your edges life on it, okay and Greg and the and clearance better lives on it For this thing is still got that and just phenomenal color. I think this something I'm a miracle happen.

The major old pet countries are afraid they'll lose control of their countries if they do a rack of men succeeds with a democratic government and the people get too much freedom. So what better way to disrupt our election? This raised crude oil prices hope the next administration will pull out all of our troops and let the next terrorist run ramp and all my god. This is a Bush looking facts like I said, a really lame facts idiotic pathetic. Loona to ride. Maybe that's why Bush runs around with Prince Van D'Armen Armhand in hand.

You're begging them not to vote for this thing and they're explaining them how that it's it's just a It's just an open habit of to start finding people and take away free speech just to make it up as you go along And obviously they really listen very carefully to what the after people had to say right and it's up to you It's an election year, baby, which of course is the reason that Michael Powell and his band of fascists brought this up this year They use the genit action just and think about flat at the Super Bowl just as an excuse Which is why I'm starting to wonder not that I'm a conspiracy theorist but the geonmark thing It seems to me especially of budget cuts that we've heard lately at QAM See it's one thing and maybe I'm totally off the base like I can't make the accusation But I'm suspicious of it because something that my nude something that ludicrous ridiculous to use that is an excuse to fire for people I'm not buying it You have to be so panicky or like a junelson hanging out at your house every day with her depends You probably have to borrow borrow most back 15 20 30 times a day catch my drift I mean if you want to say well guess what we have budget cutbacks We can't afford a live show in a morning.

Sure, that's the Kerry McCain What's not to like? Kerry's a thanks from Joe, what?

You forgot to remind me. Hey, don't forget that Ted Rawl column Ted Rawl, first they came for the shockjocks the censoring of Howard Stern he writes During the 50s actors and screenwriters sympathetic to progressive and radical causes found a nearly impossible A gear work though they couldn't prove it black ball Hollywood talent new weather telephones It's top-reaching somewhere behind the scenes. Someone powerful. Someone who believe that America was composed only of two kinds of people Communist and right-thinking souls like themselves was working the silence them.

I'm guessing that sometime next week will be my last show on this station There's a cultural war going on the religious right is winning we're losing If clear channel truly had a two zero tolerance policy on decency Stern points out of wouldn't have hired file mouthwriving Republican Michael Savage as its KPRCA M host in Houston Savage they infamously shouted that homosexual should get AIDS and die and MSNBC The real reason he's being attacked Stern says is that he dared to criticize George W. Bush If you don't think me going after Bush got me thrown off those stations you got nothing coming says Howard My days here are numbered because I dare to speak out against the Bush administration and say that the religious agenda of George W. Bush Concerning stem cell research and gate and what he's doing with the FCC is pushing his religious agenda And also the fact that the guy takes more vacation time than any president and ever I don't think we can stop a short of me calling up the president saying look man I'm going to support you so don't do this The new McCarthyism doesn't always flow from the top down the New York Times which has published my editorial cartoons for 13 years through three presidents Suddenly exes ex eyes from its website on March 1 leaving a Soviet style hole on its comics page In an or while he intuased it even deleted the archives After two years of monitoring cartoons by Ted Rawl we decided that while he often does good work We found some of his humor without him keeping with the tone we try to set for New York Times dot com Stammer Day time digital spokesperson to editor in publisher magazine when any censorship complaints began coming in We recognize an obligation to which your are uses what we published that what we published doesn't offend the reasonable sensibilities of our audience To is credit to papers on but's been wrote that he disagreed with the decision Those reasonable sensibilities at times inside or tells me have less to do with the tone than political content As the most liberal cartoonist in the group of 10 I worked through a disproportion number of emails from anoid Republicans Adding to an already short-staff department's workload.
