That's why I'm here chilling. Hey, listen, chillin. I've decided that I'm just gonna get long with everybody. That's why I'm just gonna get long while I'm here. These two or three whatever it's gonna be a couple of weeks. Just get long with everybody. Why not? All my good clothes, personal friends and even those who aren't, you know, chillin up. Why not? CHU-M-Chum, Toronto. Yeah, that was the big A.M. Rockstation back long, or 1050 on the dial. That's the WMGM in the York 1050 on the dial. So if you'd like to live in Rochester was great cause the pen out which way to win was blowing some days you'd hear CHU-M some days you'd hear WMGM in the York and some days you'd hear them both at the same time. Which was great. It would be like me talking and playing like this. Which after a Friday when a book comes out of one o'clock that's a Friday is D-Day that these days for disaster or could stand for Danny or it could stand for Dave and Danny. Dave or it could stand for adult rhymes with that either Pope. I can't believe it. It goes to show you if you give an old koot long enough time after about 100 years and he Pope finally writes an article that says something I can't I'm shocked. Thank the Lord that I'm here because I I'll admit that if I was to do the show from Toronto even though I would read both websites I would never read the Eddie Pope column on a bet. Oh wait a minute. But now that I actually have it in my hand of the hero too here it is day after Dan. Wolf says no to job. Well Ron Wolf said he's going to not come in but Eddie the Pope says marino hiring is just a smoke screen and you know what I'm thinking? I'm so rick a ruckus. I was going into the Pope who is probably next to Joe Rose the biggest marino lover in the history of mankind. In fact in the article is a really is really kind of a cute line. Do I dare read it George? Please he says uh really? He says look I've always been a marino man. I'm saying no Schmidt. Wow what a shock. He says never blamed him for never winning a super goal. I mean his head was so far updandy's ass that Joe Rose had a win in line. But Eddie the Pope finally pulled his head out and gets to get a little air or something after all these years and looked around and said guess what this is a smoke screen you're not fooling us and whoever the hero put in a picture of Danny he ought to sue the hero for millions. Look can you see it in there? Can you see it from here? Okay barely. The Danny is not open there. He looks like a mannequin. All you need to see other the strings. He looks like a puppet his arm is like stilted up and he has got mouth wide open like that. I mean realize you know any picture can make you look like whatever you want. He looks like a puppet. He looks just like a puppet. I'll put it for you. Something next to my point was yes. I mean that is uh everybody's got to take a look at that picture man it's on the front of the sports section of the hero. By the way Nathan Horton's hurt in that poor kid what a great player he's going to be. But the panthers suck wind again last night. 8 million shots against poor Bobby La Lunger again in Edmonton. They lose four two. Actually was four one. It was almost over. They got blown out 16 to one. They got shot in the first period. And before for one go stand on the set it would have been 85 to two very ugly. At least one last night against Calgary. But it was five major injuries that's going boys. No hockey talk we don't want no I know somebody called the mad dog I'm driving home when we know today and somebody calls him and says what about that wind and against the flyers and Nathan Horton and you never heard anybody move on so fast. You would have thought it was Chambha I mean even Chambha would have been a little longer I think than poor hockey guy. Try to talk to the mad dog. Well we don't want no hockey talk on his sports on his football stay on his dolphin station okay you better get with it on your Danny Dave and dolphin station it's in 3D. What did you tell me we're broadcasting in now? HD. Forget about that no we're in 3D now. Danny Dave and dolphins all day all along all day. Right boy better get another person to hear it help us out. I'll say Danny you say Davy and then we need somebody called Danny. Davy. dolphins. Oh see I can do it I can pull away the two I'm getting paid for two so I can pull away. Danny Davy. dolphins. Danny Davy. Day after Dan Marino hiring just a smokescreen I'll get to that. Any pop com I was going Eddie old coot man you've seen how old fart. Before we talk about he's the Rascal House of Sports he is to sports with Dave Barry is to humor. See I don't want to go into it I don't want to get because I'm in too good of a mood. Had our heard Howard this morning Mo talking about the whole deal and so Gellies have another kid. Oh I don't know if you were in his position would you be having a second child? Oh I guess I'm asking the wrong person. It always up to one. Oh man hey Gellie if you keep that thing out of there a little while maybe you know that's that's for the catalyze to do that. I always have a bun in the oven like the latinos sometimes something. Venus, cow rats, black and the humans don't do that. Don't do what have huge families. I mean the old country right. Now I'm talking about here it has to do with skin color are there a little bit more practical. Now what does that mean it's a racial fan? Yeah. Cubans don't go to UM. I don't believe that or plenty of Cubans on a baseball team even back when I was doing a games. We had Alex the Jesus and Frankie Castro the family's in the old country. What's about anything? Huh? The family's in the old country would have a lot of kids and we had the how we should pure. He was Cuban. Anyway how's that pull from yesterday? What we had a phenomenal response yesterday? Tremendous first we took let me just again in case you were like hiding under a rock somewhere what don't I do with that to dust steal it? Only kidding, dust relax. All right he is such a nervous nilly man and I can't blame him. He's another victim of this joint of this place. This business. I don't want to like pick on our friend there, Dick whatever his name is. But does those Connecticut School of Broadcasting spots? I like to put him on him. Well he's seen us in case of good guy. But I don't want to like discourage anybody from going to his joint given a lot of money. But don't get in this business. I've been telling people that for a long long time, many, many years. Go to it. This is the worst fug in business. It's just awful. And people would say well how can you say that you're sitting there on your ass over and up a big mouth and making all that money? Well, there are always our sections. And the fact that the matter is that you know two strokes later and just having me for two of this ability to stick through all of it. But most people just don't have the four to two to put up with the bull crab. And that's basically what this business is. This crab. Oh I'm not before I get to this. I don't want to get anybody nervous. But see this, this, this is just a work out in here. I'll see. No, it just doesn't delay out of this room as awful. You want to see the layout ahead and Amsterdam? Boy, that was, it was, if your arms, if you had like alligator arms like a certain people we know, you know, what's alligator arms in reverse? Daddy long legs like plastic man like arms plastic man. If you had long arms, then it was fine. But that thing was a joke. I was going Bob for both you idiot, but you got to free me away anyway. I think he bought it. I think Bob were moving on the company to him because he's corporate, you know, and by the way, Bob for both in the George Corse, so we're getting pretty pissed off and tired of waiting for you to get that other computer fixed in any other room. So that we actually have a functional studio here. I know you don't care about it and you hate us like poison, but that's beside a point. And stuff said if you don't get with it, pretty soon he's going to start crying. And nobody said this morning. He's going to start tearing up again if you guys don't get on top of it. Get with it. We'd like fix it coming in here in top of shit, but he knows nothing about that stuff. He's good with, you know, like the advocacy's real good and operating that. Huh? He's a little kind of an old fashion guy. Can't you tell by looking at him? He's a 60's burnout. He is. I like fix it. Okay. He's a good guy. He just don't know nothing about putters. Anyway, terrorist spam or a genuine threat. I don't want to get anybody nervous, but BBC news says they reported today that intelligence agency are investigating a series of internet warnings said to be issued by Al Qaeda about major terrorist attacks on the United States. The messages posted on several Islamist websites include claims that entire city could be destroyed. This week, a statement said to be from Al Qaeda intelligence services. Warms account out to hit America had begun. It'll be even stronger. A bigger strike than nuclear weapons. So be prepared. Oh, Muda Hadine Holy soldiers, it's the statement concluded that in the lesson American, it's allies with Dr. From Iraq, Afghanistan and all Islamic countries, the organization had ordered the elimination of US leaders and their supporters. Another statement repeated three times in recent days. Was posted on Islamist internet forum called the Muda Hadine Network. Well, I've been watching it. It claimed to be, I think it's so Fox News. It claimed to be from the Islamic nation of the American people and voted that its group now had the ability to destroy an entire US city. There were a lot of such messages on the internet. Some not necessarily knew when their office are hired to identify. It makes it almost impossible to determine whether these are really our final warnings before an attack. Like those of 9-11. Just wishful thinking by al Qaeda sympathizers. But US and UK intelligence services are taking the messages and their content seriously. It says, now it's pretty obvious that they're taking serious, which is why they reduced the threat levels from orange to yellow. Right. And it like, isn't there like a logical progression there? That's from the boy. So take it with several grains of salt. Call us in a morning. Okay. We'll do the Danny Boyo. I'll give it that result again in the other poll. I love the stuff to do here on a window. No more of that comedy but sour. We should make it that last week. So we sure hope you appreciate that and get on your hands and ease and kiss your radio speaker. Okay? Just give it a big wet one. You might catch something to the speaker, but that's okay too.

And be sure to tell them that Todd Dreck told you to come. Gordon gives out Florida a major blow job. All right. All we're fine. He was young and a restaurant for the boy. He didn't know that she was gay. Boy until he noticed each time they went out. She went for the seafood buffet. Okay. Just look at all those dikes. Sister's now. Just look what they have done. The minute she comes home from work to the door. Well off her panties come. She laid it down to stop publishing the rosy bag. Let the laid off staff not paid. And Rose is girlfriend who's pregnant. Right now I guess she just only got laid. There is a girl with extra white jeans. Better chain or she's become. And she goes by the name of Rosey oldie in the house of the lesbian. He says he hasn't David and Dethany and Dolphins and the Browsky and all of that crap. It's 18. Of course don't forget the Rick Dudley who put the Dudley. Five games under 500. Not too impressive. Okay. To break the news. You've got a lot of fine youngsters in the organization but it's just an uno. Gotta go to some games while I'm here as a matter of fact. You're going to be coming to the Panther Games George. No. Always many things. Why not? As many as you can miss. Here's the facts that I just don't understand. Maybe you can interpret because you're a sports ace. Well it's gotten off and I don't know a little bit to do with sports. Looks like a crazy sport. Good morning. The oldie here the latest news out of New York. Boomer of science and you know the boomer of course. Want to give you a rose of hug and a huge kiss. I want to give you a kiss. Have a great day. It says I don't understand that. I must miss something free hugs and kisses. They're going around. The boomer wants to. He said he'd like to kiss it. Just sniff it a little bit and kiss it. That's what he said. I want to give you a kiss. He leaves me limp the boomer. All of those ex-gences. Well not Danny Boy though. Who knows anybody see that picture in a hero? I'm sure I'm not the only one who noticed that. I assume for 50 million. That's what I would do Danny Boy. Then you don't have to take the job and embarrass yourself. He doesn't have to take the job. He doesn't have to take the job. Danny? Right. Maybe Wayne made of an offering couldn't refuse. You know what I mean? Oh, who knows? Marino, Harry is just a smokescreen. Rot any of the Pope. I'm ashamed that any of the rights are just scandalous, but very honest piece. At any rate, let's see the first poll we did yesterday was about the whole Danny Boy situation. Danny and Dave and Dave and Danny and Wayne and that of course don't forget Rick Spielmeister. You know about Rick Spielmeister? No who? Rick the Spielmeister. He's the new GM. He's the Spielman for the organization. Anyway, 582 votes yesterday. What's your take on the Dan Marino hiring? We had it. It's a PR stunt to pacify the doll fans. How many of you for almost 32 percent are buying into the edit poop thing? It's just a PR stunt. You know, he's just going to be a face man. Kind of like the president. Oh wait till we get that stuff about the Apollo and Neil book, which I got to go on by today. By the way, you didn't remind me. You didn't call it on me. Oh, go on by the book. I just was too lazy. Watch him too much hockey last night. How about that Brian McCabe, baby? All right. Nice going Brian. Stick another one in there. Danny's a winner. I like it. 161, 27.6 percent Danny's a winner. First what this has to do with that. I have no idea, but nevertheless I couldn't give a Schmidt less. 121. That's almost 21 percent who just really just exhausted by it already. Just in a couple of days. Can you imagine that about three months when you're still doing Danny and Dave and Dave and Danny and Rick Spielmeister? It won't change the thing 93 and I smell super bold. Oh, the stench of commoner. It's a 23 votes on that one out of 582. That was the first half of the show yesterday. Now wait till you hear this. And we do want to apologize profusely. Both Moe and yours truly want to upon not. I want you to understand. I don't want to get overboard with this thing. Or can't fact I'm hoping Moe is less than tuna. I don't want to get a little bit too carried away. It's like if like there's an nasty divorce in your separation. I like a year and a half later after a nasty hostile separation. I like on the first day. You don't want to like jump in a second and make mad wild monkey love. You don't want to say I'm over you do? Yeah, yeah you do. Oh, why don't want to do that yet? So then you might as well. And I noticed Moe this morning made it very clear that yesterday during our big meat out there in the parking lot. We were sitting on separate benches. He pointed about that. And that is correct. We will not be sure in the same seat. And anyway, the question was what's your take on a meal in Moe reunion? And as I started to say, we want to both apologize because this town thrives on hate and on division and on animosity. And so the fact that we had the skewed going on for a year and a half and the fact that we kind of meant it our fences now. We're like, you know, living amply side by each. That pisses a lot of people off. Well, tough to be. That's what I have to say to you. Okay? Because life is too freaking short. And I'm not suggesting that Moe is my best close personal friend now or likely ever will be. I think that's highly unlikely when you agree. Yes. What? Well, I'm not saying that. But at least though we get along fine. We see it where each one is coming from. And that's the name of that tune. Even the beast. And I got to say this before get to these poor results because I want to milk it. Even the beast is one of those people when you when you see him. But you know people like that, you can be mad at them from a distance. Right. But when you're around them and you see them and you can't stay mad at them. Do you know what I mean? He's one of those people. And you went through the whole thing yesterday about how you feel sorry for him. Right. It's the schmoo factor. He looks like the schmoo from Joe Paloca. Just a big ball of cuddly. I'm not going to contribute to the grief he's already got going on in his life. What is that mean? He's got enough baggage without people disliking him. And you know what I mean? No, but I'm saying when you and I can't I wouldn't agree. I don't think Moe would agree with this part. But I'm only speaking for myself when I see him. Like when I come in this morning, the first person I see in a bullpen in there sitting there pretending to be doing some work. But I actually look in a porno sites. It's the beast. And I just I can't be mad at him when I see him because he's just sad side. You know, it's not just that you want to like him. He's one of those people. It's got a effervescent personality. You want to like him. He makes it difficult to do. What is a jolly fat man? He's a very good. He could be sandy claws. He's a Jewish sandy claws. He's a jolly fat guy. You know, if he's a peeperotic as Miss, he keeps it up. He'll be a jolly dead fat guy. But nevertheless, there's that d word again. Dead. But not that's true. He better cut the crap. He could be said a clause. Santa Claus right for Hanukkah. For Tanuka. Anyway, we asked yesterday what's your take on the Neil and more reunion and we had 1213 votes that is shocking to me. So that means 582 and 12 are we had like 1,800 votes in one day's worth of polls. That's more of votes than the QM polls on their website gets in six years. In fact, not even six years. How about 30? Yeah. 1800 vote. That means there must be somebody out there. I don't give a Schmidt. 458 said that 38%. Well, I find that to be rather insensitive. Don't you? I don't give a Schmidt about our personal feelings here. In sensitive typical soft load excellent shot. Who's Mo? 229. Oh, absolutely. I'm shocked, but dismayed 228. See, shocked. But dismayed. In other words, it takes the joy out of there. And now we're still going to be playing the Mo bits. Right? Of course. We have a couple of new ones that, in fact, at one about the Davian in the Danny. You know, that's a character. Basically. Yeah, I was thinking that when I was shaving this morning, it's a miracle. I didn't slip my throat. No, no, seriously. It's amazing. Boca Brian, which I'm a big, big admirer. A huge fan of the work he does is a genius. A little bit off, but a genius. You can't have one without the other. But he has created these characters who are even so much more interesting than the real people. I mean, the Mo on there with all the respect to my new friend, Mo. The Mo that he created is certainly much more entertaining. The guilty he created is just phenomenal. And the Greg Reed who sounds like Jack Benny is so much more not only entertaining and interesting, but at least visible. You know, audible, visible. He's at least around as they should have. Those characters should have. Those characters should go. Those characters. Those characters. Those characters. Seriously. In fact, I'm going to mention that tomorrow. Why does he just like to say make that suggestion? He can take the checks, take the money to the bank and just sleep in later. We did a turn on a radio, laugh his ass off. And we just have the Mo, guilty in the Greg Reed show. And the, honey, it was by Joe Rose and Managed. Right. And the broke of Ryan can be like the Hans Conrad of the show. He can do all the voices. You know, like the Mel Mel, what's his name? Brooks. Not Mel Brooks. Who's the one? Who did all the voices? Oh, Blake. Mel, my, I was close. See Mel. Mel Allen. Mel, blank. Mel Brooks. Any other Mel with smell? The same. Because they're all dead, right? Isn't Mel Brooks dead? Yeah. So wait. No. No. Brooks isn't dead. He's not. We got that website of bookwork. I don't want to look at it. It's more fun. You're sure Mel works isn't dead. I'm not sure. What about Mel Blank is dead? Oh, yeah. Mel Allen is not. He's not even more anymore. Mel tour me. He helped her. May is very dead. Anyway, Shock, but this may, 220 and I really pissed off about the end of the feud. Greg Reed should have done this a long time ago. In other words, solving all the problems one away. He isn't. See, Greg doesn't solve problems. He creates them. That's what he's here for. He creates problems that he runs away in hides like a petulant child. I'm shocked, but please, 108. Well, it's bad for QAM 57. It's great for QM 26 out of 1215 votes and emotional outpouring of response from the psychotic soft old audience coming in a close second to the Danny and Dave and dolphin situation this weekend in terms of local news that make it in the newspapers that any of our student. I wouldn't be surprised on Friday morning if votes Jim Sarnian very jackass right, a very humorous piece. When you'll be expecting that this week in their broadcast sports columns are humorous piece. Right. I'm a sports section about the me and Moa reunion. Oh, the ginger and Moa reunion. You're expecting it? No. Because it's a bunch of deadheads in this town. See, if you look anyway, Chris Selkha, which writes a broadcast on a year column in the, I think it's a Toronto star. And it almost every day he writes it, not just once a week. And he actually says something, you know? Actually, and then he'll rip somebody in the answer. You know, that's a good. Like a real column. That's pretty interesting to read, too. I just mentioned that in passing, Barry and Jim Sarnian, boy, I've done a one thing between Jim Sarnian, Barry Jackass, who's the lovely of those to them. He feels beautiful. They make me feel fabulous when I look in the mirror. 27 past 10 at five, 60 WQM, dial a mattress. So make your back feel fabulous. And the rest you too.

And if you click on the story and then click on the original story, the link to the original story, there's a link within the story to the bus show in 30 seconds thing. You can see the ad. Right. Good ad. That's good. Not my favorite. I didn't vote for it. Maybe. But at any rate, it says the one depicting young children working on skilled menial jobs while a question is who will pay off bushes trillion dollar deficit. Supposedly it'll be shown during a super bowl. Somehow I see Fox or whatever network is broadcasting event, rejecting the ad that will be typically disgusting. They'll take the money. I'm sure. It's a kind of money to get in for those ads. They'll take the money. So click on it. It's the first story. And then go to the link to the original article. And then within the article, you'll find the link to the ad. Take a look. Take a puke at it. And see what you think. It's good. I still don't think it's the best one. Here's another facts from somebody who just can't control itself. Neal, the reason I fact that letter is your rose can't stand a boomer. Well, you know, I don't see. I don't use sports nerds out there. You don't understand. We got bigger fish to fry than freaking boomer a size. Plus doesn't have some kind of kid that's got like some kind of a uh, or yet some kind of a, I don't know is kid died or his some kind of a thing, you know? I don't like picking on people like that. They got personal tragedies. Do you? Yeah. What do you do? Well, depends on the tragedy. Sports be. It was something bad. I don't know whether we had a kid that died or had some kind of a horrible disease or he's off my radar to take on him or not. The boomer. Yeah. Well, you better get with him. Mr. You better know the boomer. So are you just the aim with a Schmidt? Okay. Now, here's today's poll question. It's going to take a long time the whole day. Now, you're going to be emailing these to Eric. Is that the conversation over what we'll see? Yeah. After fashion. Well, though, you can write them down. Right. Or I know I'll write them down. And then I'll periodically facts of the update on the list. How's that? I can write them down. There's a reason that I emailed them to him. Why is that? To expediate things for him. Yeah. I ought to be able to do it. I'm cleaning. Well, are you saying that's because you got that crappy old computer interview? No, of course. Well, I would say that. And because you're engineering department will give us absolutely no assistance whatsoever. And because muff is to busy running around crying like a little girl to like make them get there with it. See, he talks to good game them up. My string. He means well. That way, well, he means well. But of course, he's just a weekling. And of course, the program director. He's nowhere to be seen because he had a flat tire this morning. So we had to cancel his 85 very important meetings, including the one with Mo. That's clearance for you. Kind of like I'm sure he learned it from his superior. He only has one superior. And that of course would be great. He learned how to avoid and evade make all kinds of excuses, not answer messages, things like that. And he's learned fast. Here's the poll question that will be building during the show. And of course, I got a pile of stuff that's probably much more important. Who was your favorite all time? Are ready wrong? Who was your all time favorite TV character? Not TV show. We've done that a million times old boring. Not actor actress boring. We've done it many times. But who was your all time favorite TV character on any show? Archie bunker and Frank Cannon or the two we started with. Could have started with a whole bunch more, but why not let the audience finger it out. Well, I want to throw one in. Who's that? Homer Simpson. Homer Simpson. Homer Simpson. Okay. George likes those homos. That's why we're sunish show. They're my best friend. Homer Simpson. Some of those homers are his best friends. Of course I like homers like you a boon. At any way in my client, Rick Junior Red. Dean wins non-body DC primary. Beauty contest and Washington DC. I just pass it along. Does mean anything. Howard Dean won the first vote of the 2004 presidential campaigns season yesterday. Although it was more of a voting night's rally, voting rights rally, then it tends to express a preference for a candidate. I mean, we're talking doing that debate about making Washington a state. We already have one Washington state and it's like a big chunk of land. If we're going to make cities into states. Any kind of silly? Let's have the 75,000 states have to make the flag a lot bigger I guess. I'd be like having a city the size of an entire county. Yeah. Like Jacksonville. We do have some. There you go. Well, Jacksonville can be a state. New York certainly would be like two or three states north of the York and the Long Island and whatever. Don't worry. You got five burrows. Anyway, the former Vermont governor got 43% of the DC vote followed by Al Sharpton 34% Senator Carol Mostly Brown had 12% and representative Dennis Cassinatio about how I'd eight percent. You go blind. I scored Dennis. The other five major Democratic candidates for the party's presidential nomination were even on the ballot. No delegates were selected. That comes later in caucuses for board the 12 turn out was higher than in previous presidential primaries. That's good. That's a good sign. You hear that? With 12% of registered voters casting ballots compared to 8.4% in 2002, which means we're going to get everybody out this November and kick some serious bush. Yeah. That's right. We're going to surprise the crap audio. And of course in Washington, DC, you know why we're glad to get all in people out. You do know that. No, because most of them are. That's right. Oh, right. Gotta get you dark folks to vote this. No, remember four or five six times will pay a good money no matter what it takes. Right? Right. And then if we don't get to deserve it, we'll pay off the people a die bold. And this time we'll put the fix in to put it and all this fascist crap. What's in here? The thing about the um, the o'neal book. Wow, o'neal book paints ugly portrait of the bushmaster. WQAM. Neil. Answer. I had a TV accent with Rick Sanchez about 30 minutes ago. Oh, no. Oh, my god. Wait, you hear that? He says he's just getting a call from the White House on itself when he's listening to Neil Rogers on the radio. Wait, you hear what he says. I'm listening to Neil Rogers' girls. He's Neil Rogers. He's had a crush on me for a long time. That's what he says to the girl he's on his show. Unbelievable. We can't we can't. You better watch him fast, man. You won't seem too long. The only guy who ever ran somebody over didn't get trouble for it. Right? There were a couple about this. Remember that? Yeah. What's that? The guy still dead? Get heavy rate day pal. Quit boring us with the old tired crap. Okay. Leave that to me. Jesus. Remember that? Remember that? Get a life you mindless idiot. Quick pick it up. My good buddy. Ricky Tickie. Spickey. WQAM. Well, yet that thing. Fishman. Effect a column pop robot with a ton of our listening to these some engineering assistance. I'm sure he'd be bored inclined to help them out. That's because they hit us like poison. You know what, uh, course. So see, course was big and deficient. Isn't that correct? I don't know. You'd like to take one of them big treble hooks and just stick it in his push. 19 to 11 at five or maybe even a couple in his back. Don't want to need to cheat would be good. 19 before 11 at five, 60 WQAM. If you're on a diet like everybody in America because we're all big and fat.

The winner is a child's pay by Charlie Fisher of Denver. The ad shows young children working on assembly lines. Checking groceries working as janitors. The ad concludes. Guess who's going to pay off President Bush's trillion dollar deficit. It was chosen from 14 finalist each attack in the policies of the bushing administration and adds ranging from hard hitting to humorous and an ounce money that is celebrity-studded gala in New York City. It was like I said, it was good. Not the best. It was good. Didn't get my vote. And they were either. They obviously don't care about my vote or you're either. Uh, Gary says as far as the beast is concerned. Not a very kind thanks about our good friend the beast says I wouldn't be so kind about talking about the beast. I was listening on Sunday and he was taken shots at you in George. Well, that's out of a bitch. He was mentioning how George records everything when you're in the studio or in the John and feeds it to Neil for you slayed Iran. See, first of all, you can't even get a right. I'm going to record the stuff up in Toronto. Right. The second one to us and feed it to myself and fed it down here and fed it on the air. I'm feeding everybody. Says I'm personally not crazy about the beast. I wish they would take his fat ass and homer lists off the air. He doesn't do anything for me. But he does a lot for Clarence is what I'm hearing. You know what I mean? Squared square he catch my drift. In fact, he admitted to me this morning that he was the reason that Clarence was late this morning to work. Not a flat tire. He said he had a flat back to him because the beast wore my last night. And it deflated ego. Okay, here's some for our now Adam Stainins. Isn't this the same one? Right. That's why he just tear it up. Right. That's him. Correct. Okay. In addition to which we're not going to have a list of 6,000 here. It's just we don't want to impose an Eric that much. Do we? Well, I can't go to be doing that stuff too long. Does he know that yet? More or less that we're working on the bed time series. That way I'll be more comfortable in like doing like 20 or 30 or even some days 50 if need be to really have their website. Because we don't want to take too many hours of Eric's exercise time. That's right. Or too many hours off his eaten time. And also because look at this facts. Captain Kirk. Okay. I can't read the rest of this. It said to love the show. Neil God. Something. Okay. Whatever it says. Okay. Captain Kirk. There you go. You're right knees down. Yeah. How about baby Stewie? On family guy. What is family guy? It's not bad. Is that like a family tie? It's cartoon, but you will. So you will. Wow. Incredibly funny. Well, we don't care what it is. It can be a cartoon animated character. It can be like a Batman some action hero. The only problem is if somebody says Superman, what do we do then? We've had so many Superman characters. Did you not say it all the time? Yeah. But that's my point. There are you can't compare it to Superman from like, we don't know. We'd like Dean Gray. But then we would have to change. Or like with Jared Reeves. Which portrayal of a character? Why? It's all the same character. There are different portrayals. Okay. Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it on the river cry. Let's see. The audience doesn't care who what you rip as long as it's something. People especially down here love to hate. Well, no Schmidt. Congratulations on your per se pay a Cassidy. I wanted to mention that there are consistently excellent articles exposing the Bush administration in Rolling Stone magazine and a link called Slate Magazine available directly from the MSN homepage, correct or MSSlate.msn.com. Plates also got great stuff on the Democratic candidates and in their archives. Thank you very much for reminding me. You can never have too many websites. I do like village voice by the way. I mean, that's not the same great revelation. But the village voice got some great columns and we put several of my highly prestigious website. By when we got to do something with this list, okay? Because there's only three names. We probably shouldn't have put it up yet. Do you think you could take the pull down? I don't want to like get all over Erick's ass. God who would want to get near it. But no seriously. I don't want to like to put too much work on his ass. But the fact that I'm at a resistance, I'm putting up a pull with three and then right into it. Let's build the first animal put it up there. Right? It's like a Brooklyn Bridge. Let's build a nice animal stick it up. Oh, here's a good one from TomPain.com. I don't want to get too noisy today because they get some people very upset and you know what screw them? Fugum. Pearls wisdom. This is very short right to the point I like this one a lot. It says nothing in Noble's nation more than citizens who showed are the burdens of where it's at wartime. Nothing degrades the nation more than those who lobby for war while enriching themselves on its spoils. Think Richard Pearl. You can't miss in these days. He and his colleague David from are all over TV promoting their new book and end to evil. Their plan over throw Iran's government, blockade North Korea, force regime change in Syria, squeeze China, isolate France, pull out of the UN and more. It's a breathtaking blueprint, but there are incredible architects after all it was they who said that Iraq was teeming with weapons of mass destruction, that US forces would be welcomed with open arms, that who sane had ties to Al Qaeda, that Ahmed Chalabi of the Iraq National Congress would be a popular leader they were wrong on all accounts. And then there are Pearls questionable business deals, as he agitates for war he advises companies who profit for more. Last year for instance he briefed investors on ways to make money from US conflicts with North Korea and Iraq. Such controversies forced him to step down as chairman of the Pentagon's defense policy board, but didn't resign from the court itself he can still offer his clients to lay this inside scoop. This kind of track record would send most arm-shared generals limping back into private life, but that hasn't happened to Pearl. He still has the president's ear and not one interviewer, not Charlie Rose, not NBC's Matt Lauer, not CNN's Wolf Blitzkrieg, has forced him to fully answer the conflict of interest charges. They should. Just as they should question his predictions about Iraq, because what's at stake is not just one's man's credibility, but the lives of the hundreds of thousands of men and women who risked their lives no matter where they sent the battle. Good column at compane.com. Richard Pearl, big tub of crap. Not seen son of a bitch, him and the wolf-awaited in a whole crowd, cheney, and their puppet. Everybody's got a puppet of figurehead. That's why this other thing and it makes me want a puke. CNN, all Americans like Bush's qualities, Paul said, well, I've got that right. In other words, he never stole a freight train. They like the way he threw down home. You know, proper Texas kind of yuck, yuck. What is that kind of thing? It means on the podium there. Yeah. And all of this coming right on the heels of that thing on 60 minutes. It's almost as though that show was never on the air. Right. Well, and of course we know that Paul and he is a bad guy. Everyone who played right field for the Yankees. You think any of those people watch 60 minutes? No. I'd even for 60 seconds. Maybe. Maybe before they get the, you know, remote and change the channels again. You go back to their football game. That's an overtime. 5605060, that's where we took the pull down nice going. Eric, well, let's you know, we'll get back to you. That's have at least you know, a couple of dozen on there before the cast of vote because when we get some other suggestions here, if ever, takes some damn phone calls, then then we put something, just oh, gee, I wish you would voted for this and your vote is so important to us. Isn't it? No. Yeah, it is. Right. It's important to Eric every time somebody votes under him. He makes $100. What? That's what I heard every, every vote that's cast in our pulling makes $1000. It's a pain. That's why Eric would like it by change the pull every hour. Yeah, let's do four pull. Let's do one every half hour deal because every, every vote that we get on a pull I make $10,000. Now, see, here you go. I'm throwing these away. Here's one with a list. I'm not interested in the list. This is got like 10 names on it. We have to like educate the audience here. We have to like reform this audience. A lot of you need to go to we, here you go. Al Bundy, Mike says, there's short and sweet. I can't. There's the question you ask and the one they want to answer. Right. The one they want to answer is how many characters can you name? Right. I mean, I can name you 50,000. Right. Maybe not 50, but leave out. But here's Mike who got it. I'm Al Bundy. Anna Rosanna Dana. What was, how about Ellie Anna Rosanna Dana? What the hell was her name? Rosanna, Rosanna, Dana. Rosanna Rosanna, Dana, she was great. God, I loved her. She's still dead, but I never find a hair on a piece of soap. How do you spell that? Just like it sounds. I don't know. Well, you'll figure it out. Rosanna, Dana. I don't know how to do it. She was the best. She was married to Gene Wilder 2. I don't know. She involved is a very funny guy, but he's been in some pretty crappy movies. What was that? We saw her streak. Yes. With him in Richard, Richard, Brian. I was, I tried watching that. I did watch it. But it was so weak. I saw her streak was pretty weak. Stir crazy was better. Okay. And what about your own Frankenstein? Well, go to that. Say it. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless on your all-time favorite TV character. Let's get with it. Let's stop it all. Let's have a duty political stuff and be in so newsy. Although I do have WQM. Hello. Yeah. Grafts, pick the nail. Speaking. Hey, how you doing nail? Pretty damn good. I wanted to put a name into the poll. Oh, Uncle Arthur from BWIP. Uncle Arthur was good. Paul in. Yeah. Okay. You got it. Oh, okay. Thanks. Have a great day. He's still dead by the way. Paul in. All the great characters are mostly dead, aren't they? Oh, it can be from a current show. There are some good characters on current shows like, um, and then there's, uh, right? Well, you don't watch any good pressure. No, I don't watch any current show. You watch passions. You watch things that nobody else watches. Nobody watches passion. Nobody watches the maybe three other people and, uh, spike on Buffy the vampires later. Watch passions. You're so full of crap. All right. Patients has a cult following. Hi. How many we got? About 30 man. That's right. He's a Timmy dies. There's no point. Now since Timmy dies it's pretty slow. I wish this thing would Julian and Eve already. Enough with a passion of kissing and with TC and, uh, poorer with Neoji. My mother's a slot. Yeah. I mean, if we need more of Mrs. Wallace, we need more of Edda and precious the chimp. Mrs. Wallace, some bets, Ma with her with her colostomy bag or whatever she's got her diapers. She wears, she wears depends. Okay. She keeps paying her pants. Yeah. I mean, what other soap opera can you name it with the old scene I'll leave you the walks with the walkery ways in her pants and has, and her hair take her is a, uh, orangutan. Huh? Don't call him a, her a chimp. Though it's a orangutan who's in love with Louise by the way and his brother Miguel. Man, oh man, can you imagine the drugs they take before they write them episodes on passions? It's great. And we got the lovely Sheridan who's locked in a rubber room now. She probably wishes she was back down there and epit least she got a little fresh air. Huh? She's in a rubber room in a freaking straight jacket. Then we got Alistair, uh, Rally. Alistair who we never see. We only see his arms and his big, uh, Stokey smoking, which I wish he'd put the ashes on. At least the other day, finally, flick the ashes first time at about a year and a half. Flick it, just flick it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. So I know you're right because I know how much I want hockey football. The new shows are not yet, but the ones on FX. I'm gonna say it again. I'm gonna say it again. I watched more and spot all these so-called sports experts. We have on this radio station. I watched more sporting events in one weekend than these people watching their lifetime. Just like all our so-called football experts during the football season. We got Mo and, uh, and, uh, mad dog for example, are at the dolphin game to win a game. Do they see any of the other games? No. They see a Monday night game. That's about it. Uh, hockey anybody in this station wants hockey beside me and get a little. No. No. So, I mean, I risk my case. But, oh, oh, oh, no, I don't know. He's just a pansy. You don't know nothing about sports. Right. Right. No nothing. Just like about how to Patriots were lucky. See even though Mo and I have meant it our fences to some point, this business about the Patriots being lucky. I forgot to mention that yesterday we were sitting across on our own individual benches. I'll remind him of that for the next chat tomorrow morning. 10th. 10th of the 7. Listen, like I said, let's not overdo it. The beginning. Let's ease back into it. You understand? I don't want to. You just want to jump into it too heavy duty. Okay. You know, if the beast closes the door too fast, you could lose about 16 pounds. Yeah, that might do it. Try give it a try. Close it real fast. Then they're in the door. Didn't work. See, is he just, I don't know, chorobic. Churubic? Sure. He's a schmobic. 10 58 at 5. 16 W Q M if your carpets need some help after the holidays.

But it had more people that line up last night that I never even heard of before. Who the hell were they? But anyway, they look pretty good. Thank goodness. Oneal book paints ugly portrait abortion. Former US Secretary Treasury Paul Oneal's portrait with a George W. Bush to pick say passive and superficial president sounds right on so far surrounded by right wing ID logs who elect the intellectual rigor or even the curiosity to think through the effectiveness policies. You know, something that paragraph right there should be on every TV show. It should be on everything on elf everywhere. Don't you think? Absolutely. I'm going to read it again and before I get to a little bit of the rest of it. And this is on our website. Oneal book paints ugly portrait abortion. At least I think it is. Former US Treasury Secretary Paul Oneal's portrait a George W. Bush to pick a passive and superficial president surrounded by right wing ID logs who elect the intellectual rigor or even the curiosity to think through the effectiveness policies. In detailed recollections of cabinet infighting and his own one-on-one meetings with Bush's recounted appeal to the press when he journalist Ron Susskahn, Oneal provides a rare insight into an unusually secretive administration in glimpses of a present with sometimes unusual priorities. Susskahn's book The Price of Loyalty for which Oneal was the principal source when on said yesterday, the Treasury Department on Monday asked for an investigation into whether classified document was displayed during a CBS TV interview with Oneal that aired on Sunday. Right. In the book Oneal says that, you know, somebody made a very good point. I think was Paul the Galon Crossfire yesterday. Look how long it took them to start the investigation into Valerie Plains outing at the CIA. Yeah. Because of the vendetta we can show as if Wilson or husband. Uh, there's still not to do. We still don't have any answers on that yet. But the day after 60 minutes airs on CBS and Paul Oneal's on there, Dragon Immout of the Closet, oh, well, we're thinking of conducting an investigation. And in Cory that is. Anyway, in the book Oneal says the tone of the relationship with Bush was said that they're very first meeting, where he was offered the job of Treasury Secretary. Instead of a detailed discussion, Bush was more interested in why the cheeseburgers eat ordered were slow to appear. He interrupted the talk to someone White House Chief of Staff and your card. You're the Chief of Staff. You think you're getting up to getting some cheeseburgers, Oneal recalled Bush saying card noted no one laughed he all but raced out of the room to get the cheaper cheever. You could have called John Bolushi, he'd have brought him. If he weren't dead. In the first White House reaction at the interview in the book spokesman Scott McCulland said Monday Oneal's criticism appears to be more about trying to justify personal news and opinions than it does about the results we are achieving. Right. What a lame comeback that is. Uh, we're talking doughed over it is what we're talking. Just like I've been telling you all along. But don't confuse the American public like that because it's the the S S H word that comes into play here. The S H word stupid. Never leave that on your side stupid. What was your all-time favorite TV character? We got our cheap bunker Frank Cannon, Hummus Simpson, Baby Stewie, Captain Kirk Al Bundy, Rosanne Rosanna Dana, Vid A Uncle Arthur, Lucy Ricardo and Kramer so far. Is that been a while? Yes. Okay.

In the meantime, let's have about 4,000 more suggestions between now and 2 when a mad dog comes along. Here's that schedule again. Not 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T, and Verizon wireless line. Don't forget we got the heavy-duty snelty, the pants of game. Oh, wait. This is a mistake. Panthers aren't anthill at L. F. You're the right day. I'm not the right day. They're filled out. They're home against Philadelphia tomorrow. I think how else could we have been given away tickets to the Panther game? But it's not a be a home game. They just came home this morning. They would have been coming back here if they were going to Philadelphia. They just came back from Calgary. Like I said. So we got that game and we got the Panthers and Calgary on Saturday. Is that right? Oh, this isn't right. This thing is just, oh, you know what? This is last week's schedule. What is this crap? What is wrong with you people? This is last week's fugun schedule. I'm reading here. I'm looking at all of these things. Yeah, they weren't filling. They won over time for the three. The game is over. I bet you any outcome. I bet you Stevie Westwood's a winning goal in over time. It about 306 of O.T. Anyway. So I'm giving you all the wrong information. And nobody cares. Nobody says a thing inside here. That goes to show you man. No wonder clearance ain't showing up today. No wonder buff is in there with tears rolling on his cheek. I don't want to tell you which cheek's either. So look at this. We got, uh, I'm not going to see Hank. This week. He's not even here. I missed my opportunity. Hank is at the Crystal Palace in Bahamas this afternoon doing a show and again tomorrow. And, uh, oh no, he'll be back Friday. So we got the mad dog at you. The Humper at the Crystal Palace. He were came to warm up with seven. Hurricanes are saying John's at the 730. Eddie came to the basketball. Joe and Mark overnight. So we just had the wrong opponent. But we don't have no pants or game tomorrow. The pantiers are playing a Tampa Bay on Saturday. Right at the Mac Arena. So so what did that mean? What was that contest that, uh, I don't get it. Get what? That thing that we just had from yesterday was your cost. It'll be not giving you tickets to the Panthers and fliers. I don't even know when the highlight game is. And I'm looking at the schedule. I'm saying Thursday night's Game against the fliers. You people ought to be in jail, man. This is the most bogious freaking place. She and Toronto. I don't have these problems. Because you guys fast me the schedules. I put up in front of my post and it's all right there. And I know what we come in. I know what planet I'm on. Whether I'm here or in your rainous. But this is just a mess. This is a mess. I'd be embarrassed if I was you clearance and you two moth week sisters. The week sisters of the poor. That's our crowd. 5605050 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. And what the hell kind of naked pictures is the Humper God to be doing his show out of town zone.

Could be Frank anybody. Could be Frank's not for a. Did Frank's not for Junior just die or was that my imagination? That's your imagination. Are you sure? No. I saw crawl. See the problem.

But my head was pounding from trying to watch it from like this bizarre angle. And then and he's right.

I heard you do in the promo yesterday for Cache Bellow, but I didn't get a chance to call it See there reason I kept saying for Thursday night's game against the flyers is because they had last week schedule on there It's a defliers in the pants. There's not me. Oh, just getting sucked into that comes to find out that was about the game in fully last week Right, it'd be nice if QAM would send somebody up to silly, but God forbid.

Nori won't know where he will be there! Nori won't be there, nori won't be there! I'll never switch the bagels! I'll finger-point-handling the buck to the sweaty hits of lettuce. I've done about everything we've punched and have a veggie betty. I've swallowed many zooms to make too big. They hear this tickle, and even though I love these things, I will not switch the bagels. Nori won't know where he will not be there! Nori won't be there, nori won't be there! Nori won't be there, nori won't be there! Nori won't know where he will not be there! Nori won't know where he will be there! Nori won't be there! Nori won't be there! You asshole? Fourteen til noon at five, 60, WCM, WDs levels are all over the place. They must be poshking in the arthing. They might be ditto around in the arnith, they've got to lock it up while we're not on the air. Anyway, somebody says a columbo, somebody said perimation for our list. Here's the poll question. Just for fun. Who is your all-time favorite TV character? Like I said, not just for fun, but for a scientific and important. Isn't it? No, yeah, it is. Archie bunker is winning with ten votes. Albundy eight. Poll is up by the way, can you hop on it. Homer Simpson, 16, 70, 70, 505, Hawkeye, Pierce five. Herman Monster two. Lucy Ricardo two. Basil Faulty two. Baby Stewie one, Frank Cannon one. I was my vote. I voted for him because nobody else will. I think it's Basil. I said basil. That's right. Razzle bathbone. Uncle Arthur one. Detective Arthur D trick one. See it's a brick thing. So I don't really care because they're just, Oh, the only good thing out of Britain ever ever ever was a Monti-Eopithon. I was in Enda Clockwork Orange. Mom, I'm not talking about movie. Oh, I'm talking about like TV shows. There were people who watched that upstairs downstairs that suit, suit, crab, you know. Oh, God. Good thing served. No, how about the prisoner? That was good. That was pretty good. Oh, and um, what do you use that? That's that British. Absolutely fabulous. What is that? Ab Fab, the two chicks. You're asking me was the prisoner British? I think it was during the long time ago. He was Irish, actually. Patrick McGoon. No votes yet for anybody. What we just got to think up there. We got about 40 votes. Whatever it is. Or maybe just. Fuck. To hop on it. 560, 560, pound, 560. Those are my favorite. Like that fact said, just got to work. He plenty more of those coming. Okay. It makes for a very amusing reading on a year. It also shows up on a bunch of assholes. You right wingers are. Oh, we used to like you so much better when you didn't talk about politics. What was that? What was that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know either from the day that I came on here in his town. Almost how many years now? Fuck. I've been talking politics. I'm all continuing to do so. It's fun of the desperate attempts. Well, I used to be your ratings sucked out. You know what blow it out your ass. Take your arbitrarian diary and wipe your ass with it. Okay. Rush liquor. Well, I think they'd be a bush liquor. But I guess there's some similarities there and out too. Brush liquor is in Rush liquor. I guess that's how you write Rush down on the diary and pill poppers. Yeah. Fony. Talk about hypocrites. Albundy 12. Just move to head of Archie Bunker. I can't believe that. Can we? Albundy. Yeah. Outside out of mind. Yeah. That was. That was. I didn't like that show at all. It was funny for the first couple of free seasons. He was just annoying. Yeah. I mean Archie Bunker was funny. Eideth was funny. How come nobody said Eideth was proud of him? How come nobody said Eideth Bunker? Put her down. Huh? I did. Archie used to all the time. Eideth. Eideth Bunker. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if somebody don't say meathead. Huh? Meathead was good. Although he's a liberal now, we don't want to get too excited about him. Who? Who's he supporting? Is he supporting Dean? No, no. No, you. He's been the prince in a mile with somebody. I think it was Dean or maybe it was a card. I don't know. Well, no, he doesn't think he does. Delay. So he wasn't with West Clark. Five, six, seven, oh, five. No, sirs. Can you explain that to me? That's got to be the dumbest thing. Although the new new Hampshire poll showed, um, what I don't want to say the numbers. I don't want to. Well, I know that Clark was up to like 20%. He passed carries into second place. And if he can come out second in New Hampshire, that puts it in pretty good position. Because you know, uh, good old retired degenerate, Wesley Clark is going to be really strong in South Carolina and Oklahoma and all them military kind of like, uh, Gustav and states. Don. Right. So he may have a shot. Don't don't, uh, think this thing is over yet. Dennis Cassin is for president, baby. I don't care what anybody says. He run. He talks rings around these guys. He's in shoulders above. I'm not the head part. Got that bad piece. In fact, now that I'm tight with more, well kind of like, a little tight. Maybe we can borrow one of his pieces and like Dennis use it. Huh? That'll finish him off. WQA and hello. Yes, sir. Okay. I got some additions to your poll. One mail. One. One. Okay. First of all. Okay. Uh, how about the Louis de Pama and taxi, probably by Danny DeVito? Okay. Louis, the why? DePama? Louis de Palmer. I'm not going to put the uh, shows on because first of all, it's too much work for air. I can number two if you don't know who the, who the uh, character is, then you know, and then you shouldn't be voting anyway, right? Right. What if you don't know the character's name like the guy from everybody loves Raymond. But you have a line. Ryan DePama. Five, six, seven, five, sixty pound. Five, sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Hey, this is going to go on for hours and hours. Like about a couple of months. We don't have to worry. What do you say? We'll talk about whatever the mood strikes. And what is a story like to think about Paul O'Neill. What did this scraise it is? What did this scraise? This person is made out of teflon. What's the hard way diamonds? What's the hardest to platinum? Diamonds. Diamonds are the hardest surface known to man on the face of the earth. Right. Hard stuff. Forget about platinum. Forget about teflon. This man has got a diamond exterior. You can't scratch him. You can't touch this. Have a nice sentence. For months now he could come on TV and hold a press conference. Say he lies to us. He talked about everything and have a nice day. And let's give the cheeseburger's broad in here. And it would change nothing. And immediately we go. But like that. Oh, there's a lot of chatter going on. Yeah. Raise that alert back up to red this time, I think. Kind of divert everybody's attention. Right. WCQAM. Hello. Hey, no. Yes, sir. Come a quick thing. First of all. Yeah. Basil Fati is said there was nothing good out of eye. The ringlonding. I never saw that show. Well, it was John police from Monty Paisar. And he was like I said that was a great show. He was the best. And then the second thing is, why are he day with dad playing stuff? And he's not a great character but Basil hasn't beat. Okay. And they went off. What is it? One more thing I was on hold yesterday for now because I had a song for you for your thing yesterday. You will like it. Right. Go ahead. My enemy as they want that. He hasn't got a clue. We thought that way and with kin as asked. We thought that day was true. When call them in and let them get them to more years. And I didn't know Reno to pass the five of them in. Not bad. See you. Yeah, that's right. He did his departure. I never got back to my Eddie Pope column. You know what? Before we the doctor Heathcliff Hustable. Oh, I want to die. I want to die. Hey, listen. Somebody liked him. You haven't mentioned they knew the one comedy that's out. Well, first of all, it wasn't known to one, Alejandro. But it was the one to two. I guess it used to be known to one where we were on nine to one. It used to be like the one to two are comedy bits on ones. They and it's the one here today. We took a poll on it. We did it to the old Democratic way. See, we don't fix the. We don't rig the results on a poll. Like certain election people do. Oh, and then I saw you know who I lost on my respect for. I got a Michael Putney. Our old friend Michael Putney a channel. Yeah. Boring Michael Putney. He writes a column in a hero today. Sock and Katherine Harris is asked. And about how she's not going to be no boring Paula Hawkins. And she could be really dangerous if she runs in the Adi Adi. And she's so bright and he read her book. You know, Michael Putney, you are such a schmuck. It's people like you that are tearing our democracy apart. And that's I'm good. I'm crushed. Yeah. Michael Putney of all people evil. Sock and up to an election fixing evil obnoxious money. Governor, uh, Lickon, uh, bush bitch. And sucking her ass. What? What did this grace that was? I couldn't believe it. How much I'm afraid they get. I pray that she runs for the Senate and Florida. Because what's going to happen is that the just like his name predicted that or rehash it or really we invigorate all the people pissed off about 2000 again. The ones who are just in franchise, the ones who weren't allowed to vote. The ones who with the victims of the big fix. And they're going to come out and just kick some ass in Florida. The ones who's yard drawer shredded during the situation. The situation's people right. That's well. That's your beef. That's right. The impact. You know something that's, uh, that's the least of her. And what does that tell you about her? Mm-hmm. Not that she's got that, uh, a little conflict of interest that money grew in bitch. They after Dan, marino hiring is just a smoke screen. Soziti Pope is the story. Well, not to away. Now they're Wayne Heizing. I'm not going to read the whole thing. It's very long. Now the Wayne Heizing is created the most spectacular. Diversion and dolphins considerable history. Let's see how it works or it doesn't. Dan marino, the greatest passerover, puts it nine to five days at a desk. As senior vice president of football operations. I don't think so. Soziti, the pope dope. When new general manager Rick the Spielmeister requires a player. What does Dave wants that have to do if he wants to cut that player? Get Spielman's permission. And then marino's. This alone we know what it has to continue on page eight. Uh, and that often's a new command bag amazed. You can't slap a pencil instead of a football and marino's hands and say what's certainly go get a boy's. Danny was the best and that makes you the best. If they want to call him and ambassador fine, he'd be all of that and more. He could smooth with ticket buyers and potential ticket. He is to the dolphins. What Bernie Cosa was supposed to be the Panther organization. Remember that? Of course you do. He stood right in the doorway there. And wanted me to bring him in on a show. And waste my time. Bernie Cosa, you remember that? No. Yes, you do. He was standing there. And then you're kicking our cuschool girl. We bought the Panther as we did. Oh, that's silly. That's right. Silly goose. Bernie Cosa. Didn't it work? No. Bernie still around. No. You're not fooling anybody. Once you can bitch out our Mondo cell garrows and everybody else in the media audio one, I just cannot stand. I have no room in my life for billionaire assholes. We're always bitching everybody out of the business with him and suck their ass. Same old tired crap, man. Hey, Wayne, we're tired of you and your balls bought. Pack it up and get lost. And if you think you're fooling anybody with Dave wants to invite away all those bills and patriots and Jeff fans and everybody else, we love it. Keep on saying give him like a lifetime contract sounds good to me. Oh, right. Sounds excellent. And in fact, any Jones a quarterback this year. Your whole he is. No. 50560. 5060. On the effect he's going to have a walk around the sidelines. This year's going to be patient up and on the sidelines with a walker. Kind of like in the Wallace on passions.

Somebody says Sergeant Schulz from Hogan's Heroes got it. Got it. Somebody says Jury and buddy to Sprainsus. One of our fine facts are says. I'd like to suggest Jim Rockford for today's poll is a great character. Isn't that Jim, James Gardner's a great actor. He's comfortable every now and then someone needs some comfort TV. Yeah, my Clayboy TV is comfortable. That wasn't a bad show either. I can't punch up the audio from Clayboy TV here. Like I do when I'm in Toronto. Even though we're paying for the satellite service. Right. I don't even want to get on the TV. I'm even one. Yeah. Right. Two years. We haven't gotten it. But they're paying for it. That's good. The economy needs a different way. We can say something about it. And then they'll come in and unplug it. Right. And then they'll put a fucking card in there. So that's not a... They can't even get like a pirate card in here. That's how we're in a competent there. My favorite TV character is Mr. Effing Spock's. Somebody got that down. Mr. Spock. He's good. Love them ears, man. And word is good as who's likely we see with a bad ears. That Brittany's husband. Oh yeah. That's a criminal. That Redneck that Yahoo from Louisiana with a bad ears. Holy cow. Holy moly. And she thinks she's been doing it. You think she actually saw it? You think he's got one? Wow. No, there's something wrong with her. Yes. Maybe too much booze. Maybe too much fame in an early age. I mean, not enough sex with me. Maybe she's a dick. Maybe she got turned on when she stuck her throat down and down as a person. Maybe she's doing tennis right now. Because maybe she enjoyed the slap over. It's one thing that I have a sleepover, Brittany, but out of a slapover. So much of that fantasy. Yeah. Well, she's unpear now. She's unpear. She's unpear. She-it-tainted. Woo! We, man. Paint the tank. Take her to the lead. It's pristine. No more. She kind of clean, but she ain't pristine. Says the old queen. I'm-I'm telling ya. It may be mean, but... Here's somebody says, um... J.R. Ewing from Dallas. I remember at the time I was single told any of my dates to pick me up after Dallas and I couldn't miss one episode. Says a Laura. Yes, I need to get the life, but he was the best. Yeah, J.R. and he's on the verge of death. That's me, I know. Everybody like- Everybody like, uh, Larry Hagman. Be my-about a half a second. We said this last week. He's 20 more- 20-mar-20 Martin son. Mary Martin son. She's also dead. She was in that bad car crash with somebody. Here's to go. Don't you remember that? Pinky York. Yeah, well, I think what James Dean, she was sitting in the- She was riding shotgun. Did we get drunk off? How many of you? How many of you? How many Hagman's a champagne drunk? Did we get drunk? Oh, that's right. He's the liver. He's got the head of liver transplant, and they keep the shove it in more bacon and more onions and they get frying it up and it ain't working no more. They even took it off the menu at the GR grill. You know, the saddest thing was that the old- Was it called not Robinhood? That wasn't Detroit. What the? That was an image that grill at the, um, Stardust and Vegas? Did you- did we ever go in there for a list? No, the Rosewood grill was a fancy restaurant. Oh, this was like an old-fashioned, uh, diner. Like, you know, from American graffiti that kind of old-fashioned diner. It was great. I think we just had to walk through it through the style. Like the little burgers in there, you know, the little little castle burgers. It was just a greasy spoon kind of diner. And I think the last time I was in Vegas, they changed it. I think there I could be wrong, I'll take some. Although kitty cord of that is Ethel M's candies. See sooner or later, I'll always get around to that. Ethel M, did you ever have Ethel M's when you were in Vegas? Sure. Not if they had it at the Imperial Palace. Oh, that's right. Ethel Imperial Palace that dumps that we stayed at that time. Yeah. That's the stuff that I like. Except the crunch. Oh, my god. I could eat pounds of that. I mean, what a way to die. Sure. You know, I'm talking about the square. The little like home in Roca, but it's almost as good as those, uh, Rogers, almond brittle. Oh. So you're lucky you weren't here with the box of the. That's the only reason I'm still here. See, like I said, Canada's got too much name, good ice cream and candy. Oh, and Paul Martin and Bush talked the other day. And he did not call Bush a moron. He just kind of went like, look at that. So not everybody's a real happy and Canada will be allowed to bit on the contracts in Iraq. And we're going to be mad, count on it, no more. It's all in North America. Not just finger pointing no more. Yeah. I think Martin looked at him and said, how's it going, eh? And that kind of threw him off. A little bit. 560560. See there you go again. Fashion our president. That's a see as soon as you saw that word in the facts. That's all you need to know. Forget about Russian and about misfog. How about Schmack, Drek, whatever his name is. Our dictator. But it's unpatriotic to criticize the president. Of course, a president was getting blow jobs on a site. Then it was very patriotic to talk about that. And what's the point of the blue dress on? I like that. That's right. That was very important. About that sperm. Good. We're a science woman. That's absolutely correct. We're the ones. Thousands of people that were dying and some people getting the money. But now there's $3,00 deficit. That's unpatriotic to point of finger with that. So Paul or Neil.

The conservative talk host who's getting squeezed out and going eventually now, be renewed and getting a screwed over by clear channel because he came out against the war. Who? See, when you work for a cheap channel, you don't have a choice. Right. So it is not, I don't think Phil Henry is saying anything that he really believes. He's just singing the party line and actually understand that. You know what's called survival. You got to get a chat. I don't admire that, but at least he's doing what he needs to do. And if he would deny it, I don't believe him for a minute. Right. You got to eat. Because they're not going to put anybody to the left of a till the hunt on the year on cheap channel. And if they have anybody on their who is or doesn't go step the company line, they're going to be gone when and out, squeeze them out. Like Zitz, when and out. Squeeze them out. Carter to campaign with Dean and Georgia. Former vice president, former vice president, a former president. I know it's pretty embarrassing. Jimmy Carter will offer words of praise for Howard Dean when the Democratic Frontwater 10 Search Services with him in Georgia. On the eve of the Iowa caucus is eighth to the two men said yesterday. Dean campaign manager Joe Trippie said they didn't expect Carter to make an endorsement, but they were excited about appearing with the former president so close to voting in Iowa. Carter was said he will not express any preference about who should be the nominee. Or any sexual preference either. A short support from Carter could boost Dean's appeal in the South. Carter a Baptist could also help Dean and reasoned effort to appeal to religious voters. Carter son chip has also been campaigning for Dean Nio. You know, chip Carter the moment like one year where is the left eye supposed to be? No. Well, it's a southern thing. You know, kind of like Chelsea Clinton and Benjaboy and Benjaboy. They're all from the same. They had the same family tree. And they grew up in a tree house, I think. But neither said that about the deep South. I know a lot of you think I'm making a crap up, but just kind of look around you. Although here the same, this ain't exactly the same. After drive like out in the country to see the deep North. Yeah, get into the deep South. That's right. Go North up into like, oh, could show me not too far north or pojo key. Or like maybe get out there on the alligator rally and stop in a mockery and have some going to Indian cuisine. Just keep going to your smelly fart. Look at that corn. You know, that, what do they call that? Barbecue corn. You ever had that? Yeah. Put the corn in a tin foil and put a barbecue. I love that. It's like almost burnt. Right, aren't. Necred? It is. I love that. Probably causes cancer, but I like it a lot. But then again, what does, is there anything it doesn't cause cancer? Right. Causes cancer. Right. Plus all that crap we discovered they've been forcing us to eat all the meat, the byproducts and the mongam, the zeroes and the water-boiled cows. And the hormone fed all the chickens that are just jammed in are all stressed out. And we're eating them. I do like my steak though. It's crisp. And I before I came back here, man, I had a male Ruth Christ that would knock your socks off. I had those sauteed mushrooms. The French onion soup with the thick cheese baked on all of them. And I had me a river-stick medium-wheel. See, Ruth Christ, when you order a steak. And I told them to hold the butter because the butter makes me a crap. My brains are. And you don't need the butter. I like the butter. Well, that's because you don't have any stomach problem with it. Yeah. I do. Well, you know my tender stomach. So juicy and so delicious. That's one of the best hunts of meat I've ever had in my mouth. Believe you me. Oh, this story from yesterday, which of course nobody is talking about because nobody cares because we just, we just did a roll over and played dead. Okay, whatever you guys say, Supreme Court upholds police roadblocks. Oh, I saw that. I'm just excited about that. Oh, great. The Supreme Court does not see bastards on the Supreme Court rule yesterday. The people who gave you George W. Bush in the election. That police may set up roadblocks to collect tips about crimes, rejecting concerns that misplaced might use the checkpoints to fish for unrelated suspicious activity. The 6 to 3 decision allows officers to block traffic and as motorists for help in solving crimes. Critics who complain that the thirties might misuse the power, disguising drag nets as informational checkpoint. In other words, maybe this is one of Friske. They would like, you know, do a little body cavity search. Let the dog and my family. Yeah, let the dog snip your back home parts, your private's. Roadblocks are used for a variety of investigations. The two thousand two police use them to try to produce leads in the Elizabeth's Mark kidnapping in Utah. And the sniper shootings in the Washington DC area, but the Supreme Court has limited their use. Although the justice is of a lot of random sobriety checkpoints to detect drunken driver. Like Diana Ross and what was his name? Peter Warrrell. Do you know that he got his license suspended five years here in it like didn't even make the newspaper? No. What a nice cover up they didn't. And then they just kind of like shipped him out of town. And I understand I want to tell you who told him I don't want to say. They ruled in 2000 that roadblocks intended for drugsturch searches are an unreasonable invasion of privacy out of the constitution. In two days decision just as Briar who makes a dandy ice cream said that the short stops of very few minutes of most are not too intrusive. Considering the value in crime solving, please may hand out flyers or restrivers of volunteer information. Ha ha ha ha ha. That oh man. Five minutes at most you car. You will cooperate man. Per car.

But, you know, one of those things. Sunny crock it, my mevice. Sunny crock it. Okay. No kidding. A baby crock it. I was like a cue on that. You can play it again though. No thanks. I don't think so. I crock it. I've already a cool skin cap. Like a baby crock it. Only a pastel. Tucker who's a regular fact. You're usually pretty perspicacious. You're really just a listen to carefully. I think I picked a winner. Jim Rockford from the Rockford front. Somebody beat you to it. Tucker. Good choice, I guess. I never was crazy about that show. In fact, I didn't like that show at all. Really? That's the only detail to show. No. Okay. But you probably also watched the catch of thief with Robert Wagner in the What's your name? A little bit. Man. Rockford falls was good. He was a sad sack. He was a little bit of trouble. Robert Wagner. Yeah. Robert Wagner man is another guy. He used to look all the way. Oh good. I was scary until he threw Natalie overboard. But he could be the worst actor. I mean, big name actor. Of anybody who was like really successful. He's so stiff. Right. He was in a movie that Kevin Bacon later played the role. He made the movie about where he throws the, he gets married. And he throws the girl off the top of the building. And then he goes after sister for the money. He merged with Kevin Bacon movie. That was a mat. Dylan movie. Like I said, Mat Dylan, the read the movie. What's the name of the movie? But the original was with Robert Wagner. Kiss before dying. Oh, I can't believe it. That is unbelievable. Don't ask me how long. That's shocking. That's almost like my, remember my, uh, frequent flyer Delta number. That is beyond belief. And the girl was Sean Young. Wow. Holy crap. Everybody squatting. Drop a big one. Wow. That was amazing. That's it. I'm done. A piss before I kiss before dying. That's very good. It was, uh, I'm trying to remember the, the woman rubber Wagner.

You know, easy lay a sitting around talking at, uh, at the lunch or dinner in a restaurant. You know what they're all talking about? I give up. Talkie. Oh, I'm serious. I'm not joking. Let's see. Kiss daddy goodbye. Kiss daddy good night. Kiss daddy's ass. The kiss. Uh, a kiss before dying. Gold digger Wagner kills one rich sister. Joanne Woodward. See, I mean, to compare Mad Dylan. Well, Robert, Robert, Robert Wagner's actually pretty good in this. But generally speaking, is acting performances were incredibly stiff. I mean, the day that they put him in a ground, you'll be hard pressed to see the difference between the before and after. I mean, a stiff by any other name would die the same. But boy, he sure looked good then. I think 56. That's 47 years ago. A lot of people looked before he's seven years ago. But could you do it? Right. Anyway, he kills one rich sister. Romances the other effective thriller, marked only by somewhat one performance from leaf. Whose leaf? Virginia leaf. Wagner's terrific though, from our relevance novel, we made 1991. So the remake, oh, here it is, lacklust your thriller run by the double casting of young. That's, uh, Sean Young. As wealthy twinces is romance by murderers dad, Dylan.

You need to go to block, but no, oh, sorry. Well, how do you, well, how do you, right over here? Like I said, Hollywood video, do not go to blockbuster because they used to suck Wayne's ass. Uh, go to an, and plus blockbuster is senses the videos in. Correct. Oh, it's easy. So go get your DVDs and your DVDs at the Hollywood video or some other place. Exorcist, right? Because there are people who haven't seen it. And on DVD, they've got the new one. Would they added scenes where she's falling down the backwards down the stairs? They do however need to put it in a different part of the story. They need to put it into the comedy section now. What's that? Exorcist. Why? Because that's what people do with it now is they look at it. But the piece soup and they lie about it. No. Yeah. That is why the panic. The one that's spinning around is not funny. He soup. No, it's not fun. Jesus. That's because you didn't see when the first came out. The panic, right? Exactly. No, it's not funny. Sure it is. You know something you're going to burn in hell.

The start-up company that's assembling radio stations in town for radio network to challenge conservative talk show powerhouses like Rush. But Frank and have been holding off at recent months. Probably if road is hot selling book lies and the lying liars who tell them. And probably because he had reservations about the previous owners of the venture. Things got more serious in terms of plenty of other stations and money to make this possible with a changing ownership he said. Last November the company was bought by an investment crew played by Mark Walsh, former AOL executive and advisor the Democratic National Committee from the venture capital has sheldon and needed drop me. And it goes on about he did this and this one did that in Yadiyani. Did that work even has to decide yet on name?

Come this one. Maybe want to give up. Americans like Bush's qualities. Paul said they like a liar. They like somebody goes. And wants it over the cheeseburgers are. Yet Democrats said they have it. They made domestic issues. In other words, the issues. Not on that terrorism. No, I'm a world of ants. They want to they like can they like the cowboy. They like the gunslinger. We're going to go and smoke them out of their holes. Baby, out of those spider holes. In fact, how about spider man? Okay. Two thirds of Americans think President Bush has the right personal qualities for the presidency. You nearly have her more than Democratic Party would do a better job at major domestic issues. According to another poll, we got polls up the ass man. God. A CNN USA today Gallup poll released yesterday interviewed a thousand plus at all Americans last week in on Bush. An nationalist who's ranging from environmental security. The poll indicated that Bush's favorable standing with most Americans on his personal qualities is a main reason for his job of providing a 59% of most recent poll and similar high-mars and other polls. Everybody loves a liar. The poll also showed that 55% of those interviewed agree with Bush on issues that matter to them. Oh my God. Is that the book? Holy crap. Bro. Who sent that? Bring that in here right away. Even freaky Carlos gets high marks for a Russian that right in. Somebody actually brought me a copy to book. I would have paid him for it. It's hard. And the book too. That's what Carlos said. He said he was squeezing it because it was hard. Who's this from? There must be there's a note inside. Uh, it's from... Green Van Day. Thank you, Green Van Day. You're the best man. He is the best. He's great. Who's Green Van Day? He's got a Green Van. No. And why? Why? Because they painted a green. Do you know who this is? Yeah. He stopped by and brought us things before. He's great. Here's the book. I'll bring you my own personal copy. In fact, this hour instead of with a stupid pull, I could read some excerpts from this. Real quick. Because you know me. This vivid unfolding narrative is like, no other book that's been written about the Bush presidency or any that's likely to be written soon. And it's core are the candid assessments of former history, uh, uh, treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill. For two years in administration, topic and I'm a official, uh, principal of the National Security Council and a tutor to the new president. He's the only member of Bush's innermost servant to leave. And I'm a new degree to speak frankly about what's really been happening outside the White House. O'Neill's account is supported by suscines interviews with many participants in the administration by transcriptive meetings by voluminous documents that cover most areas of domestic and foreign policy. The result is a disclosure of breath and depth on parallel for non-going presidency. As readers are taken to the very epicenter of government as newsmaking body, offers a definitive view of the characters in conduct of Bush and if closest advisors and they manage crucial domestic policies and global strategies and time of life and death crises.

Test by Danish and American experts indicate there is no chemical war for agents in murder shells on Earth last week. This part of this has chopped off in southern Iraq. But more testing is needed to confirm the findings the military reported today. Maybe they can stick some in there. The preliminary findings cast out with these suspicious shells will become the smoking gun, proving that Iraq still maintains a plies of banned chemical weapons when the US and the Allies launched the world of the war last March. The US led Iraq survey group conducted tests on five shells, none of them, count zero, zero, the big, oh, none of them showed traces even of chemical agents. The Danish Army said the statement released in beautiful Copenhagen. Based on the test, the experts conclude that none of the shells contained chemical war for agents in the test and in that more testing need for final confirmation, but don't hold your breath. It is believed the shells discovered last week by Danish troops there from the 1980-88 Iran Iraq War and right off the bat there were a hawken here.

That's a little point. I was listening to it. It just doesn't sound right. But the point is is that I just, um, even think, oh, clear channel didn't do this. And that just was basically. And I said, you know, this is the only show I like listening to. I every frankly, when every other radio show program comes out including Russell and I, I run the other direction. The only reason he's on the ear on cheap channels because he's a right wind self-hating faggot that's the only reason he's on there. Absolutely, man. I moved out here from California.

He's got a lot of rich and melonscared money behind him. He's a bang and that encoder blowup doll. He's got Bob Kunst, there whispering things into her ear. Fives into her ear. Five six seven, five six, the pound five, six, the on a AT&T and Verizon Marlese line. This we're building a gigantic, a magnificent list. Anyway, sure.

Number one, number two, or number three when I was a kid. That's that's why I went a little bit, you know, I got to that fork in the road. I figured out one and two, but number three always confuse me a little bit. Five six, seven, five, six, the pound five, six, the only eight. And you know something, you're your side tracking me with all this crap. I got the book, the price of loyalty by Ron Susskind would the picture a him in Paul O'Neill on the front jacket? Don't I, sorry, it's not a picture. Him is a picture of George W. Boy, excuse me, Ron, I apologize. A picture of W. And Paul O'Neill. On your list, maybe Howard and you and Jeff Rimmer. PR Rouse says which by the way, Topo Gigiil was not a character. He was a guest and act on the Sullivan show, just like senior win, win, winchy, that night. Yeah. It says maybe you are Howard and Jeff Rimmer and the can out get together for dinner and golf. No, I'll leave it up to them. We'll let them fight over picking up the check. Or can you imagine the long stare down on that deal? Just stare in each other. When I eat, no, you pick it up. Now when you go ahead, you go ahead. No, how about you? A meal from which nobody would ever leave. Talk about the last supper. Should I just read like a thing? Sure, yes, open it. Read. And I can't do that. We won't make any sense. I don't want to do that again. Like I got sucked into that Al Franken book that day. That guy, I hope that guy hit like a hang me. Or something like a bad himroid. That chapter. Oh, yeah. I mean, I picked out a couple of my own that I had read up front. Oh, no, you got to read the one about whatever it was. I didn't even come. Who was it? Oh, yeah, sure. See these people that are obsessed with God damn Fox. We don't watch Fox on this show. Okay, Fox can drop dead. Then was your report murdered out together. So all these pieces, that's childish. That's why nobody wants to listen to that so-called old-fashioned talk radio because it's like a bunch of over-road children is what it is. Oh, it's the right against the left and the left against the right and you're all right. Now I'm all wrong and it's Sean Hannity said this and the bill around he said that and you know, and I had to craft. Man, oh, man, it's for old people. I want to play in a sandbox and I hope that somebody changes their depends like Ednon passions, at least she's a panic. Bring her back, baby. We need a lot more misses wallas where that passions has go right in the old crap. I'm not far ready with Julian and Eve and Eve and Eve and Julian and T.C. and Whitney and Whitney and Chad. Florida, we had the hang and Chad on passions. They got the Schwarzer Chad which by the way, do something about that spaghetti haircut you got. 27 past one. See your smurking beauty if you saw, you said, what is that? What is that? So, Puppar? You know how they had that black squid pasta, have you ever seen that? Yeah, that's what his hair looks like now. He went away for a little while. They brought him back and he got like a whole bunch of squid our nesting on his head. Like that must-read on mode. Oh, sorry, Mo. Oh, speaking that, what a segue. Look at that, that's because I was holding the copy. I was holding it in my hand and squeezing it. And it was making yelpings sounds. Hey, all you guys out there, Mo isn't the only one. If your hair is like a gone, down the tubes, down the toilet, down the drain. Here's the answer for you, Chuck Alphiari. I've been talking about Charles Alphiari for years now. I would say nearly a third of me. Long time. And that's because all of those years he's been helping guys look their best with his natural hairline system which he keeps improving. He's got the best technology going and the difference is it looks like real hair like it's going out of your scalp as opposed to the muskwet that don't on mode's head. Or the one that's dry and then probably look what it's doing to poor Dennis Cassinage. He can't break a one share. He's great. He says all the right things.

I called this meeting because I care deeply for you. And as you probably know, I have a great deal of respect for you as a sports broad guy. With that continuing bump, but what gifts? All right, hold here. Here's a check for you. What's that for? It's to buy out the remainder of your contract. I'm afraid we can all agree with you in the morning. Thank you. What are you mean? What do you fire at me? Well, let me put it this way. You remember that grand piano you had Gellie drop on my head? Yeah, that was a panic. Well, that woke me up to the realization that I actually run a radio station. Now, if you were to be so kind to hand in the keys to your Compt Car and remove all your Compt Clothes, my lovely receptionist Carlos here will show you the door. We just a minute. Or else, what? Have you taken a good look at Carlos? Ah, all right. Oh, Carlos. Yes, Mr. E. Lisho, Mo, the door. This here's the door, honey. You don't show it to him. For now. Let's go, Mr. Watch the peg. Watch the peg. Oh, I got no good dirty. That night, the fire at a red smoke, how would it be? It's a waste facility or the gris deo aids. Stop it, baby. Oh, we know you can eat dinner dinner. And I can walk and make it the boat. I'll never go back in the next gig out of my room. I don't know but he loved me. I don't think respect me. But that, in why am I naked? Hold on my balls and a bit with his screen. Good luck, Kimo. And like I said, left out over to an L. Let's take a nice and slow. 132 at 5.60 W. W.M. I don't know. Somebody facts me this thing. Home delivered fresh cookies, a phone call, where are these people looking for a plug? Is that what I don't know? I don't get this. Article in the a herald, I guess. About home, home delivered fresh cookies. Do we want to plug these people? No, no. Unless you get some. And then it says, what about Luke Halburn? Help him. How? Luke Halburn? Who played sand? You can put sandy and then in parentheses. Ripper. Sandy Rick. Well, we don't need his last name. Oh, it's picking a Rick. I better not say it because he's been so nice to me. And I like him. He's a good guy. You know who I saw yesterday on channel six, which I almost never watched their news. But since I've been home, I'm watching him. Because I don't want to see the all-right rigors news. He was doing a promo for something. Well, I'll give you a clue. And then you see if you know who it is. Just let me give you a hint. Just a second. We're going to, oh, we got all that Rick Riley stuff. Damn it. Hey, Rick Riley, get lost. Oh, Rick, Sean. Uh, it's a lie. I am not, I'm not saying. Okay, I'm guess. Rick Sean? Yeah. Well, I wasn't going to waste all of that effort for Christ's sake. Jesus. Now, Rick, please. I don't, I never really paid that much attention to whether he was like, Chubby. I guess he was a little on the Chubby side. But Rick, you're like, pork it up, baby. Like all the rest of us. Don't do it, man. You're a good guy. You've been on either her 40 years. I've been on the ear. But third man. Being just badly. Everybody, everybody, that's all we talk about is uh, this one's fat and that one's fat and everybody just keep getting fat and fat and fat and fat. It's uh, it's a disease. Bro, test. I got so much stuff here. Man, oh, man, are we going to have time? I got the book to read. I should read the whole book on the ear. Okay. That is not a well about a 0.00. Oh, first we had the bad news about the weapons and master's destruction which turned out to be empty. The mortar shells. Well, guess what? Who's saying more in your rackets to be where outside fighters document says? Remember all that crap about the ties between Al Qaeda and the Sodom who's saying? Oh, no, no, don't tell us that the president lied to us. That's one of those personal qualities that Americans admire about him is either a chronic liar like Greg Reed. Sodom who's saying more in his rackets and porters to be wary of joining forces with foreign Arab fighters ending your uh, entering your rack to battle American troops. According to a document found with the former Raki leader when he was captured, Bush administration officials said yesterday, the document appears to be a directive written after he lost power from Mr. Hussein to leaders of the Iraqi resistance counseling caution against getting too close to Islamic jihadist and other foreign Arabs coming into occupied Iraq. It provides a second piece of evidence challenging the Bush administration's contention of post cooperation between Mr. Hussein's government and terrorist from Al Qaeda. CIA interrogators have already elicited from top Al Qaeda officials and custody that before the American letter of Asian, Osala bin Laden had rejected and treaties from some of his latinans to work jointly with Mr. Hussein. Official said Mr. Hussein apparently believed that the foreign Arab zigger for a holy war against the West had a different agenda from the bautist who were eager for the wrong return to power and bagged that. As a result he wanted his supporters to be careful about becoming close allies with the jihadist officials from any of the documents said. What are you going to the law? Another lie from day one had we all mentioned. That's what we've always done. That's what everybody knew if they had a brain. And even though it's right there in black and white and pink. Now this mark was one of our really great factions lately and I was hesitant, but I mean lately has been full of stuff. Wait to hear this. This is a very perspicacious on a better acute that thing up again. A better cue up. I can't find it. Anyway, he's got a whole observation on why people though are Anderson network now. I'm a man. I don't think it's a low-hoo. He says both human George mentioned how difficult is to get people to appreciate the movie network. I think network is great, but it suffers from one problem. Patty Tri-F ski was too prescient. Too many things that he foresaw then and used for wild satair are commonplace now. Right. The satair's completely lost on audiences either too young or too stupid to remember things haven't always been the way they are now. Excellent point. Like people who watch the work Sanchezio, both of them. It starts with the very first scene in the movie which shows four TV screens in which each of the network news anchors in the mid 70s. Howard Cacema TVC John Chancellor NBC Walter Crunkite CBS and Howard V. L. UBS, who used to say, The point was to show that Bill was part of this distinguished fraternity the men who brought us the news, dignified, respectable and dependable. What happens as Bill unravels is made more startling than I would read just from the starting point. Now, of course, it is this viewpoint of the news that's unraveled. We have Fox News, the history among the MSNBCC and Ends, there's no longer any small dignified group of wise men who bring us the news, Edward Armer, or Huntley and Brickly, etc. are literally unimaginable today. And as you mentioned yesterday, most young people get their news from alternate sources. Anyway, thank God. Thank you. Good. The tabloidization of the news which we take for granted today was another thing that was presented as sat there. The same thing goes for the reality programming. That's what Diana Christensen wanted. I'll get back to you, Diana. She would have been perfectly at home with fear factor and 76, however reality programming was pure fiction thought up by Tiaiske. Even the sub themes suffer the same fate. The danger of a huge non-media conglomerate, CCA owning a network of managing the news, is today's media consolidation in Karnit. And the Saudis using their money influence over a network, held a only F and White House, the Fugun White House. And he says the same fate has been fallen in another excellent movie written by Tiaiske, the hospital, which was the darkest sat there ever since during Turchy Scott. If you haven't seen it recently, check it out. See it at many times. It's great. It is great. It's great. It's a small one for somebody who despises the medical professionals as much as I do, who knows that all the performing to wrong operation, somebody goes in for a... His rectamy. I just direct him and they chop off a leg. You know what I mean? Like that. As an example. Somebody goes in to have a hemorrhidectomy and they like chop off two arms. If you haven't seen it recently, check it out, which we have, but you people should see it. Host the hospital. When Scott starts to rant how doctors are entering into businessmen as opposed to physicians, you can only recall fondly how medicine used to be practiced in this country. Sorry for the rances, Mark, but I love freaking that work. And... Thanks, Mark. God, these facts are just pouring in. And then there's MOD. Somebody actually like MOD? I like Adrian's Barbose. Yeah, but she did. I like it. I like it. I like her. But Zumbus too. And anyway, we could put MOD on there. I can't believe anybody actually liked that. But she was nasty. She was hard to take. She was like the four-runner of the, like a younger nanny. You know what I mean? The nanny. Boy. In fact, if you watch the nanny and I'm surprised they don't bring it back, put it on Fox News. A Fox entertainment. Because if you watch enough, you'll start believing that the Bush people have a point. 21 till 2 at 5.60 WQAM. Want to talk about a good friend's Armstrong's Toyota of Homestead.

You know, we once did that thing. I know we did it before and I'm tempted to do it again. Hello, you know, we can encourage, although sometimes it's a bad mistake. People to see movies that you would suggest that you think most people haven't seen. You know, obscure movies like Gone with the Wind. See, the problem with that is that what's obscured to them. What about that? Now work would be okay. Because it's 28 years old. See, I'm talking about older movies. Right. In fact, if we if we were to it right, it would make a difference. No, it might. No. No, it's seriously because for the younger people the punks out there, they're the whippersnappers who think that, you know, you know, it's got to have like, like you said before, it's got to have like a action killer, all this girl. Yeah, well, personal first. If it don't have personal things and the hell with it, lasers, like pre pick a year, like pre 85 movies, pre 80. Okay. Our pre 80 movie that you think most people haven't should see. Regardless of what you think. If you say that what you, that's that's just doesn't matter what you create. You can look. Think it's something like that. See, it'll look like the old S.H. factory again. Stupid. Yeah. But I think that's a possibility. And I'm not doing it just a killer pool, but, but, no, seriously, I think that we can, now that you, it didn't used to be the way it is now. I mean, used to be when everything was on VHS. You go into your video story. And it was like, you are fairly small selection. Now, not only with the tape, but also now with DVDs, just about any movie that's ever been invented that more than five people watch it. It's there or if you can't find it in your store, you would Amazon.com, which I can't tell you how much I love and I love them. They are the greatest. They, uh, they should be a billion dollars in stock because I would promote them from now to the end of time. Free shipping, the stuff is there. They give you a track a number. She's a problem. It shows up like exactly when I tell you. Don't hit him for another website of the other guy. Right. Right. What is not to like on Amazon fricking.com? I love it. So what I'm starting to say is if you can't find it in your story, just go on there and say, you waited a couple of days. And about a big mirror, it is different books too. You might see it in cities, evil books like that one. That is correct. Just like that book about the cat with church, right? And find out my book, stir, I got it. Amazon.com. 560, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50. 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. QAM. Go ahead. I have to be Archie Bunker. Okay. Thanks a lot, Charlie. Archie Bunker has got 56 votes.

But like I always said, he'll like to show. See you. I just refused to do that. This business is sucking up to people. You know, just like that right when you smuck before, that's trying to, you know, I mean, the whole thing is phony anyway. Phony is an 85 dollar bill. And well, you know, if you don't do the show this way, I've listened. What do I care about one schmuck with a fax machine? What do I give a crap if you listen more and now? We got plenty of other fish in the sea out there who enjoy the show. We don't have it in your complaints. Who don't, if they wanted to hear Rush Limbao Jr., they turned on Frick and Rush Limbao. Senior. Exactly. They check out Limbao Rock Jr. and Limbao Rock Senior. And they can, they can listen to a, uh, snit. Yeah, they can listen to the schmuck. And then they can also listen to Bill O'Ranik, as nobody else does. You know, his radio ratings is bad as they are here, which there's, there's, there's in minus infinity. In New York, you don't do nothing either. There's nothing. Good. Yeah. There's hell. So the only reason he has any audiences because of the fox news thing, the sick offense, the right wing assels, whose entire lives are so much of it. They're the same as the people who watch the 700 Club. The same thing. Mm-hmm. Without as much, uh, lower a garden Jesus. Or he slips it in. And without as much snoring and drooling.

If you didn't, I think you were thinking of calbs. But it wasn't a Diner. It says calbs had a great bakery inside. It's now called Joe's. Remember the golf gas station in the corner of Oak Park, but we're an Andrew. Oh yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha. Not really. We don't have no golf no more do we? That's what I've seen. That's what I've seen.
