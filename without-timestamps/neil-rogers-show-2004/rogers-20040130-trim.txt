The birthday of your castle. It's Friday, you best in space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Overpressed. It's highly expensive mission. They put a man on Mars. The Seekout Little Green Man. To boldly spend more than anyone has ever spent the fall. I love that music. You think we should spend lots of money. We don't have to send a man where humans were never supposed to be. How do you mean? You loved you? You can get them. You need to loosen up their missions, but I have no emotion in this. Kind of like a fellow rum spell. Well, never mind. It's got to take something Mars at warp speed. I got it, too. It comes up. We need more things. Oh, darn. Well, maybe Dr. McCoy has the answer. The paybones? It can't you find me some funny money for this here. Mars mission. Family George. I'm a doctor. I don't have any Rona countenance. Well, some of the one thing to do with them. Set pagers on deficit. Can't owe two at five sixty. WCM Hulled is Joel Acustello today. Do we know? I don't know. Maybe. Seriously. 31. There's two. 33. 29. 34. And why happy birthday, Joey Zokar and our book. He's probably still sleeping right now. I don't want to see him. Why don't you take it a negative way. You'll say something negative way. I'm talking about something on his face. It looks like Howard Dean's chin. Do you know what I mean? Huh? He knows. No, no, I'm not bad. Yeah, his nose looks like Howard Dean's chin. Anyone? Sorry I said that. A thousand and twenty three votes on yesterday's pool. We got heavy duty stuff today. We got two polls, of course. What do these statements do you think you do most strongly. We asked yesterday. Is most true, whatever. None of the above the show is fine. 432.2 percent. That's a pretty good endorsement. I would say. We'll take it. We'll take anything we can get. That's good. I'm impressed. WQM needs for our back. Bad. 177.3 percent. Is he coming back? No. So it's a mode point. You just keep waiting. Now what was the story with Joe Rose this morning? Was he just out of his sign or something? Is getting recruited possibly. He wants to hold his hand. He wants to hold his hand. He wants to hold his hand. He wants to hold his hand. He wants to hold his hand. He wants to hold his hand. He wants to hold his hand. Man. Like I said, take the money to the bank boys. Okay. It's outstanding. Work whatever it had you feel like it. All these guys. All these big macho guys had a turn to me to be their leader. George is a hard ass spick as next in our poll 118.11.4 percent. You moved up nicely. It was strong third play showing. That voted when I got home. Clarence's gay 65 and not only that, but highly underqualified for the position and the chair sitting in. You're not a bad guy, Clarence. You're not great, but get out. Get lost. He's got 65. WQM has a death wish 64 and I think Clarence's part of it. Too much bush on is show the wrong kind 64. We'll make up with that for our second poll later on. Not the bush. Right? Remedy. While we're trying to make up for lost time. Great read belongs on death row. 63 and blow would I be delighted to pull that switch. And last and very least. Neal is too angry. 41, only 3.9 percent. So you're on provocative to go about there. Try to steer that curve. Oh, yeah, everybody we talked to. They don't want to hear you anymore. You used to be a lot of fun, but now you two angry. You two angry. The most shittled cripples is what we're talking about. Plus it's a little spick cluster of fork that you know sit around having a circle jerk during the show. The five. One of them was the one that caught yesterday about Michael Moore and I like that. And he was one of them. But I just let him go. See, unlike you, I don't get all bad other. Shape this one and go. It's very entertaining. It gets you all worked up. Yeah, I got that. Oh, speaking of that. So I watched the entire hour and a half debate last night and it ended just like Fargo. They wrapped it up real quick and sudden and like, what just happened? You know, like that's the end? Just happened. It was okay. But like I said, and even the pundits, even the talking had pundits in the aftermath, which they kill a lot of time with that. They agreed with me. And so did you. I'll shrugged in and Dennis Cassini's were far and away. I mean, heads and shoulders above the others in terms of their answers in terms of their a command of the issues in terms of having with big balls. And the other guys were like, okay, separately, women who are pathetic. Who continue like you're Republican? Who continues to be Republican and drag and nobody takes them serious. But it's interesting that two guys who do the best, they have the lowest numbers and all the polls. And, um, sharp and coincidence. That amazing. Well, it's just that nobody gives and nobody takes them seriously. They enjoy it's like entertainment. We like hearing the fact that they got a big mouth, but we know they haven't got any chance so why should we waste their vote on them. Oh, the last of the flammers coming today, you're going to love it. You'll be able to smell it. But here's the amazing news from MSNBC this morning. The polls. Uh, before we get to that, pull number one. Let's get that up there for the first couple of hours. And then we'll build the other one all during the show. Just for fun. Now the reason I'm doing this is because I saw him the last couple of days that I've been showing clips of Bubba. And every time I see him, I think to myself, all please, please. Can't we just change that, uh, can't we have another constitutional amendment? So that president can serve three terms four or five six. Please. And when I think of all of that craft at the right wingers drag this country through. Kenny Star and all these other Nazi bastards. I said also all these for Abyss and Aguiam who were trying to nail his ass from the day that he won the election fair in square 92. He is gay, all his garbage. Well, how come they got it? It's been more time on fighting terrorism because of a too busy fight in a bunch of right wing lunatics about a stay-not-a-blue dress. That was a big part of it. And anyway. So I haven't seen him and he spoke to the Senate leaders the other day and they came out with a big smile on their post. They liked what they heard. Just for fun. If Bill Clinton could run again in the elections today, who do you vote for? Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, neither or I wouldn't vote regardless. We always have that hard ass crowd. We're not going to get me to vote. It's crap. And they're bunch of crap. You know, they're the angry ones. Maybe they're just not angry enough. See if we live in a country where the people really had any brains at all collectively. I'll start to get a little bit smarter. That's pretty obvious now. They're getting pissed off. Even the American public are only, they're only like mellow for so long and finally, they start getting pissed off and fired off. Like when they have no job, things like that. A little like when too many innocent people start dying all over the place. When they discover they've been ahead. But the thing about this trying to make a deadline for the 9-11 investigation based purely on political grounds. And then John McCain, who everybody always touts in spite of that big cancer, is thinking of Jake. John McCain says, well, I have a solution for that. How about not releasing the report to like January 2005? But what kind of crap is that? So in other words, if they find a bunch of really damning evidence, let's just go ahead and have the election again. And then you'll find out afterward, you're elected a liar and a thief and a crook again. You can't tell us that before the election. Ha ha ha ha. Why can't they just do it until they're actually finished with their work? What a concept? And whatever the information about why 9-11 happened in the negligence and who is responsible? And who is feeding a supply-acrap? Then the American public can find out. What a concept, huh? Wow. But like I said, if the public really was filming at the mouth about that, I noticed it. Dennis Cassinius was the one that brought up the project for Newmark and sent you a last night. It had the balls to say that they had decided ahead of time. That they were going to invade Iraq that was already there. And they were just waiting for some excuse, which they found. Like 3,000 dead people in New York and Washington, etc. So anyway, there's the poll. The first one. If Bill Clinton could run again a third time against the Bush today. And the elections right now. Who do you vote for? Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, neither. I wouldn't vote regardless. Let's see how Bubba does compared to like Kerry and Dean did the last couple of times. What do you say? You say those? Do I say them? I don't need to say them. I kind of committed a memory. I committed. Dean at about 67% of Bush 18 and Kerry had 72.5% of Bush 18 got it. Got it. Keep in mind. What? Now, speaking numbers, let's throw a lot of numbers out there. What do you say? That's one, I mean. Well, that's part of the sports thing, you know. 2268-48-49. That's 69 hike. That kind of crap. I love when the players come out and they like clap their hands when they come out of the huddle or the best is like when they're holding hands. Such a faggy thing. Anyway, go patriots. That's what I have to talk to you. I like to hold hands with Tom Brady for a while. With the total 269 delegates to be selected next Tuesday, seven states. What are they again? Let's see. North Dakota. Delaware, South Carolina. On, I should want to apologize for both of us. I keep making this mistake. He was born there, I guess in South Carolina. But the John Edwards is a senator from North Carolina. You should know that being a North Carolina mean yourself. Yeah. But we keep saying he's from South Carolina in his home state. It's pretty damn close. You know, right down here, Hirshi Harweg. We apologize. At any rate, I think it was pretty bland last night. They said he blew it. It was his big chance he really desperately needs to win South Carolina. And right now, the zombie pole says he's in a statistical tie with Kerry. Every 25, 24 percent and the full effect of Kerry's endorsement by Black representative James Clayburn. The state's most influential Black leaders yet to be felt it says. So they're like dead heat and South Carolina so far. In the other states in Missouri, this is shocking. This is the latest zombie pole. Missouri carries about 45 percent. At John Edwards 11 percent. Nobody's even close and Dean's got nine in Missouri. Ready for that? Oh, wow. And Arizona, Kerry's got 38 percent, Wesley Clark 17 and Howard Dean 12. For a cent. Archie's number is staggering. If you only place where Kerry's not leading or in the time for Lee, like South Carolina is Oklahoma, where Clark leads all his rivals with 27 percent followed by Kerry at 19 percent, Edward Sturred at 17 percent. So it looks like Kerry, if he wins a couple of these or maybe three of them, especially Missouri. And especially South Carolina, can you imagine that because the rap has been all, he can't win on a South and he's a liberal, New England piece of crap Kennedy liberal all the sort of bull crap. People are tired of cliches. They're interested in that. Just tell us what you think what you're going to do. And we don't really give a crap out all cliches. You know, it just like all the other, the right wingers last night. Well, you know, what's that gay marriage thing comes up? That's going to really turn off them people on the South. People have more important things to worry about. The people are concerned about that are going to vote for Bush anyway. Right. The right wing fundamentalist assholes, but there are noes is up everybody's up. But those people are going to vote for the Bush-Mister anyhow. So that's really kind of a mood point. It's a red hearing. If I can say that. Well, here's our daily death report. Thank you again. Scott Patterson. Who? Northern Ontario Curler who began the first man from North Bay, Ontario, to skip two men's teams to the Breyer Canadian Curling Championship. How do you like that? I'll be back in the second half. After the Bany was driving, we'll start by another vehicle. He was only 34 years old. Wow, sorry. It was one of the great curlers along with that late Sandbrush Schmurler. The great Canadian Curler.

Oh, it's bound to happen. Hey there people on Bob and Brown. Rosemary's the mother of the late musician Frank Zappa died yesterday. She was 91. Oh, that's old enough. Ma. I didn't say that you said that. Ma. The few died at a Burbank convalescent hospital said daughter Patrice Zappa. Zappa was born in the US. Did out of Italian immigrants. She and her husband married in Baltimore, 1939 and moved to San Diego 15 years later. Frank Zappa who started out with the 1960s. Group the mothers of invention recorded dozens of solar albums. A tillers death from prostate cancer and cancer in 1993 at the age of only 52. Jesus. How come she couldn't have died in 52. He could have stayed alive. You know what? Can you imagine all good stuff we'd have to play? Hey there people on Bob. It's the reason why I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. He tells me that your sister has a blister. But that's beside the point. All of a speaking of sisters with a blister. Here's a bad story from Bridgeport Connecticut. Boy the stuff is coming. If I could tell you what piles I got here, it's unbelievable. Although we do want to get in some really good calls like this one. I'm lying six. WQAM. Hello. Yeah. What I'm going to talk to Neil. Speaking. Neil Rogers. Yes, I am. Oh, okay. I want to get in on a pole that can have last week. Okay. That I miss. Couldn't get in. Okay. TV radio personalities to the blood. Jennifer Rimm. Jennifer Rimm. How could we forget all Jennifer. My God. We apologize to her. Anybody have a heart? Or a heart? Exactly. We're only doing TV personality. Oh that's right. Well she was on TV for a heart. Yeah. Yeah. I remember the night that she came on the news and said, I'm so happy. Thank you, baby. Yeah. She's a sweetheart. We love Jennifer. Okay. I just wanted to hear the her name got on the pole even though I'm about a week late. I'm delighted that she did. Man, it was a bad oversight and we apologize. Thanks, Palerati. Thank you. See, I told you that was a good call. I could feel it. I could smell it. Can't you smell it? I had a great story to tell about Jennifer. Little later on. Yeah. After the show. Okay. Now, remember what I told you about, I and Z. How she used to bring her boyfriend's. Well, they used to come calling for her. You know, work? Yes. Man, she had really good taste. That's all I can tell you. I don't want to impellish it because all those homophobes go. She here he goes again. Well, you know, it's I candy man. That's what George says. And everybody else and I'm tired of hearing it. No, I don't know. What? I'm starting to think I like that expression again. It's just got a little bit older for a while. Let's bring it back. Go ahead. You can have it. I-I-I-I candy. Oh, seriously. Because one of those guys would show up. I'd go to the door and I'd look and say, I'm just going to do that. Candy. Yeah. Yeah. And the best part of the whole deal was when Jennifer would see who it was at the door. Yeah. You know what she always said? Wanna lolly pop little boy? See it was more than just eye candy. Maybe it was fly candy. There you go. Or fly paper. Can I get to the store please? I'm a little bit too angry and pissed off today. Actually, I'm delighted to do that. I don't know what is I'm getting rid of all that flindle. I saw much better. You do? You're so good. I'll tell you. No matter what you do, a cold, general last. Unless it's a real, real mild one. And this is the first more serious cold I've had. I don't know a couple of years, I think. But a cold last like a week to two weeks. 10 days to two weeks. Correct. Am I right? You are correct, sir. And I got like a little flammler, but I'm doing much better. And of course, that pisses off a lot of people. They're waiting for me to be on that death list. Well, just to be a prick, I'm going to stay around to at least 90. Now, I'm thinking 87. Did you ever, no, you're not psychic like I am. No, mildly psychic. No, no, I really am very psychic. And for a couple of years now, I've had this thing that, it's like a little subliminal message in my head that tells me that I'm going to make it to 87. What are you better hurry then? She had made it to 90. But the diabetes, I think, will catch up to me because I did have another part of Ben and Jerry's coffee coffee crunch yesterday. Oh, it's the best one. It's so good. Did you ever still haven't had it right? No, they have these, I know that's funny that you should say that. I bought these Hershey's, you know, the little nuggets that come in the bag. Yeah. They have almond, Tom. No, most nuggets do come in a sack. Almond, Tom, he. Her, chunks. That's my weakness, man. With phenomenal almond, Tom. He just like that. Rogers almond brittle. Oh, God, I just. I spazzed out. I just me, like that. Two kinds of crud. So far beyond even the wildest section history, man. I'll tell you, that's stuff from my ethylene's in Vegas. Yeah. That almond coffee cruncher whatever it is. I could eat the whole box. It's very sad. And anyway, Bridgeport Connecticut, a Norwalkman. Can we take a quick first look at this poll because it's pretty interesting, I think. 124 votes in an, and no time. Ha ha ha. I'm telling you, man, you can smell it. You can feel it. You're going to see. And of course, now they. Neocons are pinging their pants, which is why they got the army saying, oh, we're going to get Osama this year. Well, how do they know that? Chris, they're positive. They're going to catch in this year. And if not, they'll dress somebody up like I said yesterday, who looks like it. In addition, which we've already heard is it in times that Osama's told his kid that if he's in danger of being captured, blow his brains out. He will not be captured alive. I'm like, Osama, he won't be in Osfighterhold. So they can like, they can come up with any tall person, you know? And say, hey, look at this. It's Osama. They can put on a phony beard. Sure. And it's Osama. And then, of course, when a real one shows up, they'll say, oops, we made another mistake, but we met. Well, you know, was it just a. Fruppy intelligence again. The growing danger. Yeah, with George Tenet's problem. See, Tenet keep in mind, is it a holdover from a Clinton days? He was the head of the C.I. during Clinton. He's the only one who was like a holdover to this fascist, I mean, this group. And so he's an easy skicko. So I don't know why anybody surprised that they're laying the blame on his shoulders. They were doing that months ago when he started with this crap a lot. Well, you know, we got some bad information about that. You're laying in Nigeria and that was all bogus. And about that meeting there in Germany that never took place with Muhammad Ata and all of these things, you know. And then the real irony of it is now. Now they find out Al Qaeda's been sneaking across from Iran and Al Qaeda, which was no threat in Iraq before, is now there up to their ass. And that amazing. So Iraq was really one of our least worries before. And now it's our primary worry along with Afghanistan with several more American kids died yesterday. I just mentioned that in passing. I see. 135 votes. Just for fun, if Bill Clinton could run again, good old Bubba, whether without the blue dress stains, baby. That's one of the reasons I think we liked them. Who do you want to present? Who's a stuffed shirt? We like a present and wants to give the action, right? But a fun like the Kennedy's. I quite that much fun though. If Bill Clinton could run again in the elections today, who do you vote for? 135 votes. Bubba 109 80.7 percent. Oh God. George's W.20. 14.8 percent. Did you say 14? I just have worked it. Wow. So amazed. You know, I'm astonished. Right. Neither one five. And I wouldn't vote regardless one. So it goes to show it that the crowd would stay away. See, Bubba would motivate them. That's one thing that excites them. Dean did excite them for a while. So they realized that he was not that great. And then carry excite them for the fact that he can still speak. Because he looks like a dead man. He looks like her in Munster. But I like carry. Did I tell you that a long time ago? Yes. I said that every day to try to say that I tell you that? No. I get to this horrible seminary in charge of the most in Girl's Story. But it's 1027 at 5.60 QA in your Heathen Station. I'm here. Sports for that. We might be squirming away. Yeah.

Oh, little bit of Monica. And my dog. A little bit of Monica. Without my wife. Now live in a Monica. What I see. When she's far away. That's no way. A little bit of Monica. What I need. A little bit of Monica. That more. A little bit of Monica. Here I am. A little bit of you. I'm a happy man. I take him up here. They missed him. Family. Bubbers. Better. About 8% of the mode. 178 votes. If you could. One again. Bubba 142. Just under 80%. Gw2715.1%. Need a one of the seven. I wouldn't vote it all too. See the difference. See that vast difference. Maybe he could go away and come back as a different person. There you go. Facial augmentation. Change it in the name. Mm-hmm. Maybe straighten out that penis a little bit. Bridgeport Connecticut. A Norwalk man who was studying to be a priest in the Roman Catholic Diasis. He was trying to straighten out his penis. Has been charged with sexually assaulting a 16 year old girl. A girl. Yeah. Canovel. That was her name. That's a good name. Leah. Leonardo Montoya 30. How old was he? About 30 man. Turned himself into Bridgeport Police Tuesday. And after learning that there was a warrant for his arrest he would charge with fourth and reach sexual assault and posted a $10,000 bond. Pisces officials said Montoya was dismissed from the Diasis in 7-A-N-Program January 15. After police told church officials about their investigation according to Connecticut post. It was in a third year of a four-year program leading to ordination as a priest. Joseph McAtear, McAlear, whatever hell his name was, a spokesman for the Diasis, said Montoya entered St. John Fisher's seminary residence in St. St. Stanford, September 2000, and Yadiyadiyadiyadiyadiyadiyo. These other ones. Mr. Montoya's denied the charges made against him. They McAlear said he was dismissed from the Diasis in seminary and program for showing poor judgment for allowing himself to be placed in an inappropriate situation in which those charges could be made. Police said Montoya molested the daughter of an acquaintance member 30. What date? About 30 man. While visiting the family's home in Bridgeport. Oh, how do you like that? So there you go. Another alleged police purvert. Doing innocent bystanders. And this time a woman no less. Hmm. Okay, let's see what we got to got to. You could do that. I'll stop. Are they your pardon? It was a woman. Let me just give you a hint. What the second pole is going to be a known, but put it up at noon. But we can start putting it up on your thinking caps. Okay? Just grab a hold of yourself and put on your thinking cap. What's your ultimate lesbian fantasy? I'm actually a lesbian. Two famous females. And the reason I put famous is, you know, we can't have like Brittany's spares in my wife. And I was like that. Like George would say. No. Huh? What's your- Ha ha ha ha. Because we said what's your ultimate lesbian fantasy. So like I said, like George wouldn't say. Two famous females. I started out with Brittany's spares in a Charlize Storon. Myself. Now what did you add to that? Charlize Theron and Jessica Beale. Yeah. And Howard Beale? Yeah. So that's what we'll put up at noon. And you can put on your thinking caps and think about it. Okay? Your ultimate lesbian fantasy. Because lesbian is a friend. I figured we got to do a lot more lesbian talk on and show for a kind of one back. The audience. I was just saying. A lot more dice. Or speaking of perversion. Michael Jackson encouraged the boy who later accused of a molestation into a pregnant British documentary with a suggestion of a movie career, a former lawyer for the boys family tells ABC News prime time. Jackson brought the boy to his neverland ranch and gave him some inducements about things that might happen if he did a good job on camera like he might have a movie career with him Dickerman. Told prime time Cynthia Fatmick Fadden. The interview took place before a judge issued a gag order in the case earlier this month. In the documentary Jackson has seen holding hands with a 12 year old who also rest his head on Jackson's shoulder. Put your head on my shoulder. What's spread my ear? Oh God. The boy tells the interview here and his brother had spent a night in the singer's bedroom and Jackson says he slept on the floor. Right. Dickerman and others told prime time that at the time that documentary was shot, according to the boy, both Jackson and the boy were telling the truth there would never been anything sexual in their relationship. Right. But according to a source from any of the boys allegations, the boys said that after the cameras were turned off later that same day, Jackson showed him pictures of naked women and cuddled him. The boy told no one. Dickerman said the boy who was befriended by Jackson when the answer was critically ill with cancer was brought to never land expressly to do the interview he hadn't been there for for months. A supposed he was trying to clean up his image put a young boy in front of the camera was says, yeah everything is okay he doesn't sleep with me there's nothing toward happening in bed he said. When a program aired last February the boys mother contacted and Dickerman said not because she had a suspicion about child molestation but because she felt the documentaries producers hadn't treated her son fairly. He had been on camera there had been no consent given said Dickerman and when she found out she was absolutely live it and said she would never give in her consent. Jackson disappeared from the boys life for five months after the interviewer source says the source does he disappeared he reappeared just before the British documentary was said to wear on ABC and at a storm of controversy Dickerman said the family told him that Jackson asked the 13 year old boy to fly with his family to an exclusive resort in Miami. Dickerman said Jackson told the boy they would hold a joint press conference there denouncing the documentary who was going to smoke it. He wanted to take the kid mom and the mom said no were all going he wanted to take just the kid the mom said ah ah we're all going which apparently wasn't a big hit with Michael who reportedly has no use for moms and for kids sisters said different don't want them bitches around. They get in the way. At the mother's insistence Dickerman said she and the boys brothers and sister arrived at turnberry in Miami but there was no press conference sources sold prime time that Jackson then flew the boy and his family back to Delhi in a private jet. After the documentary aired Jackson heard the family to abandon their modest department and working class East LA he convinced the family given the upper around the documentary that for their own safety they should leave their home and move in the Jackson's never land ranch and they said it on his valley. At the never land ranch the mother stayed apart from her children they were very closely monitored and closely guarded Dickerman said. We'll get to the Jesus do us we're getting to it. But it was sometime in February 2003 sources say that the boys has cuddling first gave way to win some sexual touching but he didn't speak of model station with family nevertheless Dickerman says the boys mother was becoming increasingly uncomfortable to never land believing that they were being closely monitored and followed whenever they left the ranch. The family felt like they were under house arrest at the Jackson compound Dickerman said it led her to fan criminal defense lawyer Mark Garagos who had already been hired by Jackson Dickerman said Jackson the reason staff engaged in despicable behavior and that the children were hounded harassed and terrorized. Dickerman said Jackson or his agents were surveillance and photographing the Charterland school, even dropping under phone conversations and possession of the family's belongings and holding the family's passports and visas and maybe even master cards. The passports were arranged for them by the Jackson staff allegedly to send the family out of the country. Dickerman said Jackson the staff might have with how the documents because of they showed that they had the passports and the visas. It might suggest they were trying to send them somewhere, you know. According to sources Michael Jackson associates proposed that the family relocated to various places among them Phoenix, Australia, Brazil, or Argentina, or maybe now Mars would be good. Garagos spoke to ABC News and the tailed before the gag order was issued. He told McFad that the child and the family have made up all the allegations of abuse called then just the latest attempt to shake down his client with false accusations, Jacknessfully did not kill. Dickerman sees the child story differently. He believed the boy was molested without a doubt. Without a doubt he said. Dickerman says that the alleged victim he was very very reluctant to speak his sister and brother were but of course they were empty alleged victims. And it wasn't easy especially because he had been humiliated. He also really adored Michael Jackson. Sources told prime time the boys given many details of the alleged molestation including that Jackson gave his sister vodka and him and his brother wine which they say Jackson called Jesus Jews. Sources also told prime time that alcohol was detected during a blood test for the voice cancer treatment. According to a source of person who was not a member of the family also corroborates the drinking, but asked about these allegations if Jackson gave the boy wine sleeping pills or showed him pornography. Dickerman said, I can't say these are all part of the case. I don't want to step on the DA's toes. In the meantime the trial is still many months away. The family is moved on to disclose location and there's concern about these still fragile health of the boy. They seem to be doing okay if basically being a prisoner in your home is okay. Dickerman said they were sent not essentially in hiding. They are absolutely in hiding. I didn't like that. They are absolutely in hiding. Not just essentially they're doing it. Got more Michael Jackson stuff later even though nobody everybody pretends they don't care. Michael's own supporters are harassing the boy. Yes you do. I just want to see his ass fried. Brother, you go that's why I'm using all of this. Or speaking to somebody who might get his ass fried but I really doubt it. Prosecutors contact second woman in Kobe, Brian case. Oh no. Wait for you to do this one. Don't Kobe. Yeah. I got the inquirer from yesterday. I got celebrity justice. I got stuff out the answers. It's a lynching. Yeah. That's right. That lynch Bob mentality. It's a black thing. Celebrity justice is learned that prosecutors in the Kobe Brian case of contact at the Portland Oregon Hotel worker. Sources tell celebrity justice that this woman says she had a sexual encounter with Kobe Brian at a hotel where she worked. Celebrity justice is learned that women works for room service at the hotel. Sources tell CJ that the woman disclosed the co-workers that the meeting between her and the NBA superstar was hot and heavy. All right. Ready for that? Yeah. Hot and heavy. Sources post the woman tell celebrity justice she and Brian actually met a few years ago at the hotel. And he continued to request her for room service on repeat it visits there. I guess this gives new meaning to the warm or the warm room service. Isn't that the warm? That's the warm. Sources say the encounter prosecutors are especially interested in allegedly happening April 2003. Sources claim that Brian requested that the woman deliver a room service. When the woman went to his room, a source tells CJ, Brian began flirting with her and she was receptive. CJ told the two and began having a romantic encounter. According to these sources, the young woman at one point put a stop to think because she felt guilty. She was involved with someone else at the time also knew Kobe was married. These same sources tell CJ, Brian at the woman and began to get intimate again. Sources say the woman finally said, no. No. And the encounter stop. CJ told the encounter didn't get as far as sexual intercourse and was consensual. The incident could impact the trial of prosecutors are attempting to establish an M.O. or pattern to behavior on the part of Kobe Bryant. Celebrity justice spoke with the woman and questioned it was extremely distraught over being a part of the Kobe case. A source says if Sapine and she would testify about her relationship with Kobe, the source says she did however describe Bryant as a perfect gentleman and she says she hopes he's acquitted of sexual assault charges in Colorado and he was hung like a moose, which she said. She said she never signed thing like that in her life, in her wildest dreams. She said even though Swedes in the Elts never saw nothing like this. 1041-19 before 11 at 5.60 QAM. Why do you best in?

I give up my date with Tom Brady after the Super Bowl, just to have Bubba run again. Kick some bush. Robert Blake speaking of kicking bush. Robert Blake's body leased all my identity. Says the inquire. So the assignment says she's the victim of identity theft. By Robert Blake's murdered wife, Bonnie Lee, basically. See, we were right. You were right in the beginning, I went right along easily. The bitch had it coming. Christian, I warned her. Robert Blake is going to travel for Bonnie's murder while I'm still struggling with nearly 20 grand and credit that she ran up in my name's silly told Inquire, in an exclusive New Hube course. I never read Bonnie, but thanks to her no banker credit card company will touch me. After Bonnie died, I learned she was found with my social security card, drivers license and credit cards, dammit. The 46-year-old Florida divorce ace that it wasn't until she was turned on for a $50,000 home loan about two years before Blakely's murder, that she realized somebody to run up a long list of unpaid bills in her name. She filed a case of identity theft with Deltona Florida Sheriff's Department, December 6, 99, but still couldn't get the credit tracking agency to cooperate and remove me charges against her. I had to give up my car because the out of company I financed a true call in my loan and the car was repossessed. It was possessed. By that time, I was so fed up being hunted by creditors at work. I quit my job in less time. The first time, so it was able to connect Bacley's name to the ID theft was shortly after her May 4, 2001 murder. I'd seen a TV report that Bacley, who was from Tennessee, were a number of federal and charges were filed, had a number of false ID's in her position. My friend contacted the LA Police learn that Bacley had my drivers license order when she died. How do you like that? Using my name, drivers license, social security number and data birth Bonnie had been able to obtain a new drivers' license for herself, set up bank accounts read mail boxes, operate and escort business and other credit cards, order credit cards. Recently, I ran into my ex husband Robert Stefano and we compared notes. Robert told me that after we divorced he married Linda Gieluus, the sister of singer Jerry Lilluus and a friend of Bacley, you follow us, you connecting the dot. When Robert separated from Linda, he left behind some of his possessions which were stored in her attic, later he found out from Bonnie, her substitute obtained my ID from among his belongings. If I could tell Bonnie just one thing, it would be that she ruined my life that miserable fuking bitch. In 98, in Little Rock, Arkansas, Bacley was sentenced to three years and charges of possessing false ID after she was covered a slew of drivers licenses all bearing different names that miserable bitch.

Already Palm Beach County ballots are printed in several languages. Well just anyone would be good. Yeah, pick one. Yeah. But maybe English might be something. Okay.

Who used to be just a horrendous tub and see if you would have watched her biography. They're in a biography channel. You would have realized that she had a problem. Yeah. And that is because you're a daddy with your body. And wouldn't get that on a bed and kept the yank in his teddy bear. It's pretty words in my mouth. What? I didn't say that you didn't have a problem. And in fact, people don't have a problem. What do you mean you see now? Personal now it's me. You all the fat people, all the substance of you.

How about Louie Anderson? Oh, it's speaking of that. Oh, God. Wow. Yeah, her word for cable may be as well. Burn your TV. Is it a fox show or is it like a syndicate? It must be syndicate because Channel 7 when I was home. The day that I was sick, back to back, they have two half hour versions of family feud. Louie Anderson, if you thought he was bad, and he was, he was the worst. I thought, but this guy with a mustache, have you seen it? No. Oh, the chiniest cheapest set. And this guy, when they come up with the answer, the family comes up with some answer. And he just got a stand there and does we know what to do? He wants to say something funny. He isn't capable of doing. He just kind of like stands there like in freeze frame, like in, in no-mo. That's a looting. Wow. He's already an assistant. Anyway, a screw-in in both Griffin. That sounds lovely. Roy. Eliza Dushbag and Charisma Carpenter and Monica Winsky and Swelry Clinton. That's a good start. And we got a good list going. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16. All by the way, the fourth quarter, not too good. The growth, fourth quarter growth. Mark had his second little bit. How do we start like, they were not fooling anybody. Especially the people who really are out of work. When the job market is weak, the US government historically has switched on temporary emergency aid payments to the unemployed. Doing so is smart economic stimulus policy. It doesn't cost too much in the grand scheme of things. And we prepare for the eventuality by setting aside rainy day money at last kind of about 20 bootin. But these days, the compassionate conservatives are running the government. They're sitting on their hands. Last month, a lot of emergency unemployment helped to expire. And now they're watching passively as thousands of families every day slip between the cracks without a paycheck and now without any government help either. These center on budget and policy priorities, setting Labor Department data, estimates that 375,000 unemployed workers will exhaust all of their benefits by the agenda, where which last time I checked this weekend. CBPP says that the largest number of abandoned unemployed since records started being kept 1973 is right now. Based on the latest data, CBPP ads, nearly 2 million unemployed workers are expected to be in a situation doing the first six months of 2004. And that's a prediction that even assume is modest improvement in the labor market. Just unbelievable unacceptable, man. I smell a bush slide in November. I can smell a can't you? We need another tax cut for the well being. Scotch says, here's a couple of ways that they lesbian couples list. Christy Hallie from Cheers was a real broker now. And R&B singer Chaka Khan, who seems to put on weight with every bread. And also says, in Pete Bush now pissed off and listening online on New York. Go, you go, Scotch.

Tell her. I'm Dr. Julius Steinberg. Quite a presidential candidate. How did you call me Judy? Not Judge Judy. That's a different misguide. People want to know why I'm hardly ever on campaign fair with how he. Hey. Did you get a good look at me in Iowa? I scared a crap out of myself. I make for off a business. I look like a Shayna Poonam. Stop me if I'm bombarding you with too much Judy. Anyway, how he says after I showed up his numbers drop it. No, I say that's a bunch of misguide. For those of you who don't have to compete with Judy, that means crap. How is a good guy? Though he's what you might call a loose cannon. He's got a pretty bad temper on him. I remember one time, one of our kids left a cap off of the toothpaste. I thought he was going to blow a gasket. The veins tapped out in his head and that white spit strings were born in the corners of his mouth. He went with sugar. I spent 23 years with this shagots. Most of the time he's a mench. But on occasion, I hate him. I think my husband, how he would make for a very good president. One of the things I'm a little peo about is that how he doesn't let us have a TV. I've got a watch section in the city. I got a shut down to campaign headquarters, or to the croakers, to watch on some tiny black and white set. I have never seen any program in color. So I'm not Jackie Kennedy. Hell if you look at me, I'm no Ted Kennedy. I don't wear makeup. I'm like a whisker away from being a mish. Don't expect to see much more of me during the campaign. The only reason I'm addressing you today is because I was able to chew through my restraints. Anyway, Gazagazon, that's Yiddish for that to do this time like it's over and out. Pete for about a committee to elect John Kerry President. From 18 at 560 WQM it's a beautiful thing. Did she say a whisker or a whisker away whisker? Anyway, Michael's own supporters are harassing a boy attorney says in the inquire of this week. And if it's an inquire it must be true. Am I right? Absolutely. Got it. Even Moneau. The Kansas Dricken Black used accusing Michael Jackson of Chomolis faces has been terrorized by death threats. And as the attorney says some have come from Jackson supporters, the inquiry has learned exclusively. Authorities are taking the threat so seriously. They've offered the boy in his family police protection. The Santa Barbara district attorney's office has been aware of these death threats. A source posted investigation told the inquiry. They initially offered to go in his family 24 hour police protection and they keep in contact with the boys mother on a continual basis. The threats began about a year ago after the boy appeared on TV in a martin vishir documentary. There have now been, what is my machine to go back there? All paper stuck. Paper jam. Whistle atone. I can't afford life at all. Come on, it's way. Why are you out for a night of it? Well, so you're out. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Anyway, the threats began about a year ago after the boy appeared on TV in a martin vishir documentary. There have been new threats against the boy in his family since Jackson was charged. And the kid remains in seclusion. There's a twisted belief that somehow these threats will scare the boy in his family from going ahead with their testimony against Jackson. Sadly, this is terrible. Additional stress on the boy as his health is now in question. As the inquiry recently reported the boy's one function of kidney is failing, and he disbelieved a kidney transplant to stay alive. And it goes on and on about the threats and the fact that they only stopped the first time after. After the boy's attorney built Dickerman took the drastic step of right new Jackson's lawyer Mark Garagos about them, and the harassment stopped he said after right in the letters. The intimidation took place in February, March and April 2003 after the vishir program aired on TV. They were threatened, harassed, follow and videotaped. These were Jackson supporters, the family was scared to death. I wrote letter to Garagosan demanded that it stop, and was only when I sent the second stiffly-worded letter that the activity all stopped. Garagosan of course never admitted or denied either way what would did that the harassment came from the Jackson family and supporters. But we know it did. The bunch of thugs, baby, a bunch of thugs surrounding the club one. 5605056, the pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. WDQA and hello. Yes sir. Yeah how you doing? Pretty good. Okay.

And it was a co-conspirator that wasn't charged in the papers and the reporters. And I think some of you have agents were wondering why wasn't he charged. No one knew the answer. But they found out that he had that there was a drone flying out in your man. And the so called co-conspirator that wasn't charged was in a truck and they blew his ass up. Alright. Excellent. I hear it was on a way to Buffalo Raceway in Hamburg as well. I heard. Okay. Thanks to the bad news. I didn't see this thing about lack of one because of lack of interest. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Get that a mate was okay but like they're saying today too many damn debates already. Okay. Let's get on with it. Same questions, same topics, same trait lines repeated back over again. And carry as much as I'm enthused you know that he's kicking ass. This business about don't let the door hit you on a way out. Why does he at least have the balls to say it hits you in the ass when that'd be great? That would be good on the bait. Al Sharpen would say that. Don't let the door hit you in the ass on a way out. He would say that. He would say that. I'll tell you one thing. I'll sharpen if we could just put his guts. His brain, his big mouth inside one of the other ones inside John Edwards body. Change the complexity of the complexity of his candidacy forever. That thing we had to begin with as sure I should probably repeat that on those poles. Alright. Pretty exciting. I think. For anybody who cares. Although the seven states and in a course to show you the whole system blows. And at the very least they should do regional primaries like six of them. Like the northeast, the southeast, the Midwest, the south, west and far west. Right? Right. Six regional primaries over a period of a couple of months. Again and over with already in stuff with these endless debates. And the same question in Tom Broke with his speech effect. Go move move move move like that. Not already. Remember. I did like that thing last night Sharpen corrected him because he did keep saying nation of Islam. Nation of Islam. Right. He's a nation of Islam. He's a group of radical fundamentalist Muslims. And finally Broke had a backup. And then Sharpen made some kind of misdeme. And Broke, I'll rather just let him go on because we don't want to hear Broke. Well, now we're even. It's what a peep. Oh yeah. Get lost time. You suck. Get stand time, Broke. Or Peter Jennings. Don't worry. And what's the frequency, Kenneth? In Missouri in these ugly pole today. Release this morning. Kerry's got 45% Edwards 11% and nobody else is even in double digits. You following that? In Missouri, which is a pivotal stay right there in the middle of the god damn man. They're smack in the middle. They're doing smack. 45% for Kerry 11% for Edwards. In Arizona, Kerry's got 38% West Clark 17 and Howard Dean 12 in Arizona. And Julie Brumman who is endorsed by the big newspaper there they say. Oh, Castle Huis. In South Carolina, Edwards is in a statistical tie with Kerry Edwards 25. Kerry 24% it says with the full effect of Kerry's endorsement by representative James Clyburn. The state's most influential black leader yet to be felt so Kerry is rising and actually could win South Carolina in the less. And in Oklahoma, finally Wesley Clark found a spot. Oklahoma. Or even a Red NX can't handle it. Clark has 27% Kerry 19 and inwards is a this is 3% with 17%. Paul net. Nope. Now I'll say again the two candidates who say the things that make the most sense are the most forceful who are the most logical who get a list of the most respawn.

The amount of the settlement was not disclosed as part of the deal Cardinal Bernard Law before we're disgraced our Bishop of Boston has agreed to meet privately with the women's four children fully met the master. Maybe he's going to make him an offer they can refuse. Foley was removed from industry in December 2002 after his personal release publicly including records detailing multiple affairs he had with married women. The case also contributed to laws downfall he resigned as the Archbishop shortly after details of Foley's actions became known. Foley admitted law on other high ranking church officials in 93 that he had been involved with Perry in the 60s and 70s. He also told Ola they had been with Perry on the night in 73 when she fathily overdosed on Barbbiturits. Ready for that? No. He was wither for many years. For 30 years Perry children believe that their mother died alone of a drug over those barhoyoga's child Emily then three was a sleep upstairs. No the other children was home that night. Perry's children now in their 30s and 40s had no idea that their mother had a relationship with Foley until James Perry now 39 saw a star and Boston TV in December 2002 about a priest who had been a fair with a need a woman who died in 1973. And on a close at great life. What a disgrace. What a fricking disgrace man. You people in that religious fragment and you keep subsidizing keeps putting the shackles in a plate that's all I'll tell you to absorb your guilty conscience because you might have touched it this last week. Were you thinking about it? Yeah don't do it. Don't touch it. WQM hello. Anya I got off your pole. All right. I just hope no one beat me in a punch on this one yet. Christine Aguilar and Brian Northhouse. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ever seen the two of them together? Same person. Same guy. Now Josh isn't going to put that on the reason. No he says no. Right. You never know. Josh can be a little spastic at times. Broward students out didn't drama competition for flag cutting scene. Huh? Flag cutting? Were you listen? All right. The play praises patriotism but the judges only saw teens cutting up an American flag. It was enough to disqualify our expression McCarthy high students from a traditional way. For their performance of the children's story. In the play first published in 63 by show gun author James Clavel? I don't know. Sure. James somebody. You're a greater James Carval. Third graders in a classroom in the west that has been defeated by a powerful army presumably communist cut the flag into pieces. Their new teacher tells them if the flag is so good everyone should get a piece and tells them the hand out to shreds. It's a message about the dangers of mindless political indoctrination. Oh it's so timely. The play is actually pro-Americans in Aaron Fraguera. Well Aaron, forget about it. Aaron Fraguera 15 is sophomore at the Southwest Barricounties School of Work and the Production. It was intended to be an anti-communist message and the judges just turned it around on us. What a fashist country man. Zach Enson who worked in the play added people just didn't look about what we were doing for what it was. We never intended for this to be a malicious gesture. It's part of the play. It's part of the story. You idiot asshole judge. God. MacArthur was competing against 10 troops from Barricount Public and Private High Schools at the Florida State Thest Beans Lesby industry 13 when I play competition at Nova High Monday and Tuesday. After receiving complaints about the flag cutting, Coach Herman Melley Wick to teach his drama and Pemperpines charter high disqualified the MacArthur team. God. Melley you are Schmendrick okay? Some people came to me after the playing complaint about the performance work so so I looked into it. He said he basically decision on Florida statute 876.52 which says whoever publicly mutates the faces or tramples with intent to insult any flag of the wish of the guilty of a Mr. meaner of the first degree. I try to stay as objective as possible as they performed where it said, my problem was they took an American flag off the flag pulling cut into pieces they were disqualified based on a Florida law. Jim Osher from American Heritage School in Plantation one of the three judges said about he was grossly offended by the flag cutting. He didn't face his rating of the play on it to give the play a fair rating the lowest based in overall performance. Witt said until she hears otherwise that his qualification will stand but constitution lawyers and theater buffs say Wick may have gone too far. For ten years it's been clear that these flag dissipations statutes are unconstitutional said Bruce Rogo a Novicell teaching University Law Professor specializing in constitution law and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government and the government but and can all have verändert and that's still a to QM hello.

Frank opened for three minutes after a guard press the wrong button. A month after prison was beaten. Did that bring us some armus hat. The inmates stayed in their cells. And no one was injured during Wednesdays. The police said, Dean at Tyler, a spokesman for the. Varner Super Max unit. The guard whose name wasn't released was fired the same day. I can't imagine why everybody's in total a few mistakes. It could have been a bad situation, but luckily it wasn't. The incident happened very, very fast. She said, the guard who opened the doors was in a control room. Another guard was in the unit with the inmates. The door button has a cover, but a prison. The prison was considering more safeguards. The fast release feature allows quick evacuation case of a tornado or a fire. And December 51 year old Jerry Ward was found beaten to death. Another section of the prison after 78 cell doors opened. I'll respectfully because of a candidate with Bayer. Oh, come. They just, they sat in their cells. Nobody came out. Hmm.

He was on there. Oh, okay. He was on there, but his response was kind of limp as you can see. Have a great day, pal. I mean, John Holmes. Again, he'll find precise things if that's your thing. I mean, in terms of in terms of his gross test. Oh, Jesus, talk, Mark. He made me look like, uh, bright at a time. Great. That's how ugly he was. He was gross. He looked like Britney Spears.

On our squeak with a big ass. And sloppy. Rectome for Loppi. That's it. You got them on thanks. Open. Tony cigarette or wants to hover over that. See Tony cigarette or want to be with Anna's is excuse. That's why he's a silly person. Stop and think of everybody you know who went to you. Okay. They're all silly people. The beast. Silly person. Right. I don't got friend Boba from high school. He's not. But he is Catholic. Our clearance. Silly person. Tony cigarette. Yeah, right. My case. Team curfews added in some towns challenged others. The case is a question punctuated a popular late night news catch in Chicago. It's 10 30 the anchor would say you know where your children are. It was a reminder to parents that anyone younger than 17 was supposed to be off the streets in obeying a city wide curfew. Well, that remains an effect today. Back then curfews weren't questioned. They were they just were that's not the case. No, no. It's not fair. They think all kids in bed were not 13 year old Jose reg. A lot of said as he took a break from an evening basketball game at a Chicago YMCA. You know what he was doing there. There it was. No. Why? He and other teens there complain that police go out of their way to hassle them even when they're rushing home shortly after curfews began. Now even as a number of cities from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Alphabet, and Joja are pushing to add curfews and intent to cut crime. Others are being hit with lawsuits that challenge their curfews constitutionality. I think that white people and Latino people should not have any curfews after dark. Right? Of course, depending on what kind of lot is there. I think sometimes people tend to be very dark. It's hard to keep track of when it's really dark outside. So unless of course they learn to flash their teeth right. What could you do that brown bag test? Yeah. I think we need to brown bag test and some of the names on this pool to be honest. 560505060 don't me forget that thing about Laci and Stacey, but if I do forget no big deal.

Man, I wanted to just barfe all over his god damn, Yarmuka. He makes me sick. Cox uncovered new motive for Laci murder. And it is he didn't want to have no baby. Perhaps pursuing a case against this is the inquirer. Percelling the case, believe the real reason he did away with his pregnant wife Laci is that he didn't want to be a father. In another world exclusive scoop, the inquirers obtained information that reveals police discovery through interviews with multiple important witnesses that Laci Peterson was heard and angry with husband Scott gave every sign. He didn't want the baby who's arrived, she was so equally awaiting. So instead of just getting a coat hanger like they did in the old days, I've been out of shape and evidently may have murder. Yeah, yeah. Laged. Well, you got to cover your ass, man. I'm not going to be like the inquirer and say, hey, kill the bitch. He's like Robert Blake. We don't really care if he did or not because we know the bit had it coming. He killed the bitch. Who? Robert Blake? Yes. Well, maybe didn't like the dinner. Christian Warner. Welcome to QM. Hello.
