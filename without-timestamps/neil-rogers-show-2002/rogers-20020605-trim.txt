That's just the way goes I guess I mean it's only one thing one word I can think of to describe that stupid, but that's just the way code Why is this so loud in here this overhead and everything must be you know it is not me I got a cranked well maybe by coming from the control room maybe they got it goose-tucked I got a ghostway up in there. Yeah, maybe some what are you dicking with an hour one? Or they know I That it must be they're dicking with it the other room now. Okay by the way the new Roger shows coming up next year on 560 WQA M the highly way to the around your show Yesterday speaking of this program we asked a very important pool and boy this audience just had a field day there feeling it When Neil was on vacation how did you like the George and Joe show we asked yesterday? I'm sorry the Joe and George show Well, I mean it went back and forth you know the game players out there to people who live for our surveys every day they decided to uh, you know Stick it everywhere they could here's the way it came out 1300 he folks And I bet you at least 40 of more like real Oh wait a minute here it's a re-refercing and it is mild 1306 Joe was good George sucked 270 I listen a lot of was fine to 165 I didn't listen to it at all 237 I listen very little I hated it 231 others two categories 35.7 percent about 36 percent That just can't handle it that need to sound of my voice George was good Joe sucked 165 12.6 percent And I listen every day it was great 138 10.5 percent a tremendous response A phenomenal response from the psychotic audience out there this is kind of stuff like a synch their teeth into uh, they love it I noticed uh there was a phenomenal upset last night I'm not talking about a stupid soccer game I'm talking about the Stanley Cup playoffs game one Those Carolina Hurricanes most of us sold them short and I should have known better after watching him beat the leaps two to one three times in overtime and at series There's just something about them that little archers are made that son of a bitch and then the course old Ronnie Francis who scores the winning goal on overtime Once they got Detroit in overtime last night. I'm saying to myself you know something the red rings are in big trouble They're in deep crap big crash and there goes Ronnie Francis early in overtime. Which seems to be their pattern. They don't like to stick around too long Sticks it right in behind hashick and Carolina beats Detroit three to it overtime Then here anything about that except on the updates this morning nothing about that all I heard was World Cup World Cup Org you see like I said yesterday Nobody cares about soccer in this country they care about in the rest of the world is very very big But nobody cares about that here. It's like it's like the brits with that whole thing with a monarchy With a queen and there were a million people in the streets waving their little British flags and living in the past You know what when the distant past Trying to re-regail themselves with the memories of the great British empire When it could actually even beat up on lost malviness or whatever it hello was the fucking islands just falcom But then out they can even like beat themselves there so infinite But today they're running around with little flags because everybody wants to feel good about themselves It's all this jingle waste a course crap But the rest of the world doesn't care about that while the Canadians care about a little bit I noticed it was on their news a lot Because they still have the queen on their currency I think we added like take George Washington off the $1 bill and put my picture on her I mean my can't we have a queen on our currency too sounds good to me $1 bill should be the $2 bill. How about the $3 bill? I think that would be good So here's our poll question for today Which of these are you most interested in now these aren't all necessarily? They don't but it's not just a sports thing because this is not a sports show is it? Oh good Thank God and you sports nerds out there man you people just you slay me you just kill me Which of these are you most interested in hockey the British monarchy soccer? Women's basketball baseball cock fights or don't care about any of them Didn't that cover a lot of territory? What I do a poll baby? I give you a wide spectrum I give you a big choice make no mistake about it So you can like you know kind of survey the situation check out the landscape if there's a butt ass smell it and then you know go right ahead and proceed to do whatever you want What should these are you most interested in? I'm so glad I came back for these few days man. I'm having a great time here and everybody Also ought to be having a great time too, but we got some uptight old farts around us doing it Just refuse to loosen up even just a little bit you know that's very sad to me It's very sad just a radio show or just having a good time or here to entertain we're not gonna change the world We're not gonna change mankind we're not gonna change human nature Even subhuman nature we're just doing a radio show having a good time And boy the kind of psychosis that I'm talk about smelling it You can smell it in the hallways here. It's unbelievable and everybody's waddle around up and on how Pappa pappa pappa you this is like a What do they call the old women When it get to getting the oh the hands the like a hand party yeah It's unbelievable Speaking of hands, you know, I was watching one of the old Hollywood square things on a game show channel a couple weeks ago And that was back in the what in the 70s I would say? Yeah, definitely not later than the 70s and Paul in they had the the question was what do you call a castrated chicken or castrated rooster He says oh is that the one that just goes a doodle do? And I thought to myself you know for the 70s. I'm shocked that they let that on the air really and Of course, we're going backwards. They bleep all in the family now Really replayed because that's John ascractes in there out too. Yeah So if you guys like to pay by doesn't have like shoes and socks on also they like bleep though They're your feet out because somebody might be in it have a foot fetish Oh, so not just do they cover up that statue with those teeth on there, but they oh and what was the great thing I saw was on Serine that live this past weekend where they showed the where they did a bit on ascract I missed it and he was making a big speech about you know cleaning things up and they took away the statue from behind him with a breast and then Instead of this replaced by a David with a penis hanging out. It was a lovely thing Anyway, let me give that thing again just in case Eric wants to hop right on it Let's get that other thing off of there already because they're still voting on there 13 every 12 votes a spectacitor response. Maybe we can do the same thing again today And don't give me a song in advance about oh soccer is great in the USB portugal nobody cares all right I hate to break the news to you a lot of you banana boat people you care because like in Brazil and Venezuela and Colombia I mean Columbus got to have something beside just cocaine in the murder you know But when once you get north of and I want about Mexico are they begin to soccer? I I think they are okay Once you get north of Mexico, which unfortunately is Texas, but once you get past there Nobody really cares about it. I hate to break the news to you just and of course the hockey thing I do understand it's not a U.S. thing. It's uh, but I do mention it because I love it and I live in Canada anyway Which of these are the most are you most interested in hockey the British monarchy soccer women's basketball baseball Cockpights we had to put one for the Julios on their cockpights and or don't care about any of them Very excellent the choice of categories for there today outstanding poll if you ask me George didn't see the thing on the news last night about the guy in Texas and the pickup truck the video But the high speed cop chase Sure, if something had a chance to see that because a lot of people in joy see and I kind of crap in the guy didn't really get killed Or at least not as of last night. He was in a pretty bad shape and you don't understand if you saw He finally drove right off the highway into a pillar And it wasn't the pillar of salt unfortunately was like a concrete pillar into that that thing that big pickup truck is folded up like an accordion And he's still alive I guess released as of last night, so a little bit of excitement therefore Because now that we got all these people running around with their video cameras in the course of the year The TV people over the cruise every 10-day of a high-sweet chase.

It's quite a production wasn't even a queen being pressed with that and that's the shortened version This queen was impressed with it anyway. We got the my vote on there on the pool and that's it Poles already up there which these are you most interested in? It's already up there not getting the tremendous immediate response way at yesterday Well they have a chance to like hate Here's a very important story that no George is going to be excited about McDonald's settles beef over fries McDonald's corporation is agreed to donate $10 million to Hindu and other groups to settle lawsuits filed against the chain For mislabeling french fries and hash browns as vegetarian I got to be honest with you. We now aren't particularly fond of vegetarians on this show. We like our meat Right, they'll find for them, but they're militant about it. Let me see it again. We are fond of vegetarians in a first place And especially if you're a militant vegetarian if you're one of those pet-up people for example We actually a despise you like poison McDonald's also posted an apology on its website acknowledging that mistakes were made in communicating to customers about the ingredients in the fries and hash browns The vegetable are used to prepare the fries and hash browns was not pure but contained essence of beef for flavoring purposes What do you think is in essence of beef? I don't know beef No, that's your how stop and think about that essence of beef, you know I mean it might be some people having a little brunch right now. I would choose oh Goese them gently Essence of beef. Don't sound too good to me We sincerely apologize for any hardship that these miscommunications may have caused among Hindus Vegetarians and others the company said an apology posted June 1 on their website Seattle attorney How we shbarty said yesterday that a judge gave his tentative approval of the deal last month McDonald's folks women and her rosin it said the money the company will be paying out to go to Organizations at deal with issues late to concerns raised by customers consumers you people People dumb enough to eat a McDonald's McDonald's was first sued over the fries in Seattle last year by three vegetarians including two Hindus who don't eat meat for religious reasons Law suits were subsequently filed in Illinois, California, New Jersey and Texas The lawsuits were filed on behalf of any vegetarian away McDonald's fries after 1990 that was the year the company Nonstice restaurants would no longer use beef at to cook fries not only pure vegetable. I would be used But they lied Kind of like Dr. Dick that time you know when they said oh he said it was gonna be here at 245 He lied while McDonald's lied to a lot of lying going on these days That's basically what it's all about. I don't think that pull is really up on my it's on my screen But I got the feeling it's he still don't be right. He's did the little one it Quit dealing with an eric god damn it. Well, it's speaking of that thing about vegetarians There was so oh The thing with the Olympics in Seoul where they're gonna be serving up dog Now I must tell you and even as a dog lover that I am the more I think about that what difference does it make? A calf is a nice little animal too right you can pat a calf on a head huh? No She can I guess you could have it you ever you were never in the F a F future Whatever the thing or the face the farmers of America What I want yeah, you never went to like the county fairs done like a lot of cows and Interacted within the country. Yeah, but you know the county fair You can go and you can pat the little animals on ahead and the calf is acute little animal Can't have a cow for a pet and how about people here like the idea me? Yeah, what about that? That's my point That's my point and that is that as much as I love dogs to them. It's part of their culture They like dog they we like a one way they like them another way like kind of like me and well You know sometimes they have pet dogs they showed in one of the national geographics Yeah, he dog butcher and he had pet dogs Well, I wouldn't think of doing anything to that But maybe people like who work in the uh meat industry like the people in Omaha Maybe they have a pet calf at home on a farm a lot of those people are farmers why not? It's a possibility So I know what that's he just doesn't sound right but you have to start adapting to what the cultures you have to Sir understanding the way other people think because basically what the world is about today is the I was thinking this coming to work To this morning the civilized against the barbarians That's really what it's come down to even on a local level Well, we're the civilized here I've been here like five days now. I haven't seen any what is in this building? Oh and speaking of that by the way The driving here still sucks. You know Tom jik has said I was gonna lose touch with what was going on not being here Nothing has changed and it sucks even worse than it was before it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse and may are ping-a-pakini He's got a new scam. I see Got a new penny a sales tax or half penny sales tax whatever you can put over on a public to put on a ballot this fall to improve transportation The sun sent us got a herniatic effort there making to try to like make something on nothing What they don't understand is that this isn't like most other markets You can't take mass transportation and go somewhere and then walk We've been take shuttle buses what were you gonna go? You can go downtown downtown Miami nobody wants to go downtown Miami, but other net where are you gonna go? They're they're it's just not built like that this area isn't doesn't it doesn't exist So you can keep pipe dream and all you want but it's nice to see the mayor's got another good scam Cooked up and I see Robert Steinbeck is sucking up him in the paper this morning, which I won't waste my time reading that Focusing on visitors to us plan calls for registration photographs and fingerprints here we go get the boots the margin boots ready Oh and speaking of my cough which I'm coming along just fine getting the last of the dark green stuff out of there But in yesterday belly aching about the doctor there and Hollywood Thinking that they were gonna send me which they did send me that so supposed blood testing clinic The good news is that my friend Ed there facts me that the information about his place Are real nice little place and I'm made an appointment. I'm going there after work today to get my blood drawn and just to see what's going on my cholesterol things like that And come to find out it was verified to me that they placed that they sent me was a place for like deadbeats and criminals and scumbags and And I guess there's some people figure probably I feel fit right in haha yeah Being a scumbag that I am The justice department is discussing a controversial plan that would invoke a World War two law to require thousands of visitors to the US to be registered and fingerprinted sources said Let's finger print him The idea immigration lawyer says has been floating around for months as reports continue to show that the government has no reliable way of keeping track of thousands of visitors to Restudent and other non citizens who come to this country each year like George for example He just wandered in a rubber wrap one day and they haven't found him yet. Dolphins help me aimed at terrorists I didn't even know you know the coach you know Aim the terrorist those hostile to this country the new plan would apply to visitors from Cuba Oh, that's first on the list Cuba yeah Iran Iraq Libyan or Kareya Sudan and Syria countries already listed his terrorist states But also from Pakistan Saudi Arabia and Yemen according to MSNBC which first reported this plan Those visitors would have to fill out registration form and allow inspectors with immigration naturalization Service to take their fingerprints and photos if they plan to stay in a country for 30 days or more Under current rules only visitors from four countries Iraq Iran Libyan Sudan must go through that process the moment they arrive The moment they step step step foot on ashore as opposed to the people from Cuba who the moment they step foot on ashore get an old beat up Chevy and a driver's license and a bunch of scrap Pictures of alien Foreigner seeking to live in the US are photographing or printed must provide detailed background information to the government But the same is not required of most visitors US attorney general John asked crock beef lawmaker yesterday MSNBC says and sources said he could announce the plan as soon as tomorrow If the details have heard are true and alarms me said gene butterfield or heads the American immigration lawyers association It's another example of overreaching about the justice department she said a registration process does not Residentify those who are gonna do his harm are they the ones who are gonna come forward and register? I don't think so she said The justice department has decided on a final plan an immigration lawyer said they hope they can modify before it does become final the plan Reportedly will be offered versus a proposed rule open a public comment if all goes in a will fight In other words another dog and pony act Put on a good show putting on the rits to the public make it look like we're really doing a good thing and the best part of the deal is We knew who most of these guys were anyway and we still couldn't think of them to be final some of your mommy yet No, do we know whether he's alive? They said that oh Mullah volumar is alive and well and spends most of his time in Afghanistan But shuttles around like to the French Riviera where we hang it out these days. He's having a good time. How do you like that? We couldn't find any of these people with both hands, but hey keep waving at flag USA USA baby, we need Portugal soccer. That's where it's at on a pull us up Which of these are you most interested in 35 votes while I was in the opinion attention there all of a sudden just look to one side and bought a being They went nuts baseball nine hockey eight Hockey eight mole.

Hell maybe to carve Kara Katta Venieri got him Yeah, they don't they don't mess around the kind of an area. They're not like the Polizia who just they're like sluppers But the Katta Venieri when they get you they just The Pope held his public audience attended by thousands of pilgrims and say pyrus square thousands of Getschkees without incident Pastor of St. Brendan suspended boy The Reverend Jose Nixon longtime pastor St. Brendan Katta like church was suspended yesterday after a sexual abuse complaint was lodged against him the Archdiocese of Miami has confirmed He's been put on administrative leave due to a sexual abuse allegation Archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Agostas said Nixon is the eighth priest to be suspended from the Archdiocese since 1998 because of a sexual abuse Accusation for those have also retired since then for the same reason so that sounds like a dozen like the dirty doesn't the me Agostas said father Nixon 55 pastor at St. Brendan at 8725 southwest 30 seconds three in southwest aid since 1982 was temporarily replaced Lady yesterday by the Reverend Charles Peterman all bad name for priest Oh Peterman pretty big She said it's the church's policy this has spent any priest accused of sexual misconduct until the Archdiocese conducts an internal probe if you're part of that expression Actum in the accusation. They're probing it Archbishop John C. Fabular will appoint a response team a committee of church laypeople to investigate the allegation Agostas said the panel will determine where the allegation is credible or not Don't you think the authorities ought to be checking on the allegation? You think yeah, Columbus what least charlacome somebody like that John homes John was It's a John washer would be good and by the way he's Catholic as you know and he's fired up and pissed Are you out this he's been well with our good buddy long history though many many times over the last months since this whole thing blue If I can say that and he is Psychotic about it Depending on the outcome next you could be reinstated as pastor or remove from the church But as removal from the priest and we would require the approval of the Vatican Augusta declined to come out of the nature the complaining gets and exceed the pastor can be reached for comment later today. I'll get everybody else In the past month the Archdiocese has suspended two priests to Reverend Ricardo Castellanos long time pastor of San Isidro and Pompano Beach and now Elher or Greeceyard 62 headed St. Francis to sales on my mv because of allegation as sexual misconduct By a former alter boy by the way it's saying cure and church in Miami Joey Carras and Alasood file last month accused Castellanos 56 of molesting him at San Curre in church I met a lot of LaSalle high school and church a little flower in the Gables when it is between the ages of 14 and 16 from 1970 to 72 we also accused Weeshard 62 of sexual misconduct and little flower church during that same period This suspension came as the Archdiocese of Miami is providing information of past and current complaints for the state attorney's orifice Here's another depressing piece of news boy Like I said not a good idea that I can only get that world cup or number one baby Yeah, you want to say We need Portugal.

I help ship rocket launchers to Islamic fundamentalists in the Philippines But it was only good fun. It was just cruising to the beach. I helped provide cash to train terrorists Gorillas, but all I was doing was topping off my tank before my ski trip if you think your addiction to using gasoline in your car isn't causing any harm Think again Because the money you spend to fill your tank eventually goes to fill the pockets of terrorists I gave the command to kill thousands of innocent people and all I had to say was fill her out some other public service announcements Wanted lane terrorism on drug addicts, but we want to let people know that it's gasoline that fuels terror So whether you're sticking a straw in your nose or a nozzle in your tank Your part of the problem.

Oh, they're kicking a ball up and down a 7000 foot to field there A kicking out of bounds and sideways once in a while actually kick a pass to their teammate, but the other net In fact, I think that all the goals in soccer probably are fixed WQAM Yeah, okay speaking Speaking oh, Neil how are you okay?

Oh you know people are men as slow as Malances god what did I come back here for? Hey hello hello hello. What what a game last night. Yeah, that was unbelievable It was pretty surprising to be honest with you because not a one I think Detroit would blow them up But I thought they would play that real suffocating scout style that Carolina likes to play But I thought that was pretty interesting game Yeah, but you know it's amazing. I didn't realize it till about what was it the third round that a playoff So I noticed that they got some really good veteran players on that team with a Ron Francis and Rob Brindamore Yeah, and the goalie didn't he didn't the goalie used to play for the ducks? No, he played for the sharks the shark. So, okay. Yeah, I think he may have actually played for the Vux for like part of one season It rebanned then he went to Dallas. He's he bounced around after he was with San Jose I knew it was one of those animals. I wasn't sure he beat the red wings with the San Jose 92 or 3 whatever They wouldn't they upset the Detroit? He beat him. Oh wow. I didn't realize yeah But what a game did you see like in the left at the end of the third period when Brett Hall came screamin and down the side And he went to shoot it and they any Stoned them cold right at the goal. Yeah, like that was unbelievable to mend it into overtime You know when you look at the when you realized that Brett Hall is playing on the fourth line and that's sometimes federal plays on a fourth line It's scary. It really is scary and the fact that Detroit lost that game is just quite a tribute to Carolina I hope they win. I really do. I'm rooting so hard for Carolina just because I just hope they get it over with already You know it's a fifth of June somebody tell him it said the middle of June already get it over with would be good idea Well, it's like what they said on sports centers They said that it was gonna sweep but they didn't realize it could be the other way around wouldn't that be sweet? Have a great day pal Go cones go yeah, look out for those hurricanes man. They're on a march Course keep in mind Vancouver also want to first to a indie Troy and then of course just took the pipe So don't get all too excited. Well, let's see we got the 23 hockey fans out there so far which is about 11. I had a soccer and 12. I had a cockpipes WQAM WQAM WQAM Yeah, I just wanted to talk to Neil how to question about one I want to talk from about dolphin panel. It's off season. It's just one WQAM Yes, good morning WQAM. Yes, sir. You know if the ad channel is gonna use that tactic where if you light up your subsidizing the terrorists Legalize the damn thing tax it and use that to fund the warrant terrorism Damn it, you know, no, they you don't understand where you are sir With in America where we just were two uptight about these things Where if you go to Europe, I'm sure you see every time an Amsterdam you see these billboards were there, you know Apportizing something sexual and they don't get up tight over there because it's a human body. I don't see any billboards in Amsterdam Now they mention it really no Oh, they're buying it some of them are buying some of them are gay and some of them are straight Well, I'm gonna go buy some of my pod right now light up go buy some have a good time No, you don't see any billboards. It's just on on me. That's one thing. I don't miss is those big Every billboards, you know, defacing the landscape and You're not when you're in the city You know, you're not inundated with the drugs or sex when you're in the middle of the city Of course you have all the sex shops in the uh, you know, there's a whole lot of very a kinky wild places The red light district and then of course there a Zidian coffee shops all around the city including that one very close by me Where they deliver on motorcycles. Yeah, that's true. That's great. They deliver on motorcycles. That's paradise who blocks from my house Of course I can walk right on over, but at any rate. They're all over the city, but but it's it's a very unostintacious Is not like glitzzy and like that How do I want to say So it's not a big deal is what I'm trying to say it's not a big deal other than for some of the silly tourists like the Brits who come over there and just You know act like I want your assholes because they've been sober pressed and brought up like a bunch of Puritanical or Victorian or whatever idiots See that's our problem is that we just can't that we can't break the chain We like to think that we beat the Brits a long time ago and then we bail them out of a couple of wars No, which is all true, but the fact is we still can't break the umbilical cord At least the Canadians even though they got the queen on the currency. I mean there is so much more progressive than will ever dream of being So at least they understand that they can't the rain and the shadow of the core for majesty forever Even though they do like a queen every now and then WQAM Yeah, that is the same guy.

I don't want to know In infection and is nut But they gave me an A-Bonax and luckily it went back to normal Not the size of a BB five six seven 0 5 60 pound five 60 on the AT and see in Verizon line I'm not sure about this taking these calls, you know, and he ladies out there want to call and say hi This is my last day before I get out of here for four months Any women in the Saudi ins current up to said they're very best. No, of course not absolutely not Do not kidn me and all about this phone crap. I've been around a block a few times WQAM You see here we are same assholes WQAM QAM Yes, yeah WQAM QAM hello I'm going back to my articles, okay, because you people are bunch of assholes Bishops proposals are seen as starting point for debate A child protection plan proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishop sparked heated debate across the U.S. today As Bishop's lay activist in scholar said they would push for changes when Bishop's vote on a policy in Dallas next week The Bishop's draft charter for protection of children and young people was welcome by many who said the documents That the bishops finally appear ready to recognize the damage done over last several decades 2000s of children by the minority of priests who have been sexually active Oh, this is in the Boston here on the course they have to be politically correct, so they say the minority of priests who have been sexually abusive But two aspects of the bishops proposal proved controversial They're planning to allow priests who committed only one of active abuse in the past to keep working for the church and the decision not to suggest any action against bishops who failed to remove abusive priests or ministry Let me say it again. They're making an decision as opposed to the law Preest to have committed only one active abuse in the past can keep working for the church as opposed not only from getting kicked out of the church, but like go to jail where they belong Who the hell are you bishops kitten, baby? We're scaling it back a little bit. I believe and Bishop before I believe these bastards, okay? Bishop William S. Flystead of spoke can vice president of the Bishop's conference called the draft a good start But said in a telephone interview that he would like to see the proposal toughened with a stronger apology on behalf of bishops and a stricter zero tolerance Pratolorez policy now we're talking pops The apology could be even stronger. I think it does hurt for doesn't hurt for us to say that we need to ask for forgiveness and then we made mistakes He'd be saying Scales dad said he expected to baton down us about zero tolerance policy the draft proposes that the bishop seek to defrock any priest who sexually abuses a minor in the future But only those priests who have abused a minor more than once in the past So as we're looking in the past you get one free pass no free pass in the future But depending on what you've done in your past in the in your behind one free pass To molest a kid our own practice in spokean has been that we've taken the one strike in your outer porch skills That said we need to be mindful that we're a forgiving church a reconciling church But for my perspective given a level of anger in the highest expectations at the lady have a priest What I'm hearing is that people are pretty strong about not allowing such a person back into the ministry and you are Our special hearing flint of Saint Paul and Minneapolis who chair the committee that drafted the proposal defend it The decision to give a second chance to some offenders Treatment of the power of Christian conversion has made a difference in some cases flints in however Ministry that involves contact with children a young people will always be out of the question for abusive priests He'd be saying a Parliament seminary rector who's been asked to address the bishops and Dallas next week said the bishop's need to go much further and holding themselves accountable Much much much much further. He said Not covered here is the question of the bishops themselves and in listening to a lot of Catholic lay people last few weeks That is a particular sore point said the Reverend Donald P. Sr. President of the Catholic theological union in Chicago I know another sore point too If it can be demonstrated that a bishop knowingly placed a priest who they knew was in danger with children That is a serious breach in the bishop would be unfit for pastor or leadership There is no restoration of trust until that is addressed And on a coz at very great length, but it's like I said a dog and pony show and It's like they're sticking their finger out the window to see which way to win his blowing and just how little they can get away What would doing you know and see how the the windfall of public opinion and Needless to say there's any enormous gush of its gush it over here squirt squirt public opinion that they you're not kidding anybody Come on just one time.

It says Church documents released yesterday show that top officials of the Boston Arts Dice had extensive knowledge of allegations of sexual misconduct by several priests who were allowed to remain in active ministry despite complaints that he is far back as the 1960s. Now what was that? You're killing people in the building. Good. And some of them are gay. The documents nearly a thousand, and not only that, but some of them are stupid. The documents nearly a thousand pages of personnel records turned over to the family of an alleged victim of the Reverend Paul R. A family and record order provide evidence that Cardinal Bernard F. Law was directly involved in the reassignment of two accused priests. Even though he said in the store a sworn testimony last month that he customarily delegated those decisions as abordinates. In one case, the documents released yesterday show law decided that his own 1993 policy for dealing with priest accused of sexual misconduct would not be applied retroactively to a popular Quincy, Quincy, I'm sorry. Quincy passed the accused of sexual misconduct whom law later promoted to area of vicar with oversight of 19 parishes. In another law recommended publicly explaining the out-of-state transfer of a priest accused of sexual misconduct by saying that he had no previous knowledge of accusations against him, a statement questioned by one of law's own bishops. The records which cover the careers of 10 priest accused of sexual misconduct also provide, the first documentary evidence that the practice of moving accused thirdly from parish to parish dates to the late Cardinal Richard Cushing. By psychic powers again, George. The late Cardinal Richard Cushing led the arts dices for a quarter of a century till 1971, and approved moving at least two priests in the new parishes during the 1960s despite allegations of sexual misconduct. Rod McLean Jr. the lawyer representing the family of Gregory Ford will led to his he was mussed by Shanley in the 80s, said he asked for the records on the 10 priest to read but laws April assertion that Shanley's continuing ministry during the 90s was attributable to inadequate record keeping. The fours are suing law containing that he was negligent in a supervision of Shanley. These records on these 10 priest show there were substantial record keeping, like he said. He's also trying to show that laws actions in supervising Shanley who was arrested last month in charges of raping a child are not covered by the doctrine of charitable immunity, which could limit the liability of church officials on the arts dices and clergy sexual abuse cases to 20 grand. We're trying to show that there was a pattern of conduct to read but the assertion of the arts dices that they were at all times acting in furtherance of charitable purpose, MacLean said the charitable purpose of the arts dices is not furthered by putting admitted child molesters into parishes particularly when parishers aren't told. Laws warned that position in the four cases continuing today and Friday in undisphosed location and in undisphosed location. How do you like that? Where he'll be safe. Yeah, where he'll be safe. I hear it's Louise in the Bronx. I hear it's Brigham's ice cream parlor. Right over there and Kenmore Square. MacLean's request for personal records cover the revins. Well, of course, I want a bunch of names. MacLean's also said on Friday, the arts dices to turn over personal records and all priest. No no no, because the sexual misconduct. We now want all those records MacLean said adding that the request would include the files of approximately 90 priest whose names were referred to law enforcement authorities earlier this year. By church officials responded, they clergy sex abuse crashes that erupted in January. The Reverend Christopher J. Coin in arts diacis and spokesman said that a news conference that he had not reviewed the documents on the 10 priest, attempted to place the action to church officials regarding those priest and historical context. It's partly protective culture of the church that was in existence at the time that sought to not only protect children and their families, but at the same time try to protect the church, try to protect the priesthood. Coin said, right. None of the 10 priest whose records were released yesterday are assigned to parishes, although one Graham was pulled from act of ministry only last February. And allegations of sex abuse against all of them along with the council and some of their alleged victims have been described in previous news accounts. But the records provide new details supporting those accounts and show that several of the priests were allowed to work as parish priests even though top officials knew they had been accused of sexual misconduct. Three of them allegedly went on a molest scores of other young people, scores of other young people. And in FOMNIA is what this is. Remember what they talked about in the godfather about letting drugs and where kids are in the neighborhood, he said that's it in FOMNIA. And that's exactly what this is a freaking in FOMNIA, Mr. Mr. and Mrs. Catlick out there in the USA, when you're going to do something about it, when you're going to stop subsidizing and perpetrating this sick twisted thing. And just like Norm said, when he woke up a few days ago, there's nothing worse than having a sick twisted infected thing. That's right. He said it was twisting it. Well, by the way, shows almost over there in FTL anybody here? No, no, he said the show sucks. That's what he said. It said the show sucks. But he's making a good money for it, more power to him. Get him off our ass. Although George might have to iron pretty soon. I think you ought to like file a harassment suit against this place. Sounds good to me. Been picked on to call all kinds of names. Stupid. Treated like crap for all these weeks over, over. How much a silly like grade school crap. That's the thing that bothers me about the shenanigans that are going on here about the last month. It's all like a bunch of kindergarten crap. Like kids in a sandbox. Goes to show that even when you get into your late 60s, you still can't do sometimes, although I have said it's awful at this little improvement that sometimes people go through a second childhood. They refer it back to their childhood origins again. That explains that diaper thing I never understood. Right. That's exactly right. And the bag thing too. So all you people out there that are wondering what's going on in this radio station. There are a lot of other people wondering the same thing. And by the way, there are many people running around a hallways here who aren't quite so stupid as some people think. That's right. Some people think that they're full of those people. In fact, those folks who think that they're full of anybody. Probably do a better mouth shut. Keep an eye on your mouth shut. Keep an eye on your mouth shut. Because there are a lot of people that like George and like me and like this program in this building as a matter of fact, most of them because they know that this is the god they meal ticket for this radio station. And if anybody thinks that I'm going to be intimidated, I made a bad mistake, but of course, Norma can't should be partly responsible for that for being such a pussy. For putting up with that crap being talked into like back and off, There's no battle or few going on on my part. I'm just doing the NeoWouder show. That's all. Like I've always done. And I will continue doing. That's just the way it is. It's a radio show. You explain that right to somebody's face. And they just aren't capable of understanding that. And how did you get it me off on this tangent again, man? Uh, yes, you did it because you're stupid right. I was just busy here talking about Catholic priest and Cardinal Law and Cardinal Cushing. And Miriam Tolin? Things like that. Francis, oh here? That guy that called yesterday with that Floyd Venable stuff. He does that every time. Every time, about like every four or five years. Every time I mentioned some harness name from the past because of him. And then the one time he actually played the tape of me talking about. Remember that from Zeta? For you people out there that saved tapes from like when I was on a Zidian years ago in different stations. Get a life. Get a freak while I forgot what you live. I'm sorry. That's probably the highlight of the resistance. It seemed to me. 272 votes on our freaking pole today, man. On NeoWouder's.com. Which of these are you most interested in? I don't care about any of them. 82. Baseball 69. Hockey 59. Soccer 25. Cockbites 23. The British Monarchy 8 and women's basketball only 6. Only 6 people on this pole are willing to shield an a hernietic way for Ron Roffstein and that Diekrap that he puts out there pretending it's a form of basketball. Nobody cares Ron. Nobody cares. In a manner how many free plugs you get on this radio station? The fact of the matter is, trust me when I tell you. It's a law of diminishing return. I mean when you got all these sporting events, you got like 4,000 and 5,000 and 7,000 people showing up. I'll say this much for the Panthers and I can't say too much. And at new building of ours out there, four of the five years we've been in there haven't even made the playoffs. It's been an embarrassment. It's been humiliating. It's been degrading. But did we ever have like 4,000 people for a game in that joint? No. And we ever even have 4,000 people in the old Miami arena? No. We did not ever. Ever. Never. It would be scandalous. And of course if we ever did some people on this station would go on here and say, see, nobody cares about hockey hockey sucks. That's what they would say. But the fact of the matter is we usually have our 11, 12, 13, 15,000 people in there. Even for a crap team like these last two seasons, a crap team that a lot of people wouldn't go if you paid them to go. Not because hockey's not a wonderful deciding sport, but because of the fact that product is crap, the prices are very, very high. And the ambiance and all that great either with a bunch of plastic assholes under cell phones. But it's better that we still get our usual like 13, 14, 15, 16,000 people out there. As opposed to these other bogus so-called, see, this whole business, I 20 long time ago, this would all come to a head. I know my head, Mr. Let me tell you right now. It was all coming to a head. Like with the baseball strike that's coming up in August, you'll say that'll be at that'll be the end. All these jackasses making, 13 and 15 and 20 and 25 million dollars a year. Who can ever get enough? Always wine and an crying. Guys who couldn't have made the goddamn Rochester Redwing 30 years ago, guys that are like 180, 2 hitters that are out of, now make it like a million and a half dollars a year. For going out there and scratching or jogs traps. Who the hell are they kidding? And keep j gooseen up those ticket prices and gooseen it up and beg in for Billus Moore stadiums and build us this and do this, you know, polycraft, public tired of it, they're burnt out. They rather gross smoke some dope. Lot cheaper out there to that. This dashed your children, hook you up to something. 5, 6, 7, 0, and I know there's some people like to jerk, hook your job. In fact, old sparky up there, we're not doing much with that these days, now that they, you know, kind of outlawed that. Let's get old sparky up there. I know somebody loved this strap you in. And probably pull this witch. You can look at generator up to an exercise cycle. Excellent idea. He could probably use the exercise too. 1056 at 560 WQAM.

I think he should be swinging from a tight rope. So when you get to Cuba now, go, be stupid now. When you meet with Budell, tell that asshole then. He's going to help you. Yes, all you are going to tell that asshole then. He's going to help you. Farewell. You're not the only part. You're not the only part. You're the only part. You're the only part. You're the only part. Oh, who cut the cheese? It's 11.04.56. You're welcome. Did he say that the Pope would not be stupid? Something like that is what I heard. Well, too late. And this guy, and this old, old, frail creature. He's like, slump it around. He can't even keep his head up. He's like a breath away from death at any moment. And there's a lot of the same stupid ignorant people out there. A lot of the same stupid people. Brain washed masses continue, you know, kissing his asses. Man who's living in a stone and then let me just tell you again, people literally, hey, bop, bop, on golla baby. They don't bother with him. He's not fooling them for one second. Although he does manage doing a great job of repressing them, but that's because he's got the inside with the carabinerie. Probably his console, Yuri from Nevada, is in charge of that. Anyway. Oh, and this is very important thing. I know you didn't like to store it about to broccoli because you don't like broccoli. And I almost choked on some broccoli the very next day. See? Well, I don't think I'll be choked on full-lic acid tomorrow, but I could because I do take it every day. If the pill for you enough, it's not. By the way, if you want to get some good full-lic acid, sundown makes a great product called high-pholic, and that's got full-lic acid with plus on the B vitamins in the right balance. That's great for getting your home all-level down. Homocysteine. And more and more smartdoctors. Now, not dumb. Not dumb doctors. Not brainwash cardiologists to obsess with your cholesterol. But more and more smartdoctors, just like Dr. McColley, whatever his name was, called him and whatever. Now, seriously, remember that he was the one to turn me out of that whole homocysteine thing. That's the important thing, as far as an indicator of heart disease, et cetera. Your home all-level. What are you taking in there right now? These are the girls' vitamins. I steal them. Yeah, but what are they like? Multivitamin and also vitamin C. Forget about vitamin C. Well, what's the... I'm everything. It's a one-day. I'm going to day is not what I'm talking about. You're such a schmuck. You know, I'm beginning to think that most got to pull your little stupid. You know, how many milligrams of what? It's got... How many micrograms of phoaloc acid? You won't have milligrams of 100. How much? 400. That's not bad. And what? How many it's a top it says? Each so many tablets contain all of the following. One tablet, two, how many? One tablet. Really? That's not bad. And it's got the B-Zener, like B3 and B6 and B12? Show enough. There you go. Well, that can't be too bad. Anyway, the reason I've passed this along, I'm begging you to listen to this even though you don't want to, because you might choke on your broccoli. CBS News reports, over the last 10 years, phoaloc acid has developed the reputation as something of a Wonder Vitamin, a simple way to prevent devastating birth defects. How often are you in a position to be able to say take this simple vitamin, and this horrible, birth defect will largely go away, said Dr. Nancy Green, medical director of the March of Dimes. But reports CBS News correspondent, Elizabeth Caliban, the organization that devoted self to the Livering healthy babies is delivering disturbing news about phoaloc acid. The majority of American women who should be taking it are not. Only about a third of women of child-bearing age take phoaloc acid before their pregnancy, phoaloc acid is a v-vitamin that's crucial for healthy development of the brain in spine. Taking before becoming pregnant just 400 micrograms that they can reduce birth defects known as neural tube defects by 70%. So when George has his next baby now, he keeps popping at phoaloc acid. He won't have to worry about any possible birth defects. Phoaloc acid next time he's going to have his own. Because there's something to building to him to go. himself. Phoaloc acid occurs naturally in fruits and leafy green vegetables. The government even puts it in breakfast cereals and breads, but experts say that's not enough. And that all women interested in having children even in the future should be taking a phoaloc acid supplement. Men, many women don't. And not only this, it's not just a thing for women. Trust me what I tell you. It's extremely important for every human being to get a lot of phoaloc acid in your system because it keeps that homocysteine level down. And homocysteine you find in meat. If you're vegetarian, probably don't need as much. I don't know. Because if you're vegetarian, you're eating more fruits and leafy, you're green leafy vegetables. Presumably and choking on your broccoli. But if you eat a lot of meat, put a lot of meat in your mouth like some other rest of us. You need that phoaloc acid. You get that homo level down. First time I had that homocysteine test with it was my level of 16. Not good. Little bit too high, not terrible, but not good. What's it supposed to be? Under 10. Oh. And last time I had that thing was like eight. Got it down as far as six. Perfect ideal from what I read in Dr. McColle, Colkan, Michael Jackson's book was like, I don't know, five or six would be the lowest. But like six are eight or like is great. Six are eight is great. Folic acid. Let me say again, sundown makes phoaloc acid. Is this fax machine broken or not? Because I noticed that I went on before it. It said, because I printed stuff out on there, but I'm talking about the line. How do I think any faxes came over on that today? It shouldn't be out because it said err or something. What does it say now? It says ready. Okay. Then it's working. It says ready when you are. Maybe they just have nothing to do with it because I know it's on the phone. They should have nothing to say. You know, I could go into a long thing. In fact, when I come back from the break, I'm just going to mention a few more things that really frost my ass about phoalcalls over the years on this show. People that think is really an interesting phoalcalls or what talk show, at least to this one, that are not like those vagus people for example. Oh, the pain. 9 minutes after 11 at 5.60.

You know, because then we might actually get some calls. WQAM. Yeah, hi Neil. Yes sir. Okay. Listen, I heard you a couple days ago mentioned rock radio in the old like 20 year old K102 and She. Yeah. I thought that was pretty cool that people remember after all those years. Did you know that she is actually an internet station on the internet local at cheesilyrockarold.com. No, I did not know that. Yeah, and it's a really cool. And there's a facts coming over to machine. I'm sorry, go ahead. I got excited. That's funny. By the way, George does an excellent job when you're not around. He's okay. Yeah, he feels the time. That's for sure. Yeah, he kills us in four hours of it. He's kind of stupid, but other net is all right. Can I just ask you, I used to listen to you years ago. What happened to Glenn Hill? Dead. Oh, my gosh. Well, I mean, you know, I could be around a portion and give a big build up. But he did. He did. I'm a couple years ago. Sorry to hear that. We are two. Yeah. All right. Well, thanks. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. You're alive in local. Thanks a lot. Okay. Live in local. What does that mean? And guess what? By the way, I'm not in the South Florida, I'm in Toronto. How do you like that? All you schmucks out there. Oh, I'm the old's here. That's where I'll be at the track tonight. I'll see. But I mean, what difference does it make? It just live in local. And it says where the F is the justice department. The can there's our good close friend, Ken Maldon, who just brought us in a bulletin. It says where we're going. I'll go home now. Thank you, Ken. What does it say? It's a fact. Apparently when they couldn't get through on that one. They said I see. Well, thank you, Ken. There's a great gentleman in a scholar. Ken Maldon. I'm over those good old days at the Biscayne kennel club. Man, those were the days, Ken. He knows it. I know it. When we had some white people in this town. Where the F is the justice department with this Catholic church. It says I tune in the norm. Ken show when you played because I got high. He was talking about you and Howard David. Please don't take calls as Chris. He was talking about me and Howard David. Who? Hey, that's totally inappropriate. My attorneys on the air talking about me and Howard David. Absolutely inappropriate. Get your own material. Normally, you're only doing one stick an hour a day. You jack as you faggot. You silly person. You you cike. You mucky bastard. What's wrong with you anyway, man? I hope your goddamn testicle swells up again. Just for a few minutes just to get your nervous. God. Talking about me and how are that's kind of stupid. If he asked me. I think the fact machine probably knew we were going to get a facts about norma. Can't. Thanks, Chris. Let's see. Asked to help priest allegedly abused. Are we already had this one already had that sort of. Thank you long time ago. Oh, you we've been all over this thing like stick on mo. Make no mistake about that. There I see. I don't know. I see you looking. Believe me, it's not going to last. It's not like this is going to be some kind of a. You notice how quick I broke the habit up there. I didn't ever want to give the phone number again. And you know, unless I was ready to do. Can you enter the 17 votes on our survey today? Which of these are you, which of these are you most interested in? None of them. Don't care about any of 93. Baseball 83. hockey 69. Soccer 29. Cockfights 27. The British Monarchy 10. And women's backs at ball. Ells soul. Six. Sace. Very weak. Very, very weak. And when people come on this radio station. They start promoting things. You just raise one eyebrow and say, I wonder what that. That's all about. Well, you know, people like to promote crap for their buddies. Just the way things work in a word. You know, you smear my hand and I'll smear you smear your. I'll smear your smear your. I'll smear on you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT and T in Verizon. I might take some calls over the Christmas mommy to. I don't know. It kind of a perverse way. I'm enjoying it a little bit, you know? Did just just a little taste. It's like being back in town for a few days. Don't want to overdo it. And they probably came back for five days. Two of those of course a weekend. Saturday Sunday and then Monday through Wednesday. And here in June, I'm doing again. We'll be doing that again till October. Because once I get back here in October, I'm going to be here a long time. See, that's a smart way to do it. November, December, January, February. Anybody want to be like in that horrible weather in a. No. And of course, nobody wants to be here in June, July and August in most of September either do they. When it's 114 degrees in the shade. And you'll notice we're already getting a real good start on. Oh yeah. Now, get back to what I promised I was going to say. A little instruction for in case we were decide to take calls again after this moment. One of the things that really, well, many of the things. But the first of all, Mad Dog does one thing right. Right. There's many things right. But when he says every day on as far as the calls, because he doesn't do guests, he does strictly calls. Have a point get to it. And that's right. Of course they don't, but nevertheless, but he tries to get into doing that. That's his philosophy. And that's exactly what it's all about when you call it top show. Have a point get to it. What are you calling for? What do you want to say? Not. Oh, gee, you know, have a wonderful trip. And I really enjoyed your for last one. That's great. The boring is what it is. I mean, you know, it's just, it's just, Asclooking, it's boring. I mean, George thinks asclooking is something other than boring, but I want to get into that. I'll save that for tomorrow for him. Facts just coming in, baby. Yeah. Look at that. And then the other thing that business about, and it's only an example. Only an example. But it's such a sad commentary on what a horse ball town is. People are calling me up over the years. If I had a thousand dollars for it, they'll never call it about Vegas. I could be terrible. I could go to Vegas to have a great time anyway. Oh, yeah. You were so right. We took your advice and went to Vegas now at a great time. Wow. Wow. You know what that is? Stupid. Right. Like it took Neil Rogers to tell somebody that Vegas is a swing place in a great time. Can be head by all. See, that's the problem when you live in such a perocule place where you have a bunch of retards who don't go anywhere. Anybody I would say over the age of 21 who makes a few bucks. Now, like you've been out there, when you go to the MGM grand, for example. I'll do you never been to the MGM grand, have you? We stayed there the one trip. Oh, that's right. The second time took us two days to get out of there. When you go to the MGM grand, you see all these living and breathing people like from my would say the age of 21 to 110. I mean, there may be some people under 21, but that out let them worry about checking IDs for as gambling. But the fact of the matter is that anybody over the age of 21 who isn't like working for like a buck 50 an hour. That's what I'm talking about. A lot of people at 21, they're already married. They got a girlfriend, a boyfriend or a boyfriend or whatever they got. And they go out there and they have a great time. It's just nothing revealing about that. There's nothing revolutionary about that. And then to come back and say, oh, you were right. We went out there and stayed at the, you know, and then of course I always get sucked in that we're just they always stayed at the Aladdin. It was really great. Yeah, I'll good. That's boring. It's crap. I, you know, I've only got these last 75 years on that contract. I'm not going to like waste my time. What's a boring cause like that? Or what's a good hotel in Amsterdam? Neal, how about the, you know, one with rooms in a bathroom be good, you know? Four walls in a bath would be excellent. A bed, you couldn't hurt either. Or maybe hang out on one of those youth hostels. Bring your sleeping bag. You know, kind of an extra large one that will fill a couple of extra people in it. And the hang out of the youth hostel. They have communal showers in those things. Don't they? I would assume so if they have any. Yeah. And by the way, speaking of that, youth hostel is okay, but south Florida hostel is not okay. They're spelled differently. So when you go there leave your hostel attitude in town and cut the crap. Oh, yeah. Where's the good place to stay and make it? Where's the good McDonald's out there? Do you ever eat at that crap burger? What's in there in that place? Is it what a burger? You got me? I don't even know what telling him. And I don't call it telling me, I don't want to know. Because I'm never going to go there anyway. I don't call it a burger joints. I'm other made her a millis famous ground brown yesterday for lunch and with an amount of moments I was in there making a brown. That's right. That was my going away meal before October. Millis brown brown brown. Tell me the same stories that she stole the eight million times already, but you know, she means well. She just came to help herself. Nice doctor, mom. I don't you know, I'm before I leave. I think I should give the name of that place on the ear. To think that they sent me over and I'm not because I'm such a big shot, but just, you know, just like an ordinary human being although like you said, I had to kind of a crappy shirt on yesterday, but I didn't wear that shirt that day. How about this shirt? It's still sent you to the free clinic. Yeah, how about what you're wearing at a QAM T shirt? They wouldn't even let you in the free clinic when I teach her it on. He works for QAM. Oh, look at this. Here's the little tiny handwriting. Guess what? Not going to waste our time with the camera. Right in the circular file. Said it to both backspacesheans by the way. Right in the circular file. He's Peter now. I saw it at the bottom of the page. Peter, Jerry, Steve, blow out your ass. Smuck. Stop picking on your co-workers. Yeah, pick on this. Go pick your nose. Puts. Boy, an amazing. The same little scrolling handwriting with instructions of how to do the show and what to say and what to do and what to do and what to blow it out your ass. Smuck. I think I just said that, didn't I? Good. 26 after 11 at 5.60, WQAM. Hey, let me tell you if you want to look as good as the beast. And he got on the scale this morning, 254. Oh! He started this thing. Let me take a look. Ah, oh crap. Oh, see this. Uh, started this thing with 284. I know that was the number. Right on. On three, 15. So that's March 15th April May. So it's two and a half months. He's lost 30 pounds. Nice. God beast. And he's even got like a shiny ball spot. Now, you notice that? His head is gotten shiny. He's like an lucky guy. Got some sun. Pink and healthy now. He said it was pink. He hasn't found it. Yeah, but he thinks it's pink. Anyway, if you want to lose the way to like the beast is doing like how and you know something.

Either that or I got goiter and believe me. I kind of hope it's goiter. Is that a mustache? Oh no. I just shaved it five minutes ago. I'm freaking saskoo. No, I'm French. What's with that bullet in your pants? I have no idea. But it's easier to pee. What's with the package? What do you have 18 nuts in it? You know, you're just trying to hurt my feelings. I'm still sensitive. You're alright. Thank you. Number thirty two five sixty. WCM. How the hell did that come up on there? Is that the wrong disc in a wrong job thing? I think? I don't know. It wasn't what you meant to play. Not even close. In fact, this is number twenty three and it's supposed to be disc 18. Wow. How do you like that? Apologize for being really stupid. Oh, I guess that was okay. Yeah, that was fine. Wrong disc though. Sorry folks. Shannon had to tell him that I could align and said, what I sure was great. What is it? What was it now when I wanted? Level thirty two with five sixty. WCM. I got the mad dog. Jim managed coming up on one o'clock. That's a mildly interesting. It's certainly not as interesting as hey, we had a good time at Vegas. I'm serious. You people got to go somewhere. Go somewhere. Rob a bank. Do you know, go a print up some funny money like what's his name's kid? Who was that? Oh, that was our new mayor in Miami. What else is his name? But you ought to know he's one of your people. I don't live in Miami. Many deas. Yeah, I guess. Well, what do you mean you guess? I forgot all. It was his son that was pretty counterfeit money. He said, oh, well, he didn't mean nothing by you know. All those things. You know, D.A. Listen, when your mayor of a city that's got a bad budget shortfall and you're like, to grasp it around to find a couple of nickels to rub together, it's good to have a kid that knows how to print up some good looking funny money. Cameron detects when he designs. Speak of that. Finding a fugitive already texting the potential for a fire in Davey Florida will become easier, thanks to three thermal imaging cameras recently acquired by the police department in Davey. The cameras from Raytheon company are mounted directly above the lights on police cruisers, inside the car is a 5.1 inch flat screen for viewing. A joystick is located next to the screen enabling the officer to move the camera 360 degrees around as well as an up and down motion set, Lieutenant Gary Killam of the Davey Police Department. Killam said the one patrol car will begin using a camera starting June 3rd which sounds like Monday, two days ago. Well, the other two hitting the road shortly thereafter, the cost is about 7 grand per unit and the police department funded the purchase of the three cameras with help from a law enforcement block ran of about 21 grand. The thermal cameras detect the infrared energy that all objects emit and can see things just as well during the day or night. Just like kind of like Clark Kent. You know something? You didn't miss that last night, did you? Very upset. It was pretty good. Was it? Which one was it? Invisible man and visible woman whatever it was. Somebody found some goop you put it on you it turns you invisible. Really? No I didn't see it. Something happened that I didn't see the ending. I forgot all about it. I was in Berlin in a hockey game last night and I forgot all about it. Anyway, such a tool is many law enforcement and safety uses in Davia, a role community within the forelaw of what papers is in, obviously not local. It's who knows, FCW.com. It says for instance, in the police officers and finding people are hiding or blocked from view in foliage, and officers also can use the camera and high speed pursuits at night because they generated by the vehicle's engine. The camera also can detect potential hotspots where a fire could start, thus preventing a catastrophe and catastrophe. The camera will pick up images that the naked eye cannot see, Killam said, for instance, if a man were to be hiding in the bushes and the camera was directed toward his body, the camera would pick up the image and project a glow on the screen during the heat generated from his body. It didn't see a small deal last night and I'm very upset about it. Oh, it was a pretty good hockey game. The not-staff until 430 this morning to watch the USB Portugal in the Osaka game because I don't care about it. I don't care which country is playing. I don't care of a craft. It's boring. It's terminal and not going to get sucked up on all of that hype. Just like to me, it's exactly the same as that garbage about the, you know, the figure skating in Olympics. Same thing. There isn't one person in this audience who's got their head on stream whenever watch figure skating, and yet when your Olympics was on, oh my gosh, did you see this? They got ripped off and the Russian guy's got, you know. Stop being so malleable, stop being such a whim, stop being such a bunch of, uh, lemmings of nebishes being let around by the nose, whatever the government, whatever the media tells you you're supposed to get all excited about, you can all whip up to a frenzy about it. Stop already enough. Look at that, now one call ring on the board, now we're getting, thank you very much. I appreciate that. 345 votes on a poll, which in these do you, uh, five hour, you most interested? Do we have one woman called today? No. No, did not have one woman. Is that sad or what? I'm going away until October the, about the 14th or whatever October. Nothing I won't be on here, but I won't be here. And there's not one woman in this audience who cares enough to send her very even her mediocorist, forget about her very best, her very breast. That's, that's, that's the same. No change, same old crap. Disgusting, nauseating, cold, hateful, hostile, WQAM. Hi, I'm so angry with anybody called in yesterday when Neil was talking about the mob boss that you to walk around town in this robe. No, they never got told us who it was. I know that is, I was wondering if Neil's still wondering, no, no, no, no. Yeah, what's his name? That's Vincent, uh, Chicagoanthee. Right. His nickname was the Chin. They need the Chin. They need the Chin, you know, he was just putting jail a couple years ago. Yeah, something on A and E about that. Yeah, he's like the last of the old school bosses to get put away. Okay, thanks a lot, pal. All right. They need the Chin. Yeah, I'm just saw that just done with a bill Curtis, which I used to like bill Curtis until he became such a legend in his own mind. If you know what I mean, what's fat boy doing there? Is that fat boy I saw wandering over there in the course? Who's like a propping with self up against the wall? Five, six, seven. Oh, that's right.

Don't forget go to Treasure Island this afternoon. You might get lucky, you're out. Squared, square, whatever. Okay. Maybe Book of Brian, let you wear his so that nice hair piece that he's got. You know, even though we have crappy prizes occasionally, like the Budweiser people are treasure island themselves comes up with some t-shirts when they can. Yeah. So it's always worth it. Well, I tell you what they want. What's we got our fax machine working here? The fact is started pouring into a plot where it's like almost enough to drive you nuts. When you shop for quality, footwear, selection and professional service are important to everybody with feet. But the bottom line of course is price. That's what separates the men from the goiom. At brand issues you find the biggest selection of men's and women choose the best service anywhere in town and the best price in the universe period. Top quality names were not the word where we're talking about like rock ports, S.A.S. Spirory, Timberland naturalizer and lots more. And with their big fat selection chances are you're never going to hear, sorry. We don't have that style in your size. They'll fit you up with exactly what you're looking for right there on the spot. And you'll find Brandeys at 1290 North Federal Highway in Pablo Beach. They're open daily 9 to 9 Sundays 10 to 5. So when it comes to selection and price, this is the place you want to be fitting up your feet. And all this week at Brandeys is the right tag. Yes it is. It's a stir-wide clearance sale going on right now. And I speak great savings and all famous brands. Look for the red labels only this week. Hey honey, got money for you.

Hand job, hand job, hand job, hand job. That man gets me in job, oh. Yeah. 1145 at 560 WQAM. Here's a facts from Richard and Coral Springs. It says it's a tiff me all these years to realize that you are absolutely correct sir when you say that people in South Florida absolutely know clue or care about hockey. While I must care a little bit because 76 out of our 100 out of 352 what percent is that 21 and a half percent. So they care about it they just don't understand it. As an e-trader who's proud of the fact that he grew up at hockey town with the right wings I've been a season ticket owner of the path is for years not only do people not know what's going on with games but I'm flustered and finally frustrated to try to talk to neighbors co-workers and the like about hockey itself. Here we are in a Stanley Cup finals and it's sad not to be able to discuss the wings with the NHL with anyone. The NHL appears not to even be a factor here and you are. Absolutely correct sir. There's no excuse for the retards here when it comes to lack of knowledge on anything in sports other than to know which Cuban ball players have defected to the US. Is that difficult for people to support sports in his fly by night town? hockey's perhaps the single most wonderful sport in the world but these people are seemingly wouldn't know hockey from their collective but holes. It's a see this guy's extra upset because his team got the beat last night. Sorry about that the dick I'm not for Caroline anyway I'm kind of neutral. Hey Carolina after they squeaked by my beliefs with some greasy wins in there overtime not too happy about that. It's a sad commentary on South Florida when people are so ignorant not to care about anything else other than what's happening in Cuba or how to make up noxious remarks to anyone others who disagree with them. God how I hated here. I do profusely apologize to you for not believing in you sooner right Richard and Carl Springs. Well there you go Richard get on a bus and get out of here baby it's all I can tell you. This place blows to the end of the universe it's the aint as you can smell it. You can actually open up your window and smell it. Smell a creeping death but have a nice weekend in paradise everybody. Oh god. Why does he say that? Stupid. That's he Todd and Hollywood facts is me about the honk if you want to free Jeff sticker holding up traffic etc. I'm sure in the street by your house did you see those? No. Oh. Well I'm glad you missed him. We don't need to be putting out any Jeff stickers okay in fact the Democratic Party is just going to advocate they're going to concede the next election. We're going down it's got a great calm in the New York Times as usual and as always she has a warden here which I'm really not sure how you pronounce. This is the second facts that I got the first one didn't come over right so I didn't read it because it was a paragraph sentence I was screwed up. So thank you whoever sent me the second one. Marine dab in the New York Times rights. I feel better now because now I know that when the pressure was on when lives around the line the CIA and FBI can pick up intelligence to annihilate the enemy. The only problem is their enemy is each other. The two counterterrorism agencies separated by the Potomacant devote themselves entirely to homeland defense they're too busy ripping each other apart leak for leak in their own homeland civil war. President Bush went to the National Security Agency in Maryland yesterday a place so secret it is known as no such agency and tried to reassure Americans that he was on top of things. In terms of whether or not the FBI and the CIA were communicating properly you said I think it is clear that they weren't and now we've addressed that issue. Oh really? George 10th of CIA director and Bob Mueller of the FBI have come into the Oval Office and promised to play nicely together in the spy school yard. Meanwhile however their subordinates are lobbying cherry bombs at each other in the press. The CIA FBI rivalry known as the wedge began when Jayad Gerohover the cross-dressing turf Nazi tried to fight off attempts to create the CIA a new agency of super spies out of the World War II OSS. As Mark Reedling author of the wedge secret war between the FBI and CIA has written the division of labor and deforendendomestic intelligence was never workable since spies, cross borders. Richard Helms the former director of the CIA compared it to cutting a man down the middle. There was also a culture clash between a proletarian meeting Patena's gum shoes from Forty-Minotor Dam in the worldly wasps of Langley who sat around a Georgetown dinner parties with pictures of martes talking art and plotting the overthrow of inconvenient third world potentates. Nowadays these stereotypes have faded since the CIA is full of cautious desktocies whose idea of globe-protting is jumping into the SUV for run to target. The cliché is now finally flipped at the top. Mr. Tenet was born in Queens the son of Greek immigrants and Roberts won Miller the turret Princeton 66 is so ivy that his agents mockingly refer to him as Bobby three sticks. At first and after the terrorist breeze through our thirty billion dollar year intelligence system on 911 both agencies felt vulnerable. So in an unprecedented spasm of cooperation to kept each other's missteps to themselves. But there here's the word I don't uh I know what it means, politics, pollpalitis. Okay, I don't know like a Frenchian other their politeness was by the one rival in King Total War. If you have more in I love her but she always has to use one word in there's we have to look up to source where stupid. In the fact of the matter is we admit it okay we are stupid. The FBI was pounded over the Phoenix memo then came to bombshell memo by the FBI special agent Colleen Rowney accusing Mr. Mueller and others in headquarters of circling the wagons after 911. Finally the FBI got tired of being battered in sick of Mr. Tenet's coziness with a president and decided to spread around the blame. Its fingerprints were clearly all over this week's newsweek which had the cover line, the 911 terrorist the CIA should have caught. The reports said that in early 2000 in Malaysia the CIA had been tracking two of the terrorists to a later flying to the Pentagon but didn't notify the FBI or the INS about the men who would then come to California using their real names and listing themselves in the phone book. The FBI prepared a detailed chart where somehow found the hands of Newsweek's Michael Isakov showing how it could have uncovered the 911 plot of it known about the hijackers sooner. The CIA struck back Monday telling reporters that it briefed two FBI officials on one of the men meeting in Kuala Lumpur and that the CIA had the email to prove it. The FBI some senators noted Dryle Yesterney had time to wiretap an Orleans brothel for 13 months with 10 agents. So Congress points fingers at the CIA and the FBI and the CIA and the FBI points fingers at each other. And hoping to distract attention from their own flaws the agents point fingers had been lot of beenlawed in the sociator they say was a 911 mastermind and large in Pakistan or someplace else. He's already on the FBI most wanted list so now he must be on the most desperately wanted list and al Qaeda laughs. Right some marine dot and herald and the uh herald my ass nearer times today. Yeah we're doing it baby. Wave those flags. You wanna say you wanna say baby we're doing it. We're on top of it. Do we have any idea where any of these bastards are? No no. And how about that article I read a few days ago about the business out they got them like in a country club down there at Gitmo because they're afraid of the you know all the amissie or national people and all the other finger porters so they're down there like you know probably feeding them shatah brionne though if that's on their diet. 359 votes on a poll today pretty heavy duty response which these are the most interested in.

He has often and effectively argued before the court Just as San Rudeo Conorrastal some other the voucher program makes any effort to make sure that the money that ends up in the Perocule schools is not used for religious training No Olson said but he quickly added that the government is not putting its thumb on the scales and favor of religion Because the parents make a genuinely independent private choice And I've been arguing for the other side that day I would have shown the court this during advice of the two parents who want to use vouchers from a Lutheran school in Cleveland It is highly inconsistent for any parents to send a child to this school if they are not living a Christian life or willing to learn how to lead such a life And are not supporting part of a congregation through worship and sharing of time and talents Jews Muslims atheist and agnostic need not apply to this school however genuinely independent their choice to send their kids with public money to a religious school I have the mission statements of other schools in the Cleveland program and you can decide for yourself a public money going to these schools advances religion and entangles the state with religion The state Rocco school handbook says that education there was designed to make faith become living conscious and active through the light of instruction and that religious truths and values permeate the whole atmosphere of the school The state John nodding him Lutheran school handbook states that the one cardinal objective of education to which all of his point is to develop devotion to God about our creator redeemer and sanctifier The cavalry center of academy handbook requires students to pledge allegiance to the Christian flag I even know there was a Christian flag did you know when you do now Or maybe that's just what they call him or I don't know the cavalry center academy handbook requires students to pledge allegiance to the Christian flag And to the savior for whose kingdom it stands one savior crucified risen and coming again with life and liberty for all who believe in other words that's our guest that's their pledge of allegiance Not only are there three not only are there daily religious classes in those schools, but as the six circuit cut of appeal said in the clearing the Cleveland voucher program unconsetutional These religious schools interweave Christian doctrines with science and language arts classes requiring that all learning takes place in an atmosphere of religious ideals Sir Rudy Giuliani tried mindly to force about your program in New York City became I'm against a New York case committee for public education versus Nyquist 1973 which until now has been into the United States Supreme Court the main ball work against using public money for religious instruction religious schools no matter whether the funds go directly or indirectly to those schools The vote in Zumb in versus Simon Harris will all likely have be five to four with San Rudeo Connor deciding whether to tear down much of what remains of that wall separating church and state to be continued Rights to net hit off in the village voice today kind of chillin chillin kind of scary But that's your president that's this administration baby.

What does it mean? Hard Report is asked about these suppressed memo from Phoenix FBI agent Ken Williams warning about the possible al Qaeda members in ruled and flight schools and went askcroff knew about it All of these are relevant questions replied and obviously frustrated Senator Bobby Graham He sent it intelligence committee chairman one of Askcroff's usual allies Republican Senator Richard Shelby described the Phoenix memo as Explosive very relevant information that we will get into as our inquiry continues a clear signal that even Senator Republicans are ready to resist any stonewalling The Askcroff apparently learned of the Phoenix memo just days after September 11th and ever bothered to tell his boss is by itself enough For the White House to put him on ice But the scandal on Askcroff's watch is much deeper start with the fact that the agencies whose bureaucracy stumbled most spectacularly the FBI and the INS report directly to the attorney general true both were right with problems that predate the bush administration But Askcroff took off as promising to clean the stables and instead He presided over some of the most scandalous and deadly bureaucratic misjudgments in American history from last summer's active suppression of FBI investigations in Arizona and Minneapolis to those late fall student visas granted to the deceased hijackers In the immediate aftermath of 911 it was easy to blame red tape But increasingly Askcroff's basic judgment is the issue It was asked Croft to insist on unnamed Robert Mueller or Justice bureaucrat on the first president bush as the new director of the FBI It was asked Croft to keep the embarrassing news of agent William Sphenix memo from going to the president or to Congress It was asked Croft to in the autumn took the 911 investigation away from one U.S. attorney in the country with experience and success prosecuting Al Qaeda married to white New York and gave it to the same justice department that we now know had bungled earlier inquiries Senators are suddenly remembering that back in November was asked Croft who would have paired Deference to the sensibilities of the NRA refused to use the federal government's gun owner registry in his terrorism investigation The latest leak a 6,000 word letter to FBI director Mueller from Minneapolis FBI agent and council Colleen Rally published by Time magazine comes close to directly implicating as Croft and a cover up Rally charges Washington with consistently almost deliberately thwarting the Minneapolis FBI agents efforts to Investigate Zacharias, Missawi last summer what's more is agent Rally a 21 year veteran of the FBI After 911 the department adjusted circled the wagons to protect the FBI from embarrassment and relevant FBI officials from a scrutiny with the highest ranking officials lying to Congress The deepest scandal is that after September as Croft consistently misled both Congress and the public about the reforms needed to prevent another attack The attacks happened we were repeatedly told because the FBI and the CIA were hamstrung by liberal reformers back in the 70s What was needed said as Croft were sweeping new powers to spy to jail to interrogate What was needed as Croft told Congress as late as December 12 was enhanced information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement communities Not to mention what asked Croft described as his deliberate campaign of arrest and detention the incarceration without charges of over 1100 immigrants and he excoriated critics like Senator Patrick Lehi By then asked Croft to note for months what the rest of us and only now just finding out that the FBI and adjusted department needed not new powers But new brains It was not excessive restriction on wire tapping the cause justice to drop to ball on Musawi FBI headquarters according to the Rally memo simply refused to provide a warrant to seize the suspects hard drive A warrant perfectly legal under resisting laws It was not liberal reformers who refused to listen to Phoenix agent Ken Williams low-tech survey of flight schools It was not excessive restriction of intelligence agencies that let us cross justice department disregard specific warnings about al-Qaeda suicide flights in general And Musawi in particular from intelligence agencies in Europe and as late as August the Monday Oh, there's a good one Mondanities That which is Monday night. So there you go As late as August who wrote this Bruno Shapiro in the LA weekly hey, Chibro now is late as August the Mondanities of law enforcement might have made a difference on 11 a memo passed up the chain of command and welcome instead of buried A quiet deployment of air marshals more careful scrutiny of the quick and easy visas routine the granted to Saudis The one nation in the world most responsible for funding al-Qaeda and nurturing Islamic fundamentalism Ask Croft in the past to show no gift for personal resurrection so we may survive this crisis But at the moment he's in attorney general running the Department of Justice without the trusted Congress Without the trusted the White House or even the FBI agents in the field the anti-terrorism plan announces weak only deflects attention from that fundamental problem The real stories that the attorney general spent the months after 911 touting high tech Cook and dagger reforms the damage the bill of rights while covering up world class failures of leadership management and cognizance They might have made a real difference no wonder he's on the leash Right Spurunosha, Piro, there you go See while all that flag waving in pseudo patriots is we all got sucked into was going on for a few months in a bumper sticker And all the you know, they were able to do these things, but now that we're starting to find out the real truth Just like the scandal in the church same kind of thing what's the Skab breaks open and the pus starts oozing out The public starts asking to have her questions Here's that story about the goddy bust from the New York post By the way, it's 391 votes on a poll Which of these are the most interested in baseball 109?

I think he's going to go on a building now Make a few people and offer they can't refuse If you ask me Doug Montero writes in the New York Post today This is more of a New York State thing As far as the historic concert of the scandal Never less it fits right in The proposed state law requiring clerics to report changes The charges of sexual abuse to law enforcement Is on life support and extremely critical condition And a mental hospital otherwise known as the state capital The doctors we paid to operate on this crucial issue Can't agree on two different yet similar mandatory reporting bills And as a good chance and agreed upon proposal Won't even reach the Senate and Assembly Floors By June 20th when the session ends Each side blames the other each side lament its eventual death Yet no one seems gained to roll up their sleeves and resuscitate the proposal I think it's too important of a bill for fail to fail for lack of ability to find common ground Since state senators Steven Solan Who introduced a bill requiring complaints to be reported the state shall abuse hotline It would be a horrible failure to have the session end without passing legislation That I assume the governor will readily sign Assemblyman Jack Mac and any of Albany who introduced a version of requires clerics to Directly call their local de-Aze office as he's frustrated I don't know why there's still hang on all that hotline He said describing how the system is already burdened with thousands of household child abuse complaints every year Governor Patakis office which was active in negotiations did not return calls for comment Perhaps because other issues like redistricting or election are more important The US Conference of Catholic Bishop yesterday proposed a series of changes in the way churches handle future pre-sexy abuse allegations like calling the cops The bishops voting these proposals next week but critics don't have much faith in the Catholic hierarchy So the critical condition of the mandatory reporting bills add to that paranoia New York state is still behind the times compared to the rest of the country said Susan Jason and advocate for victims The reason is because of the cozy relationship between the politicians and church hierarchy which is entirely unhealthy for the welfare of children There you go See where we always get kind into believing just after 9.11 Well now all of this cover up of the past all these cozy relationships all that's gonna you know go by the boards Guess what Wrong whether it's the Catholic church scandal or whether it's you know the evil doers out there or all of this other crap They're all too firmly entrench man. It's just if it ever does change it's gonna take a long time and hopefully we'll still be here to see it Here's the facts from Bob who says unfortunately I attended a Christian elementary school Every school morning from the age of five to eleven. I was made to pledge allegiance to the Christian flag I never heard that before before that thing. I know It has taken me years to finally get all of their corrosive indoctrination out of my brain I'll never forgive the people around that school for brainwashing me by the way ex-precious John McLaughlin celebrated her their the show her shows 20th anniversary last week Bye bye, says Bob bye bye Now what was that under I can't find that? What bye bye bye bye. No, the McLaughlin thing. What is that under it? McLaughlin group. How are we but how are we spelling and see y'all Maybe we have like a miss spelling in here or something could be I don't see it in there. I think it's gone You'll have to dittle around to see if I I know we are played it out of here how to how can it be gone? How could that have disappeared? One of the most crucial and important things in a history of mankind. Well, and anyway, good luck your Bob Ladywavita. I love that line of users It's taken me years to finally get all of their corrosive indoctrination out of my brain and that's exactly what it is corrosive indoctrination well put Bob You are Right on it Disappeared out there didn't it it must have well how's that possible? I remember putting it in there Yeah, and I remember playing it out of there. It's unlawster's best out for what it's worth I'm not the I don't have a great pressing need to play that right now. We have better stuff to play I mean we we could you know you spent a lot of time you're looking that up But we got the important things to play like Jesus Christ right stuff like that And we are pizorites in today's New York post defenses. Oh, and by the way speaking of court stories I meant to mention this before you know this sandy ego what that was their name The seven year old girl that was murdered Really?

She calls her anxiety a premonition More likely she could just no longer ignore what no one else in a circle of friends cared to see the people came into the apartment There seemed to be a shift last year Barbara told me yesterday in tears There were these were more hip hop kind of people different from the professionals She dealt with in the music run a timon industry hip hop kind of people Gangsters. I clearly told her I don't feel safe and we talked about it She said I was probably being paranoid because Jennifer trusted people Coleman a 44-year-old theatrical agent is one of Jennifer's loyal girlfriends who attend the trial regularly They're women on either side of 40 who worked in and around showbees most of the adult lives So have tasted success or still believe it's coming musicians dancers on conventional types They gathered in Jennifer's place above the deli record music or just talk and yes Smoked a pot that Jennifer supplemented her income by selling George Hip hop wannabe Sean Sally one of two men charged with the murders before it Calacly the Jennifer in a tape conversation as a hippie hippie the Sally that means week Yesterday Rosemond Dane testified in crushing detail about watching her boyfriend Charles hell Well a hell a well die on the floor the apartment a bullet piercing his head She would have died too as he not jerked her head at the last second But under crossing examination defense lawyer Andrew Katz sounded a strangely accusatory tone Asking her why she came to New York whether she smoked pot and whether she'd had a drink Outside Barbara was adamant it could have been me no one asks to die like this right's Andrea Pyser Today's New York post how do you like that?

Oh, yeah Ruby Keeler and Willie Keeler. It's all the same the got some his Bacho Cardinal William Keeler said it was considering asking in the Vatican to defrock that priest who was shot by a man who claimed the priest that abused the me years earlier Remember that story from a few weeks. Yeah, certainly do The announcement yesterday came as Keeler publicly urged the US conference of bishops to an up a zero tolerance policy For priest to face substantial claims of child sex abuse, but as we know now of course They say well you get to dittal once in the past you can abuse one kid net will look the other way The conference of bishops will vote next week on a proposed new policy under the proposal. Pray while we know that Don T Stokes 26 told police he shot the Reverend Maurice J. Blackwell three times. I made 13 Because he'd been abused by Blackwell years earlier Blackwell was removed from the pulpit in 1998 with another alleged victim came forward But he remains a priest the frocking would formally push blackwell out of the priesthood He or met last week with Stokes and said he apologized him for the paniest suffered He also told Stokes he would try to enact the new policy at the bishops conference in Dallas. He's zero tolerance Say first of all to show you the arrogance of these Assholes with their silly outfits The idea that they they should be having a policy of any tolerance is not their call to make it's the law You asshole who the hell are you people to get together and start like making up your own goddamn laws Somebody violates a law like that a civil law you call the authorities you turn their asses over and you let them prosecute. That's the way it works As opposed to well if you only screwed around with one kid in the past, of course We got to find out if it was in the rectum or you're in the rectum you know all whatever We'll we'll look the other way on that we'll give you like a get out of jail free card Without the $200 pretty sad 420 oh changing again 423 votes on a pool which of these are you most interested in? Reasonable to this poll today is because last night or the early this morning our time US upset Portugal in the World Cup in soccer three to two and some people I made a big to do about that And it's amazing to me just like with the marlins it's the same thing on a station I realize that we aren't anywhere near football season yet and is not much going on that anybody cares about in sports but But the fact is that at a time when we had the first game of the Stanley Cup finals in Detroit in hockey town last night and with a gigantic overtime upset by the Huracouans three to two with Ron Francis scoring a winning goal in overtime and a time when something like that is going on This station all I can talk about is soccer nobody cares about soccer. I told you that Except from people have just got off the banana boat and countries where they do care about it, which is most of the rest of the world, but that's still ain't here I mean and I asked a question which of these are you most interested in? I don't care about any of them. 118 baseball one 15 hockey 91 soccer 45 45 10 percent Cockfights 32 even cockfights was almost the outpacing soccer Now I got this because soccer is so boring how about if they had cockfights in it during the soccer games like on a sidelines would be good Huh or in between what do they have period half?
