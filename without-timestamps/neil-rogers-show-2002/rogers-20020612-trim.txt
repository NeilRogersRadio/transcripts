Calm down, Diane, and I know 2 at 5.60. Speaking of Diane, anybody see passions? Oh, that's right. You see it a day later. So, I'll tell you the discover that even the priest on that shows a little pervert, even when he's blind, he manages to find Miguel and like give him a little squeeze here and squeeze there and then squeeze his hand real tight. But anyway, I just noticed that. Our poor yesterday and this one hit one thing, I think this could be bigger than God damn sliced bread, you know what? I like it. I like it too. We had 915 votes, which is quite a few considering that the see we didn't do this right yesterday, but it was the first time out of the box. Out of the gate. And to do it right, you have to like balance it out from the different areas if you catch my drift and we didn't do that. Although I do notice that many of these are from the 80s, which I didn't realize that I won't disc. Like a Harold Falker-Mire, Axel F, which is Robert's favorite. And Godly and cream and cry and paw hard castle in 19. I always get the one. Oh, the divine rules and I touch myself, which would play that yesterday. A little bit. Anyway, the results of our pull very disturbing a George who's really pissed off and doesn't want to believe it for a second. But the good news is for you, because we're closing in our right now. So as I make a copy of it, that's it. And I just did. Which of these one hit wonders was the best? Soft cell by Tainted Love wins in a landslide. You don't believe that, damn. Nope. Well, I do. Just to be contrary, I do. 128 votes more than second, more than double the number 2 a song. I mean, it loves soft cell. Of course, the fact that I played bits of it about 100 times, that might have had some influence, but I doubt it. George thinks it was the the the a pole scores that the messed it up. I don't think so. I think it's a very popular song. Like, alright. I didn't say it. It's good. But I miss this to be queen in mountain. I mean, mountain and miss this to be queen, 61. Have that here, eventually. Norman Greenbom's fair to the sky. Oh, 60. Blues image, ride captain ride had 55 and rounding out our top five. These five will survive for the next pool. I'm not the next pool, but I mean, like the final runoff. Already, when we wind up with the final winners in about what was that going to be? About two and a half years. Steam, non-ahe-hey, kiss and goodbye. Number five with 49 votes. Just edging out taco and putting on the Ritz 45, which George was very nervous that that might make the cut. Didn't do it. Wow. Zagarin Evans in the year 2525 have 44. E.M.F. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. 38. Followed by. I'm not going to waste my time reading the numbers. Pay per list on Etchicago die, then free all right. Now, Johnson Vachton, welcome back, Carter. 30. Question mark of the Mr. and 96 years had 29. It should have been better than that. The proclaimers, I'm going to be 500 miles 27. Amboy duke's during the center of the mind. Shadows and I glory of monotones, book a love, David Essex, rock on, strawberry alarm clock, incense and peppermots, which is certainly no soft-saltated love. Freedom pain band of gold, Charlie Pride, Kissah. Angel Good Morning. We five you were on my mind, the five stair steps in U-child. The mystics in Hushie by Hen only 15 votes. Do you know something that's down right on American? Yeah. See, we had more people in South Florida who spoke English. The mystics in Hushie by would have had more votes. Sure, one of the specs. Yeah, blame the specs for that. Well, I must have voted for Tainted Love. Sure, that's a spicca group. Yeah. Medicine, lighthouse, love goes where my rosemary goes. And you ought to see what else is going there too. 11, shocking blue, Venus 11. And guess what had 10, finally? I'll be sure to cut out the sirens because of my radio, I'm scared. I'll think they'll watch them see. Who's the lyrids? What? They had only 10 votes tied with marmalade and reflections of my life, which also had only 10. That's, you know, like I said, what's the point? But it kills some good time. Electric prunes I had too much to dream last night had eight. A live and kicking tighter and tighter had seven. And guess what? What? They went out and bought some CDs yesterday. And guess how much they were, Robert? 999. Peace. That's Canadian for like for six and a half bucks. You get some of these great old ACGs. Six and a half bucks. That's some great stuff on these. As you heard before the show, get your little preview, not for chart. 898.6 was next. Fred and lover reach out in the darkness. White planes my baby loves loving finally had six. We finally got the title right and it had six points, which? It's something. Not great. Randy the rainbow is Denise five. And human beings nobody but me came in dead last with only three votes. That again. Very disturbing. In fact, I dare say sitting here in my goddamn chair with my fat ass that nobody but me but human beings is heads and shoulders above, tainted love by a soft cell. And he did it. We just turned it list upside down. Yeah, there you go. So there we got the top five. I'm going to put that over there. Save it. And then we'll compile a one from today in between and be quicks. Plus I have a lot of stuff to play. For example, and here just to show you that I'm not playing favorites. Here's one of the worst songs ever that I hate like poison. That could be the worst song of all time. You know what? In a summertime by mungo during come on now. Do you like that song? I'd use to. I mean, they would. I hear you don't like that song. I had song below. It's a piece of rap singing along. Sounds like something. It sounds like he's sitting on the throne. I just like saying mung. What about Neanderthalman by hot legs? And I tell you one thing for a song that quite frankly, if I never heard it again, it would be too soon. This is on every CD that was ever made, I think. I don't know. Bobby's freaking blue one on this CD. They got the panel right. The other CD had just said mine key going. This one. Mine key goes back. Okay, now it's a compiler list. And we've got to start right now. You want to know why? Why? I did a very stupid thing. What I did was mark these CDs. The yellow magic marker that I used to mark the log, the live spots, the highlighter, the highlighter. Well, what I did is I highlighted on the back of each CD because I didn't know how us to mark them. And now I noticed that the. It's rubbing off. Stupid. Yeah, I am. So in the summertime by mungo Jerry, we'll put that on there just to make you happy. You're writing me down? I am now. I'm not putting hot legs in the end of the whole man. I know it's a piece of crap. But I did look these up to verify them. We already did in the end. I want to be did was my Tico Bay on the list. No. No. Montico Bay by Bobby Bloom. Those are the only two from this particular CD. All I will say this because everybody wants it. We'll want to hear a little bit of this. Hey. It's money here a little bit of that. It's a play the whole thing. That's enough. It's Melanie with the Edwin Hawkins singers. Remember them from all happy day, remember them? No. You don't remember all that day. Yeah, it's a good thing. We're a communist man. You ought to be one of those assholes marching in Cuba today. We'll send many people to come in and make them an offer. They couldn't refuse and say good after in March. And show that he's your W. And you love Fidel. He promised them. Oh, did you just step by now? I never did. I was going to take her brand new key and stick her right in your. You know, watch it. So I just thought I'd play a little bit of that. Okay, so you got to start to list. Plus the ones that I gave you yesterday, which I guess you'll read back eventually when we get to it. But first let me do this. Because I, it's going to be one of those kind of shows. Got an OJ story today. Oh, a lot of good stuff. See, this is like a little bit better. You know, I like the tone of this a little bit better, especially with the music. Because it, it lightens things up a little bit. And supposed to all these very heavy depressing neurotic stories. Isn't that a were a fact talk about depressing and neurotic? Yeah. Yeah, right. This is from USA today today. Thread of dirty bombs off and ask crops remarks annoy White House. There should be a period in that. Thread of dirty bombs off and ask crops remarks annoy the White House. Attorney General John asked croft on Monday overstated the potential threat posed by a dirty to bomb suspect Abdullah Al-Mohajir, Bush administration and law enforcement officials say yesterday. What did I tell you? Trying to cover his ugly right wing ass. Ask crops remarks annoyed the White House and led the administration to soften the government's descriptions of the alleged plot. I don't think there was actually a plot beyond some fairly loose talk, and Al-Mohajir is coming here and here obviously to plan further deeds, deputed defense secretary Paul Wolfe which told CBS yesterday. His comments echo those Monday of FBI director Robert Mueller and deputy attorney General Larry Thompson. They backed away from ask crops description of the alleged plot, and the fact that Al-Mohajir was dangerous and that his arrest was a victory against terrorism. When ask croft announced Al-Mohajir's may 8th arrest, he said authorities had disrupted an unfolding, terrorist plot to attack the US by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb. His 14-per-ref statement mentioned radiation or dirty bombs five times, and said Al-Mohajir was being detained by the military for the safety of all Americans. A little bit melodramatic there, John. Ask croft's ominous tone surprised the White House and law enforcement officials here in a broad, including some who had tracked Al-Mohajir to Al-Qaeda meetings in Pakistan, the law enforcement officials say the evidence against Al-Mohajir 31, indicating he was interested in many scenarios, including involving explosives, and radioactive materials was one possibility. They say that the former Chicago gang member, once known as Jose Padillo, former Brewer County resident, was up to no good but that any plans involving radiation were not as mature as asked croft suggested. Administration sources say the White House infatibly told asked croft that it was this satisfied with this description of the alleged plot. How do you like that, huh? Publicly the White House defended asked croft saying he was technically correct. There's always a tendency at times like this that the initial reports immediately lured to the worst case scenario Administration's folks' minery, a fly sure said, Justice Department spokesman Mark Corralo and said Al-Mohajir was definitely planning an attack, asked croft was traveling in a hungry on Tuesday, in other words he's from hunger. How do you like that, huh? What did I tell you? On a heel of all a heat that they're taken, on the heels of all this bull crap, making an obvious that they have a good right hand, has got no idea what's left hand zoone and the fact that he wanted to continue spending a lot more money fighting drugs than the war on Terra. There you go. Ask croft, try to cover his obnoxious ass and he is. In fact, he's like a walking ass, you know what? Try to ask croft. Correct him. 913 at 560 WQM your home of ass.

Okay, we don't want to turn back we want to move ahead So I guess we'll have to put on some of the ones that I played a little bit so I also didn't even realize on this this the one I wonder described got that they were that recent because we got a balance this out that's what I'm trying to do today So I have some older stuff on here and also some 80s and 90s stuff So you punks on your little punks out there. There wouldn't know real music if it bit you on the ass I will have something that you at least recognize For example Robert's favorite Axel F Harold Fulter my I put that on you now.

Oh, us 3. I thought it was US 3. It's like in in in excess. First time I'm on say to when I read a poem. What's the point about in excess? I read inks. And they thought it was cute. But I expect from an old guy like me. I mean, I'm even older than kids. Kirby, who thinks he's programming the young people. So what do you think about that? But what Griffin thing, huh? What's to think? I don't know. I think she's pretty old. I think the act was old is what they meant to say. I see. Well, darling. 69 boys. Tootsie roll. Never heard of it. I'm a little old.

That'll get some votes. Oh, then I dick. A bigger pardon. Can we say that? No. Did I dick in New Age girl? Bring any bills for you? No. Am I writing a down? No. Well, don't just pour it right in there. No, because there are too many of them. I'm relying on some knowledge there. I mean, this is 1994, five. I don't know anything about the American music from those years. If we're doing like European music, I know a little bit. Like real music. Um, Edwin Collins, a girl like you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What?

This will be on here. Right? Yeah. The fourth spiral staircase, more than eight, than yesterday. I don't remember, but eight. I was okay. It was one of those after you heard it about the four-time that we said. It was pretty good, but I don't want to hear it anymore. You know? Right. It was pretty good, but the three or four times that was enough. And this will be on here. Smith. Far darker, complexed focus. SMIFF, Smith. My girlfriend, baby, is you? Yeah. I'm the way you snap out. See, maybe step out. You did. You didn't step on it. Very close, very tight. Let's have a replay. Just a replay. If they can do it in the NBA, we can do it on the heroine show. Instantly play for Stepan on Song. How about the flying machine? Do I have a little idea, as my friends? You'll see my little y'all circles. Cody, get a sharpie. Man, even an Iowa, there's not corn like this. If flying machine is my little smile for me, there's special. Lo's Marie. What about your name? Or are they? You really should accept me. Got us? Time needs to go for good. Got us? It's just my little smile for me, or there's something in parenthesis. That's all you need. That's the name. And just to prove we don't play only stuff we like. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Hopefully. Are we crazy, John there? Tracy, where'd I with you? Something new to you? That's as if all the sea live in Tracy, day after two. When you're the spray. Okay. And just in case you missed the yesterday, and I think it did, it made the number two as a matter of fact. A distant number two to a table of light by soft cell. But mountain, this is a big queen. I was going to swim with the good little scabbler. Just a joke. I think it was a good cup of garlic. I think it was a happy one. Oh no, you had that voicemail this morning about how he really died. Yeah. Still not how he used to do the gang bang with some guys. What is some terrible group sex? And he liked to watch his wife getting gang banged. Now he's dead. Feel as papillardy of Mrs. of a mountain. How about over the mountain by Johnny and Joe? But they had something else. That was a great song, remember that? Yep. Way before you were born. But it's after 10 at 5. 60 WMV. You noticed that all the good music was written before George was born. You think it's just a coincidence? Oh, no. Not before 64. Here's a simple question for you. Well, over the mountain was like in the 50s. Yeah, 64 was the Beatles and the Beach Boys. That was the end of all the good news. Let's start with the aerosmith. Here's a simple question for you. If somebody offered to give you several thousand dollars of the next few years, would you accept it? Of course you would. Don't be stupid. Which makes it really foolish to pass up an opportunity.

Yeah, I can't be kidding. Coming up tonight on Inside the Behind the True Hollywood Celebrity Music by Agrafe Profile Story. We take a good, hard, stiff look in the start-up. She made us laugh as only a decrepit incontinent old person saying something suggestive can. She was clearer and clearer. The old lady who said, where's the beef? What I liked was that where's the beef? Could be about a hamburger patty. But it could also be about a man's private parts. In tonight's archived view, Clara talks openly about the devil untonged or contained in the slogan. You know, where's the beef? Could be something you'd say about. A man's penis. Clearly, Clara was not unaware of how the phrase entered pop culture. You could be talking about his trousers, Snake. Yes, Clara Peller was as feisty as her unscreen persona. Could be a reference to his rod. Are you swinging a witty? His looser! His looser! Uh-huh. Yeah, okay, that's enough Clara. His little soldier! His bloop-sword! I guess, Steppy! His... wait! Did I see... ...a... That's my favorite one. Clara Peller. We had hoped she would shout at the stereotype of the elderly as Hornie half seen how not jobs. But, well, what are you gonna do? It's a big... juicy, stopping with look at show business tonight on Inside the Behind. So where is the beef when you come right down to it? Clara, ten eighteen, course you still did. That's a bad part for Clara. So good facts is here, something in the air by Thunderclap Newman, you are... Absolutely correct. And how many times have I played that on here and tried to pedal that to the South Lower Audiences? Well, we'll put it on there, Thunderclap Newman's something in the air, but they don't like it. Don't ask me why. Maybe it's just too good. Here's when who says, love the no-call format. And I'm glad you mentioned that because last week when I was down there for those three days, I want to apologize for Monday if you Wednesday of last week, and George especially once to apologize for last Thursday when I was in transit back here to Toronto. Yeah. Oh. But I think it's good that we do that once in a while just to prove a point that the calls are so bad that they're like a show stopper or a show destroyer, they're like the end of the universe. Just to prove the point, not that we really have to. Anyway, when says, yesterday you mentioned the next stand a couple of games in Newtville Thursday, that's right, wrap it up to our night boys, hey, cut the crap. And by the way, Igor Larry on off of an asshole when he was in Florida playing for the... I say, playing for the Panthers when he was wearing the Panther uniform, which he never played a lick. Never exerted one ounce of effort. Now that he's back with a great team, all of a sudden the edge of 41 he's re-found is... is regained his youth. Makes me sick. Anyway, it says, that's because the F&MBA finals are Monday nights, so we don't have... They don't want to go up against that, so they had to push it back to the mall. As far as one hit wonders and here's when is absolutely correct. Turning Japanese by the vapors, he's right. I looked it up, of course. It was without saying. But Frank, who seems to have a problem in Frank every day, faxes some... Some incorrect information. He says, poor hard castle had hit with rain force in the mid 80s, so he doesn't qualify as the one hit wonder. Well, guess what Frank, rain force wasn't a hit, it didn't make Billboards top 40. For those that don't know, even as a greatest hit CD says, Frank, and guess what Frank, you're still wrong. How do you like that? Ha ha ha ha ha. So, I don't mess with our list. And Deb, Deb, he says, and she is correct. How could we figure out how could Georgia forgotten this? Yeah. And I could go back there in the TV themes and whip this right out and play it again. But I think I've already done that a little bit too much anyway. Believe it or not, theme from the... It's actually called the theme from the greatest American hero. Yeah, how could I have forgotten that? Joy Scarberry, a medley of his smash. Great song! Theme from the greatest American hero. We don't have to put believe it or not, because that's not really officially the name. Okay. Got it? Got it. So the list is growing and now... Awesome, both! See, it's amazing, because by these CDs, very, very cheap. Great CDs, best of kind of things. And yeah, I look them up in my book, and I find out for example, there's 12 cuts on this one, and two, four, five, seven. Or is it eight? Well, I can't see my eight, I guess. Eight out and twelve are like one hit one. I have the march. Yeah. That's how... The streets are in the front stand. I want you to hop inside my car. I got the things I got to carry on with the moment. And I could take what you've been given to start. I don't feel the pain there. I've got it. Yeah, I'll do all three save, I'll wait a second, so that's how it's done. I got the things I got to carry on with the hand. I'm going to link in you, and ready to stop. I'm going to save all babies, I'll drag into anything I want to do. I'm just going to get so close to one of them, and I'm going to make a soaps of news. I'm going to give them that soul. I'm going to grab your hat and a formula. I got the formula. I've got the power to mold it from the shore. Oh, you got you. Well, I have a way to get your own show. I just stationed out an alley wall. And I don't care if you're waiting for the Lord. I just was long as you could stroke me though. I'm on the same boat, baby. And you'll do everything I want to do to you. I'm your consultant, one bottle. Spank your nature and have desire you. I'm going to vote you. I'm going to vote you. Oh, you're a good doctor. I'm talking to real doctor. That's why I'm like insulting, because I'm just an ass. Oh, man. I'm talking to a lot of people. You know, we have many controversial people in a radio business. And you can ask, like 50 different people. Like you'd be a 50 different person of that person. Every single person I've ever mentioned, Walter Sabo's name is said the same thing. He's an asshole. Yeah. Every one of them. Even people he worked for said he's an asshole. So how do you like that? In fact, I think especially people who worked for stations he up the destroy. Anyway, you get that, uh, I did March. Yes, I did. And we had this on yesterday. Rod Kethon, right? Which did very well. But I figured so much about play a little bit of it. I played this earlier. Blue's image. Maybe this morning. It was number four. I played it before the show. Number four on yesterday. Number four on yesterday. Number three men. Down. From the San Francisco Bay. See, probably there's some punks out there thinking, well, you don't have to go out and buy all these suities. See these. You can download these for free and burn your own city. I could do that. But you know something you'll have much time that would take. So you can have downloading? Yes. From yesterday. Also, we have a guest. How about the house dog? Thank you, Bob. Brian. How did tornadoes? Yes. How was that? 61. You got this. 61 or two. I'm going to have to look that up. It had to have been 63 or four. No. No. No, because I was in Boston when I was a hit. All right.

Once there was this kid who had a little accident and had to one from school but we back. His friends gave him a name of stinky toys. He tried to make the John but you know he could in home. He was a little bit too old. Here's one of my favorite all-time songs but I'm not sure that this is the right group. That is quote was that the right group pictures of match the man. I'm going to go on and find that somewhere. If I have to scour this way. Is that sound like the right group? Sure. I haven't heard that in so long. But I'll just look it up in the book real quick here. And find a way to build board book other than the question mark being from Texas which they said which was wrong from Sagittal Michigan other than that billboard don't make mistakes Frank. So don't be dickin' with our thing. I've got nice instrumental music for you to look that up with. No, I got him right here. Status quote pictures of match the man. December 68. I played that on here in Kalamazoo Michigan. How do you like that? Are we right out? I like that. Yeah. Just checking. What do you plan classical gas? Yeah. Mason Williams. Well, I don't know. What do you mean you think they qualify? I can't remember any other hit thing out of that. Well, what do you mean thing? He. Well, you know Mason and William. I think you're wrong. Look it up. But I'll look it up. I'm looking at that right now as you speak as you're playing that. Here's Roger Williams on him. Lee's member Roger Williams on Cap Record. Yep. How about Mason Williams? Like I said that's the only hit he ever had. Classical gas was number two for two weeks. He did a two two in 1968. One of the outstanding instruments of all time. I've been hard times ago. Yeah. Side drop some of the elevator here yesterday's a matter of fact. People were scattering. Scat. How about. Ah. Speak it up in the middle. Oh, but before we play that. How about pictures of matchs.

They also had over 40 hits in both Germany and Holland where there were over 500 Dutch names of the members of the fan club. 5000. 5000 Dutch members of the status quo fan club. Next time you're in Holland, go to a record store and see how many albums they've got. And as somebody if they've been popular last to 30 years, they're in the one hit Wonder book. But whatever I can't read the bottom line, this is the come out of the facts. How do you like that? Huh? So that'll be another thing when I go to the 85,000 different record stores in Amsterdam.

I don't know what you're talking about gladly Not like I happily you are you're just such a little prick man. It's unbelievable sure I have All right Not gladly I an infected time I was volunteering there. I guess it's probably too late Probably but anyways I can have Robert right out there. No nobody comes in for a half an hour I mean just the driving alone where the hell does he live he lives in date County then I I don't know Not a few smart I know little dog lives in plantation. I don't know where managed gloves But anyway just to come in here the driving alone be more than a half hour to do on the air It makes no sense to me Marlon's on deck at one thirty tomorrow. It's a Kansas city where they got shot out five as a last night At 205 Hank will be on after the baseball He also should have a fairly short show till seven o'clock the big Land of Alzagiri at seven eddy K after him and then Jolmarco overnight to the six So that's a schedule and the effect that managed has to come in for half hour pains me greatly. How to phone it in Yeah, you can just place one hit wonders for a half hour. I could just play music for half hour and a guarantee And of course leading up to the Marlon's get a bigger number than the Marlon's right you bet make no mistake about that Oh, guess what I did for a dead Oh, because I'm such a nice guy President said you're good lord because the sun will shine sometime today or tomorrow sooner later And it's gonna get to 75 Joey Scarberry what now what is the history I don't know his story. I could never know I want to take a look at a football field as Calgary capital already here sports Oh Guess what Joey Scarberry was born 6755 and Ontario, California How do you like that?

Oh, I didn't know you wanted to it. What's your call? I'll play another baby Oh, that not one play that that's that's self-serving that's a George bit. Yeah. That's a book of writing to her dog. Oh So here's a facts from somebody like one out of four-hands bed A rest of development in Tennessee when the none out of four because the rest of development had a bunch of hits Did you know that yes People every day mr. Wendell and Tennessee but all three of which were top 10 so guess what? And they also got blister in the sun from the violin fems they had a lot of good songs But I think that was their only hit that well wasn't a top 40. It wasn't a 40-hit wow any commosie hot step or hot step or also didn't make it He he he from I'm crazy Well, I think you are crazy because so Thank you very much for your I bet you big Arnie being pressed with that list Here's one it says and another one it's wrong.

I'll speak on the LAPD This is in the globe this week not the Boston globe or not the globe and mail, but the the Tabloid the globe Angry OJ Simpson launched a furious attack on his murdered wife sister and sources say that the niece brown is now terrified Should become the victim live a victim like the cool. How do you like that? That's even like for anyway I don't like her either nobody does The disgraced athlete blasted her with such vehemence that Denise and advocate for bettered women feared for her safety say in Ciders According to a source the juices scared sister and law warned her family that OJ was out to get me just like he did in a coal But to find Denise put on a brave face by telling globe that she'll never back down from Simpson Let him come after me. She said in that exclusive interview He doesn't scare me. He never has come on Simpson. Give me your best shot. She says how do you like that? Got a good chance of words honey OJ went ballistic after Denise said in a newspaper interview that he should be investigated for illegal drug use She claims that files from a secret FBI probe into an international drug ring may prove that he's violated the terms for keeping custody of his children Sidney 16 and Justin 13 If the court in Orange County, California, which awarded him custody of the kids decides to look at the evidence Which contains allegations that Simpson took part in cocaine vanges and allowed on savory characters into his home It is possible that a judge could overturn the decision and return the children to their grandparents the Lou and Judith at Brown Say the sources they be saying The prospect of losing his kids all over again turn 54 year old Simpson into a raving mad man say pals That woman's life is worthless. He railed about Denise 44 Let me say it again that woman's life is worthless OJ railed about Denise 44 She lived in the shadow of her sister and she's too stupid to ever step out of it Denise hates me, but I'll make her pay he allegedly said. How do you like that? Friends say Simpson was furious with Denise because he believes his children are the shining lights of his life Of his otherwise scumbag life He told one pal despite everything they've been through their great kids in our proud of them They're both honor students and Justin's just been named as honor athlete of the year That's an an a classy private school with high standards The source confides at Simpson says Denise is more problems than he has and more do not to make them an issue Or she'd regret it adding I know she hates me, but my kids are off limits According to sources OJ claims that he was told by Sydney and Justin that Denise had major problems after they Spend an Easter vacation with the brown family at their day-to-point California home But Denise's father Lou Brown 78 defended his daughter telling a pal she has no problems She's a good person what's more she loves OJ's kids. No, sorry everybody's got pals Palette and everybody's palette's talk a lot Especially with the tabloids However, the source who were at Simpson ranning says I've never heard him so angry he was as livid with Denise I thought he was gonna explode One source who knows both Simpson and Denise tells the globe. I can't believe the way he's behaving toward her I thought he got away with murder. He should leave it at that now that OJ's living in Florida the biggest thing And Jesus favors the distance between them. She should keep as far away from him as possible The reports of Simpson's fury quickly reached the sister of his dead wife and she shuddered at the danger Although Simpson was peered in 1995 of killing Nicole and Ron Goldman on June 12, 94 he was later found liable for their brutal deaths By civil jury as we all know too well It's the second time that the ex football player sent shivers down Denise's spine with his threat say sources The first menacing words came at Simpson's welcome home party just hours after his acquittal and shocked even his own supporters Reveals Nicole's lesbian lover, Fay Reznik and her book shattered in the eye of the storm Nicole's lesbian lover? That's what facet The 43-year-old author who had a brief gay affair with Nicole Shirley before her murder and played a major part in the police investigation wrote that as he celebrated his freedom Simpson declared there are two people I'd like to kill Denise Brown and Fay Reznik Then he drew his fingers across his throat Oh, what a classy guy he is you know His anger was directed at Denise because she gave evidence in the criminal trial about Simpson's violent behavior Careful, is she recounted before the jury that eventually, what is it? He recounted before the jury that eventually equated Simpson how he threw in a cool against the wall and then tossed her out of their home. She also testified that he grabbed her crotch in public and called her a fat pig when she was pregnant. See, now we're starting to side with him a little bit more. Yeah. Low reported in 1996 that Simpson had frequently sworn to get even with Denise saying, I'll never forgive her in a fake resinic. They can go to hell. After all I did for her, she turned against me. I picked up her tab for years. I paid for her drugs, her clothes, and I said it to acting classes. She was jealous of the cold and was always coming on to me when her sister's back was turned. She wanted me to bed her, but I didn't. She's just white trash. Now the M&E between Simpson and Denise is in overdrive. The new upper-or- exploded afternoon east-graded interview to the Toledo Blade, which reported it in its exclusive story. She wants the court to decide whether the former football grade violated his custody agreement. The coldest big sister was quoted as saying, what really scares me is the court should be reading these reports and they aren't. The story went on, Ms. Brown, who travels the country giving speeches on domestic violence issues, told a blade last week that federal agents in Miami should turn over their files to the Orange County California Family Court that still lies jurisdiction in the custody case. It said the files gathered by the FBI during investigation into an international rug ring a smuggling the drug ecstasy contained drug dealer statements surveillance reports and wire-tap transcripts. Among the allegations are that Simpson allowed a drug dealer, Andrew Anderson to stay in his guest house, and babysit Sydney and Justin. The blades has Anderson 33 drove the children to and from school at the same time, he was involved in narcotics deals. He's pleaded guilty to selling her to see Simpson is denied being involved in any way with drugs or criminal activity. After a raid on his house in Kendall by investigators, no charges were level but it was later reported that he'd been tipped off ahead of time. Simpson's attorney Yale Kalantra tells the globe that after Denise's comments were printed, he called her in her parents and she denied giving any interview to the bleed-o blade. He added O.J. says as much as Denise hates me, she would never say this. For all the tension between them they're strong in their understanding that they'll not involve the children in any disputes. O.J. and the Browns are happy with the current custody situation and don't want to turn it in any way said Galanter. Despite Galantra's claims that he tells the globe that she did give the interview an ads, my first concern is for those kids my sisters children if there are drugs being used in Simpson's home. The court would jurisdiction over the children should be made aware of that. Now according to friends Simpson wants to slow down his life and concentrate on Sydney and Justin. O.J. lives every day knowing that he's lucky to be allowed to have them says the pal. That's why he gets so angry when somebody liked Denise threatens that. How do you like that, huh? I like it. And that if that isn't good enough, Nancy Sinatra's cyber-sex shocker. O.J. She's exchanging racie talkwood strangers in chatrooms. There's one for ya. He's bootstraint. Walk in, Nancy Sinatra?

And then she did, I think that was the only hit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's the name of that song that Brit Assel did? Could you never have that word? When the court kid me, you know, Browns are robbing what? Oh, we have that here somewhere. What? Then you go and run it by saying something stupid. Something stupid. That's what it's called. Something stupid. Oh, yeah, she had how does that grab you, Darlin? Sugar town? And a whole bunch of other crap. Mostly with the Lee Hazelwood and with Frank. Swanky Frankie. So she don't qualify.

The 62-year-old singer of the hit-tune these boots were made for walking is typing her flirty come on stemming visiting the chat room on www.sonatrafamily.com or family's famous website and the stuff she writes is red hot and definitely not for kids. In one message she says, I think I could find something very interesting in Freddy's pants pocket. Why do you just come on over here, Freddy? You're never too old to have a little fun. Besides I'll bet your lips still work. Puck her up, baby. Later on, she adds, oh, Freddy, every time I look at your picture, I'm more convinced we should get together. Maybe a cruise would do it. We wouldn't even have to leave our state room if he didn't want to. We could have all our meals in bed. Freddy honey, I'll meet you anywhere you say because I love how you make me laugh. I gave up sex for rent but for you I'd give up giving up sex. In another message she describes her in detail her new 1995 photo shoot for Playboy and makes a suggestive mark about a hot dog. I bet your Clara, how about your Clara Pellar B. uh, please? Nancy shocking cyber sex antics has her family terrified that the sizzling message will attract the sick O stalker who could hurt even kill the songbird inside his reveal.

Just a joke, I'm sure they did not call, nobody's taking me up on that offer. Try to be an ice guy. Try to crack that image of being a real hard ass prick, but you know that's way cause I made it an offer we could refuse I guess. Would you come into do a half hour? Would I? I mean, like if you were in the mad dog shoes, if you wanted to. I thought the hot shot with like a real contract or something. I'm sure is I wouldn't ask for the option. I'd laugh in there. PUS. Here's a simple question for if somebody offered to give you $7,000 over the next few years just handed over to you. Would you take it? Would you say, hey, hand it over? Yes, you would. It would be stupid not to do it. It makes it really foolish to pass up a chance to refinance or buy a home at only 3.95%. Here's the way it works. There's a fanty made program waiting for you 3.95% for both refinancing and purchasing of homes just 3.95%. And all you have to do is make one easy phone call to financial group and I'll explain it to you. Call 1-89-4053-63. That's 1-89-4053-63 to be more specific. You can get 100 grand with payments of only $175 or get $200 grand with payments of $950. You'll save yourself thousands and thousands of dollars. So be really downright foolish to pass up a chance like that. Do the math and do the smart thing. The next logical thing gets an entails by calling financial group at 1-89-405. That's 1-89-4053-63. There were an equal housing lender, credit restrictions, dual-pline like I always tell you, rates are subject to change if you wait. That's the rejoin. That was the fricard rejoin?

A woman who said she was molested 30 years ago as a first and second grader with saying anthony's. Saying anthony's Catholic school in Fort Lauderdale found a loss of yesterday seeking unspecified damages from the church and the Miami Arts Dicis. The man she's accusing Virgil M. Bollme died in 1998. He moved from Fort Lauderdale to Leesburg in 1985. The 37-year-old Howard woman who was not identified in Lauderdale said she didn't know if Bollme was employed by the Arts Dicis which oversees the Fort Lauderdale church. She thought Bollme was a Dican, but an Arts Dicis spokeswoman said the Dican program didn't begin until 1979. The woman said she saw the man a church every Sunday at church social events and in the school yard nearly every morning where she was to hang out with Paul Simon and Julio. In addition to him his wife lived behind her parents how she said that's not our Julio by the way. Can you imagine Paul Simon and Arholio back in the school yard? Why not? Don't be picking on Julio, okay? His name's written all over town here and he was only here for like two or three days. The woman said in the phone interview Tuesday that Bollme fondled her shoulder pornographic black and white pictures exposed himself to her and forced her to touch him beginning in 1970. She said the abuse occurred at school and at her home and didn't stop until her father got transferred and moved the family. She said she called Bollme the man at the back fence because he would call her any younger brother to the fence when they were playing or swimming in the backyard. He would expose himself and then give them candy until then they would get in trouble if they told anyone. Bollme's son Joseph Bollme 68 defended his father when he reached when he was reached at home in Greer South Carolina. He said his family had bushes in the backyard that would have made it difficult even to get to the fence. We had a thick hedge back there. He said it was six feet tall, three feet thick. I trimmed that thing for ten years and a hitch too. Joseph Bollme said his father was a loyal church go right in usher but didn't remember him being involved with the school. He might have smiled at the girl or wavebed her. He was nice to everybody. He had a salesman's personality. He liked to tell stories and all that but didn't molest children. I guess her object is to go after the deep pockets go after the church. How can she suit the church for stuff that happened like, uh, you know what I'm saying with a dead guy? I don't know. How do you prove that? I guess we'll have to dig him up. Well, see if he does have a thick push. He can't deny it. Here's more bad radio news by the way. It's just gets worse and worse and worse. Spanish language media giant univision communications is expected to announce as early as today that it is expanding its empire with a three and a half billion dollar acquisition of his panic broadcasting corp. The nation's largest Spanish language radio company sources close to the negotiations at yesterday. It would be the biggest merger in the history of US Spanish language media outstripping NBC's recent 2.7 billion dollar acquisition of highly evased telemode communications group which owns the second largest Spanish language TV network in the US. The deal represents the first 4-ray in the radio for the television which now has interest in Spanish language broadcast in cable TV, the internet and Latin music as well. Sources say the merger will strengthen the version of the positions as the top Spanish language media brand in the US and will allow it to cross promote its musical artist on air talent and programming on its widening array of media outlets and as well as offer one stop shopping to advertisers who want to reach the growing Hispanic market. With his fancens numbers now approaching 40 million more than 13% of the US population media companies in truth in the market is intensified. It will be a stock for stock deal sources set with 0.85 share of univision stock exchange for each air of NBC and a subject to both regulatory and shareholder approval. Sources say Hispanic broadcasts these two largest cheerholders, the Tickanoir family and chief channel communications have agreed to vote in favor of the acquisition as has a zero peri a parental chairman president chief executive officer of the division units controlling shareholder. Both the division and HBC declined to come out of the perspective merger last night although the division based in LA the operation sent efforts to TV networks is in Miami. The division has already got the top rated broadcasts Spanish language network, the new broadcast network telefutura, the top cable channel, the most popular internet uh what is it portal?univision.com the largest station group with 50 stations and the number one Latin recording label phonovisah under the university music group on brellon the US market. The deal brings it to a radio a- brings it. Huh? To make any sense. The deal brings it a radio hub powerhouse with 55 Spanish language radio stations and 40 of the top 20 Hispanic markets. By the way this isn't a hero that's why there's like hard to read stuff in here, Miss Prince. Including four Miami stations, a radio man v, WAKUIAM710, or that 790 like Tom Jika thinks, visit the other way around. WKBA AM1140, radio ritmo, WRTOMF98.3, and radio on more WAMR FM17.5 and a network of community focused bilingual websites, HBC owns more than half the top 25 rated Spanish language radio station The combination means for example that in LA the nation's largest Hispanic market, the university would have two TV stations for FM radio stations and one AM station. The pending deal comes at a time when some members of the TV industry are expressing concern about the impact of media consolidation on programming quality and diversity. As if we don't know the answer to that right? Right. Earlier this month the caucus for television producers writers and directors sent letter to FCC chairman Michael K Powell saying that while the new technologies increased the number of radio and TV channels available there's also been an alarming increased number of corporate entities which own and control these systems. HBC would become university's radio division sources said the radio company would remain in Dallas, top managers would remain, and McHenry Titchner Jr. the chairman president and CEO of Hispanic broadcasting would have the new university radio unit. In recent months the university has been solidifying its future as the dominant Spanish language media company in the US in December they reached the agreement with Mexico's Grupo Telavisa and then a Swaila's Venovision event that brought it to Telavisa's Los Angeles based music recording business for no visa and also give it to the exclusive US TV rights program produced by Telavisa and Venovision through 2017. I'd be like they just keep getting bigger and bigger and less and less competition and just a handful of companies own oligodam radio and TV. English, speak whatever whatever you name it and they own it. And we've already seen, we've already seen on the English language side the tremendous, yeah the tremendous benefits for those of us who work in a business and for you people the audience out there too. It's a disaster. But don't confuse the FCC with that because they don't give a crap. So long as they don't say those words they couldn't care less. Twenty-two noon at five, sixty. Oh look at that speaking of crap. The markets say every day it starts out a little with green arrows and then by this time it starts like and now yesterday it was up quite a way. Did you know is that? Yeah. And then by the end of the day. Wow it took a gigantic dump and a Nasdaq is 1488. 1488. I think pretty soon you can buy palm for like about two cents. In fact what's the one that's 18 cents? What's the one? What? There's one stock on it. One big that's on a vertical and out of business I forget which one it is. It's 18 cents. So just imagine for like 50 bucks you can go above a lot of that crap. You could have the company. Just right before they go belly up.

Well that facts came over just as here it says it's a very interesting story about OJ it supports my theory that this is part of an ongoing and intricate strategy because of complete mental breakdown in Simpson and approximately two years on the 10th anniversary of Ron and Nicole's murder by OJ. You know we would say on that day. Yeah we'd have a party. This will be followed by humiliating suicide or suicide attempt involving auto eroticus fixation cocaine overdose and even another murder by OJ this time of a business associate mafia which will of course bring about his swift death compliments of co-synosed roar Russian mafia in any OJ is being suddenly and carefully pushed to the point where I'll have to take action against misbrown and that is precisely the plan except that the entire scenario has been created and carefully worked out in order to destroy him mentally and finally physically millions have been spent on this effort thanks to the 333 and a dollar lawsuit and many committed individuals are great follow the only problem with that is that nobody ever got any money from that lawsuit isn't that correct okay but that's a fascinating. Speaking of that it's big and a suicide that fact you must have been psychic you want to know why got some a story you're going to be very upset about okay actor Christian Slater has revealed a dark secret five years ago his drug and booze addictions drove him to attempt suicide of course George is going to be upset because he failed damn it Slater now 32 says he was so humiliated following his 1997 arrest in the LA condo for beating up friends and attacking cops during a wild alcohol heroin and cocaine fueled rampage he tried to end it all by jumping off a balcony luckily luckily for him not for George who hates him like poison luckily friends pulled him back in time but that was just one of several times he tried to take his life my entire 20s were complete near misconfaces the actor who can be seen in the upcoming World War II flick win talkers it's a miracle I survived any of it really is a total miracle but Slater now happily married dad of two as far as he's gotten his act together I'm not the guy assaulting people I don't trick in driving he says I'm convinced I've discovered that I'm not really invincible so he tried to give it his best shot but unfortunately didn't get the job done and like I said George is fired up and pissed off got more on that Hillary thing remember that story the other day about the game drugs got some lengthy stuff on the star on that right after this one though is then Vol Turkey to go to show that the radio business isn't just screwed up in the west saying he was a threat to public order police dug up a Turkish radio DJ who was broadcasting live a mga reports at yesterday and if you think I'm really these names even close to right good luck to me in tombed in an air-rated metal box yes are a nasi kutsu was planning a 24-hour

Police commissioner says New York doesn't need armed bands as it citizens of protected neighborhoods, flatly rejecting a proposal by a Jewish group to begin patrols next week. The department will not tolerate anyone brandishing weapons under the guys of protecting others, commissioner Ray Kelly said the other day, anyone attempting to patrol the streets armed with weapons will be arrested. This is today's news day. On Sunday, Rabbi Yachav Lloyd, president of the right wing Jewish defense group, proposed armed patrols citing comments as suspected terrorists made on CBS's 60 minutes about targeting certain Jewish neighborhoods. Any movement in this direction is counterproductive, Kelly said, the tenor of this is wrong, we don't need this. In other words, you don't like the tone of it. Lloyd said the patrols would go ahead anyway, and it's fight of what he said, what the police commissioner does not understand is that no matter what he says, those who have the legal right to carry firearms can carry firearms, he said, and they're going to do it. Because that's the Jewish militant right wing away of doing it. How do you like the apples huh? Oh look at that market man. Oh God. See I probably shouldn't be looking at those numbers because people are still stuck in there and haven't gotten the sub-chinks in us. Yeah. Hey, well look, I mean, don't you think I've paid my dues? Don't you think I lost enough to like at least find a get something right? Maybe? Maybe. Wow. That was down 65 in the NASDAQs. I don't want to say it. Mind your own business. Okay, I'm not in it. This from CBS, the Senate yesterday dealt a major setback to a bill. It would make violent attacks based on victim's sexual orientation or disabilities, a federal hate crime refusing to debate on the measure. Opponents of the legislation stands no chance of passing the house is now written. The measure would add crimes motivated by gender, sexual orientation and disability, to the list of offenses already covered under 168 hate crimes law, that prohibits the tax based on race religion and national origin. The 54 to 43 vote derailed efforts to win a speedy vote on legislation and send it to the House, which has rejected it twice in recent years, while it takes only a simple majority to pass a bill, motions to end debate require 60 votes, backers of the bill fell 6 vote short. Only former Republicans voted to limit debate. Other Republicans said they refused to close off the debate because Democrats hadn't given them enough time to attempt to amend the bill. The legislation would allow federal prosecutors to pursue his hate crimes cases, and a assault upon a person or group because of sexual preferences or disabilities of state officials reject filing charges. The Republican controlled House will not take the bill as written by supporters and innocent or in snatch Republican of Utah. If you really want to do something about hate crimes, let's do it the right way and amend this bill so the House will be forced to take it said snatch, who wanted to scale the bill back to ensure the federal government doesn't interfere with state prosecutions. The bill supporters took it off the schedule before GOP senators could attack their amendments on to it. This is just the beginning and we're going to continue this battle throughout the session, said Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts added Senator Gordon Smith Republican of Oregon, we will be back, we'll find another bill on the vehicle. The bill could be surface later this year as an amendment to the Defense Department Authorization bill, the Senate has got 50 Democrats for it and Republicans wanted to pin a Senator James Jefferson for a month. Senate majority later Tom Bacheles swiftly pledged to bring the bill back to the Senate for by years in, there is no argument that can be made that hate crimes can be left unattended. Republican vote counters have expressed confidence before the vote. They could hold the bill's supporter short of 60 votes, but they said they were concerned about the effect on later votes. Senate Republican leader Trent Lot, the one with the POMP POMP, of Mississippi, suggested the Senate should be working on terrorism prevention instead of hate crimes. That's right and be sure to tell John Aschrop that too while you're at it. Trent, nice POMP, by the way, sweetheart. Right, that's going to be the new, they're opening up a new chain of stores. Our next to toys, our us homophobia, our us, going to be the Republican, new us. Dallas Bishops meeting his critical says the a news day, our writer Richard and Osling, the religion writer for the Associated Press, actually. The scandals have accumulated steadily since 1984, but for America's Roman Catholic hierarchy and it's locked in early 64 million. Clerical sex abuses finally become intolerable amid a flood of accusations, lawsuits, and resident reservations this year. Now, US bishops must try to weed the crisis and regain their credibility of critical meaning and Dallas. You know something we should be doing a show there tomorrow. Okay, let's go. Maybe we could have a special guest. Yeah, he could be on. By Friday night, hundreds of US bishops hooked to in two days of deliberations by showing a new national policy to be formed the churches handling of abuse allegations, then they pray the storm that has raged around them for months will subsided last. A top-the-list of issues is zero tolerance for abusers, specifically whether it will all preach to molested one minor in the past, but no more than that to stay in the clergy under type restrictions. And of course, if they murdered one in the past, they can probably still stay in two, right? I don't know. Yeah, you get one chance. Oh, that's right. One murder, one armed robbery, one high jacking, you get a coupon like a drink ticket. Right. One free pass like get out of jail, you know. For the integrity of the church leadership, this the most important meeting they've ever had since JP Dolan, a university of noter flame historian who thinks that this gathering far overshadows any other since the nation's vision began mainly regularly in 1919. Here are the Black South scandal, by the way. I think there's no coincidence. The world is watching the Catholic world of non-Catholics as well, says Bishop George Neera, or of Salt Lake City, one of eight prelets on the ad hoc committee on sexual abuse. He's not exaggerating there'll be roughly three media staffers for each bishop with 740 journalists granted credentials by a June 1st cutoff and 150 late commers turned away. Year ago, the bishop's meeting in Atlanta attracted a mere small handful. And most of the bishop said they would minus small handful. In many other nations in Atlanta Vatican, Bishop's only conferred behind closed doors. Here are the sessions will be public except for a confidential discussion tomorrow afternoon. Catholic caucuses left and right will be out in force, staging media panels and candlelight visuals and lobbying hard. They like it hard, George. Civil disobedience at the Stateless Secured Meeting Hotel is a possibility. Overall, the atmosphere is in keeping with the sense Catholics have the church have the church being under siege in recent months. It's under siege, baby, make no mistake about it. Jesus Christ. Three vicious but enforced resign is your following sexual misconduct allegations, including Bishop Williams of Lexington, which we talked about before. Nearly 250 priest of resounder been suspended, victims of filed at least 300 civil lawsuits and district attorneys have weighed criminal charges. Two priests have committed suicide after being accused of abuse and another one to one and Baltimore was shot. The hit him with one shot and he's still alive. Anglican parishioners have met in church basements while angrier ones pick a carton allaw Boston Cathedral demanding his resignation. Ecclesiastal Ecclesia, what is it? Ecclesiastical matters have become the fair of talk radio. Oh yeah, political cartoonists and late night comedians as well as sober editorial writers. It's a crisis of the vicious own making as the first rap policy from the ad hoc committee, which will sift last minute changes to document today mildly acknowledges. The problem is not just that clergy molested miners that happens in other faiths and professions, but many bishops covered up bumbleed and reassigned of users to new parishes where they abused it again. While abuse claims of surface continually since the 1980s it was the news in January that Boston Church officials did a little more than shuttle serial pedophile John Gagan from parish to parish that caused the questions to explode nationwide. So I'm going to get together tomorrow and see how they can continue to cover up, how they can make you know give a good dog and pony show. Attent writer Orianna Falacchi's latest book Insights Hate Prince Against Muslims is a French anti-racism group that started legal proceedings to stop the work distribution in France. Falacchi responded yesterday by saying she reserved the right to sue the group for calling her book racist. The movement against racism and for friendship between people referred to Falacchi's book The Rage and the Pride is a skating, I slah, Islamophobic tack. There's a new word for you, I like it. We know homophobic now we got a skating Islamophobic tack. The preceding started Monday also target pl<|ru|> the book's publisher in France. Falacchi best known for her uncompromising interviews with world leaders and did a decade long self imposed silence after 9.11 by writing a book in anger reaction to the terrorist attacks in New York where she lives. Critics have accused the former resistance fighter and workhorse funded of writing an anti-Muslim anti-immigrant uh... tirade. In one passage that the movement against racism objects to Falacchi writes that Muslims multiply like rats. Oh they must learn that from the Catholics. Especially the Catholics in Latin America. Or maybe from the shwarfs as you think? I'm not saying nothing. Good. In another she says that the children of Alas spend their time with their bottoms in the year, praying five times a day. Braccom. Wow. A spokeswoman for the book's French publisher said it had just been informed that they complained did not immediately have a comment. Of course. Resolute which publishes a month or three related to Joe Resolute. I'll call him right now. Resolute which publishes Falacchi's book and Italy said the book was doing September in the US. The title is Unknown and Resolute Refuge to Disclosed the Name of the American publisher. Mulad Ahunut. The movement against racism, Secretary General said his group believes in freedom of expression, but he said this insights racial violence its racist delirium. Falacchi responded. I reserved the right to sue MRAP for the insult races. And I remind Mr. Maloud that Ahunut, or whatever his name is, then in France as well as in the West, there's freedom of thought and opinion of expression and of the press. Since the regime of pride was released in France in May, most major newspapers have devoted opinion pieces to it. And Friday's edition of La Figaro Falacchi said she's been receiving death threats. How do you like that? From those peace love and the Muslims, no doubt. When you're animals, anyone. Oh, George has said that. I guess you're not getting no more magazines from Captain Singh. He's not a man. I guess Mohammed ain't going to be coming to fix up your satellite dish no more or less. You know what you're starting to sound like? You started sounding like an Islamophobic to me.

And thank you very much again for reminding me Also thanks to somebody who facts me pages and pages of propaganda that they're trying to teach your kids. I'm taking this home to show it to my child. Yeah. It says this is the kind of religious garbage that Bush and Ascrafth are using the brainwashed the children of the US. It's completely disgusting. Teaching kids these lies doesn't help anybody. Only ensures the US will be behind an education for a long, long time. What's so wrong about teaching scientific fact? Sorry, audio religious assholes. You're going to be dead someday. Just like all the rest of us. There are no poorly gates, no Allah, no Moses or whatever bullshit. Just stop the being so we can accept it. Grow up. Excellent. The summation, sir. You got your thumb right on it. And then he facts his me all these of this propaganda that did you read any of this? Huh? Yeah, I've been reading it. Here, what do you mean did I read any of it? Well, because it's fascinating. I expect people like that they keep bringing up creation scientists. There's an oxymoron if I ever heard one. Look, dumb and dumb. Or that's what it's all about. Keep people superstitious. If you walk under a ladder, if a cat black cat crosses your path, superstitious, hockest pocus, that's what it's all about. Fear of death, fear of hell. And just like Madeline on her use to say when she was still alive, religion without a hell isn't worth a damn. And she was absolutely correct. Jesus Christ. Hi, my name is Matt and this is my sister Laura. We grew up around the creation of an ancient evidence museum. Our dinosaur friend's name is Muncher. The adiator is the operative war baby. This page will teach you how many of the things we've learned about how God created the world. Join us as we explore God's creation. Let me say it again. There doesn't need to be any long argument for anybody with a brain. Pick up the Old Testament. Pick up that stupid piece of crap. Open the first page. And read the first page and then you'll throw it away. You'll say this is ridiculous. Even little children would laugh at this. About creation. Oh yeah, he created the stars to rule the lesser light to rule the night and the bigger light to rule the, yeah, he created two lights. And then it says like an afterthought, he made the stars also. Would no knowledge whatsoever that the sun is a star or that these lights is they refer to them. One was the moon, one was the star. They didn't have a freaking clue these an theanithal people. And supposedly all these billions of people in the world today are you know guiding their lives based on this archaic crap. They didn't know the moon from the, don't take any bulls from it. Or from the cock of all. That's what I was trying for, but you started to do with one finger, you know. I know cock of all. That's why I was looking for. And you know something like she said. Don't take any bulls down. That fits in here too. God damn it. I wonder how she's doing. Now that we don't take any calls anymore. She's fine. Is she? She calls from time to time. Good. How do you know that? Well, I take calls. I see when you're on taking those awful calls. Anyway, that's right, Laura. It says, but I was wondering if there were any other differences between the earth today and the earth before the flood other than the weather. Actually, there were quite a few differences for starters the continents were in the same places they are today. I'd believe that at one time South America Southern Africa Antarctica, Indiana, Australia all formed one big land mass. And of course, if the president keeps his global warming thing going on, pretty soon they'll all be one big water mass. Oh, I got a great editor on M to see how I segue into this. I'm not going to waste any time. I think whoever fact me this profusely, but it just makes me nauseous sick of my stomach. See, that's an oxymoron. Okay. Creation science. It's an oxymoron. Only stupid people believe in crap like that. Stupid right. Superstitious barbaric, grotesque ignorant people. But no balls. I mean, how big of a parody have to have to think for yourself, this big. What that was then? I just turned back there. Was that somebody out there in my door? Maybe want to go get it? No. I thought it was the fast machine, but it sounded like I might have been somebody out the door. Anyway, nobody home. Bob Herbert wrote in the New York Times a few days ago, June 6th, ignoring a growing peril. Very weird. He says the Bush administration has acknowledged that the U.S. will experience far reaching and in some cases devastating environmental consequences as a result of global warming. But it doesn't plan to do much about it. The administration has been so poor when it comes to climate change that this odd bit of news was initially seen as some sort of progress. It was thought momentarily that the president might be starting to pull his head out of the increasingly hot sand on this issue. The administration in a agency report, which was compiled by the environmental protection agency, notes that the warming of the U.S. is expected to be greater in the 21st century than in the 20th and will affect nearly every region of the country. Caesar expected to rise, causing an additional loss of coastal wetlands, storm surges will pose a greater threat to coastal communities. We'll have to endure more stifling heat waves and the disruption of snow-fed water supplies. Some treasured ecosystems such as the Rocky Mountain Meadows and certain coral reefs in barrier islands are likely to disappear entirely. In addition to acknowledging that the Earth is already sizzling, the report made it clear that human activity, the burning of fossil fuels that released heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, was the primary culprit. This was no more than the statement of the obvious, most reputable scientists, but the acknowledgement was a first for the environmentally challenged Bush administration. And yet even with this most minimal acceptance of reality, it was too much for the truck that I winged at the president's party. Shrieks about rage arose among conservatives who immediately and loudly demanded that the president turned his back on the report and various head even more deeply in the sand. So on Tuesday there was meaning a week ago or Tuesday, there was George W. Bush doodifully distancing himself from his own administration's handy work. He assured one and all that he had no plans to lead any assault on global warming. He was coldly dismissive of the indurgency effort, I read the report put on by the bureaucracy he said. That must have been pretty demoralizing for the people that worked hard to put the report together. If Mr. Bush did read it he saw in chapter 6 an interesting ex and encapsulation of the projected global warming experience in the west of the next few decades. Siding plausible model scenarios, the reports said many areas of the country would undergo a change comparable to an overall northward shift in weather systems and climate conditions. The central tier of states would experience climate conditions roughly equivalent to those now experienced by the southern tier and the northern tier but experienced conditions much like the central tier. The changes already underway. Some areas are experiencing a shorter duration of lake ice and there's already been a northward shift in the distribution of some species of butterflies. These are changes that force you to wonder what kind of environment lies in weight is two or three generations hence. And yet we continue with very little restraint to spew out the so-called greenhouse gases. The U.S. is by far the biggest defender on a planet producing about 25% of all the greenhouse gas emissions in the world. But the U.S. has refused to participate in the Kyoto Propecure Protocol and international treaty that calls for the mandatory reduction of greenhouse gases by industrial nations. And the U.S. has refused to impose tough ant-turbed reductions on its own. Japan ratified the Kyoto Protocol on Tuesday and the 15 members of the European Union jointly presented their ratification to the one last week but with the mightiest power on a planet on wanting to participate and unwilling to formulate a real alternative the gases will just keep building and building causing the planet to get warmer and warmer. What we have here is a very serious problem that we understand and could do something about but so far because of a lack of presidential leadership we've taken a pass. The EPA report was called U.S. Climate Action report 2002. It should have been called the Inaction Report. What's Bob Herbert in last two days? New York Times. 1227 at 560 WQAM.

I'm over there and church street and do it Get all the fangs over there The high courts ruling expected some time next year could clarify how far states may go inventing a practice Associated with racial hatred and intimidation they recorded some Constitution of protection The court agreed to hear in appeal from Virginia where the state Supreme Courts struck down a 50 year old law that made it a crime to burn a cross to intimidate someone He sharply divided lower court rule that the state law was unconstitutional because such acts of bigotry are protected a protected form of speech The Virginia law is response to the class practice of setting crosses ablaze as a threat or warning to black people But it's warning says nothing about a racial motive instead banning the practice whenever its intent is to frighten the victim But what if you don't want to frighten anybody Right, what if you just want to roast the marshmallows the right to free speech is not absolutely Sympical pre-incorporate as previously rule at the government may prosecute some kinds of threatening a violence speech The line can be fuzzy since the government may not discriminate against speakers based solely on what they have to say 10 years ago the Supreme Courts struck down a hate crime ordinance from St. Paul, Minnesota that banned displays of Nazi swastikas or burning crosses that were intended to anger or alarm people on the basis of race-color Creed religion or gender the high court called that law an unconsonsumptuous discrimination against speech based on its content Courts in three states Florida, Washington, California have said that ruling does not apply to their laws the laws of four states South Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia have been struck down And so on it goes and of course with this fascist Supreme Court God only knows what's gonna pass his law with them I guess they're busy trying to elect the next president.
