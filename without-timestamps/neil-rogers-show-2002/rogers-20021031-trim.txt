So today, most of this is how Florida's only real source of your daily QAR. Or, or broadcast conversations. And tell you QAR.com. See, most words are in Halloween week. Lovely. Orange black. This is everybody who listens to your show. No. You gave me. Okay. And my main character was a guy in Jack Malloy who had worked in Vegas. And who got Almighty, who knows more about Vegas than you, Hank. So, I said, what job she's he have had. And you said, casino host and people just fell in love with this guy. So I'm going to bring him back and screw up his life and see if he can get out of it again. For a second, please. How are David Stukpitch? There is a girl in extra white jeans. A girl who said, weighs a ton. And she's living with the women at the funny play toys in the house of the ladies. A ride. When she was young and a restaurant with a boy, he didn't know that she was gay. Until he noticed each time they went out, she went for the seafood buffet. Just look at all those his dike. Sister's now. Just look what they have done. The minute she comes home from work to that door. Well off her bed, she's come. She laid it down. Just stop publishing the rosy mag. Let the laid off staff not paid. And rose his girlfriend whose pregnant. Right now, I guess she just only got laid. There is a girl with extra white jeans. And her chain or she's become. And she goes by the name of rosy oldie in the house of the ladies. She goes by the name of rosy mag. I can't believe that. Wow, what's me by lucky day? How are David's a bit? I changed my mind. 903 at 5.60 WQA. Happy Thursday too. So anyway, tonight's a big night. Even ugly Chuck is going to be their treasure island. Ninets are usual thing that we do on Wednesday. But it's for how we night tonight. Needless to say. So join George who's on vacation. But of course, doesn't want to miss out on the cash. And whatever else you might get. I think it's only going to be the cash. George, Bokeb Ryan and ugly Chuck. Now, fat boy wrote this thing. He didn't put Carlos. He wrote Chuckie. Hey Chuckie. From 5 to 7 at Treasure Island this afternoon. It's the big Halloween party with drink specials. On Cosmic Jelly, Yellow, Shots featuring Stephanie Evans. 5 to 7 at Treasure Island just off the palm of the 120 second street. She's not the one the escorter or whatever they call her. Yes, she is. I understand way in a back of the room if I were you and bring lots of paper towels. That's my suggestion. Now, Mike who must be psychic. Since we are first back to the morning. Could you please remove that ugly picture from your website? Well, Mike, your wishes are command. Not because you wish for it, but there's a long story we'll talk it into. A long story about that thing. I just want to say this right now. We've played on this program over the last few years. 80 stringent. Parodies on Bill Clinton. Skating, biting, ripping, humorous. 80 men, Al Gore, 20 million. Any complaints ever? No. Anybody getting hysterical about it? No. See, one thing limited difference. One of the many differences. Between moderates, liberals, anybody to the elective atilla de hun. And conservatives, or at least today's conservatives. And that is the the rest of us. Other than the conservatives, we got a sense of humor. The conservatives, the only thing they find funny is Bill cigar Monica's vagina. That's very funny, but other than that, they got no sense of humor. They're uptight and out of sight. So anyway, he says the two assholes make kissing almost makes me hurl y'all the other. He says replace it with a picture of moe, then I could print it and use it for target practice. Well, guess what, Mike, you wish is our command. Not this moe, but it's going to be moe Howard, the real one. He's going to be on there. So we're taking that first cut off of that CD. Not that I'm not going to play it again, but because there's a whole long, convoluted thing going on here. And it's just not worth the aggravation. It's just not worth the grief. Eric, it's not worth it. And of course it was all started by and the woman who dropped off that video tape this morning, how to get yourself some serious help, okay? Drops me off a birthday gift, it's a video tape, and I'm not even going to mention the website. White wing paranoia. This guy who's next guest is G Gordon Litty. Oh, brother. It's enough to make me want to say Howard David's a bit. But I won't say it. So anyway, this newsmax.com. You might want to check that out if you're into right wing paranoia. That's the website where Condoleezza Rice targeted by racial song parody. So this guy obviously saw on the our website, came across that thing with a picture. And of course, unfortunately, I had no idea who had the idea with the wording on there about the name of the song, cause it's an aggraved morning. And then Fox news, let me just a message saw you ask holes at Fox news, including that bits. It's been calling everybody 100 times every day. We're not interested because I know exactly what you're looking for. That is to take something out of context, twist it into something that it's not. Make a whole big stimulus about it for fun in your profit, okay? On the fascist news network. See, that's their motto at Fox unfair and unbalanced all spin all day. They're the spin monsters, including Bill don't confuse me with the facts or Riley. For him, it's me nauseous. I turned it on for the first time in months last night for about two minutes, and that's all I can handle. Talk about a self-serving papa sense. You know what he is? He's a rush wannabe. A rush wannabe and as much as I disagree politically with rush. You got to admit he's got his, I mean, your small potato's bill, okay? You're in a dream world. And by the way, Mufford and Hell's the guy named Raining Book, you know? It's Thursday already. I know I'm not going to get my champion like that, that's another reason. PD Lenny man, you're so full of crap. Luckily though, make a second clock, I'm looking at my diet right soda. I do like diet right. And I forgot their mind you. Yeah, thanks. Chuckie. Diver at Kiwi's strawberry, no less no reason I like diet right is not only just got, it's got no caffeine, it's got no nothing in it. And the taste? And taste great. If you're like diet soda, you don't need no diet soda, your skin is a, 1193 votes on a skinny, is itkabod crane happy Halloween folks? A lot of folks are praying for rain tonight. I mean, heavy, heavy rain isn't that in the forecast? They were saying the other day. Well, and Brian, no more cross. I am so sick and tired of your act. Everyday, well, I, they were going to have the humidity, made it slowly, slowly going on. He's been saying that for three weeks. And every day we set a new temperature record, and it's so humid you could got the in fry eggs on the sidewalk. Where's the rating book, Muff? No, seriously, you can't tell me it's not here yet. Well, they, when they said sometime, maybe next week, I didn't think that they met this late in the week. No, it would have been here. I think they're hiding it. Probably Greg is sitting on it. Maybe he and Square, are sitting on it together, and the book too. Here's more stuff about priest. Oh, gee, I don't, I'll put it on my pile. Thank you very much. I got too much important stuff going on here. So anyway, if you want to check out newsmax.com, this guy takes stuff out of context. And of course, I'll explain this morning, and then I will play the song. I will play it all at a very, very exciting. I'm not going to stop playing that song. We have one complaint that all of a month. We play that song in a show. No, and you want to know why because the people listen to the show. Understand what it's all about. Understand what it's all about. I'll get into it at length. Let me $193 votes. What's your take on the 200 plus Haitians who were smuggled in. I mean, who got here on Tuesday? Smuggled in, huh? What a surprise, not. And for I'll tell you something, poor Jeff. He doesn't know what they'll do. And there is of all people, carry mec. You know, carry. I'm really glad you did that, because politically it's wonderful. But from a pragmatic sake for the black folks that you're supposed to be representing. The first jobs that Haitians take when it come in here are black Americans. Those are the first jobs they take away. Yep. So I don't understand what you and then all these is a columnist. Oh, it just wrenches your heart, Michael Mayoy. You know, that's fine. But these people could be from Haiti. They could be from Guatemala. They could be from all kinds of place. What are starving into the conditions are terrible. And there's slippers. What does that mean? So we're going to be bleeding hearts and feel sorry for the whole world all over again. I'll tell you, I'm watching MMSNBC yesterday when I'm starting to agree with Papu Cannon and get pissed off and don't press. I know something's wrong somewhere. You know, bleeding heart bill press. But at any rate, they have come out to be. It was a smug reveal. But anyway, here's what it said. No more refugees. Close the gate. 688 almost 1200 volts. 57.4%. They should be sent back immediately. No questions asked. 217.8.8.1%. They should be allowed to apply for political asylum. 171.4.2%. They should all be allowed to stay only 65.4%. Only Cuban should be allowed to stay when it reaches the US. 56.6% fixed. I said that. And I'd like to point out by the way, I'm sure that a lot of you are aware of it. This new policy, which I haven't really thought very much about. But the new policy about the Haitians being detained and held in the attention for possibly months. This is a George W. Bush thing. That's ridiculous. And here's an article in which one is it? The hero source of US policy on Haitian migrants will well-kept secret. And 10 Kennedy called hearing the trying to get the find out where to held this whole policy came from and how they sneaked it in there. It's a racial thing. There's no question about it. A racial and political thing. Because like I said yesterday, Haitians have no political cloud and they tend to vote democratic if they vote. And Cubans, we know where to how they vote. So Jim Bush can talk about. How they should be treated like everybody else. Does that include Cubans, Jeff? No, he didn't mention that. Call your brother in a White House. Oh, give me a break. He talked to the White House. Even say I talked to my brother because that would be bad for me. He's going to talk to the White House. Just to the House, not to anybody in it. Talk to the building. Didn't get much response. Got about as much responses when I talked to Mo. Howard David's. Okay, just calm down. Okay, just relax. It's going to be a big night Monday and green vagus calm down. 11 past nine at five 60 WQM. We got a new pool for today and line with all this history again about words and people taking things out of context and trying to twist them around just like you grave robber's there at Fox. But with all the stuff that's going on with a sniper and the elections and the big rally. I'm going to sort of that the Jesse got all been out of shape about Jesse Ventura that is and all the Republicans and then the ad Coleman goes on TV. He's doing interviews in front of a picture of the same kind of plane at Paul Valsdon. Why then? Well, what's going on here? And you wonder why nobody votes? Wonder why nobody votes? 11 after nine at five 60. If you're tossing in turn at night, not probably not because you're worried about all these things but because your mattress sucks. It's lumpy. It's bumpy. It's worn out. So if you're feeling cranky because you can't get a good night sleep. Do the smart thing called a bedding experts at dial a mattress. One 800 mattress. When you call it number you'll be guaranteed a stupid. They do pen to the great solid night sleep. No matter even if they're drop an eight-bombs next door. Tattle mattress carries all the top brands, Seely, Cirta Simmons, King Coral and every size and covered level, which means the mattress you want is in stock available for immediate delivery. Recently they set up the lovely McGill with a brand new bed and he is just screwing his brains out into it and got a big smile on his post. He looks better than ever. The folks at dial a mattress did exactly what they promised like they always do. No BS. No excuses. No B&L. No Baton's wish just a great comfortable relaxing night sleep for McGill and his lovely fiance, whoever he is. When the crew from dial a mattress got to McGill's home, they set up his mattress to go away to crappy old smelly one. So I'll be tempted by stores going out of business who can't and won't deliver. And don't forget today's the last day to take advantage of this. That's right. It's the 31st. Free delivery from dial a mattress if you call and get you new mattress today. So do what today. 1 800 mattress. That's the number to call. And do like McGill and I do sleep like a baby. 1 800 mattress. 1 800 MATTT RES for dial a mattress. Brand name beds for busy. People don't forget call today and take advantage of free delivery. Just the last day for that. I like and love all. This is for 205. You way. Don't have a penis. No. No all bush. Daughter of Florida Governor Jeb Bush records her first page from her prison audio diary. I cannot believe that pompous egotistical judge actually sent his need to jail. Me to jail. Hello. Do you see my last name on the document? Bush. By the time my dad jab gets none with him, he won't be able to scratch his danglers without the sheet coming down on him. He won't even be able to get an internship with bird. The black bail is from Judge Judy. I wonder if the prison pharmacy looks at my scre for Sanx. They better. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to watch all that crack in my monoloblanics. I should have stowed the junk in the trunk. If you know what I mean. I got 10 days of jail and my boo's pound cousin Jenna Skates. My father's got no juice. He can rig an election but he can't keep his own flesh and blood out of jail. Oh. Did I say that? I didn't mean that. I got to go. We got a big game behind the carrot going in the recroom. Did I say that? I didn't mean that. Yes, we are. Get out of here, Mom. If you're beyond a year and a second before you know it. 9.16 at 5.60 WDQ. I am. Yeah, you have your own show. Duff is going to do a little show here today until you're all about all the problems we have in the building. We don't have any problems. Everything is beautifully written. Paradise. Make no mistake about that. Although I did hear that. Howard David's bitch. Oh, that's not the right one. Well, maybe somebody is. Anyway, so we got the rating book. It sucks. Not too good. I'll know you know something. It's up from last summer. So what do you want? What do you want? We had a little George on there. It's up from last summer. What is he? I've given you the old thumb. What is he saying? We're up a SharePoint. We're up a whole SharePoint from last summer. There you go. Ron, are we in baby? Oh, even though Howard David's the bitch. And she's by the bed. Okay, let me take a look and see. You know where we really dropped off because it's probably partly because of my reading all that crap on here that pondress. It is. Don't you think all that we went up? Man 18 to 34. How about you? We took a precipitous crap. You know what I'm saying? This station doesn't for a sports station. This station doesn't. I was looking at that 95 book. Where the hell was it? It's around here somewhere. At IOD. Man 18 to 34. Wild did much better back. That was 19.95, seven years ago. Much better. Wouldn't you think 18 to 34 would be a pretty decent demographic man? You would think so? Yeah. It's a very football season. No, those guys. Well, when we got the punks, you know. Oh, not that good. That's all though. Look at that. Last summer, many 18 to 34, but that's 10 to 3. That's all I'm adding. All I'm adding is the bogust you like. I mean, it really big August. 1.7 last summer, a 2.5 to 10 to 3. Now what about in the, uh, oh, oh. Mornings. 6 to 10 a.m. Last summer, we had a 1.8 net. This time we got just a, uh, 0.8. 0.8 in the morning. Woo. Man, what if that's because Howard David's a bit. I wonder if that has something to do with it. I don't know. But we just don't to kick and say 18 to 34 at all. And, uh, am I looking at the right station? Oh, no, that's not us. That's, uh, I OD. I can't. Well, I'm mentioning WIO. Do you want to win? Oh, how do we to God damn book on? Oh, look at that. We went up from last summer. And I was gone. Well, you're the best baby. Must be that hairpiece. Last summer, we had a 3. Oh, that's not the right one either. I could carry on till noon with this. Let me give you this. I'll just give you some numbers. One, three, two, five. Yeah. Let's go. 1.5 last summer, 1.2 in a demo in a morning's this time. So down just a hair. Oh, sorry. Said that. Down just a couple of. Kinky hairs. Mo. What about the bit. Oh, who? 3.0 last summer in a midday. Mostly George and then a 3.3 this time. But that wasn't George's. And that was the mad dog with a focus August. He had a month and August. You think that everybody in the world was doesn't mad dog. And by the way, mad dog quit talking about my sponsors. They're ripping off your phone number. You know how long. First mortgage America has been on this show. How long? One was alien. What was that going on? Because that number that number 1.800 L.E. N.D. I used to say, Ali, Ali, Ali, Ali on. What happened to your how I used to say it? I remember. How long ago was that? That's at least two years ago, right? Maybe I think more than that. So they've been on here on a show for a coup in Zagin. He's on your understanding. You know, you got a peddle of your sponsor. You know, you got a good luck. You mad dog. You got some. But get out of here with that crap about they stole your number or their number. Hey, alright. Do you know that I had this is the truth. Not that anybody gives a crap. E.11. E.11 solicitation calls at home yesterday. I get home at one thirty. I mean, who knows how many times it rings in a morning? They're going up then. E.11. Seventy day before 11 yesterday. And then you know when the last one was a fax? 12.55 in a morning. Five to one. I'm sound asleep. I hear the phone ring. Our reachover luckily. I got a phone right by the bed. I reachover and grab it. Beating of the faxing sound. Right. Five to one in a morning. So it's probably like a west coast thing. And I never thought about that. Or sometimes they do it at that time because they know that. They won't get a busy signal. The great. I'm going to tell you something. You ask holes that keep a bug in us on our phone at home. We're going to stick in really pissed off and fired up. Aren't we? Just like the American public. Like they got a cold in yesterday about people should there should be revolutions in the street. Not from this crowd. No. Not from this crowd. Not America today. Too passive. Too many followed leader kind. Oh, did we redo the pull here? Eric? What was that all about? I'm going to have to vote again. Here's the pull today. Which one of these words do you think is most offensive? Nigger, spick, cike, faggot, wop, or none of the above. They're just words. That's in line with that video that we play Kiss and Ager Good Morning. I'm going to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of but it's like a breeding ground for a wacko as wingnuts. So this newsmax calm and you can read it if you want, I'm not going to take the time to read it. Congolese rice targeted by racial song parody, the Togree campaign against African Americans at the Bush White House is said to turn ugly when they're coming weeks with a release of a new music CD featuring a cover photograph of President Bush Reading National Security Advisor Condolese rice with a social kiss and a track inside called Kisay and doesn't even spell that out. You have the blanks and blanks that out. God forbid, morning. Oh God forbid. Performed by Volkab Ryan, a soft photo singer whose turdies are regular feature on the New York. And then it goes on about Mr. Rogers, whose white has a website that features an array of anti Bush material such as harsh biographies by former Clinton aid Paul Begallan, a Civic Texas critic Molly Ivins, as well as links to reports like smoking gun, evidence I may be above. Well, you know, it's interesting. I'm not going to waste my time writing stories and the sending missiles around the country about your right wing of website because I don't really give a crap. You can pull whatever kind of garbage I know you want, but don't take stuff out of context from this show and try to make it seem like something that it's not, which is just exactly what the Fox people were trying to do and we're not going to play the game with them. And by the way, honey, if I go there, Fox, the CDs you ordered, you're not going to get them. And either is anybody else. We're not the airs, not sending you those out. So if you ordered one of those and you wanted that particular cut, you ain't going to get me, you can get your money back or whatever. Huh? Go. Because they're just replacing it with another moment. It's going to be all moments with a different cover because the right wingers want to make a big stimulus about it. It's not worth it. It's not worth having him up there going through all the grief of physical threats and wackos and all this other crap. This is the way the right wing deals in this cover. You have no more freedoms anymore. This business are freedom of speech is a myth. And what they're looking for next Tuesday, man, they're foaming at the mouth right now. They've already got control of the two thirds of the government, the judiciary and the executive, and now they can get control of legislative next Tuesday to have a clean sweep. Next Tuesday could be the last election we ever have quite frankly. If it was up to them, it was up to them no more elections. My dictatorship. But at any rate. So that's our pull question today. So far we already got 27 votes, which were of these words you find most offensive. None of the above they're just words 16, which is obviously the right answer. Nigger 7, Kike 4 and Unperspect Faggot or Wop. How about if it's the do-op shop? They get upset about that. They got upset when at God God can. Poor Tom Jick or what a big thing about that. And then couldn't even get the frequency right for waxy. You know, waxy 710, I mean, 790. Come on Tom, get something right. Get a place. Oh, he's a little bit of the right. So here's the book that I've been screaming about to bring you in. Wait to see what we got in. Of course, this doesn't mean anything for us. Because the numbers we see when used to be on 10 to 2 Neil. Yes. Then it was like most of the 10 to 3 day part. Because the day parts are broken up 6 to 10 a.m. 10 to 3, 3 to 7, 7 to 7, 7 to midnight. Right. Now that it's 6 to 10, 10 to 3. Well, this doesn't tell me anything about what we're doing. And this is how the breaks are. So what did you bring me this stupid book for, Doc? I'm just a joke. But you bring me this stupid ass book. We need Maddie Bell to break this all down. No matter how you break it down, the summertime here sucks. There's nobody here to sampling his growth test. It's set of and so on. Let's see, women. Look at the women we got. We have no women on this show. That's part of the problem. IOD, we average about a 1.5-year and woman 25 to 54 on my show, which is still pretty inversingly low. Here, you know what the average is in the last four books of 0.9 in midday, 0.9. I think it's the gathering. The gambling. The gambling, the gambling talk. It's a sports station. And it's an AM station. You think most women listen to AM stop talking about I'm going to be a jive 100. Listen to AM radio. See, that's one good thing about fascist news network about Fox. That makes me feel a little bit. I was thinking about this last night. Even though they got those big numbers, nobody under the age of 100 watches any of those talking had that worse. Unless there's something really special going on like the sniper dealer post 9-11. Other than that, nobody out of the age of death watches CNN, MSNBC or Fox News. They may have a big lot of comedy. Huh? Fox News for a little bit of comedy. What's it all on? No. There's no comedy on that. It's the fascist news network. All spin all day, unfair and unbalanced. And they got the goal to talk about fair and balanced. And there's a bunch of people out there stupid enough to believe that. I think if they're attracted that pancake makeup, that's what does it. All the orange people. I mean, you got to face it. There is no other network that has as many orange people on here as they do in Fox. That's true. What couldn't you think they could afford a little bit? And of course, why should they change? Oh, by the way, good news for Chuck E. Beesley radio post to profit. Are you ready for that? Wow. Beesley, broadcast and somebody facts this to me. But thank you very much. PD Lenny already came in here to disturb me deeply this morning by 20 was sound. Beesley, the Naples based radio broadcast, after that, a six station is how to report a net profit. Nearly one and a half million dollars a net revenue of 28.8 million for the three months. Any September 30th compared to a net loss of 11.5 million a net revenue last year is same period. How do you like that? They said that favorable same station revenues and improvements, by advertising contributed to the third quarter results. All right, so they're making some money to have any facts paper here. No, it's Chuck E. gotten paid yet. No. Keep pricks. That's what Bobmer Bootsen. You know what else he said? Howard David's a bitch. 926 at 560 WQM. Let's face it.

I'm at this point ready to just say take the whole guy damn thing off it. All together. There is a line in here that is so outrageous because I found out from a good friend of my late last night who were the so this newsmax dot com thing was behind us. And he's got a paragraph and he was so outrageous that was based on some speculation the other day and he puts it down here. He's sending this out allegedly to people who wanted to buy that CD.

The two of you can run off and just eat all these. Anym on a phone? No, you tell him if he sends this out to one person, I will personally come to his house with Luca Brazzi and will send with Moe's wig and will like us squash him like an ant because that's patently untrue. It's Eric. Oh, I thought it was Boca Bran. Well, you tell Eric to get a hold of his little quizzling neck. See, this is all on the air here. This is great. I don't want to be doing this. I want to be doing a radio show. But the two of them, out of control, this thing got so far off. Okay. 72 votes on a poll, which of these words do you think is the most offensive? The only reason I'm doing this is because it is big stink about kissing a good morning. Let me give you the background, the real background. First of all, before anybody on this show or any of you out there were talking about kind of leaves and rice. Many, many months ago, in fact, I got it off the net this morning. Where'd it go? The guy's name is Randall Kennedy. A black professor, college professor Randall Kennedy, and he wrote a book called Nigger, the strange career of a troublesome word. He was on CNN. He was on MSNBC. I'm sure he must have been on Fox, but because I don't watch them very often. I don't know, but I'm sure he was on here. He was making a rounds because of the controversy. Also, you'll discover what was that all about? Just saying that all the worried that he's not something anything else. Anybody, but I don't know how he knows if Boca Bran is something. Because they're joined at the hip. Don't you understand better. But it would be a bit of a, it's a tool that they're like running their whole guy at our website. They're going to have to do with my guy named website. My name is on there. Stop. See, send a sist. Anyway, so let's see, Nigger and autobiography by Digregory. There are the Nigger Bible by Robert De Quiddler. A whole bunch of books with, this is from Amazon.com. But the first one is Nigger, the strange career of a troublesome word. The point that this guy was trying to make is he was saying it is now in some cases, politically correct. It's acceptable to use the word Nigger. And of course, a lot of black people call each other Nigger. He heard all the time. Hey, Nigger. So anyway, this show for years. My point is being that if you use a lot of words, you take any word. Like today's Thursday, Thursday, Thursday. And you say 50 times in a row, by the time you get to the 50th time, it doesn't know meaning anymore. Exactly. It has no meaning. And so at a point, that's why I'm taking that poll question today. If you say these words often enough, you're desensitized. Yeah, there are a lot of other people like to hurt you would like, you know, bullets and knives. And those things are evil, doers. And bombs. But the fact that a matter is that words, even though it may be old and tried words, don't hurt anybody. If you're going to be all uptight about words and an OJ thing to use the N word, you know, let's grow up already in this country. Okay? And stop worrying about snickin' words. So at the time that that came up, and then at the same time, they had brought up about once at the last 50 times they've done it last three years. And this business about black people wanting restitution for slavery, and they happen to come up pretty much at the same time. So that's when Bokabran put together this thing called the restitution song, or kiss in Nigger Good Morning. And that's what it's all about. Head nothing with Condolisa. And when we put together the CD this year, the Bokabran, the second CD restitution, he found this picture of George W. Planiakis on Condolisa's cheek. The song wasn't written about Condolisa. He got her own song, by the way, which we will play. And we'll continue to be playing these songs on this on this show. Great song. We're not going to let any white wing of Wako's and a guy down their website, try to twist this out of what it means. But that's what they like to do. Don't confuse this with the truth. Just like Bill, don't confuse me with the truth, or Riley. And by the way, I just looked into Bokababran, the book F.T. I'll show it all. Mr. Hot Shot. You know, Lard Nats had a big summer head that huge just September in here with an H.E.R. If you don't show it all there in this market, Mr. Or Riley, don't confuse me with the truth. Mr. Spindoctor. I'll spin all night. Spin this, we'd art. In fact, when they were getting ready to put his ass on the air with that radio show, the people from Fox and those days, you can ask George, we're calling here. Oh, well, we'd like to invite Neil to be a guest on Bill's show. But how about if he won't do that, how about if Bill's it? We don't have guest on his show. But if we want you on it, I'm going to go on his show. So we can let me say about three words and then cut me off in mid sentence and use me as a human prop. The only reason he has guest on a show is to use him as a prop. That's all. In a matter of what they say, he's not that he's not listening to a word they say. Oh, what you're absolutely wrong. And then he comes out with his bogus statistics, which are always wrong anyway. But don't confuse the public with the facts. Just like the right wing paranoid, so listen to Rush for two years, and I've told stories about it. And he just makes up at random about Hillary Clinton killed this one and Bill Clinton killed that one. And you know, just makes it up. Vince Foster did this and, you know, by Frankie Pentangeli all over again. So did I get my point across or not? I think so. Then I explained to the origins of this song and what it's all about. And during all the times that we play them, we have plenty of black people listening to the show. We've never had one complaint. Not one person is said, you'll better stop playing that, Mr. That's what Bill Gray said, because they understand the humor in the show. And they understand it's consistent. I use the word Faggot. I use the word Kike. I use the spik. Who gives a crap about words? You got to have a sense of humor for Christ's. I'm getting palpati. I'm getting palpati. The humor. God. Hey, one must have found a way. Three in birds and four backfades. I'm 200 years ago when they were slaves. We're not only having a mobile home. A pitiful and a pinch of skull. So if you want to ask me how here's what I got to say. You've got to kiss a bigger gunman. You're a real man, you're sorry for it's lay the home. Kiss a bigger gunman. And that's where every money was dead at home. If I was born in 1802, old and slaves ate something I'd do. But what were that people did to you? I have to take the flying. You're a little foreign old man. With the can of fairly cherry in fact, it's still a 40 acres and a view. I have a better way. You've got to kiss a bigger gunman. And one on how a parent bargain for a man to kiss a bigger gunman. No. And that's your best intuition for a slave at you. Kiss a bigger gunman. And tail and that's your sorry for a slave in a month. Yeah, got to kiss a bigger gunman. And that's where every money was dead at home. I'm sorry I'm just so psychotic I could blow my brains up. Boca Brian, Boca off. I don't want to see again. Who's that? That freaky Carlos with that stupid pussy outfit. What was that? Somebody in their Halloween get up. Yeah, I could have seen the. Y'all they was wearing this Halloween get up this morning. Look like a gildy with a shirt on. Be sure. We got to call that that song is played by a black country singer. Yeah. You mean it is? I think so. Black country singer. It's played by a. I don't so I understand what anybody is saying here today. Folks, I think I'm speaking a wrong language. There must be it a wrong place like South Florida. There. Yeah, the song is played by a country singer. Black. Oh, that's right Charlie Pride must seem out of her. Didn't seem that many times. Right. No. I think that might even be the name of the. Charlie Pride sings kiss a nigger good morning. That's what we just got. I don't know. There's another version that he's talking about. So they're strong. Here's time. Hollywood is says congratulations on the bees. Like group profits. That's what Todd said. It was you and that black deal though. What done it? I think you're right. It's a big, big fat one for the nice handle on it. Easy to get a grip on it. Speaking of nose picker, did you see the look on James face? I'm curious. Meek stuck in it. I loved it. I mean politically it was wonderful. Even though she had no business being a, you know, this business. Look, it's not a quite an amazing sensitive. And no, they shouldn't be held in the attention. They should be. They shouldn't have the same rights as the other. Refugees get there. You know, go off with your relatives or whatever. And hopefully they show up with their asylum hearings. And then send them back. Right. Because I don't care what anybody tries to tell you. They're economic refugees. They're not political refugees. Most of the Cubans are needed for that matter. But, you know, that's already water over the dam. And politically it would be too explosive for Jeb or W. Anybody to say, well, let's repeal like Cuban adjustment act. So they're not going to do that. But we can't keep doing this. We just, I mean, how long does it take to learn your lesson in this town? And Mike Mayo and all you other bleeding hearts. Sure it's heartbreaking. But you know, something, how about if all these people came over on a huge ship from Africa? Would you just let him in? And then there's, there's God then built press on him. I could bleeding heart liberal friend on MSNBC. If they talk about the ship St. Louis during WW2 and how they came to Cuba, they turned it away. And they came to Saplaud and after they are turned it away. And they all went back to Europe and got most of them executed. Boy, we're not at war right now. I mean, we're war with terrorism. And by the way, nice job on a homeland security while we're at it. We're able to smuggle these people in who, and it's like that thing I got yesterday said that one article if there are the one facts. If they're able to smuggle in a bunch of people in, right in front of the nose of the court, it was two miles away from the goddamn coast guard. Yep. Two miles away. And they're able to smuggle in 220 people. How about somewhere offshore? We got this big huge coastline in his state. And the whole country for that matter, who knows where to held their Washington people up on shore? And the L president, we got under the guise of Homeland Security. We've got this separate policy for Haitians like there are real threat. Oh, yeah, we got a lot of Haitian terrorists. What is this man talking about? So I hope next Tuesday, even though I don't have it or grid, you added to it's un-immigration. Lot of you Haitian folks out there. I hope next Tuesday, not that they're listening. They remember all of this and go to the polls and vote, even though they probably won't. You see, the people falling on the ground outside the ironest building last night, and the protest rolling around on the ground in psychotic and screaming out. I mean, I can understand probably a lot of these people are their relatives. Right. But you just can't keep opening the doors and let everybody come in here. Why, how tragic it ended while he risked their lives to get in here? What about the people across the Mexican Texas border? You think they're riskin' their lives you bet? Same thing. They shoot them in a heartbeat. You just, I mean, you got to get control especially during these times. If there's anybody doesn't understand that during these times. Oh, but we got Homeland Security. Just look at big comrades. Don't he make you feel secured? No, it scares the hell out of me. Like a wooden Indian. But we're getting way behind.

See it's all a question of the Greece level. They tell the difference between the Greece level. Faggot 7. 7 people out there find out offensive. I find it amusing at this point. For example. I can't stand it. 10 people don't like kikes. I mean, nigger 40. So niggers like moving up there. I'm just worth 109. That's 64.1%. So we got nigger moving up on ladder. So to speak. 11.4.10 at 5.60 WQA. I'm source of US policy on Haitian migrants. Well kept secret. 10 months after was put into effect. The origin of the policy of incarcerating Haitians who arrive on Florida shores seeking political asylum remains a mystery that even veteran legislators apparently can't solve. How do you like that? It's a mystery. Critics decry the policy as discriminatory saying that no other nationality single out in jail. But where the policy came from within the Bush administration or even who established it remains unknown. Like everything else within this administration. It's a deep dark freak and secret. And nobody ain't saying nothing. In a brief statement on the latest arrival of Haitian immigrants in South Florida. And without a sprainly being incarceration policy, Attorney General John Heinrich Kimmer asked crops said that Haitians are being treated fairly appropriately and humanely. Right. Sure. Oh, and did you see what our Reflisher said yesterday. It bolted the Minister of Information. He says, oh, well, that's the policy we have to follow the law and we're not going to change it. And spite of what the president's brother. He didn't say that. And a brother can say he called up here all he wants, but we changed the number. Change the number, jab, get lost. Can we hope you'll lose? In recent months, some legislators on capital that will have sought to tell us from the Bush administration. How the policy was established to keep Haitian asylum secret in jail while their cases were weighed. The administration, however, won't say they won't say they just do things arbitrarily. They won't tell you when it was done. How why it was done? Who done it? And you talk about a free country, about a free guy. And this is what the lot of you people out there embrace. Everything is a deep dark mystery. We've been trying to put a face to this policy. He said Stephanie Cudders, spokeswoman for Senator Edward Kennedy, who cheers. They sent it so committee on immigration. Meanwhile, concerns about Haitian immigration are soaring as the hurricane season winds down and is Haiti's political economic conditions deteriorate with our self-abointed guy that we stuck back in there by the way. Many officials heard that it would take little to the win-tice of flood of Haitians to add for Florida, and during dangerous trips and rickety vessels, not to mention of course being smuggled in. See, that's another thing. If they just let these people stay here and the word gets back on a pipeline, and all of a sudden, just like during Mary Alvabe, you're going to have thousands and thousands of Haitians and others pouring out of the shores. Good what? Crap. In the past month, Haiti has approached the economic tailspin. Its currency, the Gord, has plunged 25% in value, good Gord. Haitian President John Bertrand, our esteed our agai, a former priest no less. Uh-huh. Is attempting to force all or run on his nation's banks, violence by thugs usually against opponents of our esteed is on the rise. He's our thug. Our priest thug. And for all the money that we're going to owe the billions that we're going to pay away not to mention the waste of human life in Iraq, with his, uh, contrived war. There's just imagine how much good instead of just a few million instead of like lip service, we could like really build up the economy down there. Give these people a reason to be alive and put a real government in there. And of course, it has so much more impact on our lives because it's right here in our hemisphere, and we got people washing up on sure from their every goddamn day. Something that really affects our lives. Something that's a threat to the national security and the economy and everything else. But they have no oil as opposed to this fantasy. Oh, but it got good baseballs. You're so in them too tight. The policy of detaining Haitian asylum seekers while they awaited determination of their status began and mid December, surely after a boatload of 1807 Haitians found it off Miami and Rick and Sus Ronnier saying boatloads. And then he never heard that no more. The director from the INS headquarters in Washington, order federal authorities in South Florida, keep Haitian asylum seekers locked up unless otherwise authorized by Washington. INS officials initially denied the director, but are response to a lawsuit. INS acting deputy director Peter Michael Beckraft said in March 19th, David, that the new policy was designed to avoid a mass migration and to discourage Haitians from contemplating dangerous voyages to the US. Right. Right. Be craft was unavailable for combat, the spokesman declined what was the issue. And let me say it again, if the Haitians were a political cloud and if they were right wing, if they voted Republican most of the time, you can be demser there wouldn't be anybody being detained the way they are right now. Not one. Not a single one. In fact, the governor would have been down there with open arms and legs. Okay. Come on like a BDI Bobby Graham was, you know, it's really kind of ironic that Bob Graham is now the big hot shot on the security. The Senate intelligence committee, which in his case is an oxymoron, even though he said a lot of good stuff, you know, recently, but it's about time. But back during the Mary L days where he was down there, hey, come on down, baby. Corrigus the courageous freedom floatella. That's what he was talking about. And of course, in a meantime, for Delay, here's a couple of nice people. Here's a crook, here's a murder. Go put up all the jail's mental institutions. He picked and chose. We went through years of history and his town because of that. And did we learn? Oh, do we ever learn? Then I'm reading a paper this morning, while I'm going to be long lines on election day and the ball of this so long. Oh, they're already predicting a nightmare on Tuesday. This place is hopeless. Tom Jika. There's no need. I don't need to be here to get the feel of this. I know already. It's hopeless. This is the place where they can't do anything right. And talk about neurotic repetition. No matter how many times we can make it at the same mistake, let's try it one more time. Let's see if we can screw it up again. She can do it. Yeah. What the hell was that? What is that? Oh, that was the cue button. I was excited. What is that? I thought we had somebody under the board in there. What is it? What the fuck? What did you say? I said, I confused the stuff out of me. Do you hear what he almost just said? Almost. Yeah, and he said, shh, she, I, I, I, I don't like that. Don't start picking on the Arabs again. Okay, we didn't put them on the thing. Oh, we should have put the laundry head on there, I guess. No, don't do that. Which of these words do you think is the most offensive? 200 and some votes already. None of the above. They're just words God, damn it, 129. Nigger 52, Kike 14, Fag at 8, Lop 3 and spik only 1. Only one spik, uh, psycho. And of course I got them trained on that, you know. You think spik's like span, spik and span? Got this? No, no. You know who like span? Suds, coolman and rednecks like span. Which I never thought it says is a redneck, but it's, it's a strange thing. Here's a facts from John Merrell and Portsain, loosely, who says, you can significantly cut down the number of unsolicited phone calls you get by getting a dollar ID from the phone company and then activating an anonymous call blocking on your phone. Most of the telephone sales calls block their phone numbers from being displayed in your caller ID. That's right. And none of those calls will ring it your house after the call block is in place. So what do you do? I already have caller ID. How do you activate an anonymous call blocking on a phone? How do you do that? I'm not sure. I've never heard of that. An anonymous call blocking. Well, John and Portsain, Lucy, thank you so very much for facting me that. Now if you'll just let me know how I activate my anonymous, etc. What do you want? Here's a fact that says, what do you allow a detainee out on the street if there's a flight risk? Let's give this, this people and expediting the opportunities and expediting the opportunity to explain their intention to come to this country. If it's economically related, bond byage. It says, I see your raised money each year for causes that are important to you. Why don't I see all these hard bleeding righteous protests just stick their hands in their deep pockets or raise mine to help those in need? I'm sure they might get lucky and find somebody to help in Africa in the South America even in their backyard if they care to look. Okay, right on, whatever you said, I've no idea what it was but whatever you said. He also said book of Brian's an asshole and I said, I said, I'm so really correct. Man, that thing he sent me, it gives me chills to realize that I'm surrounded by people. I haven't got a clue where to draw any line, you know? And where there's any line. It's just like just shoot from the hip, just say a bunch of crap, you know? Just stick to the funny stuff. You're a funny guy, Brian, you look funny, you sound funny, you act funny, that wiggiest got some time to make. You're a funny little guy. Don't start being like a broadcast enough or an expert on pubic relations or some kind of a sociologist who's going to like, I just forget about that, okay? Or some kind of a internet guru leave that to Eric. Remember that's your leave it in Eric? Time 57. At 5.60 WQ, I'm in a wonderful Thursday on Halloween. It's Halloween, baby. You should see some of their freaks around this place today. I love that thing that Mohan said, you know? It was cute. I don't know exactly what it was, but it was moving around a little bit. We got the mad dog at one, Hank will be on a tree and then of course between 5 and 6. The worst hour in history being over every Thursday, but it kills a good hour of the opposite. 7 o'clock we got the big, because we couldn't find anybody else at Orlando and then of course any K from GA10. Joe and what is that? Why do we have ESPN radio overnight? Is that a mistake? Could be. That's right. This is right here Thursday night to the 6 in the morning ESPN radio is in Friday morning. Don't tell me we got another mistake in a schedule. Oh brother. I'll tell you one thing when you go to Brandeez, it's never a mistake. That's the right place to take your feet. In fact, just chop your feet off into ankles, put them in a goddamn bag and sit them over to Brandeez. They'll take good care of them. Seriously, they got the top brands in a business. The most unbeatable prices and sales who doesn't know their feet inside not what? What is that? What do you give me a look? Somebody called and said, stop making fun of Howard on this line. What on the inside line? Probably his wife. Anyway, they got rock ports, SES, Spirit, Tibola, Naturalizer and a lot more. And probably our PD Lenny's got nothing else to do down there. And with their gigantic solution, the shoes you want are in stock ready to pop on your feet. And like I told you, like I was starting to say, we've got interrupted by PD Lenny's. Have another spastic drug attack. Brandeez is open daily 9 to 9 Sundays, 10 to 5, you'll find him at 1290. North that it will highway and pop in a week. Take good care of your feet, set him over to Brandeez. And all this wicked Brandeez take 20% off on all famous men and women vote shoes. This week only at Brandeez in Prostigis, Pop-On-O. 9 and low. This is 4th Radio 560. You win 2AM. It stays. If you're planning to tell, you've heard at 560. WQA. Yeah, it's Woops hysteria. 560 WQA with 3KB Ball. Get it, hoop. Time to speed up what's up. No. It's the 3KB Ball. Go up against the Rikers Island Beach Bangers. I'm getting it, I'm getting it, hoop. I'm getting it, hoop. Get it, hoop. This B-B Ball. For Mindless Monato now free there's like you. Now, say hoops. Now take off your pants. Now grab each other. There you go. Now you're ready for your man's hero man's fantasy. 440. 560 WQA. 10-02560 WQA. You know, years ago, I just want to do a message for Miguel and the Eric. Okay. You know, that CD I was talking about doing a best of, I got emotional yesterday myself. And lost control of my senses for just a little while. I was talking about doing a best of and going through all of that working game. Look, got about it. Yeah, that's the message. Okay, you got an Eric and everybody else and Miguel. Look, got about it. Just forget about what I say. Okay, just calm down. That was wrong with you. Howard David's a bit. Speaking of that, in London, somebody just facts this to me. Britain's Navy was so alarmed by anecdotal evidence that hundreds of sailors visited mail prostitutes to three voyages in the 60s that along stay full investigation documents released Wednesday said meaning today yesterday. What they said, saying or stopped the services of mail prostitutes and lady boys. It's Singapore and Bermuda during tourism duty. But ultimately, the Navy can include it could do little to stamp out such homosexual practices because practice does make perfect. Lady boys, I'll just relax. Just listen, and you might learn something, but I doubt it. A naval document from 1969, a naval document released by Britain's pubic records office for the first time yesterday describes how sailors would hit the town in Singapore as soon as their ship docked. Not in frequently, the sends up with them sleeping with mail prostitutes who dress up very convincingly as females are read. See now you get it? Lady boys. Quite like a freaky carlos out frontally looking better, I would hope. Quite a high percentage of intelligence and could be full even once sober. How do you like that? Now, my good friend John and Portsei Lucey, I sure appreciate your facts to me back this information you only probably been about the color of block in the, it says anonymous call rejection. On star 77 off star 87. Then he writes on for one call when the other party also was call rejection activated star 82. What does that mean? See, I was understanding and telling God to that part. Off for one call when the other party also has call rejection activated star 82. You get that? No. I'm going to put this right into my hip pocket and take it home and try it. Okay, because if I could do anything to get rid of these guy damn unsolicited phone calls five to one in a morning, God damn it. I'm, I've got it in the waist pass. I'm going to put their name on you tomorrow. I've got it. It's some kind of a mortgage company. It's not a sponsor on this station. I think it's, uh, there was one that came in like a 99 o'clock last night. It facts. With their name on it, it's a mortgage place in Fort Lauderdale. And then to bottom it says, if this was sent to you an error called as toll free number, we'll get your number off the thing. Of course it was sent to me an error. I didn't solicit that mortgage companies are notoriously the worst. Well, if a man, it's what I say, screw them. I don't care who download is. It's either for a shoes or a mortgage company or our, our supplies, printers supplies, they're big on that too. Princess supplies, which by the way, we could use it around here. We're using Fax paper. I think I'm going to buy us some Fax paper, because this place is so good in cheap. We have to stay every morning. I have to send a trucky out there in a hallway to steal Fax paper for the printing or the printer out there and from power 96 to that crap down a hall every day. We've got to scrounge for Fax paper because this is such a cheap ass out, but even though they're bragging, we made money in the last quarter. Well, where now is it? Some people like to see the color of it, okay? Just take a look. Not actually hold it, just take a look at it. A lot of things are not category. I'm sure. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. And let me just take a peek. Let me hold that for a second. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. No, you need that bush to your pole. Okay, great. WQAM. No. Hey, um, what was going to happen? That is, is that him or what? I think we can do that. Wait a minute. Sir, our program, our operations better, just are working with a blonde, Halloween wig. And if, and if that is you, man, I would, I'd keep that on. You might get lucky before the hours do. You got my coat blind. Go ahead. Look at it. Oh, you want to believe this. You'd be obsessed. Contact the phone company. They can, I think they can do it permanently because I got a call around six this morning. I got a call in with the phone company and they can actually determine it. How do they do that? Uh, just call them up because I talked to someone they said just call bell south. Really? Yeah. And then wait on home for about 45 minutes and maybe I'll be lucky enough to speak to somebody at Bell South. Yeah, if they don't disconnect you first. Plus I hate Bell South anyway. They make me sick. So do I. Hey, you were talking about pop up the other day. Right. Um, I got a, uh, free software for my internet service company. I'll be happy to burn it on a disc and listen to your please. And it doesn't put anymore ads up anything like that. The only problem is this is too good. Is it there? If you go to click a link sometimes it won't open the link. If it opens up a new page. Is it the early one? Huh? Is it from Earthlink? Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's, that's not bad. Yes, I don't know. Yes, I don't know. Please. Yeah. And also, um, I have one also that's integrated into my fire wall. I use it on a long pro. And I don't have any stock in it. So I just find them very good. And also block some of your cookies and people turn to access your computer illegally. Yeah, block your cookies, man. That's what I always say. So I'll be happy to send you that pop out block. Thanks a lot. Someone can give me the address to the station. I'll burn it up a city and put up in the mail. Okay, hang on. Hang on and talk to our retruck. You got it. Okay. Okay. So some helpful people are as a fan. It says there's an easier way to step on one. What calls call the phone company asks for privacy director. It's around 16 bucks a year and all. 16 bucks a year. I'd pay a lot more than that. Instead of blocking calls, it screens all types of soliciting business calls or callers that don't allow the numbers to be shown in your caller ID. When these people try to call the privacy director in your fears and picks up for you. It'll show privacy director on your caller ID when you pick up the phone. If you, well, wait a minute. When these people try to call, does the phone ring? See, that's the thing. I don't want my phone ring. I don't want these people getting through to my number. I got an almost the number. I don't want that phone ring. And especially five to one. The guy day morning. When you pick up the phone if you choose to an automated service. We'll say privacy director. And then the person calling you will stay there. I don't want to go through that. You'll be then you'll be asked to press one to hang up to that. And now no. Absolutely positive. The answer is no. I don't want to have to go through that. I want to stop the calls. I don't want to go through a long, convoluted process. Press one if you got a big ass. Press two if you're got a crappy attitude. Press three if you love. Mohour David's a bit. Whatever. You're not going to go through that. I want to get rid of them. I'd have to go through something long convoluted process. And speaking of process, it's interesting to me that up in Toronto, which I spent several months there. And I'm stood on. I don't get any of these calls. I need to one of those places. Of course, Hampton, Amy, say, Wow, they're a little ass backward over there. Okay, well fine. That's good in that case. But in Toronto, the show is held not backward. In fact, my guide damn internet service up there. Never goes down. That for one second. That for a millisecond. So if there's so guy damn backward everywhere else, how come down here? Your damn service goes down on a time. But I never get any of these unwanted solicitations on my phone there. I'm like, how come they don't do what I'm your cell phone, by the way. So, Amy, why don't you get them on your cell phone? I'm not sure. I'm not sure why that is. Well, somebody will probably tell us. I'm almost tempted. A lot of people have gotten rid of their regular home phones. You know that? And they ask you, cell phone. I don't like that because I don't like the quality of the cell phone. And the cell phone is even if you have a real good one. They're okay sometime. Practicalism of the show. And you'll hear some bad cell phones really bad. Hopefully it'll get to the point where it's the technology's good enough that that's all we'll have. Yeah, that's all we'll have a cell phone. I was driving to work this morning. There was some much parts of broad in there next to me. And she was, but that's not on a cell phone. I looked over there and she's weaving on the road. And it's just what we need. Oh, look at this. Goiom. This is good. Goiom is good. All of the goiom. They don't know what that means. They know what they are, but they don't know what it means. Just like Schwarzer. Well, Schwarzer is not a Schwarzen German means black. Yenish and German. Schwarzer just means black. When you're in Germany, you see that word all the time. So what's the big deal with that? It just means black. How can you talk about it? All depends on the usage if you say, oh, look at that. Dumb Schwarzer over there. That's offensive man. You're picking on some poor dark guy. Maybe he is dumb, but I mean, but what is that? What they don't understand. They take us in insults. Well, you know something. If you're going to have a chip on your shoulder all your life, you're going to get offended a lot. That's my comment about that. If you want to be offended in this world, no problem at all. If you got a sense of humor, if you just take things and strive, if you don't give a flying crap anyway, you're going to have to be a little bit more careful. That's what the Polish woman, 62 poor, 4% say, not only is words a fine offensive, they're just words. 161 on 258 say, Fufangula. Oh, how about that one? How about if you? Nigger 66, Kijk 16, Faggot 9. I do like to sound of that though. Faggot. I do like that. Wop for and spick now too. Double our pleasure with the spicks too. Ruck to appear.

You'll even stop there with them. Do no,bury birds, who want to go over the base of this moron? No, no, no, no you don't. Now you stand here a little heavy, you are hitting my hips. down, green demon. Oh no, he's not a guy. He's a fucking fool. He's a fucking fool. Oh the sea, run behind him. Run behind him. Where your boys on those? 1017 at 560 WCM. Don't forget join George Volkabryne. In fact, when you see Volkabryne, you'll see Volkabryne, you'll see Volkabryne. Oh, now I don't want to be pretty interesting. Are you dressing up for that occasion? I'm going to do a Halloween thing. Why not? You're going to be left out. You're going to be left out. So how did I look with that blonde wig on? That was great. I felt lovely. I felt like a new girl. It was incredible. We got this blonde wig that's being passed around and building. Miguel started out with him. And Miguel went, oh, that is him. Is that him or what? Of course, it's kind of a telltale thing with a black, a push. He got a curckel beard. Yeah, look what happened to him. Through it. He looks okay with that. And then Muff was in here with that thing on and that. He was the he looked the best of anybody that was definitely him. He's going to be taking that a little later on. I can't tell you where. But if Jeff loses to McBride, it says, W. will do more for Florida because it'll be a wake-up call for his own election in 2004. Since Florida's vital to him. Oh, yeah, he went and Florida again. I forgot about that. We got we got DBS plans to take care of that. You know what I mean? DBS plans would quotes around to that. You know, they're playing those spots. I mean, you must have seen it by now. The McBride spot where they play the clips off of that tape. Yeah. I know. And how is it possible that people are hearing them say these things? And it's like, uh, oh, we didn't hear it. We didn't know what you're talking about. He said that. Now we don't think he said it was just kidding. How is that possible? You ask holes if they heard in the Sun Sentinel. How is that freaking possible if him didn't work up again? That's because I'm hearing it's bad. I shouldn't be here Tom. A little time he jickie your wrong time. I shouldn't be here. It's bad for my health. It's enough to drive you nuts. And if you think that's enough to drive it. I've got to see all the facts. I'm getting out about the phone thing. This guy says this and somebody else says that. And I mean, but I'm still not what they'll do. Well, somebody called and said that the privacy director from Bell South is probably the best thing that it takes care of almost everything. Well, Gary says the guy explained it wrong. Your phone doesn't ring unless the caller leaves a message. That facts that woke you up. We're never gotten through. Uh, okay. The phone doesn't ring unless the caller leaves a message. And then if you pick it up, then you go through the choice. Do you want to speak to them? Are they, uh, a grave robber? They want your money. Is it, Edmund, man? With 10 million dollars, et cetera. Is it mid church wants to give you all your money back? No. I don't think so. You want to give me a something I money back, huh? But with that, no, we're coming out of the caller. I think it's speaking of a mid church. Give me my money back. I got a good message for my good friend Jeff Rima. Great. Cool. And even the Panthers again last night, boys. Pretty sad. No shots in the third period. They get out shots 700 to well, like 13. And they still win a game in overtime. Thanks to the fact that Tercot decided to take a walk wanderer on her. And overtime. Hey, I'm over here in the corner. All the bucks into that games over. Hey, but I'm over here in the corner games over. See ya. It was the Terc. So let's go. Anyway, if you call someone to get recorded message in the, uh, the person you are calling is chosen out to accept calls that the block their phone numbers from being displayed on a caller ID, you'll need to dial star 82 for your call to go through for them. What? Star 77 turns it on permanently until you turn off with a star 87. Uh, want to put this in my pocket. I'm just going to, uh, punch all kinds of buttons on here. What I'm going to do is take the guy down phone all of them and stuck into bottom of my pool is what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to do. I'm not exaggerating. Seven on Tuesday and 11 yesterday. 7 11. Maybe it's an moment. Maybe it should go down to 7 11 got a big goal. But 11 and then one at five to one in the guy down morning. Tomorrow. Tomorrow remind me before I leave tomorrow. I'm going to bring in that thanks from that. And these people need to be exposed. Yes. Every one of them. These people that are doing this, I'll put them on the year because this is absolutely unacceptably bugging people and. And it's nothing now. It used to be like, you know, after six, it was almost in her six at night. Now eight 15 in a morning, 7 39 a clock 10 o'clock at night. And now a brand new a load 12 55 in a morning. Whether that was you should only croak. Okay. And I want you to take it personally, but you should only die a wicked dead. Come on. Come on. I'm about five to one in the guy day morning. The first part of offensive is Graham offensive. Okay. Answers, schvarts is the new trillion is term for black, including the person. There are other derogatory terms some borrowed from English, but there are Jews who can make schvarts offensive. However, even though the meaning of the term is no offensive, that doesn't mean that the word has an as required in offensive. Well, that's fine. Like I said, you can use any word anyway you want. Goi is the standard Hebrew term for non-Jew. Plurled Goiim. Adjective Goiisha. Like this place. Goiisha. Even though we got a lot of Jews right here still a Goiisha place. Literally it's the Hebrew for nation. Spoken allow them to discuss it in flesh if it's projurter. So is the word Jew and similar to Adem Jew that damn Goi. But it's actually damn Goi's dumb guy. See, I'm giving the education here. Dumb guy. Well, that's kind of redundant. Better to say Gentile or non-Jew when writing an English for a multi-religious audience such as S. S.C.J. What is that? What is this from? S.C.J. In general, the use of judgmental or projurter terms even if no offense is intended should be avoided. They only serve to win site anger and side-track the conversation. So it's like etiquette. In the phrase, Shavas Goi, a Gentile who does things for Jews on Shavas, it is neutral. Yet when refusing to do something for someone by saying, I'm not your Shavas Goi. It carries it in derogatory tinge. So what else is like, that's like house nigger in it. How smoothly? Like that the kind of lees of thing? Oh, we better not play that again. Are we better play that? Yes. Some also suggest avoiding the term Marano which means pig. But language is that. Looks like Spanish to me. How do you say pig in Spanish? Settle? Rosie? Depending on the intended meaning the term Sephardic or crypto do you are more well? Too much of this Jew talk. Okay, there's like 10 Jews in the world. We got a spin half the show talking Jew talk? 295 none of them are listening to this show. 295 votes of separate factor. Which of these words do you think is most offensive? None of the above. They're just words 181. Nigger is 79. Pike 17. Fag it. 11. Oh, I don't I say that well. Fag it. 11. Walk forward and speak three. And that's it. But if you over was over 60% of the people in this audience. At least I'm sure enough to realize that it's just a bunch of words. Guess what else somebody facts me? They would find sensational. And let me say it again. The origins and that song. The book Nigger, the strange career of a troublesome word by Randall Kennedy, a black professor, was interviewed on everyone of the talking head channels. And I'm sure you people at Fox News had them on several months ago. But all takes something and twisted around and turn it. See because this is what the right one is. Is it if we got some influence on the show and have any influence? What's the point? Are you really that paranoid? That psychotic? Yes. Yeah, you're right. So look at all the people who died from Godfather. Godfather, actors who've died. What a list. Great. Let's take a call or do. WQIM. Yes sir. A couple of quick things. Then a spy report of fuel indulgment. Go right in. I don't know who's the bigger genius. Bokeb Ryan for making the mobets. Or are you providing a way to enter people enough to tune into that awful morning show? Could I find myself tune in and just to find out what he's going to be parodying. Yeah. I keep telling him I'm building him in awe. I don't really tell him. Like this morning, what he called, I'm just waiting for the bit where he's the person to skip for now. I'm getting pounded. Yeah. And the fire reports, not that you care. But the maggots of the midday were blowing off yesterday. How they beat you by appointing the summer book in Palm Beach. They didn't beat me. I wasn't on the way. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. They beat me in Palm Beach. Yeah. I mean, you don't care because it's not even your- More than even in that market. Plus I was nonmost of the summer book. It was George. So that's quite an accomplishment. They beat him by George by one point in their market. That's pretty heavy duty. Yeah. They beat you by a woppy. I'm sure they'll impress that chronic radio-off facture. That's always spashing me all this inside crap. Who thinks those guys are God on wheels, you know. Oh, they're awful. That's why I listen to you through the static, my friend. Thanks. Thank God for your win. And I say take them off and put us on up there. I would love that. Matter of fact, I'm the one that started that rumors. They got the lady to back you last week. But he keep it up. All right. You start enough rumors sooner than the lady they come true. Now I'm hoping. I've heard most leaving. Have a great day, Quail. Bye. I just started that rumor right now. We don't want motor leave. We've, in fact, if we have more ever left, we wouldn't have like a human punch in bag around here. But in the building enjoys that a lot. It's not personal, though. It is. So look at all these Godfather actors who died, sterling Hayden McCluskey. Remember McCluskey? Stand him off straight. John Cousel, he was afraid of. I forgot he died. He died from brain cancer. I'm smart. Now I get everybody says, dumb. I'm smart. I want to respect. And he's flops back in the chair. And Michael says, I don't ever want to see you. When you visit our mother, I want seven years advanced notice. I don't want to be with you. I don't want to know about you. I don't want to know from you. Frateau. You broke my heart. Then he goes and tells Al Niri. I don't want anything to happen to him while our mother is still alive. Michael Gatso. How do you say that? Cutsel? Michael Gatso. Frateau, Frateau, Frateau, Frateau, Frateau, Frateau, Frateau, Frateau. That's it. I loved him. He was one of my favorite people in the whole movie. Frateau, Michael Corley, only said this. Michael Corley, only said this. That's it, sure. Sure. I just made it all up as all lies. I think that was great. What is sitting next to his brother? Yeah. It was between the brothers K. His brother, what that look on his face. What that funky cap, you know. But you cared about identifying this gentleman over here. That was just great. Not that anybody doesn't like Godfather. That's our message to you. Okay, you get the QAM Raspberry. What is that? Heather from Fox News? Heather? I knew. Can you hang out on him in it? Yeah, sure. Because I got to do my break and I don't want to cut you short. Okay. Somebody already did that to me at birth. Hang on, Heather. Okay. That was a joke. You hear her laugh now. Well, that's Fox Day. I have no sense of humor. 1027 at 560. What do you want to find? I have a lot of advice. A little joke. Somebody coming. Share. Hey, if you've been cut short on top. You know, when you go to the barberset, a little off the top. If somebody got carried away in a lot off the top, if your ball is a walking bowling ball, get your hair back from Chuck Alphay, or he's been helping the famous and not so famous looked their best for over 25 years. With this sensational great-looking natural hairline system. And boy, lately we've been talking a lot about bad hair pieces. Because there's so many of them. I was on with Wolf Blitz and Blitz Green yesterday in my channel surfing, who Sam Donaldson. He's got a new gray piece that kind of sits off the one side. I mean, get serious. Some of you silly people. Aaron Brown makes him look good. Anyway, pick up the phone and call Charles Alphay. Ray 1-800-321-2413. And if you mention the arragis, I'll knock two and a bucks off the regular price. That's right. Charles Alphay also services and repairs all kinds of hair systems. Why do you wait for only 25 to 30 bucks? And like I keep telling you guys, you're going to look better when younger than you ever thought because this is a natural hairline system. It looks like they were going right out of your scalp. Instead of some silly piece like we were just passing around in here, which was a joke. So if you want people laugh and act, you go someplace else. If you want to look great, call Charlie. 1-800-321-2413, or log onto their website, CharlesAlphayerry.com. We're sports-winny-056. Do you, A.F. To the more on-hour at night at Clockyle here more. Thank you. Thanks, Mo. Okay, here's Heather from Fox News. Hi, Neil. How are you? I'm okay, I think. Thanks for taking her call. We've been trying to reach you for the past couple days. I tried to reach me. You've called people I haven't been in vetid yet. You've called dead relatives of mine. What's the story, Heather? We're working on a story about the CD you're promoting on your website. Yes. I won't say it. And word. Heather, are you listening to the show? Yes, I am. I've been listening to it a couple days. And just so you know, we're going to continue. Did you hear me go through the entire rationale of what that song had nothing to do with Kindle's Arise? What about the song, Kindle's A Kindle's A Kindle's A? That has that well, that's obviously about Kindle's A. And I just want to know why you're playing this on your show. No, I see. I'd like to know why. This is really interesting. Why are you calling me? Ask me why I should play this. We make we have some periods about built-clinton dozens of them. Nobody ever complained about that. We have some periods about Al Gore dozens of them. Nobody ever complained about those. Well, African American folks up here in New York are pretty offended by it. But you know what, wait, let me say this to you, Karen. We're not in New York. Uh-huh. Okay. We don't broadcast in New York. We're on WQM in Miami. And the fact that the matter is done on let us, except for people like you and the people at that right-wing Newsmax.com will want to make a big sentence about this. If it weren't for that, they wouldn't even be aware that we exist. Okay. This organization that's offended by it is a national organization. But the fact that the matter is we've been playing these songs for many, many, many months. We've never had one single complaint. And when interlopers like you from outside, like from Fox News, are from some right-wing website, want to tell us what, I mean, for you to ask me how come you're playing that because we want to play it. I think Neville, what's the value? What is it, what is it, what do you do for you? What is it called? It's called comedy. That's what it's called. Do you have a sense of humor? Do you think it's funny to call it the call? Conalisa, right? In a dick, in a dick, in a dick, well, Harry Bellafonte, called her the house Negro. Okay, so we'll call her whatever we want. But this is a little bit different. No, no, it's not that. You would take an issue with some- It's not the least bit different. She is the house Negro. See, you people at Fox may not understand this. Not everybody in the world is the right-winger like Rupert Murdoch. There actually are those of us who are progressive or moderate liberal. Whatever we are, who also have the right to speak to express whatever we want. So, if we're paying again what you just said for me there. You think she is the what? She's the house Negro. Aha. And you don't find anything wrong with that. Well, what do you mean wrong with it? It's a fact that's my opinion. Am I entitled to my opinion? I'm here, you're certainly entitled to your opinion. And that's basically what Harry Bellafonte said as well. Obviously, this is why nobody returned your calls. Whatever your name is. Because we knew that you were trying to stir up a bunch of crap and take something out of context when I asked you. I don't think that anything being like that. Did you listen? Did you listen? We're not doing that. We're not doing that. I'll probably show you. It's my show and I'm not going to have you scream over me. You're trying to out talk me. It's not going to work. Okay. You know, I asked you in the beginning of the conversation, which I was very common. I asked you, did you hear me explain the origin of that song, the rest of Tussan song. The fact of the matter is, and I don't I'm sure he must have been on your channel. Randall Kennedy, the black author who wrote the book, Nigger the Strange, Career of a Trouble Samward. Not that I'm aware of. Well, he was certainly on CNN. He was on MSNBC. Maybe he was on Fox because he wasn't out. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't. We're not aware of it. Oh, he. We all have had questions for you. Are you aware of that book? You portray yourself to be this sort of liberal voice. But yet you're. I don't portray. I don't put labels on me. I'm I'm for example. Okay. When you're up there. I come myself a human being. You see, you people on Fox. It's this old liberal and a conservative. That's stuff when I would high button shoes. I'm thinking. I'm thinking. Living and breathing. I'm thinking. In addition to why do I have to end Miami Florida answer to some assholes in New York on Fox News. How I do my show. What is it your business? There are a lot of people who can. There are people in Miami. They care about this too. Who are they? Who are they? Name me one person. Miami is concerned about it. But we know down there certainly. Name me one. Name me one. Name me one. It's offensive. Man. Man. One. Name me one. I don't care what you say. We don't like. We don't like. I don't care. I don't care what you say. We don't like. We're calling her whatever we feel like. Conor she's a public god damn figure. And blow it out your right wing ass and you and Bill. And by way of rally didn't make the number. You are. Under these are. Consolisa. She's from New. With your fucking yellow. Keep so far apart. Conor he's a. Conor he's a. What you be doing. If you're. As just like that. Proganch. What's the stop. If you say. Because you are. I don't. If you. If you. If you. Black. And. Name. Who. This. Because they. He. Are you. Haha. You're. But yon. True. Nor. The.ard. What has bavoo? The cuisine, the toilet, and then scrub the floor. There you go, with sandals, garlic leaves. Your coat, keep going, they'll make them warm, rich and pure. You're not being naked, but you slide, it'll be very cold. If you feel what you feel, that's all you can do. When they while you be faking fat aches, maybe like. That they dreamt you just like your ester-roll. That when your head will move from side to side, from the liver. And to bush and from here, they'll be crackle asshole. Just unbelievable 22 till 11. So glad we took that call from Heather. And what did I tell you? Have I been saying that? She had that number. For like days and days, what business is it of you fascist that Fox News, can be telling us what to be playing on your mind or any other place, and then in New York for that matter. You also call up Howard Stern and tell him what to tell us about in everybody else in I'mus. Everybody else on here in New York, what the hell is it your business? In addition to which all this business about balanced and fair, like I said, all fascism all day, unbalanced unfair, all spin. She's given me this impassioned defense economy. If you like Condoleezza Rice, great, I have no respect for her. She can be one of the most educated bitches on the face of the earth, but the fact that the matter is, the articles I've read about her. The Chevron Queen, the Begg Oil Queen, just like all the other people in this administration, see, I hate to break the news dear Heather, but this is still the US of ay. I realize that you and your ilk would like to eliminate all future elections and just have a right wing kingdom. None of us want to live in it. Most of us don't want to live in that kind of country, okay? And every time she was, she must be at the cycle of villas spin and all rally. Don't confuse me with the facts. Oh, there's a lot of people down here upset about it. Well, name me one. But we have, we have, we have, we have one. Couldn't do it. She's filibustering. And then before you know, she hears the dial tone. I'm amazed I left her on that long to be honest with you. She's giving me a lecture on what I'm going to do on the new Roger show, and people in New York are upset about it. How to help the people in New York know about it? We have people in New York, listen to God damn website, do we ever had anybody complain about it? No. No. Not one. You see, I hate to break the news deal, but it's still legal not to like condolize a or the president or even John Ascroff. Hi, and hello. This is sports when you're 50 years old. You weigh yeah. Hi, this is G Gordon Lydia. And they don't come anywhere, spend meal, Rogers. Coffee cups, peanuts and slurbs were siffin. Tuckle bell wrappers and KFC chicken. Roadmaps and oats, nuts and oats, he cans. The special things that you'll find in white vans. Aschers and matches and crumps from a pastry, have eaten big macks filled milk on a post-ree. Shio's he's smeared with the raspberry jam. The special things that you'll find in white vans. If you see these populace, they've got their in man. This leaves all just some of the suspicious things, the mostly within white vans. That was classic, baby. That was just exactly what I thought it would be. Like I said, she starts out real sweet and friendly, and then she gives me like a grilling like I'm on a witness stand here in Terrigating Me. We don't have to answer to you, and we don't have to like condolese or George W. Bush, around Gore or Julie, but remember anybody else. It's a radio show, and also it's a comedy show. It's like 35% to content and 65% last. That's what it is. And she's giving me a lecture from New York. She's giving me a song of dance about what we should be doing on the year. And a lot of people are upset. But I got news for her honey. I'm not a host for to be calling here a QAM and telling us what we ought to be able to do on here. And talk about a sense of humor. Can't complain about her. She don't have one. You find that funny? She reminds me that the Joe Peshie thing. You think that's f and funny? Yeah, that's what reminds me of. Does that amuse yous? Yeah, to me is a zuss. We think it's hysterical, okay? Everybody else thinks it's pretty good. I just asked our program director if we had one complaint from anybody about condolese. No, not one. Not a whisper. Not a whisper. Not a whisper. Not anybody. The Chevron Queen is not one of my favorite people, okay? And she's just a subject being a public figure of very public figure to be in a may that may Fun of having parody, sung about her as Bill Clinton. We never had a call from Fox about Bill cigar Monica's vagina or the other 8,000 Bill Thin songs we played around gole, a gole with a coal miners, which I think is hysterical. See, we got a sense of humor about all of it. We're not just political ideologues. No much he starts giving me. Well, where are you supposed to be liberal? No, I'm not. I'm supposed to be Neil Rogers. I don't like take opinions out of like a book somewhere up a file card. Well, let's see. I'm liberal. So what do I think about this? I'm for a capital punishment in this country because it's a barbaric place. Does that make me liberal? No, I'm for strong immigration of controls. Does that make me liberal hardly? Put me right in league with Pef, you can. I'm for what makes sense. But you people have fostered understand that with all your contrived, and it he and coms, and the right against the left. See, you put a few token, the so-called lefties on air, softball people, to be tokens. To be on air with all your right wing fanatics, and that's your idea of a goddamn network. Okay, we're per Murdoch ain't full of anybody with a brain. Anybody. A bunch of silly housewives over the age of 60, and they're sitting there watching their food with their transfixed. The left over Ditto heads. The people that can't find rush. Oh, man, that was one of the most astonishing things. I mean, I figured I knew where they were coming from, but just so psychotic about it is if to say, how can you be saying these things? You think it's funny? Yes? Because I have a sense of humor. We got all kinds of purity songs about me. Don't bother me? Lighten up a little bit, honey. You'll live a lot longer than where you'll be a lot happier in life. But what did I tell you about, Fox? They just, you know, we've had other people come out of the closet including me on a show. We just had Fox come out of the closet, right here on the Neil Rogers show. Any pretence that they're trying to give to you about fair and objective and balance, I mean, you have to laugh at that, it's such a joke. The right wing, the fascist news network, that's exactly what Fox is all about. Make no mistake about it. And like I said, or if Harry, a valiphonic in horror or the house Negro, what's wrong with somebody doing a song period? It basically is the same thing. And a business about her in Chevron, we didn't just make that up. It's true. She's one of the oil queens. Just like you got the world kings in there to kings in the queens, the hark in oil people and the hell of Burton people. And it's what it's all about. And you see, this should be a good lesson to those of you people out there who don't understand what's happening in this country, the chilling or free speech, just like we took the thing off the website. Thanks to people like her and others who now make death threats. Thanks a lot, Heather. Thanks so much. Well, the people in the New York are upset. How can they be upset? They don't hear it. They don't hear it. And I got news for you. Last time I checked Al Gore, one New York state in New York City by millions and millions of votes. Okay. And the dark folks up there in New York just like the ones down here, they didn't vote for Condalisa or her mentor, very few of them. And they're not going to vote for his brother this time either on Tuesday. Soon keep rambling and carrying out the her her conversation was like something like from a mental institution really. She reminds me of those those right wing conspirator lives to probably bring up the builder burgers the trial animal commission. That'll be next. Hey, listen, Heather, call me once a week. Okay. We'll make a regular feature on the show. And you can continue trying to get on your soap box and fuck up filibuster. And I'll answer any questions and I'll cut you off. It'll be great every week. Get an 90 sure. We'll promote it in the newspapers. We'll put up billboards. You're trying to do a story because you don't like the politics of it, not because you don't like the words. Not that you give a crap about dark folks. She got a couple of darkies on your channel to be not very many. Not too many. And let me say it again that this business about this immigration policy with the Haitians. The Bush people just made it up and they're not going to tell anybody why or when or how it's just they're just doing it. Just the way it is as they see in the Irish as they are just like this. Here's a for lottery. Hello. Yes sir. You are one of the greatest debaters in the history of the world. Well, I was that mean it was like the baiting a dead frog. I mean, I was piece of cake. She's she's nothing to say. You destroy her. I mean, what is in the York have to do with here? Yeah. And I asked her. Well, give me some names of people down here. I said because we're out here. From can't give me one name. Can't even make up a name. She could have said like John Williams, you know, she could make up a name. You know what you're reminding them like when it's sometimes I think they did an awesome power thing and one person didn't like the language of the toy and the story moved the toy because one person complains. Yeah. It's a but the reason I call was the Haitians thing. Did you watch it in the news? Those people dancing around. Yes, I did. You mean at the I and S building? Yes. I thought it was just dancing around. They were like throwing themselves on the ground. There's some of the more psychotic. I thought it was a sequel to the extra sister. So I'm just letting her out. Oh, you're going to get Heather up. Sit down. And not only do you have your laugh at the same time. Okay. Don't be laughing because that means I think it's funny. Okay. One quick question. You know, my opinion is because it really wasn't on your pole, but I have no problem with the people coming in. But why do they have to stay in South Florida? We're so overcrowded. There's millions of places where they can go around this country to get a job and earn a living and be good productive person. Yeah. It's just too darn crowded down here. Not just down here. We just have too many people all over the country are unemployed. We got too many economic problems. And do we just can you have to have controlled immigration? You can't just let people this this what foot drive would insanity that they started with Cuban. And it doesn't make any sense. You can't do that. This country, I mean, can we help 80 a little bit? I mean, it's a really it's terrible. And I want to we do not help in the people. They're what we did was help. You know, they're corrupt. Yeah, I rest day. We put the former priest. We put him in here again so we can prop him up and control him. We do it all over the world. Then we have to suffer the consequences. When we all keep up those debates, go to the greatest. Here's a facts from Richard and Carl Springs. I'm simply amazed at the phone call you took this morning from the alleged reporter Fox News. One more time. It's a proven fact that the administration is supported by neo Nazi fascist pigs who try to impose their own views on life and others in this world. This is a free world and a partial comedy show for Monsake. Question, who the hell are people to decide what you do and do not discuss on your show? I've never ceased to be amazed that people out there bitch moan grown about the content of your show but contendless in every day. I mean, the idea that somehow I'm just interjecting my own comedy. The idea that somebody is calling me from Fox News in New York to give me a lecture on what I'm doing here on his show. You must have a lot of time on your hands honey. Like I said with all the stuff about the sniper who's going to try him who's going to do this and and the election coming up to the on Tuesday and all these murders and here's a side of my screen again on CNN. And when I asked her about that, the black author, the black professor that wrote that book, which was called what that was the name of the guy. I got to hear some more. I try to get my facts in front of me. So I know what I'm talking about. I like the people on your channel who just talking glittering generalities always throughout a bunch of statistics, which are wrong. Randall Kennedy, nigger the strange career of a troublesome word. And that was his whole point. Would you understand honey? Because you got no sense of humor and that whole rap about well, are you where are you? You're supposed to be a liberal. That's the whole thing. Who are that fat and your Sullivan are trying to point out, you know, oh, here's a guy who claims to be a liberal, but he's, you know, making all these racist remarks. I'm racist only in a fact that I feel very, very sad that so many black people in this country are uneducated. And that we've made it, we've made it socially acceptable for us so we can laugh at black people to be acts acts me a question on us other crap to be talking in boobonics. That's how I'm racist. Not because I don't like black people or because black people are inferior. In fact, I got news for a header. We know plenty of black people are a lot more educated than you are. And probably could do a hell of a lot better debate. And not a single lot of them, by the way, is called in complaint about Condor Lita or about the rest of the tuition song. Guess a darky good morning. Oh, I'm sorry that I say the inward. Anyway, it goes on to say Richard Dick. He says obviously people had had no lives, nothing to do with their lives. They, they do some uncle, they don't make their pathetic, pedantic lies meaningful for a few hours a day. Please, I implore you to not take phone calls from people any longer on your show. Those of us who are educated have ascended the world around us, followed the world, advances they unfold and more importantly enjoy your brand of programming. Can not be subjected to the uneducated foolish, typical mommy's style fascist to call in your show. Frankly, people who have nothing to say, they should be never allowed on your program. When you return to the former program and screw times at the worst comments, we the educated of the world will be most gratified. Keep up the great daily rent. Dick and cross-fring second Dick. Always like Dick. Oh, by the way, I want to discuss that with Heather. She could take that a context too. A screen text. A screen you had there. That's my comment to you. I'll appear in New York. We're pretty. I mean, just stop and think about what she's saying. This is a woman is calling from a major supposed news network. And she's telling a broadcaster on the air in this country. I've been on the air for like 26 years in this market. She's calling for me instructions on how I should feel about kind of Lisa. Okay, squab kind of Lisa. That's what I say. Screw John Ashcroft and all these goddamn Neo fascist okay scroll all. I'm not gonna go step to make you happy. And all your damn fascist of an airport Murdoch alleged news make believe news. Make a big story about it honey make a big fat story about it. Give us 50 million dollars worth of publicity. Who gives a crap? I like I said you must really be desperate running out of material. And of course if I was like Mr. Oralee Mr. Hachat and I even dropped in a goddamn rating book. Not even not even a point one. Not a point one. Larass has got an 8.2 in them and a month of September this bill or Riley show is he have any number. No, he's got a number already. A big oh he's the big oh. He's got the same number as Norma Kent. How do you like that? If I had the same number on here as Norma Kent, I would tell me I don't belong on a year. That's what it would tell me. Oh, I've tied if she's just crazy person. Heather you're a crazy person and have a nice day. Ante I will still mailing featured RIP tombstone. You they held it up last night on crossfire. A piece of literature attacking Senator Paul Wallstone support of the estate tax featured a large tombstone and letters RIP was mass mail last week by a lobby group for small businesses. The double sided mailing from the National Federation of Independent Business carries an e-reel illustration of a tilted tombstone beside an open burial vault illuminated by a full moon. On the flip side, the mailing urges recipients to tell Paul Wallstone is votes are killing you. The copy also says Paul Wallstone's taxes can even reach you in the grave. Yeah, they held it up like I said on crossfire last night. James Carbillard was out of control last night and realized he was like borderline illiterate. You know how they put up quotes and he was reading it. There was I forget what the word was he he not the brightest guy. I mean he's great on the areas it was a wild man last night just ripping at little I almost ripped the vote I often idiot. That Tucker rhymes with smucker. Okay, now I tell you what Heather what we're gonna do is you and your rubber merdock bill don't commute. Excuse me with a factor while you the spin-myster. Auduity it's up there make a list of what we can do on a show on mail it to us okay, maybe email it to us. So we know what we can do and the do's in don'ts. My and local your sports video 560's you a yeah. Holy mac and on this is Joe Bow on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God.

Until we had the evidence. Here's what it says that was priceless please put that conversation on a CD. Cheryl. Oh thank you Cheryl. She said it was priceless. Hundred bucks for you honey. Here's what it says yes F. F. A. U. X. Fox Fox News. And happy birthday. Thank you. Yeah. Heather didn't even wish me happy birthday in the middle of her die tribe. Well screw you honey. Called us highly rated importance. You know what they're upset about? You know what they're trying to do now. They're trying to stir up big thing with me so they can whip it up on a ryley so we can get some the lit people tuning in to him. He's going to start a radio war. It's kind of hard to start a radio war. Bill when you don't have any audience. That's probably why the when you're out of station. It's got like eight watts with the tower that's sticking about four feet up and here like the light bulb. That's why we called it the light bulb. Okay now it's not even now the signal so we could not even like the burnout light bulb. That's what they're looking to do. And there I knew there had to be more to it than this. See because he's making no impact in his market whatsoever and rushes getting bigger and bigger. I'm saying honey you can tell uh tell uh Bill for us. He ain't no rush. He ain't no rush. Rush good squash him with one cheek. He would flip him off like the side of the the side of his forehead like a net. Like those lights that are running around on my gills head. That's what the that's it. He said he cut a light or something. A bed bugs from you from Pune, we gone. 560, 560, 560, 560, 560, 560. I guess we've been putting our place right? You betcha! We've been putting our place. You better not be picking on those uh the administration okay? Because now you're un-American. And we hear you we thought you were pretend to be a liberal. I'm just pretending to be me okay just a guy. They pay me to give my opinions. Not liberal opinions, not conservative opinions, not reactionary opinions, not communist opinions. Just need a Rogers opinions okay? If you're too stupid to understand that header, well make you'll draw your diaphragm. Maybe we'll explain it to you. And you know what? You can put a story on it's going to last an hour and a half on there. And it's still I can get a many numbers in this market. He's still going to have a big fan. Ah! Zero. That's for it. WKOM. Yes sir. Hey it's over monkey man. How you doing? Okay. That phone call was sensational. I was squeezing it the whole time. Where? She was squeezing her still if he asked me. She was unbelievable. Anyways, I got a few things for you. First off, I love the restitution song. I crank it up as loud as I can every time I hear it. Do not do not cut it from the CD Neoledits. They are on there and be cast around millions of copies. You know something, I'm not even getting involved in that CD. I have one of my hand right now in the CD track. I'm not getting involved because I'm so disgusted with the way the whole thing's been this handled. And nobody would listen to me. I know where she was coming from. I've been around a block a few times. I tried to tell these people, just paying attention or don't return to calls. Don't speak to her. And I'm glad I put her on here. So we could bring her out of her fashes clause. Me too. I'm glad you let her talk and make an acid herself. But seriously, I leave it on the CD. I think I'm going to copy. Number two. As far as the poll, they are just worth. And I got a quick story for you. Another train monkey. Right. I was up in Naples doing a gig with the monkey a few months ago. And anyways, this big redneck and this big pickup truck cuts me off. So I go around them, right? Got pissed off. I guess he screams out. You've faggot. Anyways, that didn't bother me to show the ignorance. Yeah, that's that. Well, I would flip my monkey out of him if I were you. I didn't have them with me at the time. They were the hotel, but yeah. Well, strap one on. Uh, anyways, one more thing. We got a big black one here with a loony. Yeah? Nice. I shouldn't have said that. A big black one now. I'll have a little set again. Oh, it's just a rubber thing. Okay. It's a rubber instrument. Maybe if you could use it a while. You might loosen up your attitude a little bit. Loosen up something. Definitely. Neo, you're wonderful. Okay. Do you have any idea of bokeh's going to have any CDs tonight? Uh, oh yeah, he's going to have a trash rye. Maybe you can pick one up there. Maybe he'll bring you a bootleg. That would be great. That would be great. Ever great day. All right, Neo, bye. Yes, he's going to bring some of the funny issue. I mentioned they're going to bring him my bootleg one. Yo, I'm almost happy to play that again. And I will. Here's a fact that says give him hell. No, this is our but-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-Fin. Right on, baby. Right on. Some outsider from some fascist never can hear a call and up a-I mean this is amazing. So like I said, I finally-I'm a little slow. Finally see through it. Just desperately try to like you goose up some numbers in this market. And couldn't happen. Ain't going to happen. I'm going to tell you the right wingers between noon and two. And yes, I'm on for one of those hours and mad dogs. I'm from one to two. We're still doing just fine here. But the right wingers, the people who want to hear that particular rap, and particular stuff. They're tuning into rush. Okay. They don't need a little league rush when they got the real rush. Okay. And then the rest of us over here were like, we're sniffing rush. Right on the bottle. Mastie small and stuff. Oh, it's speaking of rap. You saw the stir-rap or jam, Master J. Run the MC shot and killed. Now the right gun story. Why did gun not sound through your gun squeezers? Very sad. Jam, Master J. Part of the pioneering rap trio Run the MC was shot and killed yesterday. The group's publicists said. Publices Tracy Miller confirmed that the 37 year old rapper was real name was Jason Mysell. A legal source who spoke of courses everybody does on condition of anonymity. So the rapper was shot in the head at the recording studio in New York City, Burrow, Queen's. A second person was shot in the ankle and the shooter was at large source said, Run the MC is widely credited with helping bring hip hop and a music's mainstream, including the group's smash collaboration with Aerospace and the 80's standard walk this way. And why did the quitted with bringing a resurrect to Aerospace career? I should have pointed out. How do you like that? So they couldn't have been all bad. In fact, I remember when Howard used to be fun, I'm not talking about our hard sperm. He had them on his guest when I think was one of the first times anybody who was sent me some old Howard sperm tapes back in the mid 80's. One of the funniest shows I've ever heard in my life, just unbelievable. And some of my chick calls and I want to know, who's got the biggest long in the group? And Howard says, now we're talking, now we're getting down to, yeah, now we're talking. Get some good calls. I think he had a point. It was an old bit of things to come. I think I got a call of power on it and ask him, how come he's saying the thing, how come all that dyke talk on here there, huh? Unless all you write wingers out there unless you have a lot of dikes too, could be. 11 after 11 at 560 WQA, let me tell you, if you're not getting a good night's sleep, life isn't worth a crap, your back doesn't feel good, you feel like hell.

You never said, I've been here. Get your finger out of the honey. On Newly the country leaves a different movie. Oh, with your fucking yellow teeth so far apart.

That's a dream you just black your ester role. That's when you hit, we'll move from chat to chat, from the leaves. It's your pleasure from it, David Crackham asshole. I've been 17 at 5.60. I listen to that again very carefully. I find anything offensive about it. We don't like Kotterlitho. She goes into this impassioned song. She's highly educated. She's screaming and shouting at my radio show. I have to agree with her. I'm going to come around who's a right-wing view of life. I guess what's we heard? That is never going to happen. It's only one of two things. Either you're as dumb as I think you are based on that call or number two. I was right, that somebody on your network is desperate to try to get a number in this market. It's going to happen. See, it didn't work when they tried to get me to put them on the show. Or they invited me to be on his show. So I could be like fodder for his crap. So now the new deal is, well let's invade the show. Let's find some excuse. And of course, it's certainly possible. Let's find some material to them. I'll do them. Grist for the meal. You see what I'm saying? Sure. I don't want to mention no names. Here's a Darren who says I'm a lawyer listening since the doctor done days. My lips are not blue, but I never call. I was thrilled to hear your response to the Fox News bitch. Thank you, Darren. Can you please replay the exchange tomorrow so we can be recorded. Also, my husband wants to hear it. We love you, your show and George. I'll still believe. I'll still believe. We'll think about it. We could play it tomorrow. Yep. It's on there. The same fact, maybe we'll just play it all day. I'll take the day off. Any consomna, this is an interesting fact. Okay? It says, hey, Neil, I strongly must disagree. Fox has probably the most reliable new station on cable. Better than CNN anyway, but President Bush is the rightful leader in Governor Bush. We were lucky on Tuesday. I love your priorities spelled P.A.R.I.T.I.E.S. I love your priorities. I see nothing wrong with making fun of those in public office. Love your show on Coleneal. P.S. Republicans are really the way they are on Tuesday. Any in Hums did. Well, there you go, Eddie. So there's a good Republican for you. But he's got a sense of humor. Don't bother him, none. Here's some more stuff about the name. Uncellicit it calls. Man, oh man, I open up a Pandora's box. Here's another one from Michelle. This is, by the way, after that bitch from Fox News, what the hell does she know about what goes on in this hell hole? That's right. We got enough problems already down here without you calling us, given us dictates from New York. Okay? All you impurities in New Yorkers up there to take your stuff. Don't stink. We already got one New Yorker down here. I think this stuff don't stink and believe me. Oh, you don't want to know. Let's see, do that to his wig. Good old Heather from Fox News. 5605, 604, 16 votes on a pool. Which of these words do you think is the most offensive? I think the word that I found offensive with Heather was like, hello. That was downhill right from there. None of the above. They're just words 256, 61.5%. Nigger 112. Oh, he didn't say the end word didn't he? Yeah. And the best part of it is just like the other people on that channel. Do you know the book, Nigger, the strange career of a troublesome word can indeed deal the background of what how this whole thing can. I know. I know. We didn't have a month. Of course you'd probably didn't. In fact, you know something if she'd look at I'm sure they had a month. I'll guarantee you. He was on every talking head news show because it was a highly controversial book. But she don't get it. She doesn't want to get it. K-22. Oh, sorry. Faggot 14. Speaks seven and Wop five. How about greaseball? There you go. Huh? I mean, there's so many words we could have put on there. But I mean, what's the point? It's time to get it on. Here's my email. Neil God. Yes, sir. That whole exchange reaffirms the Neil God. I can't believe I find it very hard to believe that a very young, obviously very impressionable white girl calls as a spokesperson for the dark side up in New York. How I write it. Oh, I will wait a minute, though. See, you're assuming something. I want you to keep one thing in mind. She never said that she represented the dark side. She wasn't upset so much about the racial aspect of it. At least from what I'm gathering. She was upset because I was picking on Condolisa. She wasn't calling from the color side. She was calling from the right wing side. That's why she kept trying to play this. Well, aren't you, don't you call yourself a liberal? She didn't give a crap about the racial part. That was just, you know, just she mentioned earlier in the conversation that she that there were groups that were disappointed in you having this on your own. Oh, I'm sure. You see, the American Nazi party don't like me picking on the Condolisa. It's funny, no, those groups actually called you yourself. You know, this, this, you know, go for at Fox News, you know, give you a call. Anyways, you know, keep it straight and the comments too. Okay, see you. See you. 560, 560, prom 560, on the AT&T and Verizon. Wireless line. Wonder how Dick Stockton's doing, you know? Nobody QAM. Neo, how are you? Okay. I gotta tell you, that's stupid bitch that called. I'm like the woman who wants to see things she is calling up and telling you what you can't cannot do. That's right. How do you think you are, honey, called up on this guy, damn high paid radio show. Give me your guy, damn let your boy want out of be doing. I don't know if you think of what I ought to be saying, whatever he's smelling sniffing. Sniffles. And Lucy, either she's unabugged or she hasn't got lead in months. Calling out to you now, lady. Stick it up your ass. Okay. Excellent. There's another good girl coming for you. So, well, send, maybe we ought to send her this black big black thing in here. Prosecutors, basketball star Jason Williams was drunk at the time of the shooting. Her story earlier. Somebody just facked it to me. Prosecutors are given the most complete picture yet of what they say happened. It dimensioned a former basketball star Jason Williams. The night the limousine driver was fatally shot. Williams 34 is accused of recklessly handling the gun that killed. Cost is Gus Christophe. And then try to make the shooting appear to be self implicated. He could face nearly 45 years in prison of convicted of manslaughter and other charges. Pretty well. Oh, no. You can make it about. Give me the ball. Give me the ball. Turn it about that. Okay. Just like the Brian Blades thing, he's too busy running fast and jump high. He don't have time to answer no questions. Here's a couple of red. Hello. Hey, Neil. I have another wrangle. Notice I didn't say take. I have another wrangle. These Republicans act in a subtle fashion. Everything's subtle. She wasn't too subtle. Well, it's interesting that they know that you're from a bride. And I think this was designed to fire up the blacks. Maybe a little bit. You know. Hey, you know. I hope it does fire up to blacks. And they realize that people like her and a fox news people all these right wingers. Want to like him. Friing down everybody's freedom of speech. The thing that's going to. And rage a lot of black people and Haitians, especially. Is this business about this policy last December that just mysteriously appeared. And the administration don't even want to tell anybody who invented it. Yeah. And one other thing, Neil. I switch over once a while to the Nazi station. This Chuck Bates. A new world order. It's to the right of Russell and ball Chuck who Chuck Bates never heard of him. Oh, you don't want to. He said that Paul Waston's now in hell because of this policy. Can you imagine that lovely unbelievable. Neil the mailbox. Okay. That could have been Rick the mailman. You know what was said? See me at the mailbox. I'm not sure which mailbox he was talking about. 560. 560. 560. It's time to get it off. I don't think so. I think your time is past for that sweetheart. Don't forget to join George Boker Brian and the girl ugly Chuck. 570 Treasure Islander. Why did he put that in your fat boy wrote that? I should point out to he. He came watering in here this morning and handed me that. Fill up calling me that. George Boker Brian and little Carlos. 570 Treasure Islander. It's a huge Halloween party with drinks. Specials on cosmic jelly. Yellow shots featuring Stephanie Evans. And boy, she's really going to do it for you. 570 Treasure Island. Just off the ball. I'm going to put it in the middle of the 120 second three. 10. Look at that. 62% not offended by any of those words. They're just words. 62% of the people with a brain. Here's a pepper pie. Hello. Yes sir. Are you doing this? Okay. I could tell you about what you want to call me. And why don't you still my name. I don't have damn pay. Exactly. You got it man. Well, you know, I like you bitch. I like you kiss and they get good morning. I'm going to go on my phone. So I love it. I'm going to do a work. Thanks, Pelle. All right. Thank you. Okay. There's our black collar for the day. She's got no sense of humor. You don't understand this show. That's another thing. You got the nerve. You're taking things out of context, which is why I didn't want to talk to them in the first place because I knew what they had up there sleeve. Try to take something out of context and twist it around and make it seem like a whole song in advance. Man, you people must be considering how they're always blowing their horn about. Oh, he's got twice as many viewers as Connie Chink and Phil's got a donny who's going to do it so great. How come they're so desperate? Huh? What do they need me for? I guarantee I'm not watching your crap. I guarantee that. I just channel surfing seriously. The number of times that I come across that that work. The only reason I watch an Amsterdam is because they don't MSNBC. And CNN is not. They have CNN international on over there. They only put US regular CNN once in a great while for a few minutes. And like the King Myster is on you know. He's on you know. He's on you know. He's on you know. So the only really choice you have in English other than sky news and BBC for me with which is mostly you know British news. If you want to find out what's going on here, you got to watch Fox News. So I got a real good idea what you folks are doing about all that orange pancake make up you're not full on this kid. All over this Halloween. Maybe that's why she called me Halloween. That's the orange network. Huh? Fitz right in. Maybe you want to hang up on her she turned into a pumpkin. If I could run, I'm going to have me some pumpkin pie. 26 after 11. I do like pumpkin pie. Don't you? No. You don't? I don't like it a lot. But like once in a while like I'm Thanksgiving something is an ability. I don't even like chocolate. Like I said Carlos won't be a treasure out of the night. He's going to be getting a tongue transplant. One that's got some taste buds. You don't like chocolate. I never heard of anybody in my life. I don't like chocolate. Same thing George said. I can't stand. Is that the one that I don't like it that much? I said I can't stand it. I don't even like the smell of it. Hey, I got news for you. What more had to do this morning was not chocolate. Okay. Oh, that's why the smell of it. Um, we're so offensive. You see what I'm saying? He's stupid. I know. He'll believe anything. 26 after 11 at 5. 60 WQM. Let's face it. You've been hearing us talk about fast train to leave. I've fast train coming out of both ears. Well, the facts are easy.

Hey Neil, in order to take a little pressure off about this kind of loser-right issue, can you play the comedy bit about the Holocaust? Dennis, that was Dennis. 560, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 80, and 10, right. And by the way, Dennis didn't get on the ear. You're never going to get on the ear again sweetheart. So does I heard the voice of the- that sounds like that, ranting and raving Dennis. I'm going to have to figure out what his voice sounds like. He's an accident waiting to happen. His who he is. I'm surprised he's not what his boyfriend today. It is Halloween. Here's homestead, hello. Hi Neil. Yes sir. I got some on a sort of cute story on it. I'm a Spanish or a spic- you know. Big him. And dime a dozen. And my sister when we got here at the Florida, she got married with an African-American. So, you know, I have nephews who are African-Americans in... Half an o. Yeah, so we joke around, you know, about spics and blacks and this and that. Yeah, they don't say blacks. Don't they use the word nigger? Well yeah, they use nigger. But we don't- they don't use the word spic. They use the word chicos. Uh-huh. So, to me, her- to them were all chicos and me, you know, with them, they're niggers. So we- but they're, you know, they're a- Don't you remember that- that's from Freddie Princho. Chico and the nigger remember that show? No, I don't think I remember that. Before airtime, yeah. Yeah. That's pretty hard. But yeah, you know, they're- and they don't- when they use the word, they don't use it offensively. They use it as a joke. All right. You see, this broad has no sense. And she kept saying me, you find that funny. Is there something funny? I thought it was like a female Joe Pesci. She kept saying that over and over again. She couldn't believe that anybody would find that funny. I think it's hysterical. Maybe she's related to Moe. Could be kissing cousin, baby. Yeah. Okay, I have a great time. Thank you. Spos and shows, what's wrong with that? Like, I suppose and shows is right to the point. And I just like that summer rating book, I'll suppose and shows. But there's nothing wrong with saying that. Just it's just an easy quick way to say who got the diaries. Dark folks and, you know, beeners. Oh, sorry. I shouldn't be talking with my mouth full because it's probably going to be throwing up. And we're going to do a big story about this. Good. Have a good time. Have a great time sweetheart. Here's the West Palm Beach, hello. West Palm is gone. West Palm Beach? Oh, it's North Miami Beach. I'm sorry. Well, some Beach, I don't know. You got me, no, no. Yes, sir. Sounds just like you. I think it is. Yeah, you see you with the comic strip, boondocks, I guess. Aren't you? One of the funniest with a two black kids. They're always being sarcastic about what's going on in the black community. Never heard that. The both doctors in the Harold might even be in the family. I don't know the kind of read the file. I only went to the godfather's Wednesday every day, funny paper. Yeah, what's the funniest hell? A few weeks ago, they had a strip and in it, they were sort of, it banned me about the words and it made sense when you read it. Hitler, Bush and the Holocaust. The sure enough, and it was funny, it's hell. Don't tell that to Vox Newsman, okay, not probably not going to be knocking on your door three in a morning. No, follow the letter from a lady. Look, God. A letter to the Harold, I survived the Holocaust, and that's disgusting. You shouldn't have it. You should ban your eyes on it. I think what you got to do is tell these people to look up the dictionary parody and satisfy and learn something. All right, you don't have to go buy a sense of humor somewhere. You do a great job. Thanks a lot. Thanks. See there you go. This audience seems, I mean, yeah, I'm sure we're here from some asshole. They're like Dennis who didn't get on here. Not because he disagreed because that was what's a, take some horrible shot. I know what he said was in such grotesque sport days. But what do you expect? We're glad it was boyfriend. Let's have them in the day before Halloween. Dennis, the ice Denise, I'm sorry. I thought there was only one Denise. I thought she was on him hockey games. 560, 0560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here is Palm Beach, hello. West Palm? That's you. I know. How are you? I talked to you a couple of times since I moved to Florida about 23 years ago. My husband and I both listened to you nowadays. I think I got all riled up this morning. Really? I think we're listening to that woman talk to you in the phone. You know, it's a non-issue as they say in political circles. If you get the people excited about a non-issue, then they're not paying attention to the real issues. That's the story, of course. Of course, it's 12 trip down here. He uses the White House as his campaign headquarter. Yeah, I think they're getting really desperate. Absolutely. But just man, hang in there because we need to go anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. The well stone was a voice of reason and he'll be surely missed. Yeah. And there's not many around that have the courage to express. I'm really disgusted with that just event, to a reaction to what went on there the other way. I mean, it wasn't a big deal and it started out very somber than a. As everybody said, who knew him, that would have been what Paul, well stone, would have wanted. Because he was a person of high ideals. He wanted very much to represent a certain viewpoint in a Senate and the whole pepperally that developed into, okay, so maybe that we're discurdious to Trent Lopp. What's he going to expect me in their in the middle of 99 percent Democrats? What is he expected? Absolutely. And it was the family's funeral. Right. He's hoping that the two sons were the ones who wanted it that way, so I'll can you disrespect their wishes on how they wanted to pay respects to their father? Kind of like having your own radio show. Yeah. Oh, what a concept. What a concept. Yeah. Oh, they're watching. Hey, Rob. Oh, we're fine. I'm like, I always say. Have a great day. Okay. See you. Thanks. You see the people are in a good mood. They like this. Show nobody forces them to listen to it. Nobody. I don't come on here and say, you've got to believe this. You've got to believe whatever. I'm just here to express my viewpoint. And I got news for you. Honey, I don't like con de lisa because she's a little bit too condescending for us. I'm concerned. Talk about a lightweight. I don't give her crap. How many colleges agree she's got? She couldn't find a goddamn Rhode Island with a compass and a road map. Okay. Condon, Lisa. Oh, she's this and she's that man. Okay. And it's gotta be the, it's gotta be the Bill or anything. I mean, you'd be, you'd be disparate and bear us too if you had a, oh. In a market. All that big build up. Oh, he's going to come in here. That's why they wanted me on the first place. They think Neil Rogers is going to put him on a map here. Well, this ain't got to worry about. He's making all the money off TV. He's got to be making more money than God. What the, what are you using me for? Nothing I care. I'm be sure and spell the name right. Okay.

The spending cash per lawsuit starts with smell and gets the custody working over time. I'm $4.5.50. You're a side-counter station for the new century. So why come to find out that not only is Heather full of crap, she's also a liar. Very devious. These dangerous games we play when we choose to fill a. She calls yesterday in the control room and she says, oh my God, I got to get a hold in the arad juice. So how to get a hold of. And I need his home number. And of course nobody's going to give out my home number here. And she says, oh yeah, but we want to do a story about his great ratings. Now he's dominated the market all these years. How do you like that, huh? For making up stories lie in bitch who you can and you're giving us a lecture on humanity? How do you like that? Does my come at for you sweetheart? Here's another one.

Only quite frankly I rather see a Mickey's butt than Bill or Rally. 560, so we're going to be playing that tomorrow between 9 and 10. Yep. It's on the that. Anybody didn't hear the a brilliant call from our good close friend Heather. It Fox news network in New York who's called here to give me a lecture about the song Kiss and A Good Morning and Cond Lisa. And starts to want to hold the thing where she went into a wrap about what a brilliant woman she is. And what do we put them up? I mean, that's like something out of a dream. Something out of a dream. Are you think that's funny? Yeah. WQAM. Yes sir. Speaking of lion perfect timing. After the election, the Gore Bush election. Falwell came on and said that there were 20 million. So cold right wingers. And then on 60 men it comes on a set there's 70 million. Are they multiplying like crazy? Yeah, what are they rabbits? The other thing is that the poll is now fighting 4644 and 10 on decided on the McBride Bush race. Where's your that? That was on the not the horse race poll, but the the garrison something poll garrison. Excellent. And the way everything is. If we didn't get about 200,000 Haitians to come on and vote next to you, they may almost stick your synget back to that place where they stuck in a silver spoon up his ass. By the way, I picked up the phony other day and I got a solicitation from the honorable Palm delay. Ah, with. Oh, not the number of my lunch. A live person came on it said I have the 30 second Tom delay recorded method. We please listen to this. And he starts out and all this right wing crap. As soon as you heard the name, it should have been the dial tone. And I kept saying, well, what does this mean? I don't understand this. What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? And they couldn't answer this. The go to our website, you'll find out. You should have told them where to go. Yeah. Thanks. Have a great day, pal. You know, somebody's people out there that would know Tom delay from seven second delay. But anyway, five six seven. Oh, five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. 477 votes on at pull 62% say they're not offended by any of those words. Sticks and stones and all other old crap, right? It's good good. Good. The model live by. How does that go? Fool me once and don't do it again. And that was the president said, yeah, fool me once and I won't do it again. Here is a member of park, hello. Well, I was wondering what kind of best of tape you would have. But he just is nothing. That would be plenty for me. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, let's just make a best of them with Heather from Fox. That call we get a 90 share with that call. It's every week. They're I love it. Make a regular feature of it. Let me tell you about what's the right wing in this country. What they would like to have on a year. Larna S. Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, G Gordon Litty, Oli North, Allen keys, all right wing all day. Anybody with a sending point of view get off the air. Who the hell are you to be saying those things? I mean, you talk about a fascistic mentality and they say that we throw words around like that. Well, you know, you throw them around because they happen as the food fits, bear it. Just the way it works. People don't want to like stamp down anybody else who has a different point of view. Tough crap, man. We're going to say it. Whether that pitch likes it or not, whether Bill or Ryle Lester not. Whether the Rupert Murdoch likes it or not. I don't get any check from Fox News every week. You think most getting any, oh, that's right. He didn't work for Fox. And was Westwood one. He got blown out of here's Miami. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I don't. I'm a half-spick half-crow. My wife's a whipback. My two friends, once a nigga, the other ones a wap and I worked for a big nose, too. And I've always worked for a few gentlemen. Got them. Yeah. And I think words are bunch of crap. These guys are crazy. These religious fanatics and these fucking politicians. Okay. Great. Woo! Have you been doing a little bit of motion? Larry the answer. He said something about the F and politicians. Well, that was a good lunch. No, sorry. He's a very subversively, we're quietly. Ah. Takes years of practice of enabling you with your mouthful. And talk with your mouth closed. Let's say for your telemarketing schmucks, anti-tellmarketing.com. Great show. P.S. how do I attack the buffet? And then John from porcelain Lucy, who's out of control facts is again. He says it's impossible to become a chronic factor. Three and one day, yes, John. And he goes on again about incoming calls. Oh, turn anonymous call rejection on permanently star 77. Turn it off permanently to turn it back on star 88. But I beat but I beat but I beat but I add and etc. Also, this is a publicity program for years. By many of the some priorities to be hilarious. My politics already voted absentee for Jeff Bush. But I still enjoy most of the songs we guardless of who they roast. Republican Democratic White or Black. As for Fox News, her call demonstrated classic liberal thinking and other oxymoron. It's okay for Harry Bellafond to call Conne de Liza and Cole and House Negroes because he's almost black. But if you do, you're automatically a politically incorrect racist pig who is defending every black person in the world. You handle it very effectively, but I guarantee you'll be subjected to a total hatchet of a Fox News. Next couple of days don't change anything. Big deal, John. And additionally, what you're wrong, it's got nothing to do with liberal. When you try to repress what other people say that ain't liberal. Ultra right wing. As in Rupert Murdoch, you can fool in anybody with a brain. Here's another fact, his, he knew one of the most youth phrases in the black community is, was up, Niga. They used this word on themselves more than we do. Was up, Niga? I hear that all the time. All they'd say to me. Better than. Faggot. Not actually not really. I like faggot a little bit better. Here's poking a creek, hello. Oh, no. Yes, sir. Oh, I was on your website the other day. And you said, you always say, you're fat. You got that you look like Larry King. You're not fat. Don't be fristed. Yeah, why do you want to date? No, not exactly. Okay. Do you want to know where I can get a copy of the best of cities or anything that you used to advertise last year? Now we're not doing that anymore. You don't do it in the best of cities anymore? No, not this year. Too many lazy people around here. Can we get copies of the old one? No. I'm just, I mean, I'm making it up. The answer is no, I'm not that I know of. No, I mean, I thought they'd be available on the website or something. No, they should be, but they're not. We have a whole bunch of them, but they're not because Eric's up. They're eating now. You know, I'll get on his ass about it. We'll get him on there. Please do. I enjoy your show. Okay, thanks. They should be on there. Why should we have it ongoing thing? I mean, girls tell me yesterday. We got all these leftover from last year. Why not cut the price in half? We give them money to charity to a band of pet rescue and go from there. If we got a whole bunch of stuff already. And then we can come up with those really nifty key chains like, It's time to get it off. Something like that. Oh, we're not. You know, just during the midst of all of this, you know, who's conspicuously absent and hasn't shown his face in the early one time since he came back after that family tragedy they had. Well, to come back, showing his face in the early one time. You know who that is? Great. Yeah, that's right. In the midst of all of this stuff going on, Tony, Mr. Oblivious. Mr. Oblivious. But have a nice day, Greg. Have a nice being here for a little while. 156 at 5.60 WQA. There's never been a better time to purchase a homo refinance. Resisting home. How about this rate? 3.95%.

This board is such a piece of crap. Here's Hank Goldberg, who allows another ounce or two or two or three? Not working at it. Ha ha ha ha. You want me both? Takes time. He's saying you take time, like 30 years. How come I don't see any level on there? Is this thing on? Give it a test. Smack it. Yeah, it's on. So, what do you think of my good friend Heather? Did you hear it? I was doing the ones that radio. Ah, geez, you missed it. Oh, I just heard you talking about it, but I intend to listen to it when you're showing it. You won't believe it. You won't believe it. And what I really believe is that, or while you saw this, but the book is here, which is such as it was. Nobody's here in the summertime. They don't listen to it in the summer, but after you held it even show in the in this book. They don't exist. So he had a zero. So all I tried to do is exploit and use me to try to whip up a number for them. So that's got to be that because nobody could be as stupid as she was. And you really think that's funny. And the kind of leaves is a very bright young woman above a bonus. Like she's giving me a lecture on what I should say and what I should think in that set of and so on. That's a mistake. Now bad move to Starway. Very bad mistake. Tragedy. So how's life? What is good? And the breeders cup? The breeders cup was great. I don't know. The day boys, I got no. For the breeders cup? Yeah, he doesn't usually, but I spent Thursday afternoon with him. I said, you ought to call him the old little tomorrow. I think I'll look that thing out. I got to my put the, this is the worst piece of crap bored by the way Bob for most. You should have seen Bob for most of the names today, by the way. You should have heard the crap he was talking about, Scraven and it was, in fact, Look what he gave me over there. This was, he said, Roy left us behind just to keep Scraven busy all the time. Oh, he was foment at the mouth about how you don't, you know, crap where you're eating, but I'm beat better. Well, I see gets a little booze in the man. That guy's a wild man. Really? Yeah. I have to take him drinking then. Better you than me. I don't want to ever see him again. He was a disaster. But no, I was with Dave Thursday afternoon. I said, you ought to call me. I need to study, buddy, mate. I'm Friday. Didn't do it. You know, it seems like every year in a breeders cup, every, oh, you had him. Every year, there's a horse that has to be destroyed. It seems there else has some horrendous injury. You know, I had that horse, Fox and he exacted with the two horses around one and two. He was 13 and one and the winner was 25 to one and a race. And he was making a great move on the outside. He stepped in that hole. Yeah. And his stable mate, the horse that finished second that, what the hell? I can't think of Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock, Rock. That ride that the British Jockey game was for認. They all of eight of no Brian's horses got stuck in a gate for some reason. Yeah. They didn't break well. Everyone of his horses, the train. No, but they kept talking about the fact that in England, they, they don't like racing really wide. And so as a result, he didn't want to be on the outside too long. But if he'd have pulled that horse in the back, he would have died. Really, you've seen a horse close that fence. Yeah. Well, the other thing is they run the other way. And then one too. And I'm wondering if maybe the horse didn't get a little. He wasn't here at the very long. A little spooked is that what you want to say? Don't say that. You'll be getting calls from Heather on your show. Don't be saying that. I worked for you. That's right. That's a bad conflict. Yeah. Final that the Dick Stockton works for Fox News. Do you know what I'm saying? Doesn't he live in Boca? Yeah. He works for... I mean, Clark Sports. And that's what I'm saying. Yeah. It's a different operation. But does he live in Boca? Yeah. I just mentioned I just did that. No, I didn't say he did. I know he did. But anyway. He doesn't look stocked and awful. I know you're a big guy. Your friend. He's a great guy. He must be a wonderful guy. He's awful on here. So boring. Home run. They're one of the great moments in the history of the world. So the home run is boring. But at any rate. Joe Buck was kind of disappointing. Yeah. You know, I mentioned this the other day. I know if you were listening. Saturday night. I'm at the track at Pompano. And I'm driving home in the series is on. And I've never ever liked John Miller because he does that. It's all he's, you know, I'll say if they have the fake one. He's doing a regular work game of the week. But he was so damn good because we hit it on the station. Yeah. He was sensational. You know, when he eases like they could have come back. Yeah. He was great. Not just good. I'm 10 times better in Joe Buck. Joe Buck to me is just on one step above generic. He was. I don't even think he's that. And when I want a bad break for Joe Angel. I'll have him leave here. Go to the Giants. I had Joe on the show last. Did you? Yeah. Good for him. Good for him. I'm glad for him. I always said anybody gets away from this place is always going to be moving up. It's especially when you're leaving John Henry in the Marlins. Well, look at the way using that beautiful ballpark out there. What could be, what could be bad about broadcasts in the Giants game? And then go to the world. Sorry to the 7th game every day. Yeah. And then everybody, you know, I kept hearing all these people while our ratings were so bad. And the lowest, who gives a crap. You know, it was a great series. Even though like I can't stand based on any more of that. It's terrific series. Yeah. Well, once upon a time, I mean, the world series was like the Super Bowl. Even if he didn't care during your regular season. Everybody wants to series. John Miller made a comment that so true about baseball. And, you know, one of the things people complain about is a lengthy game is a whatnot. But he got into the eighth inning and he said, well, they have four outs to do something. And he said, that's the beauty of baseball. Right. Four outs. If they don't don't don't do anything for outs, it's over for them. No time clocked, right? Anything like that. Time doesn't run out of it. I knew he said you run out of outs. And so true about the game. Yeah. I heard, I don't want to put it on you because yesterday was Robin Home and Mad Dog was just ragged on the Patriots again. By the way, I want to thank Joe. You should have seen a beautiful band. Did you see it? Carlos. That travel bag. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He had a beautiful, beautiful, nice thing. Didn't have any naked pictures of Tom Brady and everybody was okay. But he's ragged on him and this and that. First of all, I got no defense this year. They have no defense. Right. He's not reading any offensive lines given in an open attack. He's getting sack six, seven times a game. He's not playing that bad. But the fact of the matter is they got lucky. Finally said at the end yesterday when he finished ripping him, we got to ring by the Bing. Look at our ring. You know, they won a last year and he's talking how lucky they were in this and that, you know, one of the dolphins got to show us. And Bobbers made that in this town. Nobody wants to give anybody else credit. So they had your gap to be lucky to win to get that far. Well, that's a great coach last year. Right. And not this year though. No, I, you know what happened? They just got away from what they were doing. They tried to throw the ball every down. I think they'll be Buffalo. When they got to the fourth quarter of the Kansas City, you know, even though they won it over time and they blew that two touched on lead. Yeah. I could see that was like the unraveling of the defense. It couldn't stop my grandma. Other plane Brady a little differently. Yeah. He's a little bit like a pitcher. Yeah. Who goes around a little bit. Not okay. It was person life. I mean, I know you're no a lot of people. I say it was a catch. I don't know. I said, look at like a doctor. Don't stop what I might be at this stuff. He's the catcher. Is what we're here. But he goes around a lead one time. Maybe they're a little on to him. The second time around and they play him a little differently. Could happen. Don't be alright. WK, he looks so kiddo me. I think they win this week. Have a great show. Say hi to Bino for me by the way. We have had a great show. Yeah. Thanks to my good friend Heather. Maybe I can they have a call you with things good slow. See you later. There's Hanko 560. WK, we got the rating book here to take home. Oh man. It's pretty bad. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yours two man. 670560, Pond 560 on the AT&T line. Here's Del Rey. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes sir. She is her true DB. You know what that is? Heather. Yeah. Did you get a copy of the letter that was sent to Morgan David? Oh, you sent that? Yeah. Yes I did. Okay. Because he said he read the verse sentence and tore it up. Really? I read the whole thing. I thought it was great. Yeah. Isn't it something? Mm-hmm. He will not have missed anything. I can say about him. I've already said he's the most bizarre creature that's said. Yeah. I don't think he's a morning. Your sports station, right? Yeah. Supposed to get scores in the morning. Now they give the pan to score in the heat score. Yeah. Then they give you a call. Then they give you a phone number to call for the rest of the score. It's never heard such a thing. That's a little bit an automated station. This morning, opening of the NBA never gave another score. The talking canary only talked about the panters in the heat. Morgan, I forgot to put in their name. The program in the morning. Morgan David and the talking canary. Okay. It was a great letter. I'd like to say a little bit. It wasn't a waste. I read it all. Hi, appreciate it. Thank you. I've got it here. Maybe I'll read it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60. This is a very disturbing story. Football player kisses homecoming game goodbye. What a sad story. A single peck planted on his girlfriend's forehead cost a Henry County High School Senior that chanced to play in the homecoming football game. Now where is this? People send me these stories and I don't know what papers they're from or what Towner from a, oh, it says somewhere in Georgia. Because I see home news Metro. It's somewhere in Georgia figures. James Jamie Maurice is still smarty from his punishment for what officials at Union Grove High in McDonald. Consider inappropriate contact with Heather Kellock, 1217. The two day in school super, a suspension also blocked a starting varsity linebacker from the big game. His girlfriend of eight months was not disciplined for getting the hallway kiss spotted by a vice principal. It's been crazy. I don't want this tap into somebody else Maurice said. Yesterday it hurt me so bad my senior year missing my homecoming game. I'm going to be scarred for life. I have no stories to tell my kids. An upset Deborah Hefflan sought out the news media to bring attention. What happened to her son? Homeshe describes his very affectionate good student has never been in trouble. I just think they're carrying us a little bit too far Hefflan said. Let the punishment fit the crime. School officials believe it does. The district considers inappropriate contact being between students a no no. A no no. And leaves it up to principle to decide exactly what is appropriate. Rodney Boller. Union grow principal said kissing hugging excessively in other physical contact. Distract students from academics. We want a strong academic environment in which kissing is not an activity to take place in the school building. You said Maurice said he had no idea a kiss on a forehead would violate. A little peck on a cheek a kiss on a forehead. Man. You talk about a bunch of y'all. Oh this is from the Atlanta Journal Constitution. Thank you. Maurice said he had no idea that would violate school rules. They should be cracking down on guns, drugs, fighting everything else at the 17 year old. Who collected 800 student signatures in the failed attempt to get the Henry County School Superintendent Jack Parish to reverse Bowler's decision. Bullwerse that he's enforceable consistently and plans to continue doing so. At least it doesn't students have served in school suspensions this semester for the same violation of the little peck on a forehead. County School board members have not considered reviewing the policy advice president Murray and Mitchem who to climb to comment further. He's been Robert is still dead. I didn't like that, huh? Little peck on a forehead you're out in Georgia. Very sad. What did I tell you about this redneck country vars? Oh and by the way! Oh! You remember a couple of days ago somebody facts me that thing about redneck nation right Michael Lifergoth. And I was almost out in the book he was on. I think was on Crossfire last night or one of those talking he had chosen so many of them. This guy's a raving right wing lunatic. He's a right wing extremist. He's not an all-what-they are representing to be that. So thank goodness I saved some cash my lucky day. 560 pound 560 on the AT&T. And for wise and wireless line. 10 past 11 at 560 QA.

But the message being, hey, you see these liberals, even at the right down there in Miami, these liberals, they're against you. Blacks that make it fun, you see all vote Republican. Is that gonna happen? No, chance who you kiddin' man? Especially once we find out about this racist immigration policy that the Bush administration started based on, we don't know what cause they ain't saying. You got a question? Hmm, our lips are sealed, no matter what it is. Now, if you believe in government of secrecy, especially when it comes to what should be open policy. Hey, just go step right on down, man. Five hundred three votes, which of these words do you think is most offensive? None of the above. They're just words three hundred fourteen sixty two and a half percent. Oh, nigger, hundred and thirty three. See, again, that's a social thing one more time because a lot of you folks are just behind the times. You know what I'm saying, nigger?

Wow, the Italians, hey, the Italians don't make fun of them, you don't understand? They give you that, they put their finger, their index finger on their nose. They turn it off to the side if you make fun of them. What that's like a Sicilian message. It's like the fish in the vest. It's a different Sicilian message. It's the old Bopongurl, the Italians salute, which means somebody's going to come visit you with two in a morning. And it looked just like Luca Brazzi. Here's the fact it says the motto for Fox News should be, we disturb we derived. Have these morons no shame? Well, the answer is no, obviously not. You've had these pirates on for months now, but they're only bringing up five days before a very close selection. Knowing that you've spoken favorably about McBride, it says. Hmm, or I guess we could put another way besides, which is hard to say. Yeah, this is also hard to say. Not only yorkers are like that fascist Heather, adolescent new everyday, part in the expression religiously. PSC to please play Willie T. Ribs for the Murdoch who's there. Just there you go. You ask me shall receive. Here's the facts from Furn who says. Now see, I love Hank. We see what happened to the calls as soon as I understand, but it's out of, uh, Sink, you know, they don't want to wait for the Humper. A lot of open lines now for some strange reason. 567560 pound 560. Well, probably because they couldn't hear him. That's probably the biggest reason. Probably. You talk about a microphone that don't work. I like to take a ball-peen hammer to that thing, okay? Got the pot wide open here and nobody's even smoking it. Furn says, Neil, that call from Heather from Fox was hysterical. I burst out laughing. You were just great the old Neil I remember. Yeah, pretty good. That used to be about 50, 60 years ago, right, Furn. I was drinking my coffee when you took the car to answer it was just what I wanted to hear about that bitch, Condolisa, and the rest of that bunch of low lives in that administration. Thanks for you. I wish more people would listen to you. So do I. Can't stand George when he's on. I turn him off. Good luck, Furn. Thanks, Furn. I like when George is on because it means I'm not here. I'm not working that day, but nevertheless, I turn him off too. Too much ass talk. 560 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon line. But you can tell George's in person at Treasure Island tonight put on your Halloween best. Go to the big Halloween party with drink specials on Cosmic Jelly, Jello shots, featuring Stephanie Evans is going to be Priced around squirt and stuff all over the room.

Yeah, this is our Larry from Cape Coral. Yes, Larry, okay. Hey, I was wondering was your birthday yesterday today? It's not easy to want us next Tuesday. Okay. I'm going to see you happy birthday, Tom. Well, thanks a lot. Never too soon. It's say happy birthday. Okay. Well, happy birthday to you. Thank you so much.
