Never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio Howard David, voice of the Miami Dolls I'd say you want it and you don't need the game was for what I will I listen to you guys every day you guys are doing a hell of a job It's fun to listen to and all Brian I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there's great What did I hear that right? Back up for two I listen to you guys every day you guys are doing a hell of a job It's fun to listen to and all Brian I mean the whole thing you guys are doing there's great Wow even Mohour David listens to Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio Exactly. I'm getting pound you should have supported your own station I don't understand well hold it hold it what is one thing I don't understand Well one thing has to do with another a lot of network show that happens to be carried on another station in the market place Also so hands you go on everybody's show opposite years at the same time You think hands you go on their station when you're on the air if thank Goldberg appears on another radio program that happens to be carried on the market place It's a network show and it happens to be on opposite me. I don't give a damn about that right. Why would I care about why does that matter? I'm going competition in numbers Howard you know the business you know how works I just don't think you want to support Neil Rogers Well now you bring you up something that's completely different. No. I think that's why I think that's the biggest problem You got you don't like Neil Rogers and you did you wanted to go opposite to him and you really didn't care who you offended Well, what what what what what what what what what what I tell you what since the man is standing in the controller right now Why doesn't Neil Rogers tell you Tell me since the day I walked in to this place He's done everything he can undamined this program since when I'm getting down to bat brass tax I'll look right in the eye and tell him right now to his face I think you brought something on yourself you blamed all right, but you even bother arguing Whether around appearing on a network show what the hell is that have to do with anything? And if the object is To get me pissed off didn't trust me when I tell you didn't think 53 a QM dammit Anyway, it's a 903 is what it is now almost whatever it is. I'm in slater That was pretty exciting. I just happen to be standing because they have the door open this morning, which is very exciting So I could go in there and bond with the Zack and Robert my good close personal friends Robert's clothing about the election I'm telling you Robert if we discover these anal love beads yesterday instead of Georgia stupid rosary beads Democrats would have kicked ass But anyway here this call happens to be unjust at the same moment. There's my psychic powers. I'm kicking again And I'm listening to cause about to turn around and walk out because Mo gets very upset when he sees me gets physically ill And I was about to turn around and walk on I hear this call going on about me and about the fact that Mo was I'm Concording with the enemy on Monday see this business about it being a network show I mean as what would the hell Zach got to do with the addition of which he wasn't a guest on the show He called in He called it on it show He was on the phone. It's unlike it was a guest in a studio and invited guest He called and it was on the or what Tony Bruno I'm Schlock sports And I think the caller had a good point of that is you don't conserve with the enemy, but you know That's the way it goes. I really didn't make that big of an issue out of it We got the promo on her which we got through hook or crook Which we find most amusing especially the part where she says even how our David listens to it Set her in so on see now you're getting your your mean bastard You really are it's all you not me Mo. It's all George you were right in the first place And then that line he's got in there about since the day he got here I was trying to undermine that show see how soon they forget now you can go on here and lie through your teeth all your sports Sick of fans out there. Mobile but the truth of the matter is I was the only one would give you any support The only one because of those quotes in very jackasses column remember the origins of that back in the spring back in the late winter when ever it How it was He was gonna show him what sports talk was really all about and sports talk is boring And so some of the other people on this station which I don't want to mention a name I took exception to that and I can see that I can see their point and so They got off on a wrong foot, but as far as I was concerned I kind of like enjoyed that because you know me I'm a Schmidt to Sturber and I'm not part of the sports doc fraternity anyway So I gave him all the opportunity in the world and then of course You're running around making comments about his bad hairpiece and about the checkered pants and I may have Enbellished him just a little little bit But and then of course right away he had and then we had to think with Greg and him in here that day I thought we kissed and made up remember that stood right there for that microphone I played one day of Boca Brian Moa Mo Howard bits laughed at that the fact of the matter is he just He's got no sense of humor when it comes to himself And so we're continues to escalate and escalate and of course the audience loves it look at the he's looking at response We had the police today look at the response and you want in a while like I said the other day about Joseph Gackie and I Joe's get so gets it he's like a real person I mean I've been saying on year for years that he's boring his most boring person on year I can take up and he is But that doesn't make him a bad guy that doesn't mean we hate each other He understands that he gets it understands it's a radio show and if somebody wants to say this show sucks I'm a moron we got a bunch of trained monkeys that doesn't bother me because it's a radio show. I got to change my life He lemon 131 votes on yesterday's pool our question was what should the punishment be for Mo Howard David sucking up to the enemy Fox sports Monday Who's hope Mo Howard David 391 14 and let me also say this? What what other publicity does he get from this radio station other people or any billboards any TV spot Any real newspaper add nothing any guy walking up and down the your causeway with a sandwich board nothing any Skywriting and Jim had over nothing absolutely nothing So I brought that show to the attention and don't give me the song that is but well Yeah, you're ripping that's not the point that's not the way works especially in this market That's not the way it works There've been more people tune into that show because of my talking about it than all the publicity in the world could have done no contest And if you just expect me to sit here and go out about way else He it's gonna be a wonderful show and you better tune in they're not gonna do that I can't tell people what to listen to there reminds me to Tim Wigim days on Zeta. Oh if you just talk better about our music Talk better maybe if you're played better music maybe people listen to it like I'm gonna talk it's like going into a restaurant Maybe I could be the greed or at a restaurant Like Larry Glick I could be the greed or at some restaurant where the food is really crappy and I could stand in the doorway Say oh it really is crappy, but you know I'm telling the I'm still here to tell you it's really good and they're gonna come pouring in there because I'm standing in doorway Tell me that it's it's dog crap, but it really is filet mignon it looks like dog crap And it smells like it and probably it's but it's really filet mignon. It's really shut to putting on It couldn't happen 1136 votes who's more Howard David at 394 Fire is old asked to 98 still his two pays one 72 He gets raped in it by the whole staff 109 Venish him from paradise 63 no penalty he gets a gold star at a purple jelly bean 55 4.8% He gets raped into my freaky Carlos only 45 that's not really because So what I thought about you want to know why he only gets 45 with freaky Carl Because nobody has any idea who the real estate yeah, nobody knows who that is when he except for the handful of Former power 96 morning show listeners when freaky Carlos was on there.

Oh take me to your leader not But seriously, I the the scene that we just had in there I have no idea what they have that door open all the now I realize it's probably a better idea to have it closed And every time I would look in there he would see me just like like like he just saw the ghost of Christmas past or something It's a radio show Howard that's all it is it's a freaking radio show And you can have a hard on the rest of your life about the around you's and about George Rodriguez and about the beast and about anybody who Consorts with us It's just a radio show.

It's just astonishing I people ask me say they come up to me I said have you really ever encountered anything like this before and I say no Never even dreamed there could be something like this and when that guy called that we just played that call You could see the the blood rolling around right underneath the hairpiece I mean it was just boy I thought it was gonna boil right over and maybe the bag also at the same time It was bubbling you know how like a radiator when no overheats starts bubbling well that's what was going on in there I'm not sure exactly where it was coming from It's a radio show mo all Howard I don't think I'm gonna have much success. I've tried everything I know I've extended the hand-off friendship. I've offered all you know all kind of accommodation Remember this is a thing about where you were being held the hostage right and if I would back off on mode and you wouldn't get canned Well, you know that's too many months ago.

All right And I did and I backed off and then I came back here for a few days now we had our little Birthday party in there and by the way nobody Came in here from that show and wish me happy birthday at least nobody from that side of the window Including guilty But back on June 3rd when we had that birthday bash in there at least I was invited to come in and kiss his highness is ringing Wish him happy birthday at that point that was an ugly day turned out that it was just fun We said I sat down in there was invited I didn't want to be on there Sat down he invited me to sit down and the be on that show I thought we had fun for five and ten minutes. I thought it fun from here. Everybody else I talked to said it was a bunch of yaks It was okay and he took exception to that He just didn't get it. I don't think there's anybody this building who has either the ability or maybe even the desire to explain it to him It doesn't get it so we have this massive war go and on but it's a war on one side See that's the thing I don't understand there's no war from this side we're just having some fun And people might say wow gee, but those bits you're planning you're ripping Comedy bits we don't we have bits about yeah, who don't we have bits including me and about Druid about everybody about Voka Brian everybody else in a goddamn radio station Josh Friedman You think that fact-tubba crap is gonna come in here and say oh gee you really hurt my feelings He wanted a copy of it.

It's a whole lot of stuff like this hey It's the compactest that's lower than the bottom of Lake Superior And there's a bustle in your CD player don't be alarm now. It's just Gordon Lightfoot sinks lead Zeppelin I'm 17th boy that's your answer brought you know at five sixty wq a.m. happy Wednesday to it And you're also something we got a pool today on the election. What's your take on Tuesday's election results? You know I voted I don't give a Schmidt did I say it was gonna be Republican sweep my psychic powers right into again I could feel it. I just knew it And I got it called as yesterday about his problems with the appalling place in Howard was also on channel for news last night And I you know obviously there were a few people didn't have those problems, but you know the margin was so off side And one way or the other plus the media did a great job of convincing everybody and Broward that they'd have a two or three hour wait that nobody showed up That was a good way to make sure that nobody and I'm not blaming any bug partisan I'm just saying the media really screwed up big time. Oh, it's gonna be two and three hour weights and they have two few machines And they's got two thousand more machines and it turns out that thirty five percent the people are less and borrowed showed up thirty four percent I think so we're no lines and we're no votes But I made no difference because it was a landslide Because this country is turning more and more to the right to got to call yesterday You said there's more of us than there are a few year right you are right 2000 that wasn't the case in the presidential election now it absolutely is Don't ever overestimate the intelligence of the American electorate out there and of course Don't ever overestimate the intelligence of the Democratic Party because like I told you yesterday Man they had they had nothing they sent back in a coward in the corner well We better not talk about this. We better not attack the president. Well, that's what you got you got nothing You got squat you got cream baby. You got slaughtered Even hitt water monday Creamed so the Republicans have the Senate they got the house. They got the White House. They got the Supreme Court They got all these other judge ships that the lobby able to confirm they got oh they got it They got the country by the balls So that's our poll question. What's your take on yesterday's election results? I don't give a Schmidt. I'm suicidal I'm ecstatic I'm ready to leave the country or they're all a bunch of crooks those are your choices on a poll Here's the facts from Rick who says happy birthday of yesterday's election in the debacle The only polls are going to next time will be the quarter poll or the eight-pull of calder There you go good choice Rick Don't blame you Why don't you waste the time You know I'm a set what and I haven't seen him in a morning for a coupons age But I was channel surfing this morning and there he was with that you know the dead man in the chair and I give him credit He was talking about the election in the about how CBS and Dan weather are so liberal and biased Which he's right about that and about how CNN just so obnoxious all the way around and how they're smug and whatever they say is the truth and then he also said Which my ears really perked up just like like this my antenna he said you know as far as Fox knew is that he said they're even worse He said they all ought to be wearing sheets over there How do you like that Heather? He said all you people at Fox ought to be wearing sheets? And that's the newly conservative Don I'm a sin last year's after his rehab After you had to give up the bottle all of a sudden came back as a conservative But nevertheless and spite of being a conservative nevertheless He still says the people at Fox News ought to be wearing sheets. How do you like that? The correct always liked that I'm as you know even when he was alive So that's the way the election came out. I'm sure gonna get a lot of calls today and you can call up And then and do your usual childish thing we like like Robert Robert now. He was pretty civilized about it He was too busy trying to referee you know between what else was going on in there Try to stay on the chair while he and Zach were laughing their answer See everybody I am I the only one who's who picks up on that that it seems like maybe they're just doing it for my benefit when I'm around But it seems to me like all of the other people I encounter in this building Understand this stick they have a sense of humor. Am I wrong about it? That's just in the building Everywhere we've ever been no I'm I'm forget about outside the building. I'm just talking about the current situation. Oh, yeah the current Moe situation Moe goes on the Moe he becomes iconic Yes, and and also let me say this to you. It's one thing even even assuming there is premise about calling another Network out of town radio show is no big deal See it's one thing to call in to make a comment about the ball game or about whatever it is your the topic might be It's another thing to suck up and say oh, yeah, I listen you guys every day. See they're the competitor Even for him. They're the competitor, but that makes no difference because that's not important What is important is to drive they stake through the heart to give the old twist and give the stuff that's what's important So one last time I extend the hand-of-franchis For this meeting that there has been proposed that I propose. I suggest to that Because I think that's the only way to clear the error. We're gonna have like World War 4 here Of course I'm not gonna be here much to the time anyway. I'm busy going to that Martha Stewart class I still don't get that do you? No, not even the second time now 560 560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line the pull is up on yesterday's election Is that thing working or not because my vote is on it?

Maybe they're at the passport office Yeah, I don't think it's up there yet. Well, I work a lot of snow WQAN I'd like to finish the meal. I beg your pardon. Happy birthday, so thanks. Oh, yeah, I hear that that little phone call there Yeah, leave my lips in three months that guys gone You're gonna run them out of the door here. I'm not running and I see that's not the thing to say cuz I'm not I don't let anybody out but that's his personality. It's not you as him. Yeah, you can take that kind of crap That's his problem. You can hear it in his voice. Yeah, yeah, yeah He was like up on his call. He was I was kind of scary. I was worried for him I don't I don't like the guy but anyway, that's just try to point happy birthday It's great to hear you that's flat Amsterdam. Let's blow fat one over there. Okay Hello Josh treatment never was my type 567 0560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon. Why and we said blow a fat one That pull gonna be up or not did Eric uh, do we have any idea? Maybe maybe they just have no interest in that thing No, I don't know It's obviously not working WQAN Yes, those kind of find out. It's not show on still tonight at two in the morning to fix Is it still out? Yeah, okay. I was just curious And what else do you think about that this whole rep for end was for George W? He took it to the Democrats he went in campaign and kicked their butts. Don't you agree? Yes? Thank you ever great today. Okay. Yeah, he did He did he spent he raised a record amount of money he went out there and you know And whether you like him or no, which I don't but he got the job done That's what it's all about not about the best interest of the public and survive partisan politics and spite of all this crap about wow That's your baloney. That's what it's all about Because they all represent special interest Democrats have got labor and her special interest and the Republicans have got the oil people and whatever And that's what it's all about in the public well or screw no matter what. What's some of you might think we're screwed all the time pulls work and like I told you See you're getting more like him all the time like who? What's your take on Tuesday's election needs? Results needs I'm ready to lead the country six. They're all amongst your quirks three I'm suicidal too. I'm ecstatic one and I said I don't give a shmit that my vote. I don't Then surprise me South Dakota by the way is very close. It's with like a hundred and some votes the a Senate race in South Dakota Time dashals out trying to find some dead people not too easy to make up votes in South Dakota Because when there's only like 80 people live in a whole state in the first place it's kind of like is conspicuous You know when he's covering in some ringers Unlike in this day where we got like millions and millions and some of matcha there like citizens, you know Some of actually alive and are still voting like you know it's time to get it on WQAM On a national level the Democrats moved because of the partisan politics I don't want to get anything through they don't want to put the budget through so I think to kind of hold themselves a little bit on that Yeah, but that's the way it is I guess that's the way it is and we have I love you good bush. I love you Yeah, but Is the guy loves boots boots boots? You got all the boots you can handle man in your case. It also not like too much 560 5050 5060 I see and I'm rubbing these beads that's bad. Why did I take these out of that package? I just aim a lot of beads I'm gonna just go and out of the hall Oh my god It's good thing I didn't like pull the string on these when I was dead and there I think that would have been the end I think that that piece would have flipped right off his head Come on mode just lighten up a little bit. It's quit being such a hard ass God Up until this moment I never quite realize just the degree the extent of psychosis and paranoia up till this moment to actually witness it yourself WQAM WQAM Hello Nobody on seven I think it's the quiet guy. Oh the quiet guy and Rick Satches We're also I'm as was rippin for the fact he was in the newsroom with his sleeves all rolled up until somebody told him MSNBC made him do that But he said boy look like a jerk And I was thinking of myself well even with the sleeves rolled back down he still would look like a jerk being in there I mean who the hell's Rick Satches what credibility's he got to be covered in an election? You know Rick snatches But the effects is in it that I don't mean fixed in terms of fixing the actual outcome But the it's the deal of sealed And I will see what happens now we'll see what kind of right wing paranoia and crap passes for our government this country And I'll say it again. We got nobody to blame at the Democrats don't blame their Republicans they just went out there into the best to think they could Greece as many palms as they could the Republicans didn't Greece as many ways enough money and they campaigned like crap that that's what it was down to All my democratic friends out there all tenia Gonna be to blame but yourselves because they they stunk they stunked it you and And that guy the fact me yesterday remember at the beginning of the show old Bill McBrides two points ahead Right right always the matter for I think he won didn't he?

Thanks a lot Mitch and by the way Long history dollars WQAM Okay WQAM Yes, sir. Hey, pick you might be able to play that call from the First team where they got asked about the search and then his two pay From the first from the first team Well, whatever the morning show whatever the same where the guy was talking to Moe asking me to The guy that did a two pay with same surgeon that did pump it out. Yeah Would they keep you might be able to play that mean the doctor thing about J. Feedler's a surgeon? Yeah, yeah, yeah, you mean the one that goes the doctor that performed the surgery on J. Feedler's thumb Isn't he the same doctor that performed the procedure on your two pay? Okay The doctor who performed the surgery What's think about that? What's his name? Klein Felix doctor? No I don't know who he used to use George Colwell. I'm not sure I'm not sure where he went. I'm not sure where he went. Did you go to Holy Cross? I don't need it Not sure well bottom line is it I don't the doctors can't tell how long days it will be No, you're not sure somewhere at least a month could be up to eight weeks somewhere in there walking in the wall with your QM. Hi, Moe. I'm sorry. Not walling You know you can't be so vain. We're talking about curly Simon that's how you can't be so vain when you're old And you weren't a bad hero piece. I mean look, let's face it none of us are like fashion plates in this place We don't have other than Miguel and the name of your female in this building. It's really great looking Carole Carolyn You better watch yourself mister. I watch myself, but yeah, you better take a look at a mirror before you leave a house in a morning, but anyway But other than that we don't have like a lot of really beautiful people in this building people You just say oh look at that there's like a real beautiful hot person There's a real like fashion plate most of the people come here dressed like slums like we are today because why it's a radio Not her television I'm telling you I'm making some kind of a appearance. We're not going out in sales like fat boy and have it put on a good appearance Or like PD Lenny the this shoveled PD Lenny you look like he just crawled from out of a dumpster I'll tell you one thing about PD man. He sure is he is he makes me look like a snappy dresser And that's almost impossible Seriously, he is just I think he's going for comedy. You think he sleeps in that crap or what he must So how can you possibly be vain when you get advanced in years when he gets being old fart How can you be vain about your age and about all these things just lighten up a little bit just a radio show It's a means to an end. We're not going to change the world here talking about some stupid ball game and about Ray Lucas the this and George Lucas said that and Jerry Lucas the this who cares, you know We're just trying to fumble our way through lives into the best we can that's my motto do the best you can under very trying circumstances But we just have a situation here and I don't know if you can change when you get to be at that advanced age You think it's possible for people to change and say no when you know something maybe you got a point Another I understand where you really coming from because some people though. I don't understand where I'm coming from that's what bugs me like Heather she was a good example She started with an agenda and the agenda was a positive point that I may virulent racist in that liberals are all really racist And we're not going to help out the black folks and you black folks stay home which uh and Broward least lot them did and everybody else too Nice job you folks in the media by the way warning everybody there'd be a two or three hour wait to vote yesterday I'll say again. What's gonna make any difference? It's not an excuse, but it's just an excuse to be doing that Cuz you scared a lot of people away But at least we can say look at this we're unblumished today Florida didn't have any more embarrassment except to we elected governor and attorney general WQAM You know First of all, I want to take a good regulation to you. I'm what for have me tell them to the financial situation to get out of this country Yeah, you're a very lucky person. Yes, I Second Well, I'm growing up now the years I used to hear this slow then you never talk politics in your religion Yeah, and a bar and now I've become the real eye that each who caught have so much similarities Unbelievable it's like people are just following people and You know, not even taking consideration because you're Republican you've got a low Republican Okay, even though he might have been a right person for the job They all exactly vote for what their party is and not the right person and I'll put you really show South ignorant and stupidest country get and you should vote for the person that you think will do the best for your state Well guess what guess what?

You're just visiting But that's seriously. I'm not depressed. I expected it. I'm one of the very few people who predicted it was gonna be a Republican sweep I predicted that right here on a show You could feel it you could smell it because smell the stench of defeat coming from the Impitted Democratic Party who always when push comes to shove they always seem to be right there to let us down And they do they never disappoint they always let you down And it's not gonna make a big difference anyway because the country's goose stepping right behind this president right on a road Again, and we're gonna have a hell of a good time 234 votes on here.

I blame Robert Giepper for that. Well, we're trying to get even for that election You know Robert's okay. Although he better watch himself him and Zach were like rolling on a floor during that call this morning there There were out of control Of course luckily the focus of the other part in there was all directed toward me so he didn't see them rolling around in the cheer WCOM God WCOM Neil yes, sir I'm driving in my car running 53 this morning and that dog liquor how would they? What's that stuff with that guy in the control room that he's he used me? I mean you got chunks of that guy in your spill man. Why is this just play? 24 hours a day seven days a week for the next month Good more skits and then I'll listen for the rest of my life. Okay, that's a new format all more all day Demo we hear it. Demo we like it Mofui you money Demo we plan the mode they listen here's the facts from Gary who says good morning Sorry a birthday to fall on a counterout conversion away to theocracy see I had a fine birthday I have no problem with you know I wasn't really excited about the turnout, but that's what I expected Could you explain how the morons in this they could vote for a member that reduces plant sizes and for a tupstour God devious plans to undo it. Well, they don't care see see that's the deal the people go out there And they say well, I'll pretend I really care about education which they don't if the people in this state ever cared about education We would be like suckin win and write down their word Mississippi is the last and next to last in every category They never cared about it. They don't care about it now, but it just sounds good. It's definitely politically correct to say oh our number one issue is education right Give me a break So they vote for it and then of course they know it's not gonna happen because he's gonna make damn sure it doesn't happen And the kids will be still be going to school in port of bodies and you know all these other places But no air conditioning in the summertime. It'll be great just like it always has been Which is another reason I know but he under the age of a hundred ought to be living here because people are over the age of a hundred Don't have little kids go into school. Let me could just close down all the schools Close down the schools and build more shoes bring some more old Jews down Right right on 567 I'm just you know I'm not gonna get all whipped up to a frenzy about it I'm gonna I've got good article here by Thomas Friedman the American Idol about Bill Clinton and the Germans in the way they admire him And the reasons why I'll save it. I think for tomorrow glory. Dances oil thirst behind bush policies But I'll save that for tomorrow also Because today I just want to sit here and yank on my Loved beads yank on my beads Those are the biggest beads I ever saw yeah the way well we got a lot of people around here with a big Bracom okay, so maybe that's the reason WQ I am Yes, sir Neil yes Hello about you in George. Oh, he's a pleasurable listen to you guys For example comments on our fantastic election I think you were right. I don't think the Democrats had much to say they didn't seem to do any acting They just reacted to Republican stuff they voted against them the president They got out of step with the mainstream who is behind our what's best president So I guess if you're gonna go out and slam the president mode against everything the president does when the president's the most popular president We've had it all one time You're gonna get thrown out of office You have to present an alternative they could say the economy was an disaster and they were headed in the alternate events Great Just to say the economy is an a mess and more in another recession and then not have any I'll turn it forward you're gonna do about it. That doesn't convince too many people Exactly, they simply said no we don't like the president's doing so we're gonna vote again And you know and you know why they didn't do it because they were scared if you're running scared you're gonna lose You know actually these are the same people who Now go for president a couple years ago now I don't like Bush I really find them dis-faceful that religious crap and all those other people And yes, well, you know, you know, I'm coming from big news But I'm not real Reported with how out gore who ran for president could have been stupid enough To have come in at a time when the economy was good and up You know everything was cool and how did he manage to lose when you got to be pretty stupid to have lost George That's right It's called snatching the feet from the jaws of victory. That's right Yeah, okay and and what happened this time with and you'll notice here is one of the most popular presidents in history That he didn't want to campaign with him and like Arkansas and the Clinton's home state and wanted to blues Not just about they hold deep South as a result of it So the guy still a little seamen on a blue dress Yeah, he still was a great Brilliant president good guy and well liked it well respected yes, now so now we have 911 come along and Bush Whether we like him or don't like him He'll at least as well as gore would handle things no and so he comes across as a strong Protect America kind of a die no, he doesn't we look look let me say this See, no you're making it much too complicated if issues like that would have been important like here in Florida We just had the bolt loads of Haitians It showed very clearly that this whole thing about homeland security is just like the dog and pony show They're doing it the airports we're not safe Well, there's no homeland security. It's just it's just a dog and pony show for the public So to suggest that is because he doing such a great job in a war on terrorism where we have a cut or Sama we haven't caught this one. I mean that that's not the issues had nothing to do with it Issues had nothing to do with it the fact is the Democrats came across as weakneed and impotent and they lost The deal with the bride but bride comes up and makes them an house and I've got this plan for better education for the kids And we're gonna blah blah blah blah and then somebody says where's this money gonna come from? Yeah, and he goes Yeah, he comes up with an answer that a third grade math student can figure out swall Then the same electorate who votes against McBride who wants more education votes for constitutional amendment That's gonna raise our tax right through the roof right and you know what and you'll agree with me on this I know you maybe you're brilliant Yeah, they'll argue in closing yes in closing Lowsy parenting closes. Lowsy grave good kids from good families whose parents care get good grades in our crappy school And the kids who come from cockroach families don't do too well on school in the parents I say let's put them all on a goddamn pub 10 forget the air conditioning for good about anything else And the textbooks and have a great day boy Pup pup pup pup pup pup he was worked up like Denise pot fan Only a little morey articulate It's 11 out to 10 at 5 60 WQM half that bald spot is getting to be a real sore point with you know because a lot of you guys are vain And a lot of you guys also aren't getting laid at all and other and a lot of guys out there just start getting ahead and life They're getting ahead well the answer is have some hair Believe me we got people around here are just obsessed with here If you are get some hair from Charles Alphiiri because at least if you're gonna put something on your head Make sure it looks natural and looks good and that's the key the natural hairline system looks like it's the real thing like it's grown right out of your scalp Not like some growth test Animal from outer space oh my do I have about that small of the last night from outer space dot in your head When that we need must have been a small spaceship you know because John just picked that thing up and put it right on the back of the pickup Right, well it was that lightweight metal, you know from Krypton I see kind of like my glasses maybe it was titanium Or maybe it was part of the titans Kryptonian anyway here's the the Occult Charlie Alphiiri what they'll do is they'll bring you in there They'll set up a consultation no obligation and they'll situize down and show you just how about how this is the most and how much better And younger you guys can look and how they can make your ball spot disappear forever Nothing lose but that ugly grotesque shiny spot on your head call toll free 1-800-321-2413 Manchany or Roger save an extra 200 bucks off the regular price 1-800-321-2413 and get some hair back today or check them out on the web at Charles Alphiiri.com My My junior honey Oh They keep on coming There is a girl in extra white jeans a girl who said was a ton And she's living with the women at the funny Play toys in the house of the ladies First I need a little hot when she was young at a restaurant with a boy You didn't know the she was gay Until he noticed each time they went out She went for the seafood buffet Just look at all was his diec sisters now Just look what they have done She's crazy Dominant she comes home from work to that door Well, half her parents She's gone Oh, we're pulling her she laid it down to stop publishing the rosy bag Let the laid off staff not paid and Rose's girlfriend who's pregnant right now I guess she just only got laid There is a girl with extra white jeans entertainer She's become And she goes by the name of Rosie O'Dee in the house of the ladies It's real 18 at 560 Dominant you have here's a facts from O'Dee the cop Well, I haven't heard from him at a long time and that's good thing I guess he's faxing out and I call him good He says Clinton's departure from the White House caused a terrible leadership vacuum Minnesota was lost to fence citizen after the ridiculous funeral service pectoraly for well stone the Democrats turned off everyone Well, I'll say it again and I don't doubt that that had quite a bit of impact But if that's if that's the and supposedly Minnesota they're like intellectual you know they're educated there better than the rest of us If that's the effect of that's gonna decide what you're gonna cash your vote on then wife father Well, we're gonna add Mark prior in the Arkansas chalk on pump in the Democrat. That was about it. That was the only one And every other single close raise at least South Dakota still like upper grabs. I think with an hundred votes and not finished That looks like the Republican there may eat it out or not tune But all the other close ones Carnan amazurish. He just barely got beat And then of course Catherine Towns and Kennedy and Maryland. I'm gonna tell you the sure how I'm putting the Democrats were Not only was your name Kennedy and she got beat, but this is in a state Maryland where it's against a lot of you Republican I think I mean no Republicans ever win Maryland, but she managed to again grasping defeat from the jaws of victory And what what quantification did she have anyway to be governor? She would know Spurl a-nose 287 votes on a poll. What's your take on Tuesday's election? We're having a party. We're so excited about it. Hudson coming. Yes, he is.

See we pulled one out of our ass But you know you know who feels better about that Tom dashi all these things in all my god is this embarrassing that's like when Gore lost Tennessee, you know But I say post you're confusing a sweep or you know control the Congress with the landslide. I mean This is a mixed election This wasn't a sweep No, no, the country is the country is divided right down in the middle, but but see the thing of it is in election as you know It's like a horse race in a race horse race. You don't have to win by three lengths to be the winner and a same in election If you win by ten votes or if you fix it by 500 You're the winner. So you don't have to have a sweep in addition to which all the power goes on to the basis of number of people in the Congress It's got nothing to with how many votes they won by Well the problem with the Democrats Is that they're trying to be like Republicans it's me too is I'm the trying to imitate them instead of Well, I said that yesterday I said that back in the early eighties Reagan and that was when they first started this with their good right wing Board again Christian friends is to make the word liberal dirty word So all of a sudden the spinless Democrats almost all of them back the way from it. Oh, yeah, we're not liberal And they try to be more and more centrist and less and less a liberal and that's a polycraft What's wrong with being liberal? But the promise they're not offering an attractive alternate right right if they're message they have no mess Correct and And you know unless they do that they're gonna look continue to lose now as far as 2004 I see it as carry and Robert Rubin the former Treasury secretary come on Ellis Rubin I think Robert Rubin the advice presidential nominee. Yeah, yeah, I would be planning that far ahead the way that this administration is going You know, we're on that road armor getting we might get there before 2004 Democrats nominee Al Gore my god. Oh, oh, I see no Not we may have to cancel that order for lunch. I just spoiled my day a little bit please don't say that I love that that Fox news Heather bit that is just that is the great Well you'll be here in at least 20 30 time No, how about 30 40 times. Okay. You got it. I know see you Yeah, he's right if they do so Tim Johnson pulls it out of his ass and South Dakota They Democrats must have found a couple hundred dead people Well, you know it's easy to find South Dakota because there's so much open space. I never been there have you been in there South Dakota Yeah, I've been through there think it's in badlands The band-o-do-do-do-do Which is featureless oh A blank plain or kind of the everglades no no the elder everglades has some animals Oh and character Well, so so what is it now instead of let me if we do my math let's see 48 now that's not right is it 51 I think that's right 51 48 and won the independent but keep showing it over and over and over Well, no, they but they just changed it because if South Dakota went for the Democrats if he pulled it out of it That was closest to which is tight as the witches as Alaska look at that Stevens well, I know who cares about them up there anyway, you know we're gonna screw them up 567 05 60 though this time on 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line We're gonna send grace slick up their first and then the oral slick WQAM How you doing sir? Oh, I'm good kind of you know your birthday will forever be remembered as black Tuesday Well, you know when you get to be 60 I think it in more ways than one you're right Yeah You know I've been pondering this whole situation and I think you right you can't get too bent out of shape because That's the Republic's control this and it's you know the Senate moderating force in the in the Congress anyway While the right wingers are unable to get a lot of their stuff on amended Not to mention of course those right wing judges baby But that that is the scary thing though is that they might be able to get some of those wackos through now because of the majority Yeah Oh, man, you're gonna try to do a chain gang. I know forget about doing anything I would be thinking about anything bad would be I think the thought police ask crops working on the thought police now Like like that thing in Delaware where they're resty if they think that you're a if they believe you're thinking about committing a crime Oh, yeah, that's true. That's indemisated be filing. Yeah They know Mr. Don't be asking any questions. They know they have they it's kind of like Santa Claus They know who's been naughty and nice they've been checking the list twice Well despite all this mess I think the best attitude to take is probably like nearo I'll roam with burning just play the liar and I got my stat of various right now I'm filling on it Have a great day. I'm playing the tune. I'm my straight-a-recent back there. I'm my ain't a love beats and my straight-a-recent I like that Fat boys wamping down a hall there with his walker With his that's good a TV trainer walker. I like that probably only got a girl here him coming from A mile. That's what they say a treasure island score score 560 maybe it's just a grudding and groaning. I guess I might have something to do with it. Well when you weigh 600 pounds I Got to play that the rosy thing again not the one I just played the other one I got a day without that It's like a day without sunshine.

I just don't think you want to support Neil Rogers Well now you bring in up something that's completely different. No. I think death's why I think that's the biggest problem You got you don't like Neil Rogers and you did you wanted to go opposite to him and you really didn't care who you offended Well what what what what what what what what what what what what I tell you what since the man is standing in the controller right now What isn't Neil Rogers tell you Since the day I walked since the day I walked into this place. He's done everything he can undemine this program since when I'm getting down a bad brass tax I'll look at right in the eye and tell him right now to his face I think you brought something that on yourself you blamed I might be even bother arguing Whether I'm appearing on a network show what the hell is that have to do with anything And if the object is To get me pissed off Didn't trust me when I tell you it didn't take 53 a kill You never know who will call Tony Bruno on 940 Fox Sports Radio Our David voice of the Miami And you don't need the game was what but I will listen to you guys every day you guys doing a hell of a job It's fun to listen to and oh Brian I mean the whole thing you guys just doing there's great What did I hear that right back up the page?

I'm star our our static 70 I'm a suicidal 41 and I don't give a Schmidt 26 how do you like that? So anyway working on that meeting for Louise in the Bronx Not right away, but down the road a little bit. You got the word Yeah, well I got a friend there at the a precinct that WQIM Yes, man. Yeah, I love your show I always listen to it. Yeah, I need to touch a pretty point with you Touch around me one One of the things that we published why are you whispering I see okay Hey, one of the things that we publicly have in their event is just that the platform they're together They're not divided and Democrat or I mean inside the Democratic Party Well, if that's the case, I'll come to you with so many Republicans against the invading Iraq Well, I don't know But let me just tell you that there is a The Democratic Party How about Richard Shelby who's that? Yeah, he comes from different spectrums. We have the logo. We have a number But how come Richard Shelby was Screaming in yelling about the incompetence of the CI and the FBI and about the poor job the administration did I work for that You're going I agree with you, but he's a Republican Let me just tell you something. Well, you just want to uphold the big fact now they're all much of but anyway go ahead I mean, you know, I mean the way I see it is that they're Republican party Super super they have a platform they know whether they talk about the Democrats We don't have help anybody the media. It's just pounding at us And another thing is that they're Republicans They have so much money. I mean So much money unfortunately this election was decided Ever since they had that Cheat sale of pennies the Fox News people like we have a lot more dangerous to Well, yeah, and you know what I mean These people have The packet to fill with money But like probably last it wasn't because he wasn't a good candidate. He was it's just that He did not have a lot of money He went for a crappy campaign and then the color before was right the second debate that was what cooked his goose Well, yeah, things have been roster which I lost totally my respect for him I mean did roster pound at my bride and he gave it in a slide to jump bush a few remember if you I didn't watch it. I want what I watched the debate. What I already knew I was gonna vote for why did I I would say didn't vote anyway More than I want I bother doing it No, it's not Why is it a sad day? Don't you understand that the both political parties stink don't you understand that? I don't think we're screwed the average person in this country is screwed and tattooed I don't think so I think they won't have been doing a good job I'm doing what well by promoting I'm losing every key election Under the sun Every time that we want to open our mouth and talk about the economy nobody wants to live They haven't wanted to open them out and talk about the economy. They don't have any plan for the economy All they want to do is say the task cuts were bad and and screwed us up and put us in a recession But they have no alternative they have brought us anything to the table bring it to the table maybe Mabel black label bring it to my table But thanks for the call she's she's too worked up for me. I don't want to get all depressed She's depressed I understand that's but it's not like a football game okay see too many people view politics Hey, the Republicans say we there's a Democrats all a bunch of crooks like that poll says they're look at 103 29% of the people in the Saudi and say what happens does it make it all much a crooks anyway and they're right It's just that some crooks are a little more dangerous than the other ones, but they're all a bunch of crooks And this business and I guess it worked in New Jersey okay But this business up there Minnesota that we're gonna you know dust water out of the mock balls and bring them out Then work to good I thought he was pretty good in that debate the idea that when I saw it, but you know the problem is people don't listen to the substance That's that's America for you when you're dealing with so many stupid people. It's the sizzle not the substance That's right all they want to see is oh this This norm Coleman guy he looks like he's under the age of a hundred and he's still alive and can maybe walk a little bit Walter he looks like he is embommed He looks like they just turn of loose for man and two so as last museum Like I said he looked 74 going on 104 He did he didn't look good plus his speak barely speak you know Not knocking his positions or his politics and just not gonna affect it plus of course remember where's the beef? Yeah, that was how mean it was a good line, but it was a you know didn't do too good against Ronnie Ray gun Then to do this stuff and think about the great choices the American public said these presidential elections. I'm not that we had one, but it just in general Stop and think about him Michael DuCoccus and George Juhuber Walker bush. Oh Walter Mondale and Ronald Reagan Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan Al Gore and George. Oh, yeah, the Bush Don't forget on state level either. I understand that, but that's what it boils down to that's why people say well It's a lesser of two evils well what kind of a guy then country is that there's mondale On his success. Yeah. Okay, Walter good luck to Poor Walter. I mean, I like Walter Mondale. I think he's a pretty good guy, but he's 400 years old. You know it doesn't work too well What were they gonna do they had that they were desperate? And then of course some people are gonna say we did all that playing crashes awfully suspicious I don't think so, but there will be some paranoid the assholes who will say that some people make comedy But it's about that and they will not get played on his show And certainly not too late to stop that check 567.0560 pound 560 on EA. Oh, it is to late on the AT&T and for Eisen wireless line. I'm sure he'd always any time The Bokamester he's not there's that money store right over here. Oh, hey, I'm sure he's goes there right down the way back up the Hershey highway on the way back up the Ho Chi Minh Trail So that's good that at least offers me some hope The fact that there's an open door to this meeting so we can kind of clear the air a little bit Well, there's certain things that are musty in this place. That's a good reason I'm getting out of here fairly soon. It's kind of musty, you know Some hairpieces little musty that cashmere bouquet Who else was it that came in a few days ago and smelled shook my hand somebody I like But smelled my hand at all day long.

I thought you'd be head and shoulders a long time ago. I mean, honestly, who grows hair on their shoulders anyway? Yeah, right. So, what are you using now? Well, it's like head and shoulders. Only without all those additives. It's just called head. Let's tell them about it, girls. If you tie your double-champing hair, I'll be late with you. Yeah, yeah. Just remember what I said. Yeah, yeah. You feel better if you get some hair. Wow, where could I get head? Lots of places, chick. You can stop by my place later and I'll be happy to give you some hair. In 50 minutes, I'll have you shampooed, siled, and blown dry. You don't miss a link, do you? Hands down, green. But is it expensive? Not at all, chick. My brother says there are places downtown where you can get head for less than $10. Dollars. At that price, everyone should be getting head. That's right, chick. When you say head, you set a mouthful. Hi, I'm Dr. Raymond Falad. From Freedom Island Street, here to Killing U. Why you should get head? First, at Lubricates, each limp hair follicle, leading an erect listening shaft. Then the scalp's natural oils are sucked out of the oil. Leading your hair soft, shiny, and exhausted. Nothing does the job like head. Great! Can I get head from my hairdresser, Bruce? Probably, but you might want to try your girlfriend first. So out and get some head today. Get a little work, go the long way. Get your love better and your feel to rip. Get a can, you get head, your lucky step. One hair with lots of volume. Nothing gets it up like head. Available little price, you won't find hard to swallow, and it's going down every day. Honey, we're out of the shampoo. Can you go out and get some head? What did you say? I said, I wanted to go out and get head. Oh, thank you, sweet Jesus. I'm going down down. And head makes a great holiday gift. Last Christmas, my wife gave me some head. Then I gave her a pearl necklace. I've never seen her so choked up. My girlfriend used to give me head, and then we got married. Now I'm lucky if I get a jargon's lotion and a national jewellery. When she starts, she won't want to stop. I can't feel the good. My club yachts have been in the shower. You want to come, and head alone, alone, alone, alone. She can try and have your coat and coat. I can't drop straight in and feel it slow. And yet, let's remember who won I said. I can't feel better because you get some head. You'll feel better because you get some head. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Head shampoo. Come on. Give it a shot. My hair looks great. I can use a nap. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Don't like all the hard burn. Don't go, don't get breath. Time to see.
