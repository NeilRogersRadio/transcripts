My life ain't going great plan to Hollywood's broke. Unfortunately I speak like I had a stroke. First blood came in 82. That's when I heard my penis ended never ever grew. Rambo 2 was in 85 late. Rambo 3 was in 88. Show it and show it and show it and my gun. I get not made this movie with my son. He never said she was in Rocky's life and daylight at all a movie. A little big crashes where I mean. I got a little from the Paulo Creed. I got a half a mile of him movie. Or bloody show like you're a he. I guess nobody ever saw a cop in. It was stupid, I guess I understand. My whole life is about to cave in. Oh I got left in the gentle flame. Ladies and gentlemen, I need to make lamb more fun. 5. Uh. Check it out. So call me up. I really need a script. I can do dialogue or keep it zip. Delight comedy. Action. Adventure. And drama. The only thing I will undo is having sex with a llama. So give me a break. For goodness sake. I used to be an opera. Now I can't get on Ricky Lake. Now I got a one man show in poor kepte. Basically I'm a run in point. Chipsy. A little bit of crashes. What I mean. I got a get a loan from the Paulo Creed. I got a half a mile of him movie. Or bloody show like you're never he. I guess nobody ever saw a cop in. It was stupid. So I understand. My whole life is about to cave in. Oh I got left in the gentle flame. And that's why ladies and gentlemen. I need to make remover. Fire. But I'm absolutely. I know to have five sixty. Nobody came here. Why play that today? I give up. Because if you look at the. Paul from yesterday. Seven hundred and five votes by the way. Bill Connie and gonna fly the rocky theme and Lou Big and mama number five. Or like back to back. Or as they say here's side by each. How do you like that? So I figure that like puts the two of them together in one bit. See what I'm saying? See the logic? I get it. And I just want to say this. I mean somebody might as well talk about the fact that the red wings. One of the Stanley Cup because certainly on a morning sports show. They don't talk about that. Go get these not a lot of speak more than five words per day. That's Dakota. About hockey. Red wings. Nice going Air Boys in five games to be Carolina. No contest. Oh. And another boring game last night. Three to one was the final wasn't a really that close. And what can you say other than their. They're done. And of course Scotty Bowman the greatest coach of all time on a care what he says. He wants to be modest so the toe Blake was better punch your mark was better. Greatest coach of all time Scotty Bowman. Ninth standard cup when he hangs it up. Retires immediately up to the game, which is no surprise. But it was a yeah and see the one great thing about hockey. Is that at the end of playoff series. The players line up no matter how brutal they've been. They've been beaten the crap out of each other and knocking each other's teeth out. They're bleeding. They're like their limbs are hanging and they line up and they like to shake each other's hand. They're like a little hugging. They're padding on the ass by the way. We don't see that. That's it for pussy sports. Not for hockey. And I want to tell you right now my definition of a real man. Okay. If you look up the term a real man in the dictionary. Steve Iserman is a real man. Steady. Here's a guy. Here's a guy to play the entire playoffs. Injured. After a lot of the games couldn't even walk because his knee is so bad. He's going to have to have a reconstructive surgery on the knee starting like almost any day now. And it's going to be up for six months, which means he'll miss a good part of the next season. But in spite of that, there's the Redmond captain. Let him do another Stanley Cup. I thought it was nice to give Nicholas Lutz from the cons my trophy for being the most valuable player in the playoffs. Pretty damn good. Even though it was a very boring series and Carolina plays that comito style and I give him credit. I mean his palm a rease who's got two first names. There are young coaches a lot younger than many of the Redmond players by the way. I think there were eight players maybe not eight. Several players under way to move older than palm a rease. He's 35. He's the coach of Carolina. Almost got fired early in the season. Was right under verge. And Carolina had a home in home season. Hey Robert is Robert there. Yes he is. Guess which team it was they had the home in home series with the same palm reases job. Gee could it be the Panthers? Yeah, we've got good guess. And they kicked the crap out of the Panthers. No one thought I think wouldn't I not attend something like that. Saved his job and leads him right there to Stanley Cup finals. Nice going Paul. Good coach. Does anybody grab out the Panthers? I beg your pardon. Doesn't everyone kick the crap out of the Panthers? Are you going to step picking on the Panthers? I remember when we used to have hockey team in San Florida. We did. Once upon a time, lots of long time ago. And then they'd like kind of dismantle it. But we ought to be used to that. It happens to every team down there. Anyway, so yesterday's before we get to the pool though. I want to we got some great news because we're trying even though we have this oppressive repressive right wing regime led by John Ascroft and the word police should think would be back but the media understand what the public wants. The public wants all seven of George Carlin words eventually. Now we didn't get any of those under today, but CNN must have said the word as six hundred times today. That's right because we got this great story. Singers says A.B.C.'s Jennings gave him the boot. This is the most important story that I forget for one second about the bishops and Dallas. We'll get to that. We'll get to all the other good stuff. We'll get to today's pool and I'll see give you the results for me yesterday. Here's the survivors from yesterday's one hit wonder. Did we owe it? We did break the tie. Look at that. We broke the tie. Did you notice? Yeah, thank God. Vicki Sue Robinson edged out the bugles for number five. Here's the results. Dexie's midnight rotters come on Ileen had 57 to win. Hello. How's that possible? I know it was big. Vicki H1s was too bad. You gotta be smitteny man. Anyway, that was enough. While she played that funky music 51, Thomas Dolby, she blinded me with science 44. That was number three. Number four rock and roll hoochie Kubrick, go into your 37. And Vicki Sue Robinson, I think was tied neck and neck, no one's to know a side by each. For the longest guy damn time, but edge dot the the bugles and video killer radio star. Vicki Sue Robinson Trimovie to round had 28 for number five. We're saving the top five from each day that we do. This number have like a spinoff. A runoff. Whatever. The good news is that Bobby McFear and don't worry be happy. Was right on the heels of those two, but the amount of number seven or whatever. Oh, if that would have made the top five, I think that would have been the end for me. That would have been a thought as a boot as far as I could go with this, but it didn't quite make it back in us. Very annoying. That'd be a good pull to take some day the most annoying song of all time. Oh, and that would be a contender. Here's a facts from Ivan before I get back to my a story. Ivan says, Chipotle is not at the time of chili per se. Now this goes back to the Armidillo Cafe. But I was in yesterday's, I was reading some, I guess I'm going to wait there. Or Chipotle. Chipotle. All right. Are you starting again? Not me. You better not mess with me because I am the call to hellfire. Okay. All right. That's what Motu told me. Chipotle is not a type of chili per se. It's nothing more than a jalapeno that's been roasted. I'm cold to give it a smoky flavor. Once blackened, the black peel is removed and the peppers put on a blender to make sauces. Kind of like it, sounds like a circumcised shfart of the black peel is removed. And the peppers put on a pepper that is put on a blender to make sauces. And in the end, the pepper that is put on a blender to make sauces is understood that 20% of the jalapeno crops in Mexico are converted into Chipotle. What this helps it does. I haven't thank you. As we had no clue what Chipotle was, which is evidently in some of the, in one or more of the menu items at the Armidillo Cafe where they use a lot of weenifty and different ingredients to put together great stuff. Okay. So our list, well, I will get to our list for today. Eventually. And the good news is for those people to get, think that it's ponderous going through all of the end your right. So George and I spent a few minutes this morning and we put together today's list ahead of time including some stuff from 91. Some stuff from 60, what was that year 62 I think? Okay. And some stuff that the audience had sent in and also some stuff from the book of Brian stuff that he sent me. So there's all kinds of good stuff on here. Another good list today. But, you know, Peter Jennings is an asshole. Have I told you that before I think I knew you show him? I don't know. And during the 9-11 and unfortunately, I made a bad mistake on that day because I had to figure out which audio we'd carry on a year to give the information out. Immediately leave the public. And the early part of it we went to ABC channel 10. I have no idea why I did that. And then after a little while I immediately went over to MSNBC because ABC really stunked the joint out that day. And especially Peter Jennings. They took every rumor, every people like that playing that supposedly had been hijacked and was crashed and see at or which never happened. Nobody else ever put that on the year. I mean, that's just one example of the grotesque misinformation that ABC did on that day. It was a horrible job. And why any person in his right mind would watch Peter Jennings with his heavily affected British accent, even though he's Canadian. See, nobody does the news up here sounds like that. They all sound like me, like you. I mean, they just sound like, you know, people speaking English. In fact, like you can other example is even on a BBC, you've seen a BBC and Sky News in England. Nobody speaks with like a heavy British accent. No, just pop up. Pop up. And no, they don't speak like that either. They don't sound pop up. They say they speak just like I do. How do you like that? So, why anybody would watch an answer like Peter Jennings and ABC News. I don't know. I guess just because it's there. And also, of course, it all depends on what local news you're watching ahead of it. And Channel 10 local news has got because people like stories about eating ass. In fact, you know, something maybe that's where that whole ass then came from. Maybe Peter Jennings figures that the right letter they'll talk about eating ass so much that on the ABC even news, they don't want to dignify the word ass. So, look at that, that's the right of the second because it's the big story of the day. Oh, ass. Ask on CNN. I'll say again, if you're missing in a news this morning, which I hope you did, they must have said the word ass. 64,248 times, but who's counting? And they were like, what's that broads name? Which one? The silly one that's on there from 6 to 7 before Paul is on comes on. I mean, she's very good looking, but she's a silly goose. And she's always chart-lin and pippin and whatever. But she was a, it's squeezing herself when she said that. I think she's got something down there that doesn't quite meet the eye. You know what I mean? What do you mean? Well, use your own amount. Use your favorite imagination. You've seen those movies. Oh, chicks with. No, I haven't seen those movies actually. Really? No, never. Oh, come on. I'm serious. Oh, that's right.

ABC's Pitter Gennings gave the boot to country singer Tilbe Keith after the sight and the lyrics of his hits on courtesy of the Red White and Blueward took controversial for the networks for the July special celebrating America. And a lot of people are not only pissed off about the censorship but the fact that Peter Gennings is Canadian 8 and they don't like the fact that some canuckers, you know, like a Canadian-type, like the American, like the American, like the American, like the American. They don't like the fact that they can't give the best of the news. Anyway, that's the version from the Wufneck Oklahoma native ABC on the other hand. It's said, low gistics and a number of other factors prevented the network from booking Keith for its three-hour long special being hosted by Jennings who is as I said only moments ago. Canadian 8. How will this tune play out? The controversy centers on the lyrics of the end of the song, a tough edge tune that captures much of the patriotism and anger that swept the country and wake of the 9-Leven attacks? You'll be sorry you messed with the US of A cause we'll put a boot in your ass, it's the American way the song says. Keith 40 wrote the song initially titled Angry American, Soon After the Attacks is a tribute to his father, and Army Fetterman lost his right eye to combat training mission as Dad H.K. Coval had died about five months before 9-Leven and taught his boy to be a flag-wave and pick-hit, a good old boy. I was re-language when I saw that second-plane at the tower muddled what my dad would thought about it, and lyrs just fell out of me until CNN was stuck back alive. It just fell out of me. Keith never planned to be cordless song, but when he sang it at the Pentagon, the US Naval Academy in for troops serving in Bosnia, he knew it was his duty as a singer and songwriter to release it. The response was so tremendous I said, hey we're allowed to be angry. I know how angry I was when I saw those towers come down, so this is my way of serving my country. Keith said, and if you want CNN's, we'll have blitz-crig reports. Keith said he's got no plans to discuss publicly-dirrowed gennings, but he was outraged after the network-released at statement, which said the country singer would never have been booked for the show. The statement didn't mention anything about Jennings alleged objections. They're saying this isn't about Lyrre content it is. Now, respect my writers in American to say what I want to say in Jennings can say what he wants Keith told CNN. I should play the audio from the CNN piece now, you know it. Just seeing what see how many times they said, ask. Okay. Yes, country music starts, holy heat is flying high with a new hit song. It's called courtesy of the red-white in blue. But ABC's Peter Jennings apparently finds the lyrics to controversial. His network, he'd keep the boot from a July 4th special. Keith talked all about it to our own wolf blitzer and even played a little bit of this song in question. That'll be his cage, and you'd be sorry that you messed with the US of A. Because we'll put a boot in your ass and play American way. They all could suck up. Tell me, but I've got a lot of things to do. Yeah, we know that. Well, that's the lyrics Jennings reportedly objects to. Now, we did talk to ABC, but the network is actually trying to downplay this controversy. Here is what they're telling us. This is the statement we got from them. Quote, why we have cast a wide net searching for performers and considered adding Toby Keith to the lineup. Unfortunately, a number of factors including logistical ones prevented us from booking him. Oh, but Keith says, they hate exactly the way it happened. All I heard was that it came down from Mr. Jennings that the Lerical content wasn't, would not be performed on them. Because of Lerical content, this song would not be performed on that show. Keith says he wrote the song, Soon After the September 11th, attacks as a tribute to his late topic, too, who is an army veteran. And we've been soliciting emails all morning long, Jack, and most people don't seem offended by the word ass, and they think that ABC should invite Toby Keith to perform. How do you like that? How they're not offended by the word ass? And they only said it 622 times just and I want a little tip there from CNN. And notice how she was chuckling and churling and squeezing your leg, he was loving it. So Peter Jennings, you're an ass hole, and this, another pretty piece of crap is what he is. In fact, I would call ABC like the George Will Network is what I would call it. Probably Robert watches it a lot. The George Will Network. I don't know because he's a right wing asshole. Although he does like baseball. Anyway, I guess that's a, that's supposed to make him more acceptable, the fact he likes baseball. At least he doesn't talk about basketball all the time like our morning show. You know, the Stanley Cup is over. They play off sur over. Red wings when the Stanley Cup third time in six years. Scottie Bowman retires. Nicholas Woodstrom wins the, a consma trophy, most valuable player. Steve Eisman is like I said a real man. But you won't hear about that on a morning show. And don't mess with content on a morning show. You won't know why George? Why? You know what he told me? I am the condo, how fire. That's right. And the wrath of Arthur Brown. Oh, that's on a pool today. And I'm George and I like I said put today's pool together. So we don't have to, you know, go through that pondress long thing, which I'm sure a lot of people get very upset about. All the weed only to care. Yesterday's serving, I gave you the top five. The bugles had 27 just missed out to top five, so they don't survive. Bobby McFerrand don't worry about it. It's all over. They can, hey, they wouldn't be told in there until X-Succa's, okay? When I make my copy, that means it's over. Robert took my vote away from here. They would have won. He voted before I could just because he's an asshole. What do you vote for? Fait no more. Which is fine, but they didn't have a chance. Who? Faith no more end, epic. Oh, it's a good song. It's okay. It's okay. They're a good group, but it's better than Dixie's midnight wine. Everything is. Oh, I'm really upset about it. I'm not upset. Whatever you like you like, if that's the idea of taking a poll, if it was just up to me, I'd just say, hey, here's the best one at one, to a whole time. Anyway, Terry Jack's season's in the sun at 24, which is extremely annoying. The small faces itchy, who parked Debbie Boone and you light up my life or tied with 22. Haha, thank God, she only got 22. She could have been dangerous. The Nicarbocca is in lies, the light grooves in a hard brew and shipply won't talk over the line. Easy beats Friday on my mind all had 19. Shine had O'Connor, nothing compares to you and Faith no more epic and Bismarcky just to friend all had 18. Contourist, you love me in the Baham and who let the dogs out, 17. Lou Vega, Mambo number five. Well, you talk about something that was played not just overplay, but played, I mean, to death. Ka, I mean, it was okay, it was a good novelty thing, but man. And then, like I said, the rocky thing, Bill County going to fly now, 14. Todd, but the best news of it is we can complain about the come on I lean, but the good news is with this crowd. Loast Del Rio and the macaroon that had only 11 tied with the double shot of my baby's love with swing of the dadans and am in pop music. Oh, thank God, the macaroon didn't do well, you know? Take a. How could anybody listen to that? And then that was down at people and I love you had only nine. Most of the ladies at his two at only a cornesley and pretty little angelize had only eight. Only eight votes for a cornesley and we had three songs yesterday that had none that had the big none. Which is scandalous if you ask me, Troy Shondale, and this time silver and Wambang Shangaling. And I even played a little bit of that, I guess, which convinced him not to go forward. And David Dundas and Jean's on. Is that how you pronounce his name? Sure, why not. In fact, let's call up CNN maybe they'll start talking about him. Dundas they'll just say, ask a lot, you know? That's the new thing that CNN. Now if they're saying ask this morning, can asshole be far away? No, probably not. Probably Monday they're going to start saying asshole. I'm seeing it and referring to Peter Jennings of course and they'd be right. See even Robert don't watch Peter Jennings. That Canadian? Yeah, that Canadian. Hey, don't be knocking Canadians, eh? There's a lot of good Canadians, he doesn't have to be one of them. Now what tell us this? What is this crap? Oh, oh, buddy. Buddy, hi, buddy, hope you're, uh, a PD Lenny. Hey, you're not my buddy, okay, PD Go away. Go hang out with DFO. Get away from me please. I'm knowing a very, very annoying guy. I hope this copy is better than the piece of crappy in their last last time for the lights. Well, that was the worst piece of direct. Even Todd Dreck never matched that piece of copy. Hey, you both always done there in ourselves department. You know, so new copy would be nice instead of this stuff that I've been doing for months and months and months on end. You know, you try to do them a favor and you do all their spots for a no matter how a marginally account may be. And then this, uh, then they don't want to give you any copy. That's the, that's the part that frost my faddle as you know it. Even if it's one of the very marginal, you know what I'm talking about. I'm sure. What do you, anyway, so we had a bunch of facts is which we, uh, and I did a lot of homework on this yesterday. It's part of that asshole. So this is the lazy way out taking these pulls. What is that supposed to mean? What's lazy about it? It's a lot of God. They're more not that I'm complaining. And by the way, I think I have a little bit better if I gigged in Jim Mandage. But, you know, nobody, uh, there was a long pause this morning when Mo was pointing out that the mad dogs off again today. And that Joe Rose is doing a show from Hoonus one to three. And he said, well, that's Jim Mandage. Does anybody got a better gig than that? And then you heard a long pause coming from the control room where Robert and the beast were both holding the collective breath. Because God forbid anybody should have shed my name on a show. So I think even the mad dog would agree I have a little bit better gig than he's got. Is there any doubt about that? No. No. Don't mess with the, uh, with the more man because I am the kind of hellfire. Don't burn your ass. Just like Miguel's getting, oh, and by the way, be sure and watch your passions today. Miguel's still lying there in the rain and start making it being held down. And I noticed she had her knee and his nuts yesterday. Oh, zombie chariot. Actually, she's getting ready to rabish him. She had her knee and his nuts. Now, that usually means something pretty interesting about to happen. But anyway, and of course, Timmy still can be found the magic whatever he's looking for there. And all the munchkins are inside that hotel. But that's a bizarre show. If you're under a lot of stress, you've got a lot of pressure. You'll like be sure to watch passions on NBC because it'll make you forget about everything else. Let's see, Dave Loggins, please come to Boston. Good one. Thank you. That's that on a facts. Also, in a big country, by big country. And it says, in the singer's dead, we put that on today, right? Yes, we did. Okay. Thank you. I just want to acknowledge these facts, because we got a lot of times. And I forget about it, Tom. Because I don't see why do they keep saying Ellen Parsons project and games people play? Because they're big. Why do they keep saying that? They don't know. They had the Iron Sky, which was, uh, that could be the greatest song of all time. But I'm not going to lobby for that, because we've already done that pull. Hey, if you're a new to the area, we got a place that you just won't believe. Little Kibos in dear field beach. Oh, if you haven't had the boxcard verbers there yet, you haven't. You just haven't had this experience. We can all relate to that experience. And John still added, flipping gallons of sweat onto the grill as it creates the magic that we call real hamburgers. Remember the awesome taste of white chastle up north years ago? Well, a little Kibos has got something similar, but unique. That's right. With great grill onions, pickles, ketchup, must do they serve models gorgeous, skinny little buns.

And again, you learned something else. I feel in life. Anyway, this fact spread from Chicago says some of the songs have some interest in connections to my team. The white socks. Back in early 70s, Fox. A socks organized Nancy Faust began playing Na Na Hay Hay Good by before the weather sparse crowned to Kamiski Park. The song was mostly unnoticed until 77 when the socks had been picked for last, caught fire. It began drawing large crowds. They caught what? Fire. Fire. I am the kind of hell fire. And I bring you fire. It says the fans adopted Na Na Hay Hay is their theme song. Most usually when the opposing pitcher was hanked or a player was ejected. It still the theme's unofficial theme song. And of course, a lot of other arenas and the stames used that. You know, like at the end or like at the end of the series. Or at the end of a game that's like lopsided. I was at the ballpark the night that were giving me a symbolic gold record of steam. It says who by now had broken up and didn't show up for the awards that they sent some erosots, steam band, and sent a few to play the song. Well, about two bars into it, everybody starts singing and drowned out the poor Grang band. Nancy Faust is another one hit wonder in creative way years later, Luis Palonia, a little dream and I feel over the ankies was erected me fist to hotel Milwaukee with the 15 year old girl. The first time you came to Baton Chicago after his arrest, Nancy played. I fought the law on the law one. Also not a roguess was a rigid line because the panties didn't exist in I guess. Because every time Paul laws wins a fight over the upanthers, they play I fought the law and I remember that. I'm sure Robert remembers. Yes. Number Paul laws. The second time she played you're 16 year beautiful and your mind. Lastly, about the small faces, the lead singer on Ichikun Park was Steve Mirriot, who left to form humble pie with Peter Frantan. Mirriot was replaced by rods steward and Ron Wood. Now the stones and the group was renamed the faces. We're a good friend and interesting crafter, not even 940 and we're learning more stuff. Here's one of from Jeff and Lake Worth who says, what about if you want to be happy for the rest of your life Jimmy Soul, good song, but the only problem is Jeff. You also had a top four he hit called Twister Matilda. But you didn't know that, did you? I did not. Like I said, not even 937 yet and you're learning just tons of crapp on his show. It's shocking to me. It's amazing. Here's one that says midnight at the oasis by Mirriomaldaur. Now I'm Seattle there hits. Jenny by Tommy Tutto never was a hit and Baker Street by Jerry Rafferty, who had several top 40 hits. So sorry, sorry about that. And in the other ones, anybody else who fact me stuff, you'll see the ones that qualified around today's list. Like Benny Mardon is Mirriot says, into the night, a hit twice with the same song. You're right. Number one, two times with the same song. I think only the Kingsman and Louis Louis did the same thing, didn't he? I think you're right. That was released about 500 times. So anyway, let's see Debbie Boone Debbie was on yesterday. She didn't do all that well. Thank God. So I think we can, and then this asshole at, you know, semi-discostic thing about you goofball, you freaking goofball, you know, trying to be clever this chronic effects because I recognize the handwriting. He's using the book. Anybody that's using the book? I got the book right here. Look at around all of these. There's some good songs on here. Like just one look by doors twice. But look at around it. I mean, what the hell is that? He's using a book. Big deal. Are we impressed? No. You're not here. Mr. Bigshaw with his thick and broke. So here's the list from today. Okay. And I'll give him a, oh, we got a few votes on there already. It's on there. Anyorodgers.com. We'll take the top five from each day that we do this. We're going to do it about 600 days. Please. And then we'll, you know, and then we'll put him on there for a final runoff. A spin off. Which of these one hit wonders was the best. Big country in a big country. Iron butterfly and a god in a beta. Autograph. Turn up the radio. The crazy world of authored brown and fire. Count five in psychotic reaction. I bet you I have that on here too.

I mean, you write off the bat everybody remembers something stupid with the Nancy and Frank. But she also had, how does that to grab you darling, Fridays, child, sugar town ripped off from the McGuire sisters? Love eyes. A whole bunch of them. So get out of here with Nancy's an actual, okay?

Hey, Ben, I think your house Ben, but wasn't in any place else. And the only version of that that was it was by Connie Francis, which I'd be kind of embarrassed to admit then. And then he's got a list of other ones on here like six of them, one of which is Robin Ward, wonderful summer, which we put on today. All the other ones have got like either they, we're never hitting the first place or they had more than one and do not qualify as well. Sorry Ben, give up while you're behind. Here's one of the most broadest stories. Have you seen this about the teacher that beat the kids with a broom? No, I did not. New York. New York police arrested a substitute TGS day for allegedly attacking 19 of his first grade pupils with a broom handle. First grade, that's like six years old, right? Uh, five, six. Value Nune is 57 last time after losing control of the class, police postman Sergeant Gregory Harold said he faces assault charges. He smacked my daughter mother to Shannon's sapset. He smacked her so hard that he knocked her earring out of her ear. What does a five-year-old kid or six-year-old kid do with an earring in a rear anyway? Comment. SAF told WCBS to be that Nune is beat one child with a back of a broomstick. He broke it and then hit him. These are babies. What gives him the right to hit our kid, SAF said the children were treated in the hospital and released authority said. A woman at Nune is his home identified herself as his wife and said he had been a substitute teaching for two years and that she was shocked by the assault accusations that will we would not provide her name for obvious reasons. A board of education spokeswoman did not return phone calls and, no further information about the incident was immediately available. Nobody's talking. I think we ought to take him out in the guide by the woodshed and just beat the crap out of him. In fact, let the kids stone him would be a good idea. Is now what it says in the Bible something about the substance of teachers who are like disobedient and beat up the kids should be surely stone to that. Doesn't it say that? Pretty sure it says that. 951 at 560 WCWM I'll tell you one thing, anybody goes out there and waste a lot of time and effort trying to buy a new mattress. They also must be stone.

Tonight he gives us his exclusive private story. Why did you leave the morning, you sure? I told CBS that this was it. CBS. CBS. Yeah. CBS.

In fact, Brian Gumball has found a new woman to share his life with. Not long after he separated from your wife, you began appearing in public with a new woman. Harry Clinton. Yes. Let's meet Gumball. Okay. I'm delighted to be here and CBS. So the big question. Did you worry? They cut that marriage. Yeah. That's a big one. That's a big one. I see why not. Why not? Follow from one end to the other. How did I do this? How did I wind up taking that break so early? I must be a little off my feet today. Or I'm just trying to get ahead of myself. Maybe I like to eat that early. I do want to say this. Mad Dog said on, was it yesterday we had the baseball game or Wednesday? In the afternoon. Dressed at me. Was Wednesday.

Because early in the morning, I come running in the middle of a lake. You slap this on and then scream. Wasn't it ever late to tell us, girl? I mean if you can't do it in seven and a half minutes. Forget about it. At an extraordinary meeting on the sex scandal that shaken a Roman Catholic church US bishops to vesteptour a zero-prolance parliament. Oh by the way, WQM I'm here for a lot of deal. See I'll screw that all up there. It's all right. Close it up. At an extraordinary meeting on the sex scandal that shaken the Roman Catholic church US bishops took a step toward a zero-tolearned policy for pedophile priests after scrapping a proposal and would have kept some abusive clergy in the ministry. Bishops met in a closed-door session until late yesterday as they crafted a plan that was not likely to soap will end the crisis that seemed dismissal of resignation of over 250 accused priests in January for a bishops have also stepped down. Final legislation was to be approved today, progress considered unprecedented for a church that often debates issues for years, but then, of course, is scurrying to try to cover it up and make it look good. Last week's initial draft proposed that a priest would be used one minor in the pass could be re-assigned to a parish, though only if he utter went counseling was examined by a review board of the Greek Supervision and publicly disclosed his misconduct. Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said it would be unacceptable to allow abusive pre-to-continue with parish work. That sounds as if you can do it once and no one would pay attention to he said. You see, if I can interject this thought in here again because it's very, very important and can't be said too many times, what we have here is the church making a law. Which is totally unacceptable. To any like law-biting citizen, the church can't decide what the punishment should be. The punishment should be up to the, you know, civil authorities. You pass it along to the police, not them through the Rassen jail, which is where child molasses belong. Archbishop Harry Flynn of St. Paul and Minneapolis head of the drafting committee indicated this left two options, strict zero tolerance, ousting any pre-found guilty of abuse, or a slightly less strict policy of the sort advocated by Cardinal Thedor McCurrick of Washington, D.C. who's one of the real apologists and assholes. McCurrick is suggested allowing some older men guilty of one past misdeed to remain technically in the pre-to but living in close confinement kept out of perishes and barred from celebrating public masses, in other words, keep like in the closet. A less contentious aspect of last week's proposal on our future act of molestation would result in expulsion was expected to be retained today. Yesterday's meeting came after a highly dramatic opening in which Bishop Wilton Gregory President of the US Conference of Visions, bluntly acknowledged that the Visions mistakes helped cause this scandal. Log Gregory has repeatedly apologized for the Bishop's role in the crisis, his remarks yesterday were perhaps his most direct yet. We are the ones who chose not to reproach the criminal actions of priest to the authorities, because the law didn't require this, he said, where the ones who worried more about the possibility of scandal and bringing about the kind of openness that helped prevent abuse. Bishop's also revict him's tell how pain permeated their lives, Michael Blan of Chicago told of joining the priesthood, but leading after trying to persuade church leaders to take action against his molester. The priesthood lost me, but kept the perpetrators at Blan, as psychologists who were with victims in the Chicago large dices. Gregory once again told victims he was sorry for the pain they suffered, and further asked forgiveness from the faithful priests's reputations of in Mard by the misconduct of a few, as he said, right, a few. He also asked Bishop's will guilty of abuse to turn themselves in to Vatican authorities. How much after the police would be good, huh? Yeah, and said to let in the Pope and his arrangement over their cover it up. One of the leaders hardest hit by the scandal, Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law, had plans to apologize to his fellow Proletz at his spokesman Donna Marisi. The National Crisis began when Boston Court documents revealed that law allowed a pedophile priest to continue to serve. That's father Gagan for those who haven't been keeping track. Outside the hotel with the meeting was being held about 50 people protested, the church's handling of abuse cases, about 150 people later attended an evening prayer service that started with the song, Healing River. An opening prayer included the line, failure hearts of your faithful people gathered here, and the hearts of our Bishop's gathered in earnest deliberation. Right. After the Bishop's approval for reform policy today, they depend and take up a second document, listing norms or key provisions that affect church law in America. I wonder if norm can't go beyond that list. These require Vatican approval to become binding on all U.S. Dicees since each Bishop answers to, well, not the Bishop's Conference, otherwise the policy would remain a mere gentleman's agreement. Flynn said there was no time this week to spur a third document that would spell out details on ousting priests that are waiting till the Bishop's November meeting he said. Victims in Independence caucuses meeting here pressed for a further radical demand that U.S. church leaders lobby Rome to remove Bishop's who keep abuse of clergy on duty while ignoring warnings. They're seeing little prospect that they filed a document would endorse that idea, thanks to much sense. The King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the King of the king of the King ofrimmed forces and then forced bombers to go to explore the Cal Dynasty who Wednesdayed Lubbock-Thyases, which in 1998 allowed him to minister in a hospital called the Covenant Health System, the hospital's affiliated with a Children's Medical Center. Yesterday, the local Lubbock-Paper reported that Eramido took a leave of absence from his chaplain duties after Bambock found in this past March. I felt that's what I should go public because I feel that we're not going to remove them said Bambock-Thyase7. I felt the best chance I had of saving kids was to tell their parents about him. If they weren't going to remove him, then I would do it. He said, that's what he wants to talk to Egan about, once a priest is ordained by the Archdiocese of New York, he remains their property regardless of where they were signed. The same principle applies to all child-molistened priests of the New York area diocese, whom melt in the society only to resurface again, ready for action. Eramido got in trouble in 1991 when Bambock told the Archdiocese of New York about the sexual abuse that began to be with 15 and an aspiring priest. The late Cardinal O'Connor removed Eramido from Holy Cross and suspended him a few years later Bambock-Thyase7, who was working at a Westchester County Church and later with a church in Atlantic Collins, New Jersey before he split town. Joseph's ruling and Archdiocese spokesman ignores Eramido was among 3 dozen priests whose names were handed over to the area district attorney. And as Wilning said the diocese of Lubbock was aware of Eramido's troubles in New York and decided to let him preach anyway. Eramido did not return a call for a comment. Bishop Rodriguez said he was unaware of the allegations against Eramido and had taken him on where they recommendationed from Cardinal O'Connor. White-Sdug Montero in today's New York Post. Oiii! Who the hell are they, kiddin' huh? They knew all about it, they kept cover and slipped it out of the carpet and moving them all around in the... And they like a city for maybe they were sharing and I'm going to be there giving tips and firm members. Herald reports parish knew rally to back their pastor and of course this always happens. Every single time. Remember the rabbi up there and voker the child master? Filming all the people. All the people in his shoes said, oh, couldn't be rabbi sminger whenever he was name was. Couldn't be him. He's a wonderful upstate while was him. This happens because the flakka brainwashed. At times holding hands at times wiping away tears, hundreds of parish knew flakta same brian cataly church yesterday to show their faith in their long time pastor the Reverend Jose Nixie, who was accused of sexually abusing an altar boy 20 years ago. Those who attended the evening mass followed by a rosary service and a procession that circle the Westchester church said their belief in Nixie's innocence is unshakable. I can't see a same printed without father Nixie said Jose Losa choking back sobbs in a back pew. A 30 don't don't play that damn rather thing. Okay, that would be in bad taste. You know the one I'm talking about? Yeah, that one. choking back tears in a back pew. A 30 year member of the parish Losa said his two sons were altar service at the time the alleged abuse took place. We are all standing behind him as a family he said. Nixie 55 is one of the most prominent priests to be suspended in South Florida since they clergy sex abuse scandals spread across the country earlier this year. After of St. Brendan since 1982, Nixie has helped build one of the earliest largest perishes with a congregation of numbers 4,500. The Archdiocese of Miami placed Nixie on administrative lead June 4 after receiving a complaint from the man now in his mid 30s who accused the priest of arresting him when it was a 15 year old saint Brendan altar boy. The man's lawyer shoved Stephen said he plans to file suit next week against Nixie, the Reverend Ricardo Castellano's 56 who accused the most in the same man and three others and the Archdiocese too. The fourth priest of in suspended while a lay panel appointed by Archbishop Favillara Investigates, depending on the outcome the priest could be reinstated or removed. The Archdiocese recently confirmed that 12 priests have been suspended over retired since 1998 because of past sex abuse complaints. Nixie's attorney Doug McIntosh of Orlaterdale said the allegations against his client are baseless. Are we going to fight them? Absolutely yes, MacIntosh said. Are we going to preserve his good name? Absolutely yes. The faithful of St. Brendan say they have the same resolve. On behind him a hundred percent said Pablo Favillara, Favillara, plenty getting a man of sign on the front of the church that read, we support Father Nixie. Said Marie Favillara, who's two children attend the church elementary school and are altar servers, there is no substance to this. There's only dollar signs to this. Favillara said she's disconcered by what she described as a lack of information from the Archdiocese. We're generally disappointed by the lack of support the Archdiocese is given to Father Nixie into the parish, she said. Nixie didn't attend yesterday's service. She's been temporarily replaced by the same friend of the associate pastor, the Reverend Charles Peterman. If yesterday's man, the Reverend Francis, the Francis, go Calderon, read a letter from Mixing to the parish. The allegation is totally unfounded, read the letter, Jane, dated June 5th. I'm shocked and dumbfounded, but not painful. I forgive my accuser. He said. Oh man, he forgives his accuser. And that nice? Yeah, sweet. That's pretty wide of him. I'd say. Oh look at this rock and run. He's an asshole. Lonesenian, more of his facts is okay. Rock and run in Medley's a major asshole. I think something to do with those under about music. Hey, guess what? We don't take instructions on how to do the show. I'll talk about what everything I want to talk about. Everybody in your brother wants to hear about the goddamn Catholic Church and his scandal. It's time to have a damn mashed potato. Oh speaking to mashed potatoes, how about Dini Sharp? Now she had more other. Yes. Now look at this. We got a battle going on here for Medley. I thought it was going to be like Iron Butterfly in a runaway. Didn't you? In a God of Divina? That's what I voted for. 16 votes. Yeah, it's great song. Mr. Hollywood relax in 11. Big country in a big country eight. Twisted in sister. We're not going to take it. God of four. Billy's Ray Cyrus, achy, breaking heart. He didn't have an foe. The elegance little star. That's what I voted for. We got three. Now let's see. Oh you know what we don't have under yet. We'll get it on there next time. Next time we do this. Like maybe Monday or whenever I feel like it. Set. What is this? What is this? I don't know. Oh, it's Al Wilson. There's nothing worse than a half frozen snake. I'll tell you that. Except maybe like a totally frozen snake. Connecticut courts held high to abuse. George says, a Connecticut superior court judge accused the state judiciary this week of longstanding complicity in the vices of Bridgeport's efforts to keep hidden from the public the extent of clergy sexual abuse including a church cover up which the judge said is at the heart of the scandal. In a written opinion released late Wednesday, Judge Robert, away to hear this name. Are you holding on to all sides of your seats? Strap it. In a written opinion released late Wednesday, Judge Robert F. McWiny criticized what he called a judicial model of cooperation with the vices is endlessly in endlessly delaying litigation, stealing files and co-ourcing victims into non-eslosure settlements. Isn't that what they call hot dogs at McDonald's? In extraordinary language, that another sold hot dogs at McDonald's. That would be a good name for it though would it be? How come get your McWiny? Yeah. McDeath McWiny. In extraordinary language ended the Connecticut appellate court which is delayed his order that seven boxes of secret documents be made public. McWiny declared that it is indefensible morally as well as legally to get the documents under court seal. Even the delay he said precludes any time live indication of any public right to access this compelling information. Compelling information said McWiny. In this week's opinion and an May 8 order that the records of 23 subtle lawsuits become public, McWiny hint that the documents will be damaging to the church. If his order is appelled on the records may cause further problems for Cardinal Egan, whose headed the Bridgeport Dysies for 12 years, until he was elevated to watch Bishop of New York in 2000 and a little noticed footnote to his May 8 decision. McWiny referred to one case not yet publicly reported. He wrote that one of the defendant priests following at least two complaints of sexual abuse of minors and the diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia paranoid type was devoted to the position of pastor. While so engaged he was accused of further incidents of child sexual abuse. What a shock. What a surprise, huh? God. Thank you Reverend McWiny or whatever had your name is. That is that it. You're right. That is a good idea. How come they don't sell hot dogs if fast food joins? Have you ever asked yourself that question? I have. And I don't know. I don't know the answer. Does anybody like a nice winy every now and then? Every now and then? Speaking of that, speaking of winy joined a big dog Joe Rose one to three today for his life broadcast at Houdis and Pembert Pines. Marlins outfield are cliff-floidably on hand signing autographs along with the QM prize patrol. Plus, meet the beast and Billy the Marlin. He'll be on hand velocity.

From an attempt to 10 at 560, WQN if you want to sensational me a little truly outstanding restaurant. One that's been voted for the past 14 years in a row, one of Broward's best. Here's the place Amidillo Cafe. Used to be on David Road extension in a very unapplusive look in place, and because it became so big and famous and they had to well get a great location, bigger and better than ever. And that's in the piece of La Pasa on University Drive in David, between Griffin and 595 right beyond Piora and inport there. With loads of loads of feet parking and complimentary ballet parking too. The food at Amidillo is out of this world mouth watering. Start out with appetizers like the Tequila Grilled Shrimp with corncakes, the Tempura Island Princess Kong. Their spinach salads are sensational with glazed pecans, pistachio-crusted mozzarella salad with lemon-based aldressing. And what's that word at Chipotle? Chipotle. Now what do they have to Chipotle? What is that in? Jars? No, no, that's one of those salad. Hygroponic arugula with honey-dutto-potle dressing. And you know something, I think the door maybe is a jar. And the entree is man prepared with the best and freshest ingredients. Try the pancier de la Tale snapper with roasted peppers or the sea bass with sweet corn and geoglaise. Lots and lots of great entree. The likes of what you've never seen. That's just your pedestrian stuff and for dessert.

service cop say john a mower saw the problem of a getaway vehicle during a week long robbery spree and suffoc this month's other police said he used a car service police arrested mower 39 of central isle pull of heart in romconcoma yesterday afternoon soon after the robbery of dairy barn on root 25 and lake grove the rest kept a week long series of robberies mostly of dairy barns by mower police said that must be like farm store huh i guess according to police mower used a car service to get two and from his robbery targets and he had the driver wait for him he would put on the skies end of the store's pretend he had a weapon and demand cash he then returned to the waiting car mama's been charged with nine robbers between June 16 yesterday police said he's to be a rain to the in first district court in central isle long island and that great what does wrong with it smart club maybe our friends over the central park limo like to take you on a high swine one on sounds like a great idea all that's good to that cast your story if we must they had a woman on here earlier on CNN did you see that who is 29 year old son blue is brains out of his molested by a priest when oh yes you see the picture yes good looking kid i mean just it's pathetic tears your heart out oh man he was in and out of mental institutions who was molested when he was 12 years old and that's why this whole dog and pony showed it's going on right now it's unacceptable like i said yesterday it's like letting the heads of the five families sit around decide what the you know the penalties will be for their crimes or like letting me a Nazi sit around at noonburg running the show interrogating themselves see and in this again go back to the u.s. their care of interfering with the religion so it's a hands-off thing and you sit back and hope that they're going to do the best which you know that they're not they're doing the best they can't are covering it up and trying to put on a good show and make a look at a really very concerned and apologetic which at this late date the holds no water with anybody with a brain not going to bring back those people are committed suicide or whose lives have been destroyed tragic pathetic just like that market by the way but a market's true really are really last two days make some of us feel good that we finally got out because i mean you know after a long long desperate situation just not looking too good speaking not looking too good looks like Jimmy Carter didn't accomplish hell a lot down there in fact that would be a good poll question who accomplished the most in Cuba Jimmy Carter or the Pope who took part food and toilet paper yeah or they had that they had that conference on the world starvation again i don't know where they had at this time and by totally one year that was in rom and my hotel in lagrand hotel which is a very fancy schmantey expensive in over price hotel kind of a little dump by the way but at any rate and as we walked through the hallways there were all these food carts out there in a hall every night it went on for like you know three four days this conference on world hunger and there were like you could have fed the Chinese army with all the food that they were thrown out because nobody ate it because they were all getting room service all these big shots in fact it seems to me that Castro was in town for that thing but not at my hotel he was there one the other big shot hotels fed out Castro announced the drive to collect signatures in support of a constitutional amendment that would declare his 41 year old socialist system untouchable even Robert stack is in shock untouchable a opponent say the four day petition robbers a clear response to a homegrown campaign that's been pushing for a referendum to demand democratic reforms in Cuba to which he says no and a live appearance on state one TV yesterday Castro said over 120 thousand petition stations will be set up around the island more than one for every hundred citizens for signature gathering campaign starting this Saturday tomorrow no compatriot will be not at the night the opportunity oh he's got away with words of the no compatriot will be denied the opportunity to back the amendments of Castro who has established the social system in Cuba two years after he did power nineteen fifty nine and of course if they don't participate we'll look to them opposition active as said the petition robbers the government's response to their own signature campaign for a referendum in which voters would be asked whether they favor civil liberties including freedom of speech in assembly the right to own a business electoral reform and and this need for political prisoners it's sad that the government keeps feeding the image of popular support fed when human rights activist El Azad al Sanchez said of Castro's announcement Castro said nothing publicly about the opposition campaign which is called the vorella project I must be named after Eliana for Rala must be early antifanilla its back is collected more than ten thousand signatures the constitutions as I needed to propose a referendum in some middle of the national assembly last month but if we see no formal response communist officials have accused the vorella project organizers of being on the US government paywall something the activist deny Cuba to throw his also said that there are legal and tech of the problems with the referendum proposal giving it little hope for success which is the understatement of all time. Castro emphasized that the petition campaign will be organized by organizations representing women university students workers and other groups and not be a state activity insisted anybody believe him no after citizens weigh in there will be a debate in the national assembly will have the final word he said all changes to Cuba's 1976 constitution must be passed by the national assembly the unicamble parliament that's law of the Castro who turned 76 in August has repeatedly insisted Cuba will mean socialist after he's gone and dead his designated successors his brother defense minister wow who turned 71 this month. Sanchez one of the most prominent opponents of Castro's government said he hopes project for well-resene equal treatment of the national assembly considers it a government's ability to mobilize large numbers of people is not necessarily proof that those people supported he said Castro's announcement came a day after he called out millions of people and they do to fully did of course the marching communities around the nation of a million and support the proposal declaring that the system cannot be changed the government said one point two million people marked in Havana alone and the estimates that were sent on CN yesterday seven million people came out in March because basically he made them an offer they couldn't refuse. The march is also meant to protest the speech bush made last month on which he pledged not to ease US trade or travel restrictions until Cuba holds free competitive elections and embraces other democratic reforms most Cubans first heard they were all a project in mid-May when Jimmy Carter mentioned it nonsense to tell about the rest during the visit to the island Carter suggested that the reform plan be published in the state media but that didn't happen and all the changes Carter talked about that they couldn't happen either so he and a public could have saved the plane fair they could have saved the time and the energy and believe me the Pope can afford to waste any energy from the way he's looking oh by the way guess what what your house from Germany he's Dutch he's from Niddler house I just mentioned that is a little piece of trivia read that in my movie book yesterday I like I was we I was reading about the movie the hitter would see Thomas how right and see his girlfriend nearly got the I guess they they wish he was like in torn between the two of them so to speak yeah torn between two lovers Jennifer Jason Lee yeah that was a great movie the hitter it was just good let me say it again it was a great movie all right it was great it was no uh a cinema paradise oh what what are you laughing about just a little kid teeing out the gargoyle then that was a good movie I mean it was very was a tear jerk was very like a motion run the but it was super good had its moments which of these one hit wonders this is our fourth day of this stuff at Boyd it's going over bigger than god damn the six million dollar man in those sandwiches too iron butterfly and a god of the beauty 28 Frankie goes to Hollywood relax 19 big country in a big country I don't I have no idea what that song is do yeah it was big oh what's got 15 I just don't know what if I heard it I probably not then he my doll is into the night he's doing pretty well considering the song was number one two different times 13 votes twisted sister we're not going to take a D heaven 10 van McCoy and a hustler's got nine and then it's Billy Ray Cyrus oh you know I'm not saying that there aren't good country songs because over the years I mean Johnny Cashins had some red songs Marty Robbins a white sport coat in the pink carnation that was great Bob Lumen let's think about living which you still remember what that song that was corny but it was okay 1056 at five 60 WQA and what we got a lot of crap here today I'll get I'll get to all of it can I get to all of my crap?

It don't pitch the 10th much. Now I'm sporting a wordy. I'm finding it impossible to conceal. I'm sporting a wordy. I feel like an absolute hour will. So the goal is to go this. He was sporting one too. Follow him up to the gate to praise him. Just to see what he would do. It's close to the pace you could be even. As if he had his father's room. There's a pretty little ghost. She's waiting for his post. Diamond with John the Room. We're sporting a wordy. It's a man fest. It's feeling impossible to conceal. It's calling for this man fest. I feel like a natural without a wheel. Spock wood is in their best. It's almost impossible to conceal. It's what it would is in their best. I feel like a natural bow. Yeah, I got confess actually like the upper body better than the original song by a long shot. Yeah. But nevertheless, it's not doing all I crazed. I got five votes. Mark Colin C-O-H-N. Okay, curator what's not with the E in there. Like Roy Cohen. He didn't have any in there either. Although he was Jewish and obnoxious and disgusting. Fact. Probably one of Roboteros Roy Cohen. Just a joke, Roboter. Don't get out tied. By the way, speaking of a Robert Egor Lerian, I've really pisses me off. He played so great in this series. All of a sudden a guy that he wouldn't even break into a sweat with the Panthers and he goes back to Detroit where he's playing with all these great players. And at the age of 41, all of a sudden he gets like a second youth. I can't stand guys like that. What is an asshole down here too? Yeah, I realized I didn't want to do this, didn't want to do that, didn't want to play the system. Maybe we were real smuck. Egor Lerianov. I say send it inside Burya. It was very emotional seeing constant team out there holding up the couple last night. Who has made tremendous progress inside horrendous accident. Where he got paralyzed and a whole deal of a limo accident. But the drunk and driver. He held up the couple last night. He could actually like almost stand up and he's like, you know, he's making it slow and painful. But that was pretty emotional to see. In fact, I usually not all wrapped up in a post, you know, final game, Sir Monizala crap. But that was pretty enjoyable there last night. It was okay. And seeing Scotty Bowman flopping down on there. He went and put on his skates. As soon as the game ended and came out there was skating around with a cup. Scotty Bowman, nine Stanley Cups, he retires. Anybody talking about that on our sports shows? No, no. Mad Dog will cause he picked the red ones. Which was really going out there on a limo. Oh, that's right. It's not under the. What a bad break. The mad dog is not working today. Who picked the wings to win the cup. Hundreds flocked to Gotty Wake. John Gotty was given a send-off. Be fitting a mob chief. And yesterday is scores of mourners. Packed a mass-path funeral chapel to say goodbye. Have you heard that before? Mass-path? No. I have no idea where that is. Somewhere in New York, of course. But I don't know where that is. Gotty, the one time boss at the GameBeean organized crime family. Gotty got a cancer money as we all know by now. And a federal prison hospital at the age of 61. But visitor standing among dozens of John reach yesterday, were told he wasn't really dead. Do not stand in my grave in weep. I'm not there. I do not sleep. Said prayer cards given to those attending a private wake at Papa Verra, funeral home. Do not stand in my grave in cry. I'm not there. I did not die. But Gotty, wearing a solid blue suit and a matching tie, he had in one since going to prison for life in 1992, was laid out in a closed gold coffin, flanked by a pair of candles flickering behind red glass. Maybe he's like Elvis. Maybe he's still alive. Although I think he is like Elvis. Lorna's filled rows of chairs as others filed through the chapel. On a table near the coffin, stood a collection of family pictures. On a glass coffee table was a frame photograph of a tanned smiling gotty. He went out like a star and king like he wasn't realized. So Louis Casman, a family friend of refers to himself as Gotty's adopted son. I'm telling you where they like the mobsters in New York. Apparently. In the article and every New York paper since this man, Crop has been glowing and glowing and sucking and they like him. And yes, we had a few people kill that he was a scumbag in some ways, but he never stole a freight train. Just like the same way, Marolanski was so well-liked there when he was in Hellenale and on my mebeach. He used to walk his little dog. He was very nice to be old ladies. He was polite. After the first viewing, a Gotty brother, which of you gotty, 59, a reputed crime captain, a couple. Left a funeral home with a group of men and dark suits. And strolled to a nearby sports bar, matchmakers for a drink. They probably had a quick drink on a way to Louis in a Bronx. Probably had a hat like that when you were wearing the last week. A fedora? When a purse by photographers he said, you already got enough pictures of me. Surprisingly didn't take the camera out of his hand like sunny and smacked it on the ground in a few 20s. Gotty's widow and daughter, both named Victoria, did not leave the funeral home between afternoon and evening viewings. Before the 7 p.m. viewing, pizza was brought in for the family. Did that ice? A little stereotypical. Why is that? Pizza? For mops? I wonder if it was like the thin like real Italian pizza or if it was like that the thicker was the sillian. Inside were numerous tributes to Gotty. You know, the sillian's got no sauce. You do know that, don't you? I do know. There's a Gotten Osa, no cheese. Say I get confused. I think it's got no cheese. It's just got sauce and oregano. No cheese. Inside were numerous tributes to Gotty to the chief redicard on a wreath of red and white carnations. Another board of name of Gotty's old hangout on Ozone Park, the Bergen Hutton Fist Club. John, we love you red and other card. You will always stay in our hearts. The wakers to continue to dance if you're in a home on Grand Avenue, a small brick and stucco building. Just opposite to gawling or triangle, a memorial for Mass Beth presence, killed in World War I. Very ill as scheduled for tomorrow morning. Although the wakers opened the public reporters were brought from the funeral home and had to watch from behind police barricades. The dices of Brooklyn is ruled of Gotty cannot be given a Roman Catholic Mass funeral Mass, but may be in Turd at St. John's cemetery in Middle Village, a memorial Mass will be held after the burial. Gotty is to be in Turd at the family in Wazelim with a son Frank Gotty was killed by Elwano that. Richard Reebok and attorney was often represented Gotty family members and we sure like his shoes, said Gotty's son John A. Gotty will not be attending the services, because the son is serving a six year federal prison sense for bribery and extortion and did not seek permission for a leave. He's asking for no favors from the government at all Reebok said he will grieve in his own way. Also missing in the proceedings are two other Gotty brothers, Jean is serving a 50 year prison term for heroin dealing and Peter who's been held without bail on federal back at Turing charges. Among those paying respects yesterday was Chuck Zito, the former House Angelou spent six years in prison before Tony actor. The style of the HBO prison show Oz was later joined by Gotty's longtime attorney Bruce Cutler. Also attending the wake was Liz Roby 25, a moved man hadn't had the last make from Nashville where she was also a first grade teacher. Since coming here she said she's attended an operand central park, participated in the five kilometer walk along the Hudson River and toured the U.N. She decided to attend the wake because she likes random life experiences. And of course that's one of the things that gotty was famous for like having random life experiences when some people is expected of you. I mean sometimes it was their last random life experience but nevertheless he never stole a freight train and we like monsters on the show. We like them mob and that's the way I had the other day about how they were and they want to recruit new members. We want to know how do we get in. Especially me because in my age I'm not going to worry about being along and off to run out. So how do we get in? I think you got to cut your pinky off. I see. Pinky that's with a P. Yeah. How's that pull coming by the way? It's just just refreshed. Iron butterfly and a god of debate a 31. That's pretty long to a net about five minutes. It's an entire album side. It's like 15 minutes. Oh that's a head there's the one the extended cut that goes out the way about that. Seven hours. Like if you have wild wicked diarrhea that's even better than a car through park. Frankie goes to Hollywood by relax 21. The other way around. The other way around. I know. Big country in the big country. And that one I had a big country is the group and in the big countries that I'm in the saw. 17 and the elite singer still dead. What was his name? Big Wilson. Yes. Hello big. Well he was a good guy. What was that the New York Statehouse and Laurie Sussman's also dead? What is a lot of dead people around? Marty Sussman New York Statehouse. How about you Hank knew him? And Big Wilson. Well that's right. He worked with Big Wilson and I would do. Do you know the first I was thinking about this yesterday the first time I met Hank. I was working at KAT. This is really, I wasn't working at KAT yet. I was doing like weekends on IOD. Bill Carter got me in an IOD after I left Palm Beach. And Larry King invited me to be on the show. We were talking about gambling and peer mutuals. And Phil Sussman was on at show. It's the first time I ever met Phil and Hank was there. And a guy named Sigshai who was another degenerate gambler. And that's the first time I met Hank. That's in 1975 or 1975 or 1976. What am I looking for? In a big country pop group from Dunfirm, or from, oh I can't say it. Dunfirmly in Scotland. Stuart Adams in vocals in guitar. Bruce Watson guitar Tony Butler bass and Mark Brzind and Brzicki. Brzind and Brzicki. Drum. Don't say anything about them being dead here. The guy that actually did. Huh? That's an old book is it? No, it's like from a year ago or so. My way at Stuart, he could be dead now. It's that wasn't made yesterday. So he could have died like in last week or two. It doesn't say anything in my book about being dead. And there's the names that are all Scottish anyway. So they probably were a bunch of kills and were silly guys. But it's a very popular song. Don't say nothing about no dead guy in there. See, I mean, we got a lot of great faches on this. But a lot of misinformation too. Brother, a lot of wrong stuff. The problem is past 11 at 560WQM.

Wow, a lot of this stuff. You're so old anyway. That's the way it goes. Great music. We're talking of a period of over 50 years, man. If you're going to be like a real music fan, you got to know all kinds of music. Going back like to the early 50s. Do I write about that or what? I mean, don't have any way. What? I'm just kidding. Of course you do. You're not in. Oh, wait. I'm using 1850s. You're not in 50s music, I'm a. It was weak. You're not in fat stomano. Oh, I love fat stomano.

Just to piss off that pdoer magic. What's that guy's name? Bob Hamilton or something like that? For he pisses me off, man. That could be a good station, but it's not. Even Ricky Ticking knows that, but we don't want to get in trouble. Speaking of music, couple Susan T.V. over Croats prank. M.T.V.s been slept for the $10 million lawsuit from a couple who said they were surprised by a fake Croats in their hotel room as part of a hidden camera prank for reality TV show. James and Lory Anne Ryan of Washington DC also named the Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas in the suit, but there's a lot of beautiful people laying out there. That's what Joker's tell us is. How do you think of it? We're been in the Hard Rock hotel in Vegas. Not me. It's on the corner of Harmon Avenue and the paradise, whatever that is. I think. Don't buy it once. Yeah. I've driven by many times. If I stay close by there, many times in some of those sweet places there on the Harmon Avenue, some of those places are great. See, the advantage is stay. I don't want to get sidetracked with Vegas here, but the advantage is stay in those kind of places. Is that first of all, you take your way to Korn your park right outside your door. As opposed to walking through 80 miles in a parking garage to figure out where you stayed. See what I'm saying? Very convenient. And you don't have all the 80 million people laws. But on the other hand, the only problem is if you want to feel like you like to get in a mood like Tungier brings out. It can't just go downstairs and gamble your guts out. The suit originally filed in Los Angeles and April the getting public attention as week after was moved. The federal court said the couple became unwitting participants in a practical joke, and the decision for a serious unadveloped enough TV called harassment while they were on vacation in January. So I guess asshole or whatever that show is. That wasn't good enough. Jackass asshole. Now they got harassment coming up. We need to victimize people for entertainment. Upon entering the hotel room, the Ryan's discovered what appeared to be a dead human body covered in surrounded by blood. Evidently the victim of a homicide is hidden cameras recorded their shock the suit says. Is this incredible or what? There are posses. Come on, they should be. As the couple tried to flee, two actors posing as security guards blocked their way in a third individual in the guys that are a paramedic entered the room. This is sick. This is really sick. The show's host and coproducer Ashden Kutcher, who's described the series in interviews as a guerrilla style candid camera, finally emerged to reveal the prank. The Ryan's were not amused. They're seeking $10 million in compensatory damages against MTV, the Harbac Hotel and Kutcher, who's also named in the suits of the attorney Daniel Rosanski. Both the cable network which is owned by a viacom ink and the privately owned hotel declined to come in on the case for obvious reasons. An MTV spokeswoman said the incident in question was filmed as part of a pilot episode for harassment which is not air yet. She said the features dead as the program is uncertain, I can't imagine why. Her assman is not the first reality show to land MTV illegal trouble. Two teenage girls who didn't work in April 2001 after they were sprayed with human excrement. By performing as builders the shower range is doing a program called Dude The Sucks. MTV apologized for the incident and promised never to wear footage of the incident. That's it remains in litigation. The girls had profiteally attorney Gloria all red told writers. Remember Gloria all red? You have the media horrors on every two minutes along with that Markella goes for the mustache. Which is not good to say. I don't see him anymore. Thank God. Can't pick him off my TV. Speaking of MTV, New York Post reports after 11 seasons road rules is often running. When it premiered in 1995, was a spin off of MTV's other wildly successful reality series The Real World. The audience often lumped road rules as The Real World on wheels. I never enabled her to tell him a part to be honest with it. Road rules. And it went a big up. Because I think most people, if I ever come across those shows, I'm just looking to see if there's anybody who looks good on it. If not move on to something else. There was the first season. There was the first reality show with challenges long before bug eating on Survivor or Fear Factor's as its co-creator John Murray probably. The location of the show have changed over year by the angstness still the same. This season we have Eric the All-American boy, Dill the boxer with a temper, Still are the independent wild child, Rachel LaHeartbreaker, Kendall the Sad Angel and Shane, the show's first openly gay man. It's a distinction that James Perkins are exactly thrilled over, while Shane is cool what the revelation being made on national TV has parents are not. It's not that they don't accept him. There are frayties that Homer Thorke viewers may try to hood him. Still Shane says he didn't sign up to make any social statements for him it was all about the journey. I don't think reality TV equals start him, so the 21 year old who attends the University of North Carolina wants to guarantee the production. In fact he's working as a waiter. How are you, usual? A gay waiter? What a novelty. He's working as a waiter in Doer North Carolina to the summer to make ends meet. So to speak, he has no grand dreams that road rules be anything more than a nice diversion from his regular life. I watched every season of real world, every season of road rules he says those shows practically raised me. I know all the participants names and what they did and who they did he says. That's the joy reality TV. Oh yeah, reality TV. I love that term reality TV. I love it. The joke. Twenty six after eleven at five six all by the way, what's his name, Tom Greens upset because Drew Burmour's school and somebody else? Ben Lewis, what that word says to our five minutes or something like that. I think that him having both his nuts cut off. I don't think anybody actually believed that. No. No, I didn't believe it. It was even worse than the jailer marriages. Twenty six passed eleven at five sixty. WCM-Hey, let me tell you about an amazing place to little kibos. If you're new to South Florida, you probably never encountered this place. But when you do boy you're in for a real amazing surprise. Because crazy John is still dripping gallons of sweat out of the grill. As he pumps out those great little burgers just like the white cats and burgers used to enjoy up north. They stay with you for like days on time or once in a while if you're lucky they move right on out. The law of kibos burgers have those great grilled onions, pickle, ketchup and mustard cheese if you like. And they serve man those gorgeous steaming little buns and believe we either few things in the world as great as steaming little buns. The law of kibos also, you know who likes steaming little buns? By the rule too. That's what I'm hearing. The law of kibos also serves those thick coming out island cut fries and sobrettes hot dogs with all kinds of good He's on them. Great chicken fingers, wings and chicken sandwiches too. And a tasty fried fish sandwich is always a good diversion and perversion. Little kibos you can eat in draft fewer than one of the stars on the patio. Why do they watch the help stare at the train going around and around overhead? Or maybe just up at the sky looking for help. The law of kibos lunch in dinner seven days week fighting in Saturday open late till 10 and you'll find them on power line. Roach us out the Hillsborough Boulevard. Tell that PD Lenny sent you by for a real culinary delight. I don't care what movie says about the meat guys. A nice big gift that keeps on fucking. You a jam. It's why they you best. Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story. We take a good hard stiff look at the start of. They burst onto the music scene with a song so catchy. It virtually guaranteed their failure. They were the knack. We caught up with neckly vocalist Doug Feger, who's life now consists of explaining who he was to board strangers of parties. So I understand your a musician. Yeah, I was in a fan called the knack. Oh, I am. I'm not hurt of you. Well, I'm sure you've heard the song before. Ow 213 Guy My friend Us A The pretty dream all in Danders' Massachusetts. Free can neck. That asshole dug head is away with me. And do I see a penny in royalties? I only hope that Hig is been in the rest of his life explained who he was to bore people parties. Now but, he would be sweet revenge. There you go, Charona. It's the least we could do. It's a big juicy, soft and wet look of your business tonight. But inside the behind. How let me ask you stupid question. How come we didn't put that one on there? Was number one for six weeks? They might have had two. Three. Okay. Good girls don't cry. Was number number number 11. Baby talks dirty. I bet you don't say ass though like they do on CNN every two minutes. That was the big story of the day that country western guy who's all pissed off and fired up about 9-11 and did that song. He was supposed to be on the July 4th celebration on ABC. And Peter Jennings is, oh no, you can't say kick kick boot. It's the crappy ass. Something like that. That's what he said. Something like that. And Peter Jennings said, oh no, we can't do that on ABC. And so they kicked his ass out. And he's pissed off and fired up about it. And CNN is using the occasion as an excuse just to say ass all the time over and over again. Pathetic. So we can't, it's not a bad song. I saw that on CD that almost brought the other day but there was nothing else good on it. And I would certainly not buy a CD just because my sharona was on it. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. No, it's just not. Yeah, I don't think so. I'm just bringing blue jeans to be a B-shake. It's not. Oh, and that's it, that's it. Thanks. My voice moves to New York from California. Bad wins. The York's the Lone Town. And of course, you keep seeing it like that. It'll be a lot longer. Not to good. I think our butterflies guarantee. Don't you think it's a lot? My personal opinion, it could be wrong. I don't think so. So, 1134-26 to Luna 560 WQA. And it looked like something from a sci-fi flick, a mysterious silver orb. Three feet in diameter floating in the surf off the South Carolina coast. This were ABC news. For Peter Jennings, a continues being an asshole. A pretty good at issues, earlier than now, asshole. They thought it was a giant beach ball. They were going to bring in, said Marie Signeurie, whose family found the orb, floating there, the redded beach house at the Isle of Poms. They swam out and said it was very heavy ball. It was metal head numbers on it. And there was no way they were bringing it in. Head numbers on it. Maybe we know it wasn't water, and I don't know if it was. Rover was made out of metal anyway. I saw the prisoner again. That's how one of these 80 million channels I got. Prisoners on their all-time. The one where he went off into boat he thought that they were escaping. Yeah. And then come to fight out the people from the inside run about with them and turn down. And then they unleashed Rover Adam and Rover like I said in my pack. Anyway this ball eventually washed up on a sure causing alarm residents to call the police. A thirties marked off an area around the orb with crams seen tape and tried to identify. They turned to members of the Air Force Bonnesquad, the Coast Guard, and state officials for helping nobody could identify the strange object. There were numbers on the surface of the orb but no other clues that helped determine its origin. NASA and the National Oceanic and MSF were contacted, even they had no answers. As if its weight, several hundred pounds. See they described it as a ball. I mean they're no ball that's like several hundred pounds because of its weight. Their speculation it might be a floatation device used by a dredge company but the theory only adds to the mystery the orb's got no fasteners on a were a liner cable might have been attached. We're calling it a UFO and unidentified floating object. That'll have a bomb sparrow chief and Graham to the AP. According to the Associated Press the orb cracked in half as it was being brought to the Huns Public Works Department but the inside was as revealing as the outside only sea water is spilled out. In other words all the little green men got out of their alaiya gas alive. Did you always wonder where those people in South Carolina came from? There was nothing green, nothing glowing Graham told the news agency will probably just go to the scrapyard. We just have a big ol' ball with a number on it. I guess. Speaking of that. For the first time astronomers have found a distant planetary system with at least one planet whose orbit resembles a member of our solar system. You see the only reason that we're not talking more about life and because it's all matter of time and space and this whole other you know that's what it's all about. Right. Because there was no question that there's been life on a lot of the planets. No question. Maybe some like man some more advanced some more primitive whatever because but of course we're talking maybe millions or billions of years apart. That's all. Get it? Jeffrey Marcie of the University of California Berkeley and Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institute of Washington City yesterday. They have found a planet about five times the size of Jupiter and Jupiter has pretty guy damn big. Circling a sunlight star at an orbital distance very like that of the solar system's biggest planet. The newly discovered planet is one of three planets surfing a star called 55 Cancree that's about 51 light years away from Earth. Oh we should be there by one o'clock. Oh this is the first time we found a family of planets that has some similarities to our own solar system or city estate and news conference. The new planet circle 55 cancree at a distance of 5.5 after 9.00 units close to the 5.2 a orbit of Jupiter and a U is the distance between the Earth and the Sun about 92 million miles. The two other planets around 55 cancree are also Jupiter or Saturn sized bodies but they orbit much closer to the apparent star kind like Josh Friedman like Saturn sized body. One is an orbit of about 9 million miles the other is about 23 million miles. Marcy and Butler also announced they found 13 other planets orbiting distance stars bringing to 91 the total number known of extra solar planets how little we know and across this off flies in the face of all of religion is too because it pushes all of that crap right down the toilet you know it. Don't forget what it says there he made the stars also. Yeah come on can after thought well it was pretty barren up there which certainly shows me that the people are wrote that crap and of course it's supposed to be direct from God they really had some great wisdom man to relate inside. Just a decade ago the concept of other stars having planets was in the realm of science fiction noted and kidney director of NASA's astronomy division. The Marcy Butler team is found most of the 91 extra solar planets the group uses a technique that measures the very slight wobble of a central star and then uses the magnitude of this motion to determine the presence of orbiting planets the size and shape of their orbits and their mass the technique works only for larger planets and can't detect those much smaller than those about half the mass of Saturn. Marcy and Butler said they had a hint years ago that 55 cancue at a large planet in a Jupiter like orbit but to confirm the conclusion required measurements for at least one complete orbit of the planet. The new planet takes about 13 years to circle its star close to the 11.86 years it takes Jupiter to orbit the Sun. All other extra solar planets discovered up to now orbit closer to the parent star and must have been a long-gated exhibit or are eccentric orbits said Marcy this new plan orbits is far from its stars our own Jupiter orbits the Sun. There you go lots of planets lots of solar systems lots of life and they aren't like little green men from Mars although they could be how do we know maybe they're like not green maybe they're like I don't know maybe they're charters how do we know what they are? We're stupid that's the problem we don't know much but we like making up a lot of good stuff because it makes for good science fiction writing I have the Ray Bragg Ray theater on my one of my channels on I think it's on that screen TV.

said bill weaver one of the lawyers for those who filed a suit he had other lawyers and said the nine level attacks have somewhat overshadowed the August seven nineteen ninety eight embassy bombings which took place ten minutes apart and killed two hundred thirty one people including twelve Americans the suit is about trying to rebuild the lives affected by the first wave of the of attacks on american soil said another lawyer john eaves junior a relation to Joe Marston here the government had had its military response but we want to jury of the people to get the message out that we will not tolerate terrorism he's added the suit found the new us to be caught in Washington ledges that been lawden directed the attacks which will finance by a host of his lawmaker organization is for governments among the hundred sixty four other defendants hundred sixty four hey let's read them all now just the most important ones on the time of our tiff a senior in lawden to believe them in killing us bombings in November and also all the walley who's another senior in the by the way we still have found his family was killed in the bombings but we still have got no idea where he is more about all mar the founder of the Taliban Afghanistan who's where about to get a well known who slept to our fingers numerous times over there and a bunch of other a go ahead speaking all that more depressing news i have to do this to go into the weekend but lack security let's tell us travel authorities who rated this witty jumble in slow vaki of refugee dormitories are haunted by what they didn't find thirty shadowy men they fear may have been terrorist posing as a silent sickers this is the edema refugee camp in slow vaki the suspects vanished among the corn fields and oak forest that stretched to the austrian border a few miles away now officials are trying to determine if terrorist amassed waiting his refugees to get to the west we had information that members of al kai to the Taliban were trying to infiltrate these refugee groups said yaris law spissiac no relation to the ars law spot check one of silvaki's top police commanders told the ap acting on an interpole report by a relay bible giri or were the thirty entered europe slow vaki and he took as command was rated at a mob on march 12 by the time the special forces burst into the camp five evon and papai is after the group survival the suspects were gone germanies equivalent of the fbi the federal criminal officer was checking to whether some of them might have slipped into Germany security is laxed refugee processing centers like adam all because the ginava convention for bids governments from treating asylum seekers like criminals as a result there's little to detour terrorists no guards with machine guns no surveillance cameras no high walls no razor wire you despissiac narrated for but elaborate on why they thought they thirty could be terrorists official said they had conflicting your council whether the member afgans are Arabs but they were traveling in a group and it paid about two thousand dollars each to gain transit from boggillia to slow vaki more than twice to going late interpole would not confirm a report in the frankfurter algaman zeit to newspaper setting european intelligence that the men allegedly intended to rent apartments and high-rise buildings in germany elsewhere in place bombs inside the slow box later captured one says police for lack of evidence of a taken another refugee camp within days he disappeared again just as most afghan refugees been outreaching western europe eventually do since the collapse of communism hundreds of thousands of people of used eastern europe as a transit would including Islamic men who came mostly from the middle east to fight on the muslim side and the boznan more governments have been unwilling to titan security of refugee camps for fear of violating the human rights of genuine asylum seekers desperately fleeing persecution it goes to show we're really taken as crisis seriously all over the world outweigh last year more than any one hundred people most of them afghan's applied for asylum in slavaki alone most can buy a Ukraine Bulgaria and hungry we can't turn refugee camps into prison so it brought out for sell the vector of slavaki is migration office that would be the worst sort of human rights abuse we can't assume that everyone fleeing afghanistan is a member of al-Qaeda or the Taliban although allowing themselves to be photographed and figured pretty as a solemn sickers would be risky it also goodbye to risk time in an air of legitimacy that might get local authorities below the guard if it's possible to detain an al-Qaeda member chicago's airport it's possible here said Vladimir bellow cabin another migration official that's why we need to start paying attention in Bulgaria official screen asylum afghan's for possible terrorist although not have been spotted so far we can never be a

american bright is the first former governor of the boys to run for real governor florida speaking of no contest as he got an in-chance oh janir we know she got a change no no i'm tony man the democratic party don't have to worry Robert just a calm we couldn't win a fixed election unlike you guys i'm extremely calm guy i'm sure you are well especially getting out of there in a couple months Roberts leaving qa into which we say uh regulations are hard-felking regulations moving out of a real life getting out of that psychotic place returning forty years after his teenage election McGrind offered some political lessons yesterday for this year's class at boy state the biggest one is clean play McGrind the group of not throwing at fsu clean play on that's a good place to be talking about uh clean play as fsu or they never met a gangster they didn't like there is too much partisanship and too much infighting too much people going at each other said McGrind was elected governor by his voice day class of 1962 is that the same voice as the one did Timothy uh yeah thanks oh too often that's what happens in politics everybody's looking at the false in somebody else he said in his race against former u.s. attorney general janir reano for the democratic nomination for governor McGrind pledged to avoid negative campaigning in other words he's not going to talk about who falling down all the time and being a little shaky and he's not going to show pictures of that little kid in the closet should he get a chance to run against republican governor javoshe's who jetted later he'll campaign against the governor's plans not the person he won't be talking about the governor's daughter and all those prescriptions and his two sons were like hope the crazy than a bedbug first two out of chance to address voice day doing it's week in the capital a voice risk convention which leaders had to manage boys attempting to delete the orchestra put in the fsu auditorium the bids class also produced another politician u.s. representative alan boy to monocelo i didn't know we had a monocelo and thwarted you know that nope where does it i thought it was in New York or by the racetrack since its inception the nineteen forty voice day governor is a run for a speaker of the state house and a president and congress how about Marvin maker at monocelo but mcri at a temporary law is the first book governor to go for the real thing my opponent forty years ago was an eloquence speaker mcriad recall adding a dash of humility apparently a lot of people voted for me because they wanted to make it a close race he has got a child in stance he's not going to get the nomination and she ain't going to be jett boy no chance not little chance not slim not next to none no chance okay very sad oh and speaking that here's a good follow up to that al-goura plan strategy retreat al-goura plans to compare notes with tab democratic fundraisers and members of his old campaign team at a strategy retreat later this month as he weighs another run for the presidency and you know the other one they keep talking about hope julee brun oh uh... the guy the guy the guy who a personality retreat yeah the guy and no he needs a personality transplant is what he needs both of them fact they didn't get a package deal there's the guy that helped make sure put the nails in a coffin make sure that he lost any one of the seven states all of my grum states that good julee brun not just a julee but one of those a bible thumping orthodox jules all he needs is the talusonia and the yama could like complete the deal as they say and then of course there's always raffnator but he's busy with the NBA the two thousand democratic presidential nomadies some of them in a way Memphis Tennessee session

love to see it not what he graber the other would he Memphis is going to be an opportunity for many old and some new friends to get together within the uh... financial backing for many national democratic campaigns in the past burger said they stood side by side before or as we say up here side by each this is an opportunity for them to get together and be with Alan tipper and discuss the state a democratic politics currently in the future i'll tell you the state of democratic politics just melted not too good burger said it's clear that goes interested in running for president again noting a strong performance in two thousand he got more popular to vote that anybody sends Ronald Reagan he said the gathering was expected to include former staffers now i said just Peter night also the birthday financial firm of metropolitan west Elaine comac who teaches at Harvard University and leon furth a visiting professor which was washing the university associates and the reprieve on the

iodide pills this week from a North Carolina company to protect people from cancer caused by radioactive iodine which can be released in nuclear explosions the agencies are stockpiling the pills in case of a nuclear event said good and john drove a spokesman for the office of homeland security it's been an ongoing effort john were said adding that it's not a direct result of the rest of his a padea that's suspected al-Qaeda member of a planing a dirty bomb attack in Washington the government orders monday in two day represent nine percent of new pills dot com's business this year and were 18 percent higher than the companies total two thousand sales said owner Troy Jones private citizens are buying him as well their stockpiling in two thousand and whoever heard of potassium iodide Jones said Thursday until then his only clients were survivalists and those who live new reactors after nine eleven many people ordering the pills that protect the thyroid plan from radioactive iodine a cancer causing agent it can be released in huge plumes and atomic explosions don't the peacocks have those huge plumes yes and there is matter fact out by me there in the acres there are people that have peacocks yeah and chickens and peans no some serious and they like who are crawl around in a road and getting you waiting to sit there waiting to cross the road and they're very arrogant about that and they're very noisy because those people who live in a particular area i don't want to get the two specific but they think they're still not in the country i think if they like crawl out from under the bottom of the house someday and go out there and summarize bullet about luck around they realized that life is passing them by and they're not living in the country anymore i could i could be wrong about that i don't think so you've been out there you think they're living in the country right or no not no more so give it those damn peacocks anyway the orders of nearly over one jones three person sales team since monday went attorney general john ascrop an ounce patee is a rest and everybody's there going like that however experts believe a dirty bomb it released other kinds of radiation potassium iodide which sells for about a dollar a pill would be helpful only if a dirty bomb used radioactive iodide instead of other radioactive substances and then only for people close to the explosion people are buying this product because they think they're going to protect themselves from a dirty bomb jones said they're buying it because they think something worse is going to happen to this country such as an attack on a nuclear plant or a suitcase nuclear bomb john rose and go in that far but it knows the government's making large vise of potassium iodide the purchases were made by agencies including the in our sea the federal emergency manager an agency the Department of Energy in the Department of Health and Human services the FDA approved over the counter sales of potassium iodide nineteen eighty two it recommends that anyone exposed to radioactive iodide i take one tabla daily for up to fourteen days and recommend smaller doses for children john said he was getting about one order per minute and most of the new clients were from the washman area the paedia arrest you said was a wake-up call another as people are starting to get like a little bit nervous kind of like that like i said you got yours yet no no didn't we used to sell it when we sold salt the divert we talked about this selling salt iodide salt right that's not just as good what is that i saw it salt with iodide in it now is that good i guess i can't hurt it's good for you you need to certain amount of iodide in your out of the diet in fact we used to take iodide and when you when you take iodine i'm not recommending this but if you take iodine and put on your wrist yeah it disappears no it's a body of warps right and it was the the greater your deficiency in iodine in your body the faster it like such it in like magic yeah and of course people are realized that but the skin is like a tremendous receptor so she she met that you rub by on your skin now i didn't say it what you

happens right now a woman off the two stop after the rectum's i wrote which dot and in the summer the same verb is a hospital and we got a possible hostage situation to go shooting and ran in randomly into a hall okay and what do we know about the condition of this corrections officer as of yet we don't know yet he was rushed to a local hospital to come by amy jackson hospital where he is undergoing treatment but evidently very fortunately for him he was at least able to derive himself away from the shooting scene uh... to the scaffolding imagine and with uh... able to get help for himself all right soothing candy on the telephone there from the Miami area as investigators are now looking into a shooting that took place in the coconut growth section of Miami just moments ago and we're still awaiting the condition as he heard Susan say of the corrections officer who was shot in the stomach and police around the coconut grove home where the suspect is buried to be hold up along with possibly a woman and children will be updating you on that i'm sure you will but there you go more uh... another good example of why everybody should have a gun this guy this guy this stop he just stopped as directions you understand and he on the right side of his car and he got into a scuffle over a gun which it's not clear who had the gun originally whatever and then uh... guess what he's a shot in a luckily he was at the car running and he was able to get some of the hospital immediately and hopefully he'll go survive there you go boys and girls another great example of why crazy people would gun not necessarily such a good idea but that's he american effort away and they can have a good change here's your fact that's very impressive i was thinking about this watching a game last night since i just want to reinforce the fact that steve ijemen will ever be a superstar because he's too small as buying his bm now we know i call him bm library when he was in south from because he's small like it in the acted like it wanted idiotic comment that he made right to my face it's too bad for steve he'll never be a great player because he's too small like i said there's a real man for you steve ijemen leaving his advanced states to look for seven zinid like ten years ago pretty close looks pretty good to me and nevertheless played through all those injuries and the entire playoffs phenomenal gonna have knee surgery now be out for up to six months they said but still managed to play right through the last game last night helped him when the cup a lot of people thought he'd get the MVP again but they're spread it around necklace lottio was the first european player ever when it comes my trophy which i think that's good because it'll piss off down cherry so what does wrong with that nice gun air steve y and ice go on all the ways in the skydiving quits for sure a lot about that on a morning show this morning and then they got the husk but in the protein gully steve there would have got to be on monday that just it may as me so in other words the prizes are going to be uh... all these uh... panther oriented stuff but got for bit we should talk about hockey on a show just said to me on that morning basketball show that we've got but anyway just move right along okay i'm wearing a putt on the crap conservative priests in van koevers anglic and dyesy said rejected last days proposal a kwell of civil war over the blessing of same sex unions the anglic and dyesy said new west minister faces collapsed today as it's governing body of set the world of whether to prepare a right to bless same sex unions i'm overponent table trigger a formal split in the dyesies see we got some crap going on up here to a all this is over there in bc i have a feeling it's going to be a very painful day for all of us at revincarclio a spokesman for the dyesy's conservative caucus i pray for a miracle so god can halt his train wreck before it kills people's faith the caucus yesterday we've been in temp i'm bishop michael ingham to a preventive partition of the local dyesy salon theological lines over the contentious issue of blessing game as being unions expected to pass that the dyeses in sin of the day a first in Canada ready for that i'm ready i'm going to pass in the bc today they expect bishop and impropos that a conservative truth leader be appointed as a visiting bishop to provide pastoral care to any clergy felt they could not receive adequate care from a dyesy's leader who bless the same sex unions the proposal also calls for conscience clause allowing perishes that cannot support the blessing of same sex unions to bar such blessings from their congregation refer me also these concessions are inadequate it's counter-descriptory said it's counter the word of god there's no place for sexual activity outside the covenant of mirage we can't ignore god's word it's not negotiable it's counter the word of god he said refer revincarclio will table a counter motion of the if the plan of the same sex unions passes it calls for a formless split of the dyesy salon theological lines to establish a new non-geographical dyeses dyeses comprised of eighty perishes in 25,000 congregates in salon western bc is known for its liberal tendencies with a vocal conservative minority today's vote comes after a divisive five-year dyeses in battle in 1998-51 percent of delegates at senate support of the move to gay and lesbian inclusion in 1991-56 and a half percent supported blessing same sex union bishop in him twice declined to implement the directive because the margin of support was so narrow however in a letter written to delegates yesterday he announced the pain and frustration of gay and lesbian members of dyesy satley slowness of progress third full inclusion of the church ah so there you go whether they like it or not we're doing it send your wax held you saw the store a couple days ago

little tiny step progress boys and girls getting back to the story his death left his family and investigators struggling to explain what happened was it's suicide or an accident or maybe he's just a crappy pilot and to know I left no noted in family had sent to a spokesman that suspects mechanical problems caused the crash but the NTSB said Wednesday that the preliminary investigation found no obvious mechanical problems with either aircraft the husband or county medical examiner's office is a waiting toxic county tested terminal they've been drinking or under the influence of drug so far the office has only said that antinourary dot of head injury suffered in the crash the sheriff's department is also investigating we may never know what happened of sheriff spokesman Rod Reader said

I have a shy bladder then it hits me these other guys next to me must think I'm a tool gaser damn so I get more and more nervous one time I stood there for hours I'm at some pretty nice fellas though comforted 550 here is some of the most disgraceful news I've ever heard in my life let's discuss those guidelines what the Vatican officials also feel a little bit uncomfortable with is that those bishops are actually deciding on on rules and regulations if you want which none necessarily will have the backing of the Vatican and therefore can the Vatican may not accept zero tolerance policy how do you like that all the other plans yeah well not only that but probably clean out the old am sure they won't have any a pre-slaught through any bishops and the comment is in this report on CNN right now that the bishops in the Dallas are acting as we all know but it's interesting for them to put it in these words they're acting under tremendous pressure because the cat is out of the bag the whole scandals out of the closet so the racking under tremendous pressure because people are saying ah this one one strike and you out the so are you don't get one free pass of listing our kids but the Vatican may not accept zero tolerance policy what kind of crap is that typical unbelievable Jesus Joseph and Saul man so what goes to show you just at a time when they're trying to put on his big PR campaign and put on a great dog and pony show for the public at least give the appearance of really trying to put it in all this crap they're not going to do it because the Vatican won't sit still for even that shaky old Polish Pope he had going to sit still for it i mean who the hair how are they to be making policy policy comes from the Vatican which is their own little country over there see they think the dealer would like the kind of a neary over here in the you know the state police and they can like dictate law here and they've been doing pretty good for a long time the public isn't going to sit still for that and if they if that flies what they're talking about now and if this whole thing that they're trying to pass today if this wind up getting water down you ain't seen nothing yet baby you ain't seen nothing yet the fool is really going to and these victims are going to become apoptctic the lawsuits are going to fly like crazy even more than ever before so chronic tenon primitive pines who just can't control himself he says the music from the fifty sixties and seventies is some of the best music ever made you are absolutely correct and i wasn't even around the last seventies he said there never be another era like that and the stuff will be remembered much more than the freaking nineties well of course there just was not a good music in the nineties except the course for ninety eight degrees i think the reason no one's voted for the cheater is because stupid say that's why i played a bob cubanir i find maybe the cubans would like it he said no one's voted for the cheater's because stupid stations like magic play the same twenty songs over and over again that's it the great songs but even great songs would be played too much i've heard so many great songs for my parents songs that i never heard on magic well that's because magic sucks him magic blows it blows their playlists 14 songs and after he heard those 14 songs each about 14 thousand times after that they stick in a little bit stale about a how great they were then tingles on the say there's a beetle song called little Anna never heard it on magic one out did you ever hear little Anna no i never heard that either i don't think there is a beetle song called little Anna maybe that's why we didn't hear it on magic you know what song he could be talking about what i don't know i'm that's a man who i thought of that when i read it i try well let me take a look i mean the people's only have about 600 listings i'm sure in my book here so this should take no more than four or five hours a ten year bug in me ten little Anna i don't think so and if it was it made of an account one of their albums but i don't remember we're hearing it my funny my body lies over the ocean anybody seen Anna i'm looking for Anna anybody's senior don't see that bitch lovely read it ill enter rigby lady Madonna lady vagina the pallet of john and yoko martyred yeah free as a third i don't see it
