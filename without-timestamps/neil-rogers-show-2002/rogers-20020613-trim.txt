I'll take it from shady to the way I figure this dude will be a butcher man and they are rap singer, a little bit of me and some more a sage figure sounds like a kind of life to make my life bigger. Fortunately, this white MC figured out how to get rid of success fully. It's amazing for shady to debating how to get rid of the more old it's me they're hating, what about this dude? No words, this CD. I don't copy things basically. It's basically the face to be in the case like me is shamelessly doing things lazily and crazy. You buy my music face, boy. Sure, don't hurt empty because of me. Now, if one's no wheel job for me to write a tune for my CD, you should get the song right actually, page up from minutes. When I release, I keep things easy, layerically with the rhythm based on simplicity. Then I sit and count my royalties, score shelons or empty because of me. I would have been bad taste if I said that I would pay to watch Eminem rape Debbie Boone that would be bad women. No. Who would be that? Anyway, Bonnie Tyler somebody says total eclipse to the heart. Now, she had three hits, sorry. Nice try, but she had three hits. Looked up in my book in my billboard book and my billboard looked all make mistakes except about what was his name. Gee, you know, I wrote that down somewhere too, just to make sure I'd have it. Rick, Rick something or other. He was born in 1945 and Sagittal, I'm Michigan lead singer of a question mark in the theory in 96 years. I have that here as a matter of fact, 96 years, but we'll have to wait on that. Just I'm just overwhelmed, you know, overwhelmed with crap. I'm in need deep in crap. For example, here's a suggestion from a listener. One hit wonder, it says, how about Bobby McFerran and don't worry, be happy? How about it? Well, I'll hold one. How do you remember it was the old channel four, which is now on channel six? Remember they did a TV campaign based on that song? Yes. And that's when we really began to hate both of the way. Everything can everywhere. We just started hating the whole world once they started playing that too much. Cause it's annoying, you know? Overdone, overplayed, run into the ground. I'll tell you one thing, whoever does the whistling on it, song is sure couldn't whistle like Pat Bowen's speaking of the boons. Remember, love letters in the sand? Yep. Did you know he did the whistling on that? I didn't. I wish I would. In the middle of the song, well, that was Pat Bowen. He not only sang it, he whistled it too. He knew how to put his lips together and blow. Anyway, here's a fact that has a few suggestions for us. Well, let's see, is there anything else on that scene that's worth giving a shot? I just got all this Catholic pre-stuff that things going on in Dallas. The Dallas News has got a 75,000 page report and expose. We'll get to it. Just calm down. I'll tell you what else is on here that we need to hear immediately, if not sooner, that did very well our survey yesterday, by the way. You know what it is? Oh, they put it. Yeah, that did pretty well. Something that was a novelty song, but we liked it. Yes, right? It was cute. It was cute. Not as cute as Clark Kent, but it was cute. Speaking of Clark Kent and turning Japanese, somebody better Tom don't yank that thing too hard to pull right off his body. Just think about that for a second. Anyway, here's a poll that says it's rainy men by the weather girls. I'm going to have to look that up. They don't have to. They don't have to hit any other hits. Oh, see, just like there, only here even though this is a beautiful studio they built for me, it's limited space. You know what I mean? I don't even. So I don't have the, uh, back yesterday, Robert said, where you are banging on that dump button and I said not intentionally, but if you saw the location of it, it's very possible like it accidentally dumped it, bumped it, bumped it and dumped it. What am I looking for? The weather girl. I don't even see the goddamn weather girls. How's that possible? Why somebody faxing us to lyrics to you like up my life? Some asshole, probably probably a Debbie Boone stalker. Now, let me see, it's, it's raining men's got to be in here, right? And guess what? What? It's not. It wasn't a top 40 hit. It wasn't a top 40 hit. It was just a novelty tune that they played at gay bars. Right, right. I can't believe that. And then what's your name we did it from the Spice Girls What Theals in Jerry Hall of All Read Down recently? Of course, that was not in this country. Was it released in this country? No. As we were discussing off the year before to show there's so much good music, which never gets released in USA. So, uh, tough luck. Anyway, it's raining men doesn't qualify. Play that funky music white boy by wild cherry or possibly black cherry. And you are absolutely correct on that one. And it is wild cherry, even though both are white and made a mistake on it. What both are Brian say? Ever did white and. Yeah, not the average white band. Welcome. I'm telling you, send me some great stuff. But boy, you're all over the place. I did about 45 hours research just since yesterday. Uh, getting the ones that actually qualify. Some were not even, uh, hits much less, uh, time 40 much less. So one hit wonders strawberry letter 23. Now who did that? Don't we have that in here? Some other brothers Johnson. And what did we decide? Uh, I think they had more hits. He said that way. But I don't know. You looked it up. I remember you looked it up and I can't remember. I already researched it because it's how I'm the bulk of Brian's. It just calmed down for one second. See, this is too overwhelming. If my vast staff. If I had a staff, let's see, strawberry, uh, feels forever. What am I looking for? Strawberry letter 23. I don't know. We just don't have time to pick with us right now. Oh, Mickey, you're so fine by Tony Basel. Didn't we play that the other day? Yeah, we wouldn't you did. Thank you very much, but we wouldn't dig the five up. Putting that on it. Come on, I leaned by Dexie's Midnight runners. Yeah. What about it? It was a hit. Okay, good. Okay, we got more important fish to fry. Let me before we get more of this music stuff. Okay. So I'm watching the news yesterday and they said the Dallas morning news yesterday. And of course this bishops meeting is going on as we speak in Dallas. I may be the daughter of the second. Maybe they haven't put their altar boys back in a, uh, back to the bed. He had it on head. Anyway, Catholic bishops and sex abuse, there's a lengthy article. I didn't realize quite how lengthy and expose the Dallas morning news yesterday. You can go to their website and take a look at it. Uh, the reason I'm saying look at it because it's much, much too long for me to go into here on the ear. The essence of it is this because I started downloading this yesterday and in my fax machine says page one of 136 and I said, Oh, I don't think so. I don't think so. Roughly two thirds of top U.S. Catholic leaders have protected priest accused of sexual abuse and a systematic practice that spans decades and continues today a three month Dallas morning news review shows. The study, the first of its kind looked at the records of the top leaders of the nation's 170-8 mainstream Roman Catholic diocese, including acting administrators and cases where the top job is vacant. Excluded from the study, where auxiliary bishops who enlarged diocese servants have boarded at rules, but can still vote on many matters before the West Conference of Catholic bishops. The 17 bishops who lead, Eparkey's, whatever that is, what's an Eparkey. Kathleen. Which are diocese like entities that worship according to the Eastern rights. See, I have a part in the answer to it. In checking whether a bishop had protected priest rather church representatives accused of sexual abuse, reporters Brooks, Egritton and Reese Dunkeln relied on published reports, court records interviews and church records obtained in civil litigation. Most protected priest were accused of sexually abusing minors, primarily adolescent boys, but also younger ones, and a sizable number of girls of various ages. The newspaper study also covered behavior that indicated a sexual attraction to minors, such as viewing child pornography or in one case, trading sexually charged emails with some of the priest believed was a minor. And then it goes on in the next to the 75,000 pages. And I wish I did have time because then I would have printed it all out. It's got the diocese locust. For example, the first one, archbishop Roger Schweitz, who's head of the archbishop of head of the, or diocese of Anchorage, Alaska. One of his top aides is the Reverend Timothy Crowley who left the past who was job in 1993 and the diocese of Lansing, Michigan, after being accused of sexual misconduct with a boy, church officials in Anchorage recently announced that they knew about the priest passed. See, that's just one. That's the first of about it's Zillion. So two thirds of the, this is like the Fax Grining the chicken coop is what this whole dog and pony show that to put on right now. Because two thirds of these guys are already, should be in jail. They've been looking the other way and knew what was going on and that didn't do a guy damn thing about it. In fact, moved him around so they could most somebody else's kids. I just mentioned that in passing. Frank, a dog Montero in the New York Post, one of our favorite comments on his show has got a great column. They church has blood of suicide victims on a chance. We'll get to that in a second and we'll get back to our one hit wonders. I have a play today, man. I can barely carry it. 26 after nine at five, 60 WQM. Here's an easy question with an easy answer. If somebody offered to give you hand over to you, several thousand dollars over the next few years, would you accept it? Damn straight you would. If he's stupid not to do it, which makes it really stupid, the past up the opportunity to refinance or buy a home at 3.95%. Here's the deal. There's a fanty made program available 3.95% for both refinance again, purchasing of homes. Think about it, just 3.95% and all you have to do to get the information about how this works is just to pick up that instrument. You're as make one easy call or the phone, if you like. Call 1-800-940-5363. That's 1-800-940-5363. It'd be more specific. You can borrow 100 grand with payments of only 475 bucks a month or borrow 200 grand with payments of only $950 a month. You'll save yourself a Schmittload of cash, so it'd be downright stupid to pass up a chance to do something smart like that. So do the math and do the next logical thing, do the smart thing, get the details with no obligation by calling the financial group at 1-800-940-5363. That's 1-800-940-5363. There were an equal housing lender, credit restrictions do apply and rate the price. God, where there are no loose, go straight to hell. We're taking it as an cans, I found a secret little place to lock myself away. I'll just take some time, feel it and then do it with my manhoods, write everything everything will feel alright, everything will be alright. Hey, I should feel ashamed when I'm turning butter all alone, you can't come in, you can try right now, just beat yourself, so you'll know that you have been missed up with no one else. You just take some time, feel it and then do it with your manhoods, write everything everything will feel alright, everything will be alright. You just take your time, feel it and then do it with your manhoods, write everything everything will be alright, everything will be alright. You know I couldn't find it? Why? Because I wrote it down on the sheet, I wrote it on the disc, okay. Rudy Martinez, board in 1945, and Sagittal Michigan, nice going. Finally got one right anyway. 96 years, great song, only got what it get? A few votes, I'm not going to go back and get that thing out again. Yeah, yeah, not have more than that, I think like 10. I've heard about it. I've heard about it. A lot of suicide victims on a Tans writes Douglas Montero in the New York Post today. He says the Catholic Church in the United States is up against the wall. That was evident yesterday when two heartbroken women basically accused the church at as bishops of manslaughter, five years ago these women would have been called blasphemerous, blasphemers. But yesterday in Dallas were about 300 bishops are meeting to address the church's growing, priest's sex abuse crisis, these women were sought after. People are listening thanks to the 700 journalists here, people are finally getting the message that when it comes to sex abuse of kids, the church isn't as holy as it pretends to be. When at Patterson 58 of Kansas is want to take down the church, she just wants people to know her 29-year-old son Eric blew his brains up on October 29, 1999 because of predator priest abused him 17 years earlier. Priest sex abuse is deadly said Patterson, who spoke calmly holding a photograph of herself and her husband kneeling by their sons grave. All his life he tried so hard to please God and he always came up short, we came here to speak out so others don't feel desperate and alone. He's angry because church leaders allowed her sons attack her to function as a priest, although he abused others before. Patterson as a website where relatives of priest included suicide victims can post information of what is it priest induced to a side victims can post information about their cases and document church negligence. The faces of the spiritual leaders of Catholics in New York were plastered on a newsprint page like so many mug shots. Below their names were listed details of how they allowed predator priest to infest communities, and the good Terry Light 50 yesterday was in tears, the calling how her friend and fellow victim Mary and Lovelace 55 committed suicide two years ago in Las Vegas, a priest raped her when she was 17. Light cried an hour before she and other victims were to meet with members of the US conference of Catholic Bishops and Hot Committee set up to develop a new priest sex abuse policy. She cried because when she and Lovelace met with a similar and hot committee in 1994 in Washington, the Bishops were falling asleep listening to us she said. The committee this time will stay awake. There's blood on their hands and the devout Catholics in this country know it. Right stuck my terror in today's New York post. I have so much priest stuff today man. I got priest coming out my ass. You know what? So do all the other boys. Oh brother. All the before we get back to that just we can spread it around a little bit. Yeah. To talk about good religious hate since that basically is like a repetitive redundant religious hate. St. Louis Missouri the new head of the Southern Baptist convention has rejected calls to repute it with a Muslim group is calling bigoted and hateful statements made by one of its pastors. The Reverend Jack Rayne elected the convention's president just on Tuesday said the Reverend Jerry Vines comments about Islam were accurate. Vines a former convention president who'll conventioners at a pastor's conference Monday that many of this country's problems problems can be blamed on religious pluralism. The pluralists would have us believe that Islam is just as good as Christianity but I'm here to tell you ladies and gentlemen that Islam is not just as good as Christianity, Vines passed our first Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Florida, told several thousand delegates of the gathering at St. Louis. Islam was founded by Muhammad a demon possessed pedophile who had 12 wives and his last one was an Inyral jewel. And I will tell you all eyes not your whole way either. Your whole was not going to turn you into a terrorist that will try to bomb people and take the lives of thousands and thousands of people. I guess you forgot about the Crusades and the inquisition and things like that. They forgot. Abraham, Cooper, or a spokesman for Washington based Council on our Islam, American Islamic relations said the comments were outrageous. It's really unfortunate that a top leader in a mainstream Christian church would use such hateful and bigoted language in describing the faith of one fifth of the world's population who were set on Tuesday. This is the level of bigotry that requires a clear statement from the top leadership of the Southern Baptist Convention. Graham of Plano Texas said, Biden statement is an accurate statement that he would not condemn his colleague. How do you like that? I will not respond to Dr. Biden statement other than to say that anyone who follows any path who wants to go to heaven should look carefully at who they're following and what they believe he told reporters when you merely spoke to them for the SB6 second committee. So the comments were made outside the actual meeting and that it was not the SB6 place to comment. Ingrid Madison vice president of the Islamic Society of North America and a professor of Islamic Studies at Hartford, seminary and Connecticut called called the comments, meet evil. She said statements like this from such a high place religious leader can lead to violence against Muslims. It makes me wonder what's the hateful religion right now that we should be worried about she said. How do you like that, huh? I like it. And as they just continue attacking each other or attack and attack in my religion's better than yours. Any real Christians in a real good people that I really believe is please stand up. Kind of sounds like something that John Aschrop said a few weeks ago. Remember that? I do. Yeah. Fashes pig. Right wing crazy son of a bitch. But anyway. So getting back to our good music here. See, I got to like segue. Not like it. I like it too. Bricks it up a little bit. Now what that was else was on it. I guess nothing else, huh? I wrote you down by the way, just. Well, we already got 96 tears. We did that yesterday. Okay, so let's not repeat. And we already did this one too, but since it's on here. Yeah. But we didn't, did we do this? Let's write that's right. I'm sad and blue. Okay. Yeah. I can do it. I'm lost. Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? I'm not. I'm not. I remember writing this down. Well, I'm looking at both of you. I'm just saying it one more time. I don't see it. I don't see it. I don't see it. Now, even right that time, it's a silly song, but people like it. Who did it? The Pippkins. Pippkins with a PPIPKI and as Pippkins, you don't know your Pippkins, Mr. I'll tell you there right now, Guy Pippkins. No, not the pumpkins. How about the smashing pumpkins? What the smashing pumpkins said yesterday? All of them. That's what they said. People, people, and I love you. This is a great song. Yeah. All of it takes forever to get going. We listen to it before the show today. For about an hour. At the end of about 45 minutes, it finally gets going. We can do the weather report and the lost dog. Yeah. How'd you like to do the talk up on this baby, huh? Nothing a crickie, Tiki, Fliff, his cap. I don't wreck, Shaw. You're good, Guy, and our book. You're okay. I'm understilin' for a train. Okay.

And believe me, we're not even close. No, that was good though. Hit a post. Hit a post. Hit a post. But you hit a post, huh? Yeah. Jim Mended it, you want to clock? I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Great song. Well, it sure took a long time getting around that, didn't it? Yeah. But this room was a war. That was it. Pacific Gas and Electric. Are you ready? Mid-Died, Mid-Died, Mid-Died. You know the songs? Yeah. Is this what we're writing this down? You bet you've made a sweet ass we are. Or you could also, uh, subtitle it like, do you be ready? But I guess it's, I guess back in those days, they didn't speak like that. What year was that from, you know? Yeah. Like I do. Are you ready? Are you ready? Pacific Gas and Electric. Baby, we got the old gas. 941 at 560, that's what John Ascrop is probably going to give a lot of folks to. The gas if they don't watch out. Hey, fathers days come in just a matter of days away now. Make dead feel special by getting in this year, a comfortable new pair of bad Levy shoes from our good friends at new balance stores with locations in Pine Cransht, Avenger and Boka where they've got fantastic and be the home of the world's best at Levy shoes right now as I speak and right now until the Fathers day by any new balance shoe and get you a free cushion support in soul. That's a $30 value free. And of course the new balance shoes that I'm wearing, see, I didn't say it right now because I'm barefoot barefoot and like Robert Parker. But I think about Robert Parker for the list. Look it up. I'll have to look it up. Anyway, when I do put on those new balance shoes and I'm out walking around on the streets and all over Schmoring around as my mother would say, especially in Amsterdam, it was a double stone streets. In fact, everybody's going to be going on vacation. There's summer almost everybody. And when you're going to be doing all that walk and you're going to have some great walk and shoes, that's why new balance is the place to get it. And you always know you're going to get a perfect fit because every time you go in there, the train foot fetishes and specialists at new balance measure it the old fashion way, the length and the width they want to take a good hard look at it and your foot too. New balance stores with three great locations in Miami's Conquest, the second floor of the Heaven to Ramal and the downtown center in Boka, or you can check them out on their website at www.miley.com and don't forget, until Father's Day by any new balance shoes and get a free cushion support in Seoul and Tom at Neal Center by, but who are they because they are. See you there. And Kathleen's G9 sweet legs and tad on Sports Radio 560. QA-Yan. I don't believe that. The whole thing commercial was childishly edited from its original form into our own preverted version. Any resembling of an actual commercial about this program is fairly adolescent and in a way of filling it with the advertiser, but it doesn't like us laugh. Is there a better way to experience intimate cleansing? Now there is. Introducing vaginal cleansing foam. It's so slow and creamy. It kind of tastes like miracle whip. It's unlike any doof towelette, wash or soap. It takes the rust off the trailer hitch. It gently cleans away wetness even odor without rinsing. It takes red wine stains off the white carpets. After all, a woman can never feel too clean and fresh. I feel too fresh. Heck, could we clean donuts on our own this fresh? New badges feel cleansing foam. From vagus. But you know what that sure sounds real good right now, don't crispy cream donuts? Yummy. 946 and 560 WQM. We got our regular lineup today. Well almost we got the Mad Dog at one Hank at three in the studio. The big at seven because there's no Marlon game I guess. Why did you pound it? Can't see you last night. Then what was it Robert? 13 to 5? See, he has no idea. He didn't pay attention that crap. You know, any K10 and Joel Marko overnight to the six. In fact, before the show this morning, Robert and I were talking about hockey. About 16 on it. Hockey, hockey, hockey. How do you like that? I probably shouldn't say that then. He'll get knocked off that morning show. Now, some of these factors may have Robert Parker and Bearfoot and did I mention it? I don't know. I don't know. I'll take this up. It would be the qualifies. Write that down immediately. If not sooner. Robert Parker and Bearfoot and. Bearfoot. We be Bearfoot and in fact, he also think I think that song he says. We be Bearfoot and then he say that. He does say that. We be Bearfoot and I think he was one of the first people to be speaking. Boo Bonix on on a also what was the other illiterate thing. Romeo and what was it? See's even a Romeo's? What does that song I'm trying to think of? I don't know. Oh, these all these but goodies reminds me of you. Who the hell did that? No, no, don't you remember that? Yeah, talked about that. These all these but goodies reminds me of you. Oh, my God. He can remind me of the desk. It's not a list. All week long. Can we put it on today? Fine. What? I don't think they had any other heads today. Easy peasy. Yeah. I love this. I love this. I love this. That's one of my favorite songs by the way. I like it a lot. I already wrote it down. In fact, I was Ben Alec Anderson's favorite song. Joe Friday on my mind. I love the way some of these people facts me. Some of these imperious kind. I mean, I appreciate your facts as very much. We love them and the set of a butt. It's always like I can't believe. And that's exactly what it says. Jeez. I can't believe you missed Goge Grant wayward wind about 1960 or so. First of all, I was like 50, much earlier in 60. Right in our timeframe, I never heard from her again says Rick. Well, Rick. Suddenly, there's a valley by Goge Grant was number nine on the charts. He had two hits. So there you go, Mr. Smartie. Thanks. Thank you very much. But you're wrong. Also, here's one. It says two songs from the 80s. Sorry, don't know what the name of the band. Abercadabra Steve Miller band. Not a number one wonder. And also Angel is a centerful Jay Giles band. I wrote those on there. Oh, I wrote the whole story. Both of those groups had multiple orgasms and multiple hits. So I have no idea what they're talking about. This one goes on the left right now. I thought we were going to head of on there. Yes. What? Not yet. Look at what he did. I double-check. Great song. I'm barely other smash. Oh, she's been here. It's a cool part by the small faces. And that is a bunch of other good stuff on this particular one. Good stuff on all of these. But this is not a one-in-one. Your chair is British invasion. By 1963 I was shouts, needles and pins. And somebody else who certainly wasn't small potato's Ned Latsahits. So we never hear his music for some reason. Team pinning. Yeah. The fact that he also got a genius. He looked a little bit like Tom Walling. Now that big of it. Do you hear it? At least in the shower. Darling. I had to say that. But if we're on some Tulsa. And maybe this could be the best song of all time. You know. Oh, great. Very. And this is just a bad recording on this. It was recorded this story. You know that? Yes, it was. Yeah. Just to stay on track. If you can park with the last one we wrote on the last song. Right. I think you only can go to this song back from me. But some of all time it is. The quote. You're recording quality. Now that's all the else. Huh? That's all the beons. Moody Blues and Go Now. Boa, tell you. Makes me want it. So right now. Oh, another really good group. Traumload. In an even better group. The Hollies. Yeah. I'm sure like the Hollies. I like the Hollies a lot. Anybody don't like the Hollies the comment is. I had their greatest hit. The old Bernoulli. The old Bernoulli. You're being deported. You George too. See the girl with similar other fanglers and some in from the door. Now we got the animals. We got to go to this place. And a bunch of there are some groups on here. I never even heard of before. And of course the very very amusing. Herman's woman. He was thrown everything that would be his life. He was here. He was here. He was here. He was here. See there was so much great music. The problem is that if you live in South Florida you'll never hear any of it. That's the only problem as you got like your own great collection like we have. Like the foundation. This is then they also had a doofy of buttercup. So we have a one-year one. And we put Telstar on or what? That was on the first list. Okay. Because it is on here but I want to play it again. What about Alan Price? Simon Smith and his amazing dancing beer. How about senior black? Answering a piece of question. Is still a silver. And I say senior silver black. Anyone who had a heart. Anyone who had a heart. Anyone who had a heart. You better put that on there. Still a high spell that. See I LLA. Still a heart. Okay. What did him say? Anyone who had a heart. I just got to say. I know. He went away at a hard. Also I've got these pages from our one hit one-year website. And I took what I did was I took 1962. And I took 1990. See what I'm saying? So we have like a. Because if we do it all from one decade then like blacks out a bunch of old people out there. Especially the punks. I mean if you're like 25, when you say like when you're about 10 years old as when you start getting interested music about. Yeah about 10. So if you're 25 that means 15 years ago as when you started listening to music, popular music and whatever. And that makes you like 87. Oh, you're laughing. But it goes to sure how old we're getting. Really old. Ancient. Even Roberts getting up there. Get a little along in the tooth. But the fact is that if you start listening to 87, I mean what do you know about the, you know I mean let's see. Listen to magic or stuff like that. And nobody listens to magic. That's what I'm hearing. That's what Richard told me. Since we got that new PD and we're we're up Schmitz Creek without a paddle. Without it without a camp. So let's see 1990 on this page. D-light. And then again, I don't know any of these songs. D-light. Groove is in the heart. Yeah. Good. It wasn't around or not. Good. It was a good dance song. Good or not. It was like you know. That was a good. That was a good dance song. Here's a man who mumbles any waffles folks. I don't want to say it's good. I'll see if a breakfast mart de waffle house. It was fine. D-light. That's with three E's by the way. D-E-E-A-D-E-L-I-T-E. Put it on there. Do you like Groove is in the heart? I don't. If you played it right now, I wouldn't know it. You didn't you'd know it if I played it. It was all I was. Candy man. Not can boots. Huh? Only the atoms get here. That was like a credit card commercial. Not a good song, huh? I never heard of that. Perfect gentleman. Ula-La. I can't get over you. Don't know it. Faith no more by epic. Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Faith no more is the artist epic as the song. See, it could be the other way around or it could be on epic records, which I'm sure wasn't. Got it? Got it. Khyper and TikTak Toe. Never heard of it. Kalloway I want to be rich. I remember Kalloway shows you how well I am. I'm ancient. Not as old as mold, but I'm ancient. Kalloway I want to be rich. Never heard of it. I'm working. And was it good? Uh, no, but it was catchy though. Heh heh heh heh. Well, okay, if catchy, if catchy qualifies, because don't worry, be happy by bobbing me with firm. We did put that on there, right? Yes, we did. Okay, well, it certainly wasn't good, but it was catchy. Same genre. Yeah, okay, so, what did I just say? What was the name of it? I forgot already. Kalloway and I want to be rich. He's Polk Kalloway. Oh, with a K. With a C, with a C as in C you next time, Mr. Biz Marky just a friend. I remember it. And. Yeah, sure. Okay. V-I-Z Marky, M-A-R-K-I-E, no relation to Marky Mark. What was he with? What was he with? I want to be rich. Or maybe I want to be fat rich. You got his Marky and just a friend? Yep. Okay. Let me put a little line on my thing right there. Well, this is, you know, when I first talked about doing this, I thought to myself, this is a massive mammoth undertaking. I mean, what hit wonders, there have been like thousands of them. And then I thought to myself, well, it's a summertime. It's the dorms, it's the dog days. We can kill some good time with this. Plus the audience likes it. Oh, at least most of them doing it once they don't move to them. I got, I got 50,000 stories I got to get to here today, but you know, let's interspersiate with some good cram. Right? Absolutely. Knowing I love you so. Anyone. You know, I know I looked at that up because I have my yellow mark on my CD here, but boy, it seems to me, Silla Blackhead's some other hit. You know, I could be wrong, but capital records. I'll look it up again. Just to be sure, we want to be scientific on this one, baby. We want to get it right. It may not be good, but at least it'll be right. Speaking of getting it right, yes. Did we put this on there yet? Couldn't get it right. They didn't have any other hits from this, but they. What the hell is this? I'm actually a blue band. Oh, yeah. I qualify, doesn't it? Well, for now, I'm going to have to look it up. So I can't think of any other hits. No, they did. I love you. It was number 12. Really? So guess what? Yes, what? Mr. Smarty pants. What we know is great, and that's unmatched. That's the Armadillo Cafe. Well, I remember when they first started out back when I was on Zeta. And they used to sit over that crimp relay. Oh, God, I thought to myself, this is just like dying and going to heaven. And all of the food they sit over was spectacular. Well, the good news is back in those days, they used to be in some little bum fort place over on TV road extension. And from the outside, it looked like, you know, so a lot of people probably missed out. Although they did extremely well. They became extraordinarily popular, which is why for 14 years in a row. Armadillo Cafe has been listed as one of the top. The most popular restaurants in all of our county. And other in a great even better new location, that's on University Drive in a pizza lot of plants right behind here. One imports were cities were phased to be between 5.95 and Griffin Road. Right there on University in Davy and boy, the food is out of this world. Try the appetizers like the Tequila Grill Trimpa with corncakes or the Temporal and Princess Conc. Only the best ingredients in all their goodies. Then order one of their terrific spinach salads, if you like, would blaze pecans or the pistachio-crested mozzarella salad with lemon-vaziled dressing. I'm not going to go back to the on-phrase that I can't pronounce. But I will tell you about the pancier de la Tale snack or with roasted peppers of the Seabass with sweet corn and vio glaze. It doesn'ts and dozens of mouthwatering on trays all kinds of neat unique things on a menu and for dessert the desserts will be a perfect ending to a phenomenal feast. Try the Armadillo Crayne Brulei like I said it's the best in the world or the warm chocolate fitters covered in hot fudge. Hopefully by this October I'll be have lost enough weight I can try that right on the year. Okay, they'll number you then. Yeah, they will. Warm chocolate fitters covered in hot fudge.

Yes, yeah, but we never played it though I'd like that hello, Bonna hello, Fata by Alan Sherman Get serious That was already under it lost Whoo this is some project man. I'll tell you that right now. Can I at least get to like a little a bit of this little bit of that in between all this music stuff For example from the CBS news website John Askcroft Minister of Fair writes CBS news dot com's dick mire He says who needs terrorists when we have John Ashcroft to scare us out of our pants The way the attorney general detonated the dirty bomber case this week completes his metamorphosis from a common press hogged with genuine fear-monger That askcroft insisted they had a scoop all the other terror warriors Miseries Mueller wolfwitz and Thompson and make the announcement about Jose Padilla aka Abdullah al-Mohaijir in a patty performance from Moscow shows what a camera-moth askcroft is That askcroft overstated the threat of the Padilla plot and of dirty bombs as weapons and mass destruction shows with a grieges clarity how welling askcroft is to use scare tactics to grab headlines control the news agenda and make himself look good In his Monday statement askcroft said an apprehending al-Mohaijir as he sought entry into the US We disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb By Monday night my colleagues Jim Stewart was reporting that FBI sources were backing off askcroft's assertion That there was a specific developer real plan to use a dirty bomb in the US by Tuesday morning the deputy of fence secretary Paul Wolfwitz The administration's hardest hardliner was telling CBS news that I don't think there was actually a plot behind some fairly loose talk And al-Mohaijir's coming in here obviously to plan for their deeds by Wednesday morning Whitehouse sources were telling US today that askcroft had been chastised for overplaying the Padilla plot On Monday askcroft also said that a radioactive dirty bomb involves exploding a conventional bomb that not only kills victims in the immediate vicinity But also spreads radioactive material that's highly toxic to humans that can cause mass death and injury in truth while dirty bombs are extremely dangerous It's an exaggeration to say they'll cause mass death and injury the conventional explosion that initiates a dirty bomb can cause death and destruction The immediate vicinity of the blast of the effects of the radiation that is spread that our long-term and very uncertain Perhaps the worst effect of a dirty bomb our fear and panic askcroft did his part The crazy thing is that all Mohajir does seem to be an actual bad guy and al-Qaeda's act of interest in using dirty bombs It uncutably is a success that he was apprehended askcroft didn't need to exaggerate the threat and scarce more than necessary to get some credit for that success This is a pattern with the attorney general in October Askcroft presented over two general organs about impending active terror in his October 29th warning He said the administration's concluded based on information developed that there may be additional terrorist attacks within the US and against US interest over the next week Askcroft was gently criticized then for scaring not calming in a way that didn't make a safer or more prepared The same was true in April when he put another hastily arranged road announcements at Stiam and Pittsburgh to warn that banks and northeast could be terror targets It's important enough that there is no specific threat to any specific situation Ascroft said we're not asking the banks to close the origin people to stay away from banks So why bother to make the announcement? Well, it was a slow Friday and a good chance of leading all three network news broadcast The administration's taking heat lately for timing its news making the further its political agenda President Bush proposed the new homeign security cabinet agency just as Congress was starting its own connected dot hearings And as the FBI whistleblower was preparing to testify the hearings continues the pediatopla was unveiled Minister of Prop again to airy fly sure hates to hear stuff like that Look he said these very few people who want to make such an outlandish political accusation Represent the most cynical among the most partisan and they're not to be taken seriously go ahead Are you call a son patriotic? Personally, I think fly sure should be proud of his team's agenda control prowess They kept the whole man security agency announcement a secret they tended to eclipse a negative story Is it to give proposal more momentum in Congress? That's called politics or governing or statecraft Democrats and reporters shouldn't be shocked and a White House spinner shouldn't ride around on their high horse But scaring people's another matter and it's turning the Department of Justice into the Ministry of Fear Right CBS news is Dick Meyer 1014 at 560 WQM if you're a fear that your mattress is headed you're not gonna good night sleep and you're waking up feeling like crap and you're back as all sorts of a day Get yourself a great mattress because what a difference it makes in the way you feel when you called dollar mattress Deliver right you do or when you want them to be there the best mattress that money can buy they got Simmons and King Coil Seely Surda you've heard all these top names will they got them all and they've got a deep select to be one two So they never give you the old bait and switch and substitute with some off-brand or some actress that really don't want And when you do business with dial a mattress and call them at 1 800 macros don't forget you picked today in the tour window for your delivery It's almost unheard of any day seven days a week when you come to be there as opposed to hey just sit around on your ass all day And maybe we'll show up like most of the other companies do you pick the time like noon to two on Tuesday or one to three on Thursday or whatever How do you want and also they give you that 30 day in home comfort guarantees you can test a new mattress the only smart way by sleep and on and out with some sales Whole standing over your shoulder.

He's a where-looking dude that looks like a retarded Michael J. Even though that shack is a big dude. When he runs up and down the court, he looks like a buffoon. He says he's a naplate or rapper and a thorough poet. Yeah, that's what he thinks. But he's just a goof that plays the hoop with that jackass Kobe. And every time I turn on my TV set at my place, I see the shud he's got that dope be-look on his face that shud guy. Shud guy! I can't help but laugh at him. Every time that dummy makes a rap CD, no one buys it. And if this eyes were any closer on a stomach space, He'd look like a down-sim-jump kid that dribbles to ball with one eye. You can get it in a Cinderella by my dad when a kid hits it in selectively. Best of all that stuff he made from cigarettes at high five 60starén Security. Most of all, degrees pitch and auditors, Dynid funeral mass, notorious mob boss John Coddy will be in Turdon-Abroman Catholic cemetery alongside his son, but his family was denied permission to hold a funeral mass for the convicted killer. Coddy responsible for at least five murderers during his bloody reign atop the Gambino crime family, will not receive a mass of Christian burial of ever an end-ru of a curry, Chancellor of the Dynisies of Rupon, said yesterday. Instead, Vacari said in the one sentence statement, there could be a mass for the dead sometime after the burial of John Coddy. Coddy died of cancer Monday to prison hospital in Missouri of the late 19th century, but the decision on the massacre that was made by church officials after the Gaudy ordered murder of his Gambino predecessor, Big Paul Castelano in 1985. Castelano's family received permission for a private mass after his burial, but was denied a funeral mass within the body of the church. With the body in the triad, like that, otherwise they don't want his body inside the church. Maybe out on the step, on the stoop. But unlike Gaudy Castelano was also denied burial in Catholic cemetery because of his life of crime, Gaudy's remains removed from the Missouri prison on Tuesday for their eventual return to New York and his family which has been splitted by federal prosecution. Two of his brothers has son and ex-son, Laura Jald at the time of his death, another brother and an nephew were under indictment. Coddy will end up in the family muscle team that holds his son Frank who died in 1980, age 12, when he was accidentally struck by neighbors' car. Members' neighbor that we talked about, they got murdered? Yes. Mysteriously, John Favara. The Muslims in Saitan John Cemetery in Queens were an assurment of mafia figures found their final resting spots. Those buried at St. John's include Carl Gambino, Carmine Galante, Vito Genevase and Charles Laquiluciano, and of course, D'Avito Colione. Once there's an aspen to not say why Gaudy was deemed qualified to be very in the Catholic cemetery, in addition to Castelano and Gaudy, the church is denied a funeral mass to other mobsters, Galani and Gaudy under boss Frank the Tico. At issue as a church precept called scandal, the idea that by granting a funeral mass to someone who lived outside church teachings, the wrong message would be sent to the church faithful. Oh my God. Thank you. That's the conference in Dallas by the West School and I right now. But I guess I guess you must be listening to the show in one earpiece. It's just bad timing from the die right now, okay? Because the world is watching real close. The denial is not a judgment on the deceased lifestyle since the church believes that only God can make that determination. So that's the excuse for taking his money. But when I started to say before I read that was in reading all of the New York papers except the times, of course, which is too stud, I didn't read anything about the Goddien the times, but the post and news day and daily news. Every columnist and most of the stories were like, they liked him. Right. Does that surprise you? Because he was a snappy dresser. I bet you're bill blast. That's probably why Bill just finally gave up, you know? Give up the battle. Maybe his best customer just died. In Howard, this is by Steve Dunlivian yesterday's New York post and it's just amazing to me. He says in Howard Beats, the colors are breadbite and blue of the best flag in the world as revered as much as motherhood. Under that flag stood 14 year olds Brian Sakko and Mike Fauci clutching a $15 spray of flowers. The boys, students at MS202 left a simple note in the flowers, sorry for your loss. Sorry, Mr. Of course, this was on a corner of 160-1180-50 Howard Beats where the boys were going to drop off their respects to the Goddien family. Brian, no, I never saw him. My grandmother once pointed out a son John to me. All I hear is that Mr. Goddien kept climbed down. Out of the mouths of babes. They brought their offerings to the Burgat hunt and fish, bloody Supreme Court of Goddien's rulings. Richie Goddien, John's brother, came to the door at 150 pm and was extremely polite and was proud that this neighborhood was so patriotic. His older brother, Pete, a former sanitation worker, wouldn't talk to me because he's in the slam. Outside the club again those wonderful flags of the US sent by well-wishers, but Carmine Romeo said something that struck me with stunning irony. There is no better flag than that, but who works behind the cover of that flag he said. The same people who believed known felons like Salvaturgrafano, these people behind this great flag promoted Gravano and did this to John Goddien. Now before you think I start thinking I'm a website called JohnGottieSimpathy.card.com forget about it. Goddien had a new time because the bureaucrats who are high behind that flag said so. If I were a judge and thankfully I'm not, I would have given John some jail time, but locked in a tomb for life and led him to die like a dog where he's giving more scot with his fingers to the arms of his loved ones to say to her, he knows who's talking to him. This is a disgrace. Guard's taking written notes from Goddien to say to his wife he loves her. This is a disgrace. Those people who hide behind that flag is that justice for which we love that flag asked Carmine Romeo. Romeo had paced in a dollar bill to the door of the hunting fish club and he said that dollar represents how generous he was. I left change underneath that represented the poor people he helped out. When a woman was burned out of her apartment, he got a renewing and paid for redecoration in rent. John Goddien's steering generous was bigger than New York bigger than Hollywood bigger than any one of us. He said, Now while I think Carmine's going overboard, what the hell would we all be doing if it wasn't for the John Goddies of the world, we'd have newspapers that focused on the stepper or steppered wives. What would the De Niro and Pachina McCapollons grow sazy going to do? The fascinated by these good fellows, although they may be bad fellows, I asked Richie what's the best memory of John Goddie. I was lucky enough to be his brother, he said, Richie old son, your brother was a wise guy, but I'll miss him too. Right, Steve Dunlavy in the New York Post, they're just amazing to me. Yep. We like, we like the mobsters, man. We like them. We're obsessed with them. I don't care what anybody says. Yeah. We weren't happy when sunny Goddien on a causeway. The Pelelemo says, what is bad hair piece, you know? We're gonna like that. Oh, you're pissed off. That's right. We like the Coyote family. Because they were family. Right? Right. And Mavacoyote made a hell of a pasta. And some ends of me to hell of a sauce. First you've got to throw in your sauces and the sauce and you need balls of wine, your sugar, cut the crap. I like that one. St. Tina says, cut the crap. He's still in the sauce. Itless and Flamens are couldn't keep all that weight on without being a good Italian cook. You know that. Right. And of course you got to you got to bulk up a little bit because you'd have no longer ID how long you're going to have to go to the mattresses. Huh? I guess you can always get take out from Luis in a Bronx. More on that story we've been talking about in Tontan Mass. You know, these have a dog track in Tontan Mass. I'm on if they still do. I'm at your the beast would know. A stone called Adel Burrow cult leader admitted yesterday that he intentionally starved a son to death over an excruciating 51 days in 1999 to fulfill a twisted religious vision that he now says was wrong. This is the latest on the story about the assholes that starved a kid to death. It was a product of a lot of mistakes in misunderstandings between my wife and I, Jacques Robito, said of his reason for sticking to the bizarre prophecy that led him to sit idly by as a son Samuel's side slowly of malnutrition. We're in past court appearances, Robito's been defined in arrogant, sprouting anti-government propaganda declaring sovereignty. Yesterday he was contrite and humble. He choked back tears during three hours of testimony in Tontan Superior Court during which he accepted full responsibility for his 11 month old son's heinous death. Remember those cookies heinous heinous heinous? Hmm. The buck stops with me. He answered flatly when asked by prosecutor Waltershe if anybody also the cuff forced him to stop feeding his son. Robito, a 29 year old graduate of North Adel Burrow High School explained that his wife Karen was distrutt by their son's weight loss and wanted to feed the boy but it convinced her to adhere to the deadly plan because the group thought they were following God's orders. Kind of sounds like our friend there in Texas. What those are named a killer five kids? Um, yeah, that's when they forget. Yeah, that's right. What's your name? Yeah, my robbery. Yeah, yeah, and Ray Yates. Thank you, Robert. And her husband was the nutcase with a religious crap and talking to living living in the trailer and all this other crap God, to involved in that friend of yours there. What was his name? Mike Warniki. Mike Warniki. Warick, whatever the hell is name was? My reaction to it was that in order for me to be a good father and a good husband. It was my time to be strong in a situation and to follow through on whatever it is that God was giving us at that time he testified in chilling in chilling the tale that we call how the boy went from being a healthy and chubby baby Learning to walk to any mobile wafew whose bony appearance sick in his own mother He began losing weight, Robert O'Sedus, face became thinner. His cry wasn't a normal baby's cry was more like that. Yeah Didn't have the energy to cry Before Samuel's aunt Michelle Mingo handed down the bizarre vision from God the tabard been eating crackers Cheerios yogurt and applesauce In addition to being breastfed quoting scripture, mingo 37 told a second March 199 that God was upset with Karen Robert O'S vanity and wanted to put around a high protein high high-fat diet What have I always told to the religious people are the crazy people Oh God was upset with her vanity and wanted to put around a high protein high fat diet Baby God's been in touch with Bob Atkins, you know what? The vision also called for her to drink a gallon of almond milk every day and to feed Samuel only breast milk But because she was pregnant she couldn't produce enough milk in nourished the boy He ground his teeth, Robert O'Sedus on final days toward the end he would often bite down on Karen's nipple at times his eyes would roll back in was head His skin on his chest changed to a dark color of it getting a white chalky substance in his diaper. Oh God Sick sick like I said the more religious they are the sicker they are Take your religion and shove it take all your goddamn hoax pocus and your Bubba myses and stick a more limo and shine but leave your all arrest of us alone and any of these Religious nuts who are row are reproducing like that they should have those kids taken away at birth.

They're holding their feet to the fire so to speak Bishop, both in Gregory president of the US conference of Catholic bishops will not predict how bishop might section themselves and did not set any specific proposals But he said he expects the issue to be debated as the bishops discuss a new Mandatory national policy ended for betting and responding to instances of sexual abuse of mine is by priests Conference later strongest suggested that the draft policy released ice week will be toughened by weeks end The question of accountability of bishops is a burning issue and I have every reason to believe that Particular topical receives significant debate Gregory said I clearly agree that topical be a matter that needs discussion The nations' vishops have gathered at a hotel in Dallas for an extraordinary meeting to discuss an extraordinary crisis Over the last six months since the tales are reported of how the arts dice is a Boston Transfer to Reverend John Gigg in despite knowing he'd been accused of molesting boys the scandal has engulfed the nation's largest religious Anomination the church is moral authority and financial strength have been threatened and advocates of reform from the left and the right of enclimoring for change as in now The churches decline to release overall statistics but lawyers news papers and interest groups have estimated that as many as 1,500 priests Amalested children in the last five decades and many bishops have failed to remove those priests from the ministry and they all should be in jail The ones that are still alive put them in jail right now do not pass go do not collect $100 do not get one free molestation all of them in goddam jail And you know something they can probably have a pretty good time in there.

I just mentioned I didn't vote for, but it's a great song. Somebody just passed this into us from the Washington Post. We never realized that representative Bob Barr, the Georgia Republican was so despised Bill Clinton that he demanded his impeachment. Before the monoclevince key scandal was such a delicate hot house flower. While it turns out that Barr was deeply hurt by all those slings and arrows during his 1990 ordeal as a Republican impeachment manager. Barr was so wounded, in fact, that he's filed suit and watched in federal court against the former president, Fint and Loyalist James Carvelle and politically active pornography Larry Flint, seeking compensatory damages and excessive 30 million dollars for loss of reputation and emotional distress and injury to his personal property, allegedly caused by these three, whom Barr claims conspired to hinder the plaintiff in the lawful discharge of his duties. Oh, my God. When Barr's normally media friendly lawyer, judicial watch president Larry Clayman initially declined to come out of lawsuit, we sense that something highly unusual was a foot. The suit was filed very quietly back in March, but didn't come to light until yesterday when Flint issued a press release. Maybe Barr, who was mummier today, thought the publicity wouldn't help his top primary race against Republican John Linder and other Republican incumbent in their firstly redron congressional district. Defended Flint, Flint, meanwhile declared this time, Barr has kicked a wrong dog. Defended Carvelle told us to call this suit frivolous would be to elevate the status of frivolous. Clinton's attorney David Kendall said the claims have no legal merit and will be defended vigorously. In due course, the strangely medicine claim and said, I know which to comment on the substance of the case. However, it is serious and a congressman is confident of prevailing said the right wing asshole. How do you like that, huh? What a pussy. Yeah. Oh, he's going to sue me now. Focus on the family, uh, judicial watch, all these right wing wacko groups have got all these very goody two shoes sounding names, you know? All bunch of fascist maniacs. I look what's our pulse got to about how to use the chain. I still got a spelled wrong. You see, who park will get a right? At least we got a couple that is right anyway. Contours, do you love me? He's got four. Thomas Dolby, she blighted me with science, which you laughed and scoffed at that. Yeah, that's got four type or number one so far. You laughed your ass off at that. Speaking of music, Harold reports two musicians have filed a lawsuit against Brittany Spears claiming that two songs on our multi-platten and second album, Oops, I did again, were based on a two-day road. Philadelphia, songwriter's Michael Cotrell and Lawrence Woonowski, WNUKO, WSK, how do you say that? Don't you? Lawrence, Nukowski, claim in the lawsuit that they wrote recorded and copyrighted a song called, what you see is what you get in late 1999 and submitted it to one of Spears representatives or consideration on the future album. The song was rejected, lawsuit says, but the musicians claim that the 20-year-old pop singer later released two songs, what you see is what you get and can't make you love me that were virtually identical to the song, May 7, the lawsuit filed Friday in US District Court in Philadelphia named Spears, Zomba Recording Corporation, Jive Records, right under 10 in group and VMG music publishing, a call to spirit policies was not... returned immediately returned. How'd you guess? Oh, I just lucky. The liner notes for Upsided again credit both songs to several writers and producers that share on studios the Swedish Recording Studio that also wrote hits for the Backstreet Boys and Stink and the Anxious Canadian Celine Dion. Oh, brother. Speaking of music, Guess who's making it comeback? Vanilla Ice. The King is making it comeback. There's no hyphen in itchiku, by the way. For Eric, he keeps changing it. It's all drawn just followed by the way. Don't play, Eric. I didn't tell him nothing about the hyphen. Yeah, there's no hyphen. There's no graphen and there's no hyphen. It's all one word. You've got it spelled right now. Just take the hyphen out and you'll have it. Nice going, Eric. Oh! Oh no! Yeah, that probably was the problem. A dance remix of a little less conversation which pressling performed in 1968 film, a little bit of a lot has been drawing brisk sales and heavy radio airplane Britain since it was released. There's a single on Monday and the King is back. Even dead for 100 years and the King is back. They can't keep him down. The recordings expected at top of British singles charts the next week, breaking the long running tie between Pressley and the Beatles for the most number one hits in the UK, which currently stands at 17 apiece and RCA spokesman said, Guess who's going to break that by the way. Very soon. I give up. Westlight. You were... I'm just telling you. I'm not asking for a commentary. I don't care whether you like him or don't like him. I'm just telling you they're going to break the record. Okay. Soon. The original version of the song reached number 69 on the West single's charts in 1968 and failed to chart it all in Britain. And that amazing? In other words, it was a stiff. I don't even remember it, do you? No, not at all. A little less conversation. But the record books will contain an asterisk as the new recording takes some liberties with the songs originally performed by the King. The updated version of a little less conversation adds a minute longer electronic introduction. Smask personally vocals with new rhythms and beats and extends the song with dance loops and techno tracks. Oh yeah. Talk about phony baloney. They can do that with any song. Sure. If you hear the first man, in fact, it wouldn't be surprised that Disney's going to start playing Elvis now. At least to be good variety from that same 20 songs he's playing. If you hear the first minute of the song, you'd have no idea that Elvis, it sounds like a techno song, says RCA General Manager Richard Sanders. And when you hear his voice kick in, it's like, oh my God, that's Elvis. Oh my God. Oh my God. Yeah, like that. Sanders says it marks the first contemporary remix of a Presley's music allowed by RCA, a unit of Bertelsman AG's a BMG. RCA owns rights to the original master recordings of Presley's entire catalog, the spokesman said. The six-minute plus recording, six minutes plus. Yeah. I'll boy, we could kill some good time with that on this show. And guess where I'll be able to hit it no doubt. Amsterdam. You must be psychic. It says the six-minute plus recording is the work of popular Amsterdam based DJ and producer JXL. He was licensed by RCA and Elvis Presley and a prize is to remix the song for the soundtrack to Nike's $90 million worldwide ad campaign tied to the World Cup soccer tournament. The full length remix of three-minute version edited for radio and the original version of the song or all contained on a single, which is due for released in the US on June 25. Boy, I'm sure going to go out and buy that right away, aren't you? Right now. June 25, that's only like a lesson two weeks away. The original song also appeared last year on a soundtrack to the hit movie Ocean's 11, which star George Cloney and Brad Pitt, who's still looks pretty good but still can't act. What that was that movie, I saw a little bit of within the other day. The river runs deep. Boy, that's right. Craig Sheffer was in that movie with Brad Pitt where he played his brother. And Craig Sheffer by that time had gotten a terminal case of the agrees and his eyes were not only like bloodshot and like rat cool eyes, but like his whole face was coming apart, Craig Sheffer. Yes. The river runs and the river runs through it. I'm a big of a horn. The river runs through it. I think that's a river. Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert. Robert, Robert, Robert, Robert was in that movie. Now he directed it. Oh. Well, anyway, to make a long story short, Brad Pitt dies in the end. He falls in he's a swimmer. I mean, he's fishing and he dies. I thought he got killed by the bear. No, did he? I might have been a different movie. Presley's likely return of the charts again this fall on RCA. Really this is a one CD collection of 30 of his number one hits to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his death. Oh, gee, I didn't realize that. This falls the 25th anniversary of Elvis's death. The album title Elvis 30 number one hits is due out September 24th in the US. I hope you mark and he's dates down on a calendar. Right now. He died August 16th, 1977, a Memphis Tennessee age 44. I'm going to say it again. Anybody who goes to Grace Land is an asshole. He needs a life needs mental help. Then it includes all those guys who called in about what we do it about four years ago.

Again, somebody very emphatic, very emphatic. I wonder what story they're talking about. Is hearing a story like that makes me sick. I almost had a trainer radio off the bass. Oh, it must be about the A of the baby's baby. It made me sick also. But then he writes on your faith. No more question mark they had. Hits midlife crisis, which still gets radio played. How can they be a one-hit wonder? What about E-Z? They need to be removed. Well, guess what? No. No, they're going to be removed because you're wrong.

Because I saw it on TV, must have slipped my mind. McDonald's had spam to the menu. Did you see that? Yeah. But only in Hawaii. Sure. It's big there. The 78 McDonald's restaurants in Hawaii are adding a new menu item. That's as much in American icon as the burger chain itself. spam. Oh. I'm getting a joke. I'm just thinking about it. Couldn't say it. God. The idea that there's there's servant something that comes in a can. More than 3,000 portions of low sodium spam. Spam, scrambled egg and rice were serving a single day during a test run of the meal. According to Malani, O'Kazaki. That's right. O'Kazaki McDonald's local marketing manager. I'm not sure why it's taken so long. O'Kazaki said of this fan breakfast, which he said is offered at no other McDonald's in the world. Only in Hawaii. So I guess they want to keep the population as big and porked up as as so many of those sumo looking guys are. And women. Porky. Give her see those. What do they call when they have those those? They have those those blue out kind of those shows they put on right. Almost all of them are like turkey. I'm not saying there aren't a lot of beautiful people in Hawaii because there are, but they don't get involved in those shows. But they like their porcupine over there. They're busy getting laid. They like their pork though. M&M has received death threats from supporters of Osama, Yumama Bidla, the corner reports who say M&M may be getting a little too quirky himself. I guess. The video for his new hit single without me shows the rap singer making fun of the terror warlord by wearing a beard and robes and dancing around as binge-shady. His joke is believed to have offended been laden's al-Qaeda networking, US intelligence agency informed M&M that a bounty has been placed on his head. A source told the Daily Star M&M has had no choice but to take the thread very seriously. He has hired more professional bodyguards to protect him and updated his own security system. He's even consulted with a specialist in counterterrorism of what precautions to take. The Detroit stars often court in controversy with references to sex drugs and violence in his songs. In the past, he's been convicted of curing concealed weapon and claims to take ecstasy while on stage and believe me it doesn't help. He still can't sing a lick. He may be can lick it, but he can't sing. And an oyster the crap out of me. I don't know about you, but he an oyster the crap out of me. He's buggy. He was, you know, in the beginning he was amusing. You know what I mean? He was amusing. Like weird ale, kind of amusing. But as time wore on, he became more and more obnoxious and more and more like, hey, we don't need to see him no more. I rather see Afroman any day. Huh? How about Eminem with an Afro? That sounds good. In fact, he may soon get one from the sound of it. Thomas Dolby, she blinded me with science as number one with the, well, see, just a so sprite out. Huh? I'm sure just a spite me. 103 votes on a poll. And it's so sprite out that we got nobody other than Yine so far. Debbie Boone got five. Well, does that surprise look? It was number one for 10 weeks. Somebody must have liked it. Yeah, but I didn't think we had those people in the audience. Maybe we have five women, listen, I'm sure that no man would vote for Debbie Boone and you let up my life. No real man or even me. Contour is, do you love me, got seven? The small faces, it's a coup-park spelled right. Oh, has got the six. Rick Derranger, rock and roll, who she coup has got five as does Debbie Boone and you let up. And the buckles and video killed the radio star. Even though we don't have the one in George wants me to. I got news for her. What, what you heard is what you get. I'll find it. I'm going to go out and buy no more buckles. Okay, if you want to download it and steal it, I mean borrow it. That's up to you. USA today, Judy Kean and Lawrence McQuillen right today. The announcement Monday that US officials had named and lived Del Cuita terrorist who would plan to explore a radio-like of Dirty Bomb and USA. Mesh neatly with President Bush's agenda. It came four days after Bush proposed a homeland security department in his cabinet and says that 10 days after he began describing a doctrine of preemptive military strikes against countries that threaten the US. It seemed to add impetus to his argument that Saddam Hussein must be ousted before Iraq sells weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. But some people, especially some Democrats wondered Tuesday whether the arrest announcement Dovetail a little too tidally with Bush's agenda. Those questions were fueled by the fact that the announcement came a month after Abdullah al-Muhajir's arrest may 8 and by reports Tuesday that he had no radioactive material, no concrete plan and no target. Other than that, he was pretty dangerous. It would just be interesting to know why any particular days chosen more than a month after the fact to make an announcement, especially announcement of this magnitude said Mark Millman, a Democratic pollster, of the Democrats in Washington said the same thing privately. Bush's stage managing a public pronouncements to serve his goals is a technique every president's used. Trying to dominate news coverage remind voters that he and fellow Republicans are leading the war on terror is a perquisitive of a day presidency. White House spokesman, Eric Flesher said Tuesday that the Dirty Bomb threat was not overstated. It was described accurately. He said it times like this. The initial reports immediately lurched to the worst case scenario. Flesher said the timing had nothing to do with Bush's announcement last week, but they proposed Homeland Security Department. Attorney General John asked Proptoon to answer your response from Moscow, where he was meeting with Russian officials on unbelievable the matters. We have have disrupted an unfolding terrorist party said. It wasn't long before Bush and his top kids were making the likely between the arrest and the administration's priority is on the war on terrorism. Grave threats are accumulating against us and an action will only bring them closer by President Cheney said in between heartbeats. In the speech Tuesday in Kansas City, Bush said these shadowy terrorists could hook up with a nation that's got weapons of mass destruction. The nations that I label the axis of evil, the evil doers. Late Tuesday administration officials said ask Proptoon to the Dirty Bomb threat, providing a reminder that message management can be tricky. If Bush has seen is trying to gain political edge from the threat of terrorism, Americans could lose confidence in him. There's enough of a pattern that this administration despite protest to the contrary makes political calculations every day, and says was this one, I can't say. He says Bush was screening the impression that he's playing the kind of Washington games he pledged to avoid, it may come back to Hanabies says. Americans, however, are not disenchanted with Bush, pull a show that three and four are proof of the job that he's doing. And he was said that ACNM Gallup poll last weekend, one in three said they thought the timing of Bush's announcement of a new home-on security department was based on politics. Similar numbers said the same thing when President Clinton ordered missiles for us against suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan during the monocle of Bluinsky scandal. Jim Estimberg was a deputy national security adviser to Clinton to prove the Bush's plan to create a home-on security department, doesn't care whether politics played a part in that decision or not. He says, whatever gets somebody to the right place to do the right thing, that's a good thing. Okay, you make up your own mind. If you have one. Remember that Abby killing? Yeah. Oh, you ought to see this guy. Here's, here's, wow, yeah, that's not fair. Picture of his drivers license. Everybody's picture on their drivers license. I never seen anybody look good on their drivers license, of you. Yeah, me. Too bad you don't look good in person. I know. I wish. The man who killed two monks and wounded two others at Roman Catholic Abby before killing himself had been upset with the church over his divorce, the AP learned yesterday. See where looking for a reason, right? There you go. Investigators have been struggling to undercover information about 71-year-old Lloyd Roberts, Jeffress, as they search for a motive and is attack on conception Abby, a role monastery in Northwest Missouri, in conception. Jeffress first victim, brother Damian Larson pleaded for his life before Jeffress shot him, Abba Gregory Poland said yesterday. He said, no, no, and Jeffress just plugged him with a rifle Poland said, just like this like that. Jeffress daughter and brother said he'd been upset at the way he was treated by the church after his divorce, a source posted investigation told the AP on the condition of course of anonymity. The source didn't know when Jeffress and his wife were married or divorced and could not elaborate on how the church allegedly mistreated Jeffress officials were trying to locate his former wife. The Abby about 90 miles north of Kansas City, we opened yesterday, bells at the Abby's Basilica Twirl told at 8.40am Tuesday, exactly 24 hours after the bloodshed began. The bell sounded once for each year that the two slay monks had been there. The Reverend Phil up Schuster spent 51-85 years at the Abby, Larson 64 had been there for 32 years. Well, a lot of strange stuff going on, including that confab in Dallas. So this is a tough question. What is the best way to handle this for the good of everybody? Also, we're more fun of it, but that is still a no-how many priests may actually be in that situation anyway. Is the Abby from what you're looking for? Are you believing that you lied to me with science crap with 14 votes? No. No. I think I might even have just taken that one off of there when we get through with this poll. I mean, that's just ridiculous. Fubba does pass noon at 5.60WQM. You've heard me talking about getting yourself a big one. Everybody wants a big one.

But then again, there's a lot of people out there with bad taste. We already know that. We can't help that. Five held in shoe bomber probe. Paris France, five people have been detained by French police for questioning over their possible connection with Richard C. Reed, the alleged transatlantic shoe bomber. Reed is currently awaiting trial in the US for allegedly trying to set off a bomb hit in his footwear during that play from Paris to Miami on December 22, 2001. The five suspects reported by the AP to be two Pakistanis in three North Africa owners were detained after an operation in Paris yesterday. They've been questioned by Couture S. Binau services the direct- What is it? Direction day last surveillance they tear at Twa. Of all what they know of Reed stay in Paris. Don't get me started with the French. The interviews are part of a broader anti-terror investigation presided over by Judge John Lewis' Brewer. Reed was overpowered by past years in crew while we all know that. Okay, so they got five assholes in the custody and they're grilling them. Hopefully they're beating the crap out of them too. Torturing them things like that. There were so much to civilized to be doing. Well, that article I had a couple weeks ago about the country club that we're running down the Reggitmo. That just crossed my ass.

Sudan is picked up a member of an al-Qaeda terrorist cell as believed to have tried to shoot down U.S. plane with shoulder-fired missiles in Saudi Arabia. U.S. officials told CNN yesterday. The officials said the man a Sudanese national expense and time in Saudi Arabia claimed to have penetrated security to the highly guarded Prince Sulton Air base and tried to fire a missile at U.S. military plane. The FBI should then intelligence bulletin warning of the potential targeting of commercial aircraft in the U.S. by terrorists, armed with shoulder-fired missiles after investigators last month concluded al-Qaeda's mutton tried to shoot down U.S. military plane at the remote desert base. On May 10, CNN reported the discovery earlier in the month of an expanded Russian-made S.A.7 shoulder-fired surface-to-wear missile tube and parts inside a security fence at Saudi base. An official said Wednesday they believed the man was responsible for them. Two weeks ago, CNN reported a May 22 FBI bulletin that said, subsequent investigation suggests that the discoveries likely related to al-Qaeda targeting efforts against U.S. led forces on the Arabian Peninsula. U.S. officials would not say whether U.S. law enforcement authorities had access to the detained man or where he was being held. In other words, they're not saying nothing. Meanwhile, in Dallas, they meet their whiffless, useless and unloved. I do like that, huh? I mean, this, if there was ever such a thing, the definitive dog and pony show, this is it.

Since the first voice stepped forward to be counted. Speaking of that, speaking of counting, New York Times, big article today Roman Catholic Church faces questions about finances as if they don't have enough other problems. After spending the past six months, fending off accusations that had covered up allegations of sexual abuse by priest, the American Roman Catholic Church now faces a new wave of scrutiny about how its finances are handled particularly because of the large and confidential settlements that DICs have reached with victims of that abuse. In other words, Hush money. Payoffs. In fact, some big donors to the church are leveling the same sorts of complaints that the abuse victims and their supporters have made that a church run in such secrecy for decades needs to be more open and it's decision-making and more accountable for the consequences of those decisions. Recent reports of accounting coverups most notably in Milwaukee and Palm Beach, Florida have only drawn more attention than the inability to refusal of any dice used to disclose where their money comes from or where had has gone.
